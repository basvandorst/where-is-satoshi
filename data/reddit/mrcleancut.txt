Quite possibly, someone who recognizes the tremendous opportunities for social impact in Bitcoin and in doing so has identified Andreas as an extremely worthy cause. His continued education will not only impact the world as a whole but, simultaneously allow BitGive to thrive and benefit many nonprofits world wide. That leads me to the conclusion of Connie Gallippi? 1CvJLuWsxKbXfkmHEumy8K7NRfCsMqDNhf
Edit: Whoever the hell you are, you are an amazing person! When you look back and reflect on this life, just remember the good that you did...

Just confirming because it sounds so simple but, on the ledger nano s i just simply send my coins from my legacy wallet to my segwit wallet right?
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:50:11
Yep. Just find a middleman in between. Probably your bank account like u/chocolatesouffle3 mentioned. Pay extra in fees for two wires but the gains will easy cover it:)

Looks great. Prefer this to coinmarketcap. Solid work!!

I feel like everyone is trying to “perfectly” time the dip. Although ideal, don’t worry about hitting it at its very lowest point. The general trend is upward so why not just buy when it’s down 5%-15% from the previous ATH.? You can easily do that and 2 weeks later you’ll feel like you got it on sale!

Are these the miners that are currently available on the site or are we talking about a new one?

Just posted a similar question the other day. It’s important to realize your sample size bias. Think of it like smartphones. I remember my parents barely being able to operate one, let alone understand them, 5+ years back. Now they are texting, sending gifs, and even using Apple watches. Everyone on this sub is in the vaaaast minority. Adoption takes time and I think we are quite early on.

Also, nothing wrong with opening it up a bit to Ad space. You should generate revenue for a great product.

holy shit. I'm just now discovering this! it's awesome. great job on this.

This man has the right idea. Take the bet and celebrate in a shitfaced rampage of glory.

As much as you'd like. You get to set the budget. Pretty simple to do yourself and seeing how you all created a site like this, I'm sure you could manage quite well! Or, you could always snag someone from  and have them do it for you. Wouldn't be too difficult to drum up some visits!

Wire Transfer is unlimited. I'm sure there is some cap but, I doubt any of us can get anywhere close to it. I'm talking millions here. Follow what u/tomt1112 said and DO NOT forget your reference number/code. Ensure all bank account details are under your name. I  did a transaction last week and everything went smoothly. Used Coinbase in the past but, prefer Gemini.
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:05:43
Same for me. Gemini now and 0 complaints,
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:21:30
I’ll gladly take the bet!
@_date: 2018-02-22 04:56:24
Why wouldn’t they just try to cash out a few million or something? Of course, $20 trillion will raise a bunch of red flags but a few million would probably be fine!
