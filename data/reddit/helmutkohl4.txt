ATTENTION!! WARNING!!
Your Bitstamp-Accounts are NOT SAFE!!
Yesterday I opened a Bitstamp-Account. To do so, I used a drop-email-address and after copying the User-ID and PW, - immediately - deleted it the registration-email.
At 4.38 a.m. I logged into my account, at 4.40 a.m. I changed my PW, stayed logged in and transferred &gt;8 BTC to this freshly opened Bitstamp-Account. Now there's the BUMMER:
WHILE I stayed logged in, some criminal was able to log onto my Bitstamp-Account at the SAME TIME WITH ME, using a different IP than mine. At 5.40 a.m. this criminal opened a withdrawal request to another Bitcoin-address and my Bitcoins were GONE.
Bitstamp claims they would offer two-way-authentication but what's the point of it if you get robbed even BEFORE you are able to secure your account?
Also, although this is clearly a major security-gap, Bitstamp refuses to compensate my damage! They do keep sending me messages in which they blame ME for the robbery that happened on THEIR platform. They say it's all my fault TEE-HEE.
Do not use them - in case their users accounts get hacked YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN!!!
