There is a significant load to doing due diligence on the many entities we transact with on a daily basis. All the moreso when those entities are overseas etc. The cost of doing that amounts to a caution tax.
The purpose of regulations or other efforts to created trusted systems is to outsource that work to experts who can (we hope) do it faster and better, which makes it easier to transact which makes doing business faster and more competitive which is what we want.

I know majority of people using BTC as a currency is the goal, but is this in any way true currently? I'd gotten the impression that most activity is still mining and speculation.

what do you think the overlap is between people who want to see a physical item before purchasing and people into an all-virtual unregulated currency?

They kind of do with normal money. What happens is you go to the store and look at stuff and then you load Amazon on your smartphone …
