@_date: 2014-05-06 01:01:16


That might not be necessary. I doubt "bits" and "bits" would be confused very often (if ever). It's all about context.
For example, "Send me 50 bits," "You owe me 200 bits," "A beer costs 100 bits." I can't think of a single case where someone would think you're referring to *information* bits.
@_date: 2014-02-11 07:19:45


Yeah, I've had a couple of requests to remove it in the past, but with the recent events it seemed like a good time.


See my response to [kerls]( about this.
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:38:00
I think they were saying "MT Gox", which is an old way of pronouncing the name (before it officially changed to Mt.Gox).
@_date: 2014-06-10 03:25:42


Potentially many people. How many used Mt.Gox without any guarantees their money was stored securely?
@_date: 2014-03-17 21:36:49
Wow, even I don't use it that much! Glad you find it useful.
@_date: 2014-05-06 22:21:10


Don't worry, I think many people miss that. It's not obvious unless you look at the scroll bar (which is hidden in some browsers). I'm in the middle of a minor redesign and this is one of the things I plan to improve.


Completely agree. The 'micro', 'milli', etc. prefixes were added in the last update, and it was a bit rushed. I should add a note to the Usage section, at least.


I hadn't considered that. Good idea.


Yep, that's going to be part of the next update. It'll be included along with the ability to link to specific amounts e.g. preev.com/1.5btc/usd.


You're right, it's not working at the moment! Thanks for letting me know, I'll get onto it.


At the moment it's just designed for ounces, but I'll consider adding grams. Also, it's meant to be a cryptocurrency only converter, which is why Gold to USD etc. is left out.
Thanks for the great feedback, and for the donation/unblock!
@_date: 2014-05-10 11:02:37

Yes, it seemed more important to me to remove it from the default price, as that is what's used by the vast majority of people on the site.
I'm not sure whether it's worth removing it completely, as I'm sure many people still have money tied up there (unfortunately).
@_date: 2014-06-17 19:00:17


That's interesting, I'd like to read it.
Perhaps not *unspoofable*, but economically unfeasible to spoof; similar to how Bitcoin transactions are expensive to spoof (double-spend)? Maybe it could be hard enough to spoof the location where a proof-of-work was computed that it wouldn't be worth doing.
@_date: 2014-05-06 22:25:14

Yes, I read it. He said some things I don't necessarily agree with. So what?
My only points were that the tone of your post was condescending, and that you didn't have enough information about the situation to make the assessment that he's a "serial scam victim" who'll surely get ripped off again (which is why I explained how it *could plausibly* be just a simple incorrect risk assessment).

@_date: 2014-02-25 07:57:48


That's pretty condescending (not to mention unfounded). Have you considered that Erik:
* Might not have held a large proportion of his funds on Mt.Gox (there's good reason to believe this),
* Might have seen a high risk, high return opportunity (i.e. arbitrage) and decided the risk was worth it, and
* Did not risk money he couldn't afford to lose.
I held no money at Gox, but I don't blame anyone who took the risk for arbitrage purposes (and could afford to do so)—before Bitcoin withdrawals were halted. Everyone is wrong sometimes.
@_date: 2014-05-24 07:08:52
Bitstamp wants to know how you acquired the coins, not which address(es) they were sent from. It's a privacy concern.

Yes. Your comment prompted me to look into Vertcoin. I can't promise *when* it'll be included, but it'll happen.
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:41:46
I'm on the fence about the whole regulation issue.
However, I consider Erik to be a smart guy, and I don't think he's delusional. I want to point out here that delusional and (possibly) wrong are not equivalent.
As far as I can tell, he sincerely believes that the short-term painful events that inevitably occur in unfettered markets can lead to greater resilience in the long term. I don't see how that's completely implausible. For example, recent events (read: Mt.Gox clusterfuck) appear to be creating demand for a technical solution to prevent exchanges (and hosted wallet providers) from operating on fractional reserves: see [here]( and it appears several exchanges are [following suit](
Regulation vs free markets is a pretty complex topic on which I haven't yet formed an opinion one way or the other.

Hey bitcoiners,
This is the first major update to Preev in a few months. Although it might not be obvious, it represents a lot of effort. I hope the next one won't take so long!
* Options added for 'milli' and 'kilo' prefixes, which allow you to convert millibits etc. Hint: hit 'm' OR 'k' in the left number field to toggle either prefix.
* 3 additional cryptocoins added: Litecoin, Peercoin, and Dogecoin. This takes it to 4 cryptos, and 72 total currencies (incuding precious metals).
* 5 additional data sources added: Bitfinex (for the BTCUSD pair), Kraken and BTC-E (for the BTCEUR pair), and BTER and Cryptsy (for BTCXDG). Switching between data sources (from the Settings menu) is now much faster and smoother (no page refresh). Also, you can now easily reset the data sources in the Settings menu.
More to come. As always, thanks for your support.
@_date: 2014-02-12 07:19:52

You're right that this linked article didn't show MasterCard paying any politicians directly.
My point was a semantic one: as far as I can tell, and in my opinion, 'petition' has a narrower meaning than 'lobby'. To petition is to seek to influence *through words alone*; to lobby is to seek influence more generally, perhaps through campaign contributions, etc.

@_date: 2014-06-17 16:04:53
I've been thinking a bit about this problem. Not in the context of Bitcoin necessarily, but in some hypothetical decentralized network.
Proximity (i.e. distance with an *upper bound*) is provable via latency, due to the speed of light. If you send a node a challenge (e.g. some work), you can calculate a *maximum* distance between you and that node using the latency of their answer. In order to prevent shenanigans (e.g. deliberate widening of that maximum distance) nodes should be somehow incentivized to respond as quickly as possible.
I wonder if there's some way to combine that with a decentralized network where nodes report to each other the proximity of nodes around them, in order to come to a consensus on a collective geographical map of the network, and in turn to distribute work geograpically. Perhaps rewards could be proportional to how far away from your nearest node the network judges you to be.
There's probably some fatal flaw in the idea, but I find it interesting to think about anyway :-)

Something tells me their policy exists regardless of their opinions of said governments' censorship laws etc. My guess is their aversion to Bitcoin is due to perceived legal risk, whereas government-backed currencies carry less (perceived) legal risk.
That being said, Erik makes a good point about them never needing to handle the coins. (Maybe the anonymity is the problem?) However, I agree they should toughen up and follow in WordPress's footsteps.

I like the idea, but most people have no idea what algorithmic means.
Why not just 'electronic money'? People are already familiar with the mental shift from 'mail' to 'email'. I reckon they will instantly understand 'emoney' (in the most basic sense).

I recommend an approach like [BitPiggy]( which is not a full-fledged exchange (they don't store money), but provides the simplest and most convenient way for people to buy and sell bitcoins (only in Australia).
I think that is what's needed most; a service like BitPiggy should be available in every country.
Anyway, if you *must* create an actual exchange, I think you should spend a few months researching first. It's a pretty serious undertaking (if you want to do it properly).

Whether or not you end up supporting Bitcoin, thanks for keeping an open mind!
As others have mentioned, I can't see how you'd mitigate the risk of chargebacks if you provide next-day Bitcoin payouts. You'd essentially be in a similar position to businesses that allow people to buy bitcoins via credit card (high risk for the seller). I guess you could charge more for BTC payouts..
It's a shame traditional payment systems and Bitcoin are so incompatible. It didn't need to turn out that way. (I'm *not* suggesting Bitcoin should've been designed to be reversible, but that there could've been a non-reversible prior payment method.)
@_date: 2012-08-20 08:33:10

Agreed, some have, but *not* the ECB. If there have been noteworthy accusations by others, fine, as you say it might be fair to mention them.

**TL;DW**: Tony Gallippi, cofounder of [BitPay]( outlines the major business cases for Bitcoin, current and future: Identity theft elimination, fraud reduction (credit card fraud currently costs businesses 100B USD per annum), lower fees for merchants, truly global payments (unlike credit card processors that block certain countries), and cheap international transfers. He also shows a projected adoption curve for Bitcoin: Innovators (mainly young male computer geeks; where we are now), Early Adopters (international businesspeople; those familiar with international currency exchange), Early Majority (avid internet shoppers), Late Majority, and Laggards. Interesting side notes: BitPay now has over 2,000 registered merchants, after having *doubled in the last 3 months*. (Mostly from memory, let me know if I've missed any points.)

That's a whole lot of conjecture with absolutely zero reasoning.
To be clear, I neither agree nor disagree with you. I'm not knowledgeable enough about economics to have a firm opinion on this deflation 'problem'. However, I *hate* it when people preach a particular viewpoint like you've done here, without bothering to back up their assertion in any way. Nebulously citing Krugman and "~~collage~~" college doesn't count.
I'm hoping that someday, someone will be kind enough to ELI5 why (they think) deflation is such a bad thing.

Mining isn't the only option. You could try working for bitcoins (freelance work etc) or selling stuff online. The options are limitless.

The two other lines represent the cumulative bid (orange) and ask (blue) volumes for each price point. Basically, they tell you how much you'd need to spend to move the price to any given point.
For example, at the time the above image was captured, you'd need to have *sold* about 20k bitcoins to move the price to $11. Conversely, you'd need to have *bought* about $390k worth of bitcoins to move the price to $13.
Often, these bid and ask lines form steep segments that look like walls. Walls usually form around 'round' prices e.g. $11 or $12, but in this image the best example of one is at about $12.80.
@_date: 2012-01-03 09:17:24
I'm assuming you're referring to Bitcoin's non-reversibility.
There may be (and probably will be) payment processors built on top of Bitcoin that offer this kind of protection.
Payment reversals are not the only way to combat fraud. There's escrow. Or insurance to cover consumers against fraud. There are probably more alternatives I haven't considered.
It doesn't make sense to build reversibility into the currency itself; just like you can't reverse a cash transaction (without the other party's consent).

Agreed. They *have* $13k worth of BTC.


It does matter. From that piece of information *alone*, it's inaccurate to say they received $13k worth of donations. What really happened is:
1. They received 1000 BTC.
2. Then, by keeping the coins – deliberately or not – they took a long position on BTC.
In other words, the fact they have $13k worth of bitcoins is primarily due to their market position, and only indirectly due to donations.

Since BIP 21 has apparently been confirmed, now seems like a good time to start discussing this.

@_date: 2012-02-13 10:41:05
I'm not so sure.
Bitcoin eliminates (the *need* for) middle-men. Therefore, merchants will always be able to accept your coins directly, albeit with a little extra effort. That is not even remotely possible with traditional money (over the Internet).
I think that kind of environment will promote competition amongst payment processors, and therefore lower fees.

Okay, those are some fair points. I wasn't disagreeing; just wanting to see evidence.
In regards to Bitmarket, the auctions sites you mentioned, and BitMunchies etc, I think it's worth remembering that most startups (regardless of currency) fail. These failures do not necessarily indicate that others are struggling.
I generally don't pay much attention to online surveys, and especially in this case. The survey was run on a site devoted to speculation (Bitcoin *Trader*), which might distort the results. However, I don't doubt for a second that a significant proportion of the community engages in speculation or hoarding (exactly how much I have no idea).
The number of transactions is an interesting one. It has grown greatly over the past year, but how much due to speculation, and how much due to general trade is anyone's guess.
I think you'll find that most Bitcoin stats are very hard to interpret, and will be until someone does deeper analysis (like separating the number of exchange transactions from other transactions).
In my opinion, the best figure to track is the number of businesses currently accepting Bitcoin. This gives the best indication of the *usefulness* of Bitcoin, but isn't necessarily a clear indicator of the health of the Bitcoin economy.

With conversion time, I assume you're referring the time it takes to go from normal currency (e.g. in your bank) to BTC.
It's a good point that people need to be aware of. The way I see it, I already *have* money in an exchange (either in BTC or USD) or another wallet, ready for me to use. In other words, as long as you keep your exchange account 'full', it should only be a problem when you first decide to jump in.

It's been a while since my last update, but hopefully the next one will be sooner.
**Summary**: you can now convert to and from 64 currencies, as well as 4 precious metals (gold, silver, platinum, palladium). In many cases you can type the name of a country or territory to find a currency (e.g. "England" will yield GBP). Each currency has it's own URL now, which means that instead of having to select your preferred currency each time, you can simply bookmark it.
There are many more improvements I plan to make, including optional volume-weighted prices (period yet to be determined), more currencies, better mobile support, etc. Edit: and a widget to put on other sites!

It's not that simple. The only fair way to calculate a dollar figure is to convert each transaction at the time it occurs. (Which would require some programming. Maybe BlockChain would like to implement this?)
For example, there might've been 1,000 BTC donated when the price was $2. Those coins shouldn't now be valued at the current rate – $13.50 – especially since they might've been spent when they were received.
@_date: 2012-12-10 09:22:33
Do you mean how anyone would be able to short *enough* BTC to make the attack worthwhile? Now that I think about it, it's probably too difficult/expensive. They would need to borrow tens of millions of dollars worth of BTC, which is no small feat in itself.
@_date: 2012-11-12 08:21:10


Yeah, that is more accurate.


Agreed (for individuals at least), but perhaps there's room for a reputable business that specializes in delivery. After all, people have strangers (employees of delivery companies) deliver things to them all the time.
It could be a more convenient alternative to services like BitInstant (yet more expensive); rather than going to the bank or 7-11, you just order online, specifying your preferred delivery time.

I understand that they need to make money.
When merchants are considering accepting Bitcoin, I imagine one of the things that might convince them is lower fees (maybe saving 1-2% on each transaction). However, if the fees are roughly the same, and there aren't many people demanding they accept Bitcoin, they will likely ignore it.
Also, the average merchant (cheapskate or not) isn't going to code their own solution.

I feel like people are far more open to the idea of Bitcoin than they were, say, a year ago. Back then, any mention would bring out the haters: "It fell from $32 to $2...", "Bitcoin has been hacked..." etc.

I think it will be analogous to gold before fiat currencies became the norm; finite supply, which led people use it as a store of wealth ('hoard'), but didn't stop them from spending on things they wanted.
Whenever the hoarding issue is raised, it always seems to me like another way of talking about savings. Most people set aside a proportion of their wealth to spend later, regardless of which currency they're using. That doesn't necessarily mean they'll buy fewer things.

How does it leak less info?
Are you referring to the fact that someone could see that the money went to GrubGo (and could therefore learn about your spending habits, if they could identify your wallet address)?
If they used a new address per transaction, how would they aggregate their money to then spend it? Would aggregation undo the benefit of using unique addresses?
I'm pretty ignorant about privacy in relation to Bitcoin, but I'm trying to learn more.
@_date: 2012-01-02 06:35:45
Consider using [cash deposits]( (e.g into Mt Gox). Much faster than depositing into Dwolla (and I can't see any mention of fees).
Withdrawing probably requires a different strategy. Don't forget you can raise your withdrawal limit (above $1,000) at Mt Gox.

I'm a big fan of Ƀ. I like the fact that it's unambiguous, unlike ฿, which conflicts with the Thai Baht. Some argue it doesn't matter; many currencies use $, which is true, but I don't think it's a good reason to follow suit. Also, I prefer how Ƀ looks (subjective, sure).
On the downside, there seems to be a lack of fonts that support Ƀ, unfortunately. And, the majority seems to be against it, so it looks like we're going with ฿ for now.

Interesting choice of example. The electronics you mention are extremely price-deflationary. And yet, the computer industry is a shining example innovation, not to mention investment.
Please, tell me, why do investors in this industry not shy away simply because of falling prices? Similarly, why do people not 'hoard' their money instead of buying consumer electronics? Considering they know they can get more *and* better electronics next year for the same number of dollars. Yet they still buy their tablets and their plasmas in droves.

I wonder if therein lies the solution: increase the block size in line with decreases in price/capacity (and price/performance) of storage devices. Eventually, although it may take decades, there will be a point where even a hobbyist can cheaply handle any amount transactions that Earthlings throw at them. That's assuming the demand for transactions eventually plateaus; once most of the world is using Bitcoin.


By the way, I'm not very familiar with Ripple – what makes it a good fit as a 'side protocol'?

Sure, I understand it might be difficult, but the quote is that "Bitcoin can't be banned outright". I understand that Bitcoin can be seen as a *form* of speech, or a *form* of maths, but it's a big stretch to say that the government can't, or won't ban this particular form.
Believe it or not, there are forms of speech that are already illegal – see hate speech for example. I won't get into the debate over the validity of such bans, I'm just saying it's possible.
EDIT – It just occurred to me that hate speech may not be strictly illegal in the US, unlike many other 'free' countries. However, there are apparently other forms of banned speech in the US, according to Wikipedia: "obscenity, defamation, incitement to riot, and fighting words".

For those of you who have no idea what SSL is, it's important to know that this issue affects *everyone*.
Whenever you use a secure site on the web (e.g. banking, email etc.), the technology that is normally used to secure your connection is SSL (or similar).
The problem is that SSL relies on a number of companies (about 650), called Certificate Authorities. A breach (e.g. hack, coercion) of *any one* of these companies can compromize the security of millions of web users.
Convergence aims to solve that problem.

I think you're partly right, and I upvoted you.
Bitcoin will not solve their problem *now*. However, it is a potential solution to this problem (and many others) in the long term.
Bitcoin needs more supporters in order to have any real impact. Yet almost any mention of Bitcoin on sites like Reddit gets shot down because it won't solve people's problems *right now*.
I think that's what this thread's source of frustration is.
@_date: 2011-10-20 06:02:21


True. I wonder if there are any merchant tools that do this.

As far as I can tell, they aren't exactly trustworthy.
See [this]( [this]( and [this](
Long story short: Dwolla claimed transactions in their system weren't reversible, TradeHill trusted them, scammers started reversing payments, Dwolla quickly changed their terms of service (to no longer claim payments weren't reversible), and made TradeHill foot the bill (tens of thousands of dollars).
BTW, TradeHill is another exchange (like Gox).

All fair points, except that you don't need to expose yourself to exchange rate fluctuations. Store some money in an exchange, then buy bitcoins when you need them.
Soon, it'll get much easier to avoid exchange rate risk. Wallet services will provide a way to *automatically* convert from fiat (USD etc.) to BTC when you make purchases.
@_date: 2011-12-21 04:19:41

I'm still learning Ripple, but I'll try to answer your questions.


Yes, but with a caveat: you're not technically sending bitcoins, but *credits* for bitcoins. For example, think of it like sending Mt Gox coupon codes; they're not technically bitcoins, but they're worth roughly the same (providing you trust Mt Gox).


Not sure which company you're referring to here, but if you mean OpenCoin, they are not the ones with whom you would be entrusting your BTC (they only manage XRP, a currency within Ripple). However, you would be entrusting your BTC to a gateway (or gateways) of your choice, who store your BTC for you and allow you to trade on the Ripple network.


Yep. Every time you make a transaction on Ripple that you would otherwise make in the block chain, you are effectively reducing load on block chain. (And, you might say, helping Bitcoin scale.)
@_date: 2013-10-14 17:53:10
I think so. They do volume-weighting, but I'm not sure on the specifics.
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:06:30
You mean get money into Ripple? Send it to a gateway (e.g. Bitstamp), then 'Withdraw to Ripple'. Boom, got funds in Ripple.
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:32:05
I can understand why you'd think that, but believe me there is. If you were relying on any one of MtGox's APIs, you'd know what I mean.
@_date: 2013-01-24 08:38:45


I'd love to know more about this bit; I only have a vague idea of how it might work. Could you please give an example?

Impressive proselytism as usual, mayor!
@_date: 2013-03-16 20:22:19
I think I understand your line of thought, and I find it very intriguing. A corollary would be that all acts could be considered as either:
(a) directly selfish, or
(b) indirectly selfish.
In order words:
(a) pursuing your interests by directly benefitting yourself, or
(b) pursuing your interests via benefitting others (what people generally refer to as 'selflessness').

The difference, I believe, is the 7-day average. The $32 price didn't last long.
Edit: [Here]( a graph that shows the 7-day periods to and from the (intraday) $32 peak. There were two days that reached over $30, and no single day started or finished over $30.

I really like that anecdote. However, there's one advantage that being an early Bitcoin adopter has over being an early shareholder in a company: your share of the Bitcoin pie (21M coins) won't be diluted. If Ronald Wayne had held on to his Apple shares until today, he would no longer own 10% of the company due to several rounds of angel and VC investment, as well as stock issued to employees as incentives etc.
@_date: 2013-05-02 13:42:40

@_date: 2013-01-10 21:54:42
Interesting. That might be a way to get 'BTC' recognized by standards organizations, instead of the more standards-compliant 'XBC'. I'm not sure which I prefer.
@_date: 2013-02-23 05:51:12


Okay, I see your point.


I believe this is one of the problems Ripple is trying to solve — or at least, minimize. Ripple is itself (among other things) a distributed currency exchange. Ripple relies on gateways to allow money to flow into the network, just like Bitcoin relies on exchanges such as Mt Gox. Think of gateways as exchanges without the trading function; they simply store funds on your behalf (which allows you to then conduct trades within Ripple). My point is that there is a much lower barrier to entry in starting a gateway as compared to an exchange; you don't need to develop complex exchange functionality (and there are potentially fewer legal obstacles, though IANAL). Additionally, once you as a user have funded your gateway account, you then gain access to the funds of other gateways via Ripple's trading function, reducing the incentive to e.g. "choose Mt Gox because it has the most volume". Therefore, I anticipate much greater competition in the gateway market, which I hope will in turn benefit Bitcoin by reducing its dependence on large exchanges.


Similar to in Bitcoin: don't entrust your money with untrustworthy entities, which includes pseudonymous ones, and those who extend trust to other untrustworthy entities.

I think what mungojelly is referring to, albeit in a pretty uncivilized way, is that established participants in heavily regulated industries can benefit from such regulation, due to the high barrier to entry it poses to new participants, thereby reducing competition.

We are 19 days past the start of the recent crash, and the price is currently 141 USD, or approximately 53% of the $266 dollar peak. Interestingly, 19 days after the start of the June 2011 crash, the price was roughly 17 USD, or approximately 53% of the $32 peak. (For those who don't know their Bitcoin history, the price then gradually fell to 2 USD.)
I'm not making any predictions here, but I agree it's premature to say we've levelled out, given such a parallel to the last bubble.

True, you could argue (and I would) that PayPal had an easier job on their hands than creating a currency, and a new *kind* of currency at that.
In the early stages, PayPal had way more resources at its disposal: several wealthy founders who could dedicate their time to the project, as well as venture capital backing. Bitcoin had neither of these luxuries, which I think more than makes up the 10-fold difference at this point.

This is one of the reasons I see Bitcoin as so revolutionary. Having greater control over your money allows you to do things like: minimize the risk of losing money if a site gets hacked (by withdrawing when not in use), or simply use that money for other things at the drop of a hat.
Makes me think of traditional online gambling sites, where withdrawals can take *weeks* (e.g. checks), and in some cases they won't let you withdraw small amounts of money. With Bitcoin there is no reason nor excuse to have these delays and limitations, as sites like bitZino have shown.

As much as I like this idea, I'm not sure "bitcoin:" is the best term to use. Sure, Bitcoin is the leading cryptocurrency at the moment, but what happens in future if there are multiple widely used cryptocurrencies? That will require the approval of a new URI scheme for each: "litecoin:", "ripple:".
Wouldn't a more future-proof solution be to just use "pay:" (or "payto:"), and allow the payment protocol to be specified as a paramater (if unspecified could default to user's preferred one)? After all, for mail we don't have "smtp:", we have "mailto"; no protocol specified.
I'd be interested to hear other opinions on this. Am I missing something?

Sure, if you're happy to accept *extremely* old data. At some points over the last week, Gox's HTTP API has been returning &gt;30-minute-old data (this was the same on their site, so crawling is out).
Now, they happen to have two other APIs: plain websocket, and Socket.IO. Both frequently disconnect, and are sometimes inexplicably silent or unavailable. In some instances, only one or two of the APIs is even *remotely* up-to-date (sometimes none of them are).
You can of course code around all this mess; but that goes back to my original point: it requires maintenance to keep it all ticking along (somewhat) smoothly.
@_date: 2013-02-23 05:23:28


Yes, that's true. However, I don't think the normal use case will be quite like that. People wanting to use Ripple will likely begin by depositing some funds at a gateway (that they trust). For example, if you deposit 1BTC at Bitstamp, they will (after 6 confirmations) extend trust to you of 1BTC in Ripple. Then, you can use that trust to make payments to (i.e. trade with) anyone who trusts Bitstamp (and has a Ripple account). Bear in mind, in the early days I think Ripple will be used almost exclusively for currency trading; after all, it's designed to be a distributed exchange. Eventually, if it becomes popular enough, people might begin using it to pay for goods and services. (In summary, I think the person-to-person trust links will be dwarfed by trading involving gateway credits.)


That's a legitimate concern. All I can say is that it's up to you to carefully choose those whom you trust to *not* overextend credit to untrustworthy entities. Perhaps you can mitigate your risk by 'cashing out' (i.e. withdrawing funds from a gateway) when you have no intention to make trades for a while.

To give you a rough idea, Confinity (which merged with X.com to form PayPal) was founded in December 1998. PayPal was acquired for $1.5B in October 2002.
So it took PayPal almost 4 years to reach a $1.5B valuation, and after just over 4 years Bitcoin has reached $150M. On a logarithmic scale, the two are pretty close.

I wouldn't say that's what Ripple *is*, but it certainly allows you to accept/create/trade such 'certificates' (denominated in any currency).

Whichever phrase is used, I think it should focus on the freedom that is inherent in Bitcoin, since that seems like a good way to motivate people over the initial steep learning curve, and difficulty of acquisition etc.
My initial thoughts were:
* Bitcoin: Monetary Freedom
* Bitcoin: The Money of the Free
That second one might appeal to the majority-American Reddit audience. (Or maybe it's too corny, I don't know.) Anyway, I'm sure someone more creative will be able to come up with a better freedom-centric slogan.

Preev uses the Bitstamp rate by default, because it's the largest exchange where the price isn't being skewed by withdrawal problems. Whether or not that's fair is a debatable (there is no one way to determine an exchange rate). However, I think it could be improved by using a weighted average across several exchanges (perhaps excluding Gox), which I'm planning to implement very soon.
@_date: 2013-03-30 00:38:43
You deposit your USD (or any currency) at a 'gateway'—an entity you trust to store your money. Currently, the largest Ripple gateway is [Bitstamp]( Once you've deposited money at a gateway, you make a 'withdrawal' from that gateway to the Ripple system; in effect this converts your deposit into what are called Ripple IOUs that can be traded for other currencies in the Ripple network.
In order to get your money out of Ripple, you simply do the reverse: make a deposit at the gateway in the form of your Ripple IOUs, and then you can withdraw your money from the gateway however you choose: via bank transfer, or as bitcoins, etc.
It's important to note that gateways are not necessarily Bitcoin exchanges (and vice versa). Bitsamp happens to be both, but it's entirely possible for a gateway to be just a gateway i.e. an entity that simply processes deposits (and withdrawals), and allows you to convert your deposits into IOUs that can be traded on the decentralized Ripple market.
It is a fairly difficult system to grasp (it took me a while). However, I think it has a lot to offer.
