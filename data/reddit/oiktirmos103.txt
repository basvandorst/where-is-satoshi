Right, so when a half a dozen members slander a company with no evidence thats ok. But when I support a company, and provide proof to back up my statements. I am a shill?
Makes a ton of sense.

no large company, on the planet, would make an "off the record" statment to a random person.

I guess that makes sense you highlight the things that support your claims, and downplay the ones that don't.
In reading through your writing, it does not seem they are actually doing anything wrong. Just seems like you don't like the way they do business?

this is was disproven a while ago. Here is a 3 million dollar order confirmed by the company that sold it. 
It does not make sense to try and pull a ponzi, but spend all the money on the right thing Its kind of against how a pozni works...

So now we are going to pretend scenario that makes them a ponzi. Not the one thats actually been documented. You guys are making more sense :)

they placed a fairly larger order recently and it was confirmed directly by bitmain

so just so we are all clear, coin fire access to the largest retailers in the world? And they just tell you things off the record about a mining company? That does not sound weird at all :)
