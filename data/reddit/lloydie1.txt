I think just the fact that people can make competing bids etc would be great as a first step. The payment stuff can be handled through reputation scores. One of the problems will be defective merchandise and dispute resolution etc.. I guess that's where BitInsurance will come in one day, a general pool of funds that keeps a decentralised reputation score of every merchant/consumer - anonymously of course.

The worst that could've happened is the draining of the hot wallet, which should be a small percentage of all of gox's Btc holdings. Moreover, they will be able to identify the fraudulent accounts and confiscate the btcs in those accounts. Furthermore, they can seek legal redress against those identified account holders. Gox just needs to announce their percentage holdings in hot versus cold wallets to reassure everyone. I can't understand why they haven't done this already.

The point is that during the Ponzi phase, borrowers are forced to borrow to fund interest and principal, which leads to destabilisation of the financial system.  Ergo: it is a ponzi because credit systems tend towards crisis.  
That is the whole point of Minsky's work.  And he has been more right than all the neo-classical/keynesian/monetarist clowns. He is the one that deserves a nobel prize in economics (yes I know it doesn't really exist).

The issue here is that Shiller was trained as a neo classical economist. When faced with something that is a new economic system, he can only label it with what he knows, which is to call it a bubble. However, technological adoption rates do not conform to general asset cycles. How can something with only 1 million users and virtually no leverage be a bubble? Even if it is bubble, with a growth rate of 20% per MONTH this new asset class has a long way to run before reaching 1% of the human population. Get on board before the value climbs further!

"There is absolutely no economic, financial or social value to the Bitcoin."
The above statement is absolutely incorrect. Bitcoin allows for the transfer of value between two parties without relying on a third party.
Never before have humans possessed the technological ability to verify transactions through an insecure open network without relying on intermediaries.
In other words, bitcoin is the first system of value transfer that does not require trust. This also means that bitcoin is the first real alternative people have ever had if they do not wish to rely on banks and payment processors to transfer wealth.
This technological advancement is highly valuable, more so than gold, in a technologically based society.

AFAICT: Charlie bought a marijuana brownie. He facilitated bitcoin sales for a reseller to stay under the AML limits. Some of the people who bought btcs may have used some of the btcs to buy legal and illegal stuff.  
Charlie may have technically violated the AML provisions re: the reseller but he is going to argue that the btcs were actually sold to unknown persons under the AML limits, where id is not required. The reseller was doing an "intro" only.
This is a grey area. Shrem was a shrewd businessman. He is also 24 and left an email trail.

I disagree. Bitcoins must be spent to receive economic benefits. In contrast, fiat is created out of thin air via central banking and fractional reserve banking. The debt inflates asset prices and preserves the wealth of the 1%, without them needing to spend their real wealth.
The wealthy then withdraw equity and capital gains from asset price increases to fund their lifestyles. The fiat system's gini coefficient is getting worse. Bitcoin's gini is improving. 
The Internet generation is only poor because of the effects of the fiat debt based system pushing up asset prices beyond the reach of this generation. When they find out what has happened, they will not be happy.

Simply means you won't need cash.  All you need is Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-16 05:40:52
In blockchain we should trust.

You just one eloquent dude, unlike me.
@_date: 2014-02-07 00:07:20
And surprise, surprise: fraud still happens despite FINRA regs.

However, would bitpay also know who was doing business with who?

They get killed, they die for awhile then they comeback stronger than ever!!!  You can't kill entrepreneurs.  Unless China wants to go back to pure communism. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 01:31:47
100% correct on this point.  This theory points to insolvent trading and jail time for Krapeles.

Please help bitcoin. Do not buy terribly expensive ghs from CEX.IO who own ghash.io. With humble thanks.
Put the above in your bitcointalk signature if you agree.
These are the most effective things you can do to reduce CEX.IO's influence.
@_date: 2014-01-09 08:58:51
Please don't buy ghs on CEX.io. It's too expensive and they are part of ghash.io. With humble thanks.

Quick, make sure you buy back those Bitcoins before that lovely Indian meal costs you 10 x the price in Swiss Francs!
@_date: 2014-01-31 13:43:22
Yeah, but do they touch the junk?
@_date: 2014-01-13 08:56:57
This means that Bitcoin will takeoff in China as Chinese people are huge risk takers.

Is David baffling all of us with BS?
@_date: 2014-01-29 00:53:23
It's the old versus the new for me. The regulator has no answers. The old money cartel is corrupt. A new monetary system is emerging. 
@_date: 2014-01-31 01:02:24
A "bit" extreme.
@_date: 2014-02-03 06:25:58
I checked the rate. It was about 1.4% in 2012, which means less than inflation.

On the contrary, FRB is a Ponzi scheme. Read Minsky. In the final credit phase, borrowers must borrow to cover principal and interest repayments. Minsky called it the Ponzi debt phase, which is where we are at now. When borrowers are not extended new credit, the credit bubble collapses.

Bitcoin is already global. The NY hearing is not about the legitimacy of Bitcoin, it is about whether NY and the US wants to be part of the decentralising revolution that is coming.

It doesn't have to be similarly valuable. It just needs to be valuable.

Ha. The Keynesian system is going down in a few months.

Full circle! We're back to "tally sticks"

You guys learnt nothing from the depression, the tech crash and the GFC. Credit is a dead end. In a few months we'll see who built their castle on sand. Ha. Enjoy circle jerking each other.

It is new bitcoiners buying ghs from CEX.io that is giving CEX so much power.

Does all the hash power of a pool reside behind one IP address?

WB doesn't like bitcoin because it potentially harms the banks that he has invested in.
@_date: 2014-01-25 02:23:17
Why should a bank have the right to ask you what you are doing with your money? Unless you actually like being doled out pocket money from your parents.
@_date: 2017-09-01 09:58:22
Heheheh. You lose!
@_date: 2017-05-06 09:58:14
Nodes are just wallets
@_date: 2017-05-10 23:58:41
How so? I can rent some linux boxes and create virtually unlimited wallets for very little cost.
@_date: 2017-05-06 11:04:31
It seems you missed the point. Wallets don't provide any security.
@_date: 2017-05-05 22:40:47
Let's lower the blocksize to 300 kbs!

Would be better if FYN allocated a fixed percentage of revenues to buyback FYN tokens rather 70% of net profits, which is a more ambiguous metric.

Bitcoins are a reliable store of value because when 21 million people all want 1 bitcoin each, they won't be able to get 1 bitcoin each. 
The chances of 21 million people wanting 1 bitcoin each in a world of over 7.5 billion people is exceedingly great because bitcoins allow people to give each other cash across borders without the "help" of banks.

If one is poor and needed fiat for survival, then btcs are not reliable. But if one already has too much fiat then btcs are going to be bloody reliable.
Something better could come along in which case I will convert some btcs and fiat to zerocoins. The other alt coins are a waste of time IMHO, as they don't offer anything significant.
The Btc network effect will be difficult to overcome.
