Divisibility etc. is not an intrinsic value.

You have to separate Intrinsic Value from Convenience.
For example a giant palace is worth $300 million but it's not convenient for putting it in your pocket.
However a $3 lighter is quite convenient for being put into the pocket.
So why isn't the lighter worth more? Because "convenience" is not the same thing as intrinsic value.
My point is, you are trying to pass off bitcoin's Conveniences as its intrinsic value. They are not.
And the reason you do this, is the shocking fact that bitcoin's intrinsic value is nill.

It strikes me as quite logical that a lack of Industrial use makes Digital Gold, well... not gold.

Everyone has $7000. You are not special in that regard. Call me when you have $400,000 in cash

But if bitcoin keeps declining then the networth also goes down.
So the best solution is to forget crypto and go back to the euro

You are making a Circular argument.
You have to state Why it is money.
Something like this will not work: "It is money because it's money."
If you owned 500 bitcoins in your drawer, how would you personally enjoy them yourself without giving them to others?
In no way. They are as good as Nothing.

OK so make a rolex out of digital gold

You are assuming that bitcoin has value, in which case it would be really cool to have it divisible and tranferable.
But in writing a proof that bitcoin has value, you can't assume that bitcoin has value, because that is supposed to be the conclusion of your proof, not its premise.

OK But the operating word is actually not Intrinsic, the operating word is Value.
Bread has value, for you can eat it, or throw stale bread at noisy car alarms.
But you haven't demonstrated the intrinsic Value of bitcoin. I don't blame you, for it has none.

With savvy investors like these on Reddit, $0 will be surprisingly high.

Why 2 and not 0.2
I mean it was already 20.0 and that turned out to be divisible by 10
