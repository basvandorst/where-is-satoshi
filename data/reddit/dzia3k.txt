Question: how can someone dump their bcash without revealing their owners

Fuck. I sold early in Kraken for 130$ thinking it would drop like concrete from an airliner :(

The weekly price in fiat is interesting for speculators but meaningless if you want to know what is the value of crypto currency. Are you interested in Bitcoin because it is now worth more dollars than yesterday and you hope this trend will continue or do you believe in the technology and why?

We are witnessing a closed market of the people who got their Bitcoin in exchanges prior to the fork, got credited BCH and are trading it. When BCH deposits are enabled I expect it to drop like a meteorite.

I would love to tell you but right now there is over a month of shipping delay in Europe and so i have to wait until mid August to get it, consider that aswell. Trezor is a good option if you want It sooner

Check your country's laws for selling bitcoin, in a lot of countries you are required to pay taxes for the profits you take from selling bitcoin, even if that money never leaves the exchange and that could be as high as 50 percent. Taxation generally does not apply if you keep the trades in cryptos and never go back to fiat but that is very risky imo, basically hodling is the safest recommendation.

Did Maxwell just avoid an expensive problem for segwit activation?

The number of transactions in BCC will not be nearly as high as those in bitcoin, at least after the initial dump, i imagine.
So How can they have 8mb blocks (every 10 minutes?)? What happens if almost no one is using it or everyone sells them? What are the blocks filled with? or is it UP TO 8 mb? 
And how does bitcoin manage to make a block every 10 minutes with varying usage? are there quicker blocks and slower blocks?
I also heard  that an increase in blocksize will make the blockchain size grow by a rate much higher the present 1mb, again how can this be if the traffic is low?

I'm confident that they will become very interested in learning about those things once the steady growth of Bitcoin makes us rich.

Make a bip39 encrypted passphrase for your recovery words and give that to your family. Put your 12-24 words in a bank safe or somewhere your family will find. Explain to them how this works and how to recover, the easiest way is a hardware wallet.

Follow the link in the article, it's 5 million not billion. It seems like a rather huge mistake, wtf bitcoinmagazine?
