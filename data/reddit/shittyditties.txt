It was a fun night!!!
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:56:45
By the way, for anyone listening, I fucked up!!!
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:55:44
I hear ya. Just glad I did this before it hit $3300 an hour later
@_date: 2017-09-21 02:13:43
I got a keep key actually and got my btc off of coinbase at long last

@_date: 2017-09-14 17:48:34
I got sick of telling people I think it would adjust and being told "then why don't you sell it now and buy back when it goes down?" And I started to see the logic.  I'm basically doubling down on my own predictions.
Practice what you preach.
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:47:13
I'm sure I will at some point but hoping to buy the dip this time without injecting more capital
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:52:19
Thanks. I kept 1 full coin just in case I'm wrong. Mitigating risk is for adults!!!!
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:24:00
Time will tell and thanks!!
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:00:30
It's just as insane as the price predictions on the high end. The differential is time
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:36:42
Well today makes yesterday look silly. But who knows about tomorrow!!
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:23:33
I hope so!!!
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:00:50
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:46:21
My plan was to always hold on but I'm trying a new strategy this time around, that's all

Sure, change the words with whatever you want. I'm not trying to piss anyone off by sharing my experience

I think it will drop further but how much I cannot say
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:09:50
I'm sorry someone pissed in your wheaties this morning but it wasn't I

@_date: 2017-09-20 17:42:32
I so need to do this
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:25:20
I didn't downvote you
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:59:52
This is the right move. I got slammed yesterday for making the same post about $3500. Hang on!!!

@_date: 2017-09-14 17:50:06
Well I definitely should've convinced myself 3 days ago
@_date: 2017-09-16 09:35:55
Yes we will be dead but the question remains. I've often wondered what does happen at that point. I'd love to hear an expert's prediction

I did say differential, but you're not wrong either

It would be great, imho.  I would be all in below 3k

I got the books but didn’t know they were giving away good stuff like a Trezor!
@_date: 2018-04-26 11:41:34
Were they giving these away somehow?
