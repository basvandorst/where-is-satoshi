The inconvenience of credit cards is real.
First of all, in many cases you need to comprovate your wealth and no problems with debits to get one.
Credit card also has spending limits. Seems good? Depends. If you have a good control of your money and the limit is low, it's clearly a disadvantage. Also they charge me just to having it activated.
From the security point, it's completely broken. You need to trust the merchant won't charge you beyond of the items you're purchasing. You also need to trust the merchant won't be negligent with the security and have the credit cards stolen by a hacker.
Still in the security part, the EMV system from the POS machines (also known as chip and PIN) is broken: 
Also, here in Brazil, the internet banking is a nightmare. They obligate you to install a program called G-Buster, which is very hard to uninstall and turns your system very slow and unstable.
And in the comments you'll find an employee from the company which develops the G-Buster, claiming the act of publishing instructions to remove that piece of shit is helping criminals.

I think it's a bad idea. This will keep the habit of visiting this sub. Also, a lot of interesting ongoing discussions can just be lost because of the moderation (also remember theymos is hiring more mods), so it's counterproductive. And a lot of people will be banned (or even worse, [shadowbans]( ). I think we should avoid the unnecessary angry because of bans.

And I don't think downvoting is against the spirit of Reddit. On the contrary, downvoting is part of the spirit of Reddit. Reddit structure is done to seeing in the top what people like and hide what people dislike. You can disagree, but in practice, this is how this works, unfortunately.
So, the issue is not about people downvoting in the mod comments. It's about the way how Redit works. Downvoting is a big tempation for humans in general (myself included). People tend to avoid situations of insatisfaction, and downvoting is a great way to do this. So, instead of saying people shouldn't downvote the mod posts, it would be much more efficient to change Reddit structure and remnoving downvote, or avoiding it to have an impact in the classification of the relevance of the post. Until that, people will keep the downvoting practices. Specially as in a way of protest. I downvoted too in a lot of staff posts in this subreddit to protest against the mod pratices and upvoted posts in favor of changing the mod practices.

This is a deception, although not a surprise.
Instead of admiting the errors, you just delete all the posts which appoint them during this day in this subreddit. And hire more moderators in order to enforce this.
What we can say? Well, just good luck. I don't have any hate against theymos or any other of the moderators although they insist in the errors which resulted in a lot of downvotes against them. But if you want to stay alone here, I think there's nothing more we can do. Move to alternate subreddits and let this subreddit alone (yeah, let's do a massive unsubscribe here! Go to and ). Time will show the lessons for the community and the moderators.

And don't forget to unsubscribe in this sub. Let theymos alone with his mods.
@_date: 2015-08-17 15:57:30
And now 27%. But don't expect changes because of this. They just don't care. Even if a massive unsubscribe starts to happen (although we should do it anyway).

This is not exactly new. "Canal do Otário" is accepting bitcoins since the last year. I donated some some satoshi ealier this week.

The Twitter is from Casa Rosada. Forgeting the decorum is very common. And this is really nothing compared to a case where they just published the flying tickets of a journalist who left Argentina after being the first to publish about the death of Alberto Nisman (a prosecutor who had serious accusation against the government).

Block chain explains...
Every block up to  500 coins.
Block  56 coins.

What you're describing already exists and works exactly how you want: the fiat currency managed by the current banking system.
In this sense, Bitcoin would be just the same already existent currency, and the difference would be just the name.
I think Bitcoin is not just evolution. It's revolution. You're just looking for an evolution which maintains the status quo. Bitcoin breaks this, and this sounds strange for you (and for a lot people).

Thanks for the corrrections. Unfortunately, the navigation at the "official" Darkcoin's block explorer is very painful.
Anyway, as we are at Bitcoin's subreddit (BTW, a bad place to promote other coins), this deserves a comparision with BTC: when a Bitcoin block generated more coins than expected, the devs fixed the bug and fixed the block (  ). At Darkcoin, they changed the entire rewards system and maintained the faulty blocks.

Some of those address are repeated. If my account is correct, the hacker stole around 830 BTC.

Congratulations!!! I'm from Mar del Plata too, but currently I live in Brazil.
If you would have the option to buy anything with bitcoins, what would you buy first?

This is interesting, the price is more closer from the parallel rate of the US dollar than the official one (1 USD = 8,6 ARS in the official market, and 1 USD = 13 ARS in the parallel market, if I remember well).
