Sure for things that have been developed we can. I mean all the 'we expect'/'in the future'/'should happen' assertions throughout the article.

But the mining reward halves every four years, so unless on chain transactions increase dramatically either fees will have to skyrocket (100x increase from today) or hashrate will drop.

This is good news. Bitcoin will need altruistic miners if Lightning takes off.

Imagine if we put all that time, effort and money into development, merchant adoption, etc
