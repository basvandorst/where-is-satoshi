As of right now, Bitcoin has the safest blockchain in the world. I would bet that a new fintech company would use Bitcoin's blockchain, given that safety is foremost essential to a financial company. Unless there's some major disadvantage to Bitcoin, like high fees, or else, you will probably see new companies using this blockchain since it's the oldest and most secure.
 TLDR- new fintech companies need security; Bitcoin is the most secure ATM

Most of the exchanges announced that BTU would be an alt coin and BTC (from Core) would remain BTC

Yes, you will have both coins after the fork.
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:09:19
Of course it's ok, before knowing you have to learn :)
So a hardfork is a disruption to the consensus on which Bitcoin software to use.
Bitcoin Core is the group that developed the software that is currently in place; Bitcoin Unlimited is the new (relative to Core) group of developers that disagrees with the way Core acts and codes and so is proposing an alternative software, Bitcoin Unlimited, BU. 
A hard fork is the moment when one new chain, in this case BU, goes live and starts recording transactions on a different blockchain than what Core software does. So one chain becomes two (fork) and for each chain there's one coin: BTC for Bitcoin Core and BTU for Bitcoin Unlimited.
As a hodler, I believe you should pay attention to this. I love Bitcoin, as most of the people here, but I'm pessimistic about this fork situation thingy. If the hardfork does happen then it will be a complete war where each side is going to dump the other side's coins (so, for example, after the fork, Bitcoin Core developers suddenly sell their lot of bitcoin stored in Bitcoin Unlimited blockchain to make the value of BTU go down) to make the sharpest price drop possible in order to ensure their rival's annihilation. This is just the worst case scenario but it's a damn bad one.
To sum it all up, to you as a hodler this could mean a great loss of value were the things to go in such a way since the prince would probably fall lower than current levels. If the hardfork happens in a climate of hostility nobody will profit and Bitcoin will be worst off.
Good Luck and have a good one.

Civil war between factions inside Bitcoin

Because there are many copies of the blockchain spreaded around the whole community. So even if you could change one copy of it, the rest of the community wouldn't recognize your altered chain as valid because it has less blocks, less proof of work. Afaik

If you have a paper backup I think you can create an account on Blockchain.info and upload the funds there. 
This is a blockchain.info explanation on how to upload the funds. Notice that if you have a paper backup with both keys you can just use that as a paper wallet (though you should have a backup on another place).
Good Luck

If you are not in a hurry it's going to be okay. I have a pending transaction since one day and a half too. It's going to take some time but it's going to be fine. You can check the status of the mempool to get an idea when it will go through here:

Statistically yes but you can never be sure. Like it was said invest only what you can afford to lose, whatever doesn't make lose too much sleep at night. 
I think you should consider spreading out your investment over time in case it goes down (the price usually varies in cicles, overall always going up). If you want to invest those 20k, you could for example buy 2k each week over 10 weeks. This is called dollar cost averaging.
Also for this amount of investment, you might as well buy a hardware wallet. It is a usb device that you use to store the private keys (the keys that give you property over that btc). The advantage of this is safety, hardware wallets are impossible to hack via internet so you can be sure that your funds are safe from hackers and such.
Anyway, most of all, try to learn a little bit about bitcoin so you have a general understanding of how the network works. 
Welcome and good luck!

It's the weekend bru, it's frequent the price goes down on Friday because people close their positions until Monday. If I am right you'll see a rise on monday/ tuesday

The price is the news. Until some steps in there's probably not going to happen much.
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:53:21
I have this question too
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:51:06
Kraken offers both. Number 1 is buying btc and owning it.
Number 2 is just a leveraged position, kraken lends you btc for you to trade. If you don't choose any leverage when you are placing the order, you are really buying btc

I'm sort of feeling it too I guess. Let's wait and see...

This means that there are lot of transactions waiting to be included in a block. It happens frequently. See the 30 day window.

For them to be able to do that easily, they would need that there are no existing orders to be bought at several different prices (which in Bitcoin there are and a lot). If they tried to do that they would have to spend enormous sums because they have to buy all the existing orders up to the price they want and only then they could exchange the sum you spoke about. The liquidity in a market (i.e. the amount of btc you can buy before the price goes up ) is a good indicator of the robustness of a market to said manipulation.
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:38:23
yes. go to  , graph in the bottom
see the values below and then point to the red line to see how much you need to spend to raise the price

a paper wallet is, like any wallet, a combination of a bitcoin address and a private key that you can print on a physical piece of paper. You can generate paper wallets at bitaddress.org. 
Basically the advantage is that it's a physical object, not subject to hacking (as long as you take some precautions while generating the wallets, the most important one being offline while doing it; you just download a version of the website (check the "!" signal in the bottom left corner of the page).
To spend it you just need to go to blockchain.info and add the public address and scan the private key. I recommend paper wallets. Good luck
