Maybe there is no guy who use some uncool stuff before this stuff became a cool thing? I mean that there are no non-mainstream activites nowadays
@_date: 2014-10-04 15:04:53
That's a rule? 
@_date: 2014-08-06 07:47:58
Maybe they will call it like "British Bitcoins"
@_date: 2014-08-24 11:08:37
[Even a man with a stick can be called well-armed](
@_date: 2014-10-04 15:05:39
Seems that you know what are you doing.
@_date: 2014-09-06 11:11:07
Sure. Something like Satoshi Comstock 
@_date: 2014-10-05 04:28:29
Yes it is! Devs are so cool! 
@_date: 2014-09-28 04:54:52
Who cares? 
@_date: 2014-09-06 11:23:39


Lol sounds like he doesn't a painter 
@_date: 2014-10-04 15:05:06
Nice building
@_date: 2014-08-24 11:55:01
Sounds like a greatest spam under the quite good headline 
@_date: 2014-08-08 11:10:16
The article said nothing about this currency being a "crypto" currency, it just said it is a "digital" currency. So it is centralised and regulated, may not have a blockchain at all.
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:08:28
Right. It should work. 
@_date: 2014-09-28 04:54:24
To pieces. 
@_date: 2014-08-24 11:55:03
Yeah, this point is far from reality but if there will be no such articles, who will believe in Bitcoin power? 
@_date: 2014-08-18 02:29:05
No idea what he tried to do but now he sounds important and i believe him
@_date: 2014-09-28 04:57:28
That means that we will see more of this stuff on ESPN
@_date: 2014-10-04 15:05:47
Our armory contain a great armor lol
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:08:15
Canada? Seriously? 
@_date: 2014-08-18 02:17:24
Or the best one. At least we are know that they are scams
@_date: 2014-08-24 11:08:40
What is wrong with a phrase "wake up"?
@_date: 2014-09-06 11:34:29
You can cook for yourself 
@_date: 2014-09-28 04:56:52
Lol man it's so funny to realize that
@_date: 2014-08-18 02:28:35
Deleting comments is weird. 
@_date: 2014-09-28 05:02:54
So good for you. 
@_date: 2014-08-18 02:29:34
Lol. One step more and you will suggest forgivenes? Nah, we don't need it
@_date: 2014-08-06 07:48:31
Pretty sure that this isn't possible but your dream is nice. To the Moon! 
@_date: 2014-08-18 02:20:50
That's because censorship sucks
@_date: 2014-08-06 07:47:27
Flow of innovation, which is not controlled by somebody, could be dangerous
@_date: 2014-09-06 11:10:37
Need. To. Install. Fallout New Vegas. 
@_date: 2014-09-28 04:57:29
Seems that it is some sort of mainstream. 
@_date: 2014-08-08 11:10:20
 It is nothing similar to Bitcoin at all. Ecuador is borrowing Bitcoin's publicity.
@_date: 2014-08-18 02:17:05
That's an obvious but the fact that it's crafted is outrageous
@_date: 2014-08-06 07:50:38
It's not a bad idea to create a new wallet but importing your private key... 
Well, maybe you will meet some problems later
@_date: 2014-08-18 02:21:35
No it won't. There is no reason to make Coindesk legal 
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:08:05
Europe? Didn't hear this pefore
@_date: 2014-08-24 11:08:41
What a lovely diagram. Thx you for it. I'm about to show it to my friends. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 15:05:45
yiss? 
@_date: 2014-09-06 11:23:08
That wasn't a mystery of course if you don't know how to use google
@_date: 2014-08-18 02:23:16
Would you tell us what zsh is? Some sort of strange command line? 
@_date: 2014-09-06 11:35:05
Does this house built on the Moon surface? 
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:08:30


It's actually a big problem. 
@_date: 2014-09-28 05:03:36
HL3 confirmed.
@_date: 2014-08-24 11:47:15
Are you not? 
@_date: 2014-09-28 05:04:11


It's very dificult to so so many people to read the original papers. 
@_date: 2014-09-28 04:54:37
And can we guess what will be the 12? 
@_date: 2014-09-06 11:34:38
Wanna join it? 
@_date: 2014-09-28 05:02:41


That's why you are a Bitcoin user.
@_date: 2014-08-24 11:46:56
Everyone is happy. Believe me, dude
@_date: 2014-09-28 04:55:29


You should get deeper man
@_date: 2014-10-05 04:29:39
Or more, if you have a large sum of money in your pocket. 
@_date: 2014-08-18 02:20:33
I think that everyone who posted a comment here unfollowed them on twitter
@_date: 2014-10-05 04:29:12


Oh, that's easy. Just call your seller back.
@_date: 2014-08-06 07:46:13
That's because there is no George Osborne. Am I right? 
@_date: 2014-10-05 04:29:14
Since now I want a Win10 + Open Bazaar New UI lol
@_date: 2014-08-18 02:25:04
Maybe we could work our way around it! 
@_date: 2014-08-24 11:46:44
Who know how next generation of core will change BTC? 
@_date: 2014-08-18 02:30:56


That is the reason why they deleted their posts. But i also hope that situation will change in a few days and everyone will be happy

I love Bitcoin comics.
@_date: 2014-09-28 05:04:09
Yep. Can't understand why people are so angry? 
@_date: 2014-08-24 11:47:48
People who are already in deal (or know how Bitcoin works don't like when somebody try to wake them up)
@_date: 2014-10-05 04:29:22


Done. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 04:28:15
What a miracle! 
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:07:35
Shifting. You can feel it. 
@_date: 2014-09-06 11:35:59


Even if you are think that their are scammy or whatever people still using that. People are believe in their magic. 
@_date: 2014-08-08 11:09:25
Thanks for sharing I was truly waiting for that moment!  :-)
Great job again!! Thanks!!
@_date: 2014-08-04 15:46:51
Agree and I saw this video more than three times here.
@_date: 2014-08-18 02:30:10
Yes we are. But the freedom of speech is here, in the BTC subreddit. The Coindesk is not a Bitcoin subreddit, dude
@_date: 2014-09-28 04:56:08
ESPN made me laugh 
@_date: 2014-09-28 04:57:57
Do we know who he is? 
@_date: 2014-08-18 02:17:40
Because since know no one will use a coindesk?
