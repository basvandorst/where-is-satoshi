dude, if you could totally hook it up i lost hundreds of btc... verge of breakdown 
@_date: 2018-01-05 07:28:29
they are thai?
edit: will be interesting to see how this turns out
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:36:15
i would have sold half at the first red daily candle on this bubble... but i shorted with 10x way to early and lost everything.. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:51:42
if it makes you feel any better i shorted btc at 9400 and lost about the same, still not gonna nek myself over it.. you'll make it again

This is exactly why I grabbed 5M of doge today, I would say within the next 30-60 days it will pass LTC. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 08:43:31
will do
@_date: 2014-01-05 02:34:58
netflix will do anything to re-gain the customers it lost in the past couple years
@_date: 2017-01-06 21:39:01
at current price, but in a year or two it can be a ton
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:05:22
so you buy high sell low too i see
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:18:20
its going much lower 
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:06:02
exactly, im just waiting to go all in when we actually hit another support level and wait it out from there then not sure when i would sell 
@_date: 2019-01-29 18:42:08
take that out in btc and just move it to a wallet, no reason to even sell now price will pop again for sure, market makers will have to rekt the big shorters eventually
@_date: 2018-11-05 14:28:42
did you screenshot the posts or ads? share them here if you did
@_date: 2013-05-01 18:40:37
don't worry, i am in a few at 161 and spent some on nice products at 150, just hold and buy again now at the floor and just wait it out..
@_date: 2013-08-20 19:07:33
good luck to you, i would suggest trading your money vs. letting it just sit there, you can easily accumulate more bitcoins if you follow the waves..
source edit: started with 10k now have nearly the same as you.
@_date: 2013-04-26 17:03:06
also there's margin/leverage options on campbx, i'd explain but it's not clear to me either there.
@_date: 2013-05-26 16:54:51
it's fast, done now a few times. 
@_date: 2013-05-25 10:20:11
you'll need an edu visa or non o, i am in krabi i would give you some baht for btc but that's way far south..
edit: i found this  but you would need to send to her family's bank account..
@_date: 2013-06-02 10:14:56
i'd suggest you check out goxgui it's much easier to make trades with
@_date: 2013-05-14 04:44:02
If anyone is concerned about their security &amp; btc with MtGox, you can request them to change your withdrawal limit to "0" and nothing can be moved until you request this changed again later.. 
@_date: 2013-05-20 18:30:18
i'd imagine that coinbase will provide one for multiple platforms sooner or later, maybe they already have this going.
@_date: 2013-05-24 21:05:41
so if we bet 1btc we can receive 1.85 btc in return? 
@_date: 2013-05-20 18:14:06
you'll need to write a plugin or extension, have a dev follow bitpay and just change/test using API document from coinbase.
@_date: 2013-06-18 00:27:38
umm coinbase is just a 1% fee wired to your account, i would have only accepted btc and nothing else.. another reason this is a great solution to doing business with shady people like that..
@_date: 2013-05-07 02:20:02
i think that's a standard name, off the books trades.. keeps the market from going crazy with bigger guys..
@_date: 2013-05-21 07:19:18
that's about it for right now or use localbitcoins
@_date: 2013-05-07 02:04:43
possibly dark pool trades?
@_date: 2013-05-21 11:49:00
ok, timworstall, tim worst of all writers.
@_date: 2013-05-25 17:15:24
i guess it depends on the bank/bank manager/location.. 
@_date: 2013-05-18 11:00:23
did you have 2-factor enabled?
@_date: 2013-05-21 16:05:51
if you need some bitcoins let me know as long as things are not volatile i will help
