Network latency, among other things. The world wide web is as strong as its weakest links. Larger block sizes increase bandwidth (and storage) requirements for full nodes, and risk of orphaned blocks for miners.
The larger the block, the less people that can afford to mine or run full nodes. You are forcing miners and node operators to centralize around network hubs to remain viable in the bitcoin network.
Bitcoin is meant to be a global digital asset, a currency accessible to all. You can't maintain that title with a system which accomplishes its scaling via raising the minimum requirements to participate on the network. Especially when most people in the world do not have any choice over their network connection.

You spent a lot of time arguing against the fundamentals of Bitcoin, which is to be a *decentralized* digital currency. That is what makes it unique, not the transactions per second. Has the price risen to 16k+ per coin because people want another way to buy their coffee?
Your arguments make more of an effort to push a narrative than address the core concepts that make Bitcoin valuable. Which makes this conversation highly suspect.

This is such a big deal.
Now all those big firms on Wall Street, the ones you see books written and movies made out of, the real wolves.
Those wolves are wandering here now. ICO offerings turn into pushing penny stocks in the boiler room. It's the wild west. Hungry sharks in chatboxes, desperate to sell a ticket on a sinking ship.
Then there's thousands of backyard bitcoin millionaires who think candlesticks are meant for romance and tossing altcoins around Bitfinex without a fucking clue.
It's going to be a bloodbath. It's going to be glorious.

I am noticing a lot of different coincidental events that are merging into the perfect storm today.
* Difficulty adjustment incoming
* MSNBC promoting BCH
* Roger Ver saying he is going to dump his BTC
* Major futures markets opened Monday
* GDAX silently listing BCH on their exchange last night
* Massive pump/dump between BTC/BCH immediately follows
* Shooting star candlesticks all over the charts
* GDAX freezes BCH sell orders
* GDAX dumps 11K orders causing BCH to rocket over $9k per coin
* Other exchanges getting DDoSed with traffic
* Tons of BCH shills flooding into r/bitcoin spreading FUD
* Mempool getting spammed hard with tiny transactions
* Transactions costs being pushed to an ATH
* Blockchain.info going down
* A number of exchanges not processing withdrawal of BTC
* JPY  Finance Minister trashing BTC right on cue
* Major exchanges like GDAX still refusing to adopt segwit which would alleviate this mess.
Regardless, Bitcoin is holding strong and not suffering from too much of a dip. A lot of people are dumping BCH hard despite the inflated buy orders from Roger liquidating his BTC. There's also a lot of shenanigans going on with BCH price, as it's completely disproportional to BTC trade volume and decline. I think there's additional USD being pumped into BCH outside of BTC and altcoins being exchanged. Just look at the metrics between BTC/BCH and BCH/USD among other currency pairs and you'll see the manipulation going on.
Whatever, doesn't matter. Bitcoin's main fundamentals haven't changed. Just HODL while all this nonsense blows over. Maybe divest a small amount into altcoins for safe measure.

Wow that is a fake article. Andreas already commented on how they twisted his words for a headline. Why are you spreading it here?

No, because there's no proof *he* signed the message. He could simply be re-using a message that was signed previously, which is entirely possible since a couple of Satoshi's e-mail accounts were hacked.
It's like trying to prove you wrote a book by holding up a copy published 5 years ago. The only thing it proves is that you posses the copy. If you wanted to prove you wrote the book, then you would publish it with your name and signature.
