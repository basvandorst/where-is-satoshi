if you care to look at the charts and compare bitcoin on the same dip, they're pretty much in line - but bitcoin dropped from 19000 to 12000. That's a greater % dip.
Litecoin will steal a lot of bitcoin's market share as gateway currency for 2018. It's price is largely tethered to bitcoin but it has lower fees and faster transactions. It's readily available on fiat exchanges such as coinbase.
This makes it ideal as a cheaper, alternative gateway currency.

First off, Bitcoin has not even been around for 9 years yet.
Second: I'm not worshiping Litecoin, or any coin. I've invested in several coins which all have unique strengths. My majority is still in Bitcoin FYI, and will continue to be.
Thirdly: I am being logical. Very logical. I see Litecoin as having a very specific use-case: For being the intermediate currency for crypto investors to use when investing in newer or less-available currencies. There are several reasons for this:
1. Litecoin is an early fork of Bitcoin, and shares a lot of properties of Bitcoin. This makes it easy to use for people who are already familiar with Bitcoin. This also means there likely to be less 'nasty surprises' such as Exchanges disabling litecoin deposits/withdrawls like we see with a lot of newer, untested currencies. In short: Litecoin has the reliability and predictability of Bitcoin
2. Litecoin's price roughly tracks Bitcoin's price. This means that if an investor  wants to invest in obscure new crypto X, and they need to move funds on to an exchange which doesn't accept fiat deposits, Litecoin is a more attractive choice because: 1. It will cost less, 2. It will happen faster.
At the moment the bitcoin mempool is not too congested and 50-70 sat/byte transactions are going through. That's all fine and dandy, but when the markets kick off again the transaction fee is gonna shoot up again and we'll see all the complaining about high fees. Practically, this means if an average investor wants to move funds into an exhange, she/he will have to pay extortionate fees with BTC, or if they're clever, just use another currency. They have several choices, Ether, BCash, or (perhaps) Ripple and LTC. Of these, LTC is the safest bet, IMO.
Of course this is simply off-loading some of the traffic from the BTC network onto the LTC network, I'm not denying that, but simple economics tells me this is likely to happen. Of course I could be wrong. If you can find any flaws in my logic here, I'd love to hear them!

I can't argue with this.
People are normally broke after the holidays and the January paycheck seems to take forever. When people get paid their wages near the end of the month is when we'll see a rally.
It's also when smart institutional investors will jump on board. They don't want to trade against the market. These natural yearly cycles are very real, this is not a case of 'cherry-picking' statistics. If you compared a graph of ethereum to say retail sales of PS4 games (or something) they'd line up very closely.
I'd say it's optimistic to say $11,000 is the low. It could dip lower. TBH I'm happy that the market is doing this. It's obeying very natural cycles and is in a very healthy state.
I don't see any reason why 2018 won't be similar to 2017 in terms of money flowing into crypto.
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:00:58

The bitcoin fees issue has got to be sorted out. It's making bitcoin look like a joke. Especially to newcomers. A simple queueing system would do the trick.
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:23:16
It's also not indexable since all transactions are encrypted. This means even with a fully-synched node, for any new wallet, the entire blockchain needs to be scanned.
What Monero lacks in speed it makes up for in other areas, though - such as privacy. Monero is private, in fact it's spectacularly private. On top of that, it is actually used for e-commerce. Mainly dark markets. Like it or not, this is an important use-case and created natural demand. Just look at the price gains for 2017 - it has 33X'd in 2017.
Having some kind of lightning-style layer on top of the Monero blockchain would solve all it's scaling problems.
Long term, I think privacy coins will become the default, just like HTTPS is the default for web browsing. There's too much data-mining that can be done on unencrypted blockchains.

No. reversibility is a feature, and I do want it, but It's a missing feature, because it's not there. 
There's no reason why a transaction reversibility feature cannot be added to Bitcoin. Simply broadcast a "reverse transaction" message, digitally sign it with the key(s) that signed the transaction. Nodes can verify this with the public key from the transaction.
This is totally benign from an attackability point of view, because to broadcast a fradulent reversal, an attacker would need the private key of the transaction signer. Of course nodes wouldn't need to honor it and could ignore it if they want. But as long as most nodes are 'good', they will cancel any such transaction. Furthermore, they could store these in some kind of bloom filter so if the transaction is re-broadcast, it can be ignored.
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:43:22
hopefully there'll be a few blocks in quick succession. This should cut down the pool a but. I've got a tx in the 90-100 range... got a good feeling about it

I think he meant as hashpower goes up, the TX fee should go down,?
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:14:11
to be a double spend it would need to reference at least one of the same UTXOs.
This is the bit that confuses me. Why can't I just construct a new transaction which spends those same UTXOs but with a higher fee. Once this gets into a block the first transaction will be forever invalid. But I read that this doesn't work because most bitcoin nodes will ignore the second transaction. Not sure why though.
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:08:03
Exactly! I'm just learning this stuff now, because for the first time, I have a transaction stuck in the pool. Funny how you only learn about something when it affects *you*
I didn't know what replace-by-fee was until afterwards, and stupidly didn't use it. Yes. this would really drive down fees because people could first try with a low fee and if it's taking too long, bump up the fee slightly.
It's shocking how badly wallets handle this. This should all be done automatically and invisible to the user. Then there's coinbase- who just have a hard-coded MASSIVE fee that the user can't control and MUST pay... Gimme a break!
Another reason why I'll soon be closing my coinbase account.

Anybody I've no beef with coinbase (yet). My 0.25btc tx which took 2 hours wasn't pleasant though, esp with the mempool relatively low. All the waiting was for coinbase to broadcast the transaction.
But I do believe in having alternatives
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:26:12
I'm in a similar situation. Although I used 97sat/byte, so I'm hoping since it's Christmas it will be a lot less busy and the fee threshold will naturally drop.
I think I have no other choice but to wait. For you, you may have to contact a mining pool and pay them a fee to include your TX in a block. Otherwise you'll have to wait around 14 days until the network forgets about your transaction.
This is all to the best of my knowledge - I'm still learning 
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:14:50
They're both a few days old, so may be out of the mempool. You probably should re-broadcast it

You're actually wrong on one crucial point: the rules of the protocol say nothing about what transactions you can/should include in a block. It doesn't have to be the ones with the highest fees. 
A miner is free to choose whatever transactions he likes to be included in the block.
If the protocol did include some incentive for including long-waiting transactions it might be fairer.
Edit- there is no reversibility in the protocol either. The protocol has lots of room for improvement in this area.

I briefly owned some ETH but sold quickly.
The very fact that ETH has someone so significant at the helm that if, god forbid, he died, would likely rapidly destabilise the price, is in-itself a fatal weakness.
Not only that, he is also a significant stakeholder in the currency itself.
That's why I see LTC as a far more transparent and neutral project than ETH.

There's no security issues with NFC the technology.
There are security issues with NFC as implemented in bank cards and there being no indication on the card of the amount of money being transacted. It's easy enough for a malicious person to modify a Point\-of\-sale system with NFC to indicate that you're paying $1 then take $100.
Having the amount of money indicated on a device that's yours \(typically your phone\) eliminates this risk. This is how Lightning payments will work.

I watched a video of this clown talking about how bitcoin cash was better than the lightning network because bcc is connected in an almost 'full mesh' whereas in the LN you're connected to 5 or 6 people.
He seemed to be trying to convince people that for LN to be functional you needed to be directly connected to everybody otherwise you wouldn't have the latest blocks therefore your transaction somehow wouldn't work. Not only is he comparing two very different protocols with different requirements that are basically apples and oranges, but he also failed to point out that we've all been using a sparsely connected graph for over 20 years - the internet - and that seems to have worked out ok. The scary thing is he is an articulate and skilled liar and people will listen to him. He deliberately targets non-technical people with his bogus claims and shrouds it in half-truths then stamps it with the assurance that he has 5 phds and is indeed the inventor of bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-10-21 09:42:49
Good question - my understanding is lightning channels are funded by both parties, but the amount of BTC in a channel remains constant.
So if somebody sends you a large amount of BTC (like if you win big in roulette), all your immediate neighbours will get drained pretty fast, and those channels will need to close.
So let's say you have 5 btc, and you're connected to 5 other people, each of which has also contributed 1 btc to the channel, so in total there's 5 channels, each carrying 2 btc, giving you a theoretical maximum of 10 btc, 5 of which are already yours and 5 which are owned by your neighbours.
Let's say you spend 1 btc on roulette, that means one of your neighbours (let's say "Neighbour A") now owns all 2 btc on that channel, and you own 1 btc on the 4 other channels. Let's say you get lucky in your gambling game and win 5 BTC, (in addition to the 1 BTC you deposited), so you may withdraw 6 BTC in total.
At this point there is just enough money in your channels to get paid. For you to get paid, you'll need to take back the 1 BTC from neighbour A and all the rest from your other neighbours.
This means all your channels are effectively 1-way channels, and you might as well shut them down because you cannot receive any more money on them, not only that but you have to make sure none of them try to cheat by taking your money.

Electrum is (I'd say) very easy to use and accessible to non-nerds. I'd say most people who can use a web browser could use software like Electrum.
IMO, the thing that scares main-streamers most is the hacking element. They know enough to know that if their computer gets infected with a piece of malware or a keylogger then it's game over. Any bitcoins they have 'stored' on that computer can be stolen, and this scares them.
Now. Most people in developed nations these days use online banking and feel comfortable with using it, even if there's a virus on their computer, and that's because online banking uses 2-factor authentication. Not only that, if they do get hacked and have their money stolen, their bank will guarantee the funds and reimburse them. Similarly with credit cards, they simply have to call a number and they can have their credit card cancelled immediately if it's stolen. In a nutshell, banks/credit card companies put a lot of effort into ensuring the security of their customers' funds, and if things do go wrong, they do their best to fix it for the customer. All this gives the customer a sense of comfort. They feel like their money is safe.
Bitcoin offers none of this.
This is what scares people away or makes them reluctant to change any of their savings into bitcoin. Even if the price is skyrocketing and they know if they put 10% of their salary into Bitcoin every month they'd gain significant interest (actually STUPID interest!), but they don't, simply because of the technical risks which they don't fully understand but understand enough to know that if they do get hacked, they have no recourse.
What can be done to change this? Hardware wallets. That's it! Hardware wallets need to get cheaper though, there needs to be more advertising and marketing and they need to become the next cool accessory. Hardware wallets are still in the 'geeky' realm and are still quite expensive. But they are the key to mainstream adoption because once people understand that no hacker can hack a hardware wallet they'll be far more open to using it. Another great feature of hardware wallets is that they're a thing - an actual physical thing you can touch. This alone would generate a lot of interest, especially from people who receive them as gifts - people are more likely to try them out if it's a new thing they've been given as opposed to a piece of software somebody told them to download.
I remember when Wi-Fi first appeared in the early 2000's, I was very dubious at first, I was perfectly happy with my wired internet connection and couldn't understand why somebody would want to trade their perfectly reliable wired connection for a wireless connection that was un-tested, possibly slow, possibly unreliable, possibly insecure, and needed a great big, ugly USB dongle in order to use it, yet nowadays Wifi is everywhere and we all feel comfortable using it. Why is this?
Firstly, Wifi has become a lot more reliable. These days my wifi connection is rock-solid. This inspires confidence. The longer it stays up uninterrupted the more likely I am to keep using it. Second: It's secure. I've never been hacked through my wifi connection. There's no bad press about it and this inspires confidence. It's also a lot faster these days. I can stream movies off my wifi connection. My wifi router can handle several devices and has enough bandwidth for my TV, PS4, several laptops and several phones. Finally, there's no great big ugly dongle, which means it doesn't need to be bought seperately because Wifi now comes on a chip which is part of the motherboard. It's a *feature* rather than an accessory.
How can this be applied to Bitcoin? Well for reliability the blockchain has proven to be pretty reliable already but there's no limit to making the sotware reliable and easy to use. If bitcoin software looks and feels like online banking software and is as reliable this will inspire confidence. Security: Hardware wallets are the way to go because they decouple the security of the Bitcoin private keys from the security of the main device (laptop/desktop/android). When people understand this a big barrier will be removed.
People don't understand this.
Speed - it needs to get faster and cheaper. Bitcoin needs a micro-payment solution. I won't dwell on this, but if this problem isn't solved Bitcoin will never go mainstream. Ever. Transaction prices need to come down. I'll let the boffins sort this one out.
Finally there's the 'Big ugly USB dongle' issue. This is the really interesting one. If someone plugs a Trezor into their laptop their Bitcoin is safe from hackers, sure. But is is safe from people? Can't someone just grab the Trezor when they're not looking? Sure they can buy a new one and recover their private key, but that's just inconvenient. Wouldn't it be better if the hardware wallet was a chip soldered into the motherboard? This will all come in time, but in the intervening time the interesting things will happen in online transactions. When you go to Amazon and it's time to check out, there'll be a 'Pay with Bitcoin' option, and when you click on it, your Trezor will light up and say "Amazon wishes you to pay 0.0001 BTC, do you accept?". You touch yes or no, and type in your PIN, and your web browser does the rest of the work. Your package arrives by drone half an hour later.
This is:
1. Convenient
2. Fast
3. Cheap
4. Secure
5. Reliable
It ticks all the boxes that online banking tickes plus one more:
it is:
6. Permissionless
By this time the micro-transaction problem will have been solved. The credit card company is completely out of the picture now. This is a direct transaction between buyer and seller. This is efficient, but this is 20 years from now, so some more things will have changed. By this time, consumer computing devices are far less susceptible to hackers anyway, but the inbuilt hardware wallet provides that extra protection, it will be as standard as Wifi is today.
This is how it will roughly play out.

BTW, just in case you didn't know - the *absolute* hash rate of the bitcoin network means nothing - despite what you may have read - what makes the network secure is not a huge hash rate. What makes it secure is many, many unrelated parties all contributing to the hash rate.
Bitcoin doesn't really have that anymore, beucase since ASICs took over, the mining power has become more and more centralized because hobbyist miners could no longer compete with these huge mining farms. Even to buy a mining machine, you could pay several thousand $, spend the equivalent in electricity and mine absolutely nothing.
Not only that, a mining machine becomes a completely useless piece of junk once a superior mining machine is released. Once it can't "pay for itself" it is just junk.
Now that is inefficient.
At least you can sell an old laptop or still play games with an old graphics card.

@_date: 2017-11-11 22:36:14
What's your point exactly? Do you understand that the point of BCG is that it's ASIC-resistant - ie. it can be mined using ordinary run-of-the-mill CPUs and GPUs. The transaction speed will be the same (10 minutes for a confirmation) but there will probably be a longer wait for a "safe" transaction.
If there are many hobbyist miners at first, then some "big boys" hop on board, contributing to hash rate and pose the risk of a 51% attack, this could spark a wave of interest. 
I have a good feeling about this Bitcoin Gold, it could become the new real Bitcoin and put the power back in the hands of the people.

You're wrong to say bitcoin isn't fungible. Things aren't so black and white.

it's not. what about a tattered banknote? some establishments will accept it and some won't.
Just proved you wrong.
@_date: 2018-03-20 15:35:37
you're missing my point. Bank notes may have serial numbers, sure, but does every establishment check the serial numbers against a blacklist of 'tainted' notes before accepting them as payment?
Hell no!
That's my point. The same is true of bitcoin.
The bottom line is: As long as there are bitcoin mixing services, bitcoin will be fungible.  Sure you can blacklist certain coins and tell people not to accept them. But you can't make them.
The crux of the issue is there is no way to censor certain coins built into the code. In the bitcoin code all coins are treated equally. And code is all that matters. Everything else is politics.
Oh one final point:
As long as there's a demand for them, there will always be bitcoin mixing services.

I plan on doing this on 2 separate computers. I'm gonna generate some paper wallets on an airgapped computer, then send all the BTC on my current wallets (with both BTC and BCH) to these new paper wallets.
Then I plan on importing my old wallets (which now contain only BCH) into electron cash then sending the funds to an exchange then changing them into XEM and XMR
Are there any potential problems with this approach? I'd like to hear from somebody who's done it
Essentially what I'm wondering is should I send the BCH first or the BTC? From what I read the BCH protocol has strong replay protection so my transactions won't be replayed in the BTC network.

First off, the price of a single Bitcoin or Litecoin is meaningless. The only meaningful thing is market cap. You can easily divide or multiply by 10 and call it something else ... means nothing.
The only thing that matters is the ratio of the price yesterday to the price today - That's independent of the unit of account. Doesn't matter if it's BTC, Satoshis, Milli-litecoin, Mega-litecoin, or whatever.. the math works out the same.
You're right in saying it's easier to influence the Litecoin market than the Bitcoin market, but that's because Bitcoin has a bigger market cap. This has nothing to do with price though. Price is just market cap divided by some arbitrary constant.
I really don't see your point. Of course there's less money flowing into Litecoin, but that doesn't mean it's less profitable. If LTC moves up against BTC then it's more profitable. End of story.
EDIT: By the way, maybe you're not aware of this but Litecoin has a faster block time and faster emission rate than Bitcoin. There's around 55,000,000 LTC in circulation vs only 17,000,000 BTC. That's another reason *a single Litecoin* is worth less than a single Bitcoin. Even if LTC had the same marketcap of BTC the value of a single unit would still be lower (around $2000)
EDIT (2): Just checked the markets and LTC's 24-hour change is +4.29% vs BTC's +3.97%
Hope you learned something here

Well so far my funds are still safe on the blockchain. I figure if somebody had stolen my private keys by now they would have also stolen my funds by now. They have nothing to gain by waiting, and run the risk of me moving the funds on the longer they wait.
I took great care in preparing the keys; I disconnected my computer from the internet, I used open source key generation software which I vetted myself and had been on github for a long time and had no bad reports of any kind.
I used a 64 character passphrase for each wallet which I randomly generated using my brain. I used an alphabet of approximately 26+26+10+6 characters, meaning for somebody to guess a key they'd have to try approximately half the permutations, which is half of 68^64 (or  953982520916211924678617256040106923240360054772765514405292242065516066331405909535161171701443033068780525807730688). Also I split my funds into 4 wallets so multiply that number by 4 if they want all my funds.
Furthermore, I wrote the passphrase and key of each paper wallet, so even if I mistyped the key I probably didn't mistype the passphrase, and vice versa, checked them, then duplicated them again.
After running the key generation program and copying the bitcoin address to a text file, I rebooted the computer (to erase the memory) only then did I re-enable wifi. I know this isn't ideal and I really should have used an airgapped computer which never gets connected to the internet. If I was dealing with larger funds (like my life savings) I would have done this.
I'm now storing each replica of each paper wallet in a discreet place in 2 physical locations only I know about.

If you sell all your $50k you'd require a 10% swing upwards. Currently bitcoin is around $2000, so it would need to climb to $2200.
If it goes the other direction and hits $1800 you then need an upswing of $400 (20%).. and so on
Personally I'd wait for the market to bottom-out before you buy.. at the moment it seems to be hovering around the $2000 level, which, (if it stays there) will make me happy. I hear people saying it will go lower to $1500 or even $900. It's important to understand people will say these things to push the price even lower so they can get a better entry price.
Good luck with your trade

This is the right attitude to have. I only got into crypto currencies in the last 4-5 months and have invested some of my savings in bitcoin and other cryptos, enough that I can afford. 
Of course I'm not happy about the price falling in the last few days but that's the price is relative to fiat money. If I hold on to my coins until such a time as the scaling issue is fixed and bitcoin has become more mainstream (which I plan to)... then it's alright.
I still have 2 BTC on the blockchain and it will remain there safe. Nobody can steal it regardless of how the price fluctuates relative to the $ or the €. It will still be 2 BTC.
When the scaling issue is sorted out and it becomes practical to use bitcoin for small purchases like a can of soda, then the real show will begin.
When bitcoin can handle thousands of transactions per second only then will it cease to be a 'toy' currency and become the bedrock of planet earth's economic system
