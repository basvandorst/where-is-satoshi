If there was a Bitcoin bank, that was safe, with a sound ledger, that made a healthy amount of money that paid interest on my deposits I would deposit my money there.
The bank loans out bitcoins, the real thing, not a note, but I still would have money in the bank, as credit. Isn't that how the monetary supply would be expanded, even with a hard asset like gold and or bitcoin?
I feel like either I'm terribly wrong on this one or the world is going mad because I'm the only one who gets this.
I think the only difference is that in a healthy market the banks would be allowed to fail so that they don't take on to much risk and create too much debt/money.

This is the most interesting part for me.
Let me explain by a thought experiment.
Let's say there is a bank that would only accept 1 year deposits and only lends out 1 year loans, so in effect it is a middleman. In theory the amount of money lend out could be enourmous compared to the reserves of the bank but it's not really necessary to have reserves because it's more like a middleman.
Are you saying this shouldn't be possible?
@_date: 2015-01-26 09:22:48
It's a very imortant step IMHO. Bitcoin needs social proof for people to believe in it. The early adopters don't need this proof, but the mainstream sheeple need important names to take the lead.
@_date: 2015-01-12 18:42:23
A lot of times it's unnecessary to wait for a confirmation because the chances to pull of a double spend are quite small. Let's say the chances are 0.1% to pull of a zero confirmation after the transaction is broadcasted properly in the network. In that case to accept a $50 0-confirmation transaction costs about $0,05! Why let people wait up to 30 minutes for $0,05!
And what about multisig services like greenaddress. They make accepting 0-confirmation transactions practically risk-free.

Bitcoin has an advantage over fiat that it can't be printed.
And you can still invest in a sound bank. Banks are not inherently bad. It's the way banking is done that's bad.


Well yeah, that's another problem. It should be clear when your money is lent out and not available for you.
But even when it's clear the balance of debit and credit can still be problematic because it's not about how much money is circulating but the balance between debit and credit.
To word it in another way. If 21 million bitcoins are circulating but there are 210 million bitcoin bank credits all making a claim on those bitcoins it's still a problem.

So not all money is debt.


You stated that the vast majority of money is debt. So not all fiat money is debt. That makes at least some money an asset. So I get confused.


This is what I don't get but I think because there is an error in the logic. If bitcoin is lent to someone, it is a debt, but I could lend a real bitcoin from the blockchain to that person. In that situation real money is also debt. Money = debt? :) Do you get it?
So again, the real difference between Bitcoin and fiat is that bitcoin can't be manipulated. Everyone has an equal chance and there is no corruptable entity that can print money and transfer wealth from the holders of the money to themselves.

Isn't this going to happen to bitcoin?

Is debt as money not bad per se but isn 't it just that the balance is gone: Cheap credit, central bank manipulation.

On average yes, but there are many more factors to take into account.

Primarily because it opens up competition and will bring down margins and profits for the existing banks.
If cryptocurrencies become really dominant it might also do the following things:
- Higher interest rates which will end bubbles and the ever expanding amount of credit funding the cartel.
- Giving back power to savers to earn interest on their saving and taking that power back from bankers who can compete to savers in an unfair way by creat8ng credit out of thin air.

I'm thinking some form of centralized Bitcoin, so without a blockchain but with a central entity controlling the ledger.
It could still work with private and public keys and a public ledger, but there is only one entity controlling the ledger.
They could control the money supply or change entries.
Of course you would prefer bitcoin but the mainstream is rather gullible.

Well, I see how it's an expert option since you don't want to trouble beginners (or the mainstream) with these complicated processes, but I had a usecase where my cold storage exists of multiple "legacy" addresses with each a share of my coins.
I wanted to sweep them all and spread them out  to a HD cold storage wallet. So yeah I think in the end it would save you fees, but also time, since you only need one transaction and don't need to wait for the blockchain to catch up. I think there should be a way for the advanced user to get to the destination in the shortest way. :)
Another option that would be cool is if you were able to generate a PDF with a 12 word mnemonic and about 10 receiving addresses, some kind of cold storage HD wallet.

It's littered with plenty more examples where the first mover has won. Besides, VHS was way cheaper than Betamax and VHS was only released in the next year and recorders were still very expensive.
I don't see how anyone can predict how the future will play out but Bitcoin has a big advantage by having a 4 to 5 year advantage on any serious contender. Is it a guarantee no? Is it a big advantage? Yes indeed.
There is definitely value in being a first mover although more things have to be taken into account.

I can confirm the error is in Wallet32.
I checked the unspent outputs in Wallet 0 in Mycelium and checked Wallet32. All the addresses in Wallet32 are actually there but one change address shows zero by mistake. I've checked blockchain.info to be sure and there is a balance in the blockchain.
I didn't check Wallet 1. I assume it's the same problem.

Sure, somebody might sincerely be oblivious to the coming revolution but OP probably experienced a defensiveness that was based on false logic and false facts and concluded it was ignorance. He is quite possibly right.

When a new crisis event hits there will be a lot of selling pressure in traditional markets like gold and silver because leverage is unwinding and because of margin calls.
I don't see that  happen with bitcoin.

You don't understand anarchy.
Anarchy doesn't mean chaos. Anarchy comes from the latin word Archos which means ruler. Anarchy means no ruler. 
If noone rules you have respect for each other's personal boundaries and posessions. That's far from being chaos.
Anarchy is ultimate order, sovereignty for every being.

Most companies let you transfer a share of your net wages to another account.
Let them transfer the money to kraken.com with the right transfer info.
As soon as the money is in Kraken you buy coins. If it's possible to autobuy bitcoins in Kraken as soon as the money arrives you could do that too.

I would like to see a bar that will charge to 100% when receiving a transaction showing how low the risk is of a double spend.
How is the transaction propageted through the network? Is the sender known and trusted? Is the transaction fee sufficient? Maybe there are more things that can be taken into account. All these things result in a reliable estimation of the chance for the transaction to be included in the blockchain.

Unique, but trying to get someone to accept darkcoin is more work then just mixing your bitcoins.
Besides, there will plenty of decentralized services to make bitcoin anonymous.

No consumer ever would send his money to some anonymous persons who can run with their money practically without consequences. This crime is totally related to how politics shape this market.
These coins were stolen because people don't have any better option to buy drugs.

Libertarianism doesn't mean lawlessness. When someone steals funds they should go to jail.
Libertarians generally are just against regulations that force companies to behave in some kind of way.
Libertarianism is also about self regulation. Consumers are expected to pick the safest product if everything else is equal and businesses will compete for costumers with safe products.
Some other exapmles of free market self regulation: Voluntary audits, bank guarantees, proof of solvency, voluntary free market regulation, consumer insurance, consumer advocating groups, free market licensing, quality marks and personal accountability.
No offence taken by the way!

You could create a private and public key. I could send my funds to your address by sending a signed message to the centralized ledger proving I own the funds.

But you can send bitcoin like an email. To send a dollar I need a bankaccount.
They could think of a solution where they control the ledger but a system with private and public keys so someone can send fiat like email.

Bitcoin is a protocol which can be build upon. Just like TCP/IP is a protocol for sending information, Bitcoin is a protocol for sending value.
This creates a whole new platform for development with endless possibilities.

Digital fiat isn't peer to peer or programmable.
I think governments will feel pressured to make a peer to peer and programmable kind of money to keep control of the money supply.

Interest rates are lower but banks get cheaper financing too because the role of savers is less prominent.
And people need to borrow a much larger sum because asset prices are inflated. So the rates might be lower but the total interest paid is higher.
There is also another negative consequence where businesses  and people are prone to make bad economic decisions in asset bubbles resulting in wasted resources.

How can interested newbies who receive a small tip play around with btc?
@_date: 2015-03-14 20:26:44
I kindly disagree. This touches one of the core principles of bitcoin: You don't need anyone's permission to move your money and they can't take any of it like they do now with negative interest rates. This is starting to look like financial fascism.
