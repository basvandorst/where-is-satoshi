i've been using bitcoin for well over 7 years now and it's a seamless experience compared to the lightning network. 
wanted to play chess with my friend on koalastud.io, downloaded the lightning app from lightning.engineering, tried to send payments countless of times and nothing would work. opened a channel even and still the payments wouldn't go through. 
just really frustrating.

of what relevance is that difference from a practical standpoint? he said that no hardware device is immune from an advanced thief who has it. 'advanced' here can mean someone who is willing to torture you. credible attack vectors that leave no evidence hardly matter to a truly advanced thief.
@_date: 2019-07-02 02:41:31
it feels like the only reason positive posts about the lightning network get upvoted here is because they're positive news about something bitcoin related.
i saw one of these posts about how much capacity the lightning work has and how it is superior to altcoins and downloaded the lightning app. it was an absolutely awful experience. it's hard to open channels, it's hard to pay and it's hard to request payments. everything is either very slow or it doesn't work at all.
the lightning network payments haven't surpassed shit. it's hard and unintuitive to use and until it stops, it will never provide a better user experience than most shitcoins right now.

the fact that it may be the fault of the person doesn't make the sale of hard drugs necessarily peaceful. people like to throw around words like "willfull" when it comes to drug transactions as if it gets rid of every moral qualm. is a drug addict really "willful" in his desire to make "voluntary trade"? and by selling heroin to the addict so he can inflict more suffering upon himself and his close ones, you're still contributing to someone else's destruction. albeit without the element of violence of the current drug distribution system employed by cartels.

Why are they going to execute "our" worst fears? They are a private company motivated by profit. If they choose to double spend, they will destroy the integrity of the network and cause everyone to divest, destroying their own profits in the process. It would be extremely stupid of them to try it. 
You have been frantically waving your arms across the entire front page but I have yet to see you post something substantial that proves that GHash is really is as stupid and evil as you try to portray them to be. I have seen the discussion with regards to attempted double spends and I buy their explanation. 
The fact that they are close to 51% is undoubtedly negative but you are trying to start a panic with unfounded claims that they will attack the network as soon as they are able to do so.

i started watching, got to the part where he attempts to debunk the volatility argument by saying that bitcoin is as stable as it has ever been and "there are graphs to prove" that bitcoin will only be more stable in the future. i stopped watching it there.
the volatility argument is a bad one NOT because bitcoin has been stable for a few months. price went down by well over 50% in 2014. that is extremely volatile by any standard! and to say that there are graphs to prove that bitcoin will only be more stable in the future is just false. the visual similarity between whatever charts you want to compare has absolutely no meaningful relationship to its future behaviour. 
the way to attack the volatility argument is not to say that it is not accurate (because it is). it's also not to try to prove that volatility won't exist because we have some charts. the best way to attack it is to show that it is irrelevant.
 
the volatility argument is a bad one because it is irrelevant as to whether or not bitcoin has utility to society or not. volatility is something that's going to be present only in the initial stages of the currency on its way to mass adoption (if it ever gets there and doesn't die for some other reason). it's something that's going to gradually go away as more and more individuals find that bitcoin is useful.

the takeaway is that the blockchain technology is the future, but bitcoin itself might not be.
@_date: 2014-01-22 22:31:14
1) i don't think it is true that it establishes that there is real demand. i think it's a lot more likely (and a much better strategy from their perspective) that they are exploiting the bitcoin community who will throw money at anything that makes mention of the word "adoption." and i'm not saying this is bad. i think it's great that the community does a lot to promote bitcoin. but that's where most of the BTC is going to come from-- from people who want bitcoin to succeed-- not from people who actually want to buy what app.net is selling. they're smart enough to know what the bitcoin community is like and they're smart enough to know that their drive up would wind up on the pages of bitcointalk and reddit.
2) i sincerely doubt that the the equivalent of 10BTC (8,280 USD at the time of writing) is what they need to set it up despite the set up not being free. using bitcoin is profitable in and of itself for the many reasons we all love it for. this drive is nothing but a moneygrab.

i keep clicking this guy's links for some reason and nothing he ever says seems to make any sense. he just rambles on incoherently and then strings his random assumptions together to come to another seemingly random conclusion.


this is just false. see: litecoin surpassing namecoin, ripple surpassing litecoin, doge surpassing namecoin, etc. 


...seriously, what?
how do you come to the conclusion that bitcoin has been SURPASSED without using the values as the primary metric? you don't really have to, but then you'd have to at least provide an argument for why value should not be used as the primary metric of determining which cryptocurrency has surpassed another one. and these arguments exist (e.g., value is not nearly as relevant as transaction volume is), but you don't really go into it at all.
the rest of the article is stringing together of more random assumptions and stupid claims, like this:

wish i could say the same. i entered the coupon code and got the $75 discount. tried to check out and then decided that i want to buy enough to get the $150 discount so i just closed the bitpay 15 minute confirmation window. after that the coupon code would not work. the discount would show up on the order but when the bitpay address came up it attempted to charge the non-discounted price. i was chatting with 3 different sales reps for well over 3 hours but none of them were able to help, with one of them saying that they do not offer bitcoin promotions, the other saying that i have to be subscribed to the newsletter to be eligible for the coupon code (which is not true because it worked the first time although i canceled it) and thought that the cause of this was the uncancelled initial order. after canceling it, i was able to enter the coupon code again but it still attempted to charge me full price at the bitpay window.

trustlessness in bitcoin means you don't have to trust a third party to transfer value. it does NOT imply anonymity. 
it also doesn't mean that the trustlessness is compromised if you use that trustless method of value transfer in a system that requires trust, which is what you are saying. it's like saying, "if i use bitcoin, a trustless method of value transfer, to transfer value to a bank, which is not a trustless system, then the trustlessness of bitcoin becomes questionable." it doesn't make any sense.

bitcoin is not officially recognized by the canadian government as a currency, stock or any type of good that has value. and since it is not recognized as such, one does not have to obtain a money services business license to provide exchange services. there is consequently nothing to be compliant with. as stated by bitcoiniac in this thread, they have disabled the security features of the ATM which allow the purchases to be completely anonymous. not that it even matters; if someone chooses to purchase bitcoin through unsafe means, they should be able to do so without having someone trying to call the police on them.

no, he is actually quite right and everyone in this thread is quite wrong. 
e.g., block reward is 25.1 bitcoins per block (reward and fees) which is worth around 15k usd. if the last 6 blocks had 500 transactions per block, then 15k/500 = 30 dollars per transaction.

the only argument i am a part of is that asked the question about interaction between a hypothetical private blockchain and the bitcoin blockchain and you provided an analogy that a) wasn't really analogous and b) didn't answer his question at all. whether the term "private blockchain" has any meaning is completely separate to the discussion you and i are having. however, it is completely relevant to the question that had asked. and that's what your initial response to should have been. there was no need to try and seem smarter than you are by "clever" references to english comprehension and links to the bitcoin wiki after it had been made clear that your analogy was wrong and irrelevant.

i like what they are doing for bitcoin and i think this interview is superior to any other one they've ever done. however, i don't buy the argument that they "have their whole body in the game" just because the are opening an exchange and filed for an etf. they own a lot of bitcoins and the costs of doing opening the exchange or applying for the etf are miniscule compared to the potential benefit that they will reap if bitcoin ever becomes a mainstream currency.

"numbers 19 and 35 are both greater than the number 5, therefore it's not a bubble!"
if bitcoin is not "a bubble" (whatever that even means-- was the internet in the 90s "a bubble"?), it's definitely not because two other companies are valued higher than the "market cap" of bitcoin (which is also non-sensical because the way it is calculated is just market price * amount of bitcoins in existence).

given that you get a display of options and bitcoin is one of them when you attempt to make a deposit or cashout, those that withdraw and deposit do.  it's hard to estimate the percentage, but the site is operating illegally in  america so there's a lot of incentive not to play there (site can get raided by DOJ, they have to use shady payment processors, owners can run off with money, etc.). the fact that they accept bitcoin isn't going to make people play that wouldn't have been playing already for this reason.

his multiple buys and support of bitcoin is evidence of his support of bitcoin, nothing more. it's not evidence of anything regarding to his views on bitcoin and fiat. i own some bitcoin too, and i posted about it on twitter. that doesn't mean that i think bitcoin is superior to fiat. it also doesn't mean that i am "being successful." i may very well lose money on my investment.

they analyzed the writing style of 'satoshi nakamoto' and attempted to match it stylistically to the writing of other known persons. nick szabo was a close match. but if 'satoshi nakamoto' is multiple people, then they effectively analyzed the writing of multiple people and attempted to match it to a single person. this means the result is meaningless. it also doesn't confirm that he is a single person, just that the writing style of potentially many people matches the writing style of a single person. they could have also easily had a single person writing and other people developing.

again, the expertise of anyone on the topic is immaterial to the point that i am making. do you know what a guarantee is? do you not understand that someone of vitalik's stature has an identity that can be held to when it comes to their guarantee and someone's 3 month reddit account does not?

that's a very specific definition of retirement. you can also retire for zero cost right now if you learn how to be self-sustaining and hunt your own food for the rest of your life and that would be technically retirement also. but most wouldn't agree with that definition.
retirement to most doesn't mean "scrimp and save for the rest of your life." it means being able to sustain a comfortable standard of living that they are currently used to without having to work for the rest of your life. and 330k invested anywhere (besides bitcoin maybe :p) won't get you anywhere close to that.

why is it going to change everything in major cities? has anyone actually sat down and thought about this from a logical, non-circlejerk point of view? 
who would buy these machines from a profit perspective? even if you charge crazy transaction rates, it will be extremely hard to make it a good investment to warrant spending $5,000 on one of these. the reasons are many.  
1) it is unclear whether selling your bitcoins for cash and charging transactions fees will offset the amount you could have made if you had just kept them. the fact that it is a one way ATM means you constantly need to sell bitcoins. this means that you also have to constantly buy them. given that the BTC/USD fluctuates a lot throughout the day, it is very easy to have losing days that you cannot predict.  
2) the volume of BTC. maybe if we lived in a world where BTC had replaced the USD, 1) would not be a concern at all due to the fact that this sheer volume of transactions wouldn't even make a lamassu owner of thinking about hoarding those bitcoins instead. but we do not. i have ads on craigslist and localbitcoins, i live in a city that was recently on the news with regards to bitcoin adoption (vancouver), but i do not receive enough e-mails to think that this machine will be profitable. bitcoin is just not popular enough. the only counter-argument to this i can think of is the fact that when the next bitcoin bubble comes about, people will flock to these machines. but nobody really knows when that is going to be, which makes buying one of these in hopes of hitting it big during the next bitcoin bubble gambling, essentially.  
3) security. aside from the fact that this machine is fairly new and untested, it also seems extremely easy to steal. this means you need to have it in a place with 24/7 surveillance. it also means you need to be able to troubleshoot it 24/7. and that seems like a lot of work.
are they good for bitcoin overall? yeah, it generates some buzz, and it makes it a bit more convenient to buy bitcoins. but it's hardly going to change everything in major cities. in fact, it's hardly going to change anything at all.
