Good points.  The IRS can make bitcoin as illegal as they want. Nothing will ever change the fact that bitcoins will continue to exist, everywhere, with value.

Epic. "The last time government had this much power over the economy was in the waning days of the Roman Empire."

What is the fastest way to trade/speculate? Coinbase takes 4 days to take money from my cash bank account, and then several days to return it. There's no way I can take advantage of the highs and lows of the market.

The question now is, how valuable is a list of emails belonging to people who use bitcoin? Because if there's one thing circle does have, it is that list.

I'd google it, but I trust you guys way more.

You really need google to tell you the price of bitcoin?

This is why the price of a BTC is going down. Places like Overstock dump their bitcoin right away,

In exchange for what?

First they ignore you, then they laugh at you...

If they stick with that "Bitcoin Inside" logo Intel will sue for trademark infringement and trademark dilution.

Lawyers can be creative. And why are you yelling at me?

I wonder whether MIT will try to patent any of the future work these guys do.

how the hell do you freeze a Bitcoin account? This doesn't make any sense.
