I think it is almost a self fulfilling prophecy when a lit of people keep saying prices will drop to "x" price. As everyone starts to believe it...

ok... You have missed the point of the post though. I am not saying that it does cost $6000 as I am aware it depends upon electricity cost mainly in that country and of course difficulty.

thank you :)

This was my impression... otherwise the argument makes little sense. Thank you all for clearing it up :)  
In regards to the difficulty increasing or decreasing how often/quickly is that done dependant upon miners? Or is that the wrong way to look at it

Alright dude. You need to read some books on psychology of financial markets. Then you can form a more educated opinion.

Like i said... i understand the strategy. To buy and forget for a few years. But thats not a strategy. Thats closing your eyes and opening them back up in the hope of more money.

Probably been longer than most. And if you understand the cycle. Btc pumps and thej dumps. Each time with greater magnitude. We pumped to 20k and saw an 70%+ sell off as normal. I took advantage of that to accunulate more. Hodl and you lost 70%. Feel like i have to spoon feed knowledge into it. Omg "just hodl, 20k, just hodl 17k just hodl, 15k, just hodl, 6800 hahahaha" now you should be buying... but oh wait. You hodled
