I see a lot of complaining in this thread. So if you were on Colbert, what would you have said?

Thank you!
I have never done anything like this before  -transferring money, converting currency, putting trust in others to make the transactions happen- and in this whole process have no real idea what to expect. I suspect there are a good number of people in the same boat. After seeing the transaction failure and finding no money in my Dwolla account, *then* coming to reddit and seeing this post, well lets just say I was beside myself.. 
So thank you for putting my mind at ease. I really appreciate your fast response.

You said that much better than I did ;)

Nailed it. Bitcoin is being looked at solely as a investment opportunity, not as a currency with buying power. Why would I buy anything with bitcoin when a few days later I could buy more with the same amount of bitcoin.
As I said in a thread the other day - that kind of increasing value is even bad for drug dealers.

Your site says my order failed, but the money in my Dwolla account is gone. Order ID:

You should have gotten a pm from the bitcointip bot asking you to accept or decline. Check your msgs.

OMG!! Thank you so much!!

So why didn't this one verify? This whole tipper thing is still very mystifying to me..
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:18:00
Haha, my situation exactly ;)
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:24:08
Wow, thank you for the quick fix! 
So... the bitcoins should be pending transfer to my account?

I keep seeing people in the IRC talk about individual buy/sell's, where are you finding this data?

Can someone explain to me why I would buy anything form anyone excepting bitcoins? 
Bitcoin was worth $40 a coin a few days ago, and say I bought a laptop from BitMit for $300 (B7.5). On todays bitcoin value ($55 a coin) I spent $412.50 on that laptop.
I mean, that kind of increase in value is even bad for drug dealers.. Isn't that what The Economist is pointing out?

Ahhhh... they make a killing in transaction fees. Their *business* is doing just fine.
@_date: 2013-04-18 07:14:43
How was it comically misleading? 
@_date: 2013-04-01 19:27:53
Your not alone man.. your not alone :(
@_date: 2013-03-29 18:58:45
This would be a really great tool for ! 
Very cool, thank you.  :)

You can't blame them. Anyone who bought in yesterday saw the value of their investment drop over 50%.
