no it probably was one of your new "friends" that you met on telegram.

it doesn't get any more official than that.

you've got no one but the blockstream team to blame for those problems. 
bitcoin cash doesn't have any of those problems.

we will never see 1800 again

that's actually not as easy as you think. the price could have gone anywhere. it could have resumed going up the day after he made that post. it could have crashed and stayed much lower long after that window. 
 
you are just bias to think it was an easy prediction because he was right.

you should check out you'll get better advice there.

OP I suggest you move your money to BCC. As you can see from the responses, not only is there not a roadmap, but most of the hardcore bitcoin believers don't even care or see the value in having a roadmap.

yeah I probably will leave some in.

I thought the BIP91 activation makes the BIP141 moot? And that what we've had so far is not the actual BIP91 activation but miners just indicating they have intention to activate BIP91?

its the 61.8% fib retracement from our current high and the location of last strong support. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 01:58:55
We are waiting for the BIP 141 (Segregated Witness) to reach 80%, correct?

we've failed to breach $3000 like ten times, and we're making lower and lower highs. And we've crossed the trendline that we following since we were at $1750.
