Awful and misleading chart, especially for derivatives. 
The notional value of the derivative market is pretty much irrelevant.

Thank you mister Internet tough guy for the calm and reasoned arguments you make.
Unfortunately I don't give a shit about asset pricing models, since the only kind of involvement I have with the financial markets is in my quality of a Forex and CFD's trader.
And while we're on the subject of systemic risk I've made a lot of money lately by shorting gold, so please excuse me if I don't subscribe to this zerohedge doomsday bear sort of thinking.
Are there systemic risks in the system? Of course there are. Greed and fear are guaranteed to produce them and as long as they're around the danger will always be there in some form or another.
Nonetheless the point I made initially still stands, because a large amount of derivatives do cancel out. As for the rest of derivatives, good luck figuring out the allocation and risk profile for each. It should keep you busy for a while. I prefer making money instead by using incomplete information and my wits.

Electronic money and gold to be more precise, but is there any other kind with even remotely similar liquidity?
Maybe you're right with the automated revenue stream, but I like having fun too and seeing your own analysis pay off is one of the best feelings in the world. Success is one hell of a drug.
I'm by no means a billionaire, but I am at a profit and in a zero-sum game that means something.

True free markets always evolve into oligopolies or monopolies, since they are the most efficient forms of capital accumulation.
It's how the world works.

That's a non-sequitur. Shitty measurements don't imply anything beyond being shitty.
To give you an example what's wrong with notional measurement:
Assume A has a loan with a variable rate between 2%-5% with a value of 1 million dollars. He really hates the volatility so he wants a fixed rate. B offers to pay the installments at the volatile rate, in exchange for A paying B installments with a fixed rate of 4%.
The value of the loan stays the same, but you've just added 2 million dollars in notional value to the derivatives market.
This is called a credit swap and in this age of high frequency trading, such deals can last literal microseconds, each time adding more to the notional value of the market, although they cancel each other out at a blink of an eye.

Fun and a friendly community?

Is localization a solution? 
Imagine that each terminal that accepts BTC also acts as a verification node and they would process with priority orders with a low latency (close physical location). 
Statistically this would be a biased sample from the pool, however since all these verification nodes would have the incentive to get it right (since they belong to merchants), I think that it would be an acceptable solution and it would bring processing times down considerably. 
Am I missing something?
@_date: 2014-12-05 23:25:47
No I can't, I'm not a coder. What I can point out though is the simple fact that BTC is meant to have a limited supply, effectively trying to mirror a commodity much loved by libertarians, more exactly gold. This in turn encourages hoarding rather than spending/consumption.
I make no particular judgement on this state of things, but most mainstream economists do and they tend to believe it's a really bad idea. These are the same economists that advise major corporations and governments on what they should do.
Now this is a catch 22. A cryptocurrency with builtin inflation will fail to take off, while a cryptocurrency with no builtin inflation will only reach limited acceptance. Hence my conclusion: the future of the blockchain technology does not lie in cryptocurrencies.

Goddamn it! Only 3 comments and someone already said what I wanted to say.

Nice :) Thanks for the tip.

I would go with Charlie Stross, the scifi author. [This article]( from his blog raises a lot of decent skeptical points.

Because taxes pay for shit like roads, firemen and public schools? Outrageous concept, I know.

You should drop anonymity from the list. It's just a dangerous assumption. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 13:03:05
TBH these same 10 points could apply to any cryptocurrency.
Personally I believe that despite the fact that Bitcoin is the most widespread application of the blockchain technology, it is in fact a dead end. The libertarian ideology encoded into BTC will make its widespread adoption impossible (and I'm talking about something similar to email's level of adoption).
Saying that, I also believe that blockchain technology will eventually reach the mainstream, but through platforms like Ripple, Stellar or Ethereum rather than in a form of a cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:52:27
Yeah it all sounds good until you reach the concepts of externality, limitations of the free market and game theory.

bitcoin-betting-guide.com 
Sounds legit.
Seriously, the BTC news community needs to invest in better domain names.
@_date: 2014-03-10 13:15:03
A few suggestions:
Figure out a way to make BTC transactions instant. This is seriously one big drawback if for example you want to buy something at the grocery shop down the corner.
Address the volatility aspect through a derivative market. I know that there are plenty of futures marketplaces, but they're targeted at speculators, rather than at people who want to protect their investment.
Create a service that allows people to link their identity to their wallet. Sounds counterintuitive and against the privacy mantra, but such a service would appeal to the people that like the technology but are not necessarily attracted by the crypto-anarchist angle. Furthermore businesses would feel much more at ease with accepting orders from such accounts.
Make one of these things happen and you'll revolutionize BTC.

Erm, 360 would be a complete circle, so you'd end up in the same place.

Think the test started yesterday, when the mempool jumped to around 48 MB.
Nonetheless it failed miserably. The mempool is still around 27 MB, but the number of unprocessed transactions is something like 2.5k, which is about normal. 
This makes me believe that miners either ignore some transactions they recognize as spam or prioritize transactions based on fee/transaction size (satoshis/byte). The second approach actually seems rather elegant. 
Maybe someone involved in mining could clarify this.
@_date: 2015-09-09 13:44:35
Spam? Maybe not. Malicious? Most definitely.
@_date: 2015-09-09 09:20:26
Did a bit more digging around and found the [output address]( in the stress test. Since some transactions are confirmed, it seems this prioritization is real.
By the way, this method no longer requires wallets and users to increase their fees. The "stress test" used a fee of 0.0007 BTC, while the standard is around 0.0001 BTC, but the fee/size metric for the test is about 1 satoshi/byte, while regular transactions even with lower fees usually have the fee/size in the double digits.
@_date: 2015-09-09 13:43:58
The cost would be prohibitive. The average size of a regular transaction is somewhere at 300 bytes I think. The stress test features a transaction size of 73,541 bytes.
Even so, if cost would not be an issue larger blocks wouldn't be a viable defense since the attacker could simply increase their efforts.
A more sensible approach would be pattern detection and the assignment of a low priority for transactions deemed as part of an attack (which is in a sense what the miners are already doing).

I'll have to agree with [r/Buttcoin]( on this one
@_date: 2015-03-17 08:28:06
I've read some awful cryptocurrency articles, but this one takes the cake.
Ripple is not undermining Bitcoin, Ripple is not aimed at individual consumers. Its goal is to replace the current clearinghouse system underpinning the financial system and thus make it considerably faster and cheaper to operate. It's a niche application of the blockchain technology.
There are of course other potential applications, but this is its main attraction. 
Also, going on through this whole debate based on the word of an investor is just retarded. If I buy a few stocks in Overstock and say something similar about Bitcoin, will you guys come to the conclusion that Overstock now hates  BTC?

That kinda hits the nail. I knew about BitCoin for a while but only yesterday I began taking serious interest in it, so I downloaded Multibit, passworded the wallet and went experimenting.
One day later, I have the equivalent of 6 cents in BitCoin :), while also discovering that Bitcoin faucets are a waste of time. Baby steps.
