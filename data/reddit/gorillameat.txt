Honest question as someone's who's financial institutional knowledge goes about as far as comprehending Michael Lewis books. With the rapid rise in price a lot people seem concerned over this pump being "the banks" so the banks can short bitcoin once the futures market opens. Wouldn't that be a risky bet for a bank to make with any significant money? Especially since their own pump would only drive the hype to jump into bitcoin for average people. With the news yesterday that BTC has a higher market value than Chase Bank, couldn't a failed short of the magnitude people are fearing actually wipe a bank out? Thereby furthering the acceptance of BTC?

At this point Jim would need a lot more than 1 billion dollars to make a noticeable pump. That's 0.3% of current market cap.

This question is mostly due to my complete lack of understanding of futures. Is this a move that legitimizes and cements bitcoin or is this a more covert attempt to kill it?

For argument sake let's say all of Wall Street has a secret pact with each other to remove 10 billion at the same coordinated moment in an effort to cause a panic. That's less than 4% market cap, it's momentarily moved down more than that multiple times today and we're all still here. Calm down everyone, welcome to the future.

At this rate, I'm worried we might not see a grown man eat his own dick.

Bitcoin is dead.
