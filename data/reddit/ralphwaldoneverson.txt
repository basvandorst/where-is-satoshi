An 11 year old can't open a bank account either. Doesn't mean I didn't have my own since elementary school. Are you just thing to find something wrong with actual money or do you have some kind of point here?

1/millions of legitimate businesses
If you believe for one second that a larger percent of transactions are illegal thru dollar than thru bitcoin, then you're delusional.

If Bitcoin had a fixed value and wasn't so volitile, you'd be right. If I could link with my debit card so that I can go bank &gt; bitcoins &gt; product like the merchants do consumer &gt; bitcoins &gt; banks then I would be happy and fine with using it as a medium for transactions. It's actual value wouldn't matter at all provided we are only using it for a fraction of a second. Holding anything with bitcoin is a bad idea.

Think of percentage of transactions going to illegal activity.  Bitcoin is undeniably magnitudes higher.

No. It was actually a joke. There's no lethal dose of marihuana. You should educate yourself.

You know what's gross?  The fact that everyone can see every bitcoin transaction.  Your shit isn't anonymous

If only there existed some entity that could protect us from financial crimes and prosecute those who commit them.

Wtf is a trezzor?  Is that the thing that people without my functional voice boxes use?

What?  I was saying that if he were using real currency, he could be prosecuted by the Feds.

It wasn't funny so it couldn't have been a joke.
