Sharing digital files does not exist. When you share stuff in the real world, you lose ownership and you wished they give it back soon. When you "share" files, you are just **copying** files, you don't lose ownership, it's still in your computer. Just like when you play those overrated pokemon games where you "trade" monsters with other player, when in reality, the game was reading monster data, makes a copy on someone's game and wipe off your monster from your game(IN BEFORE CHILDHOOD IS RUINED TRAIN). Sharing does not equal copying.
Also I grew up using a windows xp machine(not the the glorious amiga/tandy/zxspectrum/apple2/ii////][/anything else to add? old-ass computer golden age), and I didn't liked that fight club movie. I say this because it's relevant, right? No.

Pizzas are overrated food, that goes the same thing with bacon. These meme-foods are used to decieve you, next time someone talks about pizza just say "No, you do not connect with your audience. You are not pulling my leg based on the food that corporations and my colleagues brainwashed me as a youth. You do not have my undivided attention!"
