It's only a wild ride if you have more money in it than you can handle 
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:47:59
The people who did not lose money knew better. It's called survival of the fittest 
@_date: 2016-08-07 02:10:57
PSA. You should not have more than 10% of your networth in crypto. You should not have more than 25% on any one exchange. If you are not actively trading it , place the crypto in a paper wallet. If you have no idea what I am talking about go back to your money marker account now 
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:44:30
What makes it worse like any bad situation is when you get people that act like children.  9 times out of 10 it is because they were gambling with money they should not have been and now they want to blame anyone but themselves. We are very early in crypto and it can be made back. There are plenty of people that went through mt gox and are back. If you read any basic trading book and I mean any of them they all say protect assets so if you take a hit you have assets to fight back and learn. If you did not follow this rule it is your fault. Furthermore you will never become a profitable trader if you don't take hits that hurt. Never.

ya and dont think your going to bed lol
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:01:11
Well said!
@_date: 2016-08-06 00:55:38
Sounds like all trades associated with btc will get a haircut  of some sort .
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:46:45
At some point the exchanges will setup an insurance organization that all trades get taxed on I suspect 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:40:17
You can't let them withdraw in general or you can't let them withdraw cash
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:49:08
Go back to your bank account your here for greed and can't handle the risk 
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:15:18
No not really a lose is a lose and in crypto anything can happen
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:30:28
My ethereum is up 500% in my coldstorage maybe your on the wrong crypto then. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 02:21:08
Then why would you leave money on an exchange for .03% a day 
@_date: 2016-08-06 00:00:49
Great thanks .  
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:49:59
Do we have to withdraw will trading start up 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:17:35
Sounds like fiat is safe from what I read 
@_date: 2016-08-05 19:40:36
You know the risk don't bs us
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:32:12
And then the next time they protect more 
@_date: 2016-08-09 18:14:58
Any eta today for trading yet
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:18:22
Zane thank you for handling a difficult situation professionally. I would want to trade were you reside prodessionally. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:02:54
Let me see EVERYWHERE IT IS POSTED THAT IF YOU DONT WANT TO RISK YOUR MONEY DONT LEAVE IT ON AN EXCHANGE what part of that dont you understand or are you just stupid?
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:06:35
you could call it bitfincoin
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:44:25
you made numerous mistakes and Im sorry. but your greedy and lack of skill in a a very very aggressive market caused you harm. Why do you think major banks still dont allow crypto trading.  Learn from this and move forward., However stopp  trying to blame others for your mistakes. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 02:21:47
Bfx has not been keeping us in the dark however there are some issue that take time.  Have you ever ran a multimillion dollar business with 1000s of people counting  on you ?  Obviously you have not 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:06:04
If it was non btc and siting in exchange wallet side balance should be correct ? With nothing in margin /trading side.
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:02:01
Yeah so shut the f****** up go  back to your bank
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:59:42
U/hkispartofchina You sound like a crying baby. Why are you even in crypto . Seriously go back to your bank and wait a few years and you can buy it there safe and sound. Crypto is the wild wild west. If you spent anytime reading before you committed money you would have read not to keep money on exchanges . There have been many hacks . Did you miss the DAO hack or are you that stupid. Now stfu and be patient asshole. Bitfinex is doing an outstanding job in a very difficult environment .
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:01:13
This is exactly what I said 
@_date: 2016-08-07 02:09:20
Zane please continue to keep your cool and be professional. I thank you for the hard work you are doing. Hopefully many young traders will learn from this experience. I'm amazed at how many want to blame others. I can only believe they are young and naive and had way to much money on 1 exchange 
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:30:12
People need to realize is if there is malicious  software on their servers they still have not found and they bring the site up what if it continues to steal bitcoin. Most people have no idea what bfx is going through. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 19:39:41
Not in usa
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:51:54
I'm not saying don't trade I have traded more than 95% of the people on here. You have to protect against blackswan events if you want to be in this longterm 
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:42:26
1% interest a day is nothing are you serious??. You deserve to lose all your money if you think that roflmao.  Try compounding 1% a day for 10 year and see what your $100 turns into. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:47:06
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:17:18
I was in the DAO with 20% of the houses money. All back now. You have to mitigate losses.
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:04:05
why and the hell would you ever use 1 exchange are you people really this stupid?????
@_date: 2016-08-06 12:25:25
They would pay you in today usd dollars not in btc . They know better than that . 
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:04:30
I owned no btc however I would donate to bfxcoin to help out. I want bfx to survive 
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:05:01
When you loan money out and you expect to get 1% a day are you really that stupid to think you have no risk?????? Go back to your bank account I am so sick and tired of all the crying 
@_date: 2016-04-23 01:04:59
it is not going away if you live in the US. Everyone tips. (except cheap asses. Don't be a cheap ass)
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:04:41
so my guess would be you have to look at every individual account and make sure it is settled with all loans and orders closed. There probably is not other way to do it other than looking at each one individually? 
@_date: 2016-04-23 01:09:08
you will be very sorry. 
@_date: 2016-04-23 02:32:42
When you understand the very limited supply of gbtc that is available you will start to realize the reason for the premium. Think of all the qualified accounts in the USA that will want btc exposure. Currently this is the only way 
@_date: 2016-04-23 01:13:55
If you believe a new bubble is coming buy GBTC. I believe. You can not short it because it is not marginable
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:51:37
sounds like only btc positions will be affected with a haircut.  just reading a lot
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:29:15
It will get more secure. Be patient . Right now it is like your on a stage coach moving across the west to California hoping bandits don't find you . It will get more secure . Takes time . Read your history on the railroad boom auto boom early 1900 and the Internet boom. This is no different 
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:45:31
they can when it is so early in the game. THey are the only exchange to allow unverified margin, api high liquidity trading. The  exchange
@_date: 2016-08-05 23:16:31
Zane can you at least get some more info? Are they still trying to figure out how the hack happened? Are they still b balancing accounts? What are they working on. We need more incite at this point? Are still just reviewing options?  
@_date: 2016-08-06 12:21:52
On u/zanetackett what is the latest 
@_date: 2016-04-23 01:06:44
I second this.... and they are going to $1000 each. Oh except mine are in my ROTH
@_date: 2016-08-06 12:26:46
However they don't offer margin 
@_date: 2016-04-23 13:33:06
But you can't

I dare you 
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:06:42
Bitfinex has 1 goal . To survive as the  volume exchange to  make money and attempt to pay people back so that when this the market cap of all of crypto is not 12 billion but 12 trillion they can still be in the game making a shit load of money.  That is there goal what dont you understand They realize they need to pay people back at some point to save face. They cant do this is they close down. They can only do this doing what  they do best. Create a liquid market. 
@_date: 2016-04-23 02:30:43
If you only sell stocks that go up for you, you are left with the stocks that only go down for you . Or as i call ot a box of rocks. Until you own a stock that goes up 10 fold you have not felt the power of the mkt. With that said never risk more than you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2016-04-21 19:22:36
I have owned it for almost a year it trades at premium . Trades at a premium however it moves hand in hand with btc
@_date: 2016-04-23 13:32:43
@_date: 2016-04-21 19:58:36
Yes correct until 
@_date: 2016-04-23 10:59:43
Yes however it's been in the works for  4 years .and it Will not be out when the system still has congestion and can't handle wall street volume 
@_date: 2016-04-23 02:28:19
When it's going up it can have premiums when it's going down it can have a discount. It trades like margined btc.

@_date: 2019-07-03 11:35:11
The funny thing is you will all look back in 4 years and wish you bought now.
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:17:20

you have never been more wrong I am sorry. I have been trading markets since 1991. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 19:56:15
Funny because when I first saw it I new it would moon many times and still will. I also knew to store it in a paper wallet. It takes market experience to regonize what is truely happening and ignore the fud 
@_date: 2018-03-24 20:50:25
its the same old story for those people ....
@_date: 2018-03-24 19:54:00
Investors most dangerous words are "I missed it" the funny thing is most people reading this think they missed it. They could not be farther from the truth. There is so much ahead for Bitcoin people will be saying they missed it still in 10 years 
@_date: 2017-09-08 23:22:48
Because you can't do it. I guarantee it. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 00:07:10
Well if you have not had experience in other types of markets and the shinanigans that go on you would not know what to look for unfortunately. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 23:15:07
Junk 
@_date: 2018-04-07 23:15:51
Unstable or only goes up for 9 years. Guess it depends on how you look at it. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 00:00:37
So 1 year ago today we were around 1100 usd. Thus us perfectly normal movement for any new asset in a world market. Study and new market over the last 1000 years.

The wink etf is at least a year away if not 2
@_date: 2016-05-11 16:04:03
Think about it. How does one balance the etf with buying and selling on a daily basis? They would not use bitfinex. Finra will demand a new York approved exchange  with volume to support
@_date: 2016-05-11 14:37:32
After Gemini had the liquidity to handle it I would guess and we are not close to that 
@_date: 2016-05-11 01:35:46
Were is the rumor coming from do you have proof 
@_date: 2016-05-11 15:46:52
OK what is the symbol on the us exchange then so I can have btc liquid in my irA
@_date: 2016-05-11 15:19:14
Not until Gemini has liquidity to handle the whole country buying the etf 
@_date: 2016-05-11 16:19:19
You right but we want the average Joe at fidelity to invest in it etc....
@_date: 2016-05-11 17:07:19
It will get done here and it will be huge 
@_date: 2016-05-11 15:45:59
I don't agree with that. Finra is going to want a liquid mkt to settle the etf on daily 
@_date: 2019-05-03 22:44:04
Welcome to the club!  Bitcoin changed my life. Hit me up if you need help
@_date: 2016-05-11 15:19:38
