How nuts?

Thanks I guess the same too. To tell the truth I tried my luck twice during those crazy ups and downs, once I gained 0.3 btc and the other day I lost 0.2 btc. But that was just pure gambling. So I was just wondering how can one can maximize their winning chances. It looks like it's better just to forget my coins for some time again

I would appreciate your help. I bought bitcoin when the price was around 15k. I was planning for the relatively long term investment and not daily trading. The maket went downhill and I decided to forget about my bitcoin till at least i get my money back. Now I missed the 14k price peak, otherwise I think I would have sold. Watching all those hourly ups and downs I started to think that I can get some of my money back. However, I'm very far from doing educated guesses and unfortunately I don't have the time to learn about all the details. My questions, do you advice that I go with some daily trading? Secod question, where can I find good educated advices for buying and selling from experienced ppl? Please advice some resources like subreddits, Twitter accounts, chatting channels,... I know that no body can predict the prices accurately, but at least they wouldn't be as blind as me. Thanks

I have already. I bought them blindly at high price and now I wish I can get some money back with short term trading. But I'm far from have required knowledge nor I have time to acquire it. So I'm asking if there are places where I can find people who have better knowledge than me sharing their advicea
