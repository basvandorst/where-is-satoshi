Misinformed like your opinion on the Obama bailouts or the Russian hacking that literally did happen so much we passed a bill on it?
And I'm living in the USA paying taxes, so my opinion will count when I'm a citizen won't it? Oh of course not, xenophobic racist fucks like you will say "you're not a real citizen". And I'm from the UK, there are a lot of things there way better than America, you've not got a fucking clue and you keep showing that. You are a disgusting person, for your sake i hope we never meet

He actually meant you, oh account that is 2 months old and has a post history full of anti-Bitcoin comments. Yeah, you're a real person aren't you?
Anything can drop big time, the stock market has done it more than once...

Haaa you're so predictable.
So, if the Russian interference didn't happen, why did both parties make a bipartisan bill imposing sanctions on Russia specifically for interfering with the election which Trump then signed? Lookup the Countering America's Adversaries Act signed by the cheeto in August 2017. Bet your fox news didn't cover that. Just like they don't cover the Mueller indictment.
Yes Hillary was a bad candidate, I'd have voted for Gary Johnson if i could (I'm not even a citizen so the joke's on you), but anyone would have been better than Trump.
You're so predictable with your replies though, you can't help but mention:
HILLARY  
KILLARY  
EMAILS OH THE EMAILS WAAAH  
MOM'S BASEMENT  
LIBTARD  
SNOWFLAKE  
PUSSY  
SOCIALISM  
COMMERNISUM  
FAKE NEWS  
now do go away you racist homophobic Russian troll.

The natural comeback for a comment i didn't make?
Your logic is astounding. Anyway, I don't think you're a real account as nobody could be such a horiffic person. It's like you're just trying to get a reaction out of people esp. as you're not making any sense. After all, your account stinks of Russian troll as you're 29 days old
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:35:44
America right there. Zero accountability for those who almost screwed us all. Meanwhile in Iceland they put all the bankers in jail, rewrote their Constitution so it couldn't happen again... Damn socialist countries!

Define retards?
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:17:37
When did i ever say crime and IQ are low in religious states you moron?
And remember when you literally called Obama a "soap chewing ape" you racist fuck? Is this your life, goading people?
And you'd be mad if some Russian troll accounts were destroying society so much that they affect the outcome of a presidential election and are pushing us to civil war.

The US? I'm a Brit so it's all good. TBH it gets a bit colder, but it's not as long. It's tshirt weather from like April to Nov.
Do you have a VISA already sorted? It you're looking for residency without being married to a citizen or permanent resident, having a desirable skill is a big plus.
My advice is to have lots of ��, don't get sick as my pay is better here than back home but I've got a lot less disposable income. The only real plus i can come up with here that the UK doesn't have is being able to carry a tool for self-defence. If you have the option of moving to Aus, NZ, Canada, France, etc. I'd seriously consider that above anything else.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:32:07
You do also realize that you also take my money?
And you use the free market and see how that works.
When you're 65+, go to an insurance provider (well there'll be just one choice then because of the free market), make sure they get no government funding of any sorts, don't use any collective bargaining, and see how you get on trying to buy good, cheap insurance with the complications of being old.
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:18:13
You lost any shred of credibility you may have still kept when you used the racist phrase "soap chewing ape" you racist cunt. You just further the stereotype that Republicans are racist
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:54:30
Haaaa snowflake Conservative who thinks capitalism and the free market is so great that we don't actually use it here, just shows how ignorant he is to facts.
Let's look at some of the BIGGEST bailouts in US history:
AIG - Sept 2008
Bear Stearns - April 2008
Fannie Mae - summer 2008
Freddie Mac - summer 2008
How did Obama bailout these companies before he was president???

And if socialism is so bad, don't ever use Medicare when you retire, Tricare/VA, call 911, put your kids in public school...
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:37:12
I always mention this when smug Americans say "other countries are jelly of our capitalist system, it works so well, socialism sucks azz".
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:28:53
The fact you think you don't receive any benefits shows how you need to do some reading. As i just said and am having to say again, do you have kids in school, have healthcare through an insurer, does that healthcare provider get federal subsidies (yes), do you have a 911 service in yoir area? What do you call those? I'd call them socialised benefits.
And the lack of mobility i would agree with, but the free market isn't the solution. Privitise everything e.g. fire service... So, you've not paid your last bill, so they let your house burn
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:35:01
Oh it's you again. Are you just a twat who likes to goad people with their ignorant PoV or are you just some twat in Russia trying to make America fall apart from the inside?
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:44:39
That is true yes, but seeing a load of computer things and saying "weed factory" wouldn't cut da mustard
@_date: 2017-11-23 11:27:12
Drugs would need bags of white powder or cannabis growing... Tax evasion, nah bra, mining BTC means you have a digital currency at that point. You've not gained any income or sold any yet... Even so, that's an IRS job not your local PD.

If something sounds too unbelievable, then check and double check. One site people kept posting after the Texas shooting was used a lot, about how he was an ISIS fighter. First link I clicked on the page aside from that was about how Kanye West is now Secretary of the Interior. People posting it like ot was a real site
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:39:10
Confiscated because suspected criminal activity? What criminal activity are they saying is going on? If they're stealing elec or suspect they are, then fine. But if the bill's being paid...
@_date: 2018-03-02 03:24:14
SOME taxation is theft
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:49:52
So how do you stop people from continuing to do damage to society? Make them promise not to murder anyone else?  
Maybe we shouldn't be putting people in prison for cannabis, but more serious stuff of course.
@_date: 2018-03-02 05:10:44
So you think paying for your local fire service is wrong? ��
@_date: 2018-03-02 03:22:58
And rightly so, they earn billions a year and therefore pay more? The question is the percentage of tax they ultimately pay. I may pay $1M tax this year, i paid so much! Oh wait, i earned $100M, so I've paid FAR less than most.  
I don't know why people keep saying this, it's crap the right keep pushing
@_date: 2018-03-02 05:57:40
We were talking about the fire service? Was it because i made a valid point so you went totally off track?  
And welfare given out indiscriminately is wrong, someone in genuine need is okay. And by the same logic, I hope you don't use medicare when you're over 65 too, because you know, hypocrisy?  
But yes, endless wars in the Middle East are wrong
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:56:37
I'd say yes. I can't murder the public if I'm inside a prison. And you don't think there's a deterrent factor.  
If punishments don't stop people commiting more crimes, then why have any criminal law?
@_date: 2018-03-02 05:16:49
So, behind on your bills and your house burns because you're not up to date?  
Or i have fire service at my house, but you don't, so my house eventually burns down because yours is left to burn and it's right next to mine?
See how ridiculous that sounds?
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:59:21
Yed, get rid of it because people will just break it anyway? Make it so theft, rape and murder has absolutely no punishment!
@_date: 2018-03-02 06:35:04
SOME of it isn't a tribute, some is necessary.  
e.g. prisons, a public service, running them for-profit with a private company is a huge conflict of interest
@_date: 2018-03-02 06:13:51
I've not got a massive problem with that. Unnecessary spending of taxes I have e.g. endless wars or ineffective border walls

Invest in Bitcoin and Ethereum
@_date: 2017-10-11 23:37:17
One of BTCs biggest flaws though is the occasional backlog of transactions and the fact that i can only do a certain amount of transactions a minute. It's just not fast enough. I love it, but i think that it's not going to be on top forever. Ethereum might be

That's great, but spread it around buddy. Start a 401K, chip in to that a bit, when you get a mortgage, overpay each month, doesn't have to be much... Buy some stocks and later bonds too, you know - all your eggs in one basket?
