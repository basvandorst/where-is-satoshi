No it's not. They literally have all the same problems as coinbase. I love when people like this say that because then I know you for sure have no clue what you're talking about
@_date: 2018-01-20 00:18:11
No they're just letting better more optimized altcoins take over while bitcoins market share drops 
@_date: 2018-01-20 00:13:02
The shitcoin that has features that Bitcoin is having to rely on second layers to fix? Sounds really shitty
@_date: 2018-01-20 00:10:27
But other coins already have lightning fast transactions for cheap...
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:48:10
What he means though is eventually it just hits 0

How exciting, a billboard that shows there's no more Bitcoin to be mined!
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:06:03
People will say Gemini but they have all the same issues. None of these companies we're prepared for the influx of traffic. Up to 100k new people a day for some of these places
@_date: 2018-01-20 00:15:21
If bch is 2009 tech what does that make Bitcoin? 1980s tech? 
Bch is faster and cheaper than butcoin... And you're insulting it. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:09:08
I legitimately audibly laughed out loud as I read his comment. So much misinformation. It's embarrassing it's even upvoted. I need a new subreddit to talk about Bitcoin, these people are delusional
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:50:57
I think that was his point though. I read over at there's already one wallet that does this. Can't remember who for the life of me but once it's working 100% I imagine it will help whatever coin it was for
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:53:45
There's been 8 since 1980. Not exactly uncommon
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:58:35
 Coinbase is FDIC insured and US regulated. OP will be able to get his money back but it will take some effort.
Just FYI this happens ALL the time with coinbase and every other crypto exchange in existence. The amount of new people coming in is absurd and these companies weren't ready for the surge that hit. Usually this happens when people transfer their wire. Fiat gets tied up ALL THE TIME. Especially when it's over 10k, and I guarantee that's part of the issue here
If you're going to wire your money, coinbase is at least the most well known for resolving these issues. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 20:07:06
This problem didn't just start to exist today. I'm curious why it's January 2018 and we still have this issue, while other coins have solved it long ago. If you want your btc to be worth something you should be angry about it. Right now the only reason we're number one is because of our name. That's fucking scary to me

Sandstorm. Great flick directed by Darude
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:02:30
Literally every exchange in the universe has these problems. Fiat gets tied up all the time, especially amounts of 10k 
I've shifted over 20k through coinbase and never had any issues
Plus it seems like a long list, but the people who have used it and never had an issue don't make posts on Reddit. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:04:44
Comparing coinbase to bitconnect makes you a verified idiot
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:47:21
The other side of the story is OPs name didn't match. I guarantee OP is lying. Coinbase has no reason to steal funds. He probably tried to wire money from his mom's account or some shit
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:01:16
Do you get a shiver with all the other coins that manage to do this on their first layer?
@_date: 2018-01-20 19:54:17


@_date: 2018-01-20 18:49:14
Yea everyone wants a decentralized currency until they don't
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:47:23
It means people are trying really hard to tell themselves 500bn leaving the market is a-ok
Do yourself a favor and look at the btc price chart. Look where btc was 200 days ago

Nope lol. So much for yesterday's circlejerk. It didn't improve anything
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:27:25
Why would they need lightning when they already solved the fee and slow confirmations using Satoshi's solution
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:25:58
Yet that's what Satoshi wanted...
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:53:13
Meh. Reddit is only a tiny percentage of those transactions. Not only that, but a crypto that requires a sticky because fees are enormous, it's not good for your crypto in the first place. No joke guys it might be time to invest in alts if you haven't already, btc devs are holding crypto back
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:28:31
But for the cost of one transaction fee you can the storage to fit those larger blocks

Not only that, the comment seems old. 138k unconfirmed? Last time I checked it was almost a quarter of a million
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:31:47
We're more than just some years away honestly. Scammy exchanges are still a huge issue, there's still some major humps besides just high fees and slow confirmations
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:25:16
TIL talking about high fees and slow confirmations makes you well informed on Bitcoin Core
Actually yea, that makes sense
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:45:45
This is fucking hilarious that this is downvoted. Guy posts something that is a real problem and gets downvoted like hell. The whole point of this post is about lightning network getting tested to fix the exact problem he was downvoted for talking about.
Take your greed caps off for a moment guys and realize Bitcoin won't go any further if the devs don't get their heads out of their asses, and fast. When Bitcoin has higher fees than a bank of America account, you're gonna have a bad time
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:18:59
Not if confidence drops at the same rate. Good luck getting people to buy into something that was exploited
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:17:07
Hey pretty sure some of us are here for just that - making a few hundred at a time. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 03:45:34
Good luck. Yes Theory tried for just 24 hours and it was a struggle. They eventually had to cheat, TWICE
@_date: 2018-11-27 17:06:56
Yup, further proof OP is clueless.
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:57:09
No offense but you're a dolt OP. We haven't hit the floor yet.
There's also no guarantee Bitcoin ever gets the amount of hype it received last year. People bought in and it cost them 30 dollars just to transfer it and it took over 24+ hours to get there. The people who had that as their first experience won't come back. Then you have the people who knew that wasn't normal, but bought in due to FOMO. Now they've anywhere from 60% - 95% of their investment if they listened to this sub and hodled on.
The rich already got richer. They were spending all sorts of money astroturfing Reddit and Twitter.
Then there's all that investment money. Which is all mostly pulled out, and if it isn't already it will be when they file for bankruptcy.
The majority of the money that entered the market last year won't do it again anytime soon unless there's a real high chance they can rehype the market, which will be 4-8 times harder to repeat.
Bitcoin is not a wise investment. Have people gotten rich off of it? Yes. People get rich off bad investments elsewhere to, but most don't. 
It's a dated tech, that will be taken over soon enough. Last year was peak Myspace, the coming years Facebook will show up and we'll all laugh about that time "Myspace" hit 20k.
@_date: 2018-11-29 22:21:22
Right but I think this quote can be seen two ways. Your way, and the "it's not doing as well as   it should be because it's not and they're doing what they can to prevent it from doing well"
@_date: 2018-11-27 17:12:07
Well at least he got one thing right, Bitcoin is indeed outdated tech and the crypto scene will be entirely different in 20 years
@_date: 2018-11-26 16:49:22
You were saying?
@_date: 2018-11-27 02:32:27
Enjoy pump and dump schemes and scams galore then. You either have oversight or you live with a market full of manipulation. 
I know in a perfect world Bitcoin wouldn't be regulated, but communism works in a perfect world. A perfect world we don't live in.

Digital gold ya goof. It's essentially a middle man to fiat at the moment. It's slowly becoming currency but not quite there yet
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:07:43
Why on Earth would you ever give Reddit money lol
@_date: 2018-11-30 16:41:39
Why the fuck is this gay ass post on the front page? Are we now?
@_date: 2018-11-28 06:33:43
But you hodl it like gold. Which is technically money but not really anymore
@_date: 2018-11-28 03:44:03
Oh hush, I'll be a millionaire any day now from my 200 dollar investment. Just need to whole world to change their mind
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:47:24
A year ago today wasn't the first time Bitcoin ever hit 10k so it's weird OP is even making this post
@_date: 2018-11-26 16:56:52
Yup. There's no reason to believe we've hit the floor yet. That's why I couldn't stand so many people here saying they were putting more money into it. Lots of delusion around here lately.
Don't get me wrong, I hope to God Bitcoin recovers and goes back up. I'd much rather be wrong and miss out, than be right and people lose a bunch of money. I just don't have a lot of faith in people getting excited about Bitcoin again. Many showed up, and saw a 30 dollar transfer fee and a 24+ hour transfer time after being told Bitcoin was fast and practically free. I doubt many of those people stumble back in. Too many people lost out big
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:44:23
Lol you're delusional. People aren't buying Bitcoin because they're realizing the us dollar is easy to forge
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:09:28
Because you're on where misinformation thrives
@_date: 2018-12-13 16:41:12
By posting this in this sub you're behaving like a sheep OP

Go watch a movie with a shitty actor.
While I agree actors aren't the only talented people on a set, an actor not being able to sell a performance is one of the very first things that will ruin the immersion
@_date: 2018-12-12 17:12:11
Maybe you should do your research. Reddit has been infiltrated by pro-iran influence for quite awhile now. The most recent Reddit security post was about how they caught and banned a bunch of them but think there's WAY more still flying under the radar. Reddit rarely announces their vulnerabilities like that so the fact they came to the community for help shows the issue got so out of control they needed extra help bringing all the accounts to their attention
And funny enough, most of the accounts they did catch posted heavily to @_date: 2018-12-19 17:11:13
lol are you saying because of this little run it won't now? Give it time, these little bump ups occur every few weeks just for it to fall further after
@_date: 2018-12-19 16:52:17
Oh cool thanks for confirming you are clueless
@_date: 2018-12-19 17:08:42
Is 3 weeks really that long ago?
@_date: 2018-12-19 16:54:28
Yea that's the biggest lie I've read on Reddit so far today.
And that's saying a lot because I was just over on @_date: 2018-12-12 17:06:30
Except it is an AMG
@_date: 2018-12-04 04:52:26
Damn I thought all the stoners in high school were getting high off hash. I didn't realize they were actually mining bitcoins
@_date: 2018-12-12 17:05:13
@_date: 2018-12-11 16:53:27
Oh people bought the dip, back when it dipped to 16k
@_date: 2018-12-19 17:14:26
Are you guys actually high? It shoots up a decent percent every few weeks. Then it falls. Everyone just had this conversation a couple weeks ago, I'm pretty sure it was even the same guy who said we were given a black friday deal for getting Bitcoin at 3700 when it shot up to 4300 shortly after
@_date: 2018-12-13 03:15:46
If Bitcoin didn't fail so miserably back in late 2017 and early 2018 I'd say you're correct. However, we had a HUGE influx of new people enter the market who were greeted with the dreaded "30 for 30" (30 hours to transfer funds for 30 dollar fee)
Too many people were simply introduced to Bitcoin at a time it showed it's biggest flaw. I don't see Bitcoin being able to get the hype train back on track. I'm hoping to god it does, but the fact of the matter is Bitcoin is a super risky investment and you need to be aware of that. It showed itself as an outdated tech that can't keep up with high use, and lightning network doesn't change that unlike many seem to think. At the end of the day, you have to buy in on-chain.
Could there be another spike? I hope so. Bitcoin won't ever die as long as there's a community of people who support it, but that doesn't mean it will ever come to be a top currency, especially as tech quickly outpaces it's capabilities
@_date: 2018-12-11 16:44:13
Not sure why you guys keep talking about him when it's a pretty general agreement Bitcoin has gone of course of what he wanted it to be
@_date: 2018-12-12 17:06:49

You missed this guy? He was just on the front page a week ago heading the other direction...
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:05:53
lol that cunt didn't set us back several years. While he might be a cunt, he didn't set us back years. Things aren't THAT vulnerable. That's cute you think that though
@_date: 2018-12-10 17:13:46
This sub is full of prime investment advice.
I remember when Bitcoin went from 20k to 16k and everyone here was buying the dip. Think of how rich they'll be. Most people said Bitcoin would be 100k by the end of 2018 so they're going to be LOADED!!
@_date: 2018-12-10 16:56:10
And sadly Reddit deleted the sub because new Reddit bends the knee to corporate pressure.
Fake photoshops of celebrities are allowed but the second it crosses over to video it becomes a super scary thing for some reason.
People say "think of how it could be used against you in court!" But how is a good fake Photoshop picture any different? There's forensic ways to spot them, and most deepfakes are currently way easier to spot even  without forensics
I really think the tech caused way too much of an overblown reaction, especially since it's been possible to do this for a long time, the only difference is it took less work and less time
@_date: 2018-12-10 17:07:18
Because of his hand, excessive suspension drop and many other mistakes made. I get what you're saying, however in this instance it's definitely not spliced in
@_date: 2018-12-19 17:09:46
Selling it 200 dollars below asking price is what's stupid
@_date: 2018-12-11 16:54:35
Yup, nothing like moving your coin on a high tx day.
