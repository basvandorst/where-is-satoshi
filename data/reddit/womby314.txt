You have the linguistic eloquence of Dennis Rodman. And much like him, I don't think you should ever visit Asia, as you'll probably end up calling half the population "dumb whores." (which, by the way, is ACTUALLY degrading to women).

So I assume the next time you hear a woman on the street talk about a "hot dude," you're going to pull her aside and explain to her how degrading that is to men and what a bad person she is.

As a foreign teacher currently working in Malaysia, this would promptly make me leave. I'm already unhappy that the exchange rate against the dollar is rapidly getting worse every month (partly due to a bunch of corrupt nonsense the PM is involved in), but if you try to hold my money hostage, I'm out.

Most Thai people own a bit of gold, even if they are fairly poor. There's a gold shop on practically every corner. So they're a bit less trusting of their currency than people in the West. That being said, I don't know anyone here who has even heard of bitcoin.

Not actually true (I live here also), though people might look at you angrily. What IS true is that I could be thrown in jail if it was discovered that I upvoted flamingboard's comment (which I didn't, for the record.) Same with "liking" such comments on facebook.

When random crackheads are savvy enough to steal bitcoins from your car, only then will we have succeeded. Until then, soldier on!

I happen to own a very lucrative business transporting people to the moon with my own flatulence. We accept bitcoins and also hot pockets.

Yep, confirmed. I'm from the US but living in Thailand, and have been trying to buy on coinbase all week as it's the only way. Click refresh click refresh click refresh...
