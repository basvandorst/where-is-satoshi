I'm not necessarily worried about millions of "shitcoins." Even Andreas said that in the end there will be millions of different cryptocurrency. The thing I worry about are Trojan Horse cryptos. Cryptos that appear to mimic the positive traits of bitcoin and other good cryptos, but in reality contain a backdoor to allow surveillance/censorship by interested parties. Even if the code was open-source and technical experts would be able to see the difference, the general public would not. They could easily spread misinformation and the average person would have no idea not to believe it unless they spent months researching it. I hope I'm wrong, but that would definitely take down other legitimate cryptos as long as the trojan crypto had institutional backing.

They used to say the same thing about the internet. It was thought to be impossible to censor and regulate. If there is literally any way for Corporate cronies to ruin bitcoin, they will.

If we develop a computer capable of cracking open bitcoin, the value of bitcoin might be the least of our worries. All current encryption everywhere will be useless. It will be a huge disruption.

Corporate cronies will find some way to ruin it. Just like they are ruining the internet right now. When the Internet first took off, people thought it would bring on a new age of democracy and freedom because it couldn't be regulated or controlled. Now look where we are.

Bitcoins main value comes from decentralization. This allows people in developing countries to use banking technology without having access to banking infrastructure. A centralized cryptocurrency is useless. So they can try, but no one has any incentive to use it.  Central banks will keep add restrictions and rules to their cryptocurrency in order to cement their control over it. Before you know it, it will just be regular money again.

No way to predict. Healthy growth tends to be steady paced. When it rides up like this, people suspect a bubble--which is what has happened in the past.

Exactly, some people were speculating that it was going to be a flying car too. It was a big deal because it was the year 2000 and we were "supposed to have flying cars by now." Ridiculous.
