This way of gaining hurts the market because if all do the same, boat will sink. But I understand that selling hight and buying low could mean great profits, but consider also that if you're inexperienced, you will probably sell at 13k and buy back at 13.5k because you have chosen the wrong moment.
Reddit is full of stories like this.
The only time that I have tried it, I have gained 50$ (with 700$ selling) but lost 3 hours of my life and a lot of hairs :)
I will never do it again,just hodl and smile in face of scared weak hands

Buy now and sell on 31/12, you probably will end with 8 Mil. After that send the advice fee to my wallet, a 30% of your gain will be enough..!

We have crushed during the return to earth of january and now we must repair the Falcon B, but seems that our supporters have finished the money to invest... ��

Saying that 1MB will be enough in the future is like saying that 640kb of ram will be enough for all. In 20-30 years 1GB will be like 1MB of today, more or less 
@_date: 2018-08-15 16:57:56
That's the point, but before or after they must came. From my POW, the problem with BCH is political/ethical/leadership rather than technical. With the transaction level of december, 1MB wasn't enough and any other scaling solutions will not be available or adopted before the next bullrun.
With a bullrun to 50K, Btc transactions will be approved in more than 24H even with high fees, and fees will probably be over 25$... Not a great result for a global coin.
Lightning will be probably adopted in late 2019 or 2020, so now it is not a solution

Probably in 80 years 1GB will be the same as today 1MB. The power grows, the network grows and the storage grows. Say that 1MB will be enough in the future is like sayng that 640KB of ram will be enough for all... ��

It will be worse if you get the key of the Satoshi's wallet... If you touch them you will have all the police under your home in few minutes, and at the same time the entire market will crash in the fear of a giga-dump!!
So you have one million of Bitcoin that you can't touch at all ������

Transfer your Bitcoin to a local wallet and retransfer them to a remote one. This will guide your IP for the second transaction and makes you more free.
The good thing of a full node is that you are the first node to broadcast the transaction and your IP will remain inside your node

We have robots, computers, cars, smartphones, plains, spaceships, but sending money with my bank to another country takes 3-5 days and can be done only during working hours...
@_date: 2018-06-10 07:15:43
Most, not mine... Mine takes 2 days to make a SEPA transfert... So non SEPA would only be worse

He speaks about the revolution and the technology that will drive it. If you have the same feeling, the price will not matter in the short period

Segwit and low volumes help bitcoin to lower fees.
If volumes will reach again levels of December expect the fees to fly high, lower than December thanks to segwit but always too much high for small transactions. LN has too few adoption level to impact in fees

The times that I have checked was European and Asian dumping and USA pumping... (I'm Italian, so not proud of European dumps...)

If you are and hodler, just don't watch price till December 2018, and in the early of January probably sell because all will be selling because of January crash fear. The fear of January crash that will make bitcoin crash for the next years. Till then, relax

Wait for adoption. Right now every crypto is difficult to buy and to use. We use too much technical terms for the middle man, and also for the tech addicted is not so intuitive... This is not the way a revolution will spread, but it's the way it will start.
Forget about value for a moment and consider the difficulties that you have found the first time you used it. This is the greatest limit in adoption. The scalability comes after, but, as the Bitcoin is tech focused and not user focused, the developers will continue to drive in the wrong direction.
When they will be confident with the technology and will change their focus on GUI and end user, the adoption will starts.
Till then, accumulating can be a smart decision or a dumb one, but it's only a your decision what way to follow.

From my knowing the minimum number of miners must be 3, because with 2 there isn't the possibility to create a trust (each miner could doublespend and the other can't verify)

My money will not be available anymore in bank soon as every month is a new dip and a new bags filling for me. If it continue like that for all the 2018, at the eoy I will have only BTC!! :)
