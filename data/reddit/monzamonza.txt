Not too shabby for a pumpkin right?

Nice pumpkin. Mine's not so pretty but I did manage to carve 28 alphanumeric case sensitive characters into one...

Please, Mr. Economics PhD, Explain to me how the banks are the reason for all of our economic problems. Try to explain in it a way that doesnt reveal that you have no idea what youre talking about

this is simply false. the "tokens" (XRP) are only used as an anti-spamming mechanism to prevent DDoS attacks. They can also be thought of as the cost of a transaction, which ensures in some measure that the network doesnt get hi-jacked by HFT's. The more expensive XRP becomes, the less attractive it is for businesses to use the network to transact. For this reason RippleLaps has an interest in keeping the price of XRP down, not up.

hey 12 year old, tell me again why you think Barry Silbert and Andreessen Horowitz should be thrown in jail...
Kids these days are so edgy.

not completely centralized. Every Gateway operates its own blockchain and thus performs its own clearing at cost to itself (which makes sense, cuz institutions make money off of transactions, they should have to pay to perform them) RL is just subsidizing the process in the early stages to help gateways get on their feet.

Ripple's business plan is not to get you to migrate to Ripple. They're going after the guys who transact the most, Banks, Currency Dealers, and Remittance Handlers. They aren't going after end-users.

it's threads like this that give Bitcoiners a bad name. They all come off as conspiracy theorist/anarchists who want to destroy anything that remotely steals worship away from their idol, 
the distributed blockchain specifically used for transactions" 
@_date: 2015-03-17 12:30:53
its completely possible to operate Ripple without Fractional Reserve. You can start a gateway with a 100% reserve ratio at any time. Go ahead.

actually its inversely related to the bitcoin price.

First and foremost, you're correct: Gateways are 3rd parties and thus are potential weak points. The important question to ask is, "Do the benefits of an oligarchical model outweigh the risk?" Time and time again, the market has spoken and decided, yes, its worth it. Look at the banking system, look at Coinbase! Any Bitcoiner in this thread that uses coinbase doesnt have a leg to stand on calling out Ripple for quasi-centralization. 
Without big exchanges like coinbase you wouldnt even know what your BTC is worth! THATS a point of failure right there! 
It's asking too much to want the financial system to be entirely p2p. That being said, it's a cool idealization to strive towards, less centralization means a more democratic price-discovery process and less weighted manipulation.
The question you should ask is "Does ripple create a more democratic financial system than the one we have now?" The answer is yes. Would Bitcoin? Also yes. Which is more likely to be implemented first though, Definitely Ripple.

These are all good points brother, but let me introduce you to the real world:
Re, Freeze:
The Glass Steagall Act requires that all financial institutions have the ability to freeze accounts of suspected terrorists. You cant do business in this country without being able to do it. Grow up.
Printing Money:
It's completely possible to have a non-fractional reserve gateway on Ripple. It's called Bitstamp. Ripple simply allows one to issue derivatives on top of other assets (whether they be currency, bitcoin, or gold) in order to trade them freely, on a blockchain.

Not everyone is an ideologue like you. AH is not trying to 
"take the man down, bro!.. Fuck Corporations and the banking system mann"
Grow the fuck up. He's an investor. He sees a risk/rewardopportunity. Are all Bitcoiners this self-absorbed?
@_date: 2015-03-17 12:33:18
Ripple doesnt "want to piss on bitcoin" Ripple allows people to trade bitcoin derivatives at a fraction of the cost/time of trading bitcoins themselves.
