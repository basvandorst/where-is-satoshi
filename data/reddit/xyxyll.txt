Keep in mind that many types of employees cannot legally be paid as 1099 contractors.  The job responsibilities and titles matter tremendously, and a company can get into major trouble with state labor departments if they pay employees as a contractor.
Another curious question... what does this mean for unemployment?  Generally umemployment benefits are proportional to the amount of money you make per hour in a job.  If paid in bitcoin, I wonder how that affects things.

And yet Bitcoin's momentous hashrate, which dwarfs all the world's supercomputers, tackles nothing more than some transaction processing and a ton of useless calculations just to be difficult.  I can't accept that it is an environmentally-friendly system yet.  It's ridiculously inefficient.

Yep.  It's painless.  They make it very straight-forward.  I copy/pasted the provided bitcoin address into my wallet and sent.  Immediately synced with the blockchain and once the confirmations were in, the invoice was delivered.

Yeah, but as soon as Bitcoin's transaction backlog problems are resolved, then altcoins have no added benefit anymore. I'm all for Litecoin doing well; I mined for months, but as soon as they let ASICs step in, they doomed themselves. From my perspective, the moment Bitcoin's fixed, everyone is going to short Litecoin for Bitcoin. Do you think differently? I want to understand why. Please let me know.

I also ran into the exact same problem with Coinbase today.  Nearly screwed me over.  Took about 4hr to receive.  Hopefully things settle out after the holiday.
