Gox remains unresolved. That's why I'm still sidelined at least. A failure or acquisition will have profound affects on the market. I'd prefer to not take that gamble.

Too bad the 20% off Xbox One plus two free games did expire yesterday...
@_date: 2014-08-01 23:41:32
True, but 20% was an exceptional discount for paying in bitcoin.

It's definitely hasn't come into its prime. Developers are struggling to get games running at 1080, while on the ps4 there doesn't seem to be any problem. That and there really aren't any next Gen exclusives that would motivate me to upgrade from my 360.

Sorry but I'm calling this out as a shill. 8 months of reddit and one of only 2 posts is to draw awareness to a service that itself was just posted to this sub 2 days ago by a fresh account? Smells fishy.

Annnnnnnd Bitcoinwisdom is down....

Rumors are circulating that there are at least a couple potential buyers for gox in the works. Personally, I think some of this rebound is people speculating on an acquisition and the positive message that would send to the market. My money says announcement of an actual failure will drive the market down, much in the same way that people knew gox was headed into the dirt, but when they actually suspended trading the market took a nose dive.

Are you a bot or just so autistic that you respond almost the same thing to every one of this users identical comments.
@_date: 2013-10-22 06:43:29
I've been waiting for you to make an appearance.
@_date: 2013-10-23 07:06:55
As a Coinbase employee ([Hi Charlie Lee]( is this confirmation that you are now using MtGox as a reference point for your buy price despite their well publicized and current issues? Ex: [5+ week withdrawal queue as of Oct 16.] ( Can you shed some light into the rationale of moving away from Bitstamp within the last week?
@_date: 2013-10-18 19:30:41
Good Luck with the Exchange! Site looks good, just need some orders on them books.

This doesn't make much sense, they were fine through the peaks of trading and now when it seems like the panic has leveled off they go down? huh....
@_date: 2013-10-23 23:47:01
They have changed their policies several times without notifying their customer base. The most recent sham was that adding a credit card backup would allow for instant buy, which was then changed to require level 2 verification within a matter of days.

wut. I just double checked my gmail and I received no such email. I certainly hope that information of that gravity isn't something that you have to opt-in for...

I have a strong suspicion that NOW would be the appropriate time to move your BTC out of US based wallet services.
@_date: 2013-10-23 06:34:05
Most of its matches internally? And where would you suppose they get that inventory from? Don't be ridiculous, Coinbase is a middleman. Even supposing that they are sitting on a huge wealth of bitcoin, when that supply runs out does the business just cease to exist? No, they buy bitcoins on the market like everyone else for the going rate and charge their 1% in/out for the convenience of funding options and not having to deal with an exchange.
And now lets talk about Gox... Its fairly well known that Gox does not serve as an accurate representation of the true market value due to the HUGE issues (delays) with withdrawing funds from their accounts if you even can. Hence, fiat in Gox is worth relatively less than fiat in other exchanges. Lack of liquidity means a higher price just for the privilege of moving your funds to an exchange where you can actually make a withdrawal.

You do realize that getting verified means waiting 30 days after your first purchase, right? It's not something you can just do.

set bitcoinwisdom.com to a 1 minute interval and watch your interest in the real world disappear.

Can anyone point me to the section which stipulates that a conversion into local currency MUST take place? The summary makes no reference to a conversion requirement and instead seems focused on mandatory disclosures to the consumer and remediation/investigation of transfer issues.
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:40:17
They aren't completely down, but their servers are sure struggling. I'm getting timeouts about 25% of the time.
@_date: 2013-10-23 05:04:47
They charge a fee for buying and selling and make you wait FOUR BUSINESS DAYS to touch your coins EVEN WITH A CREDIT CARD ON FILE. Oh you bought Friday night? Your coins will be delivered the following THURSDAY. Convenience is not in their vocabulary.

Can we please not relate bitcoin to the epic failure of a person that is Lindsay Lohan?

So would it be fair to say based on that graph that the current search volume is equal to roughly half of what it was at one point earlier in 2013? I'm assuming that spike corresponds with when the price hit 260 something in April.

Down as well...
Getting my trigger finger ready to buy buy buy!

Congrats, keep 'em somewhere safe.
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:27:04
Given all the news recently, I highly doubt there will be any reason for a scare sell-off. Its been all positive, except the 25% attack which has been thoroughly discredited since its publishing.

Now if they could only get their prices in line with the market. I'm not going to buy from you when your charging $6+ more than market price in addition to your fees.
Bitstamp @ 191, Coinbase @ 197... yah, no.
@_date: 2013-12-10 00:58:33
Sounds like you have a solid understanding of the challenges ahead and the experience to navigate them. Any business that incorporates Bitcoin is one that I would support. Best of luck to you.

This better be a fucking joke. I bought a not insignificant number on Thursday.
@_date: 2013-10-23 06:46:22
Its not a convenience fee. They have a fee schedule already and its 1% in/out + $.15 bank transfer. If its a "fee" it needs to be on the fee schedule so people can account for that cost. Right now its random inflation/misrepresentation of the market cost.

I asked the question directly to customer service several days ago and received this response:

Nick replied:
We base our price on the average of a variety of exchanges, so sometimes our price differs from any one particular exchange. As the price between different exchanges stabilizes, our price will be naturally self-correcting. Hope that explains!
Kind regards,

I think that you're proposing entering a market that is already incredibly over-saturated. Conventional wisdom would say that it is not wise from a business prospective.
