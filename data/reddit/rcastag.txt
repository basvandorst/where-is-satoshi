I don't think that is true.  Transactions are not even making it to the memcache

What is a better option for the testnet?

The problem is that all of us Bitcoin holders are not demanding that merchants accept payments.  When we start \(and I already do\) asking to pay with Bitcoin everywhere, the "business in the blockchain" folks will see where the business really is.

Ethereum isn't even trying to compete in the payment space.  Why are you fighting against Bitcoin?

I'd just use BRD wallet regardless.

It can't really be worth the fee to get in can it?!

Competition is great!  I agree.

No \- If Ethereum (Vitalik) was trying to compete with Bitcoin in payments the Ethereum Foundation would be working to facilitate payments make standards, .  Its crystal clear that Ethereum is meant to be a platform for applications, contracts, etc... not the payments use case.

I absolutely agree with you.  We should be getting the word out and encouraging use everywhere.

You want them to collapse?  Coinbase is the easiest way for noobs to get into Bitcoin.  I understand not liking them yourself, but toxic?

What it means is that the 'tainted' coins will be used by individuals for transactions since they won't care about where they came from.  They won't get 'cashed in' by an exchange until they are enough transactions removed to be considered 'clean'.  Maybe its 5 transactions, maybe its 10, maybe 20.  It doesn't matter, its easy to create 25 wallets and transfer around the bitcoin.  This is a hopeless strategy...
