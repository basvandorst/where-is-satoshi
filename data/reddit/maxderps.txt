I've been trying to get verified since November of last year, they just keep asking for new documents, ie. I put up bills then they want tax receipts, I give that then they need it to show to the edges, on and on and on, last I checked they wanted another copy of my driver licence because it's been so long since I originally uploaded it...  I wonder why, these guys are Fuck faces, VoS had me verified in almost no time with just bills and ID

This is rough, CAD just got to a 5 year low, it was super strong last season to.

We can poke all the fun we want, the fact that this is a publication the general public might take seriously is pretty sad

He said he sent in all the documents already, what are you talking about?
@_date: 2014-06-04 12:56:07
I had to stop reading half way through

Generally when you're sweeping a private key it's the in wallet scanner, so hopefully were a ok for the most part

What's the charge for it? Do I need a branch and account info? Haven't gotten around to adding that to the profile 
@_date: 2015-01-30 22:20:42
At least it wont be the lamb, we hope lol

I hesitated when i saw they charge $25 for an interac deposit, bit lame 
@_date: 2014-05-08 19:25:24
you sound like the bitchy guy in the room trying to explain why some guys  banal statement is totally based on a misconception that no one else really had anyway
@_date: 2015-08-04 23:51:09
That's really strange since I'm looking at my account balance in CAD right now, and by touching the balance i can change it to USD and vice versa...

Think of it as a volatile gamble/commodity, not an investment, that said, when your young is the time to diversify into high risk investments

If you're storing enough for someone to want to come after it, store the seed in a safety deposit box
@_date: 2015-03-26 22:35:23
thats strange, what method did you use?
@_date: 2015-03-06 13:51:45
Lol you best be trolling

Ahhhh ty ty, a few months back I was wondering how I  could get an HD wallet as watch only in Mycelium, now i have my answer! 
@_date: 2015-03-26 23:21:16

I assumed you were using a reputable source, but I have no clue what bit.in is personally. 
@_date: 2015-03-31 20:00:23
Depends on your banks policy towards bitcoin
@_date: 2015-10-12 20:32:48
I guess what, you meant is the post you were making directly was an example of a shitpost? seems that way
@_date: 2015-10-13 00:47:20
Your account seems to be a large collection of both lol

Anyone know if the new build is functional? Last version i tried could only pull 2 or 3 test shops 
@_date: 2015-03-23 15:16:28
My understanding was that paycoin/paybase/josh garza was a known shitcoin/scam going back like 4 months ago if not more, how is this news? 
@_date: 2015-03-30 23:15:37
fuck, i was starting to feel like I'm in the god damn twilight zone reading ops post, thank you for restoring my faith in humanity 
@_date: 2015-03-06 13:00:20
Some of the Crypto subs have just become shill after shill shit posting their shitcoins 
@_date: 2015-03-23 15:19:31
Garza did what he needed to make paycoin what it is today! How could he let it fail if all he needed was a donation from each of us! The gun was necessary, how could he collect the donations in time!?
