I won't show you my bank account because some money is missing.  
The issue will be solved. Meaning no bitcoin should be missed. It's useless to generate more panic.

It's a good morning for me ;)  
Yes you can.  
Maybe a safe way is to make a cold storage wallet:   
You can ask your customer to proceed the transaction directly on your cold storage addresses. You'll still able to see if the transaction is done, and your wallet will be safe.  
My conclusion is you can as soon as your wallet is secure enough.   
In case you need to send some bitcoins, you can still make a live encrypted wallet with few but enough funds on it for your day.  
It's a simple and not detailed explanation, but hope this help.

MtGox: don't. At the moment Bitcoin withdrawl are blocked, that's why peoples selling off on this place.  
Use Coinbase, or an other exchange place.

Why opening a thread if you're not open to discuss your subject ? You're exposed to downvotes because some peoples can be not agree with you. 
  
The thing you forget is bitcoin is a lot of money. weapons, oil, drugs, and bitcoins all exist because it's generating money.  
Peoples holding bitcoins to speculate but also because we need more and more merchant to spend them. maybe in usa you're okay with this but lots of countries are still late and awaking.  
  


  
in any stock market the money put into speculation is slightly highest than the part used in the all-day life. 99% not holding, a big part is playing them, and in something need in any market.  
no speculators, no value. or no value, no speculators, both work together. the more peoples invest, the more people try to make money, the more money will come in.  
  
every successful markets are ponzi schemes: the firsts who came in the game own.  
  
a part of what you saying is true, but it's also true in every big markets.
  
i personally trust a lot bitcoin is a fantastic money. bitcoin will not fail.  
  
i think your thread is a taunt to the community.

So much bad (dumb?) comments while they are working to resolve the issue.  
  
Blockchain.info is taking part into Gox exchange, it's a really great news. Maybe BC.info will slowly take the control of Gox (control the transactions is already a 50% of the job).    
  
I understand people lost trust in Gox. But you should be happy they are planning to open back BTC withdraw... you should be happy Gox won't be 100% Gox anymore... ?

Probably some peoples are panic selling.  
I think the others try to keep the price down. It's a crazy opportunity to play with the Bitcoin volatility. On a market the price don't matter a lot for a trader looking into profit, he is more looking at the %.  
Between $600 and $300 you have 50%. That's huge and this result is easiest to get it by selling than by buying (also more safe in this case).    
Between $600 and $550 it's ~9%. But between $350 and $300, it's ~14%. Profit is higher on bottom.  
Bigger volatility, and bigger profit. Traders saw it and took the train. They probably will do so until they can't anymore.  
Today MtGox Chart showing lots of waves:  
 - ping  gmt+1: $342  
 - pong  gmt+1: $271  (-20%)  
 - ping  gmt+1: $365  (+34%)  
 - pong  gmt+1: $303 (-17%)  
 - ping  gmt+1: $390 (+28%)  
- total %: 99 on a 12h timestamp. Today you could double your BTC (or your fiat ?) on Gox.  
Just crazy... I would be on Gox with lot of my BTC at this moment (especially on my dayoff xD).
