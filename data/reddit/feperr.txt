Hate to say it, but the iOS version seems to have a far prettier interface. I don't like the looks of the android app at all.

So, basically:
* I give them my coins
* "lock" them to euros -&gt; they sell them for euros
* while the price of bitcoin continues to rise, the make a shitton of profit
* I "unlock" my coins form euros and now have less coins
Seems legit.

You can just generate some private keys on your computer, then import them to Mycelium. This wallet app does not use change adresses so it will only ever use the ones that you tell it to.

If your physical wallet gets stolen, you are also fucked. And that's far more likely to happen.

Accepting Bitcoin in a local business is a lot easier than accepting cards. A smartphone or a PC is enough to start accepting.

I'm very glad to hear that. Thank you!

You don't lose money if they don't. It just doesn't get sent.

There are also huge hate brigades towards console gaming. In my eyes those are rather justified though.

Let's be honest here, the majority of torrent traffic is illegal anyway. If someone down- or uploading illegal content doesn't use a VPN or proxy, they are the ones to blame.

I believe a person or group smart enough to develop Bitcoin would take care of Backups.
