Someone explain the graph. Who counts as a contributor? Anyone that makes a pull requests (or gets a PR merged)? When does a person stop being a contributor?
@_date: 2018-01-22 09:28:54


That's not what you said though.

I had to search to find the most basic case without distracting lights. Still had to tape up the pretty bright power light.

I'm still having a really hard time figuring out what the picture is many to be of

What is that security picture?
@_date: 2018-09-28 21:14:08
The alert system had been removed. And for good reason too, there shouldn't be privileged users in Bitcoin that can do more than others
@_date: 2018-08-14 07:30:54


But BCH wasn't even a thing until late last year?
@_date: 2018-08-26 10:15:38


You still need the app to use it

Is the presentation about Bitcoin?
Or is this just "look, an abbreviation sometimes used here is being used in this presentation"
@_date: 2018-05-22 07:31:10


@_date: 2018-08-31 02:13:03
Are you asking yourself that? Was this and your other comment ("You mean bch or bitmain? ��") meant to be from alt accounts?
@_date: 2018-05-22 02:21:37
I've never used venmo or know anyone who has so I don't know the real value of it. But from what you describe here is just doing something that you can already do with your bank account.


Every bank I know doesn't charge anything to send to other accounts. Friends and I regularly send money to each other's accounts without any extra apps
@_date: 2018-05-22 06:43:55


That's interesting. How would you do it without venmo? Would you have to withdraw cash and give that to them?
It's probably why no one I know uses venmo here. Every bank allows free transfers with other banks

Most companies are aware that initial development costs are going to be high and to see any profit straight away is an achievement

Without seeing the code I think it's fair to assume this bot is recording messages
@_date: 2018-06-22 23:14:33


The average user doesn't care. That's still what you need to complete with

Why the fuck are people upvoting a link to another Reddit submission that's on the same subreddit and on the front page and less than 5 hours old at the time this was posted?
@_date: 2018-06-03 02:04:02
Can you think of any reasons at all why they would have the customer send you the money instead of having it sent straight to them? Why would they add an extra middleman. One that they've never met before?
This is pretty obviously a scam.

What does Bitcoin have to do with you overspending on your bank account?
@_date: 2019-02-26 09:32:05
Why use an app for some other task with a wallet tacked on? Instead of just using an app that is specifically focused on being a wallet?
@_date: 2019-02-19 22:48:08
They kind of look similar. I think that's what he means
@_date: 2019-02-09 20:15:20


But how does the dusting make a difference here? Without the dusting the transaction would still link all those inputs together just the same
@_date: 2019-02-19 06:34:16
Might be a stupid question. But why were you creating the qr codes yourself, instead of from your wallet?
@_date: 2018-11-21 01:07:18
Nope. In Australia have to pay tax on any transaction out of btc. It's rubbish
@_date: 2018-11-22 01:17:18
But it's not locked in? They can get it back out (what they haven't spent) whenever they want. Or am I misunderstanding what you mean?
@_date: 2018-03-21 01:05:54
They don't have to pay dividends with regular stocks...
@_date: 2018-11-27 21:57:56


Didn't your hear? Bitcoin isn't about having a useable asset. It's about getting rich
@_date: 2019-01-02 20:58:46
What are you even doing? Doing a transaction from yourself? Are your coins currently on an exchange? Why did you wait until now to withdraw after putting your hardware wallet in a safety deposit box?
@_date: 2018-11-21 01:12:34
Where did they say it was an investment?
@_date: 2018-11-23 21:16:20


@_date: 2018-11-20 01:36:22
Which exchanges accept lightning transactions?
@_date: 2019-01-02 23:10:23
Then it's pointless for you to be moving your coins. I think you're misunderstanding what this proof of keys thing is meant to be.
If you want to just confirm that you still have access to your keys or your backups still work then there's easier and better ways than transferring your coins to a new address
@_date: 2018-02-13 00:58:58
Anyone remember this tweet from Daniel buchner
@_date: 2018-11-21 01:20:39


Do you have a link? Honest question, don't mean to be snarky or imply you're wrong. I'm trying to search a bit now and just getting same pretty vague stuff on the ATO website
@_date: 2018-11-21 01:54:33
Cool thanks




 


This is what gets me. The only difference between these two examples is intent. Both users bought Bitcoin and used it to buy goods and services directly. Only difference is in the second example the user wanted the bitcoin to increase in value. Every action the users took is just the same.
So if OP is following these examples, then he probably should be paying tax on it.

Everyone knows that you can get by fine with one kidney, but you should note that you can also  do alright with just one lung.

Do you accept Bitcoin or do you just randomly have the logo on the box? The online order seems to only have cash and credit card
@_date: 2018-07-11 02:32:28
Why? Does it only stop being anonymous once it's decentralized and scalable?
@_date: 2018-07-17 04:12:31
An incentivized echo chamber where it costs more to have a different opinion.
That sounds like the worst

Why the fuck are you posting a screenshot of a website instead of an actual link to it
@_date: 2018-07-08 04:54:23
It's almost like there's multiple people with different thoughts and opinions posting here
@_date: 2018-04-27 07:01:22
Don't go brigading
@_date: 2018-04-30 02:25:55


Getting everyone to agree what that waiting list would be is why mining is a thing in the first place. By having that common waiting list for everyone you just loop back around to the original problem of decentralised consensus.

You think he'd be up there himself instead of paying lawyers?

It is really really hard to enter a wrong address that's still a valid address
@_date: 2018-12-17 07:07:09
Which is correct. The address was valid which is also why he was able to recover it

Because when Google was a dollar a share it was just as much a gamble as any other company. And my parents weren't psychic
You might as well ask why they didn't bet on the winner of the last basketball game

You risk losing it if it drops
@_date: 2018-12-17 11:29:48
What kind of question is that? How is anyone else here meant to know if you would be ruined?  We don't know how you are, or how much you're going to buy or what your situation is. 
Is the amount you want to buy enough to ruin you if you lost it? Then yes, obviously it can ruin you if the price goes down and you lost it. Otherwise no it won't ruin you...
