Because crypto as a whole seems to function like an index.

Unless you have been shorting. But regardless this fall was necessary. That ridiculous $700 spike couldn't last. We needed some negative momentum so that we can move forward. Think of it as a good thing. Try to buy in somewhere in the 1900s.

Unbuy it

We're already on the moon.

Coinbase sucks. You should have used GDAX. There is zero customer support, and they're as slow as fucking possible when it comes to everything. 
Your transaction is made. It will go through. You'll get you coins by the 25th probably. Pray it doesn't plummet in the meantime. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:43:47
Uh.... you're probably going to get charged twice now. Transactions are processing very slowly. But they will go through eventually. 
And unfortunately, customer service does not exist. So if you do get charged twice, don't expect a refund.

I'd say 2200 within the next 5 days 
@_date: 2017-06-27 15:23:36
We are just getting started. About the break the necklace. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 18:16:01
I would wait for the fall. The value is, in my opinion, way too high for what it is actually worth right now. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 20:43:34
Use gdax and buy on limit orders... zero fees... and it's still coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:50:47
Not for a wire transfer, no. I sent USD from bank to account. Bank confirmed it, coinbase has done nothing. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 23:45:28
You'll be fine. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 15:22:47
Should have waited for the dip. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 19:35:51
Sounds like it's time to airmon-ng your neighbors ;)
@_date: 2017-06-20 22:51:43
It's going down to 2100-2200, then back up. M-top head&amp;shoulder. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:49:23
I've been waiting 5 days for a same day wire transfer to complete. Coinbase is fucked right now. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 23:29:31
Don't market order
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:11:58
No they won't. I wire deposited 3 days ago (supposed to only take one day) and money is still not in. Bank deposits usually take 7+ days with their shit service. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 22:56:46
I manipulate the fuck out of it lol. It's all about being able to read patterns. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 15:35:51
;) 
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:10:28
Smart money wants you to panic and sell your coin, so they can buy it. Once they get enough, they'll drop the wall, the price will spike upward, and everyone who panic sold loses. 
Told you so.

Shit I downloaded 1TB of movies the other day. I absolutely couldn't live with a cap like that. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 15:04:33
Maybe one more day. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 22:44:30
Everything is manipulated. But if you can find a pattern, you win big. Use the API. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 20:46:28
Happened last week
@_date: 2017-06-24 18:39:27
Down we go. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 17:22:24
Head&amp;Shoulders trend on 1day timeline, 7 days of mostly positive momentum, and an m-top forming. Several reasons to go down a good bit. Expecting to bottom out 2200-2300 in the next 5-6 days before we climb again. 
Plus uncertainty associated with seg. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 01:56:39
What are you even trying to ask
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:52:56
I don't think they were even remotely equipped to handle the volume they're experiencing. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:28:30
I don't see the pattern on my charts. What time frame are you looking at? I'm thinking 1day?
I'm very curious about this pattern. I write algorithms to predict movements, and this looks like it could be useful. If you're looking at 1day, are you expecting to level out around 2100-2200?
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:47:25
That's what it was
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:17:34
Hi it's me the Saudi prince just wire me $1,000 and I will send you $2,147,483,647 back

Crypto functions like an index. Sure, it's got shit loads of bots. But that's only part of the reason it moves together. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 19:31:45
Did your wire transfer go through? I submitted one on Monday for $3000, and it still has not arrived...
@_date: 2017-06-29 18:27:57
It makes sense. My strategy is generally to sit on USD rather than BTC because of the volatility. Especially right now with the price as (once again, in my opinion) ridiculously high as it is. As much as I love BTC (I've been around since 2013) I do not think it is worth $3000 a coin. 
Anyway, what I generally do is buy a bunch low, sell them all high, rinse and repeat. In the interim, I'm sitting on USD. While I may miss out on random spikes up, I also avoid most of the random spikes down. 
It's a dangerous game. And with ~30k invested, a $300-$500 spike down (which can sometimes occur within the span of 1-2 days) fucking hurts. So be careful. Do your research. Watch trends, and try your best to make an educated decision. I'm a huge fan of technical indicatorsand external influences like govt interference, regulations, and ESPECIALLY ransomware (which seems to always cause a spike due to the payout demand). 
The way I look at it, it's educated gambling. Don't get too greedy, and take small gains. Good luck. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:45:10
Honestly, I'm not sure. Maybe you'll get lucky with having limits.
