What's the consensus on storing coins in one of their "vaults" rather than in one of their wallets?

Alright, I think it's time for me to make the jump. Is there any particular tutorial you would recommend?

That look, I know exactly what you mean...having seen it firsthand is what will prevent me from ever getting married. The transition can occur unbelievably quickly from affection to one of complete annoyance, and for no apparent reason. Literally, "unbelievably quickly" in the sense that I wouldn't have thought it possible if I myself hadn't been on the receiving end a couple of times. That's why, as much as it sucked, reading some of these other perspectives makes me feel fortunate to have experienced it before ever putting my financial wellbeing on the line.

This. Way too many variables at play, I'm an econometrician and it just isn't possible to realistically build a statistically robust model for Bitcoin prices or adoption. 
Do I doubt that someone could contrive this conclusion? Not at all, but that's because a skilled practitioner could make this kind of model say virtually anything he wanted it to. 
tl;dr: Even if his story is true, this is meaningless.

I like where your head is at, but how would you keep this from being abused? 
* If trash is measured per item, why not just stand in front of the trashcan with a ream of paper and throw one piece away at a time to collect? 
* If trash is measured by weight, why not just throw away gravel to collect? 
If a system can be gamed for individual financial gain, then it will be - that's why Bitcoin exists. You have to protect against that.

Can you tell me more or point me in the right direction?

I used to think it was something of a responsibility to act as an evangelist for crypto. Not anymore. People will figure it out soon enough when they realize their dollars and euros are comparatively worthless.

The bail-in was a huge deal when it happened in March/April 2013. This event coincided with the price of Bitcoin rising towards $100 and the connection between the two events wasn't lost on mainstream media outlets:
Just from a few seconds of googling:
* 2013/03/28 - [Bitcoin prices surge post-Cyprus bailout](
* 2013/03/27 - [Bitcoin Bonanza: Cyprus Crisis Boosts Digital Dollars](
* 2013/03/23 - [Cyprus Crisis Boosting Unique Currency, the Bitcoin](
* 2013/03/28 - [Bitcoin hits record exchange values with Cyprus banking crisis](
I really can't overstate how big of a deal it was at the time to see Bitcoin discussed so positively by these major news outlets. Remember, back in 2013 barely anyone knew how to describe Bitcoin (or blockchains in general). The Cyprus bail-in gave an ENORMOUS amount of exposure to Bitcoin and put crypto on the radar for a lot of people.
Edit: Needed to change a couple of words, I think I wrote this when I was still asleep.

Not understanding the weakness of SMS 2FA is bad enough by itself, but I can't even fathom this dude deciding to just go to bed after not being able to access his Gmail account.
