Rockefeller owed around 2% of all USA GDP for quite a while... Now probably his family still plays with like at least 1

Businessman asking such questions in reddit,? IMHO you. Re not ready for this :,)

You can also ask reddit community to setup a node for you, just ask some friendly admin and talk to him private. If you re not afraid yo give log in info to your server. I got my v0. 14 setup that way for me last week. Thaks awesome people! :)

Buddy, a year ago the price was around 200$... Now it's 5x higher. For 3 years we been going backward price - wise, nobody can guarantee that this won't happen again.

Is there a timer that goes with the thing? 
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:18:48
Why its clogged? If it basically has the same specs like VPN. I would use that phone only for the node.

Running full node is enough. I started my v.0.14 yesterday :)

I. M in bitcoin since 2011 and glued to reddit but it took me nearly half a year to fix a broken node. And did it now because community needs support. How many users are like me I don't know but fix in 12 hours.... One must be super syst admin glued to ssh.

Is there any updates about the guy who bought those pizzas? Is he still alive or maybe killed himself? What does he do? Any guesses about his remaining stash?

I have been there and spoke to one business guy, me wanted to make trades btc to cash. When i said my rates (2-4%) he just laughed and said that they have awesome bank system, super easy and cheap to send cash to EU. But its just one case, probably the majority are poor people and dont have access to banking (i'm not arguing with facts from the article)
@_date: 2017-01-25 12:40:32
Why do you need all that info?  It only gives you loads of stress!  That kind of stuff is only temporary noise,  turn it off to make your world more beautiful! :) 
@_date: 2017-01-16 21:13:37
KYC - could you tell their average their age, education, technical expertise and why are they interested in BTC IRA? Also, if bitcoins goes down (lets say total crash to everlasting 0$), how much are these people going to loose? 
@_date: 2017-01-07 16:12:02
Do they have bank account in EU?
@_date: 2017-01-06 14:59:16
Indonesia is full of banks, I didnt knew they were unbanked :) 
@_date: 2017-01-08 09:46:21
