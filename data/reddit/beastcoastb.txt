I did have that, got rid of all of it and xferred into ether and alts. Bitcoin is just a gold standard to compare others to, it is a GOOD thing that it has stabilized in value. As far as a currency or "investment" there are countless better alternatives depending on one's goals.

What are you doing here, jabronie? Why on earth would anyone in their right mind sell an irreversible commodity (bitcoin) to someone who can easily reverse the transaction? Your best bet is to suck it up and use a verified exchange, use a new credit card, or simply transfer funds from a bank account. Using the bank deposit method will also reduce your fees
