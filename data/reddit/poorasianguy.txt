Trying not to play for sympathy.

Or maybe can someone dumb down this tx for me?
Who is the actual sender?
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:27:18
I had similar concerns.. that it might not even get to the original sender. hopefully they see this post and find me. i'll give it some time. most people copy/paste addresses to send so I really want to know what happened.

Can you tell me which address the 3btc originated from?
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:46:45
Please don’t send any btc to these addresses. I’m not trying to get any btc. Just trying to contact the owners.

Well I feel stupid I could have just asked this from the beginning. So if the btc gets sent to that address, the funds return to the original sender? Not the other address?
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:24:49
this is infact what im trying to do. I just didn't want to spell it out all in the top post lest i get a million messages claiming the btc.
its not like finding a $100 bill on the ground.. this could potentially ruin someone's life.

That’s exactly right, odds are so close to 0 it’s practically  0. I’ve already asked every single person i know that uses crypto and nobody has that address.
Last resort was to ask the community.

If issue gets resolved I’ll post what happened. Thanks for understanding.

/yawn. Using memes for an argument. I guess we are done here. It’s pretty clear you’ve never tried to send large amounts of cash across international borders.

Try to send someone $20k-200k usd and you will have your answer.
