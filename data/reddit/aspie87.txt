This is the reason I believe bitcoin is shit and traditional banking is much much better. Traditional banks should use blockchain to reduce their working cost.

Bitcoin now have serious competitors in the shape of Etherium and IOTA.
IOTA especially has many good qualities such as scalability, speed and zero fee, which are inherent problems with Bitcoin and Etherium and other blockchain currencies. Tango-based IOTA may prosper in future.
For this reason, I believe, Bitcoin and Etherium may not rise as much as speculated, as newer third generation technologies come.

If I don't deposit with someone, I will have to save my key unto some harddisk which is prone to ransomware viruses or simple badsectors. If I commit the key to paper, it can be found. Its too complex to memorize. This technology is not for a layman.
Banks blockchain technology can be regulated by government. Having their required inflation to adjust market economics is actually desirable or a state can endup like Greece where they can't change the inflation rate to attract Investment.

You need to go back to school.

I don't know what you are talking about. Bank based blockchain will be transparent, not manipulable, and quick.
Why don't you live in jungle and see if you can live without government.

And if I lost my wallet to bad sector on memory chip? Don't say I memorize the key. Average memory fails every three years.

State banks know each and every transaction of private banks. 2008 happened because they were not quick enough to point out the bubble. But thanks to blockchain technology, we can quickly identify the emerging problems and control them in time. Bitcoin's only good thing is blockchain technology.

If something like mtgox happened in future, who will help me recover my losses?

Will you be able to explain this to your average street person? 
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:38:35
No need for proof of money. Its waste of electricity. State banks inject money. We have been doing it for centuries and its working fine.

Only nerds and conspiracy theorists are afraid of governments. I think they do more good than harm. Bitcoin is leading to anachronism.

Don't support conspiracy theorists. Zero inflation is even worse than hyperinflation. Look at Japan. Recession of more than two decades.

I know all of them, but what if hardware memory fails or you forgot the key or house burnt down with your paper key? Can you explain all this stuff to a layman?
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:14:50
You haven't even touched the reason I gave.
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:25:52
I want peace of mind that if I fuckup forgetting the key, or transaction fraud, then bank can reverse the payment. Government regulation is not bad all times.

Blockchain is simply a networked database. And banks are very wellversed in this technology.
@_date: 2017-05-27 17:16:32
That's why I hate bitcoin. And don't invest in it. An ideal currency should have 2% inflation rate.
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:41:26
Bank based blockchain can also be not manipulated, edited or changed. .... Bitcoin has no upper edge here.
