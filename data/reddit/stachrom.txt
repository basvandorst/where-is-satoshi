Good Question - the SNB  asked them selfe this Question, and decided to stop "printing" money and buying all those damn eruos for 1.20 .- 
What else should they do with all those euros? 
They can keep or sell it. 
But either way they show up in the books. 
The SNB is responsible for healthy swiss currency.
She is acting in favor of switzerland, at least in the long run.
They are not suposed to print money to solve short interests and make the situation worse in the long run. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 14:04:05
but.. the SNB is sitting on 250 billion euro...  those 250 billion are bought at a price at 1.20.- 
the total amount of currency reserves is allmost 500 billion [1] 
If they like to sell them now --&gt;  1 chf = 1 euro ...  thats a huge loss for them and the swiss gov.

You dont deposit cash. 
To start trading you need a small amount of bitcoins (about 0.02 BTC) - This is needed for arbitrage.

Lets do some fact checks.
Start at 29:03 - 
Unemployment rate correlate with the gold-Standard - ( Kind of true - but the opposite of his statement ) 
Its much more like the aftermath of  World War 2, the great depression, economic shift from homework to industrial work, all the shiny social insurance  - like AHV, IV, ( ALV ( and many more reasons... 
Its really complex building. 
Saifedean Ammous rips out just one piece and tries to fit in his narratives. 
- Switzerland had before 1970 a much higher period of unemployment rate - multiple times. 
- Switzerland left the Goldstandard 1936
**Switzerland on the Goldstandard:** 
* from 23. Dezember 1865 - 1914
* World War 1  Break  1914 - 1924 
* 1924 - 1936 
* at the Weekend of 26./27. September 1936 Switzerland left the Goldstandard. 
 
**Unemployment Rate**
* Around 1920 -&gt; 3.5% 
* 1930 - 1940 About 4.5%
 (German)
I dont know...  most of the Crypto-shit is just horrible...  (Not all - but a lot of... )
