So going off this, is this to computer you originally created the wallet on?  Do you remember if you copied the seed anywhere? Took a picture of it?  I know it makes you re-enter it so unless your memory is that good..  I would image the disk, mount it on some linux distro, and start searching for files with seed words in it.  The list of possible words is located here:
How much have you used it in time since you created it?  If not much, once you have an image you can run a utility which can scan for deleted files, then export and run the same search on those files.
If you want help with that process you can PM me.

I tried a bunch of lists and some of my own/your words, no dice.  One question, as the more info we have the closer we may be able to get.  With electrum, you mentioned you fired it up, copied the addresses, and sent the BTC.  As far as my experience with electrum you can't do anything until you provide the decryption password.  How did you get the send addresses in the first place?

I've got it cranking on a few boxes, I'll let you know if I hit anything.  I would still recommend scouring your filesystem for some kind of hint.
Edit, about you comment for version, looking at electrum twitter, 2.3 was released on 6/12/2015, so would imagine you are definitely higher than 1.  2.0 was release in early March of that year according to their twitter.
