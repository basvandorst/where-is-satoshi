That's the thing - he didn't, other people did. 
This isn't a "free speech" thing, it's a "don't use other people's resources given in good faith to spread your own views surreptitiously" thing. It's weird that you can't see the distinction, or the reason why people would be upset that they were part of spreading a message that they disagree with (even if they didn't get robbed!). If he didn't realize that some people would have a problem with him using their resources to spread religious messages, then he's an idiot. Assuming he's not an idiot, and he did realize that people would not be okay with it, but he did it anyway without telling them, then he's an asshole.
What does that have to do with free speech? Did I suggest he should be imprisoned for speaking? Or that there should be laws against it? No. I suggested that he broke a social contract, which is unethical and dickish.

wow so post-modern

i don't think anyone wondered why. the concern is whether it's ethical to use other people's computing power to disseminate religious shit without their knowledge.

that should be "fuck out of HERE with illiterate"

if he's using other people's computing power to surreptitiously embed religious text in the blockchain forever, it doesn't seem like "his relationship with god is his own." it seems like the exact opposite of that, in fact. 
would you think it was no big deal if the text was promoting scientology, racist propaganda, etc?
the code he writes is completely separate from behavior like that, and one does not excuse the other.

He also seems to be implying that while he is extreme pro free-speech, he simultaneously believes that speech doesn't really matter - after all, no one was robbed.

uhhh, what's this study you speak of
@_date: 2018-11-08 18:00:58
no, you just have to report it.

that's not the same as "does not allow"
