So you mean that the *most important part* is missing?  That's lazy software development to say "It's done, but 99.9% of people cannot use it".  
By your logic... then Segwit is "in Coinbase" because it's supported by protocol and fork happened, but "*it just doesn't have the interface*"
Standard software developer trick to say something is "finished" when it is in fact not.
They can lead by action and set an example instead of just talking and expecting others to do *as they say, but not as they do*
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:44:33
I understand what you are saying -- and 95% of developers would say that. Unfortunately they are dead wrong.
*The UI is the software*
Let me elaborate a bit...
Software *serves a purpose*, in other words it is *intentionality* encoded to serve an agent (ie: humans, or other machines).
If there is no way to grasp at the intention, no way to *get access to* it, then it does not work and practically speaking does not exist.
It's like the thought experiment of the "unseen tree". It's there, but no one has ever seen it, or will see it.  In what sense is this a "tree" if you cannot climb on it, harvest the fruit, use it for wood, etc.
This is waxing philosophical, but it is at the heart of it when you investigate deep down and keep asking "what is software". You get at this root of it.
A simpler analogy:
A feature is always created with *some user in mind*. When we create a product it is for a customer.
If we fail to connect the customer, user, etc to the product -- then it practically speaking is *unusable* and may as well not exist for that customer.
Car paint Analogy...
That analogy fails because the body/image/UI (ie: steering wheel, door, locks, shifter, etc) *is accessible*.
We are not talking about Bitcoin Core UI just having crappy controls with non-intuitive UI... we are talking about a *lack of a UI at all* to achieve the desired end.
The better analogy would be a car that is invisible and untouchable to certain people unless they have a certain visual receptor in their eyes and a special touch-sensation in their hands.
That's what we are comparing here....not a shitty paint job.
Even another way to hit the point home from a different angle.
**What is the Internet?**
As a reductionist perspective, it is a way of organizing *electrons*. More broadly: it is a way of encoding information in electrons to *connect agents together*.
If the final connection, the UI -- the photons coming off the screen hitting an "eye", is missing.... then you have missed the most important part.
Which is why in software development we always start with *use case* definitions first (or at least a rough outline of the goal you are allowing the user to achieve). Ie: "Add product to shopping cart", "Make payment for order", etc. It is **always** coupled to an action the user can perform.
A use case with no visible or perceivable actions is like the "unseen tree": a complete illusion and does not exist for that agents world view.

The decision point has passed. SegWit with larger blocks creates a non Nash Equilibrium and has quadratic hashing problem. In other words: larger blocks will create less and less of an incentive for miners.
However, if we could go back in time and re-make the decision...then I stand behind what Adam Back et al proposed at the time:  which was to start with a 2MB, then 4MB, up to 8MB increase until LN is in a usable state.
Since we need 133MB blocks at least, it would have been the prudent thing to do and continue growing usage and adoption and would have averted a fork of the network and would have averted having Ethereum created and instead we would now have an ecosystem of ICO's, smart contracts, and cheaper payments on BTC.
It is apparent that the wrong decision was made and the consequences were foretold, predictable and actually came to pass -- ney, it was *encouraged* that we would get a "fee market" and success was measured by high fees (praying for $1000+ fees by many core devs)
If I was in charge of a business and my lead engineers decided to make this trade-off, then they would be fired at the least.
The only conclusion that one can make is that:
- Blockstream's business interests got in the way of the correct engineering solution; and/or:
- The core devs are incompetent engineers (favoring "coolish" tech over practicality and keeping technical debt to a minimum) -- Just look at Greg Maxwell rambling on about cool things you can do and sorely lacking in business and economics discussion about how to grow the operation
The correct decision for BTC is now: Stay the course and take LN to its logical conclusion.
The correct decision for BCH is now: Stay the course with the original roadmap of the Nakamoto whitepaper to its logical conclusion.
*We*, as users, merchants and miners (yes I mine both) stand to benefit from having 2 different approaches to creating sound money. Much better than only having one option that we are stuck with.

Is it criminal? No
Is it wrongful? Up for debate.
Bitcoin is promoting the *bitcoin protocol* and Segwit tx's are not "p2p chain of digital signatures" as defined.
We don't get to make up our own definition of BitTorrent, or HTTP, or WWW. *These are definitions*
A Bitcoin-Segwit is a "p2p chain of hashes(witnesses) of digital signatures".
The fact is that there were 2 forks: Segwit and Large block fork.   
One of them follows the definition and intended plan to the T and the other caused expensive transactions and slow confirmations.
Is it wrongful?  That is up for debate, as you can see.
Certainly very clear that it is not malicious fraud.... you might argue it is the opposite.

 is merely promoting the *bitcoin protocol* as defined in the Whitepaper and is free to pick a side.
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:04:50


That is patently false. 
2 forks happened at same time:  Segwit Fork and Big Block Fork.
The Segwit-chain (Bitcoin - BTC) is not backwards or forwards compatible with the block data structure and tx format with the Satoshi client.
The original Satoshi client *did not have a block size limit, but was later added as a temporary measure when BTC was worth less than a fraction of a penny*.
In other words, you can feed the transactions in Bitcoin Cash today back into the very original Satoshi client *and it will all work and check out perfectly*.
It is the Segwit tx's that cannot be accepted since it is an entirely different kind of a beast.
It is disingenuous at worst to say "BTC did not change" or ignorant of what actually happened in the code base around the 2 forks (soft, hard, whatever....they are forks).
Take a look at the Github repo for both code bases and fetch Satoshi's client off Sourceforge and compare for yourself.
This is not an opinion, but a statement of fact -- you can perform the test yourself even to verify that what I'm saying is a true statement of fact.
Whether or not Ver or others are "autistic" does not change the fact that the *electronic cash system* that Satoshi created is only compatible now with Bitcoin Cash.
 
@_date: 2018-01-01 08:48:28
You obviously are not a software developer.
It is a **virtue** to be a lazy developer and much harder than it looks.
The best decision is the ome that prolongs taking on technical debt or forcing design decisions too early.
Since the LN network will require 133MB blocks to support the world, it is obvious to any competent developer that they made the wrong decision.
However the purpose of Blockstream's "decision" was not what they publicly said, but in fact was to slow down adoption.
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:00:45
How will the fee go up? If blocks keep growing, then the fee market will dictate it will be 1 Sat/Byte.
If "they", the miners decide to form a cartel and stifle block size (like BTC) then *I will personally* fork it and keep BCH's large block plan.
I'm sure 1000's of other small miners will continue to follow the vision.
Bitcoin protocol is a multi-headed hydra. You can cut off one head, but another one grows.
The best Head (fork) that serves the best economic need will prevail in the long term.

Has anyone here perhaps considered that when the *best authentic brand domains and usernames* are promoting what's merely in the Whitepaper....that maybe a wrong turn was taken at the *fork in the road*?
Literally the only thing Bitcoin Legacy (BTC) has going is the fact that the ticker followed that particular branch in the fork (the Segwit fork vs. the larger block fork)
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:08:19
There were 2 forks: Segwit and Big blocks.
Only 1 of them is compatible with the original Satoshi client (hint: there were no block limits in the first client intentionally)
Soft Fork, Hard Fork.
Tomatoe, Tomato -- both are network upgrades.  Segwit creates non-fungible coins and now we have the debacle where only 8% of tx's are Segwit and serious complexity in implementing it reliably.
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:03:40
Didn't others say that they will implement SegWit when Bitcoin Core Wallet implements it?
As far as I can tell...SegWit is not even implemented in Bitcoin Core.
Not sure how you can expect others to take on the expensive development task of implement something that even the Bitcoin Core team does not think is important to implement in their own wallet.
Maybe I'm missing something?

Bitcoin w/ Segwit is a (soft) fork -- yet unusable until most miners/wallets/users adopt.
Bitcoin w/ large blocks is a (hard) fork -- which works fully the moment it went live.
"fork" is just another word for network upgrade.
The fact is that the network was upgraded into *2 different paths*. You can call it hard or soft fork, but the fact remains that Segwit is the only fork, soft or otherwise, that cannot be fed back into the original Satoshi client (the one with no block size) and get it to validate since Genesis.
But you can validate from genesis with the Bitcoin Cash (since all it is simply larger blocks)

You realize that basically *all software* is "forked"?  That's how Git/Github works. 
Bitcoin Core forks their code with every PR request -- that's simply how modern software development works.  Your point about "forking the codebase" is moot, since that's just how things are done to manage code changes.

Except they will offer credit on their LN hubs.
Think like Visa/Mastercard on a LN hub where there needs to be a minimum 'reserve balance'.  Effectively fractional reserve system is possible and likely will be encouraged.
Chances are that the various jurisdictions will require any LN hubs to register as a Money Service Business (MSB) or Money Transmitter and then require you to be incorporated, keep records, etc.
Having simply miners to deal with.... there is no middleman to target.  They can tell people to turn off their computers, but that's an entirely different thing that running a LN node.

This is a common reaction from most people.
It is an interesting phenomenon.
My theory is that the cognitive dissonance is so hard and there is too much ego investment into the perception of "money as backed by something" that other people cannot let go.
Acknowledging/accepting Bitcoin is like accepting **all of our currencies are shared illusions**. It's too hard of a pill to swallow.
People work **decades** to save a few hundred grand. And here are people earning millions of fucking around on a computer collecting virtual shit.
This, to put it simply, is offensive to the core of a person's ego investment.
When an idea, that challenges your core opinions on something, comes along -- it feels like a personal attack.
Try this:
- Find something that someone has done *for a long time*. Anything.
It could be as simple as:
- Someone who sells fruit juices for life (they are spreading toxins, aka "sugar" into the environment)
- Someone who works on combustion motors/muscle cars (they just got **owned** by Tesla's roadster)
- Someone who saves into their RSP, thinking it cannot be pulled out. (When it is actually a tax deferred account and can be used long before retirement, for strategic financial reasons)
Then challenge the idea of combustion engines, explain how you can actually buy a house *within* an RSP or withdraw before you retire for strategic purposes, explain how sugar is cancer causing and the reason 60% of Americans are fat.
They will take it as a huge personal blow and will fight you tooth and nail to shut you up and show themselves they were *"correct all along"*
**Most people do not even know that all modern money is "FIAT" and still think it has backed by gold, or something**
Think of all those "bank robber" movies. Think of the movies of "diamond/jewel heists". You can paint the picture of how *utterly incompetent and unknowledgeable people are* on these matters.
Then **Imagine these people chasing money their whole lives, for it to go up in a puff of smoke**.  That's what they are reacting to.
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:27:46

Now we're getting somewhere and actually digging deeper. Let's get to it....
Notice upfront, this is a lot more nuanced and at this point we stand is not immediately clear who is "right" and whether I'm being pretentious here. I'm not intentionally muddying the discussion or conflating QM to another realm.
The fact is that abstract thoughts and thinking is very much a physical phenomenon and the research in the area of how QM affects our thinking is not a closed shut case as Tegmark and Penrose et al point out [1, 2]
Even plants use quantum mechanical "random walk" to optimize delivery of photos to the core for conversion of energy [3]
Birds are now known to have 'magnetoreception' which leverages quantum effects [4], which presumably the bird is able to "sense" (ie: become aware/conscious of) and use to their advantage.

2) [Stanford Pub](

4) [Wikipedia](


Sure. But the fact that something became on object of our thought already contains the beginnings of its future state. In other words, it starts to exist, *in some measure*, once it "starts to shape up" in related systems (ie: our minds, markings, bandwidth usage, etc). This is reaffirming my point that we're only talking about things that *exist in some shape or form*. 


There is a physical momentum and position representation for all phenomena.  Unless you are saying that thoughts in your brain do not exist physically?
I'm not conflating the two. My position is that thoughts are movements in the neurons of the brain, and all thinking is related to *some kind of future work/action, "utility"*. An abstract thought that is not communicated, or has no utility *simply does not exist by definition*.
The HUP certainly applies to something as abstract as the concept of a mathematical singularity such as "black holes" (which are mental models, first and foremost). In fact, it was this realization that we cannot know position and momentum in blackhole systems that led to discovery of Hawking Radiation [See 
At this point you may be tempted to say that the "black hole" "exists" independent of our thinking and is "not an abstract thought, but independent". You can approach with this line of debate, but you may already be able to see where this is going to head (Idealism vs. Realism debates).
The fact is that the "black hole" is much of an "abstract thought" as it is a "physical one". Trying to separate "thoughts" from physical systems, as you have been doing, reeks of Dualism and leads to an untenable position. There is simply one kind of *thinking-physical-stuff* where thinking-physical are two sides of the same kind (not separate distinct things -- for they would have no identity without the other)


Incorrect. The value is a statistical approximation of the observers preferences. Some observers may be big/small strong/weak and may or may not be able to store, carry, etc the object of valuable consideration.


Incorrect again. A dollar is a concept and represents *discounted future action*. The act of handing me a dollar takes *time* and there is *inflation* with a fiat money supply. This time t is non-zero. 
Therefore the "value" at any time is an approximation and is not 100% accurate (perhaps it is 99.99% accurate for us *right now*, or it is only *80% accurate in Zimbabwae right now with hyper inflation*).


Supply and demand are concepts/models related to actual physical action (ie: actually performing an exchange many times across multiple actors)
The fact that it takes time to move the dollar means the mere act of *engaging in an exchange* inherently means our individual approximations of the accuracy of the value will change.  Some people are slower than others to pull out that dollar from their pocket to give a trivial toy example. Inflation happens at different rates and are usually greater for larger sizes of Time t.


You *cannot know that 300M people agree* that the Crunch bar is worth a dollar without asking them (ie: a measurement) at some bounded time range. **You only know what specific exchange prices were at some time t or range**


Not seeing how preferences for other objects of value are relating to the discussion of value and preferences for a single object.  Also no clue why you are bringing in FTL light travel here and once again how it ties to the argument in any shape.  I never made in claims, or even implied, this has anything to do with FTL or non-locality.


The *entire system is quantum*. Yes, it was "discovered" and exceptionally useful at the micro scales to describe phenomena.  But your brain/mind is at the quantum mechanical scales and by extension is your language, logic, and representations of the world.
It's not like "quantum mechanics goes away" when dealing with our scale. It extends all the way out to observers being entangled with systems of observation (and therefore our brains/minds cannot violate uncertainty principle *even as a model of representation* for it brings about a mathematical contradiction or leads you to extreme solipsism).


You are extremely mistaken on multiple counts. 
**First, ideas do have gravity. Synaptic potential and neuronal motion is due to the matter and energy. ALL matter and energy emanate/produce a gravitational field, however small it may be** See Einstein's resolution to the [Demon Problem](
Second, Abstract systems of value DO abide by quantum mechanical effects, or at least limited/bounded by it and work within the framework. 
An 'abstract system of value' is kind of 'observer making a measurement on a system'. All thought is like this.
Whenever there is an observer and a system, there is a quantum mechanical effect, that is a fact of reality since we discovered QM. This is the crowning achievement of QM and Philosophy that only an extreme tiny fraction of the human population understands (Who has time to spend 10+ years studying QM and Philosophy??)
From Bohr:


Notice that it is always the *description* that is just as complementary as the system being reasoned about. ex: 
“...a complete rupture in the **causal description** of its dynamical behaviour…” (Emphasis mine)
“...Just this situation brings out most strikingly the complementary character of the **description** of atomic phenomena…” (Emphasis mine)
Excerpt from [Informationphilosopher]( on Bohr’s views:
To summarize, Bohr saw many elements of the new quantum mechanics as revealing his deep insight into complementarity. Among them were:
 * psycho-physical role of the "conscious" observer
In later years Bohr came to think that complementarity was important in philosophy and many other fields:
 * psycho-physical parallelism (Light and Life, 1933)
 * mind-body problem
 * biology - mechanism - vitalism
 * subject and object
 * actor and spectator
 * analysis and synthesis
I'm with Bohr and the body of knowledge points in the direction of him being likely correct and *useful description of the nature of our own thought and existence*.

OP, Here me out please.
Nothing good will come out of telling her until you understand where you stand in your relationship with your wife.
If it leaks out that you're sitting on 1.8M, then it will probably cause turmoil in your relationship (new found wealth usually does this).
Literally saying you have 1.8M available now, provides an economic incentive for her to leave you and live for free forever with your child.
Not saying she will do that -- but human beings are economic creatures and over 60% of divorces end, with women initiating 80% of them (to much protest by the man in the relationship.
Divorces are also more likely to be initiated when the child is around 7-9 years old and also around 13 - 16 years old.  This is due to the 'Redevelopment Phase' in a woman's life cycle. See The Rational Male: Preventative Medicine for a description of this.
Also, a house is not a good investment. It's a liability (takes money out of your pocket). A duplex, triplex or fourplex (in a nice neighborhood, one you be proud of owning and living in) on the other hand, is an investment and provides you ability to life for free without working for the rest of your life.
I can say with greater than 50% probability that within the next 5-15 years, if you tell your wife about this, you will lose at least half your investment to her.
Let's say she's extremely loyal and would NEVER divorce you (live with you for next 40+ years of your life).  We can put the probability of divorce down to say...10% chance. Giving her the benefit of the doubt (Because remember, women initiate divorces in 80% of the scenarios).
Therefore a 1.8M investment multipled by the outcome probability of 10% is:
1.8M * 0.10 = $180,000 Expected Value (EV)
But the reality is closer to 25% - 60% I'm sure you will consider reasonable.  
Now ask yourself this:
Is it worth to you $180,000 (or 1M) in TODAY's money to tell her today and deal with all the crisis and pressure this will put on your relationship? (Will her parents, family, friends, your friends, etc.... want any of this 'windfall' and come begging -- to name a couple issues).
Couple all of that with CAPITAL GAINS taxes. You stand to lose 40%-75% of your investment. 
That is in Today's dollars....wait until BTC/BCH hits $100k/coin.
Is roughly $500k-1M today so life changing right now -- that you cannot hold off for another 3 years when you will likely be sitting on millions (And can secure your retirement then....even if someone takes half your money?)

We can agree on some points.
Keeping your good fortune to yourself FOREVER is not a good idea.
The question is WHEN, not IF.

Day of wedding? Or After?
It's always a question of WHEN.
Some people value the safety, stability and emotional health that they need to decide when to disclose important information.  Just as OP is trying to do.

That's what you think and I don't care or have time to explain it to you, sorry.
 
But I'll leave you with this:
Value is a kind of exchange between systems and observers.
Or use an internet definition:
"Value: the regard that something is held to deserve; the importance, worth, or usefulness of something"
The subatomic has value like:
- material for some purpose (building material, water, gas, etc)
- worthy of study for understanding
- in general, utility
Or are you saying there there is no consideration, no use, no utility, and no worth of consideration for a subatomic particle and therefore devoid of **all** value?  You're joking, right?

Yes, and also a physical one. Value is first of a word; it is a type of relationship. Both of these things are grounded in the physics of your mind (neurons, etc), your vocal cords, and any kind of action in the universe to facilitate that trade/interaction.


All things, are of the physical universe. Or do you mean there are heavens above and non-physical realms that somehow magically spring forth from non-physical underpinnings?  Where are you going with this? Our mind is an Operationalized system (ie: exists within a universe that is governed my QM)


They *do* have various kinds of value


Thanks for confirming what I'm saying. Whether you find it 'weird' or 'esoteric' is besides the point.


Incorrect. Just about everything can be modelled as a wave function and the question of usefulness of that model depends on the problem you are trying to solve.
For instance, I can model the probability that you are clicking this page, or currently wiping your ass right now and use that as a guide before verifying what is actually the case. (Don't worry, I don't want to see your shitty ass in person)


If you knew the value of something in the physical universe was 0 and it existed nowhere.  Then you would know the position and momentum with 100% certainty. This is a violation of the HUP.  I would genuinely like to here your rebuttal on this point.


How the fuck is GR related to this in any way?

Because they know if they set fees to minimum, then users will call in complaining that transactions have not completed (*for days*) and then drain them of customer support resources.
The reality is that companies *need to* set a high bar, since the network has shown volatile, expensive, and unreliable.

I have another idea for you:
1. Mix small amount of BTC into a small wallet (Make sure to do a small transfer first and it actually works since there are scam mixers out there. I lost $200 like this the other day).  Say $50k worth
2. Send the mixed amount to an exchange and start trading it for ETH, etc.  You will have a story line of "Had about 8 BTC, forgot about it, started trading it". Let this go on for a few months (but don't lose it obviously)
3. Let it come out that you have this play money and you wanted to tell her and use it for a good purpose
4. Watch what unfolds over the coming weeks, months, and the year.
Based on observations of 4) you can decide where things stand.
At no point do you lie and say that is ALL you have. Just say that you BOUGHT X and HAVE X amount.  
If I have 10 apples in my kitchen. And I tell someone I have 3 apples. Did I lie? No I did not --&gt; It is a fact that I have 3 apples.  Do NOT LIE TO HER. 
But there's also no need to describe to her the texture of your shits in the toilet either.

Selling 300k of BTC triggers a capital gain ($1 worth of BTC sold for 300k).

I will continue to be happy with my 20% gains and do not care whether you are satisfied working *for someone else* and instead sticking to your 4-6% paper investments (after capital gains tax and inflation it is closer to 1.5-2.5% btw)
It is not a full time job to manage a couple of triplexes.  If I add up my time fielding calls and working through issues, it results in me getting paid about $700/hour.

On that point you are incorrect. See the EPR Paradox and once you truly understand the resolution of that paradox and what Bohr said, then you will see that it applies to the *structure of information and thinking itself, via the Principle of Complementarity*. Understanding this bit is the crowning achievement of modern physics, not just fucking around with subatomic particles.


I never said it was commensurate. Just that it *typically* follows that a person's wealth is related to their *history, mental state, luck, hard work*.  Life will serve you a shit sandwich, but some are hungry enough and will work through it. (Apologies for mental picture in advance dear readers). **As such, it would be wise practice for anyone to fully embrace the Reality/Reflection Principle that they themselves deserve nothing more and nothing less than that which they have achieved, and that which they will achieve in their own current and future existence**


I never said it is 100% fair or even any % fair. Agree with you.

This. AWALT.
OP, you are playing with fire here.
If you have a stable paycheck to paycheck life -- then enjoy it and start getting better with money management, and help her too.
The reality is that if you already had Wealth mindset, you would already be wealthy (income properties, small businesses, sound dividend yielding investments, etc). This is called the Reality Principle (You deserve nothing more or less than what you currently have - and your wealth is a reflection of your past and habits).
I know this is harsh, but understand the fact that money is merely a reflection of the value you have accrued and captured in life by providing value to others.  If you cannot stem the bleeding now, then the 1.8M will also evaporate in the future due to Scarcity and Poverity Mentality. The question is WHEN, not IF.
That 300k house will become 450k after paying capital gains BTW. And then you still have to pay $100's a month in utilities, insurance, and property taxes and upkeep. Bad Investment (unless it is income producing).
If she does not like her job....then she can fix it. The solution is simple and people will blame others for their position in the world.  
Having 1.8M would cause anyone to see it as a Lottery Ticket, especially with Poverty Mentality and the worst in human nature comes out.
Work on developing a wealth plan today. You will be shocked at how far you get in 1-2 years in life with an incessant focus on creating Systems of Wealth for your family.
I literally went from net worth of negative -$20k to positive $180k within 1.5 years. Making conservative plays and strategic thinking with buying my first income property and careful planning.
There's no reason that you and your family cannot stop living pay check to pay check within 1 year.

You realize that to retire in safety you will need approx. 2M per person by the time you are 65 years old right?
What the heck do you think 1.8M will do for you and your family when you have 50 years to live?
Immediately blow 500k on a house and be saddled with 1k/month in utilities/insurance/property taxes/new roof/etc.  Over 40 years that works out to about an additional 480k.
So what you're saying is use about 1M of the 1.8M to just have a roof over your head and somehow manage to live off of 800k over 40 years?

All that being said, I'm more interested in the actual merits of research and implementation and testable hypothesis about building a true P2P monetary system.  Healthy competition is excellent.

- multiple peices of ID
- Address of receiving bank institution (which my vendor did not send me)
- Bank Institution code, routing, transit, IBAN
It took me 2 trips and about 20 minutes each time.  And they charged me $30.  I'm getting hosed and so are millions of others.


Why on earth would I want to use a pseudo-currency when I can use a real one?
Feel free to use your fiat which has a "published" inflation rate of about 2% and frequently approaches 5-10% inflation during "bailouts" . 
Your 'real cash' can have you bank account frozen if bank/government deems it unacceptable.
Your 'real cash' can be seized by the police.
Your 'real cash' cannot move across borders easily ($10,000USD limit at airports, etc).
Your bank account is not currency either, but known as a Depository Liability which is actually different than the Currency itself.  Since withdrawing the currency adjusts the reserve balances at the central bank (for the banking institution) whereas performing a transfer between Depository Liability accounts between institutions does not affect the reserve balance at the central bank.
Calling that "real" cash is completely misunderstanding what is M0, M1, M2, etc...
Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin.  That is HARD MONEY. Global trans-national currency.  
We will laugh in 10 years looking back that we put up with fiat and national currency bullshit for so long that backroom dealings can easily destroy and inflate away.

I saved every damn dollar I could within the first year. Built myself up to about positive $10k.
Then I took a private loan of $15k at 8% interest (yikes!) to just put it in my bank account for about 60 days, so that I can show a mortgage lender in the future that I "had it saved".
That's $25k for downpayment on a Triplex building (5% down). In the intervening months I examined and analyzed over about 30 properties so I knew what I was looking for (Good cashflow, good location, potential build to build more later with the zoning, etc).
Then the property I was looking for came up. I offered within 10 minutes of hitting the market. Got it locked down.
Moved into the building and rented the 2 other units out. Then I got a room mate for my basement unit.  Living free (Net of ALL expenses).
Worked hard again for a year, literally not paying rent to live. Saved up the $15k to pay back the private loan. But I didn't pay it back yet, 
I used the 'Savings' in my bank account to repeat the process and bought another small multiplex for 5% down, telling the lender it was closer to my workplace and I would move into it.   Closed that deal, raised the rents. Now generating $300/month in profit after all expenses.
Market went insane and both appreciated, still have not sold (and will likely not for a long time). 
Now pulling in $800/month PROFIT and LIVE FOR FREE FOR LIFE. With every single imaginable expenses covered by the rents.
Continued saving and built up equity with my tenants money.
Next step is to get to $3000/month in profit and retire by age 35. Had I started thinking this way in my 20's, I would have been long retired.
All the best in your journey.

The world is not going to care about some philosophical point or ideology "trustless, blah blah ".
People living on $3.00 a day will go with what is cheaper (and just as fast, etc).
If something is 10cents (3% of their daily income), or something is 1/10th of a cent (0.03% of daily income...or basically nothing) then *they will use that method*.
Human nature is going to optimize for *profit* and self interest. Exactly the kind that Nakamoto Consensus explains the miners will do (and hence all the forks, etc)

Scaled? It has flatlined in growth.
There was a ton of merchant adoption happening in 2014 and 2015 and then everything was crushed out since fees rose to be greater than debit and credit cards for merchants.

You are speaking of the "3rd person", when I'm talking to someone as the "2nd person".
That second person is OP, probably in a 1st world country and those factors you described do not apply.
If OP asked a DIFFERENT question like:
**"How would you help alleviate poverty/provide opportunities in XYZ country" -- then I would not reply with the Reflection/Reality Principle since it only works best as a discussion point between 2 people TALKING AMONGST THEMSELVES.**
Also, let's look at your points.


I did not say people deserve starvation. I said that the state that an organism finds themselves in is *simply a reflection of their environment, context, history, and decisions.*
If you are using the term "deserve" to indicate that I have no support, compassion, or assistance to give to people. Then you are completely misunderstanding me. 
A poor person who comes to me, to learn, for help --&gt; deserves my help if I choose to afford to (self-fulfilling virtuous cycle).  
A poor person who punches me in my face does not deserve my help/assistance.  Do you get it?


Are you suggesting that you take money from another person(s) to finance your life?  
The top 2% of earners pay over 50% of ALL TAXES and the top 20% of earners are paying over 90% of ALL TAXES.  
What is a fair distribution of hard work, effort?  I'm already part of the top 20% of USA paying more than my fair share of taxes that goes to less-fortunate people to get medical care and support.
Do they deserve my help via taxes, as I'm providing now? OF COURSE THEY DO -- because they reality is that I have agreed to live in this country, continue building businesses here and CONTINUE PAYING taxes instead of going to a more favourable country.
The Reality Principle is for an organism to accept their current position and understand that to get ahead it falls squarely on them to improve their life and their families future (Work harder, escape a bad country, die fighting for your children, protest, learn, ask for help, cooperate, etc).

I'm saying the end game is p2p payments for billions of people handling billions of transactions per second.  LN will help with that down the road.
Right now, our big battle is getting subverted by banks and governments.  If we do not have massive merchant adoption, then we're fucked.
On the contrary, the banks have now patented key LN technology and have invested heavily into paying the Bitcoin Core developers daily bread via Blockstream Inc which in-turn is owned by Digital Currency Group Inc.  
My thinking is that we've all been duped from "P2P payments and store of value" to "Digital gold".  LN was supposed to be ready last year and it looks to be nowhere close (months out if not a year more).

No shit. I would NEVER even question for a moment what I should do. Let alone ask Reddit on how to make decisions in my own life.

Bitcoin is a protocol. 
It is not decided on which news site declares (by 'fiat') what is what.
Nakamoto Consensus is all we need to decide this game and not need human beings to decide this.

8 Cents? I just sent $16,000 USD for 2 cents of BCH. **And even that's too high for a large part of the world**
It's easy to cherry pick examples when network congestion finally cleared up. However we are at the limit of 1MB blocks for a while now and need a scaling solution to keep fees low.
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:32:34
How nice that it's these 3rd party intermediaries such as exchanges and wallets *that we need to trust to implement them* before we can scale.
Can Bitcoin not scale on it's own or requires big corporations and banks to do the work for it?

Common Law is not just a gf in most parts of USA and Canada. It is certainly "married together" and has legal consequences.
We can agree to disagree that your wife, business partner, friend, children need to know your complete net worth.
We can also agree to disagree on what makes a marriage a good one.
Since I'm a behaviouralist, I will side with:
- Healthy children
- Mutual respect and care
- Appreciation
- Longevity (a marriage that ends in 15 years is not a good one IMO)
- Maintained attraction and desire
- Honest communication
On the last point: You can still be honest but choose what you disclose and when.  I do not go around describing the texture of the shits I take cuz "Open and honest communication".  That has no bearing on her future.
Likewise, whether I have *more than enough* to provide for her or *extremely more than enough* to provide for her results in no actionable outcomes that are positive (Unless you consider adding an economic incentive to your relationship for her to divorce you is considered positive).

The Bitcoin mining distribution chart in 2012 looks an awful like the Bitcoin Cash mining distribution TODAY.
Of course BCH is as centralized as BTC was 5 years ago.  Because Bitcoin was SET BACK 5 YEARS...
It's absolutely amazing to me, that "fake" Satoshi is dismissively listed as Dr.Wright on the Bitcoin Cash side as if it is no big deal. The creator of Bitcoin is on that team and swiftly dismissed. After 3 days of research, I'm convinced he's most likely Satoshi after all.
Have you read his publications and research papers? I'm a computer science major with 20+ years experience and find the technology behind Compact Blocks and Graphene amazing. This will allow us to trivially get to 32MB block sizes with almost no impact on decentralization.
What's shocking to me, reading over the past few days, is that Craig Wright...NEVER WANTED TO REVEAL HIS IDENTITY.
He did it in such a way...to give plausible deniability and at the same time tell the truth.  In effect, he appeased the Australian Tax Office and all the people on the darkweb that was threatening him and his families life.
It was a sheer brilliant move to "come out once" and sign in private to convince 3 others. But maintain plausibily deniability.  In short: He wanted people to call him a fraud.  He does not give a shit because he's sitting on 6B+ worth of BTC and about 1B+ of BCH as of this writing.
I'm a 2013 hodler of BTC (and therefore BCH automatically).  Where are the FACTS? This article is slim on them and cherry picking evidence, and yet presents very little of its own.
@_date: 2017-11-18 07:38:21
To an extent, yes. I'm not pure capitalism and libertarian.
I see my taxes as a way of "forced charity" to help others and I'm OK with that as the Social Contract, so to speak.
I think the balance should be more...linear and not have the top 20% pay 95% of all taxes -- but I would still rather live in North America vs. some other country for now.

First of all, it matches exactly the definition of what the *Bitcoin protocol is*.
A SegWit coin has a different Nash equilibrium and results in high fees/gatekeepers.
Bitcoin.com is owned by someone that chose to fork off, since that's what Bitcoin Core said to do: Fork off. And they did.
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:37:35
Bitcoin is a *decentralized p2p currency protocol*.


Bitcoin Core team does not own the definition of what a 'Bitcoin' is. That's utter bullshit and you are appealing to authority and decree (by fiat).
Bitcoin IS a protocol and Nakamoto Consensus determines the result. The end justifies the means.
Just because Bitcoin Core owns the domain bitcoin.org, does not mean IT IS BITCOIN.
Bitcoin is a protocol once again.
Trust that Nakamoto Consensus will help us settle this in the long term during this evolutionary/genetic algorithm that is playing out.

Only Bitcoin Cash is around now in any meaningful sense.
The original Bitcoin whitepaper by Nakamoto expected block sizes to be increased gradually to support extra capacity.
It's the most long-sighted plan there is in Bitcoin.  
If transactions cannot scale on-chain, then it leads to centralization at the payment hubs.  Lightning networks can easily be attacked with Sybil attacks.
However, block sizes have been proven publicly to scale just fine to 1GB blocks today and they about to release research showing they have tested 320GB blocks successfully.

Sure they can take a sledgehammer to your knee to get your private keys. But it sure is a lot harder to confiscate it than freeze all your bank accounts.
A number of governments will adopt Bitcoin as their main currency within the next 10 years. Other governments will try to control it.

I'm in one of the hottest markets. I know exactly how you feel.
Some choice (butchered) quotes (Millionaire Real Estate Investor, Rich Dad Poor Dad, etc.)
"Every market, at every time has its share of good investments"
"Real estate is unlike stocks and other investments. There are human factors that provide opportunities that cannot go away in any market (divorces, estate sales, death, loss of job, new child, etc)"
"Deals are created, never found"
Make yourself this promise: Never buy a property that does not provide net cashflow at least $1/month. It's OK if you it loses $50/month, but you can see that the rents are undervalued, etc.
I've been doing this for a few years now -- and every single week I learn something very important and profound. Literally that results in more dollars in my pocket and new opportunities that seemed like solid concrete walls or opaque black boxes just melt away. Get Creative.

Bitcoin is a protocol/network and competition is healthy.  
If either BTC or BCC gets captured (via centralization or whatever due to their own peculiarities) then at least there is the "other" that we can fall back on.
BTC has risks of being captured via gatekeepers to various LN hubs.
BCC has risk of being captured via massive centralization of miners.
WE stand to benefit by having options. Hold both and trust in the protocol and Nakamoto Consensus.

It won't continue to grow when half the world lives off $3/day or less.

My point is that the Bitcoin Core team pushed this, as much as others did. They are the ones access to the code base, and the ones that blessed Garzik's code.
The next question is....what other vulnerabilities exist in Segwit that we have not discovered.
There is no stable Nash Equilibrium with Segwit if all miners do not accept Segwit.

If he was in before the fork (BCH) -- which sounds like he was, then he's fine.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:51:50
It was shown that 99.8% of miners already can support 4 MB blocks as of last year 2016.
When they are 100% filled, then we will be up to about 25 tx/second. Which means we are now faster than Paypal and have achieved a significant milestone.
By then LN will be ready.

That sounds like a great deal with BTC transaction fees are $10-$30.
