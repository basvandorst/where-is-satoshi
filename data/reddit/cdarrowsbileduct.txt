This is a fascinating examination of the power of networks and how markets function.

Same with guns, people use that argument to support their preconceived notions.  
@_date: 2018-02-11 16:19:29
Yep, the only purpose of a gun is to shoot paper targets.  
Oh, did you mean something else? 
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:04:41
Agreed. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:04:23
Tell me, where will you find your angels to run your first and only not corrupt government?  
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:20:29
LOL!  
You still don't understand your error...

I bought 5 100 Trillion dollar bills on ebay for like $3.  lol!

Propose away, who is going to pass that law?  The people who are getting billions of dollars?  
Who is going to enforce that law?  
See the problem yet? 
@_date: 2017-10-17 01:11:21
All of them.  
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:48:03
How?

Yes, logic does exist in all markets.  Markets are just groups of people buying and selling products and services.  
Logic exists for each individual making choices based upon their subjective values for their subjective reasons. 
You just need to know more data than you presently have.

You believe in magic - why?

You mean, when government guaranteed slavery, passed laws to protect slave owners, and viewed slaves as not human?  
Without government, there would never have been slavery.

Just typically any more effort I expend wont change anything.  Reread what I said, it's all there.

That's because these models are not designed for prediction, they designed for theories of observed phenomenon.  
Same with climate change models, economics, elections, on and on and on.

Everything you need to know about how you don't understand economics or human action is summed up in this one quote.  
You believe a "market" is a thing that exists, thinks, reasons, has sakes, rights, duties, etc.  A "Market" doesn't exist.  It is a descriptive label about a group of individuals.  
Anyway, the explanation for your broader point is: 
1) You're wrong and it's not a Ponzi scheme. 
2) You're right, but those involved believe they can still get some benefit out of it. 
3) You're right, but those involved are subject to the gambler's paradox and don't yet understand it.  
People fall for scams all the time - during their period of ignorance, their actions are logical based upon the information available to them or within the narrow scope of their myopia (willful or not).  Their actions are rational when you consider the data they're basing their actions upon.  Taking their choices out of context is unhelpful and doesn't say anything about whether their actions are rational or irrational.  
A Buddhist monk cutting his penis off is irrational to us.  To him, he believes it will help him achieve his goal of denying desire. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:10:03
Yes, we do. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 00:56:02
Wow.  You don’t know understand anything.  
If I buy a “bag” of grain that is 10 pounds for $10 and then a 10 pound bag costs $12.  That means it costs more.  
But if at first it costs $10, then a 20 pound bag costs $11, that’s not a cost increase.  
With the iPhones and other smartphones, you’re getting more for a slightly higher cost.

Just need to get rid of government.  
FTFY.

Thanks to greed.
