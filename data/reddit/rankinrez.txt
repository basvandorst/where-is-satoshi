It runs a routing protocol not dissimilar to how routers in ISPs know where to send your data.
(Note: ISPs are centralised with "tiers" and a small number of globally connected large players dominating the network, it very much is centralised.)

It wouldn't.  Blocks larger than 1Mb are needed now, lightning will never work without larger blocks.
So BCH is not incompatible with lightning by any means, nor automatically against it.
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:21:24
There are issues with the routing though.
Djikstra / Bellman-Forde algorithms won't scale so it can be a global peer-to-peer network.  This is well known from the internet where BGP emerged and network hierarchy of "tier 1/2/3" carriers evolved to create workable global network.
Even if that routing was solved the issue with enough people keeping channels sufficiently funded to route payments will likely prevent a true peer-to-peer network.
Inevitably large hubs / clearing-houses will emerge.  That's fine, but you have to *trust* these guys.  Unless you want to be connected all the time and watch for shenanigans.

I'm fairly well versed and don't really feel it does.
Care to ELI5?
@_date: 2018-01-21 10:38:57
True enough.  Main reason I don't understand the "anti blocksize increase" but "pro Segwit" stance some people have taken.
Bigger blocks are needed one way or the other, whether that's with Segwit or a straight blocksize increase doesn't matter.

You wouldn't use BTC to pay in Starbucks anyway.  Fees to high.
You'd either use fiat or an alt.
So not sure what difference this makes.
@_date: 2018-01-27 15:56:40
You don't need to understand public key cryptography to understand Starbucks cards.
Bitcoin is a little trickier for non techy folks to get their head around.
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:16:17
Agreed, the trust is only needed if you don't remain connected all the time.
I expect that for the "common man" use-case staying connected won't be a popular option.
@_date: 2018-01-27 15:51:52
You contradict yourself.
Bigger blocks might mean miner centralisation, but it's still a way to scale.  You might think it's an undesirable outcome but it's not a technical issue.

17 hours eh??
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:59:16
That's the maximum they've seen.
£2 is still petty expensive, more than credit card fees for example.

Is it not more likely that big financial companies will end up running these hubs? As opposed to say, Nike or other retailers?
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:17:25
Yes exactly.
The key thing is what software the miners run.  If they *all* switch then the old chain basically dies off.  There have been several other protocol upgrades / forks in the past where this happened.
However if a relatively big chunk stay mining each chain (as happened with Bitcoin Cash), then the two chains continue to grow as separate entities.
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:11:32
That's how a hard fork happens - some users change their software and some don't, creating two incompatible chains.

At the time the size of a full WAV was excessive given the data networks and storage technologies of the time (late 80s / early 90s).  Hence the MP3.
Downloading 8Mb in 10 minutes is possible for almost anyone in 2017 though, so can't see any comparison here to justify 1Mb blocks.
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:59:38
The difference is now it's no longer even feasible (due to volatility/fees/confirmation time.)
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:25:29
Fair explanation I think.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:49:50
The 1Mb block limit means the network cannot process all the unconfirmed transactions.  This causes in fee inflation as people submit higher fees to try and get their transition included in the next block.
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:33:12
Thanks for the link to the Greg Maxwell post.
Extremely informative, although the biggest conclusion has to be that bigger blocks are totally feasible.  He does raise concerns about centralisation but in general massive progress has been made to allow large blocks easily propagate in time.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:08:32
A lot of BCH supporters are not convinced that it can scale indefinitely on chain.  
What is clear is that it can accommodate the current demand on-chain, giving us more time to look for solutions.
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:49:58
Thanks for the insight (and also the great work on OpenBizarre!).
If it was me I would be the exact same, changing now to only have to rework again in a short time is not going to appeal to many devs.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:10:20
Look absolutely there are different approaches.  It's good if we can keep it civil.
Both sides have their share of folks who at this stage treat their views on scaling almost like a religious belief, and aren't interested in looking honestly at the tech.
No solution currently on the table is without drawbacks or compromises.  That is the very nature of such problems.

Baud is actually the number of effective _symbols_ per second, This depends on the modulation technique used but will always be relative to the data rate (measured in bps).
Most overhead is in the form of bits at higher layers (such as start/stop, packet headers etc.).  In the case of a V.92 “56kbit” modem the term literally does mean 56 kilobits per second, and in the bit, not baud, rate.

Can you not use a DNS name and dynamic dns?
Needing a static IP seems very limiting.

Latency is why a website takes so long to download from China.
However downloading a 1GB block, once the first bytes start arriving after 300ms, should be able to go fairly fast, provided the TCP stacks both sides are configured to work well under high-latency conditions.

This is just a specific instance of the “lack of adoption” - “crypto impractical for general use” story we hear.

Regardless of your views on anything else bringing patent restrictions to bear is a bad thing for Bitcoin / Crypto in general.
Software patents are bad for software and technology in general for that matter.

Because he did.  But he didn't sign anything publicly, a trivial 1 minute task, which would prove it beyond any doubt forever.
Clearly a stunt IMO.  Doesn't sound like Satoishi, who would understand that people would want real proof.  He probably just wrote custom versions of the tools and doctored the entire thing.
I trust Dan Kaminsky's assessment that it was "intentional scammery."

That is some dodgy advice right there.

People are funny.
If you want them to switch from fist then crypto has to be *at least* as convenient to use, if not more so.
Orienting the phone camera for the qr code is more hassle than just waving the phone for nfc.

Which basically means it’s still crazy volatile.  Which is a major problem.
Imagine the Euro to Dollar rate swung as widely?  It’d be tricky to conduct business.
