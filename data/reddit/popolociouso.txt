Oh ya. I'm super pissed. I'm about to snap and stuff like that. I just yelled out loud, it was crazy. Thanks for the technical analysis. I find you guys are just so accurate on that, and it's definitely never just in your own self interest, so your post is very useful to all of us. Most of the people here have already no doubt moved over to LTC on your recommendation. And here I thought we were forming a double dipsee doo triangle button overlay pattern. Shows what I know! Thanks again, so much.

Better to post this in actively monitors there, and may reply. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:05:46
Got it. Your post up there then is just a bunch of guess work then. That's what I figured. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:54:19
...Or, any wealth, then. Guess the rich should live as the poor...Or else watch out! 
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:43:37
True on most points. But I'm going to disagree strongly that a tshirt or a license plate means one will be robbed by some dude with a brain the size of a pea for the few hundred I may or may not actually have accessible. Most people who have millions are smart enough to have it locked up. If they actually have that stored in their house and easy to get to, well then they are clearly the ones with pea brains.
I'd sure hope they'd at least have a dummy account. Give them that, not your real one. How the hell would they know how much you have. 
In the end, owning anything of value could make you a target. Not just bitcoin. And if you are wicked dumb then ya, it's a slight possibility you'll lose it. And it's an even slighter possibility they will get actually away with it. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:35:29
Point out where I cried please.
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:24:28
Why do you come here? Is your aim to piss people off by saying dumb and incorrectly slanted things? You need to find a more productive way to spend your free time. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:30:17
Wow. Case in point. 
And hey, thanks for the concern, but I've already cashed out an insane amount of fake internet money. I'm doing just fine. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:25:32
How does a would be thief know how much crypto I have exactly? Maybe I spent it on that car, and have none left? Maybe I have it stored across many banks making it way harder to steal than someones nice painting or whatever? Maybe I just like the t-shirt. That's one fucked up dumb ass  individual that's going to take a risk trying to rob me, expecting that I have millions in crypto just sitting in a hardware wallet in my garage ready for you.
There's a reason the known crypto rich aren't robbed daily. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:41:12
Wow. You need some work.
Yikes. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:16:53
You still dipping into the new years booze over there? 
@_date: 2018-01-29 11:21:14
Right. If someone is going to put a gun to my head and somehow magically force me to then go to multiple banks to recover my seed words (all the while not being caught, of course) for a random unknown amount of bitcoin which I may or may not even own, then feel free. Also, you'd just get my fake account after your several days of work, which has dick all in it. Oh, and you'd get a lot of jail time too, more so if this turns into some kind of crazy hostage thing. Some criminal masterminds there. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:30:40
Good for them, bad for us. So I'm gonna say no. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:21:11
Sure that's entirely possible. So what? People make dumb choices with money all the time. They are old enough to make up their own minds. I'm guessing they weren't investing their life savings here. Tell them not to buy then. Tell them to do some research first. I really don't care and I'm not sure why we're talking about your mum and her friends. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:17:25
Man your post history is all about "sell now it's a bubble I did and I'm better off cause it's going  to crash" and so on, and so on... That great, it may crash. Who knows. But why are you here spewing that over and over again? What's the point of that? Do you think you are helping us in some way? Seems like there's an ulterior motive at play. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:27:07
I think this is worse. But I don't know where the top is or how far away we are from finding out. I don't know how low it will drop when it does, or how long it'll stay there. And for all I know a few years later it may be at a new ATH again. There's no way to know.
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:04:34
You're entirely correct. My point is only it can be pretty secure if you want it to be.  I know if I had a large sum I'd be quite cautious. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:10:45
PS I wore my homemade shirt last night. So far, still alive and not robbed. Should I put my address on it or something? I'm thinking the kind of complete idiot that's going to try something won't be smart enough to find me otherwise. Or maybe they can't even read. Scratch that. A map maybe. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:49:07
Ah. You're a troll. Ok. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:55:20
So.. You're wicked rich? Why are you even still here with the amount of money you have? I mean, I have to assume you must be in the top few in the world? Lucky you! Or are you just making shit up here. Wait a sec... 
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:25:52
Who does that though? That's like me spending my spare time on some forum of some stock I bought and sold in the past, and then telling everyone a bunch of junk that may or may not be even true. It's nonsensical. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:57:11
I'll bet much more than my life. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:46:07
I have an idea I can follow through on. I'll buy a shirt right now that says "I have a million dollars in bitcoin, locked up in a safe vault. Also I'm not an orphan". Then, I'll wear it for the next year (2?), and I'll go out of my way to hit up the sketchy areas, making sure the shirt is completely visible. We can touch base  anytime and I'll be happy to provide you with the number of robbery attempts and their respective outcomes. This will be fun! 
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:24:37
Well what then?  Can't be ethereum yet. They aren't nearly close to ready to handle the potential load. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:20:51
It's easier to follow a Trezor and a public ledger.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:53:58
This whole scenario is hellarious. I love it. You have quite the vivid imagination. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:30:46
And I call the police. At this point, with this level of crime, me getting seed words or money from a bank is indistinguishable. This is far beyond the method of payment. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:19:51
Really... That's the biggest problem? In any case, if I am told to walk into a bank and pull out a Trezor with a million dollars of bitcoin from my safe deposit box, or just a million dollars in cash.. As the robber, hey, just bring me the cash. Makes life a lot easier. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:12:45
Mostly because they are not being pushed. They haven't solved scaling either. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:43:25
Same way criminals are caught. Oh wait, are these guys super pro uncatchables now too? Damn! Plot twist! I guess they are already criminal masterminds so right, makes sense. These are the best of the best! The ultra elite! And they are after me! Do you have movie rights on this yet? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:10:28
Oh. Clearly my bad. With all that "so easy"  and "rinse and repeat" etc type talk above one has to assume you own this game hands down. Why use lunch money if you're so confident? You could obviously be super wealthy by now. It's fool proof, from the sounds of it. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:58:37
That whole thing is bs. And incredibly rare. Getting his actual cash money would've been just as easy for the bad dudes, assuming he had his cryptcoins locked in a  bank vault anyway, which is my entire point. Lock up your shit. Spread your seed words across multiple banks. Give them a wallet with $1000 in it and say you spent the rest, that's all you have left. Whatever. It can be just as secure as anything else. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:03:27
I've also sold on the way up, over the last while. I also got in early like you. I've also made a lot of money from this venture. I also don't like high transaction fees. But I don't pretend to know what's going to happen next, and I certainly don't repeat it over and over and over again. We differ there. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:54:14
That's one of many, many ways. You make it sounds like following cash money is the only way to catch people. You are just being more and more ridiculous now. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:40:31
They might just as well just ask you for cash at this point. They've broken a few serious laws already. Pretty sure this won't end well for them. That's some jail time. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:52:50
There are many well known millionaires. So far, none of them have been robbed. Unless it's some kind of failed insider attempt. I'm also putting myself out there dangling and waiting. Maybe I don't actually have a million dollars but my shirt says I do. Time will tell, and we'll see what happens here. I'm guessing your far fetched criminal theory ends as totally laughable. It's almost insane.
I can't wait to be told "hey go into your bank and get your seed words or else we'll get your mom real good". Uh huh. Like that's gonna happen. And if it does I'm giving you my wallet with $1000 cause that's all I have, the rest was spent on this shirt, robber sir. Prove otherwise. Also I'm calling the police. Let's see how this plays out. 
You've watched a lot of tv. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:51:04
That's insane. Who are these crazy murderers?! Why are there so many of them all looking for us? And why are they doing all this for a measly million dollars which may or may even exist? I mean, murder and everything? I'm so glad I've never been abducted and murdered yet by thee elite criminal masters!  And they never get caught either? Fucking amazing (bull)shit right there. 
Give me a break. Where do you guys live for this to be happening? Geezus, talk about far fetched. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:25:03
Haha! That is truly crazy! You really made me laugh with that one. Nice! These people are now going to jail for murder. It gets worse and worse for them. Just when I thought this scenario couldn't get any more imaginative. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:40:47
Wow. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:02:38
I'll bet my own life you're either batshit crazy or just tyring to pull my leg. No one can be this dumb and alive. A plant maybe. Not an actual person. Wait, you some kind of troll bot? Nice! 
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:37:43
Again, it's clear you've missed the entire point of bitcoin. No doubt you sound the same to me as your mum sounded to you. I'm glad you've made some money but you might want to move on.
PS you don't have to buy a full bitcoin...??? But I'm sure you know that, so not sure why you're writing garbage. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:19:51
No. I'm instead out to prove that you're crazy. No one would try to pull off this elaborate heist. What, some mastermind criminal here? Give me a break. I'm doing it anyway, let's see where your theory goes here.
I hear this crap all the time "oh he has a bitcoin licence plate he's a huge target". It's fucking stupid. You're better off trying to steal the car than trying to abduct the guy or his family and then trying to force him go into a bank and pull out his seed words for you. Ya.... Right... Big opportunity here. It's happening everywhere. It's super easy.
You'll be in jail real fast. And for a very long time. Have fun.
Not to mention I could have dick all left in bitcoin. Or maybe I have 12 Trezors, and I give you just one to make you happy. There are so many easy solutions to your problem here it's insane. You don't know what I own or where. Be realistic dude. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:41:20
Partial seed words stored across multiple banks. Super easy to rob. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:39:31
Wait.. They drag me into a bank all messed up and force me to open my safe deposit box and hand them the contents and no one bat's an eye at any of this? Just regular bank stuff over here. Nothing to see. No robberies or anything going on. Move along.
I guess this is why it happens all the time. It's so damn easy. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:52:23
I've been around for here for four years. I know all about this. But I hear cash is also pretty easy to handle. In fact, much easier. They are already in jail either way. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:17:51
Hypothetically is right. I agree. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:09:45
That's... Not what it's based on. You have successfully missed the point. You and many others these days..
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:41:46
Don't waste your time Wha, that dude is out to lunch.
