I may be naive to the proper protocol for writing and publishing a white paper, but is it not theoretically possible for a white paper to be published before every conceivable aspect has been finalized and detailed?

Is this true?  Can you provide any citation?


That's the entire objective.  Bitcoin evangelizing is just as much about encouraging merchants to accept it as it is getting consumers to spend it.  Exchanging Bitcoin for goods and services means you don't have to exchange it for another currency first.

I have to leave a comment here because I think bitsoldi makes a controversial point, but one that is slowly gaining some support.  I'll agree with a commenter below that bitsoldi built a straw man argument, but that doesn't mean it's an invalid one.
Most societies in the developed world are passionately in love with human incarceration, and I, along with many libertarians, feel that it is an issue that needs to be dramatically rethought.  
I'm not going to get into the details of what a near-jail-free society would look like, but keep in mind that the only reason people support the idea of human incarceration is because it's the only one of very few preconceived notions we have of how a society is supposed to respond to "bad guys".  We need to come to terms that prison doesn't fix the criminal and it doesn't offer restitution to the victim; it only perpetuates crime.  There is a better way.
Furthermore, I believe that the blockchain may have solutions and/or alternatives to our current, broken criminal justice system.

This is an idea I've been mulling for a while, too!  Looks well-executed!
So, what would be the next step for a business?  What if a small business wanted to proceed in accepting Bitcoin?  What role would PledgeBitcoins.com play in advising that business toward that goal?
Here's an idea I'd like to see discussed: a cryptocurrency adoption consultation network.  This could be a conglomeration of agents representing payment processing firms like Coinbase, Coinkite, BitPay, etc., and even local volunteers who PledgeBitcoins.com could use as a resource to mentor businesses through the process of implementation.  I think that could really accelerate adoption.

Who said a central authority can be the only entity that conducts an investigation?  You propagated that idea, not OP.
This idea that those of us in the community who are libertarian, anarchist or minarchist and whom also want an investigation into MtGox's actions aren't necessarily asking for regulation.

I have to say, I'm pretty irritated with Jason on his representation of Bitcoin.  The only knowledge he displayed was the assessment of it being a risky investment. Uh, yeah. You learn that day one in the Bitcoin community.  Search: "don't invest more than you can afford to lose".
He goes on to boast that he predicted the 30% loss as if that's something to boast about.  If he knew anything about Bitcoin, he'd know that any reasonable prediction has a good chance of becoming reality on any given day; especially on a day in which the SEC made a significant ETF ruling.
He then went out of his way to slam the user base--the "apologists--and discuss "all the ways Bitcoin can screw you" (he didn't), but never once demonstrated an understanding of the disruptive qualities of the technology &amp; why it continues to gain popularity.
Oh, and three times now he's referred to a bitcoin as "an ounce".  Come on.

I guess I'll be the one to say it--despite not being an investment consultant:  It depends on your purpose for investing.
Gold is traditionally a long-term store of value: low risk, low reward.   It will hold value against most markets, and gain value against inflationary currencies.
Bitcoin is high risk and high reward.  I think most of us here at are perpetually bullish; because we believe in the technology and the philosophy for which it stands.  However, that doesn't change the fact that it could cost you every dime you invest.  
If you're a good investor, you'll invest in both and more.  Diversify, diversify, diversify.

I presume this is largely driven by businessmen and women who have been at a curious distance for a while and saw The Economist today for the first time.  I'm hoping they get in and get out with a little profit.  They're the ones who need to be talking about Bitcoin and optimistic about the rise of cryptocurrency.  
If average Joe's can get in and get out of the Bitcoin market, then they can spend bitcoins--and that's great for widespread adoption.

So, one thing I can't figure out regarding that accusation.. He wasn't charged with those crimes in this case.  From what I understand, those allegations are pending in Maryland's state courts.  If he hasn't been convicted in any court of law on those allegations, why were they permitted as evidence in this case?
Furthermore, what if there were multiple DPR's as Ross' defense claims?  The only way Ross could be vindicated would be for someone else to confess.  I have a problem with that, because the burden of proof should not be on Ross' defense, it should be on the prosecution.

I'm really getting tired of mainstream analysts pointing to "it's a deflationary currency" and "scarcity" as flaws in the Bitcoin structure.  Like, really tired of it.
I'm no economist, but I simply don't understand what they're trying to say.  In my opinion, these are two aspects of Bitcoin that make it *stronger*.
First of all, every currency is deflationary.  Every single one.  I can't find an example of a currency that hasn't deflated over time.  Having a known deflationary curve built in to the structure of currency seems like an advantage to me.  *Isn't eliminating uncertainty one of the most valuable concepts to an economist*?  The US has proven for years that a deflating currency won't necessarily aggravate a national economy.
Finally, this author suggests that because only 21 million units will ever be in circulation that this is somehow a negative attribute.  How?  Is he forgetting that each unit can be split to 1/10000000 of a unit?  Also, he knows that scarcity is what gives gold and (falsely) diamonds their value, right?  Having a finite number of units gives added security to the overall value of Bitcoin.
Those are only two of the many, many foolish claims this fella made.  I shouldn't have finished the article, honestly.

You might be right, but your comment doesn't really stay in context with the point to which I was trying to draw a attention.
OP didn't specify the ages.  He was merely pointing out that it wasn't just young people, but "older" people who were intrigued.  
My further point is: it is imperative for the growth and overall acceptance of Bitcoin that new Bitcoin technology be aiming to reel in the lay person; and that's exactly what has happened here.
Edit:  TL;DR - I'm more praising the fact that Bitcoiniacs has reached the average end-user than focussing on the actual age of said user(s).

Maybe the Bitcoin community should put our money where our mouth is.  I'm not sure how to execute the logistics, but what if there was an address out there that had been promised to Wikipedia as soon as they began accepting?  Someone at Wikipedia would be watching it fill up.
It sounds a little like bribery, but it would definitely help them understand the level of interest and give them an idea of the donations they could expect from our eager community. 
I'd be willing to host the address, but how would I be able to promise that I wasn't going to steal all the funds moved there?

Somewhat of a snide comment... but... I'll take it..?

My friends can't say this to me.  They can only blame themselves.

A little pessimistic, don't you think?  ;)

I guess I should have titled it 'Satirical Appeal of a Homeless Man Regarding Bitcoin'.  
Is there no imagination in the Bitcoin space?  Jesus..

I literally lol'd and it echoed loudly off the four walls of my bathroom.

Sure, but my hesitation with gift cards is the fact that I am storing cash not only in USD, but in reserve for only a specific retailer.  With a universally accepted payment processor, I am still storing money in USD, but it's not likely to stay in limbo very long that specific retailer doesn't have the diapers my baby needs.

This was my first thought, I just don't know how the mechanics of an exchange being down would throw the whole price like that.

I would say in most cases comment karma isn't indicative of a person's real-life contributions to society, but in your case, it likely is.

I liked it.  Well done.

I agree.  And personally, I kinda dig the romantic mystery of it all.  I hope we never find out.

Dang, small world!  I'm just down the road in SW MO.  I might have to pay a visit!

Would someone please explain and cite the reason(s) for the disdain toward Amir Taaki?  I really think he's one of the best minds in the Bitcoin space, but maybe I missed something...
@_date: 2013-11-15 05:10:03
I'd probably be in favor of this.  But maybe we should take up a vote to elect a chancellor or magistrate.

I can't speak from personal experience, but it seems like I have been reading about Berlin being a hot spot for Bitcoin.   There's a [conference happening there]( [bars accepting BTC]( and it seems to be leading the charge in [brick-and-mortar merchants accepting BTC](
I would say the public is very warm to it, but like many places, regulation is the looming question.

Well, I was considering an Armory wallet until this fella got the shit downvoted out of him.  
Can anyone explain why he got downvoted?  Did he commit a reddiquette faux pas?
@_date: 2013-11-09 04:43:31
That's fantastic.  Thanks for sharing.  Thanks for the tip!  I have no idea how to accept it, but I'll figure it out and tip it forward.
@_date: 2013-11-05 05:05:06
Honestly, this was my first reaction.
A horror story like this is enough to scare anyone (like myself) with an amateur knowledge-level right the fuck the door.
So your theory definitely has legs simply because of the implied motive.
Either way, I hate seeing this post.

A Wal-mart gift card would be a good way to satisfy my needs temporarily... except, I hate Wal-mart and I refuse to give them my money.

I was just about to make a similar comment.   My thoughts exactly.
@_date: 2013-10-30 22:50:38
I was just trying to be sensitive to the vast minority of female Bitcoin enthusiasts while also acknowledging that it's rare (and delightful) to see a young and charming woman discuss it.

Damn, you beat me to posting this..
I was going to post with the title: "We should start r/BitcoinBuffoons; this should be the first link".
What an embarrassment to ZDNet.  This guy doesn't have a clue.

I looked at these charts a few times over the last couple of months and it is interesting, but not really surprising.  The only supposition the correlation of the charts really supports is that Bitcoin's value is (currently) driven almost entirely by speculation.  
I'm not losing sleep.  Wake me up when Bitcoin's value is driven by its functionality and not the speculation of ignorant wannabes in search of a get-rich-quick scheme who don't understand the first thing about the space.

As a hypothetical parent, I would allow my child to invest a little and keep a close watch, especially if it's his/her *spending* money.  I'd be incredibly proud, actually.  
However, I'd set the pretext that he/she had to invest in couple of other things in order to get a well-rounded idea of what is actually happening with each store of value.  Perhaps one commodity, one risky stock and Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2013-10-18 17:39:54
This could be exactly what I'm looking for.  However, I'm a little skeptical since I've never heard about it.   It seems to me that if the product does what it appears to suggest, it would be huge news in the Bitcoin space.

I think "stop-gap" Bitcoin start-ups like this are a crucial addition to the space.  However, they are only a stop-gap.  No tenant with half a brain is going to pay a bit over 0% once landlords start widely accepting Bitcoin.  
How does Rentulations project to adjust when this inevitability comes to fruition (likely to be sooner than later)?
@_date: 2013-08-30 22:06:33
My misunderstanding.  I apologize.
Still, my question remains, but I'll reword it: As Rentalutions builds a customer base that uses its service as a 3rd-party Bitcoin payment processor, how do they plan to adapt when a universal payment processing service (like a commercial-grade wallet with a built-in payment service) starts offering sub-1% fees?  Lowering/eliminating the fees to stay competitive?  Or is this Bitcoin service simply more of a supplemental service that won't make or break the company?
My point was more a blanket statement about companies that are starting to pop up like [Pizza for Coins]( that are a stop-gap payment processor in every sense of the term.  Clearly that's not what this service is, so again, sorry for the confusion.
