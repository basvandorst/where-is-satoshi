There was a football coach in Germany. He was about to become the coach of the national team, when rumours came up that he might be a cocaine addict. The coach called in a huge press conference, where he told everyone that he never used drugs and he'd agree to give hair samples to the authorities. And he did. And the samples showed that he was indeed a cocaine user.
I always asked myself why he did this. I think the answer is that some people tend to lose touch with reality. Having seen the boastful traces Wright left on the Internet\*, it's completely plausible that Wright thinks of himself as a genius that could get away with such a thing.

I think I know what video you're talking about. At the time I was browsing the website, it was already taken down, so I couldn't watch the demo. But there was a transcript available. I found the text to be as sketchy as everything else on that website:






Not to mention that the main focus lies on selling a "petabyte storage rack" but no pictures or videos exist of those things and they aren't mentioned elsewhere.

His junior staff was nervous because he had nothing to show. His cluster monitoring tool was a WebGL animation of the [World Population]( A Redditor on this sub debunked it, but the Reddit search fails me, so I can't give the original author the credit he deserves.

Which really is the only proof we have. The cluster might or might not exist. The list is curated by scientists in their free time. Make of it what you want. People get plagiarized papers into journals, maybe someone gets a faked entry into the Top 500 list.
Personally I find it very strange that he builds one of the biggest supercomputers in the world and you can't find any news of it. The same guy who gets the SGI director to comment on his crappy University lecture doesn't get SGI to do a press release when they build a Top10 HPC cluster in Australia.

Ask yourself: Would a company that can afford to build one of the worlds fastest supercomputer for a hundred million dollars just dissapear as soon as there's a tiny bit of publicity surrounding its CEO? Sketchy.
