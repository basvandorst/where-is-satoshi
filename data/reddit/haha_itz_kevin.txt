How many times did the ship already go down and come back up tho? I thought China ban was rough, but even after that, Chinese citizens are still trading peer to peer saying “fuck you, it’s my money” to the government.
I’m Korean, and tbh all I see from all this FUD and “emergency regulation” BS is just another government and wealthy class watching people freely moving around money and desperately trying to find a way to get their “cut” of the action.
You’d be shocked to know how easy it is for the top elites in Korea (Chaebol) to buy off the government at the drop of the hat and throw around stupid/unethical regulations disguised behind good intentions to strangle everyone else. Just like how things are in the USA.

Lulz. I like how he even added the little exclamation point, like how he always does when talking out his ass.
Last time I checked the vending machine a snickers bar was $1.25...

I think you just got a decent run and developed a hot hand fallacy.
Margin trading is straight up Russian roulette... with a double barreled shotgun. And you just pulled the wrong trigger.

No joke, some people probably lost more than what they could have liquidated to end up at zero... god help the poor bastard who lost 10mill. He’s probably on suicide watch.
