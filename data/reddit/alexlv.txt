I truly have no idea what your saying about language, I never talked anything about language... 
Sure the cost of the transaction is less, but maybe people that work hard for their crops, products don't wont virtual money. Maybe they would rather wont gold and silver which take time and effort to mine out of the ground, refine, process.

EXACTLY!! This ponzi scheme will come to an end as soon as people try to cash in for either dollars or products as their will be a whole bunch of people looking to either buy products or dollars and barely anyone to even buy, and then its bye bye. As every ponzi scheme you need more retards ever time to keep supporting the stupidity
@_date: 2013-02-13 21:30:25
In all of history theirs always been theft, you can't just live in fear. Liberty Dollars were given a legal value, and were basically implying legal tender. Which is why they were confiscated. 
It doesn't have to be a problem, maybe they want to keep in the certificate, and then convert that to cash way faster than getting a wire transfer to convert your Bitcoins to cash. 
The only Bullion dealers that accept Bitcoins buy the bullion in cash and sell it for a price way higher than spot price, just byy converting the Bitcoins when they accept them. Unless you honestly believe mints accept Bitcoins...

Funny enough their is a billion that put $2 billion of his own money into Gold. Haha some of the smartest minds in finance are going all in on Gold and Silver. Considering the Fed is printing $85 billion per month to keep the economy going and that it contracted by 0.1% in the 4th quarter, I'm going speculate on the collapse. Good luck to you

Yup I do, that's why most people are taking their money out of the fiat system... Because country's have to accept it...
Please look up the definition of fiat and then come back with a reply. Gold is absolutely not fiat, funny enough history tends to disagree with you with it being worthless. I wonder why central banks hold gold if its so worthless. Please check your logic. Yes except it took hard work to get the Gold.

I completely understand what fiat currency is. 
I believe people shouldn't be accepting paper money, it's robbing other country's of their products if we can just print it and give it to them... It has it value cause the government made it a law to accept their worthless paper.
I think it'll crash when people realize that other country's wont accept fiat currency or virtual money, and that they'll only accept food, silver, gold, oil, and other products for their stuff. Then they'll be no choice but to trade in your Bitcoins or starve to death.

Well yes Google has utility, but its definitely not worth $355.2 Billion, its in a huge bubble because of a big short squeeze, and low interest rates.
That's how I know its a value is intrinsically $0. It impossible to determine a real value because it doesn't do anything, and a tiny tiny percent of the world actually want it, which definitely is not enough to support the price if it falls. It's impossible to make a price target for bitcoin, because their is no reason for it to even have a price in the first place. 
Truly I actually enjoy it a lot when bitcoin makes new highs, because I know the majority of these retards aren't cashing in or buying products, just hoarding. And When this does collapse I will be even happier that some people will become millionaires at the expense of all these other retards that would've lost everything.

SLV barely contains silver they say the have. Silver will have a huge shortage. Sure Bitcoins are more scarce but its not supported by any fundamentals, except theirs very little of it. Silver is supported by the fact is always been seen as a form of money and that it's scarce, and many other factors for example a ton of technology involves silver to produce it. I'll wait until the day a lot of hedge funds buy Bitcoins.

I actually trade forex, and bonds and some stocks. Google is definitely a bubble, Apple is more fairly valued. The stock market in general is in a bubble because of low interest rates and cheap money coming from the federal reserve. Twitter's new IPO has sent it into bubble territory. 
I'm actually short twitter at $49.85, its trading at $40.90 at the moment now, so a trade well paid off. I don't define a bubble as prices rising quickly, but at something that is overvalued for what it offers/is. You obviously are saying that because something adds value to society it can never be a bubble, and your view doesn't really matter because from what I can tell you don't trade or invest in any stocks, but I do. 
Exactly, I'm a capitalist, I would never try to ban bitcoin, I'm just warning people, if they decide to not listen that's not my problem, time will prove I'm right, unless the government try's to accept it for payment of taxes, then I would be wrong.

@_date: 2013-11-28 21:36:32
Yeah well that noise could be counted as referrals. And no ponzi or pyramid scheme Guarantee's thing 100% they just say its extremely low risk. 
Yes because the government made it so that we had to pay our taxes in dollars, after the Nixon shock. Only reason fiat money has value is because its accepted for taxes and people believed the government wouldn't go crazy and start printing into infinity. But the dollar is losing value now that they are.
The volatility is in the dollar, not gold... It's considered as a store of value because back in the 1920's an ounce of gold would buy you a nice suit, and now in the 2013 it can still buy you a nice suit. This is how it is a store of value. Bitcoin has a 5 year history, so its obviously not a store of value, someone that claims it is, is a complete retard and fool.

I never said how much a Bitcoin would be worth. I said it's value is derived by what the people that buy the Bitcoin. For example a Tulip that cost 10 years the work of a skilled craftsman, and then it collapsed when people realized what they were holding.

@_date: 2013-02-12 22:00:20
That is the truth for commodities except for example gold and silver take time and effort to mine them out of the ground. It takes 10 years from when they find a silver deposit to have 1 oz of silver.

What the hell? You are forgetting all the gold shorts that aren't physically backed by anything... Which means they would have to bid up the price even more to acquire the physical gold they shorted. 
30,000 tons of gold sold to the market???!!!! WHAT who in the hell would do that? There would be no sudden influx sold, only the people that thought they had paper receipts of it trying to get the physical gold they thought they had, which would push the price up even more... 
To bad that most of the gold is hoarded by a small amount of people (like me), with no intent of giving it to every person in the US... I don't know if this was a joke or if you truly believe this, because this is the absolute most stupidest thing I've heard any Bitcoiner say.... And that's saying something LOL
@_date: 2013-02-12 21:02:21
Same thing could be said about gold and silver, when people realize they don't want to give up their hard earned crops, oil for fiat paper money theirs a more likelihood of them buying silver and gold.
 I wouldn't exactly call bitcoins a commodity. Definition: A raw material or primary agricultural product that can be bought and sold, such as copper or coffee. Same as silver, people throw away silver everyday. 
@_date: 2013-02-13 02:26:36
If that happens what makes you think that the mints will even accept Bitcoins for Precious metals, considering they went through a lot of work to get it, maybe they don't want virtual money.
@_date: 2013-02-13 00:33:56
All commodities are extremely undervalued in terms of paper money, of course oil should cost way more. McDonald's accept it because it is the Law to accept it.
@_date: 2013-02-13 03:15:56
Theirs a huge difference in computer processing power and people sometimes die while acquiring the Gold and Silver in the mines. 
Bitcoins are all pegged to the dollar/fiat currencys, just like Gold and silver currently is, except it should be the other way around and the dollar should be pegged to gold and silver. In the end Bitcoins will only be pegged to the dollar/fiat currency, their would be no logical reason for it to be the other way around. So sure you're bitcoins might be worth even $100 per bitcoin, but it doesn't matter when you measure it in inflated currency, when at the same price a movie ticket might cost $100. For this exact reason Gold has gone from $300/oz in the year 2000, to its $1653/oz now. You can take Zimbabwe for an example, $100 billion zimbabwe dollars would barely buy you 3 eggs. So sure you guys might be millionaires, but maybe at the same price you're bread will cost $10 million per loaf. Funny enough after their currency collapsed with the crazy amount of hyperinflation, now they all transact in gold and silver.
@_date: 2013-12-03 12:46:35
Well 10 years is a nice round number, so I would say 10 years at least. Remember that gold became money gradually over time, not at one specific date/time.
Well currency is obviously not what FinCEN defines it as, considering private banks use to issue paper currency...(not federal reserve) and they weren't designated as legal tender, Only gold and silver was designated as legal tender in the constitution. So FinCEN's definition doesn't really matter to me, nor to anyone that actually thinks, because its forgetting the countries history. 
Well I guess you can use that as a definition for money, but their is a lot of different definitions of money, but I can understand why you use this definition. But people use money because of stability, its just common sense.
Well Actually Bitpay accepts Bitcoins, merchants want dollars/local currency. Merchants aren't really accepting it, few are TRULY accepting bitcoin, they are just using bitpay to sell them and then pretend to be supporting bitcoin. 
Yes it does need more time, and it definitely is the best digital option at the moment. 
Thank you to.

@_date: 2013-12-03 10:56:14
Well It only has a 4 year history, this is absolutely no proof of being a store of value at all. Internet stocks could've also been called a store of value that increased by a ton, then they came crashing straight down.
First gold was a commodity, used all around the world. Then it became a become money gradually over time. 
Yes you are right about not being able to spend gold, but as we have seen from Zimbabwe a few years ago, when their currency collapsed, the only thing merchants would accept is gold. I agree with your statement at this current point in time, but It will change when the USD collapses, and I highly doubt anyone would accept Bitcoin for anything when the USD collapses, but time will tell.
Currency has all the things you stated. Money includes being a store of value.

All these bubbles are the same... Just with people coming up with different excuses to justify their stupid decisions. Nasdaq still hasn't recovered from its bubble, many stocks went to pennys, few survived. Internet millionaires became internet failures, because they never cashed in. 
It will never become the main form of currency in the world unless governments demand it for payment of taxes, which is highly doubtful as they are buying up gold, not bitcoins. It won't even be a currency used at all when the dollar collapses, its complimentary to the dollar, not against it (bitpay). 
Yet? Company's don't want it. Neither do their suppliers, and if they do accept it, they will be using bitpay like always, which fundamentally means that they still don't trust bitcoin and sell bitcoins for dollarss.
You should've just sent a western union transfer, gets their instantly/5 mins. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:11:16
Bitcoin is complimentary to the $, not against it, when the $ goes down so does bitcoin, as no one will sell you any agriculture products or gold and silver for bitcoins. The only reason they accept bitcoins for silver and gold right now is because of bitpayyy and how much the merchants want dollars and pretend to be supporting bitcoin lolololololol.
Only complete idiots would accept bitcoin for payment of goods. Which is why all these merchants use bitpay to convert it into dollarrsss $. You idiots think that circulating bitcoins by spending them on items will insure its survivability. But you are forgetting the most important part that when the merchants accept bitcoin, bitpay sells it for $ :) So it has the same effect on price, when you guys try to either cash it into $ or purchase an item just like those stupid Nasdaq bubble millionaires, except you guys are even stupider. So this $1000+ evaluation for bitcoin doesn't matter, because you guys have failed to cash in to $$$$$$$ or products. and when you guys decide to, well bitpay processing will insure it has the same effect as selling your bitcoins on the market... 
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:00:35
Their is no evidence whatsoever it will prevail through a financial crisis, this is a dream, no history to back your claim up that it will GUARANTEE the value. 
Yeah but unfortunately it misses the most important part about gold, it's intrinsic value that has survived for thousands of years. It doesn't matter how easy it is to transport if it has no value/no one accepts it for goods.

Gold sure doesn't have as much uses as silver. But it is used for something's, like space-crafts, even in the chips that your computer/phone is running on. It's an extremely reliable metal that doesn't corrode or rust. Making it a necessity in certain applications. But I do admit gold is more used for money and not appliances.
It comes from worthless fiat paper money. in the 1920's 1 oz of gold would get you a good suit. The price for 1 oz was $20. You can't get a good suit for $20 in these days. But for the same 1 oz you can still get a nice suit. That's were the value is coming from. People are going to be paying way more than $1600 for 1 oz. It's actually extremely undervalued compared to paper money that can be printed to infinity. Think about it for a while.

"There is no coming back to a gold as currency" YUP that's why central banks around the world are buying it! ;) for no reason whatsoever! 
Who needs gold? Central banks LOL. Yup Peter schiff and all these governments are delusional... You are an idiot, and have no proof bitcoin will work, gold has 4000+ years of history. You are so pathetic its hilarious. China just imported a record amount of gold this year because we aren't going back to gold as currency! :)
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:15:17
The whole point of gold is that it's not valued for its industrial use... Me and many other people couldn't care less if it has 0% industrial use. 
Governments/central banks hoard Gold, not bitcoin... If they announce that they will start hoarding bitcoin, then this would change the entire perspective. The reason we accept $ is because it is required to pay taxes... So if you don't wanna go to jail, you gotta pay in $. This stays true until economic conditions make it so bad that people no longer care about paying taxes, as in Zimbabwe. 
Why do you think central banks around the world are increasing their gold purchases? China just announced a week ago they would no longer buy US bonds. But they are importing a record level of gold this year. Why is this? Because when fiat collapses and things start to rebuild, governments will require gold for payment and know gold will keep its value, as it has for thousands of years.
This and the history of gold, how it's survived for thousands of years through economic collapse and retained its value. Also the amount of effort and work it takes to make an ounce of gold. These are the things that give it it's intrinsic value, It got it over time. But of course at the beginning of the world, gold doesn't have ANY intrinsic value. 
Bitcoin has absolutely none right now, not even the merchants trust it, which is why they use bitpay... Only idiots try to hoard them thinking that the rest of the world will "catch on" and that you guys will be millionaires. You guys shouldn't really trust these Chinese bitcoin purchases.... Their stockmarket has lost more money for investors than any other in the world.... and they think investing in their Ghost cities is a smart idea... lol, bitcoin has a $10 billion market share, twitter has a $22.28 billion market share, so bitcoin isn't really impressing anyone, except delusional people, like them Winklevoss Harvard educated brothers lololol

Yeah you would be, but it's always that "if". No government/central bank has done this, but China has imported records amounts of gold this year. If they demand gold for taxes in the future, you will have to sell your bitcoins for gold, at rock bottom prices, or might not even be able to sell it for gold. And if you don't you'll go to jail, won't be to hard, not that many people in the world that actually use Bitcoin. And this could very well be a possibility because central banks hoard gold, so this "if" is way more probable.

It actually has a ton of screaming people telling others it will go to $1,000,000. Saying it will be the future and will never fail is essentially a promise by every bitcoin advocate. You need new people coming in to buy bitcoin or it will collapse, it is a pyramid scheme. 
Paper money was easier to use then gold, but that never gave the paper its value, it came from the intrinsic value of gold and that the paper was a receipt for gold in a bank or vault somewhere. So medium of exchange doesn't give it a value...
It is obviously not a store of value considering the price is just wild, no one can predict the price, no one wants to use it as money cause its basically stupid to make any loan or lend with such a volatile price.

I understand your point, I'm happy that you don't have so much Bitcoins that it would affect your life. I guess I understand the investment if your only putting a small percentage worth of your money into it.

Yes not only a fool but an idiot. Didn't the same thing happen for the Nasdaq bubble? and during the tulip mania? It doesn't make you smart one bit. But if you have the intelligence to cash in to either dollars or products,agriculture,commodities then I congratulate you on a gamble well paid off, but it still doesn't make you smart.
As you see all these big merchants use bitpay, which is a pretty smart decision for them because they can easily say they support bitcoin while all they do is want dollars. They don't want to hold onto bitcoins lol

So can World of warcraft gold, or runescape gold, which actually do sell for dollars... Funny enough Runescape gold has more value it adds than bitcoin ever will.
Omfg It's a smaller market than even Twitter ($22 billion), holy shit you guys are stupid if you actually believe the world is excited, a tiny amount of people are getting into bitcoin cause the price is going up, as any bubble. People want the action and a fast quick reward.
Eh we don't "need" that. And after all you guys are only attributing it value based on dollars. How much of the transaction that go on for bitcoin involve selling bitcoins for gold instead of the dollars you guys so much hate? After all you guys are just giving it value in dollars, which will quickly disappear when many of the speculators that got in because the price is rising try to cash in and theirs barely anyone to take the other side of the trade/buy because only a tiny group of idiots wanted them in the first place and they already got in... So it collapses like any pyramid scheme.
Well of course we don't need just you to spend... It's not really about what you do, but what the bitcoin community does, which is that they are all hoarding it right now. Transferring bitcoins is the same as hoarding them, if the person that gets them decides to not use them either, which is what the majority of bitcoin holders are doing...
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:48:41
LOL WHAT? That would make the physical gold even more valuable if they discover fraud in the paper market LOL. People wouldn't be able to get their gold back in paper receipts but they would bid the price sky high with any commodity/money being used. People want gold for itself.
@_date: 2013-02-12 19:10:20
I never once said the government was our friend. The government tried to confiscate gold before because its a threat to their fiat paper money system.  Yes but gold and silver have always been recognized for its value. A Bitcoin is brand new, about 2 or 3 years old I think.
@_date: 2013-02-12 19:26:13
Considering the USA is bankrupt for years and years and their fiat paper system is coming to an end, maybe theirs more of a chance we'll go back to more physical transactions.
Thank you for the link though, I will thoroughly read it.

Increasing in value by a ton doesn't have the aspect of being a store of value, more of a speculative product. in the 1920's a gold ounce would buy you a nice suit, today a gold ounce can still buy you a nice suit, this is a store of value.
Credible source? 4000+ years of being the choice of money is proof in and of itself. Remember that you are talking of money, not currency. Currency doesn't have to be a store of value.
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:14:29
Its completely relevant, the only thing you can do with bitcoin, is give it to someone else. Gold was a Commodity before it was money, Valued around the world.

Thank you for I didn't quite think of it like that. But I still have some issues on the value, I understand that value is only from what the people perceive it to be, but think about the effort it takes to mine gold and silver, years of work. 
Theirs a lot of things for it which is why its historically held its value over century's. Unlike Bitcoins were some of them were just released into existence, while theirs a pre set amount to be released in the future, which I suppose also comes out of thin air. For these reasons I find its value quite uncertain and honestly not much if any. Food for example takes time to grow and harvest, also many factors like no rain could effect the harvest and make it more valuable. I just don't find any of these in Bitcoins. 
I do understand that it's way easier to transfer money, and the transaction costs are less. Also just because its recovering its price doesn't always mean its a good thing, think about the Dow Jones for a second. Its back at $14,000 which it was at back before the crisis, but when you think about why it's back at this price (inflated currency) then it makes more sense. Sometimes its just an illusion. 
But I definitely agree that people that do put their money in Bitcoin shouldn't put more than 5%. I just truly find it really risk and more of an investment.

Big difference from mining silver and gold and "mining" bitcoins. Most computer chips and most ton of technology is gold plated. One big difference is that it physically exists and people can see and feel it. Poor guy... Do you think $200 million is a lot of money? The federal reserve prints $85 billion per month... You're the fucktard :( Haha then get out of my post. Cya bro

The dollar price of gold is volatile, it would be less volatile if it wasn't for the manipulation that goes on, Just a few weeks ago someone short sold 5000 gold lots at the market, all in one second... which is worth around $640 million. I'll admit the dollar is volatile, and it has big implementations on the Dollar price of gold, but over 4000 years gold has retained it value, and it will continue to do so, its has a pretty big historical trend. History shows it is not volatile, except short term, like the gold rushes. 
You are right, if it truly is worth that, then it would have to rise in value to get there.
The moment governments start hoarding it, that will be the moment when I am proved wrong. But right now it's to early to tell, they still haven't announced any buying, and it's still a tiny market share. China imported record amounts of gold this year, just a week and a half ago announced it would not buy anymore US bonds. Russia is also buying huge amounts of gold, and said they find "paper products risky" so the way I see it they are preparing to transact/accept gold. I still have no evidence of this in Bitcoin, but It could change. Me as an investor and trader, would need confirmation of this to buy bitcoin, not because I like bitcoin or see that it has value, but because governments might accept it for payment of taxes.
@_date: 2013-02-12 22:14:55
I have read enough about Bitcoins and researched it, never did I say I have nothing to learn from the world. Learn how to read English.
@_date: 2013-12-03 02:50:39
Well It has to be a store of value for it to be money, which bitcoin isn't. Gold has 4000+ years of being a store of value. Bitcoin has absolutely no years as being a store of value, but it does have 4 years of existence. So Gold wins, and is money.
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:21:46
Retired back to being a commodity? Are you stupid? Central banks hoard Gold as currency. To bad bitcoin isn't going to be, and gold has the support of Central banks not just "gold bugs"
@_date: 2013-11-28 06:05:59
If they demand gold for payment of taxes, bitcoin won't matter. If they decide to accept bitcoin for taxes then it will essentially have to be adopted.

You are either stupid or just don't know history. But let me educate you on the "crime of 73" when government demonetized silver, and started the gold standard. Silver was the most popular at the time... but they did it anyways. So this will never make me "assured" governments will accept it.
@_date: 2013-02-12 20:58:07
Yeah but thats "IF" they used it. Unfortunately they didn't... same thing could be said if they put that money into silver, but they didn't.

Na bro I live in the reality and not an illusion :)
@_date: 2013-02-13 00:49:07
Yes you're right about that, but at least it took effort to get it, which brings it its value and is an incentive for people to accept it. Scientific evidence has also shown that silver production has already peaked. But no one truly knows.
@_date: 2013-02-12 19:34:09
You said "idiot" also. Sorry if I offended you.
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:28:50
LOL bitcoin is more like money than gold? This is the biggest joke. Portability doesn't matter if it's not a store of value, nor does acceptability. Gold has been a store of value for $4000 years! :)

@_date: 2013-02-12 21:54:10
Same as silver, A ton of the silver mined goes straight to technology and produces the computers/phones you have to write these comments. Many of the silver isn't even recycled but thrown into the garbage. When silver increases in value people will stop throwing it away. A good example is Gold, barely anyone throws away gold. The computers you use have parts made of silver, Bitcoins don't make anything.
@_date: 2013-02-12 21:56:49
I enjoy having my silver :)
@_date: 2013-02-13 07:11:40
Their pegged to the dollar because almost any service/product you get from Bitcoins will be valued in fiat paper currency. Not necessary, thing that are pegged try to follow the ratio, it doesn't mean it will at all times.
Movie tickets have gone from costing around $0.50 80 years ago to its current price. Housing??? Housing has risen crazy in price. The reason Gold went up is because they don't wan't to be holding paper money and want a physical tangible commodity. Yes but a lot of my mindset is that dollars would rather chase silver and gold than Bitcoins, which is why I predict its value not rising enough to cover the price of inflation.
@_date: 2013-02-12 19:52:09
I never said the internet will seize to exist. Many places in Africa for example don't have access to electricity and the internet, considering the USA is Bankrupt and a million times poorer than Africa (because of Debt), electricity and the internet might be extremely expensive. And if that happens then the transaction costs will definitely go up and it might even be more expensive to transact in Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-02-12 21:40:09
Well I'll wait until the day more money goes into Bitcoins than other commodities. But until now more people have been buying silver and gold, the Royal Canadian Mint is now even putting restrictions on how much bullion you can buy of their Candian Maple leafs, which is already showing huge demand for silver. I understand you're point of the ease of sending Bitcoins. But also you can send Silver and Gold certificates. Which would take away a lot of the shipping fees.

You think you're smarter than all the billion $+ investors that are avoiding it? In fact, most of the world that's avoiding it? People have read up on it thoroughly, it doesn't change their opinions... It's a 11 billion dollar market place, even Twitter is double that LOL.

@_date: 2013-11-29 00:14:36
That's good you acknowledge it is high risk, because many people say its not, that its a "sure thing","will be the future", "Its going to $1,000,000+"
Hmmm you obviously stupid enough to not think the dollar is volatile considering the US started printing money like crazy, which is why investors took gold sky high compared the USD the last few years, and with fears of deflation and tapering that they are selling gold (Fed is not going to taper, and theirs no deflation) Investors got it wrong. If you can't even agree on that then I'm talking to a retard. 
Bitcoin doesn't follow any fundamental news, no matter what happens good or bad, people are just jumping on the bandwagon, so yes it is a pyramid scheme :)
Yes well many people claim its a store of value, which is completely idiotic considering theirs absolutely no proof of that. Being a store of value means it retains its value, not flying to the sky, or crashing down. People buy gold because its a safe store of value, not because of dreams of it going to a $100000 an ounce.
Not "when", IF millions of people participate .Their is no proof whatsoever this is happening, especially with a $11 billion market share... As I'll say again, even twitter is double that market share...
