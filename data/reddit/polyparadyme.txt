Care to elaborate?

True today, maybe not true tomorrow.

Duh. But if the only thing attached to your account is a email you use for sites like this and a bitcoin payment that's a lot better than all of your personal data.

Agora is probably the most professional of all the Darknet Markets. They seem to truly value client security and their own security over keeping the money flowing. Their integrity is so strong and I'm fairly certain they will be back soon.
I think they like being the best and I think they would like to keep it that way.

If users had bit coin that's one layer of privacy. But if they give out identifying information and emails in their accounts....then yeah they would be fucked.
But coin combined with secure messaging and throwaway email addresses and a lot of pain would have been avoided.

Sounds like you're the one sold on your beliefs. Not me.
Thanks for the chat.

For non-violent offenses?
Also, that's not how appeals work.

I had the same thought when she said it.

"it's too expensive to convict you of murder."  you is not an ideal legal argument. 
In regards to throwing out possibilities, that's what reasonable doubt is. If there's even a reasonable possibility that someone didn't commit a crime they aren't supposed to be convicted. We also don't know how much access these corrupt agents had or if the journal was a shared document among multiple DPR's. Digital evidence is easily tampered with and we don't know what the corrupt agents did/could have done to Ross's computer. 
I am very open-minded to believe that Ross was involved with the murders. If there was significant evidence pointing it in that direction I would explore that further. But to date, there isn't much to go off of other than what we've been told. 
If he's guilty of murder then they need to try him for it and you should consider abstaining your opinion until the murder trial happens, if it ever happens. 
The trial stunk to high hell of corruption and shady justice. Ross definitely broke the law, but he does not strike me as a murderer. He built his website on the premise of reducing violence through economic means and initiating a murder would stand against what he stood for. There's too many unknowns and possibilities with the evidence we currently have on hand.
I ask you to empathize and consider twelve angry men.
"It's always difficult to keep personal prejudice out of a thing like this. And wherever you run into it, prejudice always obscures the truth. I don't really know what the truth is. I don't suppose anybody will ever really know. Nine of us now seem to feel that the defendant is innocent, but we're just gambling on probabilities - we may be wrong. We may be trying to let a guilty man go free, I don't know. Nobody really can. But we have a reasonable doubt, and that's something that's very valuable in our system. No jury can declare a man guilty unless it's sure."

No she has an actual condition known as Broken Heart syndrome. It's linked in the article.

In regards to MD, why haven't they brought it to trial? 
A digital journal that may have been edited, or corrupted otherwise. Especially if the journal was a shared document. 
I think Ross wrote down a lot of foolish silly stuff, but I have a hard time today thinking he wrote down "lol murder for hire"
I do not trust the government to represent truth in this trial.

Lyn: They never formally charged Ross for this, and of course he’s not convicted for it. It seems wrong to sentence someone for an allegation that was never proven beyond a reasonable doubt in a courtroom, yet this issue strongly drove the sentencing. 
To boot, if the agents had access to the DPR account that further casts doubt on the situation. No?

Someone would need to get in touch with the Red Cross or other trusted organization and pass the funds to them. 
I'm happy to do it if the community trusts me enough to do it. 
I just want to pass funds or provide a direct route for the victims.

I did a review on it recently. Would recommend to others.
