Hoping to jump on this train...
Edit: Even if you don't tip me, thanks for helping to spread Bitcoin!

I'm a bit older than you, and I've been investing in the stocks for about a decade. In that time, I've made a fair amount of money, which I'll be using for a down payment on a house soon. Here's the thing. I caught wind of Apple and its potential early on before they became this supercorporation they are now. And one thing I always go back to thinking about is that if I had spent the $2000 that I used to buy my first PowerBook G3, and instead used it to buy Apple stock, I would now have enough to buy a frickin nice house, in cash.
The thing is, it's easy to get caught up on all the "What ifs" and not focus on all the good things that have come of the investments you've made. You've made some money, which is great! At least you didn't lose it all and go into debt trying to make up for it, like so many gamblers or penny stock traders do! One important thing to remember is to make all your investments with long-term growth as the goal. Look at the company, or in this case Bitcoin, and read as much as you can about it, and then decide if you think in the long run, not 1 month or 1 year from now, but like 5-10 years from now, if you think this will still be a big thing. That's how Warren Buffet built his fortune, and it's just sound investing advice.

Most metals you would find would be likely to melt in an intense fire. Other materials are more fireproof, but are impractical - like chiseling the key into a stone tablet like Moses. For accessing your own wallets, you should be using a long passphrase that you've memorized. But if this is for the purpose of, say, leaving your assets to your surviving loved ones after you perish in an arson fire, you might want to consider a paper wallet and a high-quality firesafe.

Sweet! Thanks!

It's true that I'll be quite tempted to buy more if it keeps dropping.

I currently play on SealsWithClubs. I think they're OK, but there is room for improvement. I have several suggestions/questions:
1) SealsWithClubs has suffered from several DDOS attacks. What are you going to do to protect against downtime from these kinds of attacks?
2) How will you ensure that player's funds are kept secure?
3) What poker software are you using? SealsWithClubs uses PokerMavens from Briggs Softworks. Apparently it's possible to verify the fairness of this software, but I haven't bothered to do so yet. But I am concerned about how easy it seems to hack it.
4) Someone else asked about protecting players against collusion. I see on your website you offer several solutions to things like table blocking or sitting out when a weak player is sitting out. That's nice, but do you have any protection against player bots or other forms of cheating?
5) Other poker sites have had problems with employees cheating by logging on as admin accounts and taking advantage of players. How many employees do you have and are you taking steps towards protecting players against this kind of fraud?
I'm sorry to beat you with so many questions, and of course I understand if you don't answer all of them. I've played a lot of internet poker, on several websites, and I just have a lot of concerns in general for Bitcoin poker. I want to see this happen! I really want this to be successful! And I would love to help test your software! In fact, I'm registering right now. Please don't take this as any kind of negative feedback. Good luck!

Any easy way to buy right now? Coinbase is down, BTC-E is takes too long for payment processing.
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:07:59
I just tried and I was given a notice that it would take 2 days before the money would arrive in my bank account. I was given this notice before confirming my sale, so they do give you fair warning.
Also, I have transferred btc from Blockchain to Coinbase and sold it in the past with no problems. This notice seems to be the result of high traffic volume.

I guess I just don't see the purpose of this post. Just to say "I told you so?" Unless... fear mongering to drive prices *even lower* with intentions of buying more. Hmmm, on second thought... **EVERYBODY PANIC! SELL YO SHIT QUICK GET THE FUCK UP OUT THIS BITCOIN!**

Listen to he's one of the few that speaks with reason. I'm getting pretty tired of the circle jerk that's happening today. Exponential growth like we've seen recently can't be maintained, and it's impossible to predict when the bubble will burst (yes, that's what it is you kooks). You're better off waiting for the correction.

What is causing this sudden recent price drop?

So, hypothetically speaking, if I were a Mt.Gox employee, what would be my preferred exchange?
@_date: 2013-03-20 20:08:59
Makes sense. But I can't wrap my head around how you would define economic growth if you have a global economy. Economic growth relative to what exactly? Maybe deflation would be more related to the global population.

I came.

No, reread my previous comments. I sold today, and was notified that there would be a two-day delay.

Thanks for answering my questions and for playing a few hands with me! It's awesome when a developer seeks direct input and feedback from the customers. I look forward to watching your progress.

I have not tried to buy during the recent run-up. In the past, I have been able to purchase btc instantly and transfer them immediately to another address. My guess would be that there are currently delays for everyone due Coinbase not having a large enough reserve of bitcoins to cover how many are being purchased.
