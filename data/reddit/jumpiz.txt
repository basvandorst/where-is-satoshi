That's a great phrase. I have ESL and never heard of it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:05:05
Totally agree.
It's really crazy, only holding BTC in my portfolio to balance my XLM dip at the moment (you can't compare techs and uses for it). 
I am tempted to sell my BTC at ATH (who knows where is the stop-limit) and buy more XLM with it.
Bought my BTC when it was $1200 so I don't mind if it goes back to $10k. But it will be a good opportunity to invest it in other coins when they are at the dip.

Paying with LTC would have been better.
Bitcoin is not made for payments or micro-transactions.
Switch to Stellar Lumens for the fastest experience and cheapest fees.
Confirmation in 5 [seconds] with a transaction fee of +/- $0.0000025 as of now.
Ripple is also good for this.
I know there is other coins with free transactions but I can only suggest what I've used personally for now.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:48:54
Check Stellar too.

Blockfolio on Android is very good. You can also check your portfolio profits and balance.

Holy fuck, Is it $700 now???

Cheaper than a Starbucks Frappuccino... If you want to call that coffee.

I have my BTC in a Ledger Nano S. I split it last week using [this video](
I was gonna dump it last week but I am glad I didn't. Today I woke up to $750 per coin...
Send my coins to Poloniex BCH deposit address to prepare for selling. That took quite a while for the funds to become available.
Waited a little more until it was over $800 and sold it at $810 around 3 hs ago. Thanks Korea!

I know, the split was so easy to do. I had to watch a 5 min How To video and it was done.
I am seriously impressed with this wallet. Best investment ever.
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:45:51
If it doesn't hold too well I might buy XRP with it for a long HODL.
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:28:14
That's what I've read, thank god I got a Ledger Nano S.
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:19:31
I've already made the split and I was gonna sell my BCH last week.
Thank god I didn't. I'll wait to see what happens.
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:15:04
I must have to check that one out, my renewal is up this month.
EDIT: It's $59.99 now or you may have a special price.

Private Internet Access is $40 a year and you can have it for 5 devices.
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:11:27
Sounds good, thanks!

Like they wanted to reconstruct Puerto Rico with my taxes by giving the contract to two middle men fronting as a company to get the 300 million contract?
Sorry, just playing devil's advocate...
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:09:45
Yep, I've used to use Poloniex mostly for Ripple, Vertcoin and Stellar but I got a problem with a bitcoin transaction never showing up and they took 2 months to reply and solved it.
Then after reading all the comments with the support issues (mine was only $ 0.15) it allowed me to nope out of there and going to Bitstamp, Changelly and Shapeshift.
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:09:57
Splitted my BTC/BCH with my Ledger Nano S and sold my BCH when it was $830. Exchange it for XRP at $0.17 and some cash back to my checkings. Now XRP is $0.25 and going up I guess.
Awesome deal!
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:21:03
I remember trying to decide if I wanted to buy at $250, then, next time I've checked it was $600, then $900...
Finally bought at $1200.
Still HODLing... It's been quite a ride and it's not even a year I've started with crypto.
Just buy it on the next dip or you will never start. Easiest is Coinbase, read about GDAX if you want to bypass some Coinbase fees.

This is a great show. Money Heist in Netflix. Originally "La Casa De Papel" from Antena 3 (Spain TV).  
Watching the 2nd season right now.
@_date: 2017-07-23 18:47:47
That was me with Ethereum, bought it at $87, sold it at $320.
Same with LTC, bought at $29...

I know it's a big relief paying that, but you should have kept paying your loans on your normal schedule by withdrawing only the minimum coins you needed per month. That way at the end you will have more coins which will be incremented in value with time instead of less coins like right now. The interest you will be losing this way will be nothing compared to the gains of the coins.

I think CoinBase (and GDAX) said it will not support BCC.
So I might end up selling them on whatever exchange supports the coin.
Coins are safely kept in my Ledger Nano S for now...
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:17:37
I don't think it will go down to the $1800s like the last time.
I had my money ready on GDAX for this dip. I've pulled the trigger today at $2500. Now to HODL.
At least it's not $2900. It could go down a little more but I prefer not to play roulette with it.
Then after August 1st I'll sell my extra BCC for free money.
@_date: 2017-07-23 18:40:37
Same waiting for my CoinBase bank transfer. Fuck...
Now that I got the money there I will be waiting for another dip before August 1st. If not I'll buy at $3000 before it goes to the moon.

First, you need the main account password to access after getting the SMS anyway for the encryption of your keys, if you don't have the passphrase you can't access your account.
Let's just say for a moment that you disable the multi-device feature. Now if you have a home invasion and they steal your laptop and your phone you have no way of recover the account and you're pretty much fucked.

They should do a menu in a 50" TV with a Raspberry Pi calculating the price connected to the internet, so no edits.
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:37:52
Good to know... I will check most of it then.
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:48:24
Sorry to hear that, sucks.
That's why I've always check the first and last few characters on the address to match every time I paste it anywhere.
Only use Chrome for everything related to crypto, and Firefox for my normal browsing.
And I bought a year of Kaspersky Total Security on Amazon for $25, for 3 devices.
There is always a posibility of infection, but I've tried to minimize it the best I can.
