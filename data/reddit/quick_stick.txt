Better idea. Why not just wait till 0 and pay no tax at all.

What a fucking retard. Because loosing $30 is the same as losing $16k. Plus you know fucking howling they are still comparing it to the precious fiat. If that doesn’t scream Ponzi then I don’t know what does.

Plot twist. No one accepts Bitcoin it’s just a medium of transfer to proper currency lol. 
@_date: 2018-10-06 07:30:28
Yep n
@_date: 2018-10-28 08:09:56
Because everyone’s lost interest in this fad. Also you do realise you just want it for gain lol gamblers ����£££££
@_date: 2018-10-06 08:37:03
That must make you a Trust fund kid then. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 11:36:44
That’s a lot of $$$ ... think about that ����
@_date: 2019-02-10 17:05:05
OK, Answer me this. Why did he just not use a Currency Exchange like every other normal person. He was trying to hide his money. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 16:11:14
I can understand why you might be confused. The guy in the article not the main dude. The guy in the article was trying to move money between banks using crypto. If I was the authorities I’d be charging him with money laundering. 
@_date: 2019-02-12 20:10:32
Moneyyyyyy Launderrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrringgggggggggggggggg WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Nailed it. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 22:45:18
Lol. Money laundering 
@_date: 2019-02-11 15:01:43
Lol. Yeah I can read alright. Still the guy should be arrested. Definitely suspicious 
@_date: 2019-02-12 19:51:42
Laundering fucking money!! Right there in the article. BOOM!! Called it. 
@_date: 2019-02-11 13:03:37
Saving on tax more like. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 22:06:52
Lol. Just seems a bit suspect to me. How he’s trying to avoid transferring currency the legitimate way for something that is known to have exorbitant fees. Sounds like a classic money laundering scheme to me. 
@_date: 2019-02-11 17:42:43
OK, lets put it this way. The ONLY people who use Crypto are... Criminals, Fraudsters (Criminals) and oh yeah... Criminals. No sane average person uses it because they have no need to a normal perfectly good working system is already in place for them. 
@_date: 2019-02-23 17:32:08
I don't care what you say, It's a hack. It even says so in the article. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 22:17:57
Lol no one will ever know now. The blockchain fees are sky high. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 21:39:45
Why did he not just convert US ——&gt; CAD like a normal person rather than launder through this scam site. 
@_date: 2019-02-16 21:48:23
No ones heard of it, it’s called a shitcoin for a reason haha. 
@_date: 2019-02-12 19:41:33
Laundering fucking money!! Right there in the article. BOOM!! Called it. 
@_date: 2019-02-15 02:37:07
Lol. Money laundering. It even says so in the article. 
@_date: 2019-02-23 17:48:30
Attack, Flawed technology, Poorly designed. Whatever you want to call it. 
@_date: 2019-02-23 18:02:59
LOL! Found him over here guys, Long  ROFL!! 
@_date: 2019-02-12 07:14:40
It’s terrible that this guy is a blatant criminal and not been arrested for it. Sad sad world. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:32:32
Everyone wants to be fucking rich and bitcoin is the way to do this quickly, or that’s how it appeared to be. That easy. Not so much....
@_date: 2018-07-23 23:03:42
They are not idiots. They are 100% correct. You can Infact buy things with a gold backed currency standard. If you go into Walmart they have to accept gold, company policy (Source: Walmart Employee) 
@_date: 2018-07-28 08:57:35
Yes but people want money NOW! That’s the difference. They are junkies on it. Lovely lovely dollars and pounds. Fuck Bitcoin and it’s intended purpose. Gainz bro. I’ve never “invested” in my life but I got a sure thing going 1000% return a month. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 08:44:40
No. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 18:49:45
The ATH was 16k. No one ever completed a transaction at 19k. It was only a rumour 19k
@_date: 2018-12-25 19:12:46
True.
