I would consult a tax professional. My own opinion would be any US dollars above what you put in would be considered capital gains - regardless of your bitcoin amount. For example if you bought 1 bitcoin for $100 5 years ago and now only have .5 bitcoin from day trading but it's worth $5xxx then you'd still have capital gains even though you have lost bitcoin. Because you gained US dollars. The capital gains would be due when you cash it out back into USD. 
However this is just my opinion and again, I am not a tax professional. So I'd recommend talking to someone who knows what they are talking about ;)

Came here to say this. I think people forget why futures were created in the first place. As a means to hedge risk, not speculate. Not saying speculation doesn't happen but that's the only aspect anyone is talking about this week.

Then no luck is needed to be wished. If you reported everything and paid your taxes, you're fine.

Thank you for the thoughtful post - good stuff here. 
The business idea itself is quite simple - I want to manage people's money. Think of me as a financial adivsor in the bitcoin community. 
In the past I actively day traded bitcoin and other alt coins and did quite well with it. So starting a business where I take investors money and actively day trade it for the goal of capital appreciation is really the entire business. I'm not trying to run a ponzi scheme with guaranteed results but rather try my luck at day trading in hopes of ending up with more money than we started with. Everyone involved is clearly aware of the risks that we can lose everything at any given point. 
It would be like saying "if I was a pro poker player and I had 10 friends who each wanted to give me $100,000 to take with me to vegas. What regulation would I have to setup in order to make that happen?"
Lets say I have 10 friends here in my home state that all want to give me $100,000 to take to the alt coin exchanges. That's the business in a nutshell and I'm trying to figure out what steps I need to take in order to make this happen. I can't assume people can just wire me $100k each - lets say I double everyone's money. Well now taxes are due - I'm wiring them all back $200k and then we figure out the taxes? This is all where I'm getting caught up and like I said I've been hearing different things as far as what I need to do. 
But again - appreciate the reply.

Hey, thanks for the answer. Appreciate you taking the time to write this up!

Well unfortunately going outside of the US isn't really an option. I live here, my family is all here - we're not going to uproot for a new startup idea. 
While I understand dealing with the regulation is horrible, I don't mind doing so. I'm simply trying to figure out what hoops I need to jump through and then I will do it. If it's on par with opening a hedge fund then I'll just aim to do that =)

I love it! I use Fidelity for my stock trading and this makes me appreciate them even more. A+ work!
**Edit:** just realized this is for coinbase only accounts =/ too bad since I have my coins in cold storage. Well it's still a step in the right direction. I'm still happy :)
@_date: 2017-08-08 05:09:34
It's funny how quickly you can tell if somebody does or doesn't own bitcoin. 
With that being said, this is one of the best reviews I've seen on bitcoin in awhile o.0
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:15:08
New ATH!!
@_date: 2017-08-09 19:17:51
Interest facts: I manage a crypto fund and met with some higher ups @ Fidelity a month or two ago to talk partnerships. They didn't get into a lot of specifics but did mention they already had trademarked a few different names including Fidelitycoin and Fidelitytoken in addition to having done a few more internal moves tied to cryptos. They are definitely ahead of the game. 
Also, don't forget back in 2013 for 1 day they allowed bitcoin to be added to client's IRAs :)

The transfer time is typically ~10 minutes for settlement. As of today the current fee structure is ~$0.20 (USD) to send any amount of money. You can sacrifice time for lower fees. For example if you wanted to send $0.10 to someone and only pay $0.05 to send it - you can setup that fee structure but it might take hours (or even a day) for it to arrive. But long story short - you can send any amount of money for under $1 and in about 10 minutes.

I have no idea. I think my only speculation was to tie up the name legally before someone else takes it and asks to sell it back. The same way people scoop up URLs before they are in use just to lock in the name. That would be my speculation... nothing sexy ;)
@_date: 2018-10-31 04:23:44
Kind of a stupid quote IMO. One of the main services banks offer is lending money; credit cards, mortgages, business lines of credit. Bitcoin has literally nothing to do with any of that. In addition to that lets talk about storing money. I've been in crypto for 5-6 years now and if there is 1 thing I've learned it's that most people shouldn't be their own banks. Lost private keys, lost passwords, lost trezors... 9 out of 10 people are better off keeping their money at a bank. 
The only thing I can relate to this quote is the aspect of money transfer. I absolutely think BTC does a better job than banks or western union when it comes to sending money from party A to party B -- mainly due to speed and lower fees. But how often is the average person going to a bank to do wire transfers in the first place? 
And as so many people have pointed out - the post office is still around today.  Email doesn't really help me get my inventory to my customers.

Welcome to the other side. Funny, I didn't hate banks when I first got into crypto currencies back in 2013. Fast forward to today and I absolutely can't stand them. 
I'm on my 3rd bank this year and it's only a matter of time before they close down my account too.

That was a fun story to read, thank you for sharing it. 
On a some-what related note, I'm glad you also confirmed for me that I was probably better off just buying bitcoin vs. mining. It's something I've always questioned but left it at "I'm probably just better off buying bitcoin at $xx vs. investing that much into mining equipment". =)
Nice job on making $3k at age 14. That's awesome!!
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:45:17
Comparing the value of an investment you hold and a sports bet is a terrible analogy. I too once believed "you only take a loss if you sell" but then realized that's not how investing works. I'd encourage you to change your mindset in this regard. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:11:55
Just remember, the war hasn't started yet. If bitcoin is going to truly survive, big banks and governments won't just rollover. Basically what I'm saying is if you think BCH is bad, you ain't seen shit yet.

The "most people on the planet will never be able to own one full bitcoin" happened back around $2,000. We're getting close to the "most people on the planet will never be able to own .1 BTC" territory ;)

Good call man! I've had my life savings in BTC going back to ~2013. It wasn't much at the time but now it's a sizable amount of value. 
Another friend of mine recently went all-in on bitcoin about 2-3 weeks ago @ $6,500 and others were calling him crazy too. I told him it was a good move (he understood the risk). 
Good luck!

Interesting idea - anything that involves games + bitcoin is cool to me
@_date: 2016-02-02 06:32:24
I'm sorry - I'm completely open to listening to advice. That's part of the reason I'm here. 
I don't mean for you to repeat yourself but I don't understand what you mean when you say I should make a proof of concept. I understand what a proof of concept is and have done it with other startups but I don't understand how you could create a proof of concept managing people's money? I'm all ears on ideas. 
And I also took your advice by already reaching out to Bitcoin Plug and Play that you had referred earlier. I assure you I'm listening to the advice being shared here. 
Edit: The only thing I could see being done for a proof of concept with this type of fund would be to outline the investment strategy and the target market of who'd I'd be going after but that doesn't to me seem to be the right information.  
@_date: 2016-02-02 06:38:59
Well I do greatly appreciate you taking the time to provide the feedback you have. I assure you that I'll take it all in. Thanks for your time.

Hey, 
Again, appreciate the message and for taking the time to do a little digging - really that's awesome. I'm not sure though if we are on the same page because really I don't see github being a need for the business I am wanting to start. 
If you've read through some of my previous posts then you'll see I talk a lot of web/seo because that's the world I currently live in. However previous to that I was working in finance which is where the 'bitcoin investment fund' idea is coming from. It's been about 3 years since I left my job in finance and pretty much not a day goes by where I don't miss it. However my other passion is in bitcoin and so creating something like a bitcoin investment fund would be a perfect alignment of my passions. 
Fast forward to the idea - I'm just trying to start what would probably be best described as a small hedge fund. I don't really feel as though there is a need to create some prototype proof of concept. My proof of concept is that I've been talking to people about bitcoin since 2012, help dozen of people invest in bitcoin and continue to be a source of information for people who want information about bitcoin within my community. I know there is an interest in the market. I've been living it for 4 years. 
What I was trying to get an answer to (which I think I've found) is whether or not I could create this type of business w/o having to register as an investment company. What I believe to be true is based on the way I was looking to structure the business is that it would be best defined as a private investment company thus not have a need for regulation. However once I surpass 15 clients I myself would need to be a registered investment advisor - which is easy to do. 
So if I can get this up and running there really won't be a need for any website/software/program - it would just be simple trading being done by myself. I'm pretty sure based on the minimal amount of client's I'd be looking to engage and a minimum amount of capital - I'd probably fly under the radar anyway. Nevertheless I want to make sure I'm compliant and doing things properly so it doesn't come back to bite me in the ass =)
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:06:12
Yeah I would agree I'm in the 0.0001% here. Most people do not use bitcoin for daily activities. 
I'm not 100% there yet but I do believe at some point in 2018 I will be 100% bankless... I should have no  accounts/credit cards/mortgages/etc with any banks by the end of the year :)
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:14:59

Get used to it. I've been telling people to buy bitcoin since it was around $30/coin. I do a lot of public speaking/events... probably talked to thousands of people over the last 5 years about it. Out of the thousands I've spoken to, I know 5 people who took my advice and bought. Out of those 5 only 3 are still hodling.

@_date: 2016-07-23 07:11:50
That sucks man... 
I would put a large amount of the blame on the food truck guy. If they are going to advertise that they accept bitcoin - they need to be educated on the ins &amp; outs of it all. Can't just sort of know what's going on. 
I'd also point out this isn't a "bitcoin only" problem. I've had credit cards charged twice multiple times in my life. Not x4 but definitely twice. 
I would disagree with TogoTogo in regards to using iphone products &amp; bitcoin. Granted I hate apple as a company and own nothing with an 'i' in front of it, apple users should still be able to seamlessly enjoy using bitcoin too. 
I hope this doesn't discourage you from trying again in the future. It's all unfortunately part of the society learning curve of a new, complicated technology.
