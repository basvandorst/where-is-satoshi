I have looked at this a little deeper. The jury ruled out the sole custody claimed by her. All three judges make the children to be taken from her, until she went for a substance treatment, or how the fact it is called, she admitted she has a problem of substance abuse. Watch this: 
As of now, after her rehab session, they both share the time with their children.

Of course not. But I would like to know what would happen in such case. I think this is only a war scenario, but still.

But Russians are testing it this or next month. Do you think the Russian engineers don't know what they are doing? Again, if you have a sattelite Internet or you live in a border area where there is signal from some other mobile internet provider, of course, you can connect anywhere. But when you are using the Internet provider inside Russia, I think you wouldn't be allowed to use even VPNs, because those IPs will be blocked.

I think a lot of Americans have a problem to grasp how easy it is to send money from one account to another within the EU. If I am proud of something as a EU citizen, it's our banking system.
The easy to use an reliable EU banking system is the reason why Bitcoin, after reaching more than 10 GB started to be a pain to use on older computers. Now it has 200GB+ and you basically have to use some 3rd party service to use Bitcoin, at which point it doesn't matter if I use theat service or bank.
And the bank gives you at least some protection and piece of mind. 
Unless there is something revolutionary (and I don't mean and I hope not like in Venezuela) Europeans won't start using Bitcoin instead of Euros. Because, honestly, the European banking system is awesome and it's getting better each year.

Really? I don't watch him now - he is not on Youtube, only if I go directly to infowars.com like once a month or less. Did he really lost it? I have tried googled it via "alex jones kids" but all I can find is the Sandy hook kids incident, nothing about the lost custody. 
Can you post a link to the news about his lost custody?
