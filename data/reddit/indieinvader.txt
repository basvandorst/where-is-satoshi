I sell on LocalBitcoins and its been a great experience for me so far, my customers have given me good feedback as well. I only wish I could afford larger trade volumes!
If you're in my area, I'm _xj9; I'd be happy to sell you some coins!

Take a look at [this]( it'll help you calculate your profitability.

GPUs are a lot more expensive. These ASIC miners cost about $40/GH while a GPU miner costs around $500/GH. (Based on the approximate hashrate of a Radeon HD 7970 hosting $300/ea.)

Excluding yourself from the system doesn't solve anything. If you want to bring about societal change you have to function as a part of the system to be taken seriously, you don't have to believe in it but you do have to participate if you want to get anything done.

It's significantly easier to do a 51% attack on the Tor network than it is on the Bitcoin network.
On Tor you only need to control more than half of the relays and you can intercept pretty much any traffic. 
On the Bitcoin network you have to control 51% of the total computing power on the network; a much, much more expensive proposition.

I haven't been able to verify, but it seems to be working for other people.

The guy that makes these coins goes to the same bitcoin meetup group that I go to, I can't afford them but I have seen them in person. Those coins are amazing!

I'm working on a project to address this issue, hopefully on a larger scale than my town, though.

Don't let your paranoid monkey-brain rule your life! Sure, infringing on privacy is bad but you don't need to get all fight-or-flight about it. Use Facebook like intended (to keep in touch with friends and family) and keep your secret shit secret.

Is facilitating money transmission a crime now?

The medium is suited more for archival storage than anything else. Storage capacity is going to increase, there is no question about it, but I doubt this technology in particular is going to be the one to do so (replace magnetic hard drives and ssds).
@_date: 2013-07-21 13:07:01
I'm looking into doing something similar here in the US.

Bitmessage needs a lot of work before I can consider it more than a novelty. It has some sound ideas but the implementation in unproven and nobody on the development team is a qualified cryptographer.
@_date: 2013-07-13 17:45:03
How does an archival storage format solve the blockchain storage problem?

The BitTorrent protocol is still a great piece of technology, the problem is the lack of distributed-ness when it comes to finding torrents; you can shutdown trackers and websites like the PirateBay but you can't shutdown the BitTorrent network.
Whatever comes next doesn't need to develop a new distribution method, they just need to figure out how to share metadata anonymously and effectively. (If we're talking about file-sharing)
@_date: 2013-07-22 07:15:29
That would result in an automatic loss! Trading paper wallets, on the other hand actually makes sense.
@_date: 2013-07-21 03:09:52
I just got one of those!

In a democracy you kind of give your consent to have such laws, monarchies not so much.
**Edit:** Wow, looks like reddit's libertarian brigade doesn't understand democracy.

Use better values then.

I think the trend is moving towards smartphones being a replacement for your wallet: Google and Square allow for debit-style payments, you can get into theaters and other events using only digital stubs, &amp;amp;c.
If I could ditch my wallet because my smartphone can take care of everything I need it for, I would.

No everyone thinks taxation is slavery, either. 
@_date: 2013-07-11 00:47:40
I can dig that.

Has Butterfly delivered anything? I was looking at buying a jalapeño but I want to know when, if ever, I would receive the device. Or how long new orders have been taking to fulfill if they are going out.

As a mexican, I approve of this.

I think it's good for spreading awareness but it isn't directly going to make the bitcoin economy any bigger.
@_date: 2013-07-01 08:41:55
That's unfortunate. Who actually is shipping?
@_date: 2013-08-03 08:29:21
I don't think there's any way for that to be sustainable.

Like I said, this won't solve the blockchain storage problem. From the article:


You could take snapshots of the blockchain and keep them forever, I guess, but that doesn't really solve anything.
is right, you don't know what you're talking about.

Yes, you delegate your choice to your representative with the understanding that by participating in the democracy (through your representative or whatever system your have in place) you accept the rule of the majority.

It's a little late to get into the mining game, my friend. (If you expect to be profitable, that is) You'd be much better off buying $1000 BTC (do it now, the exchange rate dropped recently and is growing again!), getting a return is almost certain.
@_date: 2013-07-21 14:31:12
It depends on how you figure the exchange rate. If you take the weighted average of multiple markets by volume or something similar you can get a better (and more stable) view of the actual exchange rate. 
Mt. Gox isn't the only exchange.
@_date: 2013-07-10 11:00:39
This would be more work than starting from scratch, I think.
@_date: 2013-06-01 20:42:31
Yes and "all" Microsoft would have to do to make windows open source is release the source code, but that doesn't mean it's going to happen.
@_date: 2013-07-22 07:56:20
Orthodoxy isn't helpful here. We need to foster cooperation if we want Bitcoin to go anywhere. People are inherently distrustful of anything new, getting over that takes time and patience.
@_date: 2013-07-21 13:55:28
Blockchain.info's app works just fine (you can send and receive payments, check your balance and view your tx history). I use it for LocalBitcoin sales.

This guy seems a little shady but I can vouch for Uruguay being a great place for Bitcoin! The people are generally well educated, ANTEL, the national telecommunications company, is deploying fiber optics across the county and they tend to have a good relationship with foreign investors and foreigners in general. Smartphones aren't quite as ubiquitous but they are gaining traction fairly rapidly.
Economically it has one of the highest GDPs per capita in South America and was voted the best country in the region (tied with Chile) a few years back.

Gotcha, I really don't want to invade anyone's privacy! I do think, however, that a non-evil analytics platform tied to cruptocurrencies for monetization is good for both content creators and consumers.
Help me not be evil?
@_date: 2013-07-21 11:35:37
Blockchain.info exposes the bitcoind rpc API, you could use that.

By participating in a democracy you consent to accept the rule of the majority.

Yes, geographic.
