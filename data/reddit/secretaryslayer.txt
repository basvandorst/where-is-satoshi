Ya it’s been great. Loved that 10,800 buy I just made earlier.

“...invests $2”
Ya I’m a bit of a crypto day trader myself.
If you can’t explain something to someone else, you don’t understand it. You can’t even explain to yourself what your currently doing.
Just buy and hold if you are trying to “invest”. But ya this is basically exactly what I expected to happen with Bitmex and margin calls.
@_date: 2019-07-27 23:43:07
Ya I would never leave/have money on that shit site. Keep us posted because I hear of stuff like this happening all the time where people are banned/shut out of accounts/can’t access funds etc
@_date: 2019-07-02 03:19:28
Step 1. Buy through the Coinbase app on your phone
Step 2. Open Coinbase Pro to have immediate access to those funds versus sending via bank transfer which takes 5 days
Transfers are 5-10 minutes for me...you can pay more to transfer quicker.
There are better exchanges for sure, ie: Kraken, but I was comparing CB to cash
@_date: 2019-07-13 00:28:15
Did your dad get the oil tho
@_date: 2019-07-27 21:30:01
Holy fucking cringe.
Well made though...
@_date: 2019-07-13 00:17:59
Probably because they are lame man. Sorry to be a dick but someone needs to tell you

Aww yesss the fomo is finally hitting trump. I wonder how much his “subsidiaries” hold regardless
@_date: 2019-07-14 22:00:59
This ain’t the right sub for these kinds of questions anymore. In fact the right sub doesn’t even exist anymore...
@_date: 2019-07-27 23:45:28
Almost any exchange out there. Coinbase, cashapp, kraken, etc
@_date: 2019-07-13 00:16:08
Coinbase &gt; ledger = $1.20-2.50
Cash app &gt; ledger = $6+ 
I made a $20 transfer from cash to ledger and was charged over $5 in fees.
Also, they held my funds for over 45 days while “verifying my identity” aka being passed around from rep to rep until I sent an email asking if they were intentionally holding funds on their exchange and 5 minutes later I was magically verified 
FUCK CASHAPP. Super convenient at the time, not in the long term.
@_date: 2019-07-11 23:53:04
If you want to pay $200-400 over market and deal with crazy withdrawal fees then cash app is great
@_date: 2019-07-27 23:56:54
So are you selling some as we speak to rebuy back in at 1k-1.5k less in the next 2-4 weeks? Please post pics
@_date: 2019-07-02 02:53:28
I had a terrible experience with them for a number of reasons
1. It took them literally over a month to verify my identity and enable withdrawals, 0 issue with coinbase 
2. You don’t “pay fees” but the price per BTC is $200-300 than coinbase 
3. Anytime I transfer from cash to ledger it takes $6+ in fees just to transfer to my wallet, coinbase is usually $1-2
@_date: 2019-07-12 01:08:02
That is beyond ignorant. You are saying you know more than a 61 year old who is a master of cryptography, global financial markets and currencies, and software engineering?

Please please fall back to 5k again haha

A bank or they sell crypto? 
If it was a bank that seems kind of counter intuitive doesn’t it?
@_date: 2019-07-17 02:57:22
Weekly down 28%, monthly up 1.9% currently...
@_date: 2019-07-14 22:01:53
Good. You should not be using credit to buy crypto in the first place, in 95% of cases
@_date: 2019-07-27 23:33:58
What does this have to do with BTC/crypto. Or is it just the usual “down with the banks/fiat” bullshit that constantly gets spewed.
Of course there are better places to park money/invest than leaving in a 2-3% yielding account. Is this now?
@_date: 2019-07-19 00:42:47
Thanks for posting. I’ve used ATMs to buy, but have never seen an actual withdrawal for cash. Really cool!
@_date: 2019-07-27 23:31:17
You might want to do a little more research on tether....
@_date: 2019-07-11 04:35:13
Try resynching or go into your settings and switch to a different exchange. One day I woke up and my ledger showed a $0 usd balance, then I switched it to display kraken and everything was as it should be.
It’s just an error with ledger and one certain exchange usually
@_date: 2019-07-17 02:55:22
This is complete shit
@_date: 2019-07-27 23:40:32
I can’t even tell who is joking anymore when they say “this is the last time BTC will be under 10k”.
@_date: 2019-07-13 00:24:18
If you don’t understand how no one has been able to identify “him” you don’t understand the complexity of the blockchain and the amount of effort that was put into this project. Keep in mind it was 2012 and he covered all of his tracks. Burner computer/tails/vpn/tor etc makes you pretty hard to track via IP
If it was done from an iPhone in 2019...different story
@_date: 2019-10-13 23:32:34
Ya bro but the graph....
@_date: 2019-08-14 09:07:46
Oooof and it’s at 10,400 at the moment...
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:40:22
I don’t get it...

I predict tomorrow it will either go way up or way down.

“Beta testing” 
“Algorithm and data”
Ok bro I’m sold. Take my money
@_date: 2019-06-04 04:54:02
Well the price did drop to 7.8k....
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:16:53
I completely miss “the old days” of this sub too. I’m with you 100%. Is this sub toxic for the most part, definitely.
That being said bitcoin is not what it was 5 years ago. It has become something way bigger than any of us pictured and obviously the finance industry took interest.
Widespread adoption is going to be awesome I’m with you there. But why would any rational human spend bitcoin on a transaction with how volatile the market is currently? Until there is some stabilization I’m transacting in USD and hodling
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:20:41
But adoption bruh...
@_date: 2019-06-20 05:00:25
Yeah I was just able to transfer over for no fees. Not sure what I tried to do last time...
@_date: 2019-06-20 00:26:31
Solid reference

Could be minutes, could be hours. It will probably feel like seconds either way with the amount of Xanax you claim to be on.
@_date: 2019-06-04 04:56:39
Good luck sir! I highly recommend Robinhood with options/margins/and box-spreads. You’re well on your way to financial freedom
@_date: 2019-06-20 23:56:03
Are you trying to submit it under the license or ID section? I have never had an issue getting verified with a state ID. Was verified instantly every time, both with just an ID and once with a license on different accounts.
Customer service wise...good luck

@_date: 2019-06-20 00:28:35
I just tried to transfer a small sum out of coinbase to pro the other day and it wanted a ~$4 fee to transfer like $30 usd worth of BTC. Maybe it was because it was a small amount? Seemed strange either way...
@_date: 2019-06-20 00:08:29
A Samsung takes a screenshot of the entire phone itself? You seriously held 8k in doge? This is the most bullshit picture I’ve ever seen.
@_date: 2019-06-27 04:08:36
Why not both? What’s wrong with selling and buying back in for less?
You’re honestly telling me that if you paid $500 USD for a good or service with BTC and it’s value changed to $1,000 USD the next week, you wouldn’t care? Why wouldn’t you pay USD when just today we had a +/-$2,000 fluctuation. 
How is that not being financially reckless at that point? I am with you 100%, but the current market is way to volatile for this to make sense for the majority of people.
@_date: 2019-06-14 23:42:54
Did you actually just say “no one uses BTC on the darknet”? I think you need to do some more research on the history of bitcoin. Good to see you posting solid links though for sure. Those are great resources. 
“It’s more anonymous to use dollar bills” 
Of course it is an open LEDGER. But i think leaving out the whole anonymity part is pretty misleading. 
I do not use BTC for any illicit purposes, but to just blatantly ignore how crictical the darknet was to bitcoins success and visa versa is just ignorant. Luckily it has found legitimacy, but BTC transactions and PGP encryption is literally one the only reasons the darknet markets were/are able to function.
@_date: 2019-06-20 00:23:29
“Been in the game”. Does that mean you knew what BTC was and looked at some forums, or you are holding bags from 2013?
Taking a wild guess it’s the first
@_date: 2019-06-22 05:26:03
Other markets are closed. Mix that with large amounts of cocaine, Xanax, alcohol and you get a lot of people who are figuratively on the moon thinking they will literally get there.
Sometimes the liquor makes the buy order, sometimes the cocaine
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:24:45
It goes down but then it goes up.
@_date: 2019-12-17 00:18:52
So you’ve just bought once and been holding ever since? This ain’t doge. While 1 BTC = 1 BTC, my buying power with those BTC just took a hit. 
I could have bought 1 BTC today for 6,850, but last month I would have spent 7.5-8k. So unless bitcoin becomes a standard currency, if I had just held my USD I would have about $1,000 more USD to buy BTC with today.
I get your point but it’s irrelevant until BTC becomes ubiquitous and is treated and used PRIMARILY as currency
@_date: 2019-12-17 00:24:24
I’ve had best results with doing DCA and the occasional “buying dips” which is always a gamble, but when you’re holding pocket aces sometimes you need to up the ante.
And I don’t mean anything crazy, just money I can afford to lose. For instance, I DCA twice per month but once we went under 7k I bought a bit outside of my DCA. This is an obvious gamble and I’m prepared for a drop down to 5k, or........THE MOON
@_date: 2019-12-17 00:25:42
Having had both I’m a ledger nano x guy. Works like a charm, sleeker form factor, holds my precious 10000000000000000 BTC (don’t hack me plz)

It’s all about perspective. That is some people’s monthly income
@_date: 2019-09-25 00:29:59
Ya I’ve noticed the same thing.
It’s no longer “hahaha bitcoin is crashing I told you that shit was stupid”
Now it’s “bro is this a dip!? Should I buy? Do you think it’s going to go back up?”
@_date: 2019-09-25 00:33:36
Or it sounds like someone who could have spent 11% less on a cup of coffee today with USD than they would have paid yesterday.....
@_date: 2019-09-25 00:31:03
What are you talking about? It’s an exchange....I buy off cashapp all the time then transfer to my ledger.
@_date: 2019-09-19 07:57:53
Buy buy buy. Literally crashed under 10k not even a few weeks ago and has been pushing 10.5k resistance even with the upswings and down swings
@_date: 2019-05-27 19:21:42
While you guys are crunching the numbers, can you figure out how old I am in dog years?

Scarcity usually = increased value. How would there being less and less coins available cause the price to go down to 0? 
Also, look at how “just printing more” has worked out for global economies, ie: Venezuela and Zimbabwe
@_date: 2019-05-28 19:46:33
And you also create “custom” fake shoes out of a factory in China according to your post history. If you can figure out how to knock off kicks, I bet you could google your question to find out how to take payment for your counterfeit wares.
