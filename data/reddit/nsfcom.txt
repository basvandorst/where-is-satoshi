It's like sending you phone number to your friend via email .
Even when you use different cell phone operator , anyone can call and text you .
The same concept with bitcoin , wallets are like cell operators and anyone have your wallet address can send you bitcoins just like sms .

This is a great question , bitcoin holds the value it self , we have a heigh rate of inflation this what makes bitcoin a good way to save money. 
Digital  good via the internet including books which not available for all .
Sending and receiving money from relatives out of Sudan .
Paying for online services like web hosting and so .

I have an account there 
I had one call from a seller , it was great ,, 
Then we got stuck on how we get more bitcoins .
@_date: 2015-05-16 18:29:37
I added a comment about it ,
Paypal is not available in Sudan due US sanctions . So we are looking for alternative method and exchange with companies that **do not comply with** US sanctions .  
@_date: 2015-05-16 21:23:32
This is great , I will try it now .
@_date: 2015-05-26 20:30:31
Sudan is not supported as usual ,,  Because of the US sanctions .  
@_date: 2015-05-17 18:29:45
Thanks :) for the Gumball 
@_date: 2015-05-16 18:06:42
True , this why we need already working system from another country to support exchange in wide scale .
@_date: 2015-05-16 17:10:02
Yes , it's true , in fact the remittance amount is growing each year since 2012 .
In order to transfer money to Sudan     Banks are not an option due high rates and the receivers will get Sudanese pounds with a higher rate .
Bitcoin is the best , safer , easiest way if you have it , getting bitcoin without banks or exchange companies is a headache .
The problem is those bitcoin exchange companies and banks do not deal with Sudanese banks.
**I asked around and found that some countries will a accept Sudanese transfer without any problem , like Romania , Russia , the Bahamas .
Any known companies based on those areas ? **

Update:

@_date: 2015-05-17 07:03:14
Then we put it to work on daily based once it's available to trade and exchange anytime .

I understand this well , but how to make Bitcoin better and more stable in real life value ,, 
I believe that bitcoin is born to be the main currency and to take value from constant things not fake currencies we use today ..
All those currencies are controlled by bankers and now we only use bitcoin to transfer bank's money not to hold a value .
@_date: 2015-04-04 12:18:06
how we can get bitcoins in Sudan ? 
@_date: 2015-09-16 19:06:30
I believe in bitcoin and fully support it ,, so I need to understand why it's 231 and not 241 ?? 
And how this can be used to use bitcoin as the main currency in some places where the currency is not tradable ,, 
@_date: 2015-09-16 19:56:18
I like your answer , and I will be happy to tell you that I ask to start my new bitcoin business ,, not to play it safe ,, safe is just not me :) ,,
Now days many people have problems with visa and banks transfer , maybe in my location so I'm planning to start money transferring service based on bitcoin .  
@_date: 2015-10-08 09:49:32

@_date: 2015-10-14 19:44:46

Hey , this is great , this may solve transaction problems .
In sudan there is two main points must be cleared before this become a reality in sudanese market :
1- how sudanese government will act about it ? - coz we all know all sudan problems comes out of the government acts -
2-  there is a need to start using bitcoin in sudan via a registered company to manage the ups and downs in the value of bitcoin and convince the sudanese that this is a legal and we can trust us.
In africa , ups and downs of the value of bitcoin in this big ranges may have disaster effects on poor peopleof sudan .
Finding solutions is the best way to promote bitcoin in sudan .

Bitcoin is hard to buy even with credit cards and banks ,, the fees reach more than 5% + banks fees ,,,
This have to be fixed first then the adoption will be global .
