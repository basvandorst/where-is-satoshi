I’m seeing an inverse Head and Shoulders looming on the 1h chart.... issue I have is yesterday’s fakeout hit the top of the down trend line 4h/1D and rejected. Thus in short  ������

A bull back is a sign of a healthy market

I had a good 15m scalp (short) out of BTC over the weekend based on seeing some divergence when Price wicked through 11k on Saturday but pretty much waiting it out

Will rest the underside ok 10k and drop to 6k then range

I had to look the meaning up ��
@_date: 2019-07-16 20:29:37
If price follows any form of Technical Analysis at all (which is doesn’t) price should test the previous resistance at 9K as support.....but we know BTC is a law on to itself ����

XRP upward channel is in a good time to buy, that’s if the arse doesn’t fall out of it ��....

Lol my finger is now over the buy too....price is being squeezed and should breakout all EMAs are underneath on the 1h
@_date: 2019-03-23 08:34:45
I bet that went down well with staff ����

Nice one buddy....I got in this time round at similar price and long term HODL. I also trade up &amp; down along the way
@_date: 2019-08-20 09:31:22
A 12k break and retest would be ideal
@_date: 2019-08-09 09:36:46
The 1h chart is key here for me showing LLs and flags looking for an impulse through 12k is my view

It’s looking like a head and shoulders formation isn’t going to materialise and 7500 has been preserved so far onwards and upwards ����
@_date: 2019-08-02 14:23:29
It’s been a healthy retracement so need to see price really push off now
@_date: 2019-02-16 01:26:39
It has no real use case outside of JPM

If the Libra hype pushes BTC higher then I’m all for it......other than that I can’t see Libra holding it’s own in the Crypto space, not that it’s really a crypto more. Bankers coin

How much
@_date: 2019-06-20 08:18:49
The anonymity element will certainly appeal to some. I set up an account to trial, it seems good and has a  decent GUI, the support chat did well under scrutiny. Offers good leverage and range of crypto pairs. Finding/withdrawals are only in BTC but very quick which will suit cryptoheads. Could be a good crypto broker as a new kid on the block and may soak up some of the Binance defectors.

Price dropping currently
@_date: 2019-06-06 17:45:11
I’d like to see a retest of 6500 and push long again
