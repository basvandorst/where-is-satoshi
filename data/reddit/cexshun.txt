My wife works in corporate banking, formerly a branch manager for consumer banking. I just asked her about this. Safe deposit boxes are not covered by bank insurance in anyway. Not theft, fire, flood, nothing. In fact, you're supposed to itemize your safe deposit box contents on your homeowner's insurance. So yeah, kind of the same thing actually.

I think that's one of the problems for new guys. It's hard to learn because most questions are answered with "Did you read the whitepaper?". The sub has always been a circle jerk, but just a different jerk. It used to jerk about BTC ending fiat and taking over the world as a superior method of economic payment. But now the jerk is about lambos and getting rich.
So 2 very different kind of discussions. I'm not one to judge which is better, but I do know which I prefer. But even the tech discussions about Lightning Network always devolve into BTC vs Bcash. And frankly, I'm just here to talk about Bitcoin, not bad mouth other cryptos.

About 5 years ago, this place was a lot different. As more and more people started buying so they could GRQ, it became a meme factory. And so many people here are still in the GRQ mindset, though they attempt to disguise it as being pro BTC technology.
I mean yeah, it was preachy back then too. I remember the slaying of the bear-whale as if it was a team effort to literally kill a person that was against the success of Bitcoin. But I also remember people praising Mtgox and claiming their issues wasn't an insolvency problem but instead a problem with the Chinese Yen. So maybe I am seeing the old with rose colored glass. I'll have to think on that one.
But you do have to wonder, if everyone here is so excited about the technology behind bitcoin, why is it never discussed? Why is everything about HODL and Lambos? And why would such a BTC supporter that fell into life changing amounts of money blow it on depreciating assets like Lambos and Teslas?

Visa caused me all kinds of legal troubles 10 years ago. I was buying cuban cigars online from Tokyo and shipping them to the US. As friends found out, they wanted to buy off of me. Over the next year, I was importing and bootlegging Cuban Cigars and making good money as more and more people found out.
The US government went to my supplier and requested a list of all US customers. Supplier told them to fuck off. So the government went to Visa, which turned over a record of all customers that had transactions with said supplier. By then, I was far past personal use amounts and got a nice love letter in the mail from US Customs. The fees and penalties were fairly massive.

I submitted a transaction yesterday for slightly less than that fee and it sat unconfirmed for 14 hours as the pool grew. At midnight, I said fuck it. Did a CPFP at a priority fee.

Does anyone else think that perhaps the difficulty in purchasing an Antminer is contributing to the problem? Bitmain has been extremely slow to release them in batches, and just browsing there are tons of people dying to buy one. And that sub is just a small sampling of miners. If Bitmain would start selling units instead of creating a shortage, I suspect we'd see a hash rate increase which would help the backlog.
To fix the problem, we either need to mine blocks faster or make the blocks bigger. LN is too far off, and we need some sort of stop gap. I've been waiting for the pool to drain to make a $1000 purchase with BTC, and it's been weeks now. And I can't even sell the BTC for fiat and make a purchase that way because I face the same problem attempting to get my coin on an exchange.
A store of value is great and all, but when it's not liquid, it's kind of useless.

Anything over 4 business days is the company fucking up.
ACH transfers are processed in blocks. So if you get the request in before noon, the request should be made same day. But let's say worst case scenario, you get it in at end of day. You have to wait until the next day for the transaction to be included in a block.
Now that block is sent to the third party processor(clearing house, the CH in ACH), which is the miner of fiat. ACH can be altered or reversed. So the CH holds the funds until the transaction is confirmed. It then forwards the transaction onto the final party for payment. This process takes 2 business days if using a 3rd party clearing house.
In no logical world should this take longer than 4 business days max. In fact, using a financial institution that serves as it's own CH directly will often yield the funds next day if you get the request in before the cutoff time.
tl;dr Coinbase has an extremely inefficient in house process that causes unnecessary delays, coupled with a shitty 3rd party clearing house.

Shift is the only one that I found that does not charge a maintenance fee. It also doesn't charge a funding fee, and only costs $10 for the card.
However, they do not publish their exchange rates. Coinbase plays with exchange rates by charging $100 more than market value for 1 BTC and giving you $100 less than market rates per BTC. I would assume they do the same with their Shift card, but I'm not certain since they are not published.

I spoke with Prusa over the past 2 weeks and got them to accept bitcoin. Preordered a new Prusa Mk3 3d printer to be delivered by the end of February.
Unfortunately whatever algorithm/payment processor they use severely undervalued bitcoin by a LARGE amount, so I paid through the nose. But it was still cheaper than sending the coin to an exchange, sell it, then ACH the funds to my bank. Those fees really stack up.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:30:08
I don't know of any exchanges that can serve as their own CH. So 3-4 days will likely be standard, and they'll quote 2-5 days to give themselves some cushion. No getting around this. However, I agree 12 days is insane, and I've had GDAX/CB ACH deposits take that long in my experience too. Usually it's 5 business days, which is still too long and points to in house laziness in processing.
Perhaps someone with more experience with the other exchanges can give you their experiences there. I switched to using my debit card on CB to make instant purchases and just eat the 3.99% fee as a cost of doing business. I never know when I'll need my coin in an emergency, and 4% seems like a small enough fee for the piece of mind of having my coin right now. But to many people on this sub, that fee is unacceptable.

Not to mention there's 2, maybe 3 mobile wallets that support segwit. And one of those is still in Alpha. Electrum released segwit support just a couple weeks ago for the desktop. There's not a lot of segwit options out there. Hell, there isn't a single mobile segwit wallet that supports HW wallets yet.
People want to use it. Wallets don't support it.
Edit: In fact, I'd say the overall wallet environment is currently abysmal. Segwit, HW wallet support, and custom fees should be the *bare minimum* features a wallet supports. Yet for some reason they are luxury features. And asking for RBF is like trying to get laid at church.

Depending on the card, there are many fees.
* fee to purchase the card
* fee to fund the card in addition to mining fees
* fee for ATM withdrawl
* fee for monthly maintenance
* fee for foreign currency transaction 
Plus hidden fees like valuing BTC at significantly less than market rates. Say the current price of BTC is 19,000. The debit card will value it at $18,750.

Even if you don't trust tumblers, there's a plethora of ways to anonymize BTC. LBC, shapshift/xmr.to, and many others. The anonymity is there if people are willing to pay the fees.
But I agree, something like XMR is probably better suited for the various DNMs. And XMR in general is a pretty interesting crypto. Although the requirement to run a full node in order for complete obfuscation is certainly a major drawback.

I've been waiting to move $1k in BTC for a month now, but it's not priority enough to eat these fees.

Residential apartment is meaningless. Fireworks enthusiasts that make large purchases for holidays often store equal or greater quantities of "explosives" in their small apartments. And anyone that reloads their own ammunition often has large amounts of "explosives" stored in their residential dwelling. Hell, anyone can rent an apartment and legally fill it floor to ceiling in every single room with consumer firecrackers that would far surpass the total weight Roger had on hand. I can store 50,000,000 devices that contain 30mg of comp legally. But if I have 1 device that contains 100mg of comp, I'm breaking the law and subject to the wrath of the ATF.
I did mention the mail system, and that was very likely the reason he was made an example out of. Although it is only a federal offense if he used USPS. As private shipping companies are not legally considered "the mail system", people that are sending illegal goods through the "mail" often use DHL/Fedex/UPS.

As a [federally licensed pyro]( I'll clear up this explosives stuff.
Consumer firecrackers are limited in the amount of explosive composition that they can contain. There is an exemption for agricultural use. So several manufacturers attempted to use this loophole by creating "overloaded" firecrackers, generally known as M80s to the public, and sold them as agricultural pest control products. Anyone could purchase these as a grey market item. The loophole was very similar to the herbal fake drugs sold as "For incense use only. Not for human consumption" when everyone knew what they were being sold as.
Roger bought a whole lot of them wholesale and was reselling them online. But just as the government laughed at the salvia/Spice loophole, they laughed at this firecracker loophole. Now, as a federal licensed explosive handler, this kind of thing is extremely common, and still happens to this day. The feds picked Roger and made an example out of him. The difference between Roger and the thousands of bootleggers out there is that Roger sold them online and shipped them. The other bootleggers simply sold them face to face.
While I am not a Roger supporter, and am fully invested in BTC, I feel the need to clear up this explosive stuff as a professional fireworks operator as I find it greatly overblown and exaggerated.

My only concern with this product is the quality of electronics. In the electronic cigarette industry, the market is ripe with clones. 
Most of them, when examined in detail, use inferior quality electronic internals. They may use 5% resistors when the original used 1%. Higher failure rate, poorer quality solder joints, and a lower MTBF. Skimping on component quality is an easy way to make something for cheaper, thus sell it cheaper.
If I ordered one of these, and it fails due to using a ceramic capacitor instead of electrolytic, my BTC are stuck until I order a new one and twiddle my thumbs as the replacement crawls over on a boat from the Chinese mainland.

I'm curious about this **easily spend it** you speak of. Every hardware wallet I've seen requires immediate access to an internet connected PC with a USB interface and cable. The nature of BTC requires internet connection. Therefore, hardware wallets will be useless for anything other than cold storage until they start integrating cellular modems in them. 
I'm holding out for the next gen wallets that can access the blockchain directly without the PC intermediary. Or at the very least be able to pair with my cellphone to use the net. THAT will be able to **easily spend it**.

I agree with both of your points. 
I'm just thinking about BTC vs cash and the things BTC has to do to catch up to the convenience.
Say I go into a shop and they have a widget unexpectedly on sale for $500. I don't keep that kind of cash in my mobile hot wallet. So I have to go home, transfer money from the Trezor to my hot wallet using my PC, then return to the store. On top of that, I have to hope they didn't sell the last one because the price is insanely low. And the type of people that own Trezors for security are the type of people that probably wouldn't trust large amounts of BTC in a mobile hot wallet for even a short period of time anyway.
Compared to cash where I simply go to an ATM or bank branch and make a withdrawl. Or use the mobile app to transfer funds from savings to checking. Or I can call my bank on the phone and have them transfer the funds for me.
A 4G modem in a Trezor is trivially easy to do from both a hardware and software standpoint. The larger issue is cutting a deal with a cell provider. Devices like the various 3G ebook readers cut deals with AT&amp;T for lifetime free data usage on the networks. I doubt Trezor has that kind of pull. But if the device could accept a sim card for mobile data access, it would be a total game changer. Toss on a QR code reader and you're all set. That would be a true digital wallet!

You now have 1 bathroom for standing business and 1 for sitting business. No gender necessary. You use the room that fits your needs. It makes optimal use of the available space and keeps the process efficient.

Odd, because this transaction I sent on 11-11 from private key to private key (and segwit) took over 40 hours with a $3.20 fee, which according to Electrum was around 350 sat/b. And that was after 12 hours of nothing and issuing a RBF to try and push it through.
If I'm not making a micro transaction, I'm not too worried about high fees. I'm worried about transaction time. Because someone is probably willing to risk a 0 confirmation on a $5 coffee. Not so much on $200, meaning I have to wait, and wait, and wait. 
And this is why these attacks scare me. Not because of high fees. If there's an emergency and I need to liquidate a few BTC to fiat so I can cover it, this transaction (which was estimated within the next 25 blocks when I first made it by 3 different fee estimators) could have had serious consequences. And if the entire ecosystem can be brought to its knees by a handful of pissed off dudes, there's a problem that needs to be addressed. If BTC grows to mass adoption, an incident like we had this weekend would have catastrophic consequence on the economy.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:44:50
No doubt. When I got into Bitcoin, the fantasy ideal was that it was going to eliminate fiat and take over the world. But everytime the fees jump to 300sat/b, people change their tune.

Transaction has to be broadcast within 10 minutes. They wait for 1 confirmation, then fulfill the order. Just like most other BTC payment processing services.

Took 5 days, but they did refund my BTC. They did not fill the order. They will also deduct the miner fee to send you the refund from your actual refund. This happened to a LOT of people. Check their support center and the sub This was not an isolated incident.
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:58:18
So by your rationale, if I don't somehow time the blocks just right and magically force a block to be mined within 10 minutes of me clicking send, then the transaction is null and void. And somehow their T&amp;C saying they are allowed to cancel transactions at will makes them less of an asshole? I never said anything about legal. I said they are fucking scummy, just like any company that would cancel a pending order that occurs right before the market starts to tank. If egifter did this, they'd be hung from the rafters by this sub.
And if it is the way you say it is, they really should update their front end that moves from "Awaiting payment" to "Awaiting exchange". Because it moves to "Awaiting Exchange" as soon as the transaction is broadcost. Which their FAQ once again states "We received your order and are currently processing you order"

Same thing happened on Shapeshift. Money was received, transaction marked as "Your alt coins will be processed soon", then nothing. They claim it was a "bug on our end" and refunded money.
Here's the thing. It's obvious. They were losing money due to the market taking a dump and suspended all order fills. If my order would have been filled, I would have made out like a bandit as the exchange rate was locked in. I placed an order at 6800, then the hash rate went to shit and the price dropped to 5500 by the time my transaction was confirmed. But my rate was locked in, so I was getting XMR as if BTC was still trading at 6800.
When the market rebounded, they began responding to tickets and simply refunding the BTC. I only lost the mining fees and the fee to return my BTC was deducted from the refund. The bigger concern is I lost out on a couple BTC profit as I was making a market move on Monero.
So yeah, fuck both companies for screwing over their customers and lying about it. This was not a bug. This was them intentionally suspending all transactions that were not in their favor, then refunding them after the market corrected. I've opened an account on Bittrex and do my current swaps there now.

I think it can be very important. If bitcoin is not money nor currency, then users are simply trading goods. No sales tax can be levied. However, sales tax can then be charged on the purchase of bitcoin. It is not a currency exchange. Therefore, on top of the already hefty fees that bitcoin exchanges charge, the government could very well levy a tax on it. It can also be argued that since they do not exist, theft of bitcoin and scamming is not illegal. Just as it was ruled in court that Diablo II items were not real, thus did not constitute theft. Even if they did show value on online marketplaces.
If it is money or currency, then we cannot be taxed during the currency exchange. Instead, the tax must be levied on the product as sales tax. This opens the door for the old "Can't catch the drug dealers, so go after them for tax evasion" legal battle. Also, theft of bitcoin through direct theft or scamming now becomes a real legal thing.
The argument itself is very important.

You never mention what your business is, and that's the key to all of this. My wife works for Chase Corporate, previously as a branch manager. Chase has a list of industries they do not wish to do business with. As a branch manager, there were several occasions where my wife was forced to hand a customer a check for their balance and inform them Chase no longer wishes to do business with them. High on the list of businesses Chase will close their account are strip clubs.
And to give accurate information, Chase will freeze the account for 10 days, then after 10 days if the funds are still there, they will mail you a check. The manager of the branch you went to could/should have made a phone call, unfroze your account, gave you your funds, then refroze the account pending a forced close. Although the manager can do this, they are not required to. So if you were rather aggressive, the manager could have just said "Fuck this guy" instead of going through the previous mentioned procedure.

Unfortunately, Chase will never tell you why they closed your account. And the branch won't even be told. They have entire teams that are tasked with closing accounts. And they don't advertise the reasons as that would allow shady companies to avoid those red flags. My wife cited a recent account closure where a woman's account was closed because she is married to a football player that had an extremely negative quote published in the newspaper.

I rarely spend more than $50 here and there, and use my Copay mobile wallet for those purchases that is not managed with Trezor. I'm uncomfortable having over $1000 in a mobile wallet for a weekend. That's the whole reason I purchased the Trezor and did so when I had my first $250 worth of BTC.
If I were making a $7000 purchase for a new rig, I'd just pay them from home and pick it up there. But when it's a weekend where I am spending an unknown amount between 0 and 1500, I'm more hesitant.

Really? He has issues with the cost of moving a bunch of money around, and you're response is some pendantic rant that he's using the wrong denomination and thinking about it wrong? Look, he converted satoshi per byte to USD to draw a parallel to economic value. We don't need to do that conversion with USD because the economy is built on that unit. We know how many apples we can buy with $1 USD. We do not know how many apples we can buy with satoshi per byte. So if he wants to compare a fee to economic value, a conversion must happen.
The same thing happens in any trade. If I'm trading baseball cards, the conversion of their value to USD is a must to know if it's a fair trade. Sure, a Babe Ruth card will always be a Babe Ruth card. But any sane person is going to look at the value in the current Babe Ruth/USD market and trade based upon that value.

I loved my first jump, then as I was leaving, I noticed a sign at the desk saying they accepted BTC. That sealed the deal and I enrolled in the course.
Large amounts in a hot wallet with locally saved keys is what concerns me. For some reason, I never considered using Trezor to create a new traditional wallet within a mobile app. That certainly eases my mind. I keep confusing the concept that the Trezor stores the keys, not the wallet, so I'm free to use it as many times and places as I need to.

Well, the clearing house is the blockchain of the fiat world. It is basically making sure people aren't double spending their currency. And if they are, it gets bounced back as NSF. But it's taking 2-3 days to do what the blockchain can do in theoretically 10 minutes.
And I've used plenty of services that accept my bitcoin transaction as soon as it's broadcast rather than waiting for a confirmation. I've purchased many Steam codes that were emailed to me long before the transaction was mined in a block. So yeah, there are services in Bitcoin-land that operate similar to Zelle.

A powerful rig helps, but the money is in the mangling rules. As someone active in the security researching community, JTR experts do not share their custom mangling rules. A good ruleset is worth a LOT of money. There's a hashed password dump floating around out there that is often used as a benchmark for custom rules. the default ruleset in JTR will crack about 24%. My filthy casual custom rules were able to crack around 60% of the hashes. The best of the best that do this kind of thing for a living are well over 95%. The current record is over 97%.
But honestly, if you already have a good idea of what the password might be, it won't take very long at all with a good set of rules. The powerful rig comes into play when you have to use a dictionary list in addition to mangling rules. A 1 million word dictionary list takes a lot longer to run through mangling rules than a 1 word dictionary list.

Happens in 1 of 2 ways.
First, you both have the same bank. Therefore you have an off chain transaction where the bank just makes a line in the ledger.
Or, you have different banks. In which case, the money takes 2-3 business days to transfer through a clearing house. Zelle takes the risk by fronting your friend that money and gets repaid when the clearing house releases the funds.
The actual banking system is incredibly slow, and basically operates on millions of dollars of electronic IOUs in order to make it seem fast.

I'll look into that. Although bitmit tended to have better pricing on many things. Sadly, I suspect some of it, like the $8 for 1 year of hulu, was due to less than legal means.
Edit: UGH, 5% fee. I'd rather deal with someone that accepts BTC directly. Charging a fee to use a preferred currency rubs me the wrong way.

I'm 32, a senior IT administrator, and I had 200 coins that I paid between $3.45 and $5.50 for over the course of about 3 months. Sold at $235 when the writing on the wall was screaming crash. I made a fucking killing.

I'd rather be able to interpret a market chart than a title I suppose.

So are we trying to make Bitcoin better than banks and fiat? Because whenever a complicated issues arises, everyone avoids dealing with it by saying "banks do it this way, so we should to". 
That's not a solution unless Bitcoin is intended to be a clone of fiat that merely lies outside regulations. But again, you are proposing regulation in allowing a central authority power to steal coins. 
That method does nothing more than replace the current government with a new government. And that will eventual corrupt also. 
No thanks. The only one who should have authority over my coin is me.

Many wallets on SR that are known to belong to SR. So if you deposit to one of them, no matter how well it's tumbled, there is still a record that your wallet sent BTC to an SR wallet. Ideally, the tumbling should be done between your account and SR, not between SR and the dealers.
They key is to not allow yourself to be connected to any wallet address that will be making a transaction you don't want linked to yourself.
If I know my best friends wallet because we send each other BTC, and I know the wallet of the sex toy shop down the block, it's very easy for me to examine the blockchain and catch my friend buying sex toys.

I don't think you understand what panic selling is. Saying "My money has increased 1000 fold on this investment. That is enough for me and I'm happy with my returns" is not panic selling. That is damned smart investing.

People keep saying this without reading the print.
Blockchain: "Due to restrictions from Apple the bitcoin wallet functionaility is not available in the app store version."
Coinbase has had its app pulled from the app store twice now. 
Coinjar has been removed from the store.
My friends are still waiting on an ios wallet. iPhone lovers on love to point out all of these apps that are not available any longer.
Edit: Instead of downvoting me, please direct me to a fully functional wallet app on the store. My friend and my 2 brothers would love it. I may even tip you.

The only thing more dangerous than some with a financial stake giving you advise is someone with a moral stake giving you advise. is both sides of that. Meaning anyone that takes the advice here as anything more than mental masturbation is dumb.

My wife is a manager at Chase. Chase has been slowly closing the accounts of strip clubs claiming they do not want that kind of business. 
Her branch is near several such clubs. So far, she has twice been ordered to decline their deposite and hand them a check for their account balance. 
This is not rare gentleman.

That happens a lot with self taught programmers. As a person who hires programmers, I'm in awe everyday over the shit I see.
