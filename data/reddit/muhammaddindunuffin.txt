Because people disagree? 
Why force a huge global change when you can't even convince somebody on the internet?

I vote you remain in your WoW universe, and I'll remain in mine.

Anything not entirely imaginary (like your example you picked) can be used as currency.  You can Google the difference between money and currency if you like.
@_date: 2017-05-04 22:34:54
Who picks who controls the currency then? 
@_date: 2017-05-05 05:05:23
You say that but provide no backing, no reasoning, no arguments. Instead why don't you look into why others would consider it a bad idea, why it would never happen, and who stands to benefit.  This isn't a novel subject and you didn't just come up with the idea yourself. Go, read.
Value is subjective, good. How does that tie into using one value system for the entire world, then?

What could possibly go wrong with that mentality
@_date: 2017-05-05 03:39:41
Something you should have asked your high school economics professor

Says the one who clearly slept through class wanting his own personal version of imaginary money to be used for global currency and can't understand why it isn't already so. You have no  perception of value so no insult taken whatsoever.

Money to some is toilet paper to others, or turns into trash when markets crash overnight or internet dies. Value is subjective remember?

Pick a currency and I'll tell you who controls most of it.
@_date: 2017-05-04 23:18:28
That's not a currency. Pick again.
@_date: 2017-05-05 05:18:58
You can be anything you want when you grow up, actually. Don't sell yourself short.
@_date: 2017-05-04 23:29:10
Is it only in your imagination? Then you have a monopoly on it.
@_date: 2017-05-05 03:16:28
Who prints it? Who controls the interest rates? Who decides on numerous other minutiae about currency you are completely ignoring?
@_date: 2017-05-05 05:16:05
Yes, one world currency is such a simple concept, which cannot be distilled down  any simpler. It's obviously how the world should operate. Only simple minded people would dare to disagree with you. Quick, call the worlds economists and leaders, they badly need you!

If you think children, mentally ill or criminals  getting guns or  drugs illegally is arbitrary politics then you've lost me totally.

You want to make  transactions with the money
Go ahead and mine some coin if you want to skip the exchange​ 
@_date: 2017-05-05 05:18:23
Incredible research, you've clearly studied this for years.
@_date: 2017-05-05 03:52:13
Not sure where you are going with that, so I'll offer you this: Imagine you traded prescription drugs for a handgun. Both owned legally by their owners, but once traded both become illegal in the hands of the other. Same objects, but completely different.

Have you ever been given wrong change? Bought a faulty product? Got counterfeit money? Check that bounced? Someone on Craigslist try to steal the phone you were trying to sell them? Plenty of reasons to have a middle man

A little better than my Intro to Critial Thinking but not quite up to Econmics 101 level. You?
