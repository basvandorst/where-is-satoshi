That paper provides a very interesting read and confirms things that many of us have been thinking for some time now - malleability is a bullshit cover story and the vast majority of the attacks have happened AFTER the press release
Thanks for linking this - I've learned a LOT from reading the paper

I hope this isn't a stupid question but the document mentions a loss over a time scale of years, but the analysis done by Ken Shirriff indicates that no appreciable amount of transactions has been modified before just a couple weeks ago
Given that the block chain is public record anybody should be able to check this.  Aren't these 2 statements completely at odds?

That's pretty harsh - what he said is quite accurate.  Hell, it just happened here:

That's exactly how it sounds to me, or possibly there was a slightly different command set used in the modified transactions they are suffering from.  I noticed in the article I liked he only explores a very particular method of modifying the transactions.  It is probably the case that another command could be inserted.

Not if you send them to ONE of those addresses, but each time it does generate a new address, and if you run past the set of 100 pre-generated ones that are in your backup you will not be able to recover those coins.  Always receiving at the same address does not put you at risk for this, however if you send coins from this client it will silently send some back to you and consume your receive addresses.  After this is done for some time (i.e. over 100 times) you will exhaust the pool of addresses in your wallet.dat backup and if you ever restore from that backup you will lose the coins you had at any of your receive addresses (possibly ALL of your coins!!)

You are neglecting to consider the additional fees, some of which are usage based.  The true cost is unfortunately much higher.
Source: I am a previous Enmax customer who just moved from Calgary to BC and despite now paying more per KWh and using more electricity per month I pay less per month.

He is only considering the raw per-KWh cost advertised on his bill, but privatization of the electricity market in Alberta means they hide costs in other categories, some of which are usage based.  It’s not actually that cheap.  I have paid more than 10 years of electric bills in Alberta.

You are either a liar or have never traded anything since signing up

When the bitcoin ATM launched there it was sort of promoted as a coffee shop that takes bitcoin.  I went there with a friend and we were moderately disappointed to learn that the person working the counter had no idea what bitcoin was, or if they would ever accept bitcoins directly.  I'm glad they have advanced past that.
I still keep a small amount of bitcoin on my phone just in case I find somewhere that accepts it.

Perhaps things are different in your country but in mine (Canada) the merchant does NOT get the funds if a stolen credit card was used.  I've had enough of those come back through the place I used to work to be certain of this.  The legitimate cardholder disputes the charge, we have to provide proof that it was them making the transaction (signed slip) and after we provide that we are told too bad, it wasn't a legitimate transaction, better luck next time.
