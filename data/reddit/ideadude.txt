Not sure why you view investment made on credit as a gamble where investment made with savings is not. Is it riskier to invest on credit? For banks I guess, but that's why they charge interest. Credit isn't inherently evil. It allows lots of investment that wouldn't happen without it.
The idea that inflation encourages spending is not novel. Wikipedia covers the "Mundell-Tobin effect" here: 
And I liked the reply here: 
In general, the common sense understanding here is that if your money is inflating away, you want to do something with it besides keep it in the mattress/etc... i.e. spend it in some way.


Again, I think "speculation" is not a necessarily a bad thing and is an important part of our economy and society.


I read a bit. I invest and spend some time almost every day reading and thinking about this kind of stuff. I am interested in opposing views. The idea that savings "encourages" investment or at least enables it by banks is interesting and I just did a bunch of reading on that after reading your comment here.
I think these things do get almost religious pretty quickly though. You either believe that inflation encourages spending or you don't. And if you think all inflation is bad, it's rare that I'll find someone who will change their mind. And I really don't want to spend much more time looking up references and replying to these comments, which is why I said this conversation won't go anywhere. Mostly, I'm going to stop replying at some point.

Pyramid/ponzi scheme is just a buzzword that makes bitcoin sound bad, but bitcoin is not arranged as a pyramid scheme any more than any other asset people can purchase on a market. It's more like a stock or commodity prone to bubbles since growth is large and the true value is hard to calculate.

Step 2. Mortgage your house. (Or take a loan from some wealthy people.)

In a healthy economy, wages will inflate as fast as products. However, we know that has not been the case in the US recently. Instead of removing inflation, we could raise wages.
Edit: Doh, finished your comment which says "Some of it (but not all!) is offset by salary increase due to inflation adjustment"


It's really simple and I know this conversation will go nowhere, but the truth is that having a little bit of inflation encourages investment over savings which has a positive impact on the economy. Of course too much inflation would be bad, just like too much saving is bad as well.

I agree. Made me wonder why Coinbase and others were so eager to get the statement out there. Either they wanted to kick Gox while it was down or they were really worried about what a price crash would do to their companies.
@_date: 2014-02-08 18:32:12
I think it's very possible that their risk calculation takes into account information about you (your credit check, etc) as well as other information like recent price volatility and how many coins Coinbase has on hand or how many other risky orders Coinbase is processing.
So your information might be the same, but those other risk factors changed and so your order was denied.

Buying stock (especially IPOs and other offerings) is like a direct loan to the company instead of first going into savings and then the bank lending the money.
Banks don't necessarily lend more money just because they have more. That has been a problem in this most recent recession where banks were just sitting on their money because loans were (probably rightly) seen as risky.
(Searched for "banks aren't lending" and found this. I also remember my failed attempts to get a business loan around that time.)
[The problem with Fed QE—banks just aren’t lending](
Better yet, more people will buy boats and houses and stuff vs save when inflation is present which goes directly into the economy.


Not all risk is bad. It's kind of an important part of capitalism.


It's not my magic number, it's the target of the Fed. From [the Fed website](




As long as I'm making 2x per year, I don't mind that things will cost 2x 30 or so years from now. If I buy assets that appreciate at &gt; 2% per year I'm better off yet.
RE spending vs savings, I'm thinking of the Paradox of Thrift type stuff that is referenced in lots of economic thinking. 
If you read the criticisms there (you'll see your savings = more money for banks to lend idea), note that a lot of them aren't applicable in present day USA with near 0% interest rates already and sticky prices that won't fall.

Thing is the people running the pool aren't necessarily also invested in it. Especially Ghash.IO that gets 0% fees. (They probably are to some extent but not the whole 51%/etc.)
So a pool with 0% fees could get 51% power and none of the financial benefit of it. One way to benefit would be to short the market and blow it up.

Indirectly, they are. Say inflation is about 2%/year. Then it's risky to save your money in a bank getting 1%/year interest. You'd be effectively losing 1%/year. So instead, you put at least some more of your money into the stock market or some other investment that means that money will work its way into the economy instead of sitting on the sidelines.

Sometimes investing seems easy. On a smaller scale, I remember when Take-Two/Rockstar released Grand Theft Auto 5 and made over $1Billion in just a few days. All of the video game news sites had headlines with the big $1B number and it even was picked up in mainstream news. I checked out the stock price action expecting there to be a big run up... there wasn't. The stock was still trading at just a bit above a $1B market cap still.
I searched and searched for a catch (did they have some debt that no one knew about?), but there was nothing. I bought some stock. On their next earnings call, they blew the numbers out of the water and the stock nearly doubled from there in a short amount of time.
This is just a story to illustrate the point that sometimes "investors" are just out of the loop. In the case of TTWO and GTA5, there was a very well publicized event with a clear financial correlation. No matter how you did the math, TTWO had hundreds of millions of dollars more than they thought they would. The stock was priced as if they were going out of business, but what company releasing the biggest selling game of all time would go out of business? 
Eventually these companies and ideas make the cold hard cash and put them on the balance sheet and at that time, it's really hard to ignore things and under price the assets.
Right now, Bitcoin is priced with some multiple over the current value. But it's like a 2-3x value... not the 20-30x, or 200-300x value that seems obvious to people who think about the true potential.
The biggest risk IMO is that an alt coin takes over Bitcoin's place, but I feel that the amount of money and effort invested into Bitcoin gives a lot of people the motivation to make sure that Bitcoin either adapts to compete with whatever the alt coin brings or that the existing network is used somehow (e.g. colored coins). At the very least, if you are someone reading this subreddit, you will likely get an early warning to bail out of Bitcoin when the "next big thing" comes along. You might lose some money, but I don't think the price goes $230 to $1 overnight.
Good luck everyone!
@_date: 2015-05-22 18:36:54


Yes. I get it.


That's the point. The price DIDN'T go up when the news was already out that GTA 5 was selling more than expected. And I'm looking back again and the price didn't even go up when the quarterly report came out in October that already included the $1B in sales. It wasn't until 2014 when the price started ticking up further.
There are always other things to consider (my guess is there was so much profit taking from people who invested &lt; $12), and investing isn't always easy. But when a company makes something like 20% of their market cap in one quarter (and the stock price doesn't move), it seems like a really easy bet to load up shares.


You're taking this a little to literal. I searched around for other news related to the company to help explain why when they basically get something like $500m in found money the market cap didn't go up by $500m. Did everyone already know about it (didn't seem like it this time, although that is often the case)? Or was their something else holding the company back?
If you think Take Two will continue to sell $1B+ of GTA games every other year, then it's incredibly cheap even at $27/share. 
If you think Apple will continue to make $50b/year, the stock is incredibly cheap at $130/share. 
If you think Tesla can sell hundreds of thousands of poweralls and electric cars each year, then it's still cheap at $246/share. 
If you think Bitcoin is going to be used for XYZ and hit a "market cap" of $100b+, then it's incredibly cheap at $230/coin.
The folks who don't believe those things are selling the stock/etc and keeping the price down. To some of us, it seems obvious that these things will happen (or we at least weight the risks differently from the average folk) and so we can load up while prices are low. Eventually the money will be in the bank so to speak and the market will have no choice but to raise valuations.

I think we underestimate our "insider" knowledge of things. 
The average video games analyst on Wall Street doesn't seem to be as in tune with games as someone like me watches Twitch.tv while working, plays like 30m a day, and reads VG news on the toilet. The actual investors in the stocks know even less.
So when companies are undervalued and turning around, it seems really obvious to us that GTA5 is going to make a ton of money, but investors are unsure if "Take Two can produce another hit like it has in the past."
Similarly, we understand that the Bitcoin technology is a game changer and just needs some time to infiltrate our everyday lives. Others will question if "Bitcoin is a fad".

It's too late. Your 1 BTC is safe, but you lost your chance to get your free 1 BCC.
Coinbase said that they wouldn't be crediting BCC or otherwise doing anything with it for customers. So if you wanted your one BCC for your one BTC, you needed to move your BTC off of Coinbase into a wallet you controlled and had private keys for. You needed to do this before midnight last night... so a couple days ago if you had your BTC in a Coinbase "vault" to account for the security delay.
Some people suspected Coinbase didn't really own all of the BTC they said they did since when you purchase BTC there, you just see a # on your account page and have no real way to audit if they REALLY purchased BTC on your behalf. However, Coinbase didn't seem to have any problems (besides the usual) moving people's BTC out of vaults this weekend when a lot of people were doing that to get their BCC.

You give him too little credit based on the fact that he's not as excited as you are about Bitcoin or the Internet.
[His comments on the internet in 1998]( (from a tongue in cheek story written in the midst of dotcom histeria) are overblown (it's his "calling card"?) just like Bill Gate's 256MB of RAM (or whatever it was) story. Bill Gates isn't dumb. He doesn't have a limited view of what computers can be used for. Krugman isn't dumb, and doesn't think that the internet "isn't viable". He makes his living mostly on the internet these days, and while he's as fuddy-duddy as anyone his age, he's generally more forward thinking than his peers (he's a fan of Asimov's Foundation series and Psychohistory).
His last prediction from that article is telling about what he was up against in terms of the mentality of people toward the internet then (emphasis mine):


By 2005, the Internet hadn't really changed things as much as it has in the 10 years since. And in that time I think Krugman has realized how the internet is important and also where it's not important.
Edit: [Krugman's response to the 1998 comments coming up recently](




With regards to Bitcoin, I think he's just not thinking about Bitcoin as a technology at all. The typical questions he deals with day to day are like:
* Should the US go back to the gold standard?
* Should Greek leave the Euro for their own currency?
* Should country X stop tying their currency to the USD or the Euro.
* Should the US raise or lower interest rates.
So when Bitcoin comes up, it's natural for him to think "Should Bitcoin replace other currencies" instead of "how will the technology behind Bitcoin disrupt money". I think he doesn't even address Bitcoin on the level it needs to be and probably doesn't think he's equipped to judge the technology. 
Despite his fondness for Asimov (or maybe because of), he probably like most people suffers from linear thinking vs exponential thinking and doesn't really account for the fact that technological advances of all kinds are likely to happen more rapidly going forward. 
But even then things will probably happen slower than us optimists think. Bitcoin probably isn't going to replace USD over the next couple years, or couple decades. And while it's likely to grow into something really big, and Krugman jokes about the price being a bubble, I think that's more to due with his inability to gauge investments (he doesn't tackle stock or company valuations either -- he's a macro guy). He likely has no idea how the price of Bitcoin is computed or what it means and doesn't typically tackle problems like that.

I read all of his blog posts and editorials and it's the opposite actually.
He writes 80% of the time about US and international economics. About 1 in 10 of his posts are marked as "wonky" and get into the particulars of economic theory. His columns are often political, but typically they focus on the economic stances of politicians and how to relate to them. He sometimes strays from economics into pure political opinion (his writing on health care is only partially motivated by the economics behind it). But most of his writing has to do with the area of study he's comfortable in: economics.
The problem is that between election years, nobody outside of loyal readers pay attention his articles on economic matters, and it's only his spats with conservative politicians and economics that get publicized.
@_date: 2015-07-17 18:04:22
I agree.  There are a lot of comments in previous threads and on [this recent post in that say Krugman is dumb or doesn't know anything about money. The truth is he studies and writes about money for a living and probably knows more about it than almost anyone else on the planet. Specifically, he thinks about money in an abstract way as shown by [his Baby Sitter Club]( thought experiment. His focus on Japanese deflation in the 90s and international trade before that had him doing a lot of thinking and writing about how different currencies work against each other. While he may not get the technology behind Bitcoin (which is important for him to get), he understands money.
It's also important to understand the context he answers these questions in: basically "will Bitcoin replace the USD"? 
And it's important to understand context of what Krugman has been writing about in economics lately. In the midst of people who are against "printing money" and the acts of the Federal Reserve, he's basically defending the fact that recent Fed acts have had a stabilizing effect on the economy, prevented a deflationary spiral, and haven't raised inflation like people worried. If USD were more like Bitcoin (with no levers to raise the money supply), the 2008 recession would probably have been a lot worse. 
He's also recently writing about Greece a case where their inability to control their money (cause they use Euros instead of their own currency) has caused major issues over there. While Bitcoin might be a good investment vs the drachma if it came back, Bitcoin couldn't have done anything to prevent what happened to the Greek economy.
So Krugman sees a currency with no monetary controls and no inflation and (rightly in my opinion) argues that it's not better than government-backed money. So systematically it's not better to him. And he thinks credit cards are good enough, so from a consumer standpoint it's not better.
I agree. However, it doesn't mean that Bitcoin is useless. There is a need and use for non-government backed money like this, and it can live in harmony with USDs, Euros, and other money. I wish Krugman did more thinking about how Bitcoin could exist alongside other currencies, similar to gold reserve or other transactional assets.
Krugman's concerns are still important for people to address:
1. How is it easier to use than credit cards?
2. What "backs" it if not the faith of a sovereign nation or a useful resource like gold?
I would argue these answers:
1. Sometimes you want to use digital "cash" vs digital "credit". Also lower fees are important on everyday credit card transactions (0% vs 3%) but are important in remittances (5-10% vs 30%).
2. The public ledger is a useful system for verifying ownership of other things outside of Bitcoin and we'll ultimate find the systems built on top the blockchain useful enough to warrant keeping the system running which will provide a base demand for Bitcoins.
TL;DR: I think Krugman is a smart person, and we should spend more time trying to win him over to our side instead of just vilifying or ignoring him.

I like the Myspace comparison. Facebook took over by starting on college campuses. It worked better for that niche. The niche was big enough for Facebook to get huge and good and then expanded outside of colleges into businesses and then opened for everyone.

This is the comment to upvote. People are underestimating the effects that earlier technology had on the economy. Krugman obviously singled out the fax machine for humor's sake. But the impact of steam engines, diesel engines, container ships, telephones, etc etc etc were all pretty big.
The reality is that we have the same levels of GDP growth (lower even) than in the past. For sure, the Internet has had a big impact on things, and there are lots of companies making money using Internet technologies. Very few businesses can survive these days without using some kind of Internet-powered technology. However, Krugman's point about the Internet not having a large impact *relative to past breakthroughs* on productivity or the economy in general is not as stupid as it sounds. And it seemed downright genius just 2 years before the NASDAQ crashed.
I thought that Krugman had addressed the fax machine comment in the past. Maybe it wasn't on his blog. This is the closest I could find using Google (although someone seems to post that fax machine quote in the comments of a lot of his posts).

None that I know of. If you have a 6BTC per month salary, you'll be okay. But you probably have a $6000 USD per month salary (etc) and so if/when the USD/BTC price goes up, you'll have to convert more of your USD to BTC to pay your loan payments.
A deflationary currency will be bad for credit and loans. With the price of a Bitcoin going up 10-100x, it's insane to take out a loan in Bitcoin. Even when things settle down (when is that, btw, at $1M USD per Bitcoin?) there will always be a deflationary bias and no central bank equivalent to try to keep things in balance. So at some point in the future, it may not be insane to take out a loan in Bitcion, but there will still be less incentive to do so.
BTW, the reverse is true. If you have higher inflation, it makes your loan payments go down in relative terms. (Because what people often forget is that wages tend to inflate along with the cost of goods.) This is why some may prescribe higher inflation as a solution to the credit crisis we are in. If Americans are spending less because they have so much debt, we can simply inflate away some of that debt to get them spending again. People with negative net worths will benefit. People with positive net worths will (wealthy and fixed income people) will lose out.
This all is not to say that Bitcoin is not useful and won't be successful. It just means that it's not as well suited for some things (like spending and loaning out) as other currencies. While the deflation bias in Bitcoin is bad for somet things, it's good for others (like storing value or transfering value).

A couple other valuation methods that are worth discussing:
One commenter says that "Paypal did $5.6 billion last year". This is about 3-4x the $1.5 B in bitcoin out there now.
I commented on comparing bitcoin to GDP or GSP (gross state products). Pennsylvania has a GSP of $500B+. Will there ever be as much economic activity in bitcoin as there is inside of Pennsylvania? This is 300+x the current valuation.
Another I've heard is to compare bitcoin to Western Union, which does money transfers and has a market cap of $10B. So if you imagine bitcoin as a "company" that competes with Western Union and will be used as much as Western Union is, you could think of it as having a market cap of $10B, about 6-7x increase in current value.

By "price floor", Krugman means what is going to keep the value of a Bitcoin from going to $0 (or just really low compared to current prices).
The truth is that everyone could collectively decide to stop using Bitcoins and only use Litecoins, or some other clone. If this happens, Bitcoins become worthless.
Gold will always be useful for jewelry. USD will always be useful for paying US taxes.
Phanpp says that the "protocol" behind Bitcoin is useful and creates a price floor. I'm not so sure. The Bitcoin protocol is useful, but it's also easy to copy. Some Bitcoin-like currency will surely be in use in the future, but why Bitcoin over the other alternatives?
I think it's worth exploring how big the Bitcoin "moat" really is. Under what scenarios would the Bitcoin miners and Bitcoin wealthy switch from Bitcoin to another coin?

$1 M per coin = 1,000,000 x 15 M coins (circa 2015) = ~~$1.5~~ $15 Trillion total market cap.
As comparison Canada, Australia, and Spain all have about $1.5 Trillion GDP each. The US has a ~$15 Trillion GDP.
One could argue that when as much commerce is being done in BitCoins as is being done in ~~Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, or Euros in Spain~~ all of the US, 1 BTC should be about $1 M USD.

Yeah, technically you "realize the gain" when you buy something with the BitCoins whether you are buying USD or a sandwich.
Interesting point RE having to calculate that tax every time you buy something. I tried to write up some easier ways to do, but there really isn't an easy answer. Of course as a digital currency, someone could eventually automate this for us.
This isn't an unknown problem though. I make hundreds and hundreds of stock trades without knowing the tax implications exactly and then hand that over to my accountant each year and he figures it out for me.

I was worried because of things I saw on Reddit and the fact that there was a $20 increase in BTC price while my order was pending, but it went through this morning.
It should be noted that their "fraud prevention algorithm" would rightly and not maliciously tighten up as the price of BTC became more volatile and there is more risk in general. It's very likely not something like "price went up = fail everyone".

Just chiming in to say that I bought 5 BTC using CoinBase on Monday when the price was around $75. I verified my phone and bank account using the login method. The transaction was set to go through today (Friday) at 1am.
During the week, the price of BTC jumped to $95 and I was concerned that my purchase wouldn't go through (some on Reddit had suggested that the fraud prevention algorithm tagged them especially when the price of BTC went up), but I'm happy to report that I got my bit coins this morning.
TL;DR; Had a successful Level 1 purchase of 5 BTC this week despite rising prices.

No one knows exactly how to value the Bitcoin market because it is so new. Unlike the stocks of public companies, you can't use traditional methods like earnings or revenue multiples.
What we do know is that as Bitcoin becomes more used and wanted the price will go up. Supply and demand and all that. So definitely as more people buy thinking the price will go up, the price goes up. Typical speculator stuff, and if the speculators cash out there will be a crash.
But Bitcoin has more value outside being a vehicle for speculation.
The way I think about it currently is that Bitcoin (or any currency really) can be used for 3 things:
1. to store value
2. to exchange for stuff
3. to exchange for other money
You can think of the Bitcoins being used daily for 1, 2, and 3 as bunch of bits travelling through a series of tubes. The tube (total Bitcoin market cap) has to be large enough to support the amount of 1, 2, and 3 that is being demanded.
So if people with some extra cash to save (say a bunch of wealthy Chinese) want to store $5B USD worth of cash, the Bitcoin market cap has to be at least $5B USD, preferably higher for better liquidity. Additionally, if there are over $5B of "sales" being done in Bitcoin each day or few days, we want to have another $5B worth of Bitcoin to do it with. And if we are transferring money to our families, businesses, and charities totally up to $5B every few days, we need another $5B of market cap. Assuming all of this, a $15B market cap or about where the price is now makes sense.
So IMO, as these uses go up, the tube will have to grow, and the price of a single Bitcoin will have to go up.
Think about what would happen if the tube were small. Suppose Bitcoins were once again $100. This equates to a $1.5B market cap or so. If all of a sudden Warren Buffet wanted to store $1.5B of his USD in Bitcoin, he effectively wouldn't be able to. He'd have to buy EVERY Bitcoin to do so. Because of this, the price of Bitcoin would rise to meet his demand.
That's a silly case, but collectively we are all demanding about $15B USD worth of Bitcoins for the various things we want to do with it. A lot of us just want to store them away, which is okay. As long as there is a healthy amount of uses 2 and 3 now and in the future, we'll be okay.

Yeah, I think he was focusing on BitCoin's anti-inflationary properties as it's considered a kind of replacement for the gold standard by goldbugs, etc. But he would probably be more interested in the other aspects of BitCoin (frictionless, anonymous transactions) if he spent more time thinking about it. Maybe he will now that the price of BitCoins is surging and mainstream media is starting to talk about it more.
@_date: 2013-04-15 14:24:00
I think that Krugman is slamming bitcoin where it needs to be slammed: the idea that inflation is inherently bad, the idea that Governments backing money is inherently bad, the idea that going back to a gold standard would be good. These are ideas built into bitcoin or associated with it that need to be criticized.
Further, I think Krugman is mostly considering the question "is bitcoin better than the US dollar and US Federal Reserve system" and coming to the conclusion that bitcoin is not in fact better than the system we got. I'd agree with him.
However, that doesn't mean that bitcoin is worthless. I think Krugman is ignoring the value and possibilities of bitcoin, especially with regard to how seamless digital commerce can be with it. I think mostly, this is due to the context of his articles and interviews where, like I said, he is comparing bitcoin to the US system in the context of the world economy, instead of considering if bitcoin is valuable on its own. 
I get the feeling that if Krugman knew more about the technology behind bitcoin he would be more excited about that and some of the ways bitcoin can coexist in the world economy. At some point he might dig into that, but he's probably more likely to focus on the political ideas around bitcoin since that is where he spends most of his time thinking and writing.

Deflation leads to less spending not no spending at all.
Buying on credit is especially dangerous with deflation going on. Imagine if you took out a 20k bitcoin loan last fall to buy a house. You now have a 20k loan for a house that is worth 2k bitcoin. In USD, you have a $2,000,000 loan for a $200,000 house.

RE the chargeback and other buyer protections, I think you are right that it doesn't make sense for some consumers buying some products. And if there ever is a Bitpay like company (or them themselves) that offer Bitcoin payments with fraud protection, chargebacks, insurance, rewards, etc.... the fees would end up being close to typical credit card fees anyway.
However, not all businesses or transactions require all of that protection. If you are sending money to your grandmother, you don't need to pay extra for insurance against her not delivering love to you or something. You might similarly might sell something where that kind of insurance isn't needed (digital products?) and Bitcoin offers a cheaper alternative. Or if you discount prices 1-2% for using Bitcoin, your consumers are able to decide if the insurance is worth it or not.

A 1% conversion rate is fairly standard for untargeted traffic on an ecommerce site. And more payment options (almost) always increases conversions, but I think your case (selling bitcoin-related products) an only-bitcoin checkout has less downside than usual and is kind of appropriate.
Anyway, I'm only chiming in because I've seen many ecommerce merchants focus on increasing conversion rates instead of increasing total visitors. Focus on visitor growth until you feel like that is exhausted or a jump from 1% conversions to 1.5% conversions would make a noticeable difference in your revenue (i.e. you're already making a shit-ton of money).
Good luck.

Can you explain what you mean by time being important?
I suppose what I meant was that people are less likely to purchase things with coins if those coins are likely to go up in value. When the fed wants people to save less cash and spend more they lower interest rates. There is no similar way to force people to spend coins over saving them.
Another related issue is that loans in Bitcoin are risky. If you mortgage 200 Bitcoins to buy a house and then Bitcoins raise to $1500/coin vs $1000/coin, you'r now on the hook for $300k USD instead of the original $200k USD. This means that buying things on credit/etc is tough with Bitcoin.

One analogy I use is that the Bitcoin "pipe" has to have enough value to support all the transactions demanded by it at any given moment, whether or not people cash in or cash out.
So for example, if Bill Gates wanted to send $5B USD to the Gates foundation using BTC for the transfer, the total market value of BTC would have to be at least $5B so he could buy them all and then sell them all again.
Of course, if you tried to buy every Bitcoin at once, the price would go up, so you need a higher market value to stay "liquid", i.e. able to make these transactions without adjusting the price.
Now replace Bill Gate's $5B transfer with a bunch of smaller transfers adding up to $5B. It's the same principle.

In a market, speculators provide liquidity. It's good to have people holding Bitcoin who are willing to sell them when the price goes up and buy them when the price goes down. This makes it more likely for there to be a buyer/seller when you want to buy/sell coins for non-speculative reasons.
Similar situations and conversations come up in things like oil futures. Again, you can only guess at the specific impact of speculation, but this article guesses that something like 90% of the activity in the oil futures is speculation, which accounts for about 40% of the price of oil. 
When prices are relatively stable, speculators keep it more stable. When prices are running up (like in Bitcoin now) speculators make the price run faster. And when prices crash (if bad news comes out or people generally lose confidence in Bitcoin) speculators make the price crash faster.

Bitcoins (and gold) are deflationary because there is no mechanism to increase the supply of bitcoins.
And even though bitcoins don't generally disappear, the supply can be _decreased_ by people stashing them away and effectively taking them out of the market.
When this happens in the US system, the Fed "prints money" to increase the supply combat the deflation. There is no similar way to combat deflation in bitcoins.
You can read the Krugman article linked above for some examples of why deflation is bad.
@_date: 2013-12-30 21:46:26
I have the same concerns. The case is still open for me. 
I have a feeling that people with a lot of money in Bitcoin won't let the value drop. If a Bitcoin alternative comes around, I think it will live alongside of Bitcoin since the network is there and it should be easy enough to convert BTC to altcoins on demand as needed.
Krugman believes that Bitcoin won't work well as a currency for buying things, etc. I agree. Pricing things in BTC irrespective of currency exchange rates is insane now. It will get more sane as the Bitcoin matures but will always have too much risk. However, I think it will still have value as a storing and transferring value if not for buying things. I optimistic about the technology in general.
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:38:26
I like this line of thinking. RE the comparison to Western Union-style money changers I think it makes more sense to compare the amount of money transferred through these services vs. their market cap as a business. The Bitcoin "tube" needs to be big enough to handle the demand of  money transfer. So instead of looking at Western Union's $9B market cap, you should look at the [$79B they transfer each year](
Of course those payments don't all happen at once, so the Bitcoin tube would only have to be some % of that size to handle that much movement. Not sure what the appropriate % would need to be, but enough that Bitcoin could handle the transfers in a liquid manner.

This is where it gets interesting. I'm not an accountant and in any way qualified to answer this, but I'll try.
My understanding is that any purchase in bitcoin would be a taxable event if it was using capital gains.
So say you held the bitcoins for over 1 year and so are subject to the more favorable capital gains tax rate of 15%.
If you "buy" US dollars using bitcoin, we agree you would have to pay 15% on the earnings.
If you buy something that is no US dollars, but has a value in US dollars, you would still have to pay 15% on the earnings. So say you bought a $10k car, you'd have to pay $1.5k in taxes.
Similar cases would be people having to pay taxes on the cars that Oprah bought them, or people paying taxes on forgiven home loan debt, or Apple having to pay taxes on foreign money being spent, or people with successful currency trades paying taxes on purchases made in the foreign currency instead of converting it to US dollars.

Yeah. The thing is if you have a bundle of gold sitting around, it doesn't magically create more gold over the years. One pound of gold is still one pound of gold.
However, if you have a bundle of cash sitting around in a bank it does (kind of) magically create more cash through interest.
So even though $1 is worth 10% what it used to be, you have 70x as much money if you invested it in bonds.
The year is 1928. Gold is $20.66 per ounce. Which would you rather have one pound of gold, $330.56 in 10-year treasury bonds, or $330.56 of S&amp;P500 stock?
Historic Prices of Gold: 
Historic Bond and Stock Returns: 
Gold is now $1578 per ounce or $25,248 per pound. Nice return. Gold rules!
$330.56 in 1928 invested and reinvested in 10 year treasuries would be worth $22,886. Not as good as gold, but a hell of a lot more than $330.56... and not as risky as gold either. In 2000, gold at $279/ounce = $4464 per pound. Meanwhile, your bonds were worth $11,227.

I imagine this would be considered "realizing a gain" since gift cards are as good as cash. You are supposed to declare gift cards as income if they are gifted to you or you get them with credit card rewards, etc. This would be very similar.
In general, don't try to sneak your way out of the taxes. If you've made money (and you've "cashed out" in some sense) pay tax on your gains.

It's only a gain if ~~it gains in value~~ you make a profit. If you buy a new car and drive it off the lot it's immediately worth less. When you eventually sell the car (at a price less than you bought it for) you won't have to pay any taxes. However, if you buy a classic car and fix it up and then sell it for more than you bought it for, you'll need to pay taxes on the profit you made.
If you hold stock or bitcoins or a classic car the value may be higher "on paper" (in the market), but it's not a "realized gain" or loss until you convert your purchase back into USD or a USD equivalent.
That's a simplification of things. I'm not an accountant.

So I wanted to make sure we were talking about the same thing: less spending vs. no spending.
Assuming rational actors, it makes logical sense for people to spend less. But if you want "evidence", I suppose the great depression is pretty good evidence.
And you're right about consumption equaling production. If consumption goes down, so does production, and so consumption goes down. You might assume prices go up cause supply of products goes down... but a fall in production means a fall in labor and wages as well. And THAT pushes prices down.
That's the spiral for you.
If you want to look at the math, Krugman has that (found this via Wikipedia on Deflation, Deflationary Spiral):
I don't really understand what we are debating here anymore. If you have a currency that can deflate but can't inflate (by design), it has a deflationary bias. And are we then questioning whether deflation is a bad thing or not? I suppose read all the articles and papers and stuff and make up your own mind.
Economics includes a lot of math, but it is a social science at heart, so it's impossible to prove that anything is infallibly true. You just need to make your own judgement about how much to believe anyone's outcome or theories.

Besides your specific issue with PayPal, I think Krugman was stating something like "How's it different from PayPal" and then went on to state how it's different from PayPal.
Because his readers might be thinking that.

Good points.

As long as you are more concerned with actually buying things vs just keeping score, you should be more worried about price inflation than monetary inflation.
