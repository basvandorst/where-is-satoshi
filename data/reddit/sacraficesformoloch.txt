Not even the same thing.  The supply of bitcoin being mined is going to be reduced in 2020, 2024, 2028, 2032..... If the hashrate continutes to grow and the demand remains steady (this is the most neutral option) The price of 1btc relative to fiat will have no choice but to have increased.  A lot of things can happen in this space though no guarantees.  I see the growing hashrate and know the halving is coming whatever the average production value of a bitcoin is definitely a great buy signal assuming nothing else changes.

Funny thing about bitcoin is that if it truly takes off and changes the world .01 is really all you need.  That's like what a $70 short-term (2020 halving) and long-term bet (2032 1.5btc mined a block)

What I said is true with all commodities which has created many bubbles in history.  Anyways sounds like you are with your wannabe insults.  I don’t do a good job explaining, and for that I am sorry. 1. I am not talking weekly or monthly fluctuations but a decade over the next four halving.  Bitcoin has only seen two so far resulting in price bubbles. 2. You have three main economic points to keep in mind. 






With bitcoin being deflationary and if demand only ever stayed the same with a growing or relative stable Hashing power, the price to produce 1 bitcoin will increase over the next decade.   With increased hashing power and another demand cycle you will see prices sky rocket �� once again.  If demand is reduced and hashing power lowers you may still see prices increase just do to the deflationary nature or they can stagnate which still serves of the purpose of store of value and medium of exchange.  
The Bitcoin Standard does a really good job explaining this.  I recommend you pick that book up.  Commodities can eventually meet demand bitcoin at some Point in the future may not with only ever being 20.999999mil bitcoins in existence and less and less mined every 10 minutes.
