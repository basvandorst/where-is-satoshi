@_date: 2017-12-08 01:58:59

@_date: 2017-12-14 19:43:12

more like the founding fathers club. If we don't use btc, it won't spread
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:39:14
Not long ago it was easy to get one bitcoin in the faucets, now people dream about what's it like to earn one bitcoin. It has begun...
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:33:47
give it a few more years and that's a $100,000 coffee
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:39:11
This is the dream. To use internet money on virtually anything in real.
@_date: 2018-06-08 11:00:40
This reminds myself that dollars are easily printed while Bitcoin number is fixed. Dollars value in the upcoming future can only go down. 
 
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:51:17
the transaction fee is outrageous high, in-exchange for the convenience they bring to the table
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:16:47
My cryptos are not going back to fiat. I am waiting for cryptocurrency to be mainstream.
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:11:23
I'm not holding forever, just until btc is not being compared to $$ and is mainstream ly used. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:09:00
no such thing. bitcoin is your own personal bank and you can revert your bitcoin back to dollar whenever you wishes
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:01:17
It's only worth mining if you have free electricity. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:48:13
i like this narrative 
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:16:58
celebrate from your bed
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:53:50
what dumb reason? don't invest, just treat it as a savings account like you would in a bank, you can always convert the bitcoin back to dollar whenever
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:03:50
dont worry bud, 9k is not where the train stop, it'll go all the way to moon. So 3k difference is miniscule
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:31:20
Past is past, just treat bitcoin like you would with a savings account in a bank. Someday, we all don't have to return to dollar because the cryptocurrency will be mainstream.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:50:12
Maybe don't think of bitcoin as investment, but rather as a savings account. Dollar's value is always decreasing, meanwhile bitcoin's value is always increasing, so where would you like to store your hard earned money?
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:18:02
people use btc all the time, and then they buy some more
@_date: 2019-04-11 23:45:45
he's probably still developing bitcoin in secret
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:06:22

@_date: 2017-09-13 23:52:14
I am not losing money. Dollar devalue itself every time I get up in bed.

welcome to our universe, mr/ms. time-traveler-san
@_date: 2017-09-04 00:42:31
High fees, but meh, its convenient enough to get bitcoins before mass adoption.
@_date: 2017-09-01 01:44:35
This is what I do too.
@_date: 2017-09-04 01:59:58
I buy from coinbase and save my private key and wallet.dat
