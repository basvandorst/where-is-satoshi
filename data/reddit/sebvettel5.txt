Spreading fake news like you’re doing on reddit right now?
@_date: 2018-01-04 12:39:47
Sold mine 5 months ago when the difficulty was around 7.somethingsomething.
It's going to become an expensive door stop pretty soon, unless electricity is almost, if not - free, for you, pretty soon.

I have a 5BTC buy order at 8k, fingers crossed :D
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:49:28
Haha yeah, it's locked behind a 2-step lock tho. BTW, you from SA?
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:52:03
Yup. And if this Asian dump continues, the weak hands in Europe and the USA and those who try to time the market to make some btc profit will be selling further when they wake up soon.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:29:47
I said it in another post but i'll say it again. We've figured 10k is coming before the new year.

I wrote lyrics to a fake song with each new line's word being my seed. It's uploaded to YouTube as a private video, with me playing guitar. Very inconspicuous.
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:35:31
Your post history asking for price prediction says you might be in the wrong game as a day trader.

Depends how sneaky the Asian market is today. 
This is speculation but a possible scenario: They could’ve planned a huge dump the day before Xmas. Next week - when the western world needs cash, more will be cashing out to fiat, having overspent over Xmas, possibly needing cashing going into the new year. Bulk selling (from Asia) and selling here and there (western world) could very well bring us to 10k again.
Edit: typo
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:55:22
Another dip expected today (Saturday) so they’ll be okay.
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:32:03
Nice man. Yeah my song has been up for about 17 months now. 1 view on the video - me after it was uploaded... hehe :D. Hope your kids still remember the song!

I’m in the same discord group as the CTO and CFO of an exchange in my country. I lurk but absorb all their chatter with their community

You get the exact amount of coin you have at the exact time of the split. Not prior, not post.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:38:38
Nah, just hitting the floor at 10k. HODL, day trade - whatever you do, just don't worry about it. It'll pass and hit 20k in Jan. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:04:32
Fk yeah!!
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:03:04
I see 10k coming before the new year. HODLers will celebrate. The brave will make money. Either way - a lot of us win.

Again? You mean the 5th sale this season? You’re justifying panicking about the price drop with “Sale”. GTFO
@_date: 2017-08-16 13:33:55
Yeah, for buying.. it's absolutely fine. As soon as I buy I transfer off to my Trezor though, just in case something happens to Luno. But for exchanging, keeping anything less than 2 BTC on there is okay, for me at least, it's minimal loss. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 19:23:45
Breadwallet on iOS is good, any paper wallet is better, any hardware wallet is the best :)
As I said, for large amounts only. So if for example 10,000 is not that much for you, keep 10k on Luno. If R500 is not that much to you, keep it on Luno too. That way you can withdraw trivial amounts if you run out of cash or whatever that our country is sucking us dry from :). What I’m saying is, keep emergency money or exchange money on Luno, keep the rest safe somewhere else.
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:27:44
Yeah been following chatter on some private Discord servers (away from the BCH crew). Seems that it may touch $6800 this weekend before flying up next week. But hey, I have 2 balls and neither are them are crystal, so....
@_date: 2017-11-09 06:42:15
We're really welcoming to new people wanting to get into BTC. Well done.
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:16:40


@_date: 2017-11-13 11:40:02
This dude likely sold at the BTC low point a few days ago and needs it to go lower, but it ain't happening. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:41:21
Well it's gone up +$200 approx in the past 3 hours. Seems to be steady. Those here that sold hoping to buy cheaper are likely biting their nails now. But hey, who knows. Someone on another thread said it might correct, but absolutely not below $7,000.
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:03:04
So we have to stoop to their level to "get back" at them? Ignore it. They'll tire out and will go away.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:41:30
I've always found this funny, that we have to ask Mods to do these things. We're all holding/trading this decentralized currency, hoping for a decentralized world, yet everything we talk about here is moderated and controlled, and we allow it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:01:01
So never spend? Is that how you expect this currency to take off?
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:45:54
BCC 1337? Yeah, that's the max amount of people that'll ever use it.

This screenshot was taken today, the iMessage UI clearly shows “Today” with the time. I doubt the last time he spoke to his “Babe ��” was the last time btc dropped under 4k, or alternatively, BTC definitely did not drop below 4K today. Get lost OP
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:52:45
I thought about that but just wondered if that was a screenshot worthy conversation on that very day. Maybe. If he did I’ll apologize to OP.
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:13:48
Jokes on you, I made 0.9 btc. (10.71 to 11.64) by playin it right.

Lets first checkout the SegWit2x situation. But I hope so!

Just another friendly reminder to avoid these 100% scam sites in South Africa:


@_date: 2018-02-05 09:52:32
Brah. "Purchase Bitcoin at affordable rates and see your investments grow". Right on your home page. So I give you R100k right now, BTC drops a couple hundred bucks for a month or so, is my investment growing? C'mon, not even Luno or Ice3x dare to write such comments on their pages.
@_date: 2018-02-23 08:31:49
Trading bitcoin in South Africa in person? With the murder rate here, I’d sooner cut my own throat or stab myself instead.
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:37:24
Owner Jacques is a scam artist, I know him well. Would be better to avoid - message to my fellow SA'cans
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:12:04
False advertising. Explain your product in a way that your grandma can understand it. If she reads that EXACT line on your front page, her expectation would be that she will make money. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 08:20:58
Sigh. Saffers - avoid these scam sites please. Stick to Luno and Ice3x. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 10:44:27
Oh fuck off with these guesses. Unless you've LITERALLY time travelled, no-one has any idea what the price will be in the next minute, hour, day or even week.
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:35:26
Don't use it. Jacques will rip you off with his second hand hardware.
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:02:35
Yeah, shady. I'd avoid and stick with Luno.
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:40:04


Yeah no, Andrew - dit is nie n' lekker statement ou pal. Technically, investments in crypto in general might not grow.

Check out Nicehash, you can buy power there. I do and throw all my power toward Kanopool. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 22:31:45
I have an S9 and it's great. For me - who pays for electricity - it just made more sense over the S5 or the S7.

right now my one antminer is doing okay. 1 week out of the month im mining just to cover it's electricity costs (i have a high rate). but to be honest, with the difficulty going up, S9's are becoming less profitable... so you need an army of them just to keep up. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 22:41:27
Around $572 per month (gross), less electricity costs of $148. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 18:26:06
Thanks! Appreciate it...
@_date: 2017-06-22 18:26:14
Thanks man.
@_date: 2017-06-22 22:20:46
As a Nicehash seller of Antminer S9 power, this is true. I make more money renting my power at Nicehash than I do in the same period at Slush or Antpool. BTW, I've also made some profit buying power at Nicehash when I got very lucky with some pools.. it's all down to luck. I wouldn't slam Nicehash as quick as you did.
@_date: 2017-06-21 08:15:21
I use it in South Africa - they're solid.
