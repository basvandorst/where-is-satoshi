So it's safe to say you haven't watched your 40% loss turn into a %1000 gain multiple times over
@_date: 2018-01-14 18:47:53
Like a few months, yeah it's rough
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:18:34
Go ahead, but that's a terrible idea. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 19:58:32
Still gotta type the code in to send a transaction. 
Ledger encrypts all that hardware side
@_date: 2018-01-15 06:00:34
~~Wow you're a salty one. Do they really ban for that?~~
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:22:03
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:56:55
I mean having to type the code in to access your crypto. 
Anytime you want to make a transaction it creates an attack vector. Keylogger/virus, mitm if it's a web wallet, whatever. 
If all you're doing is receiving and HODLing, then stick to pen and paper or scrambled Gmail I guess. I don't know how well like an unscrambler might work would be my only concern there 
@_date: 2018-01-14 18:43:30
Typing or copying and pasting a private key into your computer is always risky because your key is basically your money. Possible keyloggers/viruses get ahold of it, you lose it. No recovery possible
A hardware wallet never lets your unencrypted key touch a computer. You physically PIN each transaction out. Not unbreakable but certainly a few steps up from saving your key in notepad (which you should never never do)
I don't have any good resources in hand, but Google how to store crypto and you'll find a ton. Ledger Nano S is a good hardware wallet, only buy from official site
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:00:44
Which exchange is LMAO pls quick
@_date: 2018-01-14 18:39:42
No it isn't. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 19:10:06
Bitcoin is honestly a bad investment as it stands right now. Proof of work they use is outdated, it's got a high environmental impact and poor scalability. 
Cryptocurrency on the other hand is a pretty wildly important development. Self managing finances, out of banker control, *very* difficult to tamper with asset registrations, public or private transfers as needed, distributed computing, cheap/free and relatively instant value transfers (with tangle based or newer blockchain based), automated multisignature holdings, etc
It's a work in progress but the goal isn't that out of reach. We're all speculators as the tech matures, but it is maturing fast 
@_date: 2018-01-15 06:26:08
~~Unsound shitcoins? Yikes~~
~~I honestly didn't realize which sub I was on, but that kind of attitude damn~~
Long live only Bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-01-14 19:26:26
Offline signing and wallet generating is definitely a step up. Lots of people recommend an airgapped (never been online never will be online) computer for that if you have one 
That said, many people do rely on a virus scanner and a web wallet and many never get robbed. It's about how much you're putting in, how safe you need to feel with it
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:37:45


@_date: 2017-12-26 21:00:19
Actually yeah. It's still possible though difficult to fix. Bankers are beyond any of our reach
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:30:18
Oh, no sorry, I'm intentionally invalidating self aggrandization and pomposity
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:24:25
We've all been that guy

Not trust less, but WeTrust is a blockchain lending circle

Not me, too busy catching falling alt knives
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:39:49
Some coin trying to take over ETH market with lots of advertising
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:29:30
Richard, if you'd of been honest in the first place we wouldn't have needed a divorce
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:43:55
It's one of like 7 forks this month. Pretty sure people will see past it as a money grab, but it's like having a bunch of knockoffs of your product everywhere. 
Like yeah, sign of success, but just tacky. Don't think anyones actually upset about it
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:49:00
Is this a copypasta 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:41:48
Wtf it's terrible. It'll take days of zero new transactions to clear. Fees and transaction times are obscene. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:35:32

@_date: 2017-08-17 00:16:40
Or buy a real crypto and watch that $4 turn into $30 like a real risk taking trader. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:54:16
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:24:18
Make a clear argument please. 
The region may have been poor, but the plantation owners were in another league of wealth compared to the average person
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:44:42
But if the coin isn't necessary why will its price rise 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:29:17
It's just 1 year 3 times chill
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:31:43
Not anymore no. So many fines
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:39:14
Are you drunk?
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:07:32
You said it wasn't profitable. 
It was. I'm not getting sucked into any backwoods logic here, peace out. You aren't even addressing what I said
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:35:16
I had an 11$ fee on like 80$ which took multiple days. 
Literally useless as a currency at these timescales and rates. Value store sure, as currency it's definitely not functional. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:30:27
Hey it worked for Al Capone right
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:38:37
Too edgy for me fam. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:55:54
Fair points
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:46:11
That's a pretty extreme label imo, but I suppose I'm just used to it. Here we just call it sanity. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:16:27
What? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:36:29
As a Canadian I wouldn't call us socialist. 
We just have functioning healthcare 
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:30:25
You joking yeah? It's easy as fuck unless you're trying to move a few hundred k+ in a short period of time, and even then it's doable
@_date: 2017-11-01 06:27:25
I was like that till i went 8x on my pocket change. 
It gets addictive. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:13:09
My bet, and you can ignore it if you like, but IOTA is probably gunna jump some more. Otherwise Litecoin is probably a safe bet for short to mid term
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:48:48
Larger blocks need more memory, focuses processing power in fewer hands. 
2mb, sure whatever's it's manageable. But you keep giving inches and suddenly there a guy out there with 51% of the power and the whole system goes catastrophic. 
The whole point here is decentralization, fees, wait times. There's a balance that needs to be struck and increasing block sizes regularly is the wrong direction as far as I understand it. 
Do you have an alternate view? I'm still learning as well
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:35:18
Try life instead though
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:08:10
How did all the plantation owners get so rich then
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:28:23
You woulda sold at a couple hundred like everyone else, don't stress
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:42:10
Is this approach working in your life? Just keep nitpicking and avoiding any mistake you make instead of either backing it up or admitting your mistake? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:20:19
Holy shit dude you're spiralling. 
Facts. Use facts. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:25:20
That has very little to do with what I said fam
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:08:34
Some police stations have monitored transfer areas too for online selling
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:06:58
Yeah but now he could buy heroin deluxe lmao. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:06:13
If you still got 100+ coins you're nearly a millionaire already fam, you're doing alright
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:07:45
" and I brought you some Bitcoin"
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:27:38
You're saying to buy at the bottom and sell at the absolute top
That's fucking genius thanks for the idea
@_date: 2018-03-19 15:48:27
It's also still up 800% since this time last year 
@_date: 2018-03-22 00:08:32
@_date: 2018-03-19 16:21:13
**Yes it is**
People laughing its down 5/20/60 % this month, but 
You put in 1000 last year, they laugh. It goes up to 20000, they cry, it drops to 8000, they laugh and somehow think they were the smart ones 
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:56:33


FTFY. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:29:51
It's an old inefficient tech that's barely being patched enough to tread water 
Come on. Everybody knows that here. Other tech is better, BTC just has first mover advantage and name recognition. 
I mean ffs, Rai is free and instant. Monero is comparatively untraceable, ETH is faster, cheaper, and capable of SC's. 
Name one verifiable way that BTC excels in a technical manner. I'm genuinely curious 
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:07:43
If I crossed the road with my eyes closed and survive, I'm still an idiot. So was this guy
I mean, I make risky af investments, but no way I'd take a loan like this and let it ride on btc
@_date: 2018-02-07 04:58:10
Gibraltar exchange is aiming to solve that problem tbh. I mean yes, US please also do so, but it's not a void area
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:44:59
I'd call it fuck off money personally 
@_date: 2017-09-10 21:14:50
Cause it wouldn't have been worth anything. 
Nowhere would accept it without some first accepting it, money is pretty worthless if it can't ever be spent
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:18:53
So it'd be more accurate to say he earned the money for his house with Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-14 05:17:07
Idk that's overcomplicate things imo. I have no bit to tip but if you just add it on the end of your comment you'll probably better the odds
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:15:58
By excuses do you mean basic multiplicative math
Cause I'd call it 700% profit lmao 
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:33:37
Damn you kinda salty. 
I like how people called the internet a bubble too. Like it was, but it's also prevalent in nearly every sector now. 
Besides if you pick the winners it ain't a bubble, it's a sound investment /s
@_date: 2017-09-05 04:35:05
I did exactly this. 
But I bought NEO  $7. Went to 60, now it's at 20ish 
Don't be afraid to put like 20% of that Bitcoin into some Altcoins like OMG, ARK, or ETH or whatever. Risks are higher but so are the payouts. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 04:28:36
**I'm** not Satoshi Nakamoto either
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:35:22
But according to McAfee we got another 10x boost coming someday
@_date: 2017-10-12 06:03:18
Not hot dog?
@_date: 2017-10-14 04:42:36
Just put your public key at the end of the story, is that not allowed?
@_date: 2017-10-11 04:32:05
The community donated like 40 BTC to him after the media ruined his life. He's chill with Bitcoin now
@_date: 2017-09-05 04:38:11
Depends where you live. I'm in Canada so no coinbase for me (they let you buy i think but not cash out) 
There are vending machine that charge 5-15% or other sites depending on your locale. Don't keep it on the exchange though, find a solid desktop or paper wallet to store your funds (Google and this subreddit can help ya there)
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:30:23
It takes like half an hour to figure out wtf
@_date: 2018-04-12 18:43:31
If you think the firewall is that perfect you're out of the loop
I didn't say it was an all powerful form of protection or anything, but it is way better than a paper sign, full stop. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 12:45:41
Lmao 
@_date: 2018-04-12 18:53:05
What the government wants is for people not to get out of the country and to maintain control over their friends and family
Its a risk but it's not a stupid one, they want more freedom. They want to keep trying, that's a lot better than giving up just because it's failed before.
 Do you always give up on the first try for something important? 
@_date: 2018-04-12 16:21:44
I mean it does allow instantaneous communication and recording sharing, it'll do a little better than paper signs 
@_date: 2018-04-12 16:13:56
You're joking right?
Whole market is still up almost 10x from this time last year lmao
@_date: 2018-04-06 20:04:50
I mean the whole point of crypto is you have complete control of your money isn't it
If he'd of had and kept backups properly this would be a non issue if I understand correctly 
@_date: 2018-04-15 03:25:47
Then they just look like good weather fans
@_date: 2018-04-12 19:17:15
Oh awesome. If you know the other ways please inform the people of China asap I'm sure they'd actually love an alternative
Cause otherwise all they can do is increase international pressure with scenes like this. Which as you note, is not very effective  
@_date: 2017-07-31 00:09:03
On ANS it wiiiilllll
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:32:21
@_date: 2017-06-28 19:34:44
Does anything? 
I mean yeah, if you're actually trying to communicate then a point is necessary.
@_date: 2017-06-28 19:27:46
One may also argue all organized matter is an error, and entropy is the true state of the universe. 
What's your point?
