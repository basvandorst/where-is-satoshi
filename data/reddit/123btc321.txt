All competing digital currencies will falter the minute there is a gateway from digital currency &lt;-&gt; bitcoin, as it will be preferable to hold the open source, universally accepted token vs. the limited, proprietary technology.

Proof of work never existed before, but this is only necessary if you have a public database you want to update with signed messages. A private database is controlled and entries can be entered by specific entities. 
A public database requires some sort of reward token otherwise no one has economic incentive to run the machines that do the proof of work. (Or if disrupting the network is their economic incentive then it becomes to trivial to overcome the 'volunteer' network)
The benefits the banks see is that they can have their own bitcoin address associated with Intrabank transfers reducing any costs associated with traditional processing networks closer to zero.

Interesting data, why does the block size stop at 9GB? For reference I have 100Mbps internet now so I can only imagine what I would have in 2039. 
Also I think people are downplaying the economic forces that influence technology development. As it stands right now our computer systems (ram, storage, network) are more than adequate for running average tasks today and into the next 5 years. However as demand grows for both cloud based systems in developed and developing nations we might see an increase in the raw power of computing systems in terms for ram, storage and network.

If Santander put a 1 terahash miner in every branch they would have less than half the hashing power of the bitcoin network (145,000,000 vs 330,000,000 gigahashes) and spend over $8 million a day in energy expenses. (Assuming they are getting $.10/kWh

Yes, but $20 a month. If 1 btc ever hits a $million each .1 BTC will be worth $100,000. Bitcoin is an interesting comp sci project, interesting financial project, and a great way to store wealth (super secure)
The transition from fiat to digital currencies will take time, and it will happen faster and faster as more and more people pile on. Anyone who holds ONLY fiat will lose substantial wealth. People who own stocks, real estate, hard assets, collectibles, etc. will not see much of a decrease in wealth as those things can be valued in multiple different currencies at any time. A shock to the economy as it attempts to reorganize can temporarily cause some devaluation but you won't find a 2015 Corvette for free anywhere. It might cost $100.000.000 USD but only .05 bitcoin. This also hinges on if bitcoin can be scaled to encompass the world economy, which we are still unsure about. Regardless bitcoin (or some derivative) is the way forward, and learning to use these systems NOW will only be to your advantage.

Does Greece leaving the EU have any effect on the Euro? Who will pick up the tab for debt that Greece has agreed to pay? Sounds like the other countries in Europe will need to pay more to clear Greece's debt, more debt load means less growth, which means a currency that is worth less. (eg: I can get more units/piece of paper in America, so ill invest there) This also assumes that the debts Greece has to pay don't cause other banks/countries to default on their own obligation causing the often talked about domino effect. When no one can afford to pay their bills, and credit markets go crazy, those people in control of financial assets will probably position themselves into the most liquid asset (so they can buy low when shit sorts out), which may not be the Euro as everyone is dumping it for Dollars.

I doubt the people in charge are aware that some people choose to not subscribe to their system of compliance. They are at the top, they meet with important business people and politicians which means the last thing on their mind is why Joe Blow from Middle America is pissed because the bank shutdown his account for a possibly 'illegal' transaction. Their minds' are on sustaining the system around them, because why kill the goose that laid the golden egg, and this bitcoin stuff is so different from any existing system that it is hard to understand (even for the tech savvy).
Do the institutions have an alternative solution to letting the people transact how they wish? I doubt it, there is a vested interest in controlling the money supply. (ref: Rothschild) And I am not talking conspiracy theory, someone should do a white paper on manipulating traditional fiat economic systems while controlling the money supply.
You are right, for the most part people don't care about decentralization, but they do just want things to work. If fiat currencies continue to fail them economically through inflation, theft, or over indebtedness then there might be incentive to try out other systems (bitcoin). Regardless of the general populace, banks are starting to see the light and when they embrace bitcoin it will just be 1 step further into legitimizing it's usage.

One theory I think we should analyze is the claims that mining hardware will become a commodity one day and this will help to redistribute mining power. Right now many miners are utilizing hardware that is expensive to develop and with short production runs we are not experiencing the same economies of scale that other chips benefit from (think memory and cpu). If we one day have companies like Intel, AMD or even the ARM model competing on efficiency and hashing power we will have a better product, available to everyone. Will this help to redistribute hashing power? What will this do to bitcoin mining value?

IIRC correctly the manipulations are usually the companies front running customer orders so they can make a profit off their customers loss. So by not doing business with them you are not subjecting yourself to their manipulations. With bitcoin being a distributed system you would need to collude with hundreds, thousands, possibly millions of other traders in order to rig market buy and sell orders in your favor. In the case of FOREX it only seems to be a handful of companies.

I use it online as it is quicker and safer than giving out my credit card # (which has been stolen quite a few times in the past year). The banks will never tell you the responsible party so instead of guessing who not to patronize, I just use bitcoin.
Also there are some nice deals to be had. If you are a coffee drinker then  will get you 20% off on Starbucks.
There are many ancillary benefits that many people don't care to think about. 
* More efficient to use the bitcoin network for value transfer than the existing banking network (saves trees)
* Faster for merchants to receive funds (on average they receive payment in 10 minute and can respend vs. 4 days if you make the transaction on Friday at 5:01PM)
* Cheap, if the merchant pays all his suppliers and employees in bitcoin then there is no exchange rate fees to accept bitcoin. If the merchant needs to utilize USD then there is fees between 0%-1% (vs. 2%-3%) depending on the exchange processor. Your favorite merchants gets to keep more of their money vs paying middlemen.
* Bitcoin will become more popular in the coming years, many services and industries can benefit from utilizing the technologies that make bitcoin. Knowing how it works and how to use it is setting me up for a job market that will be charged with replacing the current financial system, while also expanding it out to regions that have NO banking system.
There is more, gotta get back to work.

In general price gouging is seen as a 'bad' thing, when in a completely free market it has the effect of diverting resources to needed areas. (Why sell these bottles for $1 over the course of months, when I can sell them all in 2 days @ $5 a bottle.) Obviously with limited resources coming from the area the gouging can be somewhat detrimental, but with outside financial assistance being 'dropped' right into the hands of the people (mass bitcoin donations, or airdropping $100 USD bills or some such) then the costs of gouging can be offset, giving merchants the incentive to deliver gouged goods, giving the people the resources they need in the short and long term.
I think in general top down responses are far less effective than individuals seeking individual solutions to their problems. Hurricane Katrina (and just about any other disaster managed by FEMA) has a less than desirable outcome, I understand the logistical and manpower issues for such organizations, but that can be overcome by allowing people to do what they do best, which is usually whatever is best for them.
To add, without the effects of price gouging, there no incentive to move supplies, and move them now into areas that need them. Sure there might be an agreement, and some people moving goods, but it is not at a pace that nets the first to market the most profit.

I am always a bit leery of centralized services, no matter how 'great' their blockchain is (a.k.a. regular database). Unless it is geographically distributed against absolute failure and cryptographically verified, it's nothing special. What are the costs to maintain vaults as the platform grows? Certainly it is not as efficient as storing 5 pieces of paper in geographically distributed areas. Regardless this type of gold service has been dreamed about in years past and it will be embraced, but something better has come of age, Bitcoin. (Most just don't realize it yet)

Without Central Banking the economy does not get too far out of whack requiring 'Great' depressions to bring expectation back in line with reality. The depressions of the 19th century that brought about central banking in the 20th century were a product of SLOW communication. Today I can learn about a failing real estate project from a world away in under 50ms, and in turn send bitcoins to buy said failing project and make it successful. Didn't need a central bank to facilitate that amount of liquidity..............................

You could always try bitreserve.org, they allow you to hold your funds in BTC, USD, EUR, GBP, CNY, GLD which is then transferrable between currency types (good for volatility). You can then peel off a couple BTC as needed and transfer to snail money (fiat) if your merchants only accept that sort of thing, better yet look for merchants that do accept bitcoin and reward them.
The downside to bitreserve is that the security and capabilities of their software is unknown, so theft is always a risk. I tend to trust larger entities like coinbase.com and circle.com more.

If you goto receive in multibit the wallet it wants to receive to is random each time you hit it. Even if you hit it and cancel (nothing received), the next time you hit receive it is a different wallet address.
With Mycelium the wallet only moves to the next address if funds have been received to it.


So in Multibit I have wallets containing btc that Mycelium does not know about (hasn't searched yet)

Mycelium will allow you to import xpub and will generate public keys identical to your trezor. So you can leave it disconnected and receive funds to your addresses from your mobile. I suspect what you are looking for is a more specialized solution (the home bank comments). I think its a great idea and you can probably reference some of the python scripts for xpub key generation. Maybe a linux distro that boots from cd to provide banking services along side a trezor.

I think the investment in security is worth it. I wouldn't carry over $1000 on my person, or keep it in my house unless it was in a safe. Same goes for my BTC. With the Trezor you can carry all of your btc on your person, but have greater security than with a safe at home (or even a bank for that matter).
Unless you are a IT security specialist, I recommend hardware wallets to everyone with a sizable portion of BTC.
Learning the technology, and voting with your dollars is very important for nascent technology.
You can also look into the Ledger Wallet Nano ($40), but I am unsure of all it's use cases.

* As said before, don't store anything online if you don't have to.
* Use BIP39 HD wallets, you only need to remember a 12, 18, or 24 word mnemonic to restore all addresses associated with that wallet. This mnemonic can be written down easily. If you are worried about the quality of the RNG in the software you are using you can generate your mnemonic offline using dice.
* Get yourself a trezor for your paycheck funds. The trezor creates an HD wallet with BIP 39 (so you need to write down the words), the private keys never leave the Trezor so it can contain many bitcoins and still be relatively safe. If someone steals you trezor you get to an HD compatible software wallet and transfer your funds immediately.
* Get mycelium, this allows you to have a small quanitity of funds ready on your phone, and you can access your trezor from mycelium to move money from your 'paycheck' account to your hot 'spending' wallet
* I might consider using SDCARDS vs USB, as the firmware of a USB stick could potentially be altered to include mal-intent (though this might be a nation state v nation state level of malware). AFAIK the SDCard readers are also on the USB Bus, but their firmware is not accessible on other systems.
* With your word mnemonics you can use the offline system to create a Shamir's Secret Share, with this you could create a text file containing all (or some?) your mnemonics which is then encrypted and split to require M of N shares to reveal the orignal message. Store one in your backyard, give one to your aunt, put one in the safe deposit box, another in the false wall, etc. etc. etc. Geography and imagination can secure your coins better than any safe ever will.
Your previous methods work, but they seem a little difficult to achieve. Learning Linux is always a plus.

This is how big the address list is in bitcoin
As others have said, you can put any address in there but the chances of you finding bitcoins at that address or infinitesimally small. Searching EVERY address is impossible according to the laws of physics.
Transactions are created by the client, and signed by the client using your private key. They are then submitted to the network which confirms that the sender owns the private key that signed the transaction, and then add it to the queue to be placed in the next block. Other miners will confirm that signing/private key association and any invalid transactions are dropped from the system. You could hard code your client to take invalid transactions however the rest of the network will not accept what your client believes is true.

For me, yes, what else does your bank do for you?


When you take into consideration the fact that the network is also securing itself against malicious intent (like the bank vaults, armored cars, and computer security teams/infrastructure) I think you will find the legacy system is more expensive in terms of energy usage (amongst other resources).


I agree, and there was a time when networking infrastructure could not support the Internet. It gives humanity projects to work on, builds character.




People get hung up on the fact that bitcoin cannot process as many transactions as VISA or MC. Both systems are running on silicon, one just happens to have decades of optimization and development. In the end anything that can be processed on Visa/MC silicon can be processed on dedicated hardware (if not commodity hardware as the wiki states)
@_date: 2015-04-09 18:23:11
I think you can take into account the infrastructure required to transact money and realize that a guy in a coffee shop sending money to a guy in another coffee shop doesn't require buildings, meetings, agreements, and all the other overhead (not even a shred of paper).
Consider this, in 2013 Western Union has earnings of $1.38B on $21.1B in transactions with a profit of $0.2 billion. This implies an average cost of 6.5% per transaction and 1% profit, not much wiggle room vs bitcoin.
The bitcoin network externalizes the costs of running a global western union through inflation, so for the end user the costs are far lower.
**Like you said though, the end game is a currency that doesn't need conversion**

Depends on the wallet type, you will want to understand the difference between a single address wallet and it's private key and a HD (hierachal deterministic) wallet, it's seed value, and it's private keys.
In a nutshell the Single address wallet has a private key for each wallet, very tedious.
HD wallets have a 12, 18, or 24 word string that is used to generate ALL the wallets allowing you to do some interesting this (reference bitcoin wiki)
Seeds are sometimes compatible amongst devices, some early version of HD are unique to their software (I think electrum?) but others follow BIP32 and BIP44 standards. 
Make sure you backup your word strings, private keys, etc and you will be fine. 
As always I recommend getting a trezor, super simple and secure.
@_date: 2015-04-18 20:33:24

I have been denied charge backs when fraudulently over-charged for shipping, so there goes that argument.
You want to talk about problems with scaling bitcoin, then lets talk about bitcoin. Not about how some company shifted fees to people that carry balances, pay interest, and support a legacy and inefficient payment network. Bitcoin will exist with 1 million users, or 7 billion users. Computers process the transactions whether they are on the bitcoin network or the credit card network. (very similar technologies that use silicon chips to do logical processing)

I think both are equally vulnerable, both systems have shown security vulnerabilities in the past year. I imagine both provide additional security to encrypt private keys on disk, but that can always have vulnerabilities as well.
If you have large amounts of btc I would go with an airgapped machine that never gets on the net and/or a trezor.
The trezor is portable and can be used in conjunction with mycelium so you can access large sums of btc without carrying around paper wallets or your air gapped machine.

No, you can have multiple wallets on the trezor but there would be no point in storing all 3 in one location. (Unless I just wanted 3 in the warm wallet)
Hot Wallet - private keys in memory of the device, most hackable, small amounts for daily spending kept here.
Warm Wallet - larger amounts, private keys offline but convenient enough to sign transactions (plug into mobile or laptop). Cracking device and stealing keys is non-trivial and in the event of device loss I can quickly move funds from this wallet before it can be cracked.
Cold Wallet - largest store of funds, created on offline air gapped systems using multiple signatures geographically distributed to secure access.

I don't think we need a large central holder, we will just have capital lending markets that will serve this function, and whether you have 1 million BTC or 100 satoshis you should be able to participate (in lending), interest rates will fluctuate with demand and ratings.
Part of the argument at the turn of the 20th century was that we needed a central bank to prevent bank runs, prevent depressions, and smooth economic growth. Although I can argue that the GREATEST depression happened under central banking I will also concede that the idea of having a central location for interest rate management was a good idea since communications were no where near ubiquitous or real time. Given the slow movement of information, a centralized system can help coordinate.
Flash forward to the information age. I can call, video chat, and now even send $1 million clear across the globe (as long as there is internet, and there will soon be global internet) in realtime. Information about prices, events, economic growth and depression is available instantly. Given this amount and accessibility I think just the shear ability of ourselves to move into and out of investments in near real time will help to smooth economic growth. People worry about deflation with individuals sitting on investments at the natural birth rate (1%ish?) I would argue that anyone dumb enough to take 1% a year will eventually lose out in a world (solar system) that is seeing tremendous growth.

Bitcoin has been relatively stable for quite a while. Boringly stable :) I understand your argument, but I think we are moving towards a world where prices are changing on a constant basis. If people want to gamble on futures for price stability there will be market makers and buyers in those markets. But an efficient economy is an economy where prices are constantly in flux. (supply and demand)
I might be wrong on that subject, as modern econ will argue that price stability is the hallmark of a functioning economy. I think this view might be related to the idea that communications and information used to not be instant, or ubiquitous. It will be interesting to see where digital currency takes economies.
