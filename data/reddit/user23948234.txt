I spoke with a tax attorney about that and basically if you lost money, you should file a return. First, it gets the IRS off your back. Second, if you made a profit in 2017-2018, you can use the losses in the earlier years to offset the gain. So the IRS ends up shooting themselves in the foot.

They issued a summons to Coinbase a few years ago and got info from them.

Be sure to put that when you respond to the IRS's Letter 6173. Do it for the lulz.

If you sold the coin for $5, you will recognize a capital loss of $995. If the $5 grows to $1000 again and sell it then, you will recognize a capital gain of $995. Assuming it happens in the same year, it will be a wash and you will pay no tax.

I think you should deal with it otherwise the chances are very good you will be audited. The IRS's commissioner said that the agency would issue new regulations to replace the outdated Notice 2014-12 so hopefully that will provide some relief to people like yourself.

I know people who got the 6173, 6174 and 6174-A. A tax attorney I spoke to said that it's nothing to worry about - yet.

In that case, I'd just respond to the letter saying you only lost $5 and send a copy of your account transactions.

He said to have a tax professional review the returns and then send a response to the IRS. Best case scenario is that they will close the case without doing anything else.

It is scaremongering but a tax lawyer I talked to said that the IRS is serious about this.
@_date: 2019-07-26 03:48:48
The problem is that there are some people here who will actually believe this.

A tax lawyer I talked to said that the IRS is sending these letters to everyone who had a Coinbase account regardless of whether they filed their returns correctly or not. It is likely that the IRS contacted other exchanges and they probably caved rather than litigating risk losing their customers.

I contacted the agent but she didn't really help. She didn't know anything about the trade rules. Basically said to send an amended return reporting all of the transactions. I recently spoke with a tax attorney who wrote an article about this and he said to just send a letter telling them you reported everything correctly.

A friend of mine who got a letter 6173 said that they were targeting his transactions from 2013 - 17.

I spoke with a tax attorney about this. As of 2018, the 1031 like kind exchange rule applies to real estate only. But even before that, it is probably unlikely they will apply. 
The attorney said that the IRS might try to argue that cryptos are like stock or foreign currencies where there is an exception to the 1031 rule. But if that was the case, the statute should have said so. He said some more but it went over my head. Something about 988 transactions involving foreign currencies...

Seriously. Contact a tax professional. In the U.S., the Department of Justice will LOVE to make an example of some of you.

You can deduct capital losses against capital income. The $3,000 limitation applies when you try to deduct capital losses against ordinary income.
@_date: 2019-07-26 00:55:25
Anyone who had a Coinbase account.
@_date: 2019-07-27 16:23:33
The 3K loss limitation only applies when you try to offset capital gains income against ordinary income (like wages). You can offset any amount of capital losses against capital gains.
@_date: 2019-07-26 01:27:31
@_date: 2019-07-26 04:02:46
Depends. If you sell it at 50k, then assuming you just held on to the currencies, you will have no gain or loss. On the other hand, even if you did multiple trades, if you added all of the gains and losses, you should still have a zero gain or loss. 
The problem is if you made money in 2017 but lost money in 2018 - which I think happened to a lot of people. Then you will have to report a capital gain in 2017 but a capital loss in 2018. To my knowledge, you cannot carry back a capital loss to a previous year.
@_date: 2019-07-26 17:04:38
I was agreeing with you for the most part, you moron.

The thing about that is that even someone with a relatively small amount could have $20,000 account value in coinbase considering that BTC was around $18,000+ at one point. Even if you had a small account and it's worth little now, you're better off contacting coinbase to see if your name was given to the IRS.
@_date: 2019-07-26 15:56:30
You may as well send the IRS with amended tax returns reporting losses so you can offset them against future income. They will wish they never contacted you.
@_date: 2019-07-26 04:07:10
Im sure you meant this in jest but just in case for some people....DONT DO THIS.
@_date: 2019-07-26 17:06:11
"We can't legally tell you" sounds like code words for something.
@_date: 2019-07-26 00:40:19
The IRS in 2013 issued a summons to COinbase asking for info about their users. Coinbase tried to fight it but eventually settled giving information only on the users who had more than $20,000 of value in their accounts. They might have targeted other exchanges who likely caved rather than fight it.
@_date: 2019-07-26 00:50:27
Most likely.
@_date: 2019-07-26 00:58:14
The IRS's Notice 2014-12 says that you have to treat bitcoin like property. So if you buy bitcoin, and later sell it, you have to report any capital gain or loss. It gets more complicated if you use multiple exchanges.

When you get an audit notice in case the recipients decide to do nothing.
