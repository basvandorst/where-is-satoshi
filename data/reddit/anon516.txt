What you might not know is that email servers stay online to collect that email on your behalf. You can do the same with a lightning server.
So you can run a lightning node that stays online as a server somewhere. If your home internet is unreliable, you can have it hosted. Hosting has trust risks, but if it's for micropayments of $1 or $2 maybe it's not that bad.

Note to readers, this is a non-tech savvy explanation of the technology, if you're interested.
You don't need to understand the technology behind Lightning Network in this detail if you just want to use it, just as you can use Reddit without knowing HTML and Javascript. Similarly, you don't need to know how SegWit works or what it is, in order to use Bitcoin as a beginner. Great stuff to learn, but not required.
In the future, Bitcoin wallets will have Lightning Network integrated just like every other piece of Bitcoin technology has been integrated. It will be ideally completely invisible to you, and the only thing you will notice may be faster confirmation and lower fees.
For example, when you pay, your wallet would detect if there is a valid way to pay via LN and if so, use that. Otherwise it would just fallback to a direct Bitcoin payment. Since it's automatic, you won't really notice any difference other than it was paid faster and with lower fees.

People are brainwashed into fear. And people carelessly look to government as an authority on things that they have no business nor any form of expertise in. Such as medical health, public education, or finance.
People fear terrorism even when it's a million times more likely to die in a car crash. People fear drugs, when the majority of drug usage hardly affects anyone but the adult choosing to use it. People fear what the government tells them they should fear.
The root enemy is power - and one of the tools to gain any power is to use fear. mongering tactics. It surfaces in a subtle way, that most people are now brainwashed into thinking, "safety first" and "safety at all costs" which always sounds reasonable at first. But there's a stark contrast between reasonable safety, and outright manipulation and exaggeration.
Saying that KYC and AML is an effective tool against money laundering is a complete joke (look at HSBC and it's money laundering in the billions - with zero accountability or consequences). And saying it's a tool that is worth the "inconvenience" of a surveillance state is an outright insult to anyone who understands basic privacy.
The IRS for example, has committed huge crimes such as illegally tracking and creating watch lists of political groups in the US - consequences? Little to none. The lawsuit was settled and the IRS paid a small amount of money. A shame.
So what has to change?
1. The U.S. is hit by a national bankruptcy that is the equivalent of the fall of Rome (as Rome also fell, not from war, but from printing too much money out of thin air). This dismantles the country in a lot of ways, making room for a takeover by an entirely different political party (finally). Or we are led back to socialism in which case we revert thousands of years of progress. And suffering just continues until we get back to sound economic principles and real education.
2. The minority of activists/people who believe their rights are being broken in every which way (and outvoted in every election, being the minority) continue to express their disgust for the system by accumulating BTC and learning how to do it in the inconvenient (but politically empowering way) that is deemed "illegal". Much like how marijuana smokers didn't just stop because the government told them to. This group, small at first, grows in popularity - seeing the wrongful immoral incarceration of perfectly peaceful citizens. Once there is a majority, then pressure can finally be placed on the government to change their policy.
So either or both bankruptcy (1) and acceptance (2) could be the ultimate trigger for changing the system.
But this is going to take an extremely long time. It took many years to get the general public to stop fearing marijuana. But we need to stop the war on drugs, war on science, war on terror, all of which are a war on our rights. The government can't be trusted for much more than running a few small international commerce-related functions. Everything beyond that is a power grab by the majority to express it's will over the minority. The majority, in this case, can be represented by "majority of money" or "majority of votes" - a very blurry line these days.
Everyone's best bet is to HODL, educate themselves and others, and understand how Bitcoin could provide a financial safeguard against a national bankruptcy.  The national debt is no joke. The rising medical costs of baby boomers is no joke. The costs of a college education and college debt is no joke. And the fact that people continue to yap endlessly on political channels about a government "solution" to a problem created by the government itself should be enough to see that for now, it's just going to get a lot worse.
In the meantime, I exist to fight these invisible chains for the sake of myself and the sake of future generations. It is the only responsible thing to do.

You do understand that the real solution is to avoid government collapse in the first place by transitioning everyone to stable, unforgeable, uncorruptible money. The tragedy here is that they held on to their government bucks way too long. If they all switched before this whole mess, the ones left holding the government bag would be a tiny percentage of the population. This is what happens when people don't understand inflationary monetary policy. It has destroyed one of the richest countries in the world. And there are many others like it, that are not immune.

I don't think it's necessary. It only hurts people trying to get into Bitcoin. By providing access to fraudulent scams such as the bcash phishing scheme, it only legitimizes it for unknowing new users. They are part of the confusion and problem. By working against, rather than for, privacy, it's rendering many facets of Bitcoin useless. And by refusing to release the hard fork value of those who purchased Bitcoin before the bcash fork, so that people could dump them - they are intentionally forcing all Bitcoin owners to hold bcash even if they did not want it, and thus lowering the value of Bitcoin itself. At this point, their intentions are clear and it is not in favor of Bitcoin but just to capitalize on Bitcoin as a business, Bitcoin and their customers be damned.
@_date: 2019-03-24 20:10:28
It's one thing to give customers what they want. It's another to be a willing participant in their demise with known fraud such as bcash, altcoins, etc. It's clear their priority is not the long-term financial security of their customers, and rather, it's the short-term business that they can squeeze out. I'm not saying businesses need to be altruistic, but at what point do we keep forgiving businesses with downright shitty ethical practices, on the basis of capitalism? By all means, I don't think they should be shut down or banned. But I think that telling everyone what a shitty company they are is FAIR GAME in a market. Warning everyone is FAIR GAME. People often defend businesses as if we're saying they should be shut down or laws be made to stop them. That is not the intention here -- it is only to let new users avoid the hell out of Coinbase because they are not going to help you. They have every right to continue their business the way they want to, as much as I have every right to warn people about them.

Anyone who says "diversify within crypto" is scamming you. And I say that as not someone who is a fan of Bitcoin, but a fan of whatever coin actually has the most open, widespread, highly technical engineering team of contributors combined with the greatest security (hashing power) network.
If any of the other coins were even anywhere near a close  or  then I wouldn't be saying this. But the difference is so extremely stark, that it's like betting on 10 horses in a race when 1 horse is a stud, and the other 9 are barely alive and on life support.

Imagine you lived in a country where the government keeps printing money like crazy, such as Venezuela.
Let's say in the beginning, 1 BTC = 9000 bolivars.
Not exciting yet.
But people start losing trust in bolivars because the government makes so much of it. You auction off your XBOX and when the bids come in, they are just higher and higher and higher, because a bunch of people are receiving money so easily that it's just not worth much anymore.
Today, 1 BTC = **2,278,902,174** bolivars.
So you might think it's impossible for the same thing to happen in the USA or UK or Australia or any other currency, but the fact is, every government either implicitly or explicitly, is printing money like crazy.
Once people begin to realize their money is worthless, the panic cycle to get out of monopoly money begins, and then hyperinflation begins.
It takes very little time for people to lose trust in their currency - because they visibly see and feel the difficulty in buying everyday items. Everything is being priced higher and higher, and all the money you had becomes worthless. How can you trust something that lost all of it's value?

So isn't the taxable gain or loss based on the value changes after the fork?
Say $10k before the fork.
After the fork, you have $10k of coin A and $0k of coin B.
But the market adjusts to the natural total value, so now it's $9k of coin A and $1k of coin B.
Taxable change: $0
If both rise, it's the same as the larger single entity coin rose on it's own too.
So coin A $11k and coin B $1k.
Taxable change: $2k

Fiat value has crashed, it's just that nobody realizes it and is going about their daily business as if everything is fine. If you and me both accept that a worthless piece of paper has value, then the transaction can work. But as soon as people start saying, "hmm wait a minute, does it have any value?" then the last person holding the worthless paper loses the game. 
Could this argument be applied to Bitcoin? Of course, it could be applied to any asset. Houses, gold, tulips, anything. But in the end, if one type of value is ignorantly being inflated by politicians and the banking cartel, while another is mathematically secured never to have more than 21 million by the largest decentralized computing network in the world, then the sensible people will make an intelligent choice rather than value nothing at all.

Using a non-KYC exchange instead of Conbase maintains your self-sovereignty which is a key feature of Bitcoin. That is, respect for your privacy.
If you don't think privacy is important, then you understand that you're simply putting the government in charge of your money and Bitcoin is simply another PayPal or Venmo (except with volatility).
And sure, some people just want to make a quick buck - get rich quick. But that's not an educated group.
When you entrust Conbase with your PRIVATE information (name, social, etc.) letting them track and trace your coin activity linked to you, then you become fully target-able by various government agencies.
You may think that's paranoid thinking, and that you're not a criminal, you pay your taxes, but you also need to understand that the government at any time can decide that anything can suddenly be a crime (e.g. holding of gold became a crime in the U.S. - Executive Order 6102).
Now, you can mix your coins after buying from Conbase, but again, a court can potentially say this was a form of money laundering - an attempt to make money untraceable for criminal purposes.
I'm not saying 100% bad things will happen if you link your personal info to your Bitcoins, but I'm just saying that one of the most beautiful parts of Bitcoin is that you don't need permission from anyone - government, bank, or otherwise - to use it. But as soon as your identity is part of the chain, you suddenly NEED PERMISSION because they will have the ability to go after you - whether right or wrong - and in the end, you put your safety in the hands of lawyers and bureaucrats.
It's completely unnecessary, and it really makes me question why you want Bitcoin in the first place. If you just want to spend money digitally, we've been doing that already for years with PayPal.

Yes, some people want to lower the block size to make sure it scales to as many nodes as possible.
As far as lower fees go, LN makes transactions cheaper and faster (practically zero and instant).
And LN is on-chain, it's just a delayed on-chain TX and every TX has some delay (it's just a little longer on LN).

Seems like lightning is only about sending, in the fact that I can't send money to anyone without their express consent (they have to generate an invoice).

It "feels" free (as in liberty free, not lunch free).
But who printed that cash? And who is to say, they are not stealing your wealth while you hold that cash by printing more of it?
Bitcoin stops that entire counterfeiting scheme being used to rob everyone of their wealth. Trickledown economics is a fraud perpetuated by the rich. The middleman is robbing you during your transaction.
As Morpheus would say, "Do you think that is air you are breathing?"
Bitcoin doesn't bring down cost and time -- Visa, PayPal, Venmo, are all a magnitude faster and quite often cheaper. (LN can make it compete, however)
But Bitcoin does an excellent job of preventing the middleman from stealing your money - the endless, centralized, immoral printing of fiat currency.

It's when the big guy writes the rules and can cheat as much as they want. That destroys smaller folks much faster than anything else.
With Bitcoin, everyone plays by the same rules. You don't get special powers by election or heritage or even special powers by owning more Bitcoin than others.
Of course, some altcoins went in a non-Bitcoin direction by creating coins that are controlled by special owners, but that's precisely why they are shitcoins.
A lot of people blame capitalism and the 1% for creating massive poverty without understanding the fact that capitalism with a handful of select cheaters who can create as much money as they want, is not capitalism at all. It's just form of slavery.

If the only thing you care about is the price, and not why Bitcoin has any value at all, then you're basically gambling at a casino and throwing money into the wind. If you define good or bad decisions based on the price alone, you'll feel good when it goes up and bad when it goes down, and have no control.
There's a big difference in knowing why something has value, versus hoping something has value.
There's also a big difference in actual value and perceived value. That is, regardless of the traded market price of Bitcoin, the given practical demand for Bitcoin in direct usage terms (direct = to facilitate a specific transaction, or direct = to use as a store of value and protection) is far superior to blind speculation (= gambling).
So if you're buying anything other than Bitcoin, you are basically foolishly gambling. You can also be buying Bitcoin as a foolish gamble too, if you've done zero research on why it has any value.
I implore you to dig deeper, rather than being the next gambler who loses all their money, and build a foundation for why something is worth investing into OTHER than the gamble-hope that it will rise in price someday.

LN is \*extremely\* new. So yeah, it's like trying to use a email just after it first came out. Confusing, hard to set up, and makes you wonder why even bother with it if you can write a letter to someone and pay a few cents in postage instead.
LN is \*not ready for mass adoption\*.
In fact, when it is ready for mass adoption, you will be using LN without even knowing it. That is because smart wallets will automatically complete payments based on the optimal route comparing on-chain vs LN fees for your transaction all behind-the-scenes.
LN is a fancy code-word for an internal technology of Bitcoin, much like SSE is a code-word for a technology used on Intel CPUs. Unless you're some kind of CPU-level engineer, you probably don't care about it. Likewise, you shouldn't care about LN if you're just a Bitcoin user.
Eventually, LN will just be a standard part of Bitcoin (through modern wallets) just like CSS is a standard part of the Web even if the average mom &amp; pop has no clue what CSS actually is.

Propaganda is a risk, but what we've learned from the Scaling Civil War is that Bitcoin will not negotiate with terrorists. Bitcoin is still operated by technical merit to change, and you cannot rip out technical merit of all engineers who see right through propaganda. Even if you manage to convince every single average Joe, you won't convince all engineers.
Yes, it's possible and maybe even likely that someday mass adoption will start to bring in the chants of the ill-informed claiming that it's better to add KYC to Bitcoin ("Think of the children!"). It does not matter, because you cannot convince all the libertarian or anarchists who love bitcoin to run that "Disneyland"-version of Bitcoin so there will be a fork. And let's play a completely unlikely but hypothetical scenario where maybe the Disneyland-version of the Bitcoin fork has a 95% majority of node support. Well, then what we have is some giant system that looks like PayPal today. In other words, this nightmare scenario is simply what we have today. Completely irrelevant to me. My actual Bitcoin will live on in a minority system with the hope that someday people will wake up to the issues again.
I don't think such a ridiculous fork would ever happen, but even if it did, that version will eventually get burned to the ground by the privacy-problems of a KYC Disneyland-coin and everyone will just go back to the strongest money ever invented: Bitcoin.

Let's say there's 18 million BTC in circulation and each is worth $500k for a market cap of $9,000,000,000,000 e.g. $9 trillion.
We're still not even half of 2018's national debt of $21 trillion.
So we double BTC price to $1,000,000 per BTC and we're finally getting close to 2018 national debt.
But we're in 2019 and by the time BTC is at $500,000 we'd probably be in 2030 or something and I can ensure you the national debt will be way more than it is in 2018. Maybe something like $330 trillion if the nation is even still operational.
The end of the US dollar would mean something more extreme like the Venezuelan situation (and even then, it hasn't "ended"). Maybe something like how it's currently 2 billion bolivars per BTC, so 2 billion USD per BTC. I'd pretty much consider the USD dead at that point.

We need to stop the spread of alternate "cryptocurrency" because everything that isn't Bitcoin is a scam or an exponentially more risky project than Bitcoin which is already an extremely risky project. There's no need for the average user to care or get involved with unnecessary risk. Bitcoin is all that is needed.
If you're a scientist, researcher, or developer working on a non-Bitcoin cryptocurrency project, you're exempt. But for everyone else, STOP SPREADING SHITCOIN TRASH. This is a PSA to help average folks from losing everything, as well as a PSA to prevent various centralization of currency in the guise of cryptocurrency.
I'm not picking on your project, I believe every wallet/exchange/etc that is offering multiple "cryptocurrencies" are inherently promoting the de-education people about things that are important. Decentralization, hash rate for security, etc. are critical - these things are not "nice-to-have" features of sound money - they are exactly what makes money sound.

There have been many threads on here about non-KYC options.
When you pay taxes, you don't need to identify your addresses (but this may change in the future). But you are correct, they will know you had some Bitcoin at some point. But that's very different from knowing every transaction.
It sounds like you don't care about what value Bitcoin fundamentally gives, and you're just hoping to earn a big return on investment while minimizing fees.
It's very disappointing, but I guess we can't stop people from shooting themselves in the foot if they are convinced to do it.

Cool proposal, I like seeing ideas on making LN more reliable!
Couple questions I have:


Does the payee need to keep all payments in progress and be able to ACK any of them, in case of delays causing an out-of-order retry (basically treating any new payments as unrelated to any previous ones)? Or can a new payment signal the payee to end a stuck attempt?


Could a stuck payment cause multiple attempts to result in fees being paid multiple times? Or just on the successful route?

Comparing Bitcoin to corporate-backed money-making schemes/ploys is the equivalent of people writing and publishing the U.S. Constitution, and comparing it to Apple iPhones.
The Professional Analysts: "The U.S. Constitution is interesting, but the most interesting part is the Freedom technology that is behind it. And since IBM and Apple are both heavily investing in Freedom technology, and I'm sure they will be able to sell it at a much better price, we don't really need the inalienable rights of the original U.S. Constitution."
Bitcoin will be successful the same way human beings have elevated their understanding from the dark ages, not from the profit margins of a marketable product.

My fear is that will happen.
The internet and Tim Berner Lee's vision of a decentralized collaborative space where people were interconnected without controls is long gone. It's now held together by the glue of corporations, governments, and agencies designed to control and protect us. Now, people just see computers as an extension of the same old stuff we had except faster.
I hope people will finally see that Bitcoin is a revolution as much as the recognition of the Freedom of Speech was a revolution. 
I don't want "cryptocurrency" to succeed, which today means corporate coins and government coins and all sorts of centralized nonsense.
I only want Bitcoin to succeed, and for it to succeed, the change of the mindset of people and their view of being able to transact freely without permission truly peer-to-peer.

People have the freedom to propose any stupid idea. But they will fail in the long term, even if they gain some kind of following, and push with heavy marketing, and even own a domain name that is basically the name of the original idea stolen and used for phishing. But they will fail, miserably. Because the one thing they can't suppress is knowledge. And you can't fool everyone, all the time. What will reveal the foolishness of an idea is time, as the actual reason why it is foolish will reveal itself naturally and inevitably. No matter the marketing or social momentum behind it. In fact, the long term really determines if something was foolish or brilliant regardless of what kind of support it has in the short-term. All arguments are ultimately resolved that way.

Did you know that public schools is a fairly recent creation in U.S. history?
You could even argue that education in the U.S. which was worldwide competitive before public schools, have dramatically fallen woefully bad since after public schools.
So you can't say "there wouldn't be schools" in fact there would probably be way better schools if you actually introduced financial efficiency and competition.
A lot of government income can come from non-tax revenue. For example, rather than stealing money from everyone to pay for a bridge, they can put a toll on the bridge.
If you ever drove in Japan, you'll know that most if not all the highways are "pay-to-drive". This ensures that it's the people using the highways that are paying for it, and not some "majority-rule-we-drive-like-idiots-so-fuck-you-bicyclists-and-telecommuters" system.
A lot of public services, parks, and even police/fire can be supported by communities pulling together to fund the programs voluntarily. In fact, why wouldn't I want to spend money to improve my own community? The primary problem here then, is that people are too poor to make contributions.
So if they are too poor to pay for it voluntarily, what happens if you force them to pay via taxes? Well, it doesn't solve their poorness for sure, so now legal issues come into play, not to mention all the overhead of government costs (employees, buildings, bureaucracy costs).
So why are people so damn poor?
Well, now we're at the root of the real problem that Bitcoin can solve. Money is manipulated, controlled not by elected officials but by a cartel self-elected, self-governed, unaccountable to anyone. Money is created out of thin air, and with fancy words like "Quantitative Easing" which basically translates to "Stealing From Your Momma".
We need to fix the damn system. We start with taking away their power (by using, holding Bitcoin). We also need to overhaul this draconian tax system that nobody can even understand without hiring professionals, and being used in extremely wasteful, unproductive, and sometimes even immorally violent ways.
So you think we need taxes, I get it. And my ideal tax-free world probably won't appear in my lifetime. But I will never give in to the idea that we need to take money from others, or that we even have a right to. Because bureaucrats are irresponsible as fuck, and people use the power of majority rule (voting) to make me a slave to their desires with the threat of violence (government agents knocking down my door for my peaceful protest).
If the government wasn't as nasty as it is, maybe I'll reconsider. But yeah, as it stands, taxes are 100% theft in my mind - until things change.

General adoption is still far away.
When Lightning Network is ready, you won't know it exists anymore. Just like you don't know TCP packets are flowing through the internet routers. All you care is that your webpage loaded, or that your Bitcoin payment went through.
Every Bitcoin wallet should have LN capabilities built-in and will be running in the background making smart decisions. You don't need to worry that your home router is managing bandwidth correctly or that packets are being transported in a fair manner. It just works, because it's been engineered to adapt accordingly.
It will be awesome when it's here. Right now, though, it's too visible and it's like seeing your car's engine through a transparent hood. And looking at that sight makes it seem like a tool too complex for the average person.
It's still at a stage where it's a toy for nerds. We'll get there. Just as we did with electricity, phones, cars, and the internet. It will become ubiquitous.

The planet earth has limited resources. But it's sustainable if we become conservative and recycle.
If we consume like maniacs on infinite money supply, we're bound to run out of resources quickly and likely destroy the planet in the process.
The price of Bitcoin will stabilize because there's nobody who can buy enough Bitcoin to destroy it without inadvertently destroying the currency they are using in order to buy it. When Bitcoin is stable, buying groceries will simply cost a handful of satoshis even if one BTC is worth millions of dollars. It's not really an issue, since BTC is divisible to 1/100,000,000th of a Bitcoin (or even smaller on Lightning Network) and easily more divisible with minor code changes.
Let's say there are a few rich people who own Bitcoin.
Well, the situation would be vastly different from today where the rich banking cartel can create as much USD as they want since they've co-opted the Federal Reserve.
No matter how rich you are with Bitcoin, you cannot create as much BTC as you want.
And the rich people cannot utilize their power without giving up their wealth, which they will unlikely do. If they don't give up their wealth, then they are not creating a situation where their wealth has any negative impact on prices (because the money doesn't go into circulation). In other words, for the rich to be a problem, they would need to spend it, but when they spend it, that would mean they are as not rich anymore. It's self-correcting.

It's not a risk.
If Satoshi Nakamoto decides to sell all his coins, there would be a massive dump in the price, but Bitcoin would be 100% perfectly fine. It will continue to function, transactions would continue to work, mining will continue to work, everything would be normal. Only the price would be affected, but that's not really a big deal. Because the coins would be spreading out, going to more people most likely, depending on how and where he sold his coins. It's unlikely he will find one large buyer. And if he did, that might not even make an impact on the price either, if that large buyer wasn't planning on buying from any exchanges anyways. Then, having the coins spread out among all those buyers, we'll be in better shape than before. The price shock would only be temporary.
Bitcoin will be healthy, regardless of what some of the early holders decide to do. Remember, if one person is dumping, another person is buying that dump. Otherwise, the dump wouldn't happen.
Don't be fixated on the price. Bitcoin actually has value and utility. It can do things that old money just can't do. Multisig, smart contracts, fixed inflation rate, so many good things. The price really shouldn't be that interesting.

Or they are just downright locked in fear of drugs and terrorism that they can't think of anything else.

I don't really consider those as details. What you described seemed like details. The most important question in a high schooler's mind should be, "Why do I care about mining? What is it even for?"
And the key reason isn't how it generates coins. The key reason is that it's a system that prevents fraud. It's like a boat, that doesn't leak. Mining ensures the boat doesn't leak. But what is more important, is that you're aware that it is a boat and a boat is a means of sailing across the waters.
Does that make sense?
So the most interesting approach to understanding mining, to me, is say: "here is my boat version  and here's 3 ways it can leak. So, how can we stop these 3 leaks?
In the end, you get mining, which is a way to prevent leaks in Bitcoin (leak = double spend, theft, hacks, etc).
The reason we hash this, or sign that, or calculate whatnot, is ultimately to plug every possible leak. And unless you see the leak, it's weird talking about, "we should do X". It should always be, "we should do X because OTHERWISE..."

The word "cryptocurrency" needs to die. 
Every modern currency when stored in digital form should be encrypted via cryptography making it a cryptocurrency. What we really care is about immutable, decentralized, permissionless, and hard currency of which there is only ONE: Bitcoin. The others are plagued by governance and control.
It's not interesting if everyone is paying lunch with their "cryptocurrency" called Facebook-coin or Apple-coin. I understand that cryptocurrency used to mean all Bitcoin-like currencies, but today, the alts have become so disparate that it's impossible to categorize them in the same group as Bitcoin.
I know there are some exceptions to this, and some projects are at least in principle trying to be decentralized, but only Bitcoin is secured by the proof-of-work and headless manifestation that is eons ahead of everyone else.

And if transaction transparency is such a worthy thing to society, why let banks commit BILLIONS of dollars of laundering and let them go with a slap on the wrist?
Bitcoin has no theft and fraud. Bitcoin is a protocol - an agreement between people and machines on how to exchange value. Unscrupulous people can use Bitcoin or Bitcoin-terminology to fool unsuspecting newcomers into theft and fraud. But again, a tool and it's malicious or benevolent users are two completely different things.

I think the reality is that, just like people have fallen prey to the predatory conmen of the government agencies, economic socialism, and anti-terrorist war machine, people will continue to fall prey to complete garbage like BCash,  Roger, altcoins, and ICOs. Education is key, but educating everyone about these scams so they recognize and avoid it seems like a bigger revolution than even Bitcoin itself.
The beauty of Bitcoin is that it's a honeybadger and doesn't care. People will continue to fall for the traps. But even if it's in the absolute best-interest of other people, we cannot force education on to others, nor can claim "we're the good guys, so we're going to force security down your throat by banning these scams for your own good" else we're no better than the government trying to censor and control everything. People have been falling for traps for thousands of years. It's not going away. 
That being said, communities of smart, educated, and knowledgeable people and those who wish to be educated should continue to grow and shut down total garbage because it's recognized as garbage, not as a form of censorship and control but because the most knowledgeable experts in the group have evaluated it as such. Fostering high quality communities, even at the price of excluding vocal but technically wrong opponents, is the only way to maintain quality. The world in general has become a large low-quality community, and high quality sanctuaries are rare.
It's admirable and noble to try to affect and change everyone, everywhere. But I think that the most organic, non-aggressive approach to this is to build a welcoming but high quality community that aggressively prunes wrong and inaccurate and fraudulent information that proves it's worth over time. Upon the external system failures, outsiders will peer into these high quality sanctuaries and see that the experts were right all along. And at that moment, they have a chance to convert from being low quality to high quality, to put away their ego, to gain objectivity, to be humble, to be skeptical, to learn and to do their own due diligence. Or they won't, at their own demise. Bitcoin does not care.
Bitcoin is the nexus that spreads economic and intellectual growth. Let it be the most secure and cared for by the most intelligent. Let us build the great community that we want, not by hiding the fraudulent and undesirable, but teaching people so that they instantly recognize it.
We need to continue to preach the truth about Roger's Bitcoin dot Com and how it completely confuses the term Bitcoin for the purposes of selling the BCash product. We need to continue to explain the complete garbage that is "big blocks" with sound fundamentals in the technical retort. Intelligent people will understand the failure of forever growing block sizes, there's no need for broad censorship.
We'll never reach the utopia of everyone being intelligent. There will always be fraudsters, with growing skill. And there will always be the lazy, or uneducated, or the gullible. We need to recognize this, so that we set our expectations to be reasonable.
Is Twitter a high-quality sanctuary of technically intelligent people who all recognize that the BCH  user is fraud and should be suspended?
At this time, I don't think so. Twitter (Facebook, and other popular commonplace platforms) are non-technical. The larger the audience, the less pruning should happen simply because it's at a higher risk of being considered censorship. That is, less agreement overall that it's bad.
I think though, if we can get to 99.95% broad support and agreement overall on Twitter that BCH is fraud, then it should get removed. It's possible. As more people abandon BCH from drama and chaos that is was born in, and more people realize that Bitcoin payment channels using smart contracts (aka Lightning Network) is a powerful, feasible, and even ideal solution, they should switch over to Bitcoin lest their own economic demise. It will happen, and it would be great sooner rather than later!
If more people understood that it was in their self-interest to be smart, there would be much less breathing room for scammers like Ver and Wright.

I explain that Bitcoin offers a high risk high reward opportunity that is a valuable member of a well-diversified portfolio particularly because it does not track or trend with most other investment types. This means it's a stabilizing diversification force.
I explain that the potential is too great, for it to not be a small part of your holdings.
I explain that you shouldn't be convinced by other people to buy Bitcoin, anymore that you need to be convinced not to throw your money into a fire pit.

Of course not.
It's because there is clear evidence of fraud and intention to deceive.
Corporate interests are using terms like blockchain to sell products, not create decentralized freedom.
Small groups are using the name Bitcoin to confuse newcomers, e.g. "Bitcoin Cash" in a large-scale corporate phishing scheme run by "leaders".
Even you seem to be a huge fan of Ripple, which is nothing but a corporate controlled forgery and counterfeit money.
If you disagree with all of this, I think you haven't seen all the evidence yet. I can provide it, but it's pretty much available easily if you dig a little bit.
I'm not saying this because it's my opinion, I'm saying it because I looked at enough evidence to make a logical conclusion here. It's not a personal preference or anything. If I didn't find evidence, I'd be saying the opposite.

It's like rehashing debates with antivaxxers and flatearthers over and over. We're so sick of repeating the same, technically sound, valid arguments that have already been made. In fact, all the "vaporware" arguments about Lightning Network have already been proven false with real software working every day. In fact, the "monumental failure" due to the block size that was said to be coming "in months" back in 2017 never happened. Bitcoin is doing better than ever, yet people continue to argue in favor of their corporate non-decentralized coin. The idea that Blockstream has any power was also proven false, because in the end, UASF proved that the users have ultimate say, not the developers who contribute to [github.com/bitcoin]( or the miners either. So we're done debating this old topic. Please, do your own research and don't bring up this unless there is something new to be said.

And when the government comes seeking information about what you did, you will be in a lot of pain. If you can't explain the destination address, you're basically withholding transaction information that may implicate failure to report taxes landing you into federal trouble. Remember, with the IRS you are guilty until proven innocent - you must prove to them that you know exactly where your money went and prove that you don't owe any money. Using a mixer together with coins associated to your name means a world of reporting trouble. Mixing is fine, as long as your name isn't associated to the originating coins. Once they have your name, the linking and responsibility begins. Even if you feel like no government agency has a case against you, why even allow the possibility? In other words, buying anonymously means not inviting litigation or investigation in the first place, by not attracting attention to yourself. There is something to be said about Satoshi-Nakamoto-Level anonymity.

I think one upcoming feature that will help with liquidity will be the ability to split a payment between multiple channels. Right now, if you have a lot of 0.01 BTC channels that collectively add up to 0.5 BTC the max you can send/receive is still 0.01 BTC. It will be great once we can use all the capacity together.
Autopilot also seems cool. I haven't tried it yet.
I think a good way to think of it is as routers, and having both good upload and download bandwidth. If you're trying to upload a file, and a route happens to have a horrible node on it that has terrible upload capacity, then the network needs to be smart enough to re-route around that node.
@_date: 2019-12-11 05:32:51
I'm wondering what happens with lightning rod when the rod node handling your transaction goes offline. To me, it's not truly sent unless the recipient can always pick up the payment. It seems still dependent on the network.

If they really wanted to build a better coin than Bitcoin, why not start with a unique name and let is become successful on it's own merit?
Because there is no merit.
Their goal here is clearly not to be a better technology. But rather, gain popularity and value through confusion by taking the name "Bitcoin".
Knowing Roger Ver is shilling BCash on Bitcoin dot com and also the twitter handle  is all about BCash tells you how deceptive and deceitful they are.
They refuse to compete on technical merit alone, because they know they can't. They have a flawed coin that is doomed on merit, and their only hope is to trick a few more newbies through the naming phishing attack before it all goes to 0.

It's about human dignity.
Private matters that cause no harm and are not breaking any laws, should not be 100% of the time be disclosed by force.
Do you wish to live in a glass house with people watching you take a dump or take a shower? No. Are you doing anything illegal? No. Is there a chance you could be doing something illegal, such as drugs or murdering someone? Yes. So because of that chance, you shall by law be required to live in a glass house? With zero respect/dignity to how you decide to spend your time or money in lawful manner?
You might think, "that's different - bathroom acts are embarassing". So what if you decide to spend your money on embarassing but perfectly legal things (e.g. adult diapers, diarrea prescriptions, sex toys)? And this information is made available to government agents, and exist on computer systems who got hacked, and all your private surveillance data is now on the dark web? How is that okay, either?
It should be a human right.
There is also the idea that certain types of transaction are inherently harmful. The constitution protects us from people who try to infringe on other people's property rights. So yes, a fraudulent transaction designed to steal from another person, is illegal.
The line quickly gets blurred (on paper) when someone says, "it's illegal to buy heroin". Well, is it the fact that they spent money to buy it, or is it the fact that they are obtaining an illegal substance? It's also "illegal to trade pokemon cards for heroin, illegal to trade poems for heroin, illegal to do someone a favor, for heroin". So, when someone says, "it's illegal to buy heroin" the focus on the heroin part is completely lost and Law Enforcement and Regulators now focus on "illegal to buy". Well, how can they stop illegal to buy X? Now they need to monitor the transaction/exchange. Which actually had NOTHING to do with what made the whole thing illegal. It's the heroin part. Not the transaction part. It doesn't matter what they did to obtain the heroin. But the regulators think that they have power over the entire statement "illegal to buy heroin" or "illegal to obtain heroin" so they go after controlling how it is obtained.
What happens when money is laundered? It becomes untraceable, yes. But aside from the fact that today it is said to be "illegal" by government, who does it hurt? Whose rights are being infringed upon, when money is laundered? The fact is, the transaction itself doesn't hurt anyone. If you killed a bunch of people to obtain the money, that is the crime. Hiding it, in addition to killing a bunch of people, is like saying driving a car after you killed a bunch of people makes driving a crime. Give me a break, it's unrelated. Once the crime happened, everything afterwards isn't automatically a crime. What about using those laundered funds to fund terrorism? Again, the nasty part isn't the transaction - it's the terrorism itself. You can spend money to buy an airplane, but that's not illegal. It's the moment you start flying airplanes into buildings and people. It's nonsense to mix the two, because the collateral damage is that you destroy the dignity and respect of millions of people who are not committing any crime, and yet being tracked and punished like someone who is on financial house arrest.
It's not about hiding anything. People in prison have their rights stripped away. They lack privacy. You are not in prison. It's about preserving your right as a free person, and not a prisoner, to not be punished for crimes you didn't commit.
We're heading towards a future where people are, by default, in prison. A prison with no walls. A prison of the mind.

Every government policy that tries to solve the problem of being too involved in matters, by getting more involved will push the few smart people towards Bitcoin.
Eventually, I just see a society with swaths of poor people who "didn't see the financial collapse coming" when it was slapped in front of them. And these people will blindly echo the reasons for collapse that is told to them by mass media. 
They will blame it on lack of regulation, Russian interference, a lack of innovation, a lack of effort by millennials, on the rich, the poor, the overtaxed, the undertaxed. Hell, they will probably even blame Bitcoin, saying that because a bunch of smart people fled to Bitcoin so quickly, that it collapsed the US economy. All complete bullshit, because smart people simply understood the utter waste and fraud that is the banking system, and fled it before getting burned. Defending your finances is important - nobody has a duty to prop up the broken dollar.
If the dollar was an alt-coin, and I told you that a large number of people have identified a bug in the currency such that unfortunately a handful of privileged owners can create as much of it as they want, would you invest in it? Hell, would you even want to hold any even for a short period of time? As an alt-coin, people would be dumping it as soon as they found out about this bug.
Bitcoin is superior, even if it is unpopular today. 
The question of how long the dollar will last is really just a matter of how much poverty will people take before A) they riot and overthrow the government, or B) they elect socialist leaders on the promise of wealth to everyone, and ensure the complete financial demise of the nation.
The reason I don't think any of this will get better on its own (even though technically it could reverse course) is that generally speaking, the voters are getting dumber every year. It's not meant as an insult, but rather, a natural consequence of an education system that is among the worst in the world. There are brilliant people in the US, but the vast majority of the voting public are not qualified to elect leaders (even if they should have the right to vote). This leads to people voting for horrible leaders based on promises being made that have nothing to do with what a federal government should even be involved with. Every election people want the government to do MORE, and that is simply an unsustainable system that will bankrupt a nation.
So in Bitcoin I trust. No alternative comes close.

People often confuse Bitcoin with a commercial product with a marketing budget. Bitcoin is valuable because it is valuable to everyone who takes the time to understand it. It is a human right. Nobody will try to sell you human rights. You have to own it. Bitcoin is peer-to-peer and headless. It's grassroots. Nobody should expect someone else to make it more convenient - YOU have to implement it. Once you understand it, and own it, then you become precisely the group that is responsible for Bitcoin. There is no us vs them. It's all us. We're all members of the Bitcoin team. And our objective shouldn't be to SIMPLY get more people onto Bitcoin. It should be to educate people to understand why Bitcoin is the human right to transact that shouldn't be taken away or controlled by any government or corporation. We need people who are educated in why Bitcoin is valuable - and it has nothing to do with making payments easier. Satoshi didn't invent Bitcoin because he thought it was too inconvenient to use PayPal online. We need to move away from the idea that making it more convenient is even a top 10 goal for Bitcoin. If you don't think Bitcoin is extremely valuable, even if it was incredibly difficult to obtain and use, then you've completely missed the point of Bitcoin. It's like saying we should make it more convenient to use freedom of speech or right to a fair trial. Well sure, but convenience isn't the point of those rights. It's the mere ability to have it that is the game changer and worth any complexities that arise from it.

Everyone is out for themselves, to survive, to be needed. Government also wishes that everyone needs them. They don't want to feel useless, or they will lose their jobs, funding, power, etc.
So, the government devised a plan where everyone is going to feel like the government is sorely needed. And that is, by making everyone feel extremely poor but not know why.
The plan was to create money out of thin air, inflate the currency, so that since 1913 the dollar loses over 90% of it's value. What this means is that everyone is now poor, and struggling.
And guess who will come and save the day? Ah yes, it's the government, our hero, here to save us from being poor! They will provide social security. They will provide health insurance. They will provide welfare. They will fix the bad economy! They will bail out the poor, poor banks.
And as things get worse, the government gets larger and people become more and more dependent on them, securing the government's "value" in society. All the while, they created the whole problem in the first place. And people continue to cry out to the ones beating the shit out of them, "we need you", rather than, "gtfo".

You keep using the term "cryptocurrency" and what I'm saying is that there is only one cryptocurrency that matters (decentralized, secure, non-corporate controlled) and that is Bitcoin.
Practically everything else in "cryptocurrency" is fraud designed to trick unsuspecting new users.

Yeah, they get user will get BTC. The pool operator receives cash. Then exchanges it to BTC so they can payout the pool members who only want BTC or can send payment in some other way. One way might be on the other side of the vending machine, you can also withdraw cash if you are a hashing member.
Or the pool operator needs to do KYC on a regular exchange to convert the cash to BTC. Renters and hashers remain anonymous.
Or the pool will actually rent the hash power from the members paid in BTC. Kind of a hashing power collector and reseller. In order to have the BTC to rent the hash power from the members, the operator will do KYC. 
It is not transactional between users, there's no 1:1 user-to-user relationship, it's all between the hash power rental company and a given user and the rental company needs to manage their finances appropriately to do this. Same with a local hardware store, obviously needs to buy the shovel they plan to rent out to users.

You will lose all your money if you try to play the timing game.
Instead , just putting $20 per week into BTC since Jan 2011 would give you **$6,110,625.91.**
That is a very simple system.
2011 too long ago for you?
Putting $20 per week into BTC since Jan 2017 would give you $5,736.17 which is an over 100% return (compare that with 0.01% APY that banks give you, or the 5-6% that a good index fund will give you).
Don't put in more than you can afford.
But don't put in zero. BTC is potential rocket fuel. A small amount invested goes a REALLY long way. If you have $100 to invest, put $5-10 into BTC and the other $90 into more traditional assets.
Be reasonable, steady, and sane. And you will reap nice rewards.

Forced charity is theft.
Why do people need a minimum income in the first place? Because they are poor.
Why are people poor?
Because of infinite inflation courtesy of the Federal Reserve.
Won't there still be some poor people even if we converted all of the economy to Bitcoin?
Yes, but we'll be in radically better shape as a whole, there won't be forced charity, and people will have money to spare for voluntary charity since they aren't being robbed blind anymore.
The exact same large population of people who favor basic minimum income would be the first to volunteer their extra money as charity, one would hope. If they are not complete hypocrites.
And with so few people actually needing such charity, that would be sufficient.
But right now, it seems everyone is poor, and it's no surprise.
It's very understandable that people want minimum income and it's a simple, short-sided, and satisfying answer - after being robbed blind.
In fact, I would 100% approve of minimum income for 10 years to help people recover from the disease of the Federal Reserve if it comes with the stipulation that the Federal Reserve is also disbanded immediately and all money must be held in Bitcoin with provable reserves.

Educating people about Roger Ver's scam would only drive away people who think that every stupid idea is legitimate. I will ruthlessly hate a phishing scheme because it preys on the unaware. If you think every idea, no matter how much it has been technically squashed, still deserves equal value, then "this community" would just be a bunch of idiots. I am simply making sure that people are aware of the scam, and hopefully smart people will do their due diligence from there on.
I will battle every shitcoin to the end, just as I battle for the end of the crooks in the Federal Reserve. Centralized altcoins, ICOs, permissioned Blockchains, and other complete nonsense systems are no better, and in fact, probably even worse in their intentions to steal and deceive.

Yeah and you would then have to prove you lost your coins. If there was any activity recorded after the date of loss, then it's evidence you lied.
If you claim they were stolen by a hacker, you need to prove that you were hacked. Provide police reports, evidence of hacking, hand over your computer or phone for investigation of the hack, etc.

Keep a few private key vouchers in your leather wallet.
You can print out paper wallets. So, let's say you want $100 in your wallet.
Print out 10 private keys with different amounts in them. 3 x $20, 1 x $10, 4 x $5, 10 x $1. Now you have Bitcoin you can spend without a phone.
Keep one extra paper wallet for collecting change.
When you buy something, give them the smallest bill that covers your cost. Then ask for change. Send it to your change wallet.
Now since you don't have a phone, you'll have to watch their software to make sure that the change was sent, and you'll have to trust them. But if it's just a small amount of money, and the merchant is at least somewhat reputable, that should be fine.
No battery or electronics required for you!

People don't want to understand nor take any responsibility. They want to make it someone else's job to fix a problem. Whether it's their broken car, their broken fridge, their poverty, their rights, climate change, or a corrupt global financial system, pretty much anything that is wrong with anything, they have an expectation that it's someone else's job to deal with it and not their own. They don't want to spend the time or energy to care.
Of course, there are rare exceptions to this where some people want to understand, learn, and care. But generally, people just go about their lives caring about what seems to be in scope of their own interests.

What if you have an equivalent transaction that returns the funds after the confirmed one succeeds?
Say you have two payments, A -&gt; X -&gt; B and A -&gt; Y -&gt; B. And also two return payments, B -&gt; X -&gt; A and B -&gt; Y -&gt; A. 
Once there is a successful payment, lets say through X, then the return payment through X is nullified because it happened first. And the return payment through Y is then processed normally, thus making the second payment equivalent to 0 (paid 100 satoshi, but also got 100 satoshi back, equaling to 0 as if it never happened). 
Of course, you're paying multiple times, but maybe for a $1 microtransaction, paying $10 for ten possible routes, and getting $9 refunded for failed routes is worth it to get the desired result early (but refunds taking some high number of blocks of wait time). So the purchase happens faster and more reliably, rather than wondering what went wrong and being stuck without whatever you were trying to purchase. 
It would just be another option for certain situations where timely purchase is more important than temporarily overpaying.

The "blockchain industry" shouldn't even exist. It's nonsense. It's like saying the "mathematics industry" or the "for-loop industry". Blockchain is a software algorithm for solving the need for centralized organizations, such as governments and businesses. So what on earth do centralized organizations want to do with such an algorithm, other than jump on it's hype bandwagon?
It's no surprise. Tech has gone through 100s of these buzzword trends in the past 20 years. Just like "Web Services" was a huge trend. What the hell is that? It's just a way software can work, there is no "Web Services Industry". People build APIs and you can call them a web service if they work on the web, but it's not an industry. 
Blockchain certainly isn't anything exciting, except to those who care about decentralization.

Be careful of hardware wallets. Any company could create a hardware wallet, include a backdoor that nobody realizes, and steal every coin ever stored on such wallets in a single huge exit scam.
Of course, this can happen on any type of hardware, but it's far more likely that a manufacturer specifically designing hardware for the purposes of storing crypto would be inclined to design one that can steal money. General purpose hardware is less likely, and any computer built before 2006 is even less likely as Bitcoin wasn't even invented yet.

Coinbase is a bcash phishing scheme supporting abomination. Not your keys, not your coins. DO NOT USE COINBASE. I repeat, DO NOT USE COINBASE. If you are bothering to buy Bitcoin, you might as well start to learn about what makes it valuable. And one of the primary things is that it cannot be confiscated, because of it's secure decentralized nature. By using Coinbase, you are basically circumventing everything that makes Bitcoin valuable in the first place.
Also, keep in mind that Coinbase threw all their customers under the bus when it came time to defend customer privacy. They supposedly hired some lawyers and lost, but their effort seemed nonchalant at best. They don't care about ANY of the principles underlying Bitcoin, and are simply here to squeeze as much profit as you can by selling you Bitcoin alongside complete trash tokens. It's clear they don't care AT ALL about your personal or financial security.
As a business, their practices are extremely unethical. They refused to release the bcash fork coins to owners before the fork, which was basically theft for all intents and purposes. So people were not able to dump their bcash, which of course was in their favor as bcash supporters.
Coinbase has a long history of manipulation, throwing customers under the bus, and supporting fraud.
WHEN you get burned by Coinbase (not IF), please do not come crying to r/Bitcoin because they screwed you over - there will be zero sympathy. For the last time: DO NOT USE COINBASE.

Too big of an assumption, with many libertarian-minded privacy-loving folks in this forum. Maybe in the average forum, but much of the point of Bitcoin is that it doesn't care about money laundering - and that's a feature not a bug.
Money laundering is not bad. It's only been framed that way due to fear of criminals and terrorists.
It's the same as saying, "driving a car after committing a murder" is "location laundering". And to prevent location laundering, we're going to require every driver to check in with the police with their ID on every single attempt drive. To make sure, that each and every driving attempt from your starting point to ending point, is fully tracked, has nothing to do with driving after murder.
It's the same as saying, "washing off the bloody knife after stabbing someone" is "knife laundering". And to prevent knife laundering, we're going to require everyone to check in with the police with their ID on every attempt to wash the dishes, use the sink, or in fact, be anywhere near something that could be potentially used to clean a bloody knife. This is for everyone's safety, and to catch criminals who may have a bloody knife and looking to clean it.
Yes it sucks if a criminal launders money, or if a criminal drives away in a car, or if criminals wash a bloody knife in the sink. But it doesn't make any sense to try to attack the problem of the crime itself, by heavily monitoring the kinds of acts that can be performed after it. It's beyond heavy-handed, it's intrusive and unreasonable and penalizes way too many perfectly law-abiding citizens.

Don't forget that simply owning and holding BTC puts a huge amount of pressure on the government. They need to be able to print money to fund their disastrous programs such as the war on drugs and war on terror, while keeping banksters rich. And due to fractional reserve banking, a single $1 taken out of the system also means taking many multiples of $1 ($10?, $20?) out of the banking system in terms of lending. And lending money they don't have, charging interest they don't deserve, is where banks are making most of their money. Nothing is free, especially "free checking accounts".
You can do your part in varying degrees. Taking your money out of the broken, corrupt, wasteful, immoral government system is the first, but perhaps the most important step. Not just for the sake of global society, but for personal economic freedom and power as well.
