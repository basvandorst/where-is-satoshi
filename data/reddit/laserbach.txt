How is this legal that bitcoin.com openly tries to confuse the customers with bch over btc. Can't there be any measures taken?

thank you very much for your reply!   
I havent thought at all about LTCs role in LN adoption. So that means BTC and LTC share the same LN network, hence BTC can utilize the payment channels created via LTC LN nodes, is this correct? I'm stilla noob, sorry :-(

@_date: 2018-11-25 08:29:24
