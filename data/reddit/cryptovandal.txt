Now *that* is a scam. I feel bad for the numpties that fall for this stuff, but then am having trouble picturing the person who is smart enough to enter their private keys into that site (i.e., know how to acquire them from whatever software/hardware it is that they use for a wallet), but not be smart enough to know it was a really bad idea.

You're deep into the lion's den bro. Don't be waving that flaming torch of facts around or you run the risk of causing a logic induced panic amongst the denizens of the den and might be attacked.
I did my first BTC transaction a week or so ago. Guess what? Didn't confirm in the next block, or the one after that, or the one after that, or the on after that ... ended up having to use RBF. Have used many other cryptos using the same wallets (Electrum based) and BTC was the worst UX by far. Plus I now have an unconfirmed (pending) Tx in my exchange account (due to using RBF) that will never confirm (because it was replaced), and it seems also to have messed up the exchange since I had to get them to fix a problem with other deposits getting stuck, ever since the RBF Tx. Sure, maybe that part is on the exchange, but this is the kind of stuff that users, especially new ones see and they don't give a shit; they'll just use something better/easier, like that crypto we cannot mention.
EDIT: Guess I got banned for this post. Just goes to show what the echo chamber here is like!!!

Only everything you have said to this point. The name calling is one of the ways it manifests. If you had no fear you wouldn't have to resort to insults and assuming that everyone you encounter is spreading lies (even though quite literally I hadn't said anything other than to call you out on your lack of argument). I guess we'll have to just accept that name calling and fear of strangers is your bag.
Oh, you seem to have missed a couple of down-votes on my posts. Make sure to flex those biceps and hit the down arrow. I know it makes you feel good.
@_date: 2018-06-20 13:40:56
I don't think we are going to see eye to eye on this.
I think you are confusing using the system and following the operational protocols with gaining permission. If I follow the rules, NO ONE can deny me access. Thus I do not require permission.
Let's agree to disagree.
@_date: 2018-06-20 12:35:06
In your twisted paranoid view of the world, I guess it does.
@_date: 2018-06-20 06:05:48
I'm sure regulations come into it. Whatever the reason though, my primary interest is in an alternative method to execute such transfers. Plus the idea of being able to send small amounts of money to anyone I want or need to, any place in the world, virtually instantly, has a lot of appeal to me too.

@_date: 2018-06-20 13:48:32
So you would consider that if I walk through my double door here, that if I follow the rules and walk through the gap, then I got permission from the doors to walk through? And if I try to walk through the wall next to them, thus violating the rules, I didn't gain permission? That's certainly an interesting way to view it, but not one I can subscribe to.
The thing is no *person* can stop me sending a BTC payment, if I decide to send one. The doors can't stop me walking through, if I keep to the rules (laws) of physics. BUT if there was a bouncer guarding the door and he didn't like the way I looked, he could stop me. That's the difference between permissioned and permissionless. You and I are on different wavelengths methinks.
Still, thanks for the discussion and the different point of view.
@_date: 2018-06-20 06:16:17


Noticed that too. Must be that the number of users trying to route payments has grown proportionally to the available capacity?
What is rather concerning though... to get near 100% chance the max payment is approx 0.00004 x 6600 = $0.26, based on that graph. Early days, but still, doesn't seem to have improved any on the Feb to Jun comparison. In fact it has gotten worse.
From a user experience though, does the payment fail, or another routing is attempted? Or in other words, what does the probability represent? User experience (look until path found), or probability based on randomly picking a single path? If the latter, then it's not as bad as it might seem (there are still paths that will work).
@_date: 2018-06-10 13:36:50
If the "average Joe" controls 1% of the network hashrate, then you are one unlucky merchant, IMHO. By that definition there can only be 100 (or less) average Joes in the world at any one time.

My question "So there is no coin on the LN... it's just numbers going back and forth?" was posed essentially as a rhetorical question in that BTC itself is just numbers going back and forth. There is no coin. In other words, both the BTC block chain and the LN are the same beast (numbers moving around), but they are different ledgers and different networks and hence different numbers (but not without any correlation). Maybe one way to look at it is a master ledger and multiple sub-ledgers.
Anyway, the claim it "Is Bitcoin" was what I was poking at. What is bitcoin if not just numbers? Obviously it's more than that else the BTC numbers wouldn't be deemed to have more value than the numbers on the VTC ledger, for example. I like to ask questions in the hope that I will get an enlightening answer and maybe I'll learn something. Sometimes it comes over as asking stupid questions. Such is life.
The Bcasher angle on this, I believe, is that LN "tokens" are not real BTC; they are just IOUs backed by BTC. For me, it's all just semantics. If I can covert to/from BTC then whatever those numbers mean on the LN is good enough to be considered as BTC to me.
@_date: 2018-06-11 14:01:43

LMAO! Thanks for the laugh. Stuff you do in computer games doesn't count. :)
But, I think you can safely say you have done more Reddit than most people.
I wonder how you hope to on-board new people to BTC if you are so hostile to new Reddit users?
@_date: 2018-06-20 12:49:29
They key point is that I don't need permission to involve the mining system and ledger and I'll pay a fair price for using it on my own schedule. Of course, in my utopia, everyone is already using Bitcoin and so there's no on-boarding process; just pure unadulterated transactions as and when required. ;)
EDIT: In my real utopia there's just hookers and beer volcanoes.
@_date: 2018-06-11 09:36:47
So the number of bitcoins on the block chain reduces and the number on the LN increases, equal to the deposit from the block chain on to LN?
EDIT: I think I replied and then you further edited your reply to add more detail.
So there is no coin on the LN... it's just numbers going back and forth?

So the BTC network's properties automatically extend to LN? Such as "proven to be robust"? It's a different network is it not?
@_date: 2018-06-20 06:27:59
Not sure how this will pan out long term, but based on current info, it seems like there *could* be a problem with transactions of around $50-$250 in the future. Too cheap for the expected fees on-chain (i.e., fees will be a relatively large % of the transaction, making it unpalatable), but too expensive for LN.

EDIT: Anyone got an explanation, as opposed to just a down-vote? Words can be helpful...
@_date: 2018-06-12 09:32:55
Also when you say 0-conf here, that's because those transactions are basically not broadcast at all (time delay) right?
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:56:10
Best also to use "median" fee instead of "average". That would be fairer. I did the calcs some hours ago and BCH was more expensive, but it was very much in the same ballpark as your numbers (so I would deem competitive). My main concern about LN that no one seems to have an answer for is that over time the fee to open a channel is inevitably going to rise. You could amortize this over multiple LN transactions, but if the LN and BTC take off as a world currency, I can see that initial fee taking off too.

*But virtual currencies may – will – become part of the economic practices of any country, anywhere.  Let me repeat that:  these currencies are not going away and they will proliferate to every economy and every part of the planet.  Some places, small economies, may become dependent on virtual assets for survival.  And, these currencies will be outside traditional monetary intermediaries, like government, banks, investors, ministries, or international organizations.*
@_date: 2018-06-11 09:27:28
If BTC is as successful as we all hope it will be, how long do you think the 600 sats to open the channel will last? (As in, how long will such low fees be available to open new channels as the up take increases?) I think the only model that will work is opening a channel once and using it (and re-funding it over and over). I have not used LN yet. Is this a feasible work flow?
@_date: 2018-06-11 09:47:18

OK. Great explanation. Not sure why I have been down-voted for my response. I guess people just see it as a "don't like" button instead of what it's really supposed to be used for.

If great writing involves trying to utterly demolish your opponent's character in the first few paragraphs without even the slightest hint of addressing any argument, then sure, it's great writing.
Before you point out the fallacy that I have assumed that the first 3 paragraphs are representative of the whole article, I'll do it for you. That kind of start, however, doesn't encourage me to read the rest of the article. So it's a bad way to attract any readers other than ones who are already going to agree with you no matter what you say.

I think we are using the word "permission" differently. If I want to use Bitcoin, you can't stop me. Nor can any miner.

@_date: 2018-06-15 08:12:00
Sure there is a barrier there, but the seed phrase is not the main issue, methinks. There's a big psychological barrier before anything else. We are miles away from the kind of adoption we would all like to see.

@_date: 2018-06-11 02:52:05

I'm a centrist (at last political compass test).
I'd say my beliefs are more tangible on the social axis as opposed to the economic one since I will happily admit that I don't know a lot about economics. My politics don't really play into my reasons for being here though. If there is some unintended side effect or conflict with a political belief of mine, I'll try not to get too butt hurt.
I'm mostly interested in crypto-currency because I get routinely screwed by banks when I need to shift money overseas and back again. I don't see why it should take days to accomplish, why I need to jump through hoops, and why I should be paying so much to do it.
The idea of being able to send and receive money, quickly, with minimal fees and without the requirement for, or interference by, any 3rd party is my utopian wet dream.
@_date: 2018-07-01 15:27:02


That's not how science works; classic band wagon fallacy.
@_date: 2018-07-24 06:53:49
I do a number of those and I would say that in my experience the fees are not competitive, but yes when BTC is clogged up, the fees can be lower. The main problem, however, is currency conversion; I literally get screwed on that every time. If I could send crypto to someone who wanted crypto, and thus no conversion fees it would be awesome.
Furthermore, it's not about not reporting to the government (though that is a bonus); it's about not having to be at the mercy of some 3rd party system and red tape especially when transferring large amounts (&gt; 6 figures).
@_date: 2018-07-05 14:17:25
Low fees weren't your thing then?

OK buddy, if it's so obvious. I am delivering you a pizza. You want to tip me. You have 90 seconds before I have to roll out to my next delivery. On-board me on to LN (list me the steps I need to take and that you would have told me as a delivery guy to do) and get me a $1 tip in 90 seconds.
If you can do that (and I can follow the steps that you tell me to take, in 90 seconds or less) I'll give you $10 (after you send me the $1 tip) for proving how obviously wrong I was.
Ball is in your court.

You must fully agree or else! lol.
Seriously, though, I do personally see value in the ability to transfer large amounts cross borders, so I am not against the idea of the store of value, but I just think that a crypto that can do that AND handle daily transactions will be better than one that can only fulfil one or the other.

No one is asking the question that if it's really necessary to get into complicated analysis of whether a payment for a coffee will be successful then there's something fundamentally wrong with the design and/or implementation of the system. (In fairness to the developers, it seems to be a design problem). For every obvious deficiency there's another layer of additional complexity proposed to be brought in to solve it. The technical debt mounts up layer upon layer. At some point you have to stop trying to suck a golf ball through a garden hose.

Who is really cherry picking here?
Your argument is that when no one used bitcoin, fees were low and now that people are using it and fees are going up, you want to claim that "when people didn't use it, which is the majority of time it has been around, the fees were low!". Asinine! 
The reality of fees for users is what is happening now and what will happen in the near future when usage goes up (if there is another bull run). We already know what that looks like since it happened earlier this year and it was completely predictable (and was indeed predicted). Your insistence that what happened from 2009 up until late 2017 is more important than what is happening in 2018 just beggars belief.


Utter bullshit! This narrative, that you appear to have accepted hook, line and sinker, is precisely to cover up the reality of fees. The average layperson only gives a shit about USD fees, because, like it or not, BTC's value is still measured in USD. I never heard anyone say that $50 USD fees were just fine, because when measured in satoshis / byte, it was really quite reasonable! Do you seriously believe the nonsense you have written?


The level of double think required to believe what you just said is unfathomable. But I see it here (in this sub-reddit) time and time again. The brain washing is real. I don't know how you lot manage to tie your own shoe laces. 
Look, if the satoshis/byte plots help you justify your unquestionable belief the BTC fees are the lowest ever then fine. You're only fooling yourself, but don't expect people who can think for themselves to go along with your nonsense.
