His [Bitcoin for BCash](  and then see it fall 98%. He [borrowed money from friends and family ](  to buy more every way to the bottom. He lost his [life savings](  and are now hugely in depth. He is now [suicidal for his losses. ]( 
There is a very good summary about u/slaxaphonic and his very tragic story and how he lost it all. You can [read about it here. ]( 
This is just so very very sad.

Very true. 
In this case, I’m just trying to help u/slaxaphonic so he can get some professional help for his mental illness. I’m not trying to shame him, just informing other people not to listen to him so they don’t loose their life savings as well and also becomes suicidal. 
I hope u/slaxaphonic will get some help for his gambling addiction and that he can start to work as soon as possible, so he will be able to pay off as many people as possible that he have borrowed money from. 
He wrote himself that he will never be able to pay off all his debts and that he will have to work for the rest of his life and never be able to retire.

Or that, when u/slaxaphonic lost [his life savings]( because he sold all his bitcoin for BCash and then it fell 98% in value and he bought more during [every single dip ](  and even borrowed money from [friends and family](   Now he is homeless and have been writing a lot about [ending his life. ]( is so very very [sad. ](

I would not do that if I were you. You are just feeding your gambling addiction. You have been 100% wrong every time, remember that. You gambled away your life savings. Don’t trade any more. Just go and get help for your gambling problems!  
Here is a [link ](  for anyone who wants to know more about what I’m  [talking](  [about](  
@_date: 2019-01-10 05:09:07
Does not matter what you vote. Historically you have been wrong 100% of the time and [you](  [gambled]( [away]( your life savings in the process.

This guy said it [best. ]( 
@_date: 2019-01-12 15:17:34
I don’t think you understand anything, when you [sold](  all your Bitcoin for BCash and then BCash fell 98% and you lost your life savings. After that, you started buying other shitcoins that fell even more, and you still try to get your lost money back. But, it is GONE. Poof. Like a magician making a dime disappear. It will never come back. Your life savings is [GONE]( [forever!!! ]( 
Pro tip: You need to seek help for your gambling addiction before you become even more [suicidal. ](

Calling it nonsense is a typical gambling addiction thinking. “I will win my money back”. u/slaxaphonic gambled away his life savings. He now tries to convince himself that the fault is other traders and that he is smart enough to make his money back one day. Read more about his very very sad story [here]( 
He will never get the money back. Ever. He needs to work for the rest of his life just to pay his lenders back the money he gambled [away. ]( 
@_date: 2019-01-13 17:33:13
Haha xD
@_date: 2019-01-12 15:27:53
Don’t listen to this guy. He is a gambling addict that gambled away his life savings. He sold all his BTC for BCash and then it fell 98%. Ge bought [more](  
during the entire way [down](  :D
@_date: 2019-01-25 08:45:39
You also thought BCash were close to the bottom when it fell from 10.000usd to 3.000usd. So, you started to invest your [life savings]( and borrowing money from friends and family to buy every single [dip. ]( 
We now know that your investment fell with 98% and you gambled away your life savings and are now [broke, homeless and suicidal. ]( 
This is so very very sad. 
@_date: 2019-01-20 19:39:23
Not as much as your portfolio that fell more than  99% and made you loose your [life savings ](  ��������
@_date: 2019-01-17 13:56:12
How dumb are they compared to you? I mean, you sold all your Bitcoin for BCash and bought every dip last year and borrowed money from friends and family to buy even more, just to see it fell 98%.  I mean, you have admitted to loose your [life savings. ]( 
Are you gonna seek treatment for your gambling addiction or are you continue to gamble away even more of your friends and family’s money that you are never gonna be able to pay back?
Also, I hope that you have dropped your thoughts about [suicide. ]( 
@_date: 2019-01-16 08:19:25
In the end, it is just a theory. But, what is not a theory is that you gambled away your [life savings](  by selling all your Bitcoin for BCash and borrowing money from [friends and family]( to buy more while it fell 98% last year. 
You have admitted that you have lost everything and instead of getting help for your mental illness, you are now thinking about [suicide. ]( 
@_date: 2019-01-10 09:51:34
I won’t. u/slaxaphonic gambled away his life savings and he is still gambling. He needs to seek help for his mental illness. 
To reduce the damage he can make, I will comment every post and every comment he makes for eternity so other people won’t listen to him (and if they do, they should do the opposite and they will be very very rich). 
@_date: 2019-01-13 06:29:42
Not stalking, I’m informing other people not to listen to him. He thinks I’m the master troll that have unmasked him and owned him, but I’m just doing God’s work :’D

Stop lying. Why did you sell all your Bitcoin for BCash and other shitcoins last year? And buying more every dip, borrowing money from [friends and family](  just to see it fall 98%?
How can you be bullish, when you [gambled away your life savings?]( 
@_date: 2019-01-25 00:20:21
u/slaxaphonic, do you think the dip will be 98% like the one where [you lost your life savings?]( 
@_date: 2019-01-18 04:34:17
u/slaxaphonic and I have lots of contact and he wants me to remind him that he gambled away his life savings and lost it all. He is a gambling addict and right now he don’t want to seek help for his gambling addiction. He think he will be able to gamble it all back what he lost. So, I try to remind him the he is very much in debt and need to seek help for his mental illness, one day he may understand before he commits [suicide. ]( 
@_date: 2019-01-16 08:31:20
And they shouldn’t take u/slaxaphonic seriously either. You gambled away your [life savings ]( selling all your Bitcoin for BCash and buying more during every dip last year while it fell 98%. You even borrowed money from friends and family and have admitted that you lost everything you had and are now highly in [debt. ]( 
@_date: 2019-01-12 18:03:29
Haha thank you sir! I have lots more, so stay tuned! :D
