Are you into Crypto or not? If not, take the money and run, if yes then welcome and enjoy the ride. 
And don't take financial advice from random Redditors on the internet
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:35:33
Government already hates crypto, and would probably say you gambled with the money
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:34:43
Not arguing with your logic, but look at Bitcoin from 2014 to 2017 and tell me you are still confident in that assessment
@_date: 2018-09-03 21:38:16
Can you explain how people betting on price going down vs people betting price going up moves the price itself?
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:28:55
Making up ground, then people understand their fees are high. Then they leave to quad or binance or somewhere
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:43:22
And any coin can overtake bitcoin, eth, even ripple. 
I hope you don't have it all in one spot.
Remember that things that were revolutionary are now no longer. Record players, cassettes, even cd players and the dang 3.5 mm in phones. Just advising to be careful especially with a student loan.
@_date: 2018-09-04 01:13:43
Thanks �� I knew the answer but not many people do. This is why the op cannot explain it and thinks the price always goes to the way it rekts people people like a magnet with no reason.

Omg man just Google the damn thing.

So easy to play with peoples emotions!
@_date: 2018-09-05 21:09:27
And 9 Months ago it was 19k
@_date: 2018-09-05 23:37:16
I think you are reading the chart wrong...
@_date: 2018-05-30 14:08:41
2013 is an entire year. You could have bought other coins, like eth when it first came out. Or bought it at 8 dollars and sold it at 1000 dollars with a strategy. Why didn't you?
@_date: 2018-05-30 14:07:34


TA isn't bs. With proper TA, you could have made 1.5 million dollars from 15k. 
Did you? Why not?
@_date: 2018-05-30 13:29:23
It is absolutely dumb to watch your portfolio like that for 3 years and watching it go down. Saying " well it will hit ATH again some time, just watch my 100k go to 10k and pray to see numbers again." 
Instead learn how to trade, learn TA, and learn risk management.  Have a reason to hold at times, and learn when enough is enough.
You wouldn't be holding going down in that, nor in this. You would buy near the bottom and sell near the top. And make so much more than what you did.
@_date: 2018-05-30 06:00:27
50% isn't absolute guessing. Looking on coinmarketcap and saying " ah... Eth was 1300 at one point. Let's buy it at 800."
You use risk management with TA and the odds of you coming out ahead and lasting years increases to the point of "how can you lose money in crypto"
@_date: 2018-05-03 14:54:56
lol love it. Thats what you get for trying that sheet.
@_date: 2018-05-02 22:26:38
Mogo is the one that you aren't buying bitcoin right?
Where you can't trade with anyone, and can't withdraw? 
You are just gambling with fake money, that ties to the bitcoin price. You might as well be doing it for real with bitmex futures.
@_date: 2018-05-29 15:15:52


Evidence of it being on or near those days 6 times in a row? It isn't being selective if it is a trend for the last 6 months. It is called a trend. It isn't ignoring anything, the market changes all the time.  Also the scale is in log. 
Things aren't coincidences. Only people that don't think TA works, think it is self fulfilling and confirmation bias, where as the people that use it are getting rich because it is proven.
@_date: 2018-05-30 13:35:27
Not sure if you are saying the opposite on purpose or think that proven trading strategies are bs and also believe watching your portfolio go down 90% is fine.
@_date: 2018-05-30 18:32:07
It's like arguing with a 5 year old.
This is why you won't get to millionaire status.
@_date: 2018-05-29 16:39:47
People can't just chart without some training. Lots of junk TA out there. The people still making money in a down trend are the ones that actually learned TA. Everyone that thought they were good in a bull market charting, are being tested in the bear market. 
Not really confirmation bias, just shit charting. This isn't one of those charts though.
@_date: 2018-05-30 17:31:42
You need to understand exaggerations
@_date: 2018-05-30 14:49:11
Wrong. Not every dude has lost it all. Many got out at the correct time. I suggest you watch my trailing stop loss strategy and learn when a good time to hold and a good time to exit is. 
All you have to do is learn to make life changing money and keep it.
@_date: 2018-05-29 13:49:55
Isn't it actually happened called facts and evidence? 
@_date: 2018-05-29 19:58:37
This is why you need training imo.
It is all about risk to reward with the calls that are made.
I explain it in my video here. You never enter a trade with a 1 to 1 risk to reward ratio. Because like you said, it is like flipping a coin. Make 100 bucks with the potential to lose 100 bucks? Not worth it. Real traders find the risk to rewards being 2 or more. It isn't about just making a call, it is about the reward with it. Two sides of the puzzle. If I find 10 trades, with a 10 to 1 reward. I only have to achieve 10% of being right to break even. I reduce my risk so I don't have to be 50% right or even 25% right in some cases.
@_date: 2018-05-29 16:59:15
The thing about TA, is you don't have to be right 100% of the time. Even 50% is decent.
It is all about risk management and seeing the opportunities and having an open mind to change your view.
The thing about trading is I can be wrong 70% of the time, but the 30% of the time I am right, pays for the 70% wrong ones and then more.
TA is much better than "I'm going to buy this coin now because it is down 80% from ATH" or "I think this is the bottom".
@_date: 2018-05-30 16:30:06
Nobody is telling you to hold a stock, Crypto, your house till the value is worthless, only you are. Holding something that occasionally dips 90% down is a dumb idea. You can 10x a 90% dip for instance, as well as all the emotional stress is gone. 
People will forever get stuck in the hold mentality, which is what holds people back from making life changing money. It is idiotic.
@_date: 2018-05-29 15:24:09
Look at the chart. It lines up. I dunno what other facts you guys are looking for. "Where's the facts?" Just look at the damn chart. It happened. Facts.
@_date: 2019-11-27 19:58:36
Because those require TA. TA uses Oscillators, past and present patterns to predict future results, to find a trend, other indicators that help predict where things go in the future, etc.
How can you not see how it relates?
@_date: 2019-11-27 16:27:27
So is detecting earthquakes, the weather, etc... Right?

Trillions of dollars that are worth 0. Like Zimbabwe dollars.

End of what?
@_date: 2018-10-02 22:27:41
Is it the bears, or the bulls that want to start from 3k.
@_date: 2018-06-11 19:42:44
You think this is the bottom?
People need to find a strategy and keep to it, if your indicators caught this dip even an hour or two before, and if you had stop losses correctly if you were in, nothing was lost if you were invested :)
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:14:39
That's the thing. People get obsessed with wanting more of a coin, that they don't understand that having more fiat is important. With more fiat you can have as many coins as you want at any time. You aren't stuck. You don't care about 30 bitcoins, you care about the value of the bitcoins. 
People will ride their 30 bitcoins into the ground just because they been taught this hold mentality.
There will be a day when Bitcoin won't be worth anything. A new coin will be number 1. 
My opinion is that all coins will either go to 0, like lots of scam coins. Or to infinity and be worth so much that nobody buys them. Sure you may have a Bitcoin worth 10 million dollars, if you could only find a buyer...
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:53:01
Compressed obviously makes no sense.
@_date: 2019-08-29 13:08:15
What? If I didn't take a small 5% loss on a -70% correction, I'd have 30k instead of 95k to play with.
Always have a stop loss and know when too much of a drop is too much.

Good to know, didn't know there was another option! Will check it out

I like your attitude. You can always tell who the real winners are on Reddit. You are in the 1%.
@_date: 2019-10-24 22:00:49
If you are holding long, you are holding contracts, most likely margin trading and can get liquidated.
If you are buying crypto and holding it long term that is what I think you are meaning.
And I disagree, but I am a trader. Should have stop losses or change your mind to bearish when the time comes like it did a bit ago. Have a strategy that doesn't involve holding till 0.
@_date: 2019-10-28 15:02:23
Its called a trading strategy, proven over time, that you use to predict future movements.
@_date: 2018-06-10 23:07:01
90% of people in this thread are losing money. 10% aren't and might be also making money shorting this.

I used to use quadriga lots, I do only as a fiat onramp and offramp. I use ezbtc as well to get in and out. I mainly trade on binance / bittrex, and I am beginning on bitmex shortly.
If you are looking for some content to watch on youtube, I have a couple of trading strategies, trailing stop loss and guppy methods that I regularly use. There is some risk management and other stuff on there. I been on vacation for 5 weeks so I haven't posted since, but just something to watch if you or anyone is looking for a decent strategy.
@_date: 2019-10-28 21:52:54
Most people could easily follow an indicator such as the ATR or the Guppy methods.
Most people however don't look to improve their trading, they simply just keep throwing money at the problem.

Confirmation Bias is the significance I see :)
@_date: 2019-12-15 17:25:32
Its called no strategy but throwing more money at a problem. There are no clear signs of reversal right now. Its best to learn a guppy method or ATR method to see these signs.
@_date: 2019-12-26 16:45:00
Or you let the people vote. Like Reddit. Filters out crap pretty good that way
@_date: 2019-12-15 16:19:29

Was Bitcoin born a year ago today? Or why did you pick today again? Because it's confirmation bias. That's why.

@_date: 2019-12-16 18:06:20
Because it is currently still going down. There was no new high ever made for 3 years.
The title and everything to do with the whole year ago, now up x% doesn't do anything but create hope for holders. 
Flip the chart and share the highs, still doesn't matter and still trending downward right now.
@_date: 2019-12-15 16:31:28
My mind is blown with that statement... Never thought it like that.
Since money is a 0 sum game. Debt is owed to who? Who is the rich one? Especially if the government has debt too.
@_date: 2019-04-05 20:43:50
How do you know how much to place in a trade, when to buy a dip, and where you are going without ta? You would have bought the entire Bitcoin dip from 20k to 3k? Eth 1400 to 88? 
You need a strategy or else you lose money. If you made real money in stocks you would know how to turn 5k into 100k in a year. 
Clearly you have not made any money in any trading. Change my mind.
@_date: 2019-12-18 15:02:58

If I invest in usdt, will there be great gains?
Actually I've made money just sitting in usdt because the Canadian dollar is shit
@_date: 2018-11-21 12:48:57
That money is gone. What I'm referring to is if you have 100k. You have 100k regardless if you are down 90% from 1 million dollars or up to 100k from 5k. That money is gone or the now and you have 100k, or 100% of your portfolio still on the line.
Saying I'm down 90% I don't have much to lose compared to my portfolio ATH, is a dismissive attitude that causes people to think it isn't as bad as it is, and can't get much worse. It can always get much worse because ATH is never guaranteed and the fluff numbers you have had before, the market doesn't give any shit about.

@_date: 2018-02-05 02:33:29
I went out of some coins at the top last year.. bought back in lower, but some of them I didn't pay attention to and missed the boat buying back in higher. I think you have some breathing room till back to 17k. But even if you buy back in at 16k, was it worth it? That's what I always asked myself. Buying back in now pretty much gets you double what you got out at, so now you ask yourself. Is now a good time to get back in, if you believe in 100k

@_date: 2018-04-10 04:17:56
It never jumps past, and risking 1% doesn't mean I buy with my entire capital and put a 1% of my buy in price at stop loss. That would be dumb. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 15:01:55
Use both and then you get the whole picture.
You can't use risk management without a target, how do you get a Risk to Reward ratio?
@_date: 2018-04-13 01:30:44
Because we went up 10% in a day? What about the part about being down to 35% of the ATH portfolio?
Shorting at the right time is a good thing. Just like buying at a good time is a good thing.

When they ignore your facts, and be stuck in their own world, I dunno what else I would call it. 
20 years using linear charts... Probably only looking at slow +- 5% stocks or forex where log and linear are pretty much the same.
I can't imagine anyone using linear charts in crypto and being successful. My charts never come off log because the assets are so volatile in percentages.
@_date: 2018-12-11 18:19:46
They both are, and you are the one that said "real dollar value".
Did you just switch sides now?
You can't seem to distinguish that -50% is -50% on a log or a linear chart. I thought thats what we were looking at when regarding your 


@_date: 2018-12-11 18:12:59
There isn't much of anything else to be said since you won't understand the reality of the situation. 
Its like talking to someone that the world is round, vs the world being flat. You look at the world as being flat, and if I told you to point the route from Canada to Russia, you would draw a straight line on a map, not realizing that you un flatten the map and the straight line you drew is actually curved in the real world.
That's about as constructive as I could be with you.
@_date: 2018-12-11 20:16:02
If you are using a chart, chances are you want to be accurate. On the left there is a tool called price range. This tool shows you where 50% lands. You can also do quick math and do 50% of 20k, which.... OMG lands exactly where it should.
Again, its like trying to explain the world being flat vs round. 
I don't understand how you can use a visual representation of price, then bring math in at the end. You don't seem to understand logarithms, exponential math, or even compounding in math. 
You must be trolling or lost because I just can't believe this. 
"Let me make this simple, I move my eyes and find 10k with no math. I can't comprehend how to not move my eyes and find 50% of 20k".

TLDR, you are very correct, and that KyOatey is ignoring the entire fact of Log charts.
Its essentially like talking to a gambler at a casino that tells you they won 10k over their lifetime, rather than saying they won 10k and lost 90k in their lifetime. 
Disassociation from reality I call it.

Wow, you are so out there when you don't understand Log charts from Linear charts. You seem so far gone out there to help.
