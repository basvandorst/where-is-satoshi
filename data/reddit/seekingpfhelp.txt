Weaker dollar increases domestic purchasing power while lowering international purchasing power.
And you make more with the new tax plan
Kinda looks like the goal is actually working, to lower domestic prices, so stimulate our local economy. Something about America first and stuff

Fake news is news spun with a false narrative, literally everything on CNN. Read the same story across multiple webaites and see the narratives that are spun. You only think how you think because your brainwashed by mainstream media and reddit propaganda machine.
If you need an example, read the story about the Japanese koi fish pond. Look as all the fake news spinning it as Donald Trump is a ditz who dumped all his food and was disrpectful. Now look at the cropped video they made to support this. 
Now watch the unedited video and laugh how ridiculous fake news gets

Youre all stupid as fuck because a token is a security which represents a value to be traded as a financial asset. A quarter is a token because its traded as a representation of value of 25 cents.bitcoin is not a token because it doesnt represent a value by being backed. Its value is onky what people sell it for. Not like you can go sell a quarter for more then 25 cents because its backed to repsent 25 cents. Gold backed quarters are tokens. Usd backed tether are tokens. Bitcoin is not backed, its not a token

Your comment is ad hominem. Your fighting the person not his position, get over yourself. "They " dont matter. What "they" did does. They are scams even if they dont offer dividends because bitconnect offered dividends

You're literally saying his knowledge led him to operate a shitcoin for profit. Sounds amoral, so yes, he's a stain.

What? Where do you get off assuming that? He implied your mom was a cheap smash. Literally said, "8k, can do your mom like 1000 times"
Nothing to do with necrophilia. If your mom's dead she can still be a cheap smash cause she's shite. Just because she's cheap doesn't mean the guy who rekt you with the comment is into smashing your dead mom. Consider training your brain to not be so stupid, it shows and makes you resemble that cheap hooker look your mom had

Uhh no... if your bank charges an absurd wire fee you need a new bank. 35$ max, as low as 15 some places. Wires don't cost a conpany 1000$ to transact so they will never run that high

Loans are only possible in a fiat system. Things would cost appropriately in a system where price can't be inflated due to inflated money supply.
