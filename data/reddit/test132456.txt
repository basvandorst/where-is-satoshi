This!  With the massive price increase and exposure, there were lots of interested big buyers that wanted in but didn't want to increase the price any further.  Instead, this fucking dumbass dropped the price and scared away potential buyers and the newcomers.  He just set the Bitcoin price back several months, maybe years.
He should not be allowed to touch the remaining Bitcoins.  This is irresponsible not only to crypto in general but also the actual creditors.  He lost them tons of money, both real money in terms of selling below price and potential money due to the bear market he created.  
What a fuckin dumbass.

NO!  He has the responsibility to get as much as he could.  He lost real money by selling at a low price and potential money by creating this bear market.  This guy should not be allowed to handle the bitcoins anymore, at least not selling part.

Like I said above, he has the responsibility to get as much back as possible for the creditors.  He lost at least 30% worth of USD which could've been given back to the victims!  What he has done is borderline criminal.

It would've definitely gained some big buyers who didn't want to increase the price to get some bitcoins. You forget that buyers increase the price too when they buy a lot which is why sell wall is a thing.  In auctions, the big buyers can avoid that.

Why is kraken suddenly my buddy?  You're making more assumptions than I am.  As the person in charge of the bitcoins he has the responsibility to creditors, that's how the world works.  
Kraken is a o e of the bigger exchange that supports Fiat.  I don't care what you think about kraken but if one of the biggest exchanges that supports Fiat tells you to not sell on open market, you should reconsider.

He absolutely has the responsibility to the creditors, why else would he be put in charge.  This is not randomly assign responsibilities like you said. 
Him ignoring krakens advice of not selling on open market is even worse.  I just hope he did some due diligence by consulting with someone before it ignoring kraken's advice.

This is not about trading.  He can literally sell the bitcoins to big investors that can not trade in open market without reducing the price.  The feds did that with bitcoins from silk road.

From the creditors' point of view, he should've absolutely done an otc for a higher worth.  He just lost tons of money for the creditors both in terms of selling low and creating this bear market.

Still would be better than this hidden massive dump on the market.  An auction can actually attract buyers that can not participate through the exchanges, potentially adding new buyers/money.  Just selling like this should've been the last option especially since kraken already advised him against this.  I hope he did some due diligence.

I'm sorry, volume is a terrible indicator since most of it is from bots and they're mostly money that stays in the market.  Same money flowing back and forth will generate a high volume. 
This is a complete withdrawal from BTC to USD that's not coming back in again.  There are also lots of guess on the amount of actual money in crypto (not market cap), most between 6 to 10 bil.  400mil out of 6 to 10 billion is massive.

I'm surprised that more people haven't mentioned that this fucker could've done this on purpose especially after the reveal that kraken advised against this.  He obviously has some knowledge on crypto to handle this case but he still did this which means he could've done it on purpose.  I bet some "relatives" accidently bought during the price drop.
