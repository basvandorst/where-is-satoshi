Out of interest why do you think this chain would be of consequence in the long run? Doesn't sound like it would be anything to worry about versus the main 95% supported chain.
Could see it being an interesting relic.

Everyone would have coins on both chains, and who would be mining the new chain to keep it secure?
Combined with the obvious need to then execute a HF to lower the difficulty on the minority chain I don't find your scenario plausible. Transactions would build while the miner preferred chain would continue to process as normal.

The problem with this OPEC argument is that there are plenty of "oil" alternatives out there getting stronger each day and the supply of mining power is growing all the time and with the ASICs hitting process limits the cost of getting that new mining power is going to decline rapidly and have a longer shelf life.
If you add to this the possibility of stagnation and price decline the miners could start to fold. No one has a right for their business model to last, best they can do is adapt.
I can't help but think back to the old gold rush analogy, it was the merchants not the miners who got rich. Given the changing economics maybe they should be pivoting to sale of hardware from doing the mining themselves, it could be more profitable in a world of re-decentralisation.

Just noise? I want what you're on!
If you think Bitcoin is somehow immune to politicking you're clearly living in la la land.

While you might be right from a longer term perspective, the real world works through compromise and has large lags around adoption etc.
We can certainly put larger tyres on for awhile yet and plan for the bigger car as well. It's not a binary choice.

The important thing to realise with ETFs like this is your share will over time be worth a smaller and smaller amount of BTC.
The management fee will be taken from the value of the holding, so you will have the trading fee then these on going management fees.

It's a deadlock and unlikely to change anytime soon
BU: 35-40%
SW: 25-30%
I don't see how we get to the point where anyone would be brave enough to HF or UASF

I'm not sure you've been paying attention if you think there are no politics in Bitcoin right now...

I imagine he's implying that the ASIC supplier (bitfury, SegWit supporter) has control over the pools preference for BU/SegWit.
I'm not sure why this would be but people love make unfounded statements like this on both sides.

Says who? certainly seems like that action simply hardened certain political view points IMO.
I'm not supporting BU, but I'm not so blind as to not see the politics that is running through the community.

Agreed, they are on the 14nm now I believe so we're unlikely to see any major jumps in efficiency anytime soon.
Node improvements from here are proving hard for the big players so fingers crossed we'll see prices drop over the next year or so and this could bring a new wave of decentralisation.

Good time to move those coins to Segwit addresses!

Transactions fees are calculated by their size, so these 50 person transactions will cost a lot more. However there should still be a saving.
I think if you look at the block rate over the last while we've been running nearer 8 blocks/hour so this has helped see:

It really depends on what you mean by regulation.
Emergent market driven standards and regulation are what is needed. I have no doubt given time and resources a range of competing Bitcoin institutions will emerge and fill the needs of the users and most importantly compete with each other.
The period of time in which Bitcoin has actually been valuable enough to invest the kind of resources to yield these structures that will result in a mature platform is probably under a year maybe even 6 months.
Give it time.

Second this, really solid exchange. Not got the bells and whistles of a others, make sure you use the exchange part not the instant but feature

Rather than spouting slander about MtGox why not understand the issue which is the user was exploited and has nothing to do with MtGox
If he had enabled two factor auth this wouldn't have been possible.

I think anyone using mainnet LN should be aware it's early, but given the distributed nature of this tech no one will be saying "*we're out of beta"*, it'll just get more and more mature and robust.
I've been running LND for couple of months and it's pretty solid!

I think the term bubble is being somewhat abused when used with Bitcoin.
If you look through history bubbles result in massive mis-allocation of resources to unprofitable and overvalued assets and enterprises. I don't believe Bitcoin falls into this category, this is not to say it wont at some point, but for now I don't believe it has.
Importantly when bubbles burst the fallout either last indefinitely (think tulips) or prices are corrected to such an extent that prices never (in real terms) achieve their previous bubble levels. I clearly hasn't happened to Bitcoin since it's inception.
A more accurate way is to look at these are natural ups and downs in the evolution of a new asset.

Never underestimate the ability for people to tl;dr and make strong completely incorrect statements...

I take your point, however bubbles are not only visible retroactively. Maybe by the majority but there are plenty of people who can see them before hand. That aside I didn't rule out there being a bubble in the future, in fact I believe that is highly likely.
My point was more that the ups and downs that have occurred up to now are not "bubbles" as many people seem to refer to them as, I think they are simply normal cycles in an emerging asset in a large emergent bull market.
Finally, bubbles are generally easy to spot when you compare historic norms against the bubble (that's not to say it's easy to know the top!) For example with housing you can look at the ratio of income to prices or with stocks price compared to earning they generate. I'm not sure we have any accurate measures by which to judge Bitcoin and as such calling bubbles based purely on price is I believe simplistic.
Of course this could be the top, and Bitcoin has topped out at $900 and about to go into decline for years (or forever?). Anything is possible!
