It's part of okcoin's hot wallet. A hacker / thief withdrawing stolen coins from an exchange directly to a second exchange? I doubt any hacker would take such action.
Plus how did you conclude the sending addresses are bfx? Because they are multisig? There many other wallets and services using multisig addresses. Xapo for instance.

No problem. I don't want the reddit community to do anything at all, just saw something interesting and thought to share it, that's it.

I don't think so. Looking at yesterday's Bitcoinwisdom chart, no significant volume during this Swap...

I think so, but I'm not sure it worked very well (yet). The 2000 Swap offers @ FRR are still in place. But if they were taken (or if the same person already had a large(r) active BTC Swap at FRR) it might be lucrative: 
2000 BTC in a swap @ 0.1 % per day (minus 15% fee) will return 1.7 BTC per day... Better than most miners get. Not sure how much the pump+dump cost though.

It will result in higher mining fertility ;-)
