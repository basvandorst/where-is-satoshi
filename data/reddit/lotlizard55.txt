If you cant handle the price swings bitcoin isn't for you right now. It is hard but emotions need to be put to the side just like any other investment. Keep your head down and dollar cost average in.

A really interesting aspect of bitcoin is how it can make natural gas drill sites much more efficient. Good article on how it might play out.

If you are in the US just use Cashapp. Instant withdraws and they cover the transaction fee if you withdraw to a hardware wallet. Way easier to use if making small purchases.
@_date: 2019-08-07 03:55:19
You need to download a litecoin wallet from ledger live to your ledger. But your better off just buying BTC
@_date: 2019-10-09 16:01:04
I'd go with Kraken. They've made some significant new hires recently, so I'm bullish on them, and their site is visually pleasing.

Bitcoin will lead us to be more energy-efficient and can turn otherwise wasted energy into hard money in the meantime.

Something that needs to be talked about more is how much better BTC is when it comes to sports betting/gambling. I've been using nitrogensports.eu, and I couldn't imagine betting with dollars again. I don't need to contact my bank to authorize sending or receiving funds. Don't need to worry about my card getting frozen. Bitcoins censorship resistance is a beautiful thing

I have a question I hope someone can answer. Why does Venezuela, for example, have to pay a premium for BTC? Shouldn't we want the price to be the same if we want a global currency or store of value? 
@_date: 2019-06-15 13:49:56
That's just natural selection
@_date: 2019-12-22 20:54:15
Not everyone is here for the long term or wants to see bitcoin succeed. There will always be sellers. Every seller needs a buyer though.
@_date: 2019-12-16 18:17:18
I think a lot of young people worry about finances daily. If bitcoin only turns into a glorified Venmo then its a failure. I think we are only scratching the surface with bitcoin. Time will tell either way.

I initially heard about it from my cousin during Christmas in 2014-2015. I was only a freshman in high school, so I didn't have a lot of money, so I blew it off. Whoops.  2017 comes around, and I hear about it again threw $500 at it. Shortly after, I fell down the rabbit hole, and the rest is history. So glad I found a community with similar values. Can't wait to see where we end up. Merry Christmas!
@_date: 2019-12-27 15:30:12
Scared money doesn't make money. Learn about bitcoin first before you buy it so when it turns red, you have conviction in what you're holding and don't panic sell. You have to answer that question yourself this discussion board is not where you want to get financial advice.

Brother got his account suspended for sending btc to a offshore gambling site directly from cash app. If you're using wasabi or using btc to gamble I would suggest sending btc to another wallet first then to your desired location.

I  totally agree with what your saying but bitcoin is completely unique. If I can make money while in school and not need to balance school and part time job and take part in something special why not? Isn't the stock market/bond market gambling as well with mango man in office and trillions in debt? Its obviously a speculative asset right now but i'd rather have skin in the game than watch from the sideline.

Gen Z here checking in. I've shilled bitcoin over the years to my friends in high school and college and less than a handful have even a basic understanding of what btc is and even less own it. My concern is I feel kids my age should understand why btc is valuable because we've grown up with the internet and now we have the value layer with btc. Maybe I'm ignorant or in a bubble of my own. At the same time I know most kids aren't thinking about what money is or how it affects them they just want mint juul pods and clout. Either way I will be hodling and hopefully my generation wakes tf up. I also find it funny kids my age spend $40,000+ a year at private colleges and they look at me sideways when I say I own bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-02 17:04:49
I'm in the holding and accumulating phase right now. I have a long time preference for btc and in no rush to spend it right now 15-20 years. I'm saving up for a casa or nodl node right now. I feel like holding and running a full node are the best ways I can contribute to btc network at this point in time. To each his own

Everybody needs to take a step back and relax. This shit is only 10 years old. You can expect billions or trillions of value to accrue until this thing is experimented with and built on for a while. DCA and f***ing hodl

The best way is to show them you have a basic knowledge and understanding of the space, and when they are ready they will seek you out. It's too hard to go the other way round. What money is, isn't something people think about day-to-day and frankly, don't want to.
