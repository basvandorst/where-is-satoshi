Absolutely correct.
They just harm the whole ecosystem by putting up walls in general. Spread your sell orders around 200-300 USD to not create these "walls".
The problem is that when a wall is created other sellers just put their coins below the wall, therefore making it even harder hat it gets breached.

OK, but the heavy fluctuations will continue after September 10th, as long a Bitcoin Cash's EDA is active. When 50% of the hashpower switches over to Bitcoin Cash every few days, Bitcoin will maybe get 2-3 Blocks per hour during this time and in the remaining time 7-8 blocks per hour.
Still not ideal.

Nur 35 times the amount of coins

I do think the answer lies somewhere in the middle.
At the moment we destperately do need a blocksize increase because I think we all agree that the we are way over capacity at the moment.
But we also need some layer 2 solution working for the "small everyday transaction"
If you are moving huge funds around. Use an onchain transfer. If you are buying coffe =&gt; Use layer 2.

At the moment no tears since the price is still going down and they are basically making money at the moment when they sold yesterday ;-)

Only because heute is using an exponential curve. Use a linear curve and we are already short a couple of 10-thousands
