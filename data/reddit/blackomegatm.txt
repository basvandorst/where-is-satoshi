yeah... they can hedge themselves by getting some nice hot btc futures contract and them short BTC into oblivion and they would take no loss at all....

Money circling. Btc is falling, everyone is circling money to alt coins. Xrp is the coin of the day, tomorrow btc may start to rise again (unlikely) and the money will flow out from xrp and it'll experience a correction. Happening to bch right now...

I will sit out of trades tonight, for a few reasons, 1st is that I belive the worst is behind us. Going bellow 11k is unlikely and would probably cause a very destructive cicle for all coins, this is in no one's interest.
2nd - All noobs lost their virginity last night, they will be WAY more careful tonight
3rd - I'm fucking exausted, slept like 3-4 hours since last night, I'll probably just make bad decisions if I'm not in top shape for trading.

TAKE A DEEP BREATH, ANOTHER BREAKOUT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN

I have this lingering feeling that something big is going to happen a few minutes from now, too quiet, too flat, and I'm so sleepy I can't even keep my eyes open :(
I wish this had a PAUSE button.

How do I claim those fork coins every btc owner is suposed to be entitled to? Do I have to register on another Exchange? I heard people recieved bch for free when it was forked from btc....

I now have more than 50% MORE bitcoins than I had yesterday. It's too soon celebrate, but i think we are at the reversal point. 11k was seen as the limit for this drop in various models and sources.
Could go a little lower, but not by much. I wouldn't bet on it.

would wipe all of it
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:32:36
11k is the suport line for btc. There is still room for it to fall.

Asia (korea and japan) entering the market in the next hour.
I expect a quick small rise to maybe 13.5-14k followed by a steeep fall that should go into the 10k range.
Just posting to check if I was right a couple hours from now. Do not take this as advice for trading.

oh god, some on just lost a lot of money, that is longest red candle I've ever seen....
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:01:27
this, need to know in GMT -3
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:03:24
I thinks we are f*d either way.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:52:14
I completely agree, I have been watching charts all day, and the drop pattern is there. Get ready folks, it's going to be another one of those nights
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:10:37
bah, too many walls on both sides for a significant move this night, I'm going to sleep.
