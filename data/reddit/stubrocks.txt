Yeah, I'm not sure you could attribute any of those things to Obama, personally, though, except the healthcare (which is the biggest shitstorm we've seen since Operation Iraqi Shitstorm). And, he might not have started a war, yet, but he seems to be determined to get one going if it's the last thing he does before leaving office. Why don't you take your critique over to r/politics and see whether they agree or disagree?

Yeah, I care about decentralized currency equally with crypto currency. While I'm sure, statistically, that one is better than the other, I can't quantify enough good out of either one to feel good that either is likely to win.

As a libertarian, I can't stand the R or D sides. Not sure what else I'm supposed to care about.

The executive branch is nearly 90% of the federal government, if you include all the appointees. So yeah, it's the most out of control branch. There's no such thing as checks and balances, anymore.

If I may ask, what do you see Obama directly responsible for, in terms of the economy doing favorably?

I'm saying the office of the presidency is the most vile, destructive and dangerous thing we have in all of American history.

I use the term "experts" loosely.
