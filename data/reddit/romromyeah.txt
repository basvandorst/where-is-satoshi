What's the big advantage of a 529 over holding until he is college aged. One will clearly be a better option in 17 years
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:49:01
Curious about this. Would you mind doing some googling and research. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:28:20
Does that work for PoS coins too? It's like buying a house and adding a garage to your property and having to pay for the addition of garage, no? The laws regarding crypto are absolutely archaic and need to be updated. However the governments seems to be quite dysfunctional at passing legislation that makes sense 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:40:29
Yeah. It's going to 1 Million. How is that confusing. It's replacing store of value that other assets have like real estate

The world has changed. Did the internet exist for 3000 years. How much of life and commerce is handled through the internet now. Gold had its place because there were no better options. Now that there are better options it's not needed for its store of value. All the young kids talking iPhone and crypto. None give a f about gold. When they mature and their kids mature gold wealth will be a distant memory. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:50:56

Ok. If you want to buy paper that entitles you to something or mimics the price. Why would you want to invest in "copper", "oil" or even corn. That's not really investing. It's perhaps a form of hedging but there are better things to do with money

And the 20 dollars you pick up off the floor. And records of every gambling, make sure to keep all the tickets that weren't winners. But wait if you're married you can write off 500k from appreciation of your house. The laws are such bs with so many holes. They are laws, obviously but there are loopholes to f the poor. It's a rotten corrupt system. I think they'd why you see some with frustration, not solely because they don't want to pay taxes? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:40:44
If you think that the store of value of gold will go towards 0. Something I personally think. Than it will be an asset that loses value. If you think otherwise you can hedge appropriately 
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:42:39
Then if it's not money why the require msb license. Why has the government put people in jail for operating msb without a license. It's frightening. Clearly bitcoin is a unique thing and modern laws need to address the situation.
There is enough businesses that accept it to be discussed. It's probably about PayPal level circa 2006 in terms of volume.

Have him search his computer for popular bitcoin clients like bitcoin qt, electrum etc. If he gave you an email address have him search his email for accounts with coinbase and any exchange he remembers using. The more info he is able to remember the easier it will be for you to figure out what happened to them
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:16:12
Well usually with currency you don't pay gains on certain values. For obvious reasons. But it's says bitcoin is property. So why does coinbase need a msb license. In fact are gold dealers require to report sales to irs or are art dealers? Do you see the issues here. Government is bending rules and definitions to try to govern

From everything I have read. A lot of tulips were just futures and it was isolated to only a few people involved in this speculation compared to the amount of people currently involved. At today's prices people can buy 260,000, $500,000 usd houses from bitcoin. Also, keep in mind majority of the futures contracts were never enforced thus negating it being anything of value since they were unenforceable 
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:31:50
Well, technically you have to move all transactions over to benefit in the future, it would obviously be better if moving over wouldn't be as expensive as it currently is. If you aren't in rush you can always just use minimal fees
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:02:20
Don't worry you guys are doing things correctly. Although long term you will have to take a harder stance against supporting every alt split since it will become quite unmanageable. Maybe discuss with trezor and others what a long term solution and  support for chain splits going forward. If I come up with Bitcoin extreme cool tomorrow you guys should not support it etc

Why use the old paradigm of hiding gold without using it as a good thing. 30 years or whatever is enough time for someone to actually get some use from it or they will most likely never use it ever (lost)
Moving to a different address (which happens automatically after a spend) isn't that complicated 
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:03:24

Well, to some degree. The forums, moderators, only allow discussion of main chain as the real Bitcoin. I think they need to make it more open to discuss adjustments or alternative implementations. Bitcoin Cash is a fork and is not, by these mediums, considered Bitcoin.
Good discussion cant be had at rbitcoin or rbtc since no one wants to discuss anything. Try talking segwit in rbtc or alt coins in rbitcoin. You won't go far censored or not

I won't speculate on that, or what they know about tethers that isn't public knowledge. Tethers could be the biggest scam in crypto at moment and no one knows except bitfinex execs.

To me that's not much different than people throwing down a down payment on a house because the market is hot and going up. Downturn can wipe you out in real estate, stocks or even current job. When you expect something to go up and it goes down it has the same effect regardless of what it is

He is actually correct from an investment pov. You take out loans and do something, buy a house, business, invest etc. As long as roi on this is higher than debt it's the correct way to go. No such thing as peace of mind. Debt free for how long? Have to think long term, have to think big(ly) - saw that you're from t_d

Replace Bitcoin with anything else stock, car, house, business and reread your paragraph
Edit: I am well aware car is not an investment just trying to make a point that people do things besides pay off a theoretically low interest loan.
Also, investing into corn futures or gas options isn't anything particularly better
You're just trying to win an argument at all costs. People take on debt to buy a damn house. Almost everyone does this. They carry debt to have a house. Debt exists for a reason and is not inherently bad

Are you serious? They are currently Bitcoin Cash as a minority fork. They are trying to confuse people through deception. They can be more clear that they are a fork and they believe they are adhering to the original principles or whatever. It's like hey man come buy a diamond and then being sold cubic zerconium. It's clearly deceptive. Because of this people will get confused and could potentially be tricked. If they were the majority fork we'd be having a different conversation

Everything has potential for a conflict of interest. It's your job to evaluate those based on facts. Do miners have a conflict of interest when they make recommendations to change the protocol?

Except factually this is more accurate:
If an earthworm is split in two, it will not become two new worms. The head of the worm may survive and regenerate its tail if the animal is cut behind the clitellum. But the original tail of the worm will not be able to grow a new head (or the rest of its vital organs), and will instead die.
Not the best analogy there. There is clearly a lot for effort to confuse everyone about what the head or tail is

Good point, forgot about that. So turning auto update will likely make the wallet safer as someone who didn't do that could be stung first. If no auto updates how secure can they be assuming no back doors at moment. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:21:29
That seed BIP update was made after 2011. Don't look for any words. In 2011 you'd only likely have Bitcoin-qt and a wallet.dat file. Find that wallet.dat somewhere on drive. Sadly in 2011 i don't think qt had encryption on wallets meaning that there is possibility someone else can grab your coins if they went rogue 
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:54:57
Bitcoin Core is a safer set of developers looking for long term solution for exponential problems. Segwit fixed malleability and allows for more use cases
Bitcoin Cash is a linear solution to an exponential problem. Since it's release it is already hard  forking in next few days. Their code isn't as thoroughly reviewed as can be seen by the need for HF. They want a more temporary fix to the current problems.
That's my take. Long term, only ideas with exponential solutions will survive and become more efficient. Blindly following anyone without fully understanding will likely cause you to have a bad outcome. As I followed Roger's judgment on Mt Gox I decided I will not make any such mistake again.

EDIT: I have no idea how to add this text below the original link. if someone can assist i'll move this there.
Wanted to address some things after reading through what's posted.
As with almost all topics the conspiracy theorists have come in -&gt; I don't give a shit about Reddit Karma. I don't drive Uber. I have no control over that Bitcoin address.
Now, some have expressed complete hatred for tipping Uber drivers and go so far as to say they need to be reported and fired for displaying such a thing in their vehicle. I have personally tipped Uber drivers (rarely and mostly due to my own fuck up with dropping the Pin). I can give a tip to whoever I want as can pretty much anyone.
Those arguing how bad this is for whatever reason seem no different than how Traditional taxi companies try to argue their point. Yea i'm all for Uber cause fuck taxis! yea i'm all about making tipping bad and firing the driver because....?
Anyways, I want people to be reassured that it's not my QR code, i don't care about Reddit Karma, it does absolutely nothing. I think it's a great talking point and not an obligation.
PS: any uber drivers that leave customers bad feedback for not tipping (unless extreme circumstances) should get in trouble.

I don't know what best way to do it. Bitconnect is a ponzi with the price and data feed coming from a website they control and not a reputable one. I would say any website that offers 1% average daily return on Bitcoin is definitely a scam. Then again most of the advertising on coinmarketcap.com is scams. I've looked at them. I wish that they could be funded by real companies and ideas and not scams. I feel bad for those that trust CMC to do a better job.

Let me correct something you said wrong before proceeding. Many US states do not have sub minimum wage for restaurant workers like you are implying. In many states restaurant employees are paid minimum wage or more + tip. Who decided which people should or should not be tipped? You? Why is it acceptable to you to tip taxi drivers but not Uber drivers if you want to. Do YOU personally know about Uber drivers compensation or just using Uber marketing material for your decision making. Often times at restaurants people pay with card but leave the tip as cash. And for the last time... Tipping is OPTIONAL. I am disappointed with the lack of thinking and knowledge in this reddit I am seeing. Maybe just a few vocal people stand out.

Umm,  no. He is generalizing and saying he will report any Uber driver with such a sign. He just hates for whatever personal reasons. That's why I parodied him by saying I'll report him for something. Saying Uber is tip free is like me saying going to a restaurant in US is tip free, just cause that's what I feel like. He lacks an understanding of the actual definition of the word tip.

Sidechains inherently have some conflict of interest. I agree. However we are talking about what's best for Bitcoin today, and that seems to be not having a HF that's pushed by people who may have nefarious reasons. Bit main mines empty blocks, so them pushing for larger blocks seems super shady

The mod team at personalfinance are perhaps not communicating well, and people may not be doing the best to follow their guidelines. People have to look at it from both perspectives
Please note that we don't allow meta posts except in a few specially designated threads each year.
If you would like to discuss this more, you can send the mod team a modmail. Alternatively, I'll briefly (and only once) respond to each of your points here:


The community certainly dislikes bitcoin. I think they are right to be skeptical; you obviously disagree. But I don't think a "dislike" of bitcoin is truly your objection.
We don't censor bitcoin discussion any differently than any other speculative/volatile asset. Read rule 10 closely please - comments that are well written (typically longer than normal) and explain both the reasons (in an honest, non shilling way) and the risks (again, in an honest, transparent way) associated with bitcoin investing are generally fine. But saying "buy bitcoin" (and yes, I've personally issued over 100 bans just today for basically that comment) don't add anything to the discuss and essentially just "shill" something.
But I'll ban anyone that flippantly promotes a speculative investment - AMD, TSLA, JNUG, gold, any ICO, I really don't care. If you want to recommend something speculative, the obligation is on you to provide a detailed explanation.


Bitcoin's historical performance is nothing short of incredible. However, along with this unprecedented gain has come unprecedented volatility (on the order of 100x or more what a typical index fund has). The complaint against bitcoin is against those that make it seem like an easy "magic money tree" - there is real risk associated with it and that risk is too seldom discussed by its proponents.


O.K. - then explain what it is. Because if you, as so many people have done recently, say "buy bitcoin" and nothing more, that is pretty clearly shilling and does nothing for the conversation.


We talk all the time here about making sure your investments match your risk tolerance. But when you are talking about an asset that is potentially 100+ times riskier than the "existing model", you are talking about a major change in risk preference. You can't assume people know this intuitively or understand what it might be like to see 40%+ of your investment disappear in a day.


I agree to a point. Discussion is good, but again, comments like "buy bitcoin" add nothing to that discussion while running the risk that people get the impression that bitcoin is right for them (when in reality, maybe it is, maybe it isn't).


Which is why we don't flat out ban and delete in all cases - we simply say that if you comment here, you need to do so responsibly, as I've outlined above. But if you aren't even going to make a token effort to abide by the rules, you clearly don't want to engage the community in a real and productive manner.


Sure, if Bitcoin/crypto continues to gain in prominence, it will naturally be discussed more and more.


I tell you what - about once a decade, the S&amp;P 500 has a single day* change in value of 10% or more. Bitcoin does it multiple times a year. When it doesn't have a daily* 10%+ price swing (up or down, since volatility is important when thinking about risk), for 2 years in a row, come back to us. If I'm still around and the rules still look the same, I promise I will go to bat for you to make further changes to the rules.
* EDIT - I originally forgot to add "in a single day". Obviously a 10% swing over the course of a year happens much more often for both assets
Bitcoin can be a fine choice for some people as part of an overall investment plan. But to assume that it is the right choice for everyone, anytime, at any risk tolerance, is extremely dangerous. Lots of people have no business touching crypto right now.
You can be an honest advocate for it here -just don't go overboard with it. That is what the rules are truly saying in less "technical" form.
That's the response I got from them. It is fair

The coins sit at the private/public address. The client needs to download the data and manually verify all the blocks. Until the block that has data on your transaction is verified the software doesn't have any clue that there is anything there. That's a full client because it stores all the data and can't see into the future so to speak. If you had an spv client like electrum it connects to the full data on your behalf so it will have instant info on balances.

Big blocks are a contentious hard fork with no replay protection. It is also unnecessary at the moment. It's dangerous and reckless and pushed by a mining cartel and few interests.

Give me a real world example of such a law (for realistic purchase amounts where no identification would be required for a cash purchase) 
@_date: 2015-11-11 23:03:08
Still banned in some countries to this day. Regardless, they don't do anything without taking a cut or making a closed garden around their products. Both are not ideal. Maybe I can wait to judge their actual product, I just don't expect anything decent from them. 
@_date: 2015-11-16 09:56:01
Great talk. Thanks.

That's why the payment protocol allows you to specify return address. It's just an oversight for most people at moment and just needs a bit of educating as to confirming an address you are sending bitcoin to.

Are you able to offer lower prices  on all types of postage including flat rate
@_date: 2015-11-05 08:20:17
yes, but not everyone follows the switching between accounts routine. is there an actual reason (technical or logical) why this isn't implemented besides your reasoning. for example, most? banking apps require you to login to view your balances each time on a phone. also, usually for most people if someone takes your hard drive out they will be able to read your wallet details, just won't be able to access the funds... it's like having a company excel sheet, without a password on the file itself (perhaps a good example)

With a FIXED supply, that's exactly how anything including currency works. I'm sorry,  seems you lack basic understanding of economics. (I think you are just overly used to inflationary currency theories)

Are those problems smaller than the ones facing Fiat currency. Seems he doesn't even bother to explain why his Fiat is better.

just saw this. i am disgusted. nothing good comes when Apple tries to control everything, err i mean "improve user experience". expect, nothing good.

No such thing. Chinese use China made products because they are authorized by the government and have back doors. Given a choice they will prefer to use global products. While they are nationalistic, most aren't naive. They want Google etc
@_date: 2015-11-28 01:14:19
Glad to have you back answering  questions in layman terms
@_date: 2015-11-27 19:55:50
Not really, the output remains the same so no double spend possible 
@_date: 2015-11-29 18:24:26
Yes, this is the strange part that it allows you to change outputs.  Safe rbf makes so much more sense
@_date: 2015-11-29 18:23:28
Good explanation, but why are they pushing full rbf that allows people to change outputs, what's the use case for that? 
@_date: 2015-10-22 06:53:35
@_date: 2015-11-05 18:48:40
No, this is all peanuts to them. They spent 50 million on just a gas station. The government didn't buy bitcoin to dump it after their own auction. 
@_date: 2015-11-09 20:47:15
No, name and address are not required for legal invoice. Do you give it to McDonald when you pay with cash? Probably a misunderstanding on their end 
@_date: 2015-11-15 08:12:35
Since bitcoin is used by. 001% of population today do you not imagine that mainstream adoption will drive price to something well over your measly 2000 usd, easily in next year or two. 
@_date: 2015-11-08 06:16:43
That address is owned by circle, so it will not be associated with your brother. U can always send to his deposit address at circle, but never send to a from address from any exchange 
@_date: 2015-10-21 23:18:38
had similar thoughts. was told the wallet is used for short term storage only.
@_date: 2015-03-13 22:37:52
thanks. i figure i'd be more constructive. is there a reason you are doing things under different sites like India and Taiwan. I feel like 1 site may be better that way people won't try to copy and phish people when there are many different versions of your site out there?
also, curious as why you are cross promoting some lesser know bitcoin wallets as opposed to bigger ones like mycelium etc
@_date: 2015-10-26 21:05:07
can confirm. user rating was good. received crap.

Mailing checks is so antiquated. They could do better, they just aren't trying. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 20:42:59
1. yes
2. you guys seem legit, no complaints heard of so far
3. haven't tried so not sure
@_date: 2016-05-28 06:49:26
interesting, how do you know this?
i can't login because i don't remember the password. and password reset got me nowhere (no emails in regular or junk box).... i emailed the "send only address" 2 times trying to get a password reset help. and here i am

Snakes. They sound worse than Donald Trump 
@_date: 2017-07-27 08:44:05
You know what.. I'd be down with your statement but they fucked with Bitcoin progress and stole from so many people, the exchange can go f itself. No need to defend every single criminal behavior. 
@_date: 2015-11-06 09:38:49
Sadly, this time it's over. Professor Bitcorn was right.

It's not his to sell in the first place, but he can step down and donate it.

Yea. You're right. The other guy seems too keen to defend shady illegal activity. Perhaps btce pr team

If you read the actual indictment they discuss that Bitcoin is used with legitimate purposes but in this situation..... 
@_date: 2015-03-17 19:37:44
hi Analyzer again :)
@_date: 2017-05-09 20:05:48
Can't. Most of the balances were in bitcoin. They will never be able to cover that. They may only cover the fiat value at time of loss, but everyone would not consider that "paying back". Mark fucked everyone over
@_date: 2015-02-27 22:48:23
They use change addresses internally, they just don't necessarily display them in order to not confuse people. If you check the blockchain the coins should have been split into two addresses, sent to and internal change address.  That's why making backups frequently in those non HD wallets is important!
@_date: 2017-07-26 23:34:45
Wizkid was working with Mark internally. But, who knows

Tmobile offers free data roaming in pretty much most countries with gsm. If other carriers begin offering this, it will not be as necessary to seek out wifi hotspots. Also, does trusting anonymous bitcoin users to use your Internet connection in this day and age worth the possibility of extra personal headache?
@_date: 2015-02-08 05:54:18
Yea, a bit slow. Thanks for ninja upgrade
@_date: 2013-08-15 23:12:53
i remember you from the show! try bitpay for ease of use. you can always change things up later
