I sold at 2500 two or three days ago . . . Shorted at 2600 . . .
It's a fine time to buy if you are looking for intra-day flips . . . But the price is going to fall over the next week -- certainly between now and June 30 . . .

If you don't think that's the primary use of Bitcoin, you should educate yourself.

Except that I bought into this rally . . .  It's only after the last few days that it's clearly a bubble and time to short . . .  That distinguishes me from the clowns you just mentioned . .  
Moreover, I do believe that Bitcoin has long-term potential.  I just think -- and will be proven correct -- that the short-term run-up over the past month is indicative of irrational exuberance.  And the comments suggest that I'm correct.

See my comment here: 
It's hitting a ceiling.  The huge run-up was caused by people buying on margin and/or investing more than they can afford to lose.  When those people don't have enough in their margin account to cover losses, the exchange/ platform automatically liquidates the position.  Also, people who have invested more than they can afford to lose set stop loss (i.e., automatically executing sell) orders.  Both of the foregoing are common when there is a bubble and exacerbate the downswings because people are forced to sell into a think market . . .
However, when it plunges people then buy more because recently the downswings have been followed by upswings which means that there is a potential to profit on a quick flip . . . 
However, eventually, the market breaks the support and just plunges -- i.e., there is no bounce back . . .

@_date: 2017-05-26 01:06:53
Correct that bitcoin does not have government ties.  However, prices are nonetheless certainly influenced by government actions (like, for example, the price of gold is influenced by government actions) -- see, e.g., price drops a couple months ago when the SEC declined to approve listing of a Bitcoin coin ETF and when China cracked down on currency outflows AND/OR price increases recently due, at least in part, to actions by government in South Korea and Japan. 
As to whether the housing market is incredibly different than bitcoin, that's a more complicated question and the answer is both yes and no . . .  YES, the run-up in housing prices and the run-up in Bitcoin prices are different insofar as there are a myriad of reasons for the housing market bubble -- among those reasons, as your comment suggests, was the fact that the U.S. government created Fannie/ Freddie and relaxed lending standards in an effort to "democratize" home ownership . . . But NO, the run-up in housing prices and the recent run-up in Bitcoin prices are not incredibly different in that both included telltale signs of "irrational exuberance" and a bubble mentality -- i.e., people over-invested and bought using leverage because they believed that prices would continue to rise indefinitely (and then many people wound up getting caught with their pants down). 
I'd suggest that you Google "tulipmania" -- perhaps you'll find that to be a more apt comparison . . . And that is actually quite similar to Bitcoin insofar as tulips were used during that bubble as currency . . .

Care to actually explain your view? 
Or do you prefer name-calling because you don't actually have any sort of reasoned analysis to back your view and just want to dismiss differing views out-of-hand in the hopes that the irrational exuberance will continue indefinitely -- or at least until you can sell for a profit . . . ?

@_date: 2017-05-27 22:15:34
I'm not saying that Bitcoin is "dead" -- to the contrary, I think Bitcoin remains viable for the same purposes and functions that it has always been viable -- primarily, facilitating transactions and exchanges in the underground economy (e.g., drugs, gambling, and prostitution).  However, the recent run-up was pure speculation and irrational exuberance that created a bubble -- there was no underlying fundamental reason for the price to have doubled aside from FOMO . . .   Thus, the crash back down to more reasonable and sustainable price levels was and is inevitable . . . 
(Note: I say "is" because I still don't think we've hit bottom . . . Reasonable and sustainable price level will be back down to around 1500 in my opinion . . . That may not be the bottom either because the rapid decline may result in prices swinging further than they probably should in the other direction, but I would predict that prices eventually stabilize around that level . . . Time will tell.)

Right but you were suggesting that this run-up in price of Bitcoin is different than tulipmania because Bitcoin serves a functional purpose -- i.e., currency -- whereas tulips do not.  I was explaining to you that at least part of the reason for tulipmania was that the tulips served a functional purpose -- in fact, the same functional purpose as Bitcoin -- i.e., currency.

Coinbase will process the transaction.  Your bank account will be overdrawn and, thus, the transaction will not go through.  Coinbase will cancel the transaction due to insufficient funds, so you will not get the Bitcoin.

The cause you ask? 
The cause of this correction is that the price was based on irrational exuberance -- the price skyrocketed over the course of a couple of days for absolutely no reason other than the fact that fools thought that it was an easy way to get rich quick and bought more than they could afford to lose.  Now price is plunging (as was inevitable) and they are all panicking and trying to get out before they lose their rent money.  People who bought with leverage are also being liquidated because their margin accounts are getting wiped out and they can't cover margin calls. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:22:47
Let me fix this for you: 
Someone who has a long position and, thus, benefits from price rising made up some utter nonsense to try to induce others to buy and add fuel to the rally so that price rises . . .
EDIT: I should probably change "made up some utter nonsense" to "engaged in wild and unsupported speculation" because the comment that you link to isn't actually "leak[ing]" anything -- the commenter doesn't claim to have any actual knowledge of anything as would be necessary for it to be a "leak" but rather is simply speculating wildly . . .

Not sure what exactly he means by no "intrinsic value" . . .  If he means that there's no physical asset and/or revenue stream backing it (like say a stock or a commodity) then sure . . . 
The foregoing admittedly makes Bitcoin a bit different than fiat money, which is backed by governments that have the power to levy and collect taxes (and the ability to raise money by issuing debt . . .)  BUT fiat currency similarly similarly isn't really backed by any physical asset -- we abandoned the gold standard quite a long time ago . . .
Bitcoin does have "intrinsic" value in the sense that it is a store of value and serves a functional purpose -- mainly, facilitating transactions and exchanges in the underground economy --&gt; e.g., drugs, gambling, prostitution . . .  and, in a slightly different category, circumventing government restrictions and burdensome regulations on flows of money . . .  It also has the potential for more widespread adoption in the "above ground" economy, although there are definitely significant impediments to this occurring (namely, the fact that it is so closely associated with the underground economy and governments have incentives to stymie broader adoption because of the fact that it inhibits their traditional control) . . .
In that sense, Bitcoin is similar to gold, art and other items that have long been used to facilitate transactions and exchanges in the underground economy . . .

Not surprising.  The crash isn't going to happen in one day or all at once . . . 
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:06:14
It's all a matter of time-horizon.  If a person has an investment time frame is a year or more then they are probably fine in my opinion.  But there is or was a lot of new money that assumed that prices would keep skyrocketing indefinitely in the short-term and they could double their money in a couple of weeks.  That's not going to happen and lots of those folks are going to get hurt . .

It's dropping because it's a bubble . . . 
It will go back up to $2,800 eventually but not for a reasonably long while . . .
In the short term -- next 30 days -- it will drop below 2,000.
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:42:17
Yep, there's a great book called Irrational Exuberance -- discusses bubbles dating all the way back to Tulipmania . . . 
P.S. does this chart look similar to anything you've seen recently?  
:-) :-) :-)
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:16:24
Depends on your time horizon . . . If you are looking to flip for a profit in the next 30 days (other than literally a quick flip on intraday volatility) then it's a bad time to buy . . . If you are looking to hold for a couple of years then it's probably a perfectly fine time to buy . . .
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:27:44
Well it was really a pretty smart idea yesterday or the day before when prices went haywire . . . Still plenty of downside but there could be some short-term -- particularly intra-day -- pain as holders of long positions and people who believe that the price will continue to soar and/or bounce try to find support for a floor and/or buy at what they think or hope will be the bottom . . . Need to make sure that you don't overbuy short positions and that you have enough capital in your margin account to cover losses during this potential volatility so that you don't become a forced seller (or in this case a buyer to cover the short) through automatic liquidation of your position . . .  As long as you do that, there should definitely be -- in my opinion -- profits over the next 30 days as the price falls and eventually stabilizes at a more sustainable level . . . 
With respect to my last point, read about Amaranth Advisors LLC trader Brian Hunter and his counterparties . . .  In short, a lot of folks wound up being correct but they were unable to cover margin calls and forced to sell their positions prematurely for massive losses . . .

I agree with everything you just said except the following: 
(1) I can't tell if you think that price will drop to $800-900 or if you think price will drop to $1200-1600.  I'm very bearish, but even i think the former is way low and that the low-end of the latter is also probably a bit low. 
(2) The Saudi Arabia add-on at the end is utter nonsense and/or wild speculation.  There is no reason whatsoever to think this is true.  And even if it were true, it would not have a near-term effect and most likely would not have a long-term (durationally) effect on the price of Bitcoin because: (a) the contract that the U.S. and Saudi Arabia signed was just an agreement that Saudi Arabia would purchase -- and the U.S. would agree to permit them to purchase -- X dollar amount of certain types of weapons; the actual contracts with the manufacturers have not been signed -- or even negotiated -- and actual delivery dates are many many many years away . . . and (b) Saudi Arabia would most likely liquidate the Bitcoin received from purchasers into fiat currency rather than hold (or "HODL") long-term. 
(3) I would add to this that the fall you are predicting will be exacerbated and/or fueled by leveraged positions being automatically liquidated, panic by newcomers who bought more than they can afford to lose, and stop loss orders being executed . . .  (Basically the mirror of what I suspect may have contributed to the recent run-up -- i.e., leveraged short positions being liquidated and an influx of newcomers and/or others who can't actually afford to lose the amounts they've bought buying into the herd mentality and thinking that it's an easy way to get rich quick and that the price is guaranteed to continue to rise indefinitely -- the latter was likely fueled, at least in part, by sensationalized media stories discussing how much $X of Bitcoin in Y year would be worth today . . .  But guess what? That's true of many stocks and other commodities . . .)
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:50:35
(1) I'm not trolling -- I'm sharing my prediction and the reasoned analysis supporting it . . .  Also, not spreading fake fear -- people who are overinvested and foolishly assuming that the bubble will continue forever and that they will be able to flip in the short-term should get out before they get hurt . . .  On the other hand, people who have a longer term investment horizon and/or can afford to lose what they've invested should feel free to HODL because I would be inclined to agree that they'll be fine over a longer timeframe of a few years . . . (That doesn't mean, however, that I agree with the fools trying to fuel the irrational exuberance with wild unsupported speculation of prices hitting $10,000 or $1 million in the next year or two . . .  The former *could* happen but it could just as easily go below $500 . . . There's a lot of uncertainty . . .) 
(2) Do you even know how old I am??? I bet you have no clue. 
(3) If you actually believe that we are witnessing a "slow implosion of the obsolete fiat banking monopoly" (as you put it . . .) then you are truly off your rocker . . . The adoption of Bitcoin as a source of payment in the underground economy -- drugs, gambling, prostitution -- and sparse (but admittedly slowly growing and certainly potentially expanding) adoption in the broader economy indicates nothing of he sort . . .
(4) Is it sad that I'm offering reasoned analysis supporting a prediction?  
Or is it sad that you feel the need to resort to name-calling because you're incapable of offering your own reasoned rebuttal? 
Or is it sad that you're concerned that reasoned analysis in support of an alternate view that is at odds with your own might stymie the rally fueled by people investing money they can't afford to lose in the hopes of striking it rich? 
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:12:33
