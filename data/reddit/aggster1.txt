I agree it does seem like we are in price discovery, and unfortunately for now its still a bit high
@_date: 2014-09-16 17:52:14
could be all the stolen gox coins being sold back on the market suppressing the price?
@_date: 2014-09-29 20:52:34
centralisation of pools is an issue, also centralisation with mining farms
@_date: 2014-06-13 05:59:15
see if your still pleased when the price drops 51%
@_date: 2014-08-25 18:25:23
After checking out the client, it looks like its a well implemented decentralised asset exchange, and today its first asset has gone live, hence the price rise.
It seems that its predominantly only catching on in china, and us westerners are late to the game.
I must say that im impressed with the client, and it wouldn't surprise me if the market cap exceeds litecoin very soon
@_date: 2014-10-01 05:47:24
works for me
@_date: 2014-09-14 08:40:44
all the infrastructure is there to support another bubble, but I think it would burst once the transaction limit has been reached, in my opinion it would be be before the price hits $10000
@_date: 2014-08-25 20:37:22
From what ive seen im impressed with bitshares and not surprised at all about its market cap. Personally I expect it to outperform litecoin.
@_date: 2014-07-23 05:47:53
isn't this meant to be mineable?
@_date: 2014-04-27 22:26:27
Back to the minimum wage slave trade!!!
@_date: 2014-12-01 20:40:47
try brawker
@_date: 2014-09-25 05:52:34
Proof of stake consensus or something similar could ultimately take over as mining is costly and as it gets more centralised becomes vunerable as an  attack vector 
@_date: 2014-02-02 18:49:38
Charities could make their own premined altcoin to fund their purposes, if its a good cause, i'd speculate on some
@_date: 2014-01-14 12:59:39
we should be dealing in satoshi's soon
@_date: 2014-02-10 15:02:34
never had any issues like this with other exchanges, other than gox

this woman is nuts, she actually believes that the world is controlled by aliens in the vatican

obviously staged for the gullible out there, but funny

should now be called rise and fall of bitcoin

I purchase a phone from them almost a year ago, only problem was having to pay import tax
@_date: 2014-09-29 13:37:51
I think that bitcoins proof of work mining may be its ultimate demise, as mining becomes more centralised the more it becomes a central point of failure. Does bitcoin have any plans to negate this threat? Will Proof of stake, dpos or something similar be the future?
@_date: 2014-01-08 21:37:22
litecoin mining is the way to go for entry level

I thought the video was boring, Andreas was much more entertaining at the Canadian senate
@_date: 2014-06-12 20:37:44
are they deliberately trying to make the btc price crash?
@_date: 2014-01-22 19:20:37
we see this behaviour regularly in the altcoin market
@_date: 2014-03-14 00:07:03
Thanks for the reply, I agree it would be an ambitious project and prone to corruption.
@_date: 2014-02-07 15:57:16
ive always mined them but ive made my first purchase ever today
@_date: 2014-05-21 11:54:10
not sure this would be practical, my guess is that between planets resources would be traded rather than having a common currency
@_date: 2014-01-18 11:38:34
get some bit coin and spread 20% across decent altcoins
@_date: 2014-01-16 22:17:09
shame if they really wanted to corner the market  they should have created an ebay exchange platform to trade all currencies  in real time

purse.io does not seem to work at the moment for me, but we need another snapcard kind of service where we can buy instantly rather than wait for somebody to make the purchase for me on purse.io
@_date: 2014-11-27 22:00:34
I much prefer brawkers service to this, as they dont require you to upload your bitcoins till someone has agreed to make the purchase for you
@_date: 2014-06-12 21:37:30
Because they have majority control of the mining
@_date: 2014-09-29 19:05:35
If the trend for pow is to become centralised then it will be more susceptible to attack, ie 51% attack or even attacked by government or institutions
@_date: 2014-06-12 20:47:01
with all the fud regarding cex.io ghash I think price will drop to around 400 or less
@_date: 2014-01-23 12:00:02
so much easier swapping altcoins between exchanges
@_date: 2014-01-23 12:14:53
If more companies do this it would help increase adoption of bitcoin
@_date: 2014-10-24 13:03:10
This would be quite profitable, but from what I hear I think that its hard to get money onto btce and costly due to fees, and then same again to withdraw. 
Personally I don't trust exchanges, only put on there what you can afford to lose
@_date: 2015-08-22 00:35:27
managed to retrieve my wallet now thanks
@_date: 2015-08-16 08:39:35
cant we fork reddit?
@_date: 2015-07-16 21:04:50
he could have made a hefty profit if he had invested back in October 2012
@_date: 2015-07-22 16:16:52
my copay app updated and the wallet retrieval would not work and there was no way to roll back the update so unfortunately ive lost my btc, be carefull
@_date: 2018-03-04 18:31:13
Better than giving it to the banksters like every other country 
@_date: 2018-03-04 18:25:49
Im not confident but that would make me very happy
@_date: 2018-04-01 19:07:09
All fiat currencie values are reduced over time due to inflation/money printing, so i cannot see them being the dominant currencies over centuries as you describe
@_date: 2017-05-17 17:26:08
bitcoin needs to fork now
@_date: 2015-10-01 05:47:33
my weekly purchase limit has increased from $500 to $3000, not sure about withdrawels
