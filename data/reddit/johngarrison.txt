In theory that could be possible. But as of now I don't see Bitcoin prices adjusting in reaction to devaluation of the dollar.

I find it very odd that the transaction takes so long to show up. The customer's cell phone and the business' tablet should be connected to bitcoin nodes which are very close to each other in the network, if not being connected to the very same bitcoin nodes. I would have thought the transaction would show up almost instantly.
But then, I suppose with the phone going through cell towers, and the business wifi likely going through land cables, I guess it's possible they are accessing the internet through points "further apart" than one may expect.

If you want to get into mining, and don't have a source of hardware close to the manufacturer, it's probably too late.
Crunching the numbers from the commercially available miners, I have yet to find anything that would reliably even pay for itself.
But for Bitcoin itself overall, yeah there is plenty of room left in this bandwagon. :)

* BTC allow you to make purchases without revealing your banking or other personal information to third parties. As a major corporation reveals a data breech practically every week, this is good news to me. Transactions are usually easier too; more straightforward and quicker. The prices you pay are also likely lower, as the producers you buy from don't have to pay 2-7% fees to the CC companies, etc.
* The "crypto" part of it is what allows the distributed system to work. This is the basis of the proof-of-work system, versus the old trust system.
* Cash back, fraud protection, price matching, and other perks are nothing compared to the benefits of Bitcoin. Those all add up to mere pennies. The fees the old systems cost us are by no means made up for by these perks, not by a long shot. Sure, bitcoins are not FDIC insured. But if the only way your stolen money is "paid back" is due to inflating the currency to replace your money out of thin air, I don't think I'd be calling that a perk.

Continental currency was originally associated with not only criminals, but outright **traitors and terrorists**.
And yet, today the descendent currency - the US dollar - is the de factor world reserve currency deemed the most "respectable".
A currency's associations are meaningless (edit: well, unless it's manipulated). What it can or cannot do, and how it does or does not do so, are all that should be of concern.

I understand your concern, but the devs don't have as much power as one may think. Thousands - possibly tens of thousands - of computer security experts, programmers, and hackers are watching all of their moves very closely, and discussing any potential changes in the protocol very thoroughly.
If the devs try anything suspicious, people will just not update their node clients. Not even the devs can push through an unpopular change.
My main concern is that someone can convince people to change the protocol based on big PR stunts and glitter-glam rather than solid discussion. Although many people keeping an eye on bitcoin are dedicated experts, I fear the majority of nodes are likely controlled by lemmings who will just "autoupdate" without thinking whenever a new version is released. :/

True enough. But unfortunately, the vast majority of people will only think: "I read on Forbes about Bitcoin, and they said..."

No transparency? They've answered any and all inquires, even the intrusive and assholish ones.

When the difficulty jumps, in a way it's not really increasing. The network is already operating at that difficulty, basically. The difficulty number is just jumping up to correct for being "too easy".
I wonder though: Why is the difficulty changed only once every 2016 blocks? I understand the concept of wanting block times to average out; you wouldn't want to change difficulty based on just a handful of blocks, as chance may have made the average finding time of those blocks much lower or higher than the true statistical average for the current difficulty. However, 2016 blocks seems a bit high. Surely 1008 would be sufficient? More frequent and hence gradual changes in difficulty would be better for the bitconomy as a whole, and Bitcoin's PR as well, I'd wager.
Or perhaps there is a statistical reason why 2016 blocks has been deemed appropriate? If so, I wish that was explained somewhere.

Don't get me wrong; I'm bullish on Bitcoin. But the majority of this sub is nothing but people searching for that "high" emotional rush that you get from hitting 3 cherries.
It's a natural human drive. It's the same reason we go shopping, after all, for that little thrill you feel when you find a cool thing.
It's a strong psychological drive, this concept of intermittent reinforcement, which our species needed in the past to encourage continuous foraging and hunting, even if we don't always get a big haul. And continuous attempts at flirting, even when we don't always get laid.
But it's rather tiring to see everyone view a primitive emotional need as some sort of "market wisdom".

I can now buy groceries with Bitcoin, along with many other things via Gyft. My barber and favorite bar accept Bitcoin, as does the garage I usually take my car to. My landlord is looking into it and may soon accept Bitcoin for rent (including utilities).

Yes, I'm one of *those* people. Proudly so.

I'm sure many people will present reasonable reasons. But let me be "that guy".
After income and sales taxes, 1/3-1/2 of your money is gone. If you want to send some money out of the country, there goes another 15-20%. If you want to pay with a credit card, there's another 2-3%. And so on.
I'd rather keep 99% or more of my income by using Bitcoin, than to only be "permitted" the use of 40% of it.
@_date: 2014-08-25 02:50:52
In the majority of cases, waiting for confirmations is a waste of time. The difficulty in pulling off a double-spend is so convoluted and tricky, I don't think waiting for confirmations is worth it unless you're dealing with huge inter-bank or inter-business transfers.
I've made purchases with Bitcoin about a dozen times now, and each time only took a few seconds. I think the longest transaction was about 7 seconds. Most were practically instantaneous.
@_date: 2014-05-04 01:28:27
They only confirm transactions immediately within their own system. Any interaction they make with the standard financial syatem still jumps through the usual hoops.
I have no clue how Colorado pot vending machines work. I doubt there even are any. Sounds illegal for the same reason cigarette vending machines are illegal in most places: no way to confirm the purchaser is of legal age.

You make a good point. The average person's eyes glaze over when Bitcoin comes up, and they struggle to care. I've tried explaining the significance of Bitcoin to people...and get very poor results. The discussion of theoretical benefits just doesn't click with the average person.

Me: "Actually, that QR code makes it even easier. Instead of typing in payment info or passwords or such, I just take a pic of the code with my phone app..."
Them: "... 'Payment accepted'?? That's IT? You're done?"
Me: "Yup. They gave me a discount for using Bitcoin, too. Plus, there was no 10% eBay fee, no 3% visa/mastercard/paypal fee, no waiting 3-4 days for the transaction to clear my bank account, no need to enter personal financial or credit card info for hackers to steal..."

If Bitcoin becomes so widespread as to devalue fiat in that way, then goverments will simply peg their currency to Bitcoin. For instance, the US gov. may simply say "$100 equals 1 millibit".
Things then proceed as usual, for the most part. The only difference would be that they can't easily devalue their currencies anymore. Bitcoin would make everyone honest without Bitcoin having to be used directly by everyone.
Of course, in reality governments would still devalue their currencies, because the chances of everyone demanding their payments in actual Bitcoins would be zero. So, we may very well still have a fractional reserve system of some sort. It would just be - hopefully - a lot more reigned in than it is now.

Trying to preach to the masses won't get you anywhere. You have to *show* them.
Imagine a video/ad/whatever consisting of a conversation between two people, where one is bummed about certain issues with the modern payment system. Hackers have gotten his CC info from companies twice now, so he's wary of typing his card numbers into a website, or even paying his bills via CC. He knows of the "fake CC number" services available, but doesn't trust *that* service either, and bemoans the extra hassle. He uses paypal most of the time, but he's had nightmares dealing with their customer service and his paypal's been hacked before, too. And of course, the dang Fed is ruining his savings on top of it all.
(Or put the shoe on the other foot, and have some business owner complaining about things from his side. Issues like eBay and paypal fees, or visa/MC fees, and the problems with having to securely store customer financial info, and the expense, stress, and legal liability should anything go wrong with it. A side comment on the effect of inflation on their profits wouldn't be remiss.)
Then, the friend says something like "Man, what a headache. If only they/you accepted Bitcoin."
Says the befuddled hair-puller: "Bitcoin?"
"Yeah, the digital currency. Check this out." The friend goes to a website, adds a product to the cart, hits 'pay with Bitcoin', and scans the QR code with her phone. The computer shows: 'Payment accepted. Thank you for your order.'
"That's it?"
"That's it. The data is all encrypted, and there's no personal info for hackers to steal or companies to abuse anyway. And the fees are less than 1% of what those bozos are charging. It's impossible to counterfeit or artificially inflate Bitcoin, to boot." Etc.
On a personal note, I handed out some Bitcoin to family members last year at Christmas. Even though they were genuinely interested as a curiosity, I got a lot of bored looks once I started explaining the benefits. But all I had to do was *show* them Bitcoin in action, and all of a sudden everyone was amazed.

This is a rather light article. All he saying is:
1. If Bitcoin were to replace fiat, then one Bitcoin would have to be worth about $700,000.
2. In order to replace fiat, Bitcoin first needs to become 2.5% of the world's transactions.
The first is just a math conversion. And the second is not given any justification at all. Why is 2.5% the magic number? No clue is given.

All the harping on about it being the biggest thing since the internet is nice and all, but expounding the virtues of something is a sure-fire way to draw critics and naysayers. Just show Bitcoin being used as it naturally would, and human nature will cause most people to accept it as valid.

I think you're misunderstanding me. Yes, I know the "fraction" means that a bank only actually holds a fraction of their outstanding debt/loans in hard assets. And I know that isn't possible with Bitcoin, but again I wasn't talking about companies that match all of their operations with actual bitcoin transactions.
What I said is that I'm concerned about companies that claim to operate in Bitcoins, but cannot actually show proof of their transactions on the blockchain. It would be pretty easy for such a company to keep a ledger of customer accounts, balances, loan accounts, etc. with essentially fake numbers that they shuffle around, unless someone holds them to account and demands evidence that all of their transactions be proven with blockchain evidence.
Such a thing is easy enough for most current bitcoin users to do to convince themselves an organization's actions are legit, but I'm concerned that if Bitcoin gains wide acceptance the vast, *vast* majority of individuals will just open an account with some business that claims to be a bitcoin bank and will take it on faith that their account balances represent actual bitcoins - rather than just made-up fractional reserve numbers in the bank's internal ledger.

This is why I follow a simple algorithm to make a different password for each and every site.
First, I have four general "plain" passwords - one for work stuff, one for financial related sites, one for personal things, and one for random BS - and this is all I need to keep memorized.
But, I don't use any of these passwords plain. For each website, I take a few characters from specific locations in the URL, and add them to within my passwords at certain locations. Thus, I have a unique password for every site, forum, and service I use, and only have to remember four actual passwords (and the algorithm method used, of course).

Well, it'd be pretty easy to avoid the need of a database. There could be a standardized cryptographic algorithm that uses a scanned fingerprint to generate a wallet seed, for example. Whenever you scan the print at a point-of-sale, the little brain inside the scanner re-creates the wallet complete with private keys, and thus can complete the transaction via the Bitcoin network. The device then wipes all local data.
Of course, then you'd be trusting whoever produced the scanner, in that the scanner wouldn't send out your print or other wallet info via the network, and that it did indeed delete irrevocably all local content.
But I don't think that would be too hard. Open source design, coding, and audits/reviews by independent third parties (even just random programmers of the lay public) would help.
You say that is just too much trust? Well, consider this: Any business who used such scanners would be under the utmost pressure to ensure 100% operational transparency and 100% customer privacy. If even a *single* transaction *ever* came under question in such a system, the entire company's business may very well collapse overnight. Would someone actually shop at XYZ store ever again, if it became known that the company was keeping customer's bank details and passwords when there was no operational need to do so? I doubt it.
Or maybe my idea just wouldn't work. My point is you may not necessarily need a database or to trust a central party. Various clever overlay technologies could solve the problem.

Serious question: Isn't there a way to reveal the whole alpha-numeric chain of your MtGox wallet's private key?
It seems to me that the ability of the user to see their private key would be a "must have" feature of any online wallet, at least in this relatively early age of unstable third-party controlled wallets. That way, if there is ever a problem with the service to where you can't get your bitcoins out through their site, you could at least pull them out of that wallet once you have your private key in text form.
Or perhaps MtGox, and other online "wallets" don't actually have dedicated individual wallets for each user. Maybe the users just have accounts, and the service uses its own wallets to complete transactions? Dunno which it is with MtGox.

As an aside, I'll just take the opportunity to remind people that the "rebels" the mainstream media is talking about are actually remnants and supporters of the prior government.

**BTC vs. Cash**: Bitcoins have some of the same vulnerabilities (no recourse if your phone with a wallet app is stolen or hacked, files can be lost in a house fire, etc.). However they are more secure than cash as they are harder for thieves to access (certainly no ATM security risk), and if you create several backups of your wallet the loss problem is minimized. Your bitcoin wallet was stolen? Pull out a backup and transfer funds to a new wallet before the thieves can spend it all.
While relatively few places accept Bitcoin at the moment, that is simply due to the whole newness of it, and not any inherent problem with Bitcoin itself. People used to think Facebook was worthless, because at one point "hardly anyone uses it".
**BTC vs. Debit Card and Direct Debit**: These have similar benefits and similar drawbacks. However, no one can "overdraw" your bitcoins; they can only take out the specific amount you send them. This includes government agencies. :)
**BTC vs. Credit Card**: While the various protections of a credit card are nothing to make light of, they are not free. Card fees, and merchant processing fees (an expense they pass on to you via higher prices), etc. The account numbers and PINs are stolen all the time. While such losses may be "protected", again that is not free. Credit cards also contribute to the entire "culture of debt" which is making our economy so shaky these days. The account can also be frozen or closed by the issuer at any time, screwing you over.
**BTC vs. Paypal**: No contest.
**BTC vs. Direct Transfer**: Direct transfer is not always instant. Unless you're transferring between your own accounts (or perhaps if you and your friend's accounts are within the same bank) it actually takes several workdays - sometimes even up to a week - before the actual transfer of funds between accounts is complete and the person you've paid can make use of those funds. If they can't spend the funds, they haven't really received them, have they? Bitcoin transfers are near instant. In the vast majority of cases, waiting for any confirmations is unnecessary.

You need to grow up a bit. And also be very careful with what you say about Robocoin and Jordon. Defamation lawsuits are a thing.
Late product? So common that it should be expected in any business, much less a start-up. Again: *It should be absolutely expected.* If something ever arrives on time, in any business, it's a frickin' miracle. If you can't afford the resulting expense of potentially several months' delay, you shouldn't have attempted the project.
Rental space in the bar? That was your decision. Your problem. You even started renting several months before the expected delivery. You didn't include a clause in the contract about getting out of it if something happened to change the project's plans? Your fault, not Robocoin's problem.
Hold up at customs? Happens in every business. Someone didn't tell someone else something, and it may take weeks or months to sort out. You decided to pay $2,000 for your own solution instead of waiting for Robocoin's channels to do it? Your decision, your expense.
Price drop of the machine even though you hadn't received yours yet? That's pretty common. That's part of the price you pay for early access.
The product was buggy and hard to work with? Welcome to the world of start-ups.
I will give you that the whole returns mess sounds like a legit gripe, and demonstrates Jordon's immaturity and/or disorganization and/or lack of liquid resources to handle such things. And they probably need more than 1 support person, given Frank's reputation.
But most of your problems don't seem all that out of line, or were created by your own inexperience.
I don't know Jordon and am not associated with Robocoin in any way. I realize this was a bad experience and Robocoin certainly isn't Amazon or Apple, but I feel you really need to pull back on your accusations and frustration.

If there was any regulation, he might get his $275,00 back...but that would mean inflating the currency. Basically, the loss would still be there. But the loss would just be spread out over all users of the currency.
Mt. Gox is certainly still open to legal problems. Someone may even go to jail. People paid them money, and they are failing to provide the promised product or service.
While I agree there is a problem with downvoting negative news or trying to turn every negative thing into a "this is really good news" statement, I got the feeling that this subreddit was well aware of Mt.Gox's problems for many months now. I don't feel bad for anyone who lost their coins.

Statistically, over the long term, just mining by yourself is best. If you must join a pool (for more consistent returns, instead of "feast or famine") I guess you could just pick the one with the least fees (or no fees).
Since GHash.io recent hit the news for having too much of the network, I recommend avoiding them. I'm not even sure they are accepting new miners at the moment anyway, due to the recent bad press.

1. A big company announces they now accept Bitcoin.
2. People with Bitcoin spike their spending.
3. The company, more than likely, immediately converts all received Bitcoins into fiat.
4. The Bitcoin exchange rate drops, due to the sell-off.
Of course, when a company announces taking Bitcoin some people will buy some Bitcoins too. But most of the traffic is likely to come from people who already own Bitcoins. And not everyone who spends their Bitcoins immediately replaces them.

And just because you get a refund when your credit card is stolen doesn't mean the credit card system is better. That lost money has to be made up somewhere; increased fees and interest rates. Personally, if you mishandle your wallet and do something silly like leave it in the hands of a total stranger "trustworthy company", or write your PIN on your debit card, I don't think the company should make that up.

I guess it depends on what you mean by volatility. Changing difficulty 26% in two weeks seems more volatile to me (and the ignorant media and public as a whole) than a 13% change in a week.
Shortening the timeframe would have a benefit: A shorter time during which big miners can take advantage of the lag in difficulty. As it is now, we have frequent blocks being minded in less than 10 minutes, repeatedly. While this is corrected for when the difficulty is changed, having a whole two weeks were blocks are created relatively easily is kind of ramping up the system. I'm not sure if this is really a negative, though the halving of the rewards and the final bitcoins mined will certainly arrive much more quickly.
I agree though, in the end it probably doesn't make much difference. But it would be nice to have a statistical reason for the timeframe which is used. If changing difficulty more frequently has a drawback, maybe decreasing the frequency would be even better? Of course, having low frequency of changing the difficulty would have drawbacks as well.
@_date: 2014-03-12 13:16:40
This just looks like internal accounting movements. I suppose such buy/sell orders could be used to manipulate the market, but I am unaware of the records revealing any such behavior. And of course they sold when bitcoin was bullish; they were in the business of *selling bitcoins*.

There is a big difference between initiation of a technology and "commercially available".
The Internet existed in the 70's. But it wasn't until 1991 that the UI and public hand-holding became developed enough for it to be considered "commercially available".

Unless banking institutions switch over to using Bitcoins and manipulate the market.
The vast majority of people would probably just get their bits through Bank of America or other such shills, thinking that somehow makes them safer. I'm afraid it would be all too easy for banks to show balances in bitcoins on their customer's internal accounts (kind of like a wallet on a web service) without actually holding them in bitcoin addresses on the blockchain.
While many people will know this is would be a suspicious way to do business, I'm afraid most of the lay public (the vast majority of people) would think there's nothing wrong with it.

@_date: 2014-02-26 05:07:30
Here's what I've been telling people:
"One company (out of dozens) that buys and sells bitcoins was verifying their transactions in a sloppy way. Instead of looking directly at the bitcoin balances and verifying that coins had indeed been transferred, the company was just using the presence or absence of a transaction ID number to verify that a transaction went through.
"So what the scamers basically did was buy some bitcoins from the company, but then create fake transaction IDs. They'd go to the company saying "hey, our transaction didn't go through". The company would look at the bitcoin network for the fake transaction ID, would not see it, and so would wrongly assume the transaction didn't go through and so they would send the bitcoins again. Since most of this process was automated, the scammers were able to do it over and over again quite rapidly, and no one at the company noticed something was odd until pretty much all of their bitcoins were gone.
"Most bitcoin trading companies know this is a lazy and risky way to do business, and instead directly verify changes in bitcoin balances as proof of the moving of coins.
"This whole thing was probably a small PR blow for bitcoin because the company that screwed up was one of the earliest bitcoin trading companies, and so its name had media recognition. But Bitcoin itself is unaffected."
This explanation may not be technically correct, but I think it's close enough to what happened while still being easy enough for laypeople to comprehend.
**Edit:** Well, it seems my "simple" explanation is probably still too detailed for what most average people care to hear. had a much better way of explaining it:

1. A big company announces they now accept Bitcoin.
2. Said company, more than likely, doesn't want to actually hold any Bitcoins. They want to immediately convert to fiat.
3. The company's Bitcoin service provider (Coinbase, Bitpay, etc.) suddenly has to start buying up a bunch of coin, paying out fiat to the companies. (Edit: Not everyone who is spending their Bitcoins buy more to replace them.)
4. The Bitcoin exchange rate drops, because a bunch of coins are being sold off. Decreased demand, excess supply.
I suspect the price will continue to drop. If there is a sudden inflection point and widespread adoption begins, there might be a slight increase.
But the big "to the moon" moves probably won't really happen until the companies start paying their own bills in Bitcoin, keeping the ecosystem moving.

Yeah, lost Bitcoins are lost forever. *Just like lost cash.*
And yes, that "credit card BS" *does* apply to customers. Although the payment appears to take seconds from the perspective of the customer, it actually takes an average of 3-4 days (sometimes, up to a week) before the transaction actually clears the network and is finalized in their account.

They are not withholding access really. They're just preventing access via a Tor server. The users can still access their coins fine if they access their wallets via another server (maybe via a VPN, or just straight).
Let's say you rented a home/apartment, and say there was a security camera that had a view of your front door. Not wanting the camera to see and identify you as you come and go, you decide to not use the front door but instead enter/exit via a back window.
Then, the landlord somehow prevents access via the windows. Maybe he was worried this would allow crooks to break in.
Now, it's understandable if you might be upset about the new situation. But you can't reasonably say the landlord is preventing you from accessing your rental, since you can still just go through the front door.

After a half hour of searching though, I don't see any such company listed in any public records. The closest I can find is a "Blockchain Property management Ltd.", which is based in England (just like Blockchain.info), and lists its actions as "real estate agents and managers". Odd.
Unfortunately, the term "blockchain" is not trademarked, so there isn't an easy way to end the problem. A trademark was applied for in July 2013, filed by a "Joseph Page" (who I do not see listed as being on the staff of Blockchain Ltd.), but the application was denied. [Link 1]( [Link 2](

Paper wallets can be passed around and traded for goods and services, just like paper currency. This makes many people comfortable (even though it shouldn't...), and makes bitcoins for the masses easy to use.
At the moment, there are many, **many** more people willing to accept bitcoins in paper form over digital form. Their loss and risk, I agree, but the whole point here is to increase exposure and acceptance.


Not quite true.
About 2 weeks ago I went out into the living room and asked my roommates if they'd accept Bitcoin in exchange for taking over some of my chores. I said I'd help them create a wallet and it'd be quick and easy. None of them took me up on it.
An hour later, I returned to the living room with paper wallets. In five minutes, I had given out four paper wallets and was chore-free for the week.

While I agree with you, that won't stop the bastards.
If they don't get enough taxes to fund their devious schemes, they'll just print more dough (or hit a key on a keyboard and magically make it appear), which has the double effect of basically taxing us by inflation.

True enough. I hope to alleviate this somewhat by (1) actually having several different algorithms, and their use is based on a factor other than the type of base password, and (2) minimizing my number of online accounts as much as possible. Of course,  has it's own problems (using a Facebook login for nearly everything would be pretty flippant, for example).
Still, all of your points still apply. I have problems trusting password managers though (maybe unwarranted paranoia that they are leaking data). I also use many company-owned and public-use computers, so I'm not sure how often I could even have the option of using a password manager.

The problem with this analysis, and many others, is that it assumes everyone will be using Bitcoin. That using Bitcoins is just as easy as fiat or gold use.
Sure, a Bitcoin is *theoretically* quite valuable if you assume it will eventually reach widespread integration, but the same would be true of craft beads or stone discs. This theoretical value also makes the unspoken assumption that Bitcoin will eventually push out all other currency options. While that could happen, it's a rosy, dreamy assumption, to say the least.
If you want to buy something, the chances the other party will accept Bitcoin are similar to randomly throwing a rock in the air blindfolded and happening to clip a passing bird. Sure, the number of people using it are growing, but I honestly don't see much pressure for this to become as ubiquitous as fiat systems currently are.
It's a Catch-22. Bitcoin would have incredible monetary value if it were more widely accepted. But it only has a chance of becoming widely accepted if it first becomes more valuable from a utilization standpoint. And achieving that will be hard. After all, the vast majority of people are complacent with the government taking 25-30% of their paychecks, with nary a second thought. How many hoops is the average person willing to jump through to save 3% on transaction fees? Pretty much none.
I suspect this increase in value (value of utility I mean, not just numerical value) will eventually come, once Bitcoin systems are developed to make interacting with the network just as smooth and simple as people can work with fiat today. If Bitcoin-related systems can't reach a point where people just swipe a card and punch in a PIN, it has pretty much zilch chance of approaching even the most conservative estimate of value.
**tl;dr:** An asset's value is partially based upon its ease of use. A 1-kilo bar of gold is theoretically quite valuable, but if you're trying to buy groceries or fill up your car, it's true value collapses.

**One**: Why does the claimed "4 business days" never pan out? In the latest instance, I bought some bitcoins 3 business days ago. My account says they won't be credited to my balance for 5 *additional*  business days. What gives?
**Two**: When simply trading coins on the Bitcoin network, why does my Coinbase wallet require more than 6 authentications? I once had to wait 3 days before my account allowed me to spend my bitcoins (bitcoins which had taken over a week to arrive in my account in the first place, I might add).
**Three**: Why do these slow-downs in delivery always exacerbate when the bitcoin price is rising? Is it because you run out of Bitcoins in the buying frenzy and have to wait to fill your orders with the trickle of incoming bitcoin sells, or are you holding the coins as long as possible to profit the most from the price rise? Either way is innconvenient and annoying.

Vending machine integration. The machines already have plug-n-play hardware inserts for accepting credit cards, which clear the transaction and send an "okay to sell" signal to the machine. Could this same device have a small bitcoin-network-sniffer, which continuously surveys an address for which the QRC code is plastered to the front of the machine? If sufficient funds are sent to that address, then for the next 30 seconds the machine gets the "okay to vend" signal; after which (or after the purchase, if unspent funds remain) the balance is returned to the source address.

"Useful" depends on your goal.
If you tell the average person it only costs 0.0001 bitcoin to make a transfer, they're going to not have any clue what you're talking about, and ignore you.
If you tell them it costs five cents versus hundreds of dollars to make a huge transfer, that grabs their attention and gets the point across.
Hence, a useful point of comparison between dollars and bitcoins.

I'm having trouble being upset with them though. The world of physical product production has so many unknowns, I personally think it's a miracle they went from zero to shipping in just 6-7 months.
As you say, bitcoin mining is a very time-sensitive matter. I suspect miners are acutely aware of that...which makes me wonder why they continue to pay for rigs at all. There are just so many unknowns, the chances of receiving something late are always going to be there, no matter the company.
I just feel that it's obvious one is making a big gamble whenever you put an order in for mining equipment. Even if it is delivered exactly on time and is to the exact expected specifications, the network could have changed enough to where it'd be the same as a late delivery.

That's only on a full-year basis, which is very convenient for your statement but also highly misleading considering bitcoin's move to wide public awareness was less than a year ago.

I've had my credit card info stolen 3 times in the past 5 years. Target hack. Jimmy John's hack. I forget the other.
The funds were returned, sure. But I had my account frozen each time and had to go without a card until they issued me a replacement. One time this took nearly two weeks. I had to make a dozen formerly automatic payments manually with my debit card, and this hassle and chaos led to a few payments not going through, and I got hit with fees for those. A royal pain in the ass. Then a few months later hackers struck again and I had to go through the whole mess again.
Plus, those waived charges the credit card company takes care of aren't just magically gone. The stolen money has to be made up somehow. Do you think a bank that has hundreds of thousands of credit cards compromised, and has to write off god knows how many dollars in fraudulent charges, and has to physically replace those hundreds of thousands of cards, won't increase its fees and interest rates as a result?
@_date: 2014-05-01 13:50:43
There is nothing special about the yearly change. It's not a magic time frame that dictates the benefit or detriment of something.
It's only a standard financial measurement because 1 year is convenient to mentally conceptualize, and the majority of investments and currencies have existed long enough to where their records can be reasonably compared by such a division.
In the case of bitcoin - or anything which has a sudden and dramatic change lasting only a few months then levels out to a new norm - I think something as simple as the change over the past year is misleading.

@_date: 2014-01-07 19:48:30
You are not dealing with the bitcoin network anymore, but with standard banking networks.
There have been only 5 full business days since you initiated the transaction. A delay of that long, or even up to a week, is quite normal when you're talking about moving funds from one bank account to another.
Swiping a credit/debit card is by no means instant. This is one example I use when people complain about the "delay" for verification on bitcoin; it is actually much, much faster than traditional bank fund movements.

I find it implausible that someone with the tech know-how to be an "early adopter" and miner wouldn't have all of his bitcoins with a third party.
I mean, presumably he had a private wallet on his own computer he was mining with. Did he just send them all to Gox? I suppose if his plan was to daytrade then maybe.
@_date: 2014-03-13 15:01:32
I didn't explain as much as I should have. I was thinking that, since Gox doesn't have control over user's private wallets, that instead of transferring bitcoins between wallets they must first pass through a Gox account. When I see a Gox account only "selling" bitcoins, I assumed it was just the way the system was set up to distribute sold coins.
@_date: 2014-02-06 14:28:05
Huh. If people can't spend their MtGox bitcoins, aren't they effectively out of circulation? Wouldn't that massive reduction in supply cause a huge surge in demand, and make the price go *up*?
Of course, for many people MtGox may be their best (or only) way to trade in bitcoin, so if MtGox collapses many people may just cash out their coins for fiat, thus downing the exchange rate.
@_date: 2014-02-06 14:30:47
I suppose for many people, MtGox is the only way they want to trade bitcoins. If it closes its doors, such people will probably just cash out their coins, which yeah would probably drop the price.
But if MtGox simply vanishes, and takes who knows how many millions of coins with it, the sudden massive drop in Bitcoin supply may cause a huge *increase* in their value. Maybe? Dunno.

If that "discount" comes merely due to the increased value of your bitcoins compared to what they cost you when you bought them, that is hardly something to trumpet as an inherent benefit of the bitcoin network.

The more people who use bitcoin, the more anonymous it will become.
You only lose the anonymity when your bitcoin transactions interact with the traditional banking system. If you get paid for services, pay your bills, and buy your groceries all in bitcoin, they'd have to do some serious investigation to identify you.
And even then, I think they'd only ID you on a single transaction-by-transaction basis; tying multiple transactions to a single person based on the blockchain would rely on strictly circumstantial evidence.
@_date: 2014-07-13 18:04:40

@_date: 2014-02-07 04:25:46
Not sure what you mean. If you were to spend the bitcoins by using the private key on another computer, for example, then your wallet on the 3rd party site would almost instantly update the address balance to the new totals, right?
If you tried to spend the same bitcoins from multiple computers at once, you might fool part of the network for a little while, but eventually only one of the transactions will become accepted and added permanently to the blockchain, right? I guess the only danger then would be for people you pay to who don't wait for enough confirmations...
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:22:12
What are you using to determine your exchange rate?
At the moment the site says "$25 for 0.0292 Bitcoin". That's quite pricy. At this same moment, $25 on Coinbase will get me about 0.0371 Bitcoin.
That's nearly a **27% markup** you've got going on.
Sorry, but even for a convenience service that's pretty crazy.

1) Do not use Bitcoin-qt. It's too easy to screw up as a newbie. (I recommend a deterministic wallet to people instead.)
2) If you want to spend coins from a paper wallet or other cold storage method, import the entire balance into an electronic wallet, then destroy the paper wallet and never use it again.
This advice certainly isn't perfect or comprehensive, but it seems to be just enough info for a newbie to grasp and remember without getting overwhelmed, while giving them a good chunk of protection.

Nice analogy.
I think this would be a good time to point out that if you import a paper/cold wallet to a digital client you should import the entire balance at once, otherwise all of the change will go towards the miners as a tip!
This is probably less of a problem these days, as I think nearly all modern clients automatically move in all bitcoins from whatever cold address you import.

I think theft is a bad thing.
If I would have to pay a $5 toll if I wanted to use a certain private highway, and later on that day decide to give another $5 to a charity in line with my beliefs and which has proven to me that it is trustworthy, all well and good.
But let's say a bizzare mugger holds me up for $30, then gives $3 to the manager of a road which may or may not be useful to me or many other people, another $2 to a charity which may or may not be reliable and of which many people may or may not approve, spends another $10 on misc stuff I have no interest in (or may even strongly oppose), and then pockets the rest for himself.

Is it because they're a few weeks late in delivery? That seems mostly due to awaiting FCC approval, hardly their fault. Is it because of the higher than expected power consumption of the units? A 20% increase is disappointing, but true-life hardware production is always going to be different than what was anticipated on paper. And in the world of Bitcoin miners, they don't have the luxury of going through several prototype hardware iterations.

But sponsor a bowl game, and suddenly tens of millions of people become aware of Bitcoin and psychologically legitimize it. I feel the best way to support Bitcoin at this time is to help it gain widespread recognition. All the other benefits (including Africa, Asia, and Latin America) will then follow much easier.

I've always thought the transaction ID was superfluous. The realization that some systems were relying on it is simply shocking. I used to defend MtGox, but their lazy practices are certainly deserving of their current downfall.

My theory:
Many people who buy Bitcoin read about it a lot at first, but after a while of nothing exciting happening they don't think about it much and it just sits there while they go about their other business.
Then, when something reminds them about Bitcoins - such as the recent increase in Bitcoin-related news - such casual to-dippers look into their wallets and think to themselves "Eh, I'm not really using it. It's not doing anything terribly exciting right now. I may as well just sell it and get the cash."
As it just so happens, this increase in news stories about Bitcoin occurred when the price was near a psychological barrier of a "even hundred" mark. The casual sells which occurred thus likely tripped a lot of stop-loss bots, which drove the price down more. This in turn caused more casual Bitcoiners to decide to sell, and so on.
@_date: 2014-01-15 22:43:55

Transactions are still going through, pretty recently. It's like they're sending out fractions of bitcoins as soon as they get any bitcoins in.
Is this why MtGox is having such delay problems? Are their bitcoin holdings dried up?
If so, I suppose this would correct naturally. The more problems people have getting their coins out, the more people will cash out their coins, thus fixing the problem.
Unless...unless MtGox blew all its fiat on Alpha Black Lotuses and doesn't have much money available with which to buy back bitcoins... :/

Your first two sentences summarize this whole issue much better than anyone else I've seen do. So thanks.
I disagree on seeing this as the protocol goofing up though. It's been known for years that the transactions IDs are not unique, so I fully blame the exchanges and major market places who should have been well aware of this issue yet nevertheless decided to rely on transaction IDs.
@_date: 2014-10-05 15:09:25
The printed number might not be updated, but that's why the address code is right there. No one should accept a paper wallet as payment for anything without first verifying the balance of the address, which today is quick and easy with a smartphone.
Although you and I might not use paper wallets this way, the idea is that these could be passed around like currency. That is a way of use much more understandable and palatable to the average member of the public.
I agree they are less than ideal though. Even if the private key were secured inside the card somehow, you can never be 100% certain that whoever made the card isn't going to empty the address without notice...  So yeah, these cards are neat but have limited utility.

I suspect that the "missing" fiat was never there. Just as presumably hackers were able to trick MtGox's system into repeatedly sending bitcoins, I would not be surprised if the MtGox software was also lazy when it came to confirming transfers of fiat.

In theory, anyone could make changes and distribute their new version of the protocol. Whether or not those changes take hold would depend on how many people can be convinced to make the change, and unless the changes have been openly discussed and debated and commented on by experts for a while, very few people are going to accept a proposed change.

A very important topic that doesn't get discussed enough.
Despite Bitcoin's strengths, any eventual widespread acceptance will likely be through intermediary companies who offer more user-friendly interfaces. This opens a lot of avenues for misuse.
I could see a company coming into existence, for example, which doesn't actually manage wallets and addresses that can be checked against the blockchain but rather merely keeps an internal ledger of customer "account" balances. While that would be obviously a big red flag for anyone who knows anything about bitcoin (because such a company could easily be doing the old fractional reserve magic trick), I'm afraid the vast majority of the public wouldn't be the wiser.
Or maybe I'm worried over nothing. The public is fickle and easily led by emotion. If there were such a shady business, there would be enough public bad word against it from those in the know that the majority of rubes would probably avoid it as well.

I wasn't directing my comments at Adrian per se, but rather Coinbase as a whole. But even if I was aiming at Adrian, just because he might be risking his job and trying to provide information doesn't suddenly make his actions righteous and immune to criticism.
In fact, my reaction to his statements make it clear that his "helpful" attempts might actually be *harming* Coinbase, in which case he should do the right thing and shut up.
And, even though their announcements and limited release of information may make sense from a business perspective, that doesn't make their statements any more comforting - any less disconcerting.

This is a great read, but for the average member of the public it is too complex. Whenever I introduce someone to bitcoin, I tell them a few things to help avoid most of these problems:
1) Do not use Bitcoin-qt. It's too easy to screw up as a newbie. (I recommend a deterministic wallet to them.)
2) If you want to spend coins from a paper wallet or other cold storage method, import *the entire balance* into an electronic wallet, then destroy the paper wallet and never use it again.
This advice certainly isn't perfect or comprehensive, but it seems to be just enough info for a newbie to grasp and remember without getting overwhelmed, while giving them a good chunk of protection. If they wind up being more interested in bitcoin they can learn more on their own later.

I don't think that's the "primary" purpose of government.
Why would anyone invade a country without a government? The simple fact a country has a government is what makes it a realistic possibility it could be taken over. All an attacker would have to do is fight a few thousand soldiers and take over the seat of government. Then they instantly have a country-wide system already in place which they can use to control the populace. Of course there will likely be some pockets of resistance for a while, but the majority of citizens will simply follow the orders of their local police departments and military personnel.
If a country doesn't have a government, then anyone who wants to take it over would suddenly have to fight and win over every single person in that country. They wouldn't be fighting just a few ten thousand soldiers, but potentially tens of millions or hundreds of millions (or even a billion) citizens. And every single step of conquest would be hard-won; there wouldn't be any targeted goals or hand-holds with which the invaders could claim ownership over the country.

They lived in close-knit communities of 50-150 people, had a ton of fun and downtime, and had deep meaning. Sure, sometimes there was famine. And sometimes there was war with a neighboring tribe. And life expectancy was low. But that doesn't mean they were in constant suffering and misery. And they had all the "rights" they needed; those they could assert.
I find your blind faith in the miracle of government to be delusional. But whatever soothes you.


Yes, but there is a huge difference between stopping someone from actively harming the group, and preemptively forcing everyone to follow your "one true way".


I'm not sure if you're trolling here. There is no unclaimed land left. And contesting government's ownership sounds suspiciously like suicide.

No, I'm not overly optimistic in people's ability to do good.
A perfectly libertarian society would not work with the massive overpopulation we have today, I agree. If government fell, there would be a pretty terrible transition period during which billions would die.
That doesn't mean the current society is better than one without government. Only that a transition would be painful.
I don't think there is any legit way for the group to improve other than such obliteration. Those who believe that "government is the answer" are simply lying to themselves, to avoid the pain of having to potentially face a population collapse.

I would far prefer to spend the bitcoins at these businesses directly, and sometimes fear that by just being happy enough going through Gyft, I'm not applying as much pressure as I could be on these companies to start accepting Bitcoin.
But I suppose I could contact some of them, and say things like: "I've been spending bitcoins on Gyft cards for your business, but I'd prefer to spend my bitcoins in your store directly."

Have paid for all of my Starbucks purchases in the past 2 years via giftcards bought with bitcoins. Granted, I only visit Starbucks about once every two or three months. But still. :P
Just bought myself a $50 gift card to home depot, since I'll be going there sometime this week to some stuff to re-caulk my bathroom.

You can't just assume more people are going to visit the moon, just because it would be true *if* more countries decided to visit it. It entirely depends on whether they do.
So, you can't just assume the bitcoin price is going to go up, just because it would *if* there was increased adoption.
You might as well be trying to convince people to invest in chocolate-covered grasshopper snacks. Because, after all, that niche market would explode and become quite a cash cow for anyone set up to fulfill that demand... *if* adoption increases and a bunch of people suddenly demand chocolatey insects.

Insignificant ones. And they're optional, actually.


You don't need to understand the technical aspects of bitcoin to use it, any more than you need to understand how TCP/IP works to browse for cat pictures.
You can download an app or a desktop client to do simple bitcoin transactions. It's no more of a learning curve than learning how to write checks is.


(In regards to security)
There are no security risks in the transfer process, is what OP meant. No intercepted faxes. No forms lost in the mail or having your personal info stripped from. No convoluted transfer process that passes through a dozen people's hands, at each point of which your information could be compromised, misrepresented, or otherwise interfered with.


Welcome to the real world. Nothing is a panacea for anything. But if you were 100% completely up front about all of Bitcoin's little quirks the very first instant you try to inform someone about it, what will happen? Zero interest. You have to get people's attention first, and to do that *everyone* trying to convince anyone of *anything* will be at least a little "disingenuous" according to your definition. At least Bitcoin is vastly superior to the current banking system in most ways.
When you're asking someone out on a date, do you immediately rattle off every last problem, hang-up, and personality quirk you have, in the interest of not being "disingenuous"?

They don't necessarily have to.
1) The simple fact that it's explicitly "forbidden" will dissuade many people from doing it. Sheep are sheep.
2) If the bank is robbed, or the vault catches fire, or your box contents are otherwise stolen or destroyed, they (or their insurance) won't have to reimburse you for your cash, since you weren't supposed to have cash in there.
**Edit:** 3) A rather nefarious possibility: They could go through everyone's boxes and confiscate any cash. It's unlikely, sure. But if someone complains their cash is missing the bank has several strong arguments. First off, there was no record of the cash being in the box. And second, the box owner, by keeping the box account open despite these changes in policy, thereby agreed never to have cash in there anyway. The charges of theft might just be seen as some attempt at the box holder to try to scam the bank.

For the same reason they learned to use email? And drive a car? And search the internet instead of relying on encyclopedias and libraries? In short, to better their lives?
And you don't have to learn the technical aspects of the bitcoin protocol in order to use it any more than you have to understand TCP/IP to browse for cat pictures. Just download an app or PC client, and away you go. The learning curve isn't much harder than learning how to use a checking or brokerage account, and much more secure.

Six European powers have now declared Bitcoin to be a currency, not a commodity. The UK, Germany, France, and Spain are also major economic powerhouses in the region.
With a precedent like that in place, the possibility that any other country will come to a different decision becomes less and less likely.

Very nice. Hopefully people don't get scammed by an altcoin masquerading as Bitcoin though.
I could see some nefarious person setting up an altcoin, calling it "bitcoin", and selling coins to the unbanked at Bitcoin exchange prices. Sure, the altcoin system might work for them, but likely won't be supported nearly as well and won't interact with the global Bitcoin network.

You might say: "So what? Even if they all started using Bitcoin, how would that help us all?"

By that, do you mean the limited number of Satoshi's available?
Couldn't the core developers change that, if need be? I mean, in the wildest scenario where Bitcoin replaces all fiat and becomes the single global currency, a single Satoshi would be worth far too much to spend on anything cheaper than a restaurant meal. At that point, they'd kind of have to change the number of decimals just to keep Bitcoin useful as a medium of exchange, no?

@_date: 2013-10-14 13:47:33
If you order a bunch of bitcoins, then pull out the funds from your bank account before the transaction clears (2-3 days, sometimes as long as a week) then Coinbase rightfully gets mad. They can attempt to send it through again, and again, or even undertake civil or criminal collection proceedings. But why should they bother with all that hassle? Especially since they need the money sooner rather than later, to keep their business operating.
So, if someone "writes a hot check" so to speak, Coinbase can just charge their credit card and move on with life. All the problems of nonpayment move to the CC company. Sure, your credit card could have insufficient funds too, but having at least one fallback is better than nothing.
I personally wish Coinbase had not made this change. But oh well. Buying BTC direct from individuals is more private anyway.

Sure, it's very possible. But the fact that Bitcoin was first to gain big traction is a huge factor that will be extremely difficult to overcome competitively, even if a new cryptocurrency arrives that is technically better.
Edit: And, even if a new cryptocurrency supercceeds Bitcoin, I suspect the option will exist to convert your Bitcoins to the new currency. :)

1) Many wallet clients, including the "default" put out by the folks at bitcoin.org, have an option to encrypt the wallet. Unless you have a ton of money assigned to a single address, this will be enough security for the vast majority of Bitcoin users. (This is one reason to use multiple addresses; some people go so far as to use a different address for every single transaction they make. While anyone can freely see how many bitcoins are associated with a specific address, as I understand it no one can see what wallet holds which addresses.)
2) See my other reply.
3) I use BitInstant to buy my Bitcoins. Very easy and painless. Go to their website, give a name and birthdate (I made mine up), print out the form, walk into a WalMart, CVS Pharmacy, or other MoneyGram agent, and send off the MoneyGram with cash. You have to give a name, phone number and address, but again I just make these up. I've never been asked for ID. Only a $3.95 fee to do this (might be a bit higher if you make a large purchase), and my bitcoins showed up in my wallet almost instantly. One drawback is that there is a per-transaction dollar limit (I think $500 or so), so if you want to buy more than that it will need to be in separate MoneyGrams, each with their own fee. Still seems like a great system to me, and way easy.
4.) Yes, these points of complexity are currently serving as ways to deal with inherent faults in the system. I think most will get ironed out, but I agree they need to be squared away quickly or Bitcoin will lose momentum and flounder.

This is why I think difficulty should be adjusted twice as often, after every 1,008 blocks.
Changing difficulty every two weeks was fine in the infant days, but now is just stupid.
But I'm no expert on the protocol. Can anyone offer any explanation as to why a shorter period between difficulty adjustments would be undesirable?

Only if the hashrate keeps growing that fast. I suspect the gigantic splurge of hashpower in recent months is mostly due to many people finally getting their ASIC miners. Once the majority of those orders are filled, I suspect the growth to level off until some new technology allows for even more powerful machines. I hear new orders for ASIC miners are already collapsing, as people see the sudden jump in hashrate and figure that joining the game now would be a loosing move.

The odds of losing the $2 are miniscule. As I understand it, the nodes that receive the transaction will continue to broadcast it until they see a block posted on the chain that includes the transaction. As long as the business is connected to several nodes, instead of say just one, the transaction should be well enough propagated into the network. Is it possible that the $2 is sometimes lost? Honestly I can't answer. But after 3 months of reading the code and learning about bitcoin I can't think of any reason why a transaction would ever get dropped, as long as the nodes propagating it stay online until it does get cleared.

It's not a public message. It's more like slipping an envelope of cash under someone's front door.

Seven hours is nothing. We forget that all of these "instant" transactions we expect in our daily lives are not instant at all, but really micro-loans made between institutions. It often takes several days after your purchase with a debit or credit card, for example, to actually clear all the bank-hopping required behind the scenes.
Eventually, once the bitcoin system becomes better integrated into the world financial systems at large, I suspect we will have the luxury of transferring in or out of bitcoins psudo-quick as well.

If the tax man will never accept bitcoins, so what? As long as there is a bitcoin economy of any sort, someone will convert your bitcoins into dollars which you can then use to pay the tax man. Or, more simply, businesses such as today's tax service companies will pay your taxes in dollars, and you simply pay them the equivalent in bitcoins (plus a little extra as a convenience fee of course).
Many American expatriates don't own dollars. Yet they still need to pay US taxes, which they simply send through an intermediary who does the converting to US dollars for them.
As long as there is any sort of bitcoin economy, the question of taxes shouldn't be a problem.
And, I disagree that bitcoins aren't worth anything. Their security and ease of use are their worth. The fact that the federal government has publically announced it has no problem with bitcoins and **has no authority over them**, is a huge point of their value.
If I start up a small business and only accept bitcoins as payment, I basically don't have to pay income tax. When I buy things with bitcoins, it's quite possible I would pay no sales tax. If I die and leave my fortune to my heirs, there would be no inheritance tax.
Many financial assets would be "off the books". And, it would be in an entirely legal manner. In today's world where people can lose 1/3 to 1/2 of their money via taxes, or even more via bank confiscation, that makes bitcoin worth something to many people. There are many reasons to own bitcoins. They can even pay your taxes.

Hard to argue with any of that in principle. Where it starts to bother me is...well, let's say me and a group of family and friends - say 50 of us - go find a patch of unused wilderness and spend a few years building homes, setting up crops, etc. and in general building a sustainable life for ourselves. Then, an equal sized group of about 50 anarchist socialists move out to the same area, and demand that "it's only fair" for us to give them half of the plot of land.
Some go even further, saying that we should give them half of the homes we've built and half of the crops growing that season. After all, it's not like we created those homes or crops, we stole the raw materials from the communal property which is the planet!
Of course, that's kind of extreme and I realize there are likely different shades of gray in the anarchist socialist perspective...
**Edit:** While I understand and accept it might be fair to give up half our worked land - if indeed the newcomers need it - eventually you reach a point where limited resources can't be reasonably divided up any further. As more and more of the biomass of the planet becomes integrated into human bodies, at some point you find a situation where you have to choose between either accepting some inequality, or having everyone suffering and trying to console yourself by saying "well, at least we're all suffering equally". :P
The latter situation won't happen. No matter how fair human beings wish themselves to be, when the hunger and lack of other resources kick in there is going to be strong resistance to sharing, even violently so.

Error. I got the number from [Blockchain.info]( but it turns out they were using a very old estimation of efficiency: 350 watts per G/H, like the GPUs, instead of the much lower energy ASICs.
So, forget about the massive losses. I still think many miners are making much less than they expected to though.

If I had a brick-and-mortar shop, I would mount this atop my cash register, wired to a tablet or something to control the image. If someone wants to pay with Bitcoin at my shop, they could just scan the address QR that faces them atop the register.

I'm afraid I don't know too much more. Thanks for making me realize I should investigate some other options, such as truecrypt.
As it is, I am going for the "eggs and baskets approach", and keep my bitcoins split between 4 locations: BTC China, Coinbase, Bitcoin-QT, and a paper wallet. If something offers 2-part verification or encryption or some other added security, I make sure it's activated. And of course, back ups!
I can't deposit or withdraw with fiat currency on the BTC China account because I don't have a Chinese bank account, but by signing up for a free account I can still store bitcoins there. I suspect some other online exchanges may also allow opening a bitcoin-holding account without ID, while others may require bank info before you can do anything. I went with BTC China in the off chance that holding some of my bitcoins outside the USA may somewhat protect them from American regulators.
As far as creating new addresses for receiving, I do so only if I've received a decent amount through that address. For example, when I bought 2 BTC on Coinbase I received them on two different addresses, and I plan to never use those addresses again. Meanwhile, I have a payment address to receive coins if someone wants to buy something from me on my website, but those values are so low that I won't bother changing that address for a long while. The overall idea is that I don't want people to see an address with a large balance and be tempted to hack me. Since no one knows that all these addresses belong to a single wallet, I hope that breaking up my coins like this helps reduce the risk. If someone were to send me a huge mass of coins, I would break it up by sending bits to myself at different addresses.
This might only be an issue with online wallets though. I don't know how a hacker could attack your bitcoin-qt if they knew you had a bunch of coins. As far as I know, they'd have to plant a trojan or spyware on your home computer but I don't know how they would ever figure out who owns the target address to begin with. I suppose if you ever cashed out from an address and they had friends at the exchange to tell them your financial info, they could work back from that and target your home computer somehow...but I doubt they'd go to that degree of work unless the potential rewards were huge.
Sorry. Rambling. One last thing though, is that I'm not sure what you mean by generating a new address when you send.

Your bank reports all incoming activity to the IRS. If you have deposits in a single year totally more than $800 from sources other than employment income the IRS knows about, they may get curious enough to investigate you if you do not report that extra income on your tax forms.
So, I would not worry too much about it. Just don't blow it all, as once you report the income as taxes next April you may have to use 10-35% of it to pay the tax (assuming it's taxed like normal income...I have no idea if that is the case).
If you're talking like $3,000 or more, that might cause the bank to file a "suspicious activity report", but they usually don't investigate all of those. Even if you deposited a million dollars, I see no reason to worry as long as you plan to pay taxes on it. Just be honest should anyone question you.
**Edit:** Some other comment reminded me that you're supposed to pay the taxes quarterly, so yeah I guess you may get even more fees if you wait until April to report it all.

Well, Wal-Mart allowed the system to be accepted anyway, resulting in many double-spend transactions.

@_date: 2013-11-07 13:24:22


Maybe not. But I'm worried that there are many miners who spent thousands of dollars on a machine because they expected XYZ income rate, only to discover that they can't make that anymore due to increased network hashrate/difficulty. How many people can afford to sink thousands of dollars like that? I would sell sell sell my hardware as fast as possible before people realize how rapidly their value depreciates, and hope that I could make back even half of what I paid for the thing. If I could not afford to lose that kind of money, I may have to sell some assets to financially recover from the loss.
But maybe there isn't a problem. Maybe enough of the network is run by deep pockets that won't panic and can afford to lose big now in the hope for some eventual profits decades from now. I'm not sure how they can justify that though.
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:29:46
If the difficulty and hashrate rise fast enough, perhaps they will never make their money back.
I have a tiny ASIC miner (336 Megahash) which I bought a month or so ago for $32. When I bought it, I calculated it would make me around $4 a week. Cute and fun! Not gonna make me rich, but after 10 months or so it would pay itself off. Unfortunately, by the time it arrived just three days later, the difficulty and hashrate had jumped to where it was only making $1.16 a week. The next week, it made less than 50 cents. Today, it's around 6 cents a week; I would have to run my computer and the mining chip 24/7 for a full month to make a quarter. At that rate, it will take 10 years and 9 months to pay itself off. And of course, the difficulty will change many times and quite dramatically; that 25 cents per month is not going to last long. If a month can reduce my profit rate from $4/week to 6 cents a week, what is next month going to do?
My mining chip will never pay itself off. No one will buy it for anything but pennies. It just sits idle; the above measurements didn't even factor in the electric cost and wear and tear costs of keeping my computer running 24/7. I realize the numbers are less dire for the larger, legit mining rigs. But with such exponential drop-off in profits I find it hard to believe there are no problems.

One point of reference I like to use is that, over the past few generations, inflation has roughly doubled the dollar price of goods roughly every 20 years. By that measure, in approximately 30 years (2043) what we today conceive as $50,000 may purchase the equivalent of what today costs roughly $20,250. Certainly not a luxury car, but a pretty solid car nonetheless. If I can have a 20k car thirty years from now simply by buying one bitcoin today at about $143, I call that a deal.

Near Field Communications (NFC) technology will change everything.
Many point-of-purchase debit/credit card readers are already set up to accept this. Many smartphones made today are already set up to transmit/receive this. Apple is rumored to be planning to go live with their iPhone version sometime this year, possibly in just a few months.
Add in a simple app that lets you work with your Bit-wallet, and voila:
I predict that, at maximum 2-3 years from today, you will be able to use Bitcoin to buy your groceries, your gas, your dry cleaning, etc. etc.  It might even be possible for this to come before the end of this calendar year.
Why will average people bother to use Bitcoins like this instead of just linking the NFC to their standard bank accounts? Mostly, because this way you won't have dozens of different businesses storing your financial records. The risk of identity theft or debit/credit fraud suddenly drops significantly. For those who care about further privacy, nor will the businesses, the banks, or the government be able to track your purchase history.

Foreigners have to provide a passport number. I haven't decided yet if I will give them my real number, or a fake.
I suspect a fake will be fine, as they are probably just keeping records to cover their asses in case they have to report things in the future.
**Edit:** Just did it. Put in a fake USA passport number, and got my account unlocked. Then I got those BTC out of China! I suspect that any 9-digit number would work (or whatever length your own country's passports use). I seriously doubt that this will bite me in the ass later in life, but I suppose I should mention that possibility. If BTC China has to turn over all of its info to the government, and you ever visit China, I suppose there is a remote possibility your name may come up as flagged with a "different" passport number.

I think you're making too big of jumps and assumptions. I see no reason confidence will be shaken in a business which temporarily runs out of product due to sudden rapid demand.
Even if Coinbase does close, I don't see how that would crash Bitcoin. Coinbase isn't even an exchange.
And although I'm sure plenty of people think the dollar is doomed, I'm pretty sure the sudden surge in bitcoin interest is more due to a desire to make a lot of money than it is to avoid the dollar's downfall.

Allowing "instant transfers" based just on your bank account is risky for Coinbase. You could order BTC from Coinbase, receive your Bitcoins instantly, withdraw your bank account cash before the order clears (in 2-3 days...possibly up to a week), and then Coinbase would be shit out of luck. You basically wrote them a hot check.
By requiring a major credit card, Coinbase makes sure they get their money. If you don't have enough funds or enough credit, the risk for that loss and the hassle of hassling you goes to the credit card company instead of Coinbase.

Sounds like useful upgrades.
I sure hope there are plenty of third party testers going into these reviews. I'm afraid most people on the network will blindly accept any upgrades to the protocol, making it easy for potentially disastrous changes to pass through. You can't benefit from a distributed system if every node follows the instructions of a central authority without thinking.
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:11:14
Putting money in a bank is only more "secure" because if your money is lost the central issuing authority will print more dollars to replace it. This is like saying a gold bar in a vault is "secure" because if it gets stolen someone will magically create a new one to replace it. FDIC is not security, it is devaluation. No matter what, if you trust a third party to handle your money you open yourself up to loss.
Bitcoin is indeed more risky than a savings account at the bank. But "risky" and "not secure" are not necessarily the same thing. Converting all your wealth to gold bars and hiding them at home would be risky, but whether or not they would be secure depends on many factors unrelated to the fact that your wealth happens to be in the form of gold bars.
The most optimal way to secure bitcoins is by running a network node on your private computer instead of trusting a third party, and backing it up. Of course, you would then need to keep your data safe by having up-to-date virus and spyware protection, a firewall, multi-layer encryption on the data, and so on. To be really paranoid, only keep that computer connected to the internet when absolutely necessary. Running a node on a Linux system instead of a Windows box would likely reduce the risk as well.
For the absolute best security, convert the bitcoin to a paper or even brain wallet (assuming you can create an appropriately secure brain wallet phrase), then delete the software on your computer entirely and never access the wallet until and unless you plan to spend it.
That wouldn't be a very convenient way to store things if you plan to use the funds, but it would be fairly secure. Just as sealing your gold into a concrete block and dumping it into the Atlantic wouldn't be convenient, but would be fairly secure.
If you demand 100% security, not even a concrete block on the bottom of the ocean would give you that. Nor can any bank. The US government could take 30% of your dollars out of your bank accounts tomorrow and there would be shit you could do about it. You call that secure?
**Edit:** Eventually, if Bitcoin gets big enough, there will be businesses and services that guarantee your deposits and insures them against loss. You can bet they will charge you a storage fee or such though, just like vaults charge fees for people who store valuables with them. These future businesses should be much more savvy and better protected than these idiots running the exchanges or online wallets which were recently compromised. It's very much an immature market at the moment in regards to 3rd party wallet providers.

These stories make me shrug. This is a brand new world of a complex system. There are always going to be risks and lots of problems associated with being one of the early adapters.
The complaints are legitimate of course; I don't mean to minimize or discard them. But I'm kind of surprised people are getting so worked up about this. I think expectations are too high for the relatively immature stage this whole project is in at the moment.
Of course, I might be singing a different tune if I was faced with the same issue. I sent $110 to Bitinstant on April 14th, and had my BTC in about half an hour. (I admit the fact that I had it sent to a simple bitcoin address, rather than an exchange account, likely had something to do with my success.)

That depends. As long as you never buy or sell bitcoin using the exchange, I see no chance of fraud charges. By the Chinese government's own admission, as a non-Chinese citizen I cannot participate in their banking system.
It's also good to keep in mind that a currency exchange, despite having to report diligently and being watched closely by governments, is not a government entity. It is just a business. A Chinese business has no good reason to know a random American's passport number, especially if they never did business with him.

@_date: 2013-04-14 20:08:55
As I understand it, BitInstant does not give you bitcoins bought with the money you send them. Most exchange companies don't. What they do is send you bitcoins that they already have on hand, and then they must wait for your funds to clear (sometimes several days) before the money you sent them finally falls into their hands.
In the mad craze of the past few weeks, what has sometimes happened is that the smaller exchange companies sent out so many bitcoins that they drained their supply dry before all the actual funds cleared. What I expect happened is that they were out of bitcoins at the time you sent the money, and had to wait for some funds to come in before they could acquire more bitcoins so they could send them to you. Or, perhaps they were simply swamped with orders and it took them a while to catch up.
My point is that the entire bitcoin economy got hit with nearly 10 times the usual amount of traffic. No financial system, including all the professional usual banks around today, could effortlessly handle such a gush of activity. These problems are frustrating, yes, but are an expected consequence of sudden influx of customers rather than necessarily a sign of lack of competence on the exchange companies.

Because, the main vulnerability with the bitcoin network would be if someone were able to alter the blockchain right after they make a payment, to nullify or change the payment they recently made so that they get the money back. This would require that they not only change the block that contains their transaction, but also that they change the hash on every block from then up unto the current block. This would require that the attacker control the majority of the computing power of the network to "catch up with" and eventually overtake the legit blockchain and replace it with their altered one.
If someone sends me a payment, and decides to try and take it back via hacking the system, my money would be safest if the transaction was confirmed in each block. The attacker would have to control the majority of the computing power in the entire bitcoin network in order to beat the network and rewrite the blockchain.
But, if the transaction was only confirmed a single time (when it was transferred to me) then the attacker could take his sweet time. Just so long as he adjusted the 1 block (the one that contained the transaction) before I spent that bitcoin, he could "take it back".
I doubt the latter is the case. I've read and learned a lot since I posted the original question, and it seems that each block confirms all prior transactions, regardless of when those transactions took place.
@_date: 2013-04-19 21:39:09
Not sure what you mean. If BTC Guild and 50 BTC put through a simultaneous change, the rest of the network would likely accept it as valid.
Even if BTC Guild just reaches 40%, any change they put through has a 50/50 chance of being accepted, apparently.
If this is inaccurate, I'm happy to learn why. But that would require an explanation as to why.
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:31:48
It's not too slow. It is in fact lightyears ahead of standard payment processes.
In the standard debit/credit network we have today, all that your "payment" represents is usually a quick check on your account balance to confirm that you have that much available. The actual transaction may take several days or even up to a week for the funds to change over to the business' account.

Illegal? What laws or regulations does it violate? It appears to me that Bitcoin is no more illegal than buying something from a friend with cash and not informing the state for the purposes of collecting sales tax.
You seem to be imagining things when you say Satoshi explicitly intended to devalue government currencies and devalue/destroy government. Where did you get that idea? Source?
As an aside, if the government's money (and by extension, government itself) is authentic and legitimate, they wouldn't have anything to fear from Bitcoin. If making up a computer program can destabilize a government and its currency, then that government wasn't very stable/legitimate to begin with.
Just because something might operate in a way "against a government" or even "illegal" does not automatically make it wrong. Perhaps you feel the American Revolution was morally reprehensible because it was illegal?

The system is not truly anonymous, as in all transactions are tracked and open to public scrutiny. In addition, unless one is using tor or something, the IP addresses and so on can be easily discovered.
Nodes, being constantly on-line profit machines, are especially easy to discover and relatively fewer in number. It would be little problem for legal authorities to track the initiator of a reset-command, if there were enough financial loss to do so.

I would not be surprised if he did indeed do some direct dealing of the drugs, but convicting him on that is different than trying to peg every Silk Road drug transaction on him as if he personally sold it all, which is what the media reports thus far seem to be implying.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:21:05
1.) I agree this seems to be an issue. It's possible though that the main problem is that this is relatively early in the process, with too few stable nodes to maintain the massive traffic lately. It might just fix itself, but possibly not and even if it does I agree it's not the best situation.
2.) Meh. Even if some guild gets massive enough to corner 99.9% of the computing power, they'd only make about 3,600 bitcoins a day. In a sea of over 11 million bitcoins, that's peanuts. True, after a year they will have over a million bitcoins, which would be enough to nudge the markets a bit if they so choose...but still it's only a fraction. And no one guild is ever going to reach that kind of computing power. I doubt any one guild would reach 1%.
3.) Yes, the relatively few numbers of exchanges are the major problem right now. It also doesn't help that the recent media frenzy basically DDOS'ed all of them and broke a lot of bones. I've been thinking that the solution is to create hundreds - if not thousands - of exchanges. I like your idea.
4.) The near-field-communication technology might take care of this for us. Apple might make it go live on their iPhones this year, and within just a year or two people will be hovering their smartphones over the pay pad instead of swiping their cards whenever they pay for anything. Just add a simple Bitcoin wallet app, and bingo! Buy your milk and eggs with bitcoin! I would bet real money this will happen in just 2-3 years.

@_date: 2013-11-13 14:48:37


I don't think so. It only needs to do what most debit/credit card transactions do already: Check the blockchain to confirm that the address has the necessary number of bitcoins.
The chances that the address are suddenly going to lose those coins before the transaction gets verified is very small. Sure, someone could go around spending BTC like mad in 10 minutes before the transactions get posted. Some of the later vending machines may get ripped off this way.
But that risk already exists for most credit/debit transactions. When you swipe your card at the grocery store it doesn't automatically deduct from your account. It might put a hold of $1 or so as a note of a pending transaction, but the actual funds may not leave for days.
@_date: 2013-04-23 14:33:33
Okay, thanks.
On a related note...what if my orphaned transaction was a double spend? When it comes up in the queue it will just be rejected, I assume. Hence, one reason to wait for several block confirmations I guess.

I'm not worried. Due to the underlying nature of the network and the proof-of-work concept, even when the system has zero lag I wouldn't fault an exchange for requiring a 6-block confirmation (about 1 hour).
Really, even that is remarkable in the world of economics. I have debit card transactions I made a week ago at Stop &amp; Shop that still haven't cleared my account at BoA.

Sure. And the value of bitcoins are certainly growing as the cost to mine them is jumping. But the difficulty in mining is jumping exponentially (expected 10-fold jump in hashrate, or so I've heard).
Unless bitcoins jump up to over 1,000 USD in just the next week or two, then for the short term I don't see a winning situation. Far, far better to just buy the bitcoins directly instead of investing in mining hardware, methinks. Rather unfortunate.

Would you be willing to give a summary of how bitcoin works and why you feel it was a good investment? No matter how much I read it just seems too abstract to me.

@_date: 2013-04-20 04:42:34
How would we even know a double spend had occurred?
Sure, if you were to scan the whole blockchain you might be able to find evidence of double spending. But since the attacker could verify transactions, that won't get noticed unless someone is tracking every bitcoin independently...which to me sounds like it would basically require running a wholly parallel bitcoin network.
As I understand it, an attacker would not have to maintain &gt;50% hashrate forever in order to fool the system, but just long enough to create a fork longer than the honest fork, at which point the whole network will use the attacker's fork as the true one.
I'm no expert on it all, but this is just what it appears to be from what I've seen. 
@_date: 2013-07-05 06:03:32
Hm. Maybe that is to blame for the Bitcoin nosedive today...
@_date: 2013-04-22 19:36:03
If the opportunity comes by to spend them, I will.
But so far, I just haven't found anything I want to buy where payment in Bitcoins is an option. This will likely change in time of course.
In the mean time, whenever I attempt to buy or sell something on Craigslist or eBay, I mention my willingness to accept or pay with Bitcoins. I may eventually try to sell things on Bitmit instead of eBay, but at this point Bitmit only gets enough traffic to generate decent bids on certain types of items.
Even if my grocery store started accepting Bitcoins though, I likely wouldn't be spending them too much just yet. The main reason is because it's a hassle to get new bitcoins. While it's true that increasing vendors who accept bitcoins is necessary for the system's growth, we will need a quick and easy way to earn new bitcoins before they really take off. I suspect this will initially be through home-based businesses and private individuals who make the decision to only operate in bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-09-15 03:51:30
I bought a tiny little ASIC eruptor a week or so ago for $32. Given the difficulty at the time, I calculated it would make me about $4.40 a week. Of course I knew the difficulty would rise, and the bitcoin exchange rate would fluctuate, but it seemed fair enough of value to be worth fooling around with. I thought "yeah, I'm not making any money off it, and it will probably take a few months to break even; oh well it's fun".
But just a few days later, once I received the chip and started mining...instead of $4.40, it was going at a rate of about $1.40 per week.
And now, the difficulty jumps. I'll never even break even on this thing. Not so fun any more. :(

All of these problems come from you making an account with the exchange company. They are therefore required by law to collect certain info about you. While creating such an account may have perks (I wouldn't know), it's entirely unnecessary. You can just get a free wallet somewhere and use them to transfer funds directly from a usual money source into bitcoins they deliver to an address in your wallet.
I used BitInstant just a few hours ago. Walked into a local WalMart (could have also used a CVS pharmacy, a gas station, or one of many other businesses), and sent off a MoneyGram. I just had to provide a name, phone number and address (all of which I made up on the spot; no ID required), pay in cash, and almost instantly my bitcoins appeared. Fantastically easy, with only a $3.95 fee. The only drawback is this type of transaction is  limited to a few thousand dollars, I believe.
@_date: 2013-09-16 03:19:41

Ah yes, the about-face I was expecting. Funny how "I love everyone" suddenly turns into "die, scum" when rehearsed positions are challenged.
Why do anarchists assume that every factory is a third-world shithole where children work 20 hour days and have limbs torn off in heavy machinery? Just because there exist some examples of horrid human rights in the world doesn't automatically mean that the concept is unsound.
Even if you know of a factory where people are actually abused like you imagine in your wet dreams, I challenge anyone to go "liberate" a group of factory workers from their evil masters. While they may cheer and celebrate at the moment, they will feel very different the next morning when they realize they suddenly don't have a livelihood.
And I *really* don't get why anarchists think "no one builds anything". Really? *Someone* made the machines, right? Do you think the people who made the machines were somehow taken advantage of and fooled into making them? The owner bought the machine from them, for christsake! If they didn't think that was a good thing, why the hell did they sell it to him? Why didn't they just build the machine for themselves?
Ah, shit, forget it. I've had this exact same argument with four other people on Reddit over the past few months.

Thanks. Yeah, I don't know. Maybe it's something "obvious" that people think shouldn't be clogging up the top post positions. I dunno.
Anyway, after a few more hours of research, I think the answer to my question is "yes, the former". Every time a block is completed (about once very 10 min) every transaction in the system is verified by one step.
Well...usually. Apparently there is a chance that it won't be confirmed on every block, and this chance can be increased by paying a voluntary transaction fee every time you send bitcoins. This fee goes to the "miners", as a sort of compensation for keeping the network running. Eventually, the amount of bitcoins you can get from mining will be insignificant, and at that point the only thing likely to keep people helping to keep the network running will be these fees. Le sigh.

Yes, but the bitcoin was still usable in largely the same respect. I said it was resistant to deflation, not immune. (No currency is.) The economy would have to inflate or deflate by several orders of magnitude before things became unstable.

I suggest you only put 10-20% of your available investment funds into play at once. Every paycheck (or perhaps every week if you're too impatient), put in another 10-20%, and continue until all the dough is in. This allows you to study the markets and learn a lot more. If something changes, you can adjust accordingly.
Yeah, if you do this and the price goes up, you won't make as much as you would have if you put it all in at the beginning. But, if you do the piecemeal approach and the price goes *down*, you will not have lost as much as you would have if you put it all in at the beginning.

And, I'll just mention that I've been told by self-proclaimed anarchist socialists that if I was a factory owner they'd come steal my machines because "no one should have a monopoly over the means of production". They can't give an answer when I ask why they don't build or save for and purchase their own machines... :P

That's fine. Anyone who wants to do their "duty" and report their income and pay taxes on it is still able to do so. But if not, the IRS won't be any the wiser.
Whether that is "moral" or "ethical" or not is irrelevant to the stability of bitcoin. The fact that plenty of people will always find this feature attractive will ensure that many people use bitcoin.

Correct, exchanges aren't in charge of the network. I meant to say nodes.
But a reboot, if it were even possible (I'm not sure it is), would require the majority of nodes to coordinate an acceptance of it. The vast majority of nodes came into existence long before the crazy media flash of the past few weeks, and therefore have profited from being part of Bitcoin "from the beginning" (or at least, relatively early in its history). The only benefit I can see from a reboot is that it will start everyone over on equal footing, wiping out the gains of those who have been in the game longer. Why would they want that?
I don't understand why you think miners have more to gain from a reboot. They would lose everything they've been working years to build up. Even if they "cashed out" all of their bitcoins right before resetting the system, this would crash the dollar worth of a bitcoin into the ground.
But all of this is irrelevant, I guess. Bitcoin will never be reset, because (1) doing so would collapse all faith in the system, and that would hardly be profitable to miners; and (2) people have spent significant amounts of cash on Bitcoins, to where anyone making the system crash or resetting it would be subject to serious legal action.
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:48:02
Yup. Although the dollar amounts are in the hundreds, each fall is for a smaller percentage of the overall price. This makes it more of a correction than an actual fall in value. The trend is still up, if not stable.

Depends on how many confirmations you are willing to accept. If someone were to set up a vending machine that took BTC, it would be fine for it to see the instant transaction on its local network hubs and spit out the soda or crisps. Very rarely, there might be a small chance the transaction doesn't get verified, but such rare and small losses would be insignificant for such a business model.
Even in the worst case, where you want 6 confirmations and wait around for an hour or so, that is much better than the days or even a week that traditional bank transfers can take.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:37:35
I see. Neat.
So, is the key simply a username/password for the hash, and the information on which bitcoins belong to the hash only recorded by the individual bitcoins out in the network? Or, does the **key** itself contain any info on what bitcoins the hash owns?
**Edit:** Originally said hash here; meant to say key.

If all of the coins you receive are via different addresses, sure. But if they are sent to the same address from what I understand they are basically "mixed". Sure, by looking at the blockchain people can see that 4 of the 50 coins in my address XYZ came from a tainted source. But if I send coins out from that address I am not aware of the system "remembering" which coins in an address came from where or even allowing me to separate them. If I'm incorrect about this protocol I'd be happy to learn more.

Huh? Why would they do that? Exchanges make money by transferring funds, which they can't do if no one has funds. Miners make money by generating bitcoins that people want, and no one will want them if they vanish. Plus, all the node owners would lose their bitcoins as well.

Good note about the DDOS and other hacks. I would not be surprised if the feds realized their best bet at attacking Bitcoin would not be directly the network, but the big public access points and main supporters.

No? I'd be willing to convert most of my finances to bitcoin, assuming the bitcoin economy becomes deep and wide enough, simply to reduce my tax burden. One-third to one-half of one's income is certainly enough of a worry to most people to sustain bitcoins in and of itself.
However, I feel the potential daily transaction utility of bitcoins is the major benefit. Not accountable to government whim says a lot to me.
Yes, something else more convenient could conceivably come around. But the more I learn about bitcoin the more I doubt it. Plus, if anything like that did come around there would be opportunities to convert any value you have tied up in bitcoins to the new system. And, the new system would likely be just as "vulnerable" as the bitcoin network, so I don't see how bitcoins are less viable than our current system or any conceivable future system.


Oh, I'm sure the tax man wants your money, whether or not such tax is moral, ethical, or otherwise legitimate.
A group of people in my neighborhood can get together and vote on a resolution that says everyone in a 1-mile radius has to pay them $10 a month in "organizational fees". That doesn't mean it's legit.
But that aside, there is nothing stopping someone using bitcoins to duly report their incomes and pay taxes as commanded, if they so choose.

"Illegally employed"?
"legal corporation/business"?
This implies that earning money any way other than as a government-registered employee, or running a business without registering it to the government, is somehow immoral.
But yes, for most people income will be easy to tax. Sales tax won't, if you just make one or more "spend" wallets that you transfer money to for shopping purposes (the government wouldn't know if you were shifting money to an off-books spending account or simply making a purchase). Inheritance or gifts to others won't be able to be taxed either. If you have your capital gains sent to an address not in your "legal wallet", maybe not even that. (Although, I admit it would be easy for the government to require financial institutions only send your capital gains to a government-registered wallet.)
Sorry, I didn't mean to imply bitcoin is the be-all-end-all of tax evasion. It's just a step towards that direction. Income tax is the big issue, but for those of us who make their money doing odd jobs and running small non-registered businesses, not so much.

I see a lot of sob stories on there that, I think, unfairly blame BitInstant.
Every exchange company has been having problems. Their systems were not designed to handle the massive influx of customers that have occurred in the past few weeks. Many of them were responsibly designed to handle 2x or 3x the amount of usual daily traffic, to handle for those odd times when the market got really busy.
But no one could have anticipated the avalanche of roughly 10x the amount of usual business. No standard bank or other mature business could have stood up to such an onslaught, either.
Financial transactions take time as well. When you use a debit or credit card, you assume the funds are transferred almost instantaneously. They are not. Behind the scenes, it can take several days (sometimes even a week) for all of the debits and credits that occur between banking systems to be completely settled. Bitcoin doesn't have the luxury yet of being integrated into the world financial markets to the point where the pseudo-instant transactions we are used to can occur easily.
Long story short, the system broke down because the system was caught off guard and unprepared, not because it was poorly run. I think it is unfair and counterproductive to blame BitInstant, or any other exchange. It will take time to work through the back-log. And by time, I don't mean 5 or 7 hours or some other laughably short length. I mean days. Possibly a good week.
And for those of you who are worried about losing money because the system was so bogged down you couldn't buy or sell the exact instant you wanted to...well, that's not unheard of in the world of speculation and exchange. Take it as a lesson not to demand certain things from a system you don't know enough about.

There is no app better than a good brain.
Buying gold bullion instead of Bitcoins would have the same problem. If they don't go through the trouble of buying a safe or opening and utilizing a safe deposit box, their gold is vulnerable to sudden and likely irrevocable theft.
Learning to use an offline wallet (personally downloaded client, paper, brain, whatever) takes much less time and effort than it would to work for the money to buy and go through the process of buying, installing and/or accessing a safe/box - assuming average computer competence.
One could buy gold ETFs or other financial instruments, or have a bank hold your gold for you. But as many institutions are finding out, that doesn't mean your gold is really there or that your investments are safe. There may be some insurance to cover losses, but Bitcoin is a long way from that.
I suggest that the best "app" would be explicit, simple education: Bitcoin is technical. Learn about it before you get involved. If you screw up, your money is gone for good. (Just as it would be if you buried a bunch of cash in a non-water-proof container, or if you dropped your gold coin down a sewer grate.) If you trust an online wallet, you risk hacking, theft, or even crooked exchange practices.
I'm sure more user-friendly user interfaces will enter the market soon enough. I'm not sure I would trust any of them, but we will see.

Maybe I didn't explain properly. Say your password is "password". You go around your files or the internet and copy/paste a few letters at a time. Perhaps you find places you can take the "pass", "ass" or "word" part out of context, or maybe you find all letters individually. Plus, you find them out of order, and you also do some other things on your computer or the internet in between each few letters of this process, such as searching Google for something or writing a few random phrases in a word document.
Unless the snoopy logger is fully capturing all form data as the "submit" button is being clicked (not merely as the data is being entered into the field), this should bypass it.
If some loggers can see the form data in bulk as it is sent, not just when it's entered, then yeah that's a problem. I have yet to see it demonstrated how such a program would work though, and to date all I've heard is assertions.

They have a huge percentage of the hash rate. It doesn't matter if it is over 50%. The more a single entity controls, the more likely their attempts to change the blockchain will be successful.

I think there *is* a built-in incentive to not reach 51%.
If one group controls the majority of the system, and so in theory could change the system unopposed, faith in Bitcoin might collapse almost instantly.
That's hardly in the best interest of a group who have invested so heavily into dominating the new currency.
**Edit:** Unless, of course, destroying Bitcoin is the true goal of whoever is behind BTC Guild. I suppose it's possible for some banking/governmental entity to put enormous resources into mining, plus attracting tons of other miners into their pool, all in an attempt to intentionally break 51% hash and destroy confidence in the system. It would be quite the brilliant operation if true.

Yes, and I think this is one reason behind the recent rally. Many people are realizing it's too late to jump on the mining bandwagon, and that it's easier to buy them straight out, raising the price.
But miners being unprofitable is one thing. Taking huge loses is another. I fear many miners (if not most) may never make enough to even pay for the cost of their rigs. Miners who sell their rigs will have to do so at a huge loss. Looking at the current hashrate and difficulty, there is no way I would ever buy a mining box at their original prices. Even the used rigs on eBay are too expensive to be worth it. I fear that most will be forced to sell their mining gear for ridiculously low prices compared to what they paid for them.
I'm afraid that many such miners could not afford to lose so much value. A big sell-off of their bitcoins may follow.

If only. It seems that BTC China only allows fiat withdrawals in CNY, and then only to one of the "big four" China banks or the main China online payment site Tenpay. Opening a bank account requires going into a physical building with a passport (preferably in China itself, but possibly via an American office branch), and making an opening deposit of at least US $1,000. I think I'll put that off for now.
On the other hand, Tenpay should allow one to transfer funds into USD (or most other major currencies). But from their website the details are not very clear and I'm waiting on a response from them now on how to open a Tenpay account. Can one send from a Tenpay account direct to an American bank account? Does it have to be a business account? Could they send to Paypal? Dunno yet.
Regardless of whether I could take out the yuan and convert to dollars however, I have still opened a BTC China account. At the very least, it provides me with another wallet to hold some bitcoins in (avoiding all eggs in one basket) as well as a place to stuff some money that is less vulnerable to US government control.

As long as "colorless" remains an option, I'm okay with it.
Of course, as long as colorless remains an option, the regulators may not be okay with it.
And so, bitcoin will either go "full rainbow", or be unregulated. I'd prefer the latter.

After a lot of mulling it over, I agree with the part of your assessment concerning the stability of the system. I realize now there likely won't be a sudden drop in processing power. But I still worry there is a related problem.
We have a situation where many people have sunk thousands of dollars - sometimes tens of thousands - into mining rigs, only to find themselves in a dramatically different environment than when they made the original investment. If someone decided to buy a mining machine due to the big April rally, for example, by comparison today the difficulty is 7-8 times greater and the total hashrate is 12 times as high. While I'm sure many expected both factors to increase, I doubt many anticipated the exponential growth that occurred. I suspect their ROI is nowhere near what they anticipated, and they may never be able to get out of the red.
So yeah, many may sell their rigs. At a loss. The network may not noticeably suffer (as it will hopefully be a long time before a mining machine just sits in a closet) but I'm afraid in the following months many miners will basically realize losses totaling in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Having a ton of Bitcoin's biggest believers and supporters take a big financial hit like that seems to have a bit of relevance for Bitcoin's reputation, methinks. I personally don't think it has any relevance on the stability of the system, but the general public, media, and more widely accepted financial institutions may do so. Imagine if there was a mainstream news story about the big losses Bitcoin investors took on mining rigs. PayPal, Forbes, and the average guy on the street wouldn't necessarily know or care that this isn't a threat to Bitcoin itself. They would likely see it as "yet another sign of Bitcoin's volatility and questionable value".
I'm probably worrying too much about it. But lots of intelligent people still dismiss anything Bitcoin related as a scam or idiotic investment. So I worry that anything which even appears to suggest a problem could have dramatic negative effects on Bitcoin's reputation.

As I understand it, from a seriously simplified perspective, nothing is really "transferred".
Each address has a number of bitcoins attached to it. The vast majority of the possible addresses have zero balance, and don't even appear yet in the blockchain record.
When you "send" bitcoins, the system subtracts the amount from the number in your address(es) and adds them to the number attached to the destination address. It first checks your private key for your addresses to make sure you have authority to make this transaction.
A wallet is a software file that keeps your addresses and their associated private keys (needed to prove ownership of the address, to allow you to spend the bitcoins "in" that address) together into one "account" so to speak. You can either have a wallet running on your own machine, or have a company (such as Mt. Gox) hold the wallet on their servers.
If you wanted to transfer funds from a Mt. Gox account to a paper wallet, you would first need to form a wallet on a machine you control. Then, send the bitcoins from the Mt. Gox wallet to an address in your local wallet. Once done, you can then have the local wallet program "export" itself into a relatively short code representing the whole wallet, which you can put on a flash drive or even print out on a simple piece of paper and hide as a physical object. Anyone who has that paper could use it to prove ownership of a wallet, and thus authority over spending the bitcoins in the wallet's addresses.
However, this paper wallet is just a "snapshot" of the wallet. If you were to continue to use the wallet, the paper wallet would be immediately out of date. (I'm not sure what would happen if someone were to try to use it after the on-line wallet were changed, however...)
Whew! Hopefully that mess is somewhat comprehensible. If I'm off on any of this, I'm sure someone will point it out...

On a related note...why are we giving Mt. Gox a monopoly on the exchange?
I think it should be pretty easy for someone to program a site that gives a wider picture, by providing a weighted average of the rate from across dozens of exchanges.
Yeah, Mt. Gox's rate is likely to heavily influence this, but I'm afraid if some action isn't taken...well, a decentralized currency isn't decentralized if only one company controls that currency's interaction with the rest of the world economy.

Even better, do you have evidence of the existence of the bitcoin at the time of auction? For example, did you give a pic with the QR code in the auction listing so bidders could confirm the bitcoin's existence?

Why not? Deflation with Bitcoin is limited by its limited nature. Also, if everyone is hoarding bitcoins and the bitcoin economy then suffers, there will ergo be little value in having a bitcoin (because it won't be in demand as a currency if no one uses it).

Yes, actually. At least, eventually, once they realize they lose more money by having the rigs run than they would if they just threw them away. Oh, I'm sure people who buy the rigs try to run them. But if the problem persists, they will just give up and try to sell them off again. At each iteration, more and more value is lost due to resales. But even though the final people in the line who actually keep their machines running may pull a profit, the overall expense everyone put into the mining hardware may never be recovered.
I'm aware of the history. What you are describing is what I suspect will happen again ("The hash rate dropped until the price rose enough for them to turn back on.") But in the mean time I suspect the rally will significantly cool down for a bit.
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:01:23
Yes, that's exactly what I was using it for. With the vulnerability of online wallets, as well as the potential for confiscation, and to account for some failure of my personal wallets, I have my online bitcoins split up between a handful of wallets. To truly diversify, I decided to hold some "out of the country" as it were.
Of course I realized there was the potential for such a problem as this occurring, but that's why I split them up to begin with. It is also why the majority of my bitcoins are in cold paper storage. I only keep a bit online for purchases and playing the markets a bit.

While it is true that a single pool doesn't need 51% on its own to attack the system, this BTC Guild issue still matters. It is far easier to piece together collusion if you have less colluding to do.
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:22:53
Sure. But the new owners would soon realize how much of a profit loss they're taking, and many might sell the machine off again in short order. At each sale of the mining rig, the sale price has to go lower and lower to convince someone else to try their luck. At some point, some people may very well leave it idle.
I have a tiny ASIC miner (336 Megahash) which I bought a month or so ago for $32. When I bought it, I calculated it would make me around $4 a week. Cute and fun! Not gonna make me rich, but after 10 months or so it would pay itself off. Unfortunately, by the time it arrived just three days later, the difficulty and hashrate had jumped to where it was only making $1.16 a week. The next week, it made less than 50 cents. Today, it's around 6 cents a week; I would have to run my computer and the mining chip 24/7 for a full month to make a quarter. At that rate, it will take 10 years and 9 months to pay itself off. And of course, the difficulty will change many times and quite dramatically; that 25 cents per month is not going to last long. If a month can reduce my profit rate from $4/week to 6 cents a week, what is next month going to do?
My mining chip will never pay itself off. No one will buy it for anything but pennies. It just sits idle; the above measurements didn't even factor in the electric cost and wear and tear costs of keeping my computer running 24/7. I realize the numbers are less dire for the larger, legit mining rigs. But with such exponential drop-off in profits I find it hard to believe there are no problems.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:32:14
Hm. It seems the bitcoin data will only continue to expand then. It's currently around 6.5 gigabytes I believe, and I assume that every time a transaction is made (and of course, whenever new bitcoins are created) the size of the data the nodes need to sync will increase. Even once we hit the limit of 21 million BTC, the data would increase.
Although, I wouldn't be surprised if at some point a way is created to "strip down" a bunch of the data in bitcoins that have extensive trading histories. At some point, I don't see the value or necessity of having bitcoins record their transaction histories ad infinitum.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:52:04

The problem here is that people and businesses are used to conducting business through an intermediary (such as Visa or Mastercard) instead of the underlying banking system itself.
In most cases, all your cardswipe "purchase" does is check your account and confirms that you have at least that number of dollars available. It then allows the purchase, assuming that in the vast majority of cases there will be little chance of double-spending. But it actually takes several days or sometimes even up to a week before the funds are actually taken out of your account and deposited in the business' account. Hence, the possibility of overcharge fees and the like.
What Bitcoin needs is a similar payment interface to overlay the fundamental bitcoin network. Some app that confirms via a blockchain inquiry that enough funds exist, and then goes through sending the transaction. Presto, no problem.
The bitcoin network is actually wicked fast. Even in the rare worst scenario, where it takes an hour or two for enough confirmations, that's much better than the days or even a week standard banking transactions can take.

No one owns bitcoins, they just possess the wallet keys? I suppose that's correct from one perspective. But then by that logic no one owns the dollars in their bank accounts, they just possess the debit card, password, magnetically-inked checks, etc. that allows them to shuffle the digital currency around.
In 2140, I seriously doubt there will be a problem with computing power maintaining the network. The simple architecture of the bitcoin network, even if it were dealing with millions of transactions a day, at that point might be run by billions of nodes simply running in the background of everyone's smartphone or home computer (or whatever we have at that point).
In ~127 years of computer power advancement, I find it hard to believe people will need much incentive to participate in the network. If anyone wanted to "reset" bitcoin, they would have to either directly control or coordinate the majority of the network processing power to do so. Good luck with that, even today.
And, even if they could do so, they wouldn't be earning anything. Everyone's bitcoins would be wiped out, the system would be proven unsustainable, and there would be a mass movement to another alternative.
Your argument is basically "they would do it to make money", but the very process you are saying they would use (which from what I see would be technically impossible to pull off) would devalue bitcoin to the point of worthlessness. They would not make any profit, and in fact would be wiping out their own amassed fortunes. There is no reason anyone would do this. Even if they could, which they can't.
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:07:27
I'm glad to see someone thinking, working things out, and considering alternatives, but I don't think this particular idea would fly.
First off, I don't understand your point about being used more easily by developing countries. Because there wouldn't be a fee? A fee is generally optional as it is now. Not sure if I understand your point clearly.
Second, basing the value of a coin on some arbitrary value, instead of what people are actually willing to pay for the coin, sounds like blatant price manipulation. It doesn't matter if pegging the value to a basket of commodities is a widely accepted practice; who decides what commodities, and who decides what percentage of each is weighted to the price, and who decides when the commodity list is changed?
Why would anyone accept the coins as payment for goods and services? It would be cheaper for them to buy the coins directly from the issuing authority.
Anyone accepting the coins would be immediately losing money, even before you figure in the effects of inflation from the new money entering the system from the central authority.

And so I receive yet another "rebuttal" that doesn't address any point I raised, other than to say that my opinions are mean and hurt people's feelings.
Apparently, they *are* glad they have a job...else why are they working there? I'm not saying their difficulties are something to ignore, but they certainly must be better than the alternative because...again, why are they working there?
I wasn't calling factory workers parasites, I was calling those who would take over the factories parasites. They already get the profits of working in the factory; this is known as "wages". If this in insufficient, they are welcome not to work in the factory. They are welcome to start their own factory, where there is no owner or boss. Yet...surprise!...they don't.
I'd be all for putting an end to horrible, inhumane working conditions, but having the workers take over everything isn't going to work.
The workers in a factory don't own the factory. Sure, the construction guys brought it into existence. The employees within do the operations, and produce the goods that keep the factory running. If it were not for them, the owner wouldn't have a factory to claim ownership of. In a philosophical sense, yeah they are the factory.
But the reverse is also true. If it were not for the owner, their would be no factory either. *Somebody* has to plan everything, make the connections, save or otherwise collect the capital to build, make connections and deals to distribute the goods to market, and make decisions on how things should operate so the whole operation doesn't fall apart...which is all to the benefit of every factory worker.
Once again, if the workers own the factory, why is there even a problem with bosses and owners? Why didn't a group of people just build a factory and start running it on their own from the very beginning?


Ah yes. As expected. Damn facts, damn reason. It's all just cuddly feelings that you people operate on.

The way around this is to sell/buy a physical representation, even if it is just a print-out of the address and associated private key.
If you receive the physical bitcoin, and upon inspection discover that the address in question is empty or that the private key does not work, then I think you would have a case.
As I see it, the deal would have been for a physical object, the value of which was based on information the seller claimed it contained. If you were to buy what the seller claimed was a vegetarian cookbook, only to discover it contained only recepies that required pork, you could clearly claim "product not as described".
**Edit:** If you buy a physical representation of a bitcoin, and it is genuine, I suggest you immediately move the funds to another address. The seller could easily have retained the information for himself, hoping you let the bitcoins sit in the address for a while and suddenly moving them to another address himself after a few days.

Technically, since a bitcoin is infinitely dividable, the supposedly "hard limit" of 21 million is meaningless. The location of the decimal place is meaningless. There can just as easily be 21 million *million million* "units" of bitcoin in circulation.
But that's fine. Because although the position of the decimal place is arbitrary, it is at least defined. This allows for a comparison of quantity, and the whole system will still work as it's still operating under the principle of supply and demand.
If we get to the point where 1 BTC is worth thousands of dollars though, we'll likely have to come up with some sort of other notation to represent tiny fractions of bitcoin in order to make everyday purchase prices reasonable.
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:26:19
Ah, I see. Each transaction references the prior transactions to prove where it got the bitcoins it is now attempting to spend. To prove a coin is untainted, one could simply follow all transactions back and make sure that each input can be ultimately traced back to a truly virgin address, one where the only inputs were due to mining rewards.
Thank you! This helps immensely.

I can't imagine the stress you must be feeling. I'm sorry things are so chaotic. Take some time to clear your head and stay calm.
You need to learn more about investing and finances. At this point, you appear to letting your emotions run everything. Your statement that "I know I can earn this money back, I just need to figure out how" is a big red flag that you don't have a healthy perspective on this problem. 
Many *experts* in this field lose money. And you, my friend, are no expert.
If you truly believe in the future of Bitcoin because you deeply understand it and have a thorough grasp of how it interacts with the financial systems of the world, then perhaps you could buy in at the current low and hold for the long term (that is up to your analysis and decision; I am not advising any particular action). But I suspect that any belief you have in Bitcoin is mostly emotional, or you are choosing to believe due to a desperate need to find a solution.
Honestly, this is just a lousy situation. I wish I could offer something to help you out, but cutting your loses is likely the best solution. Your post makes it clear that you haven't really learned your lesson, and instead are still fixated on gaming the system. "How can I guarantee that I earn high returns?" I'm sorry, but you just don't seem to get it. There are NO guarantees. The only way to not lose money is to not spend it.
Maybe you should have a lawyer set up a trust for your sister, and put all the remaining money into that. The lawyer could disburse the funds to your sister as necessary for college, which is the least you owe her. As far as your part of the inheritance goes, I think you just had a very expensive life experience.
Stay calm, friend. Again, I'm sorry you're going through this. But all you can do now is move forward.

Tor is incredibly powerful...once your connection enters the Tor network. But your traffic often goes through several "normal internet" servers before hitting one that gets you into the Tor network. Then, on the other side, your connection may have a few more hops on normal servers once it leaves the Tor network before it gets to the server storing the info you are after.
The latter wasn't the case for Silk Road, since it was stored on Tor servers. But because of this overall network configuration, it is pretty easy to identify the Tor servers. The connections between Tor servers may be well protected, but the vast majority of those servers also still have lots of connections in and out to the normal internet.
I don't know if just taking over *any* Tor server would have helped the feds analyze intra-Tor traffic, but I suspect not. It does appear that they went after a specific server they believed hosted Silk Road. All I can assume is that they had enough records of regular internet connections going into and out of that server to convince a judge to sign a warrant.
I'm sure more details will be forthcoming.

Really? What identity are you attaching to the address? Their mugshot from your security cameras? If they're buying stuff on the internet, you might have a name and address, but still then:
People use many addresses. Some have only tiny fractions of bitcoins on them. Many addresses are only used once.
Certainly, you might be able to eventually make some guesses about what wallets used what addresses to pay for what, and might be associated with a physical address and/or name (or pseudonym). But it would be a big mess with many, many holes and dead ends. People may even trade/sell/buy wallets.

That is only a temporary issue when anything new of value is presented into the market. Once it becomes more ubiquitous the "get rich quick" aspect will die off.
When Facebook (or any company really) goes public, the first mass movement is a game of "when should I buy/sell", as investors try to take advantage of the ups and downs in price that always occur before the market determines the true value.
Today, those who buy and sell Facebook stock are much more interested in what they can use this "currency" for (such as dividends, etc.) and less focused on the "exchange rate" (price of the stock).

The way I undertand it, you can abandon an address at any time. Just shift the funds to another address you own, or distribute it amongst several addresses. Some people never use an address more than once.
Yeah, most people won't take these steps, and will just use one address for everything they do, for years. I agree that could eventually be tracked. But it would be harder than tracking through the current system, I believe.

I think the price was a bit overblown due to speculators and media hype. I expect the price to actually decrease soon, as speculators get tired of the stability and bail.
But it will go up again eventually. Even though lots of new businesses are accepting Bitcoin, the fraction who are is still infinitesimally small compared to those who don't. At some point though, an inflection point will be passed whereby there are enough businesses that take it that almost everyone will want some Bitcoins. May take a few years though.

The Bitcoin economy isn't robust enough to settle into a true worth value, in my opinion.

I get frustrated when I hear people complaining. Coinbase is simply a company that sells and buys bitcoin. They are not an exchange. They are not a bank. The whole game is still in the infant stage as well, so I'm sure there will continue to be the occasional glitch for a while yet.
In the worst case scenario, the recent explosion of bitcoin value and the drying up of liquid coins may have resulted in Coinbase deciding to not continue with prior transactions. While this would not be a wise move from a PR standpoint, as long as you got your original money back I'm not sure how upset one could legitimately get.

Sure. And anyone who wishes to report their income and pay the legally required tax is not prevented from doing so.
But the tax man has no way of knowing I have bitcoins, nor how many. While the option to keep this private might be "illegal", whether it is immoral, unethical or unwise is a subjective point. Regardless though, this aspect is a legit point of inherent attractiveness of bitcoin, which creates value (because people want it).
**Edit:** As an aside, the last I heard, in the US you only have to report additional income of $800 per year or more. Plus, since bitcoins are not considered a currency and their utility as a commodity is very dubious, I wouldn't be surprised if you only legally had to report "capital gains" if you converted your bitcoin profits to dollars, *and* this resulted in a net gain of at least $800. But this was a few years ago, and of course I'm not a legal adviser. :)

Unfortunately, due to a matter of scale, it is a problem today. There are so few bitcoins and the network is so small (relatively speaking) that even a small exchange or online wallet provider being compromised does negatively impact the whole bitconomy.
This problem will take care of itself in time however, as the number of people using bitcoins increase and the size of the average transaction decreases.
But there will always be stories of the equivalent to the idiot who carried around thousands of dollars in cash and was mugged. :P

I don't pay for cable at all. Not worth it to me. I'm not forced to use it, so I'm not forced to pay for it.
If Comcast built streets, it would only do so if it could turn a profit. When E-470 in Denver was built, I didn't give a damn that it cost $4.50 to access. It cut my travel time to the airport down from 2:45 to 1:30. The project was something the city or state wouldn't do because it couldn't fund it with taxes.
If Comcast were to buy the streets from the government, on the other hand, well that might be different. But then alternatives would open up. At the very least, the government wouldn't be able to justify many of the vehicle registration and gasoline taxes, which we could instead use towards paying for using Comcast's roads. Or, if roads in general became too pricy to travel as consistently as we do today, then cities would shift into a different configuration based on that supply/demand dynamic (for example, possibly taller buildings, cities not as spread out). I bet you if all roads were essentially toll roads that mass transit businesses would suddenly see a boom.

I have been somewhat worried that once all BTCs are mined, the transaction fees will not be as shiny a prize to go after, and many miners may decide it is not worth continuing to contribute to the network after that point.
But upon reflection, I guess that isn't as much of an issue as I was afraid of. If Bitcoin has increased in popularity by then, then sure the "profits" of mining might not be as lucrative, but the miners will still get some money and I have no real data or concrete proof that it won't be worth it to them.
If the bitconomy drags to the point that miners start leaving the network because they aren't making enough to be worth the energy input, then the network can "vote" to increase the fee rate. So my "it doesn't matter" would have been better stated as "I guess there isn't as much to worry about as I first thought".
Still could be wrong though. The mining of the last block could still see some shock to the system. :)
@_date: 2013-09-29 04:25:25
I personally do not see Bitcoin ever becoming a currency of daily use. I could be wrong, but to me it seems like it will be limited secure storage and inflation protection of wealth, while transactions will be limited in number and most often reserved for larger movements of value.
The main issue is that Bitcoins aren't secure enough from theft. If their Bitcoins can be stolen, people are going to stop listening at that point and not even care about any potential benefits.  The fact is, the vast majority of people will not create secure wallet passphrases. The vast majority won't secure their wallets at all. Do all the promoting and awareness campaigning you want, human nature will win out. Even if software UI layers come into play that reduce the technical aspects of Bitcoin for the end users, then thieves will simply write programs to fish passphrases out of popular Bitcoin phone apps, for instance.

**Price:** The trade value on the exchanges will continue to stabilize and grow moderately over time. There will be a few corrections, some of which will be hundreds of dollars, but these drops as a percentage of the overall value of a bitcoin will generally be smaller than prior drops. By the end of the year, 1 BTC will be very solidly at pairity with a 1 Troy ounce of gold, and perhaps a bit above.
**Commercial Utility:** In addition to Overstock, several other moderately large companies will begin to accept Bitcoin. Specifically, I predict Subway will publicly endorse it by the end of the year, and recommend all of their franchises to accept Bitcoin payments. The number of other brick-n-mortar locations accepting BTC will explode, possibly to 10 times or more the number accepting it today.
**Financial World:** At least one, most likely 3 or more, standard big banks will begin offering financial instruments connected to Bitcoin in some way. A few broad government mandates/regulations may come into existence in an attempt to restrict money laundering, but these will negligibly impact the big banks and have zero impact on those who increasingly keep their transactions within the Bitcoin network.
**Social:** By the end of the year, Bitcoin will be broadly accepted by the general public as a viable system, although most people will not be using it and will view it as, at best, a complex game. News stories will be far less critical of Bitcoin, and reports of its difficulties or peculiarities will be discussed with more of a "this is an issue that needs to be addressed" attitude than a vilifying one.
**Technology:** Systems allowing integration of vending machines to the bitcoin network will become easily available, although not widespread. People will begin to more fully explore uses of the protocol other than merely exchanging value (proof of ownership/title, verifications of all sorts of things, etc.). This area is really hard to predict.
**Summary:** Solidification. Compared to most technologies and new ideas, Bitcoin will continue to have phenomenal, extremely rapid growth and acceptance. However, I predict a 100x jump in market value will *not* happen. The year 2015, however, is another story. :)

It sounds like all double spends will eventually be discovered, and the risk is only if the vendor/recipient doesn't wait for enough confirmations before giving over the good/service. Even if an attacker did a 51% attack and forced a dishonest fork (containing a 2nd transaction of previosly spent bitcoins) to overtake the main chain and thus become the main chain (thus effectively reversing the first transaction, I think), the double spend would still be apparent.
@_date: 2013-10-03 22:40:09

Well, Bitcoin is infinitely divisible. If necessary, the protocol can be changed to extend the decimal places to any extent. So there will bever be a problem with "not enough Bitcoin to go around".
I can't think of how such a buy-in would hurt the bitconomy. It might give the government an unfair advantage financially, but only initially. If Bitcoin gets that big, I don't think governments would be able to buy Bitcoin with fiat so easily without massively debasing their own currency.

Yup, that's American news alright.
@_date: 2013-04-22 20:25:05
The supply is infinitely expandable, because it is infinitely divisible.
We are already to the point where 1 BTC is too valuable to be the basic unit of exchange; most purchases are on the order of hundredths of a bitcoin.
In the far-flung future, if everyone is getting their paychecks in bitcoins, perhaps the "supply" would be so "tight" that 0.00001 BTC would be considered an average middle-class annual wage.
This is deflation. But it's not a dirty word. It is the natural consequence of every limited commodity. Deflation is only harmful if it happens very rapidly (which is why speculator-driven booms are unpleasant to me).

If BTC Guild has any brains, they will back off.
If they break 50% of the network hashrate, confidence in Bitcoin could very well collapse.
That would hardly be smart for a group which must have invested an insane amount of capital and energy into the currency. Whoever heads BTC Guild needs to put up a hard block on new members, and possibly start kicking out members.
It is in *everyone's* best interest for them to do so, including BTC Guild's.
**Edit:** Unless, of course, destroying Bitcoin is the true goal of whoever is behind BTC Guild. I suppose it's possible for some banking/governmental entity to put enormous resources into mining, plus attracting tons of other miners into their pool, all in an attempt to intentionally break 51% hash and destroy confidence in the system. It would be quite the brilliant operation if true.

@_date: 2013-04-22 18:58:25
In regards to your second question, I'd like to point out that debit and credit cards are not instant.
All they do is get a quick confirmation from your bank that the account exists, and that the available balance is at least as much as the amount being charged. If that's all okay, they proceed with ejecting your chips and soda.
The actual processing and transfer of funds can take several days...sometimes a week. In this regard, the Bitcoin network is lightyears ahead of traditional systems.
But back to the vending machine. In addition to the 0-confirmation data from the point of sale that others have mentioned, I suspect the machine could also do something similar to the debit/credit process: check the blockchain (which is pubic and open for all to read) for the address of the bitcoins you're attempting to spend, and confirm that the number of coins in that account is at least as high as the number you're attempting to spend.
@_date: 2013-07-16 12:20:12

That isn't as terrible as the translation makes it sound. China's is pretty big on carefully controlling the economy, the culture, family dynamics, and pretty much everything else. Most people in the country feel strongly that strict control of all aspects of one's life is the best way to run things. I understand your concern, but at the moment it seems to me that they are basically saying "bitcoin could disrupt the economy enough to harm people, so we won't allow that".
It's a fine-line distinction though. I am a bit concerned as well. But if bitcoin gets big enough to where people can spend it in a variety of places without converting to fiat, I doubt any government will be able to reliably wage war on it.
@_date: 2013-04-16 01:35:18
The crux of it though, I think, is the NFC technology. I'm hopeful the NFC takes off because it (plus smartphone apps) seems to me to be the easiest, fastest way to integrate Bitcoin into the established economy.
I also have faith Bitcoin will eventually make it strong even if NFC fails to take hold, but would likely take much longer on its own.

As BTC are lost, the value of the remaining pool would adjust accordingly. Prices of goods and services valued in bitcoin would be labeled as less and less (using more decimal places, even more of which could be created in the future if need be).
If we get to the point where a gallon of milk averages 0.000023 BTC, then yeah that would be ridiculous. But at that point the economy would be stable enough to where the standard could be recalculated. I imagine a movement to adjust the decimal to a reasonable position would take place.
And, if at some point in the far future someone holding massive quantities of bitcoins were to suddenly become active and spend them? Well, I imagine it would be like if some government today were to sell off all of their gold bullion stores; the price of gold would collapse.
BUT, they'd have to sell off the gold/BTC pretty quickly to take any advantage of their advantage. The price would collapse so fast their massive holdings wouldn't be worth that much. And, although the price would "collapse", it would eventually reach a new balance point. But this is the same thing that would happen if the dollar amount of cash in the world were to suddenly increase (thank you, Fed. Reserve...).
More than likely though, anyone holding on to those big bitcoin addresses who eventually spends them would do so at a slower rate than "all at once". Then, the economy will gradually accept them with little disruption.
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:22:01
Okay, so these coins are likely original minted coins. And they have not been spent yet. But what makes you think they are "gone"?
I have some money in my bank savings account that's been there since 2009, but just because it isn't circulating in the economy doesn't mean it's gone.
Given the recent rapid rise in value, I'm not in the least surprised that early adopters are holding most of their assets.
@_date: 2013-06-10 01:18:28
I agree with all you said.
When I hold bitcoins, I realize that I am taking a risk. Despite all of its benefits and securities that I've seen in my ~12 hours of research and programming background, I still realize there are risks and problems.
However, I am willing to gamble the (relatively small) amount of money I have in bitcoins in order to increase the odds that the system survives the test of public faith.
When the exchange rate drops and people are telling each other to "hold", I take it not as a pep-talk to "keep faith in bitcoin", but as a reminder that if people get skittish and sell at every minor drop in exchange rate that this will destable the whole bitconomy.
@_date: 2013-04-20 02:52:09
The fact that the IP address of the vast majority of bitcoin users is *not* anonymous makes it possible for the government to be actively involved in the bitcoin economy. Today, you basically have to have a government-registered bank account in order to be paid from a usual wage/salary job, so the government can tax it. There is little stopping the government from requiring all salary/wage payments be deposited in fully registered and tracked bitcoin addresses/wallets.
While you raise many good points worth considering, I doubt the transition will be so sudden, nor will governments be completely helpless. At some point, they will become invested in bitcoin too.
And they might be already "attacking" the bitcoin system... The fact the the vast majority of the hashrate of the bitcoin network is controlled by only a handful of mining pools is making me very nervous. Many people could pull out of bitcoin merely from that threat.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:29:44
If a coin raises in price, then everyone will start spending smaller fractions of coins, and will do so in an equal and even amount.
For example, if today 1 BTC = 100 USD, I might buy a gallon of milk for 0.05 BTC.
If next week 1 BTC = 120 USD, then to get the same gallon of milk I would only be willing to spend 0.0417 BTC.
That wasn't a great or elegant example, but the point still stands that Bitcoin is inherently resistant to the effects of deflation or inflation because it can be revalued instantly. This will be even less of a problem in the future once it becomes less volatile. The events of the past few weeks were driven by massive and sudden media frenzy, and don't say much about Bitcoin itself.

Well, that may work, but since the difficulty would adjustment back twice as fast the "easy difficulty" run would end pretty quick. There's nothing stopping them from doing it now either, yet it seems that they don't. Mining is so unprofitable now, I can't imagine anyone turning back their hashing.
And, they are basically gaming the system pretty well as it is. The total network hashrate grows so rapidly that big miners get a whole 2,016 blocks to take advantage of their processing advantage. As the weeks go on we get blocks finished in only 7 minutes, 5 minutes, 3 minutes... Sure, it goes back up to around 10 minutes once the 2,016 are done, but then they have a whole new 2,016 blocks to "work ahead".
If the difficulty changed every week, then increases in hashing power that happened in the interim wouldn't give them as much of an advantage.

Vending machines that accept credit/debit cards have a small radio/cell antenna to verify transactions. You could look into writing a small program for such devices which continually queries a certain bitcoin address for that machine, sends an "okay to dispense" message to the machine when it sees funds deposited to that account, and also refunds any excess balance after 15 seconds or so (to avoid problems with people accidentally sending too much).

Thankfully, Coinbase just secured $25 million investment capital. Not only will this allow them to hire more, and better, security experts to solidify their system (which, in my opinion, is already pretty solid), but the investors behind that money will demand pretty strict organization and "cover your ass" features, and so on. Coinbase now has a lot more incentive to not fuck up.

Yeah, I think many places are okay with 0 confirmations because (1) they only do small-amount purchases that would be ludicrous to intentionally carry out a double-spend hack for, (2) with a large enough customer base, the random dropped transaction for an orphaned branch of the chain wouldn't be such a big deal, but mostly (3) if you want to see a new system grow into something more, you have to take a little risk and be willing to take a little loss. :)
Personally, the more I learn about the Bitcoin system and its programming, the more I'm starting to doubt it will ever become a practical point-of-purchase device. Maybe I'm wrong, but I think it will primarily be a tool for secure, fast, semi-anonymous movement of cash around the planet. That itself has much more important implications for humanity than being able to buy a Starbucks cup without government oversight.

You are not "dependent" upon society for that assistance if you did something else instead that is useful to the society, and then traded that value for the axe, etc.
If society ceased to exist and you wanted to build a house, you could do it yourself. (After all, someone originally made an axe. Someone originally designed a plumbing system. Etc.) It would not be as convenient, having to learn so many things instead of having the assistance of a division of labor system, but being *inconvenienced by the lack* of something does not mean you are *dependent* on that thing. The state of being inconvenienced itself is a fallacy, as for the vast majority of human history we didn't even have the modern aspects of housebuilding to compare to. It was not an inconvenience to not have central air a hundred years ago, any more than it is an inconvenience today that we don't yet have food printers in our kitchens.
You make it sound like society is some magical security blanket that just showers us all with benefits, and that humanity would perish from the inability to get anything done should society not always be there and be supportive.

If the total processing power working on the network were to increase suddenly, confirmations would become significantly quicker across the network. Yes.
But this effect would be brief. Once the usual 2016 blocks had been found, the network would immediately adjust the difficulty to take this jump in processing power into account...and we'd be right back to 10 minute confirmations.

Something else for people to kee in mind:
When the "value" of a BTC fluctuates, that could just as easily be a reflection in the United States Dollar value rather than anything inherently good/bad about Bitcoin.

They look unread...
Seems legit.

I don't think so. I think you're safe. They just hit their daily limit of transactions for today.

The economic effects of hording a limited currency balance out the problem automatically.
If a bunch of people horded the bitcoins, sure the value might go up due to scarcity. But at some point there are so few units in circulation that it's too much of a hassle to try and use them, and people quit using bitcoin and start using some other currency instead. Then, the value of a bitcoin drops because no one can use it.
If someone were to hoard half of all bitcoins, the relative value of the remaining coins in circulation might increase, but then a new norm is created.
Like right now, there are about 11 million bitcoins in existence. What we have now is what it would be like if 22 million existed, but someone was hording half of them. Meh. The system still functions.

Meh, *my* codebases are inconsistent in coding styles.
