Paypal 2.0 is exactly what Bitcoin could become with Blockstream, and possibly why their CTO and Founder Greg Maxwell push so hard for 1 MB. It is unfortunate that he is also a core dev, with this potential immense conflict of interest in mind.
It is likely that Blockstream intends to make a scalable payment network on top of Bitcoin. The considerable investments into Blockstream is because of the huge revenue potential of such a payment network. The revenue stream will come from Bitcoin users, and when Blockstream sits on the important technology, the important devs, and infrastructure, it will be hard for competitors to catch up, effectively making Blockstream the Paypal of Bitcoin.

Me too. Imagine that, Bitcoin with a fee valve.

I like it. Attention grabbing. So tired of paying insane fee for Bitcoin transactions.

Stop crying and start competing.

Maybe so, but clicking a few pixels, and base a post on that with a very negative message is not uniting people. I clicked on around 20 destructive pixels for a small sample size; 15 random people, 5 who posted in this sub. So, should I go to btc sub and post about that? I think not. I'd rather attest it to being missclicks or just playing around. Point being, think positive and maybe give people the benefit of the doubt once in a while.

I don't see any proof or indication of that claim what so ever - no pattern of that on r/place. No, the real enemies are people like you - pretty new account posting "Divide &amp; Conquer" content. The scary thing is that it gets uncritically upvoted.

Pure off-chain scaling could definitely hurt privacy much more. Third party hubs would work somewhat like banks, and in most countries by law, probably require you to submit your personal information.

Yeah, it's not like we need a Monero dev to teach people a lesson. There's enough shitcoins out there with pump'n'dump devs who does this every day.

Curious why is a lenghty article about the first Bitcoin ETF on one of the most visited invesment sites downvoted?
Edit: that obviously changed.

Good luck bro! Maybe it will save them that crypto is booming. Exchanges earns well and even if they haven't got the money, they might be able to sell of a share of their exchange to another, to cover. Appears this post got caught by auto-moderator.... already buried.
