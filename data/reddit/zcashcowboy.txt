@_date: 2017-04-21 14:23:10
No it doesn't. There is nothing about a hot dog stand volume, centralized ownership altcoin that isn't even based on the same POW or codebase that creates a test bed for anytbing. 
SegWit is simply the latest pump and dump excuse. 
@_date: 2017-04-22 15:20:56
We may never know. But I do feel that "core" has shown that they are not above playing games just as well as BU/Big blockers. 
@_date: 2017-04-22 14:42:54
Of course they can't. But realistically, do you not think the community with support of the miners could reach 75%+ with a core implementation that brings SegWit now and 2 or 4 MB hardfork in 6-12 months?
@_date: 2017-04-23 00:22:13
Not at all. They are more amateur than ever. Doesn't take much to leak some inflammatory data while holding back the same for our village idiot Trump though. 
@_date: 2017-04-26 02:16:50
Why not go with 100,000%? It can be infinite if you would otherwise run at break even. 
@_date: 2017-04-20 19:24:30
Theoretically yes. But it would still take months for SegWit to implement, run long enough for conclusion and months more before any service started using it.

I personally feel that if you were dumb enough, after MtGox, Mintpal and at least 10 other exchanges being hacked, still kept your funds in Finex after they took 30% of it and gave you "we promise to try to pay you tokens" you almost deserve to lose it all. 
The fact that no Bitfinex owner or employee has been able to even clearly answer what happened is a absolutely joke when you talk $100+ million. 
@_date: 2017-04-21 05:45:23
Pretty please with sugar on top. Take the time to implement a min viable on the main blockhain!!! I have been told over and over again by the core devs that also work with sidechains that SegWit is not a neccessity for implementation.

No downside to having both and letting the users decide usage. Settlement layers can provide zero time confirmation for one and offload transaction heavy apps from the main chain (gambling, dust transactions etc.)

Absolutely. It would definitely be unfortunate for those moving bitcoin during the 'open' fork. But that is also something you have to be aware of as a Bitcoin user should the chain split.

Sit down. It's a previously hacked exchange that 'borrowed' (stole) 30% of their customer funds and have not proven themselves to be solvent, now with banking issues and up to $100 price disparity vs all other exchanges.

@_date: 2017-04-22 14:50:48
Roadmap isn't worth much when they area exceptionally clear that they don't want to do it. Whether or not it matters, there is still a huge difference between a roadmap and developers actually sitting down and agreeing to roll a hard fork into the deployed code at a certain timeframe. 
My point is that core could make this happen and it would be easy. But they don't. 
@_date: 2017-04-24 15:16:17
Yup. Tragically now Bitcoin has lost the first mover advantage on SegWit which I think will somewhat mute the 'SegWit rally' but I do believe a resolution will have a very positive impact on price. 
Honestly, the resolution doesn't even have to be SegWit. Just an end to the shitshow would raise price.

SegWit now, for a promise of fork to larger block size in 12-24 months. If they do, we will have an uncontested and safe hardfork and SegWit immediately MOON!

@_date: 2017-04-19 03:34:00
You must be new here if you think that. How is bankruptcy better than : 30% of customers money, 190,000 BTC, and another year to wipe up after yourself before folding the company MtGox style with a 'we could totally have made it if it wasn't for the banks freezing our funds' (Sound familiar?)

The idea that only a "fraction" of the community understand that performing proof of work is important to Bitcoin is a scary though. If that is the case I guess when the time comes some other coin will have taken over.
@_date: 2017-04-22 15:16:31
And that's the problem. "See SegWits full impact" reads as "if payment channels become popular enough there might never be a hardfork and on chain fees may decrease and starve out miners" if you have $100 million invested in ASIC. 
@_date: 2017-04-22 13:57:53
It's neither. It's simply an understanding that you have to work together. There is no security or performance deficit to SegWit now, and implement a non contested hard fork in the future.

As much as I would like to believe the 'math' Litecoin went from $4 - $14, basically from all time low (in volume trading). Bitcoin is within 5% of all time high already. You can't compare the two like they are the same. For litecoin its a recoil from historically low levels fueled by the attention from SegWit and a sudden influx in mining hash rate. 
@_date: 2017-04-24 14:43:49

@_date: 2017-04-22 14:55:54
OK, not 'ever' but their current tone hasn't indicated any direct interest. I also think they underestimate the community's willingness to accept SegWit + Hardfork as a resolution that would lead to a virtually uncontested hardfork. 
@_date: 2017-04-17 19:41:42

@_date: 2017-04-26 23:11:37
What a pathetic post. Instead of being constructive in Bitcoin he spends his time whining about the fact that Litecoin's founder, developers, miners and exchanges managed to resolve the issues and move to a mutually agreeable solution that the community approved of (99.6% hash power and deep community consensus). 
This is why we can't have nice things.
@_date: 2017-04-26 15:22:04
Not at all. And I don't mean it wouldn't suck for the network or some users. I'm just pointing out that this is an inherent risk of any hard fork, and doesn't require bad actors. 
@_date: 2017-04-23 07:57:26
You aren't being downvoted because you are wrong. The fact is that Core could end this charade if they wanted to. The "miners" aren't asking for anything strange at all. I know several large miners and all they want is a promise of a timeframe for larger block size. 
The reasoning being that SegWit could potentially enable a huge power in determining block rewards from transaction fees. Something that would become even more problematic if blocks were kept small forcing transactions to the sidechannels. 
@_date: 2017-04-28 15:06:45

I don't quite agree with the sentiment. Open source under the right license does the same thing. 
Patenting core technolofy however locks out competing projects since no one would ever invest in a project that uses patented code as a cornerstone even if the patents are supposedly "defensive". 
Even if never used those patents work as an effective competition killer, something that open source would not. 
@_date: 2017-05-03 01:17:23
No I understand that. But strictly legally, there is little that actually stops you from using the patent down the road in a non defensive manner.

Says semi-working Storj-copy valued like a successful startup. Why would they be valued based on all tokens? They are locked for 12-months, so obviously right now they are not part of market float. Investors are fully aware that they exist, they are just acting on available information. There is zero reason to believe that a project backed by as many well known individuals as Gnosis would be reckless with their token reserves. 
If we are going to start valuing everything based on the 'max token' I'd like to see Ethereum valued at 'infinite' and Bitcoin valued on 21 million coins right?
@_date: 2017-05-02 14:51:07
EFF usually vets the companies they "back" well and that will be hard. That said, "it hasn't happened yet" is not a defense that is particularly strong. 
Google started with "Do not Evil" as their motto.. then money happened.
I'm not saying they WILL abuse the parents. And I also am not one of those that think Blockstream is inherently evil. I'm just saying that parents tend to be like guns, just having one makes it more likely that you will want to use it.

@_date: 2017-05-02 20:01:40
I can buy the intent, but one very important difference is what a patent, defensive or not does in limiting competition. 
Open source under GPL can (as far as I understand) give you the same protection but does not have the same competition hampering effect. 
Very few venture capital partners would invest in a project that builds on patented code, while building on open source code under GPL is viewed differently. 
This may of course be unintentional, and the best legal solution might be defensive patents. I'm just curious as to why so many projects large and small seem fine with going with GPL.

Open sourcing under a GPL license offer better protection than patents all day long and outside of that you are covered by prior art etc.

No. Bitfinex goes to $2k, which means almost nothing since what they are trading is some messed up fractional reserve token propped up by imaginary USD-tokens with no contractual value.

Invalid security cert and an author that writes like he's 15 years on Xbox chat.

Because they are criminal cunts that needs to be dropped into a dark hole. 
@_date: 2017-05-01 12:08:41
Is joke.
@_date: 2017-05-02 14:48:44
You do realize that GPL is a better protection than a patent in almost any case. That's why it's so commonly used.

You spent time on that? Jesus kid. Get a job. This is Reddit.

And companies who owns "defensive" parents have never lied or used them agressively. Oh dear..

Praising yourself as "the last sane mod" with your comment history is a hell of a statement. 
@_date: 2017-05-03 13:41:53
You have to be some SPECIAL kind of stupid to say that 'its not stupid' and then replace the number by one less than HALF of what he stated. 
@_date: 2017-05-03 21:54:07
How does that apply to ANY part of this? Past is equal to future? 
@_date: 2017-05-01 23:02:12
Sure, but it's equally retarded to look at Litecoin, that was trading at multi-year low when it started rising to Bitcoin that is trading at multi-year high. Fucking buzzfeed tweet. 
@_date: 2017-05-03 13:43:24
True, but this was an assumption I made all on my own as I have never ran into anyone ever telling me that 'Defensive patent usage' was something legally binding.
@_date: 2017-05-03 11:33:54
These are the kind of stupid assumptions that lose people money.
@_date: 2017-05-02 18:19:11
And that's entirely within their right of course. I just don't quite understand why I guess. Seems 99% of projects are happy to just open source and GPL.

They effectively 'created' $50 million out of thin air to 'pay back' their own customers. Doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that Bitfinex is circling the drain.
@_date: 2017-05-06 18:30:36
Vinny is just a pathetic excuse for a Bitcoin professional. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 11:50:52
Oh dear.. how many illiterates are there here? Read my comment ffs. 'core side' means the exact same thing as "BU supporters" or "big blockers". 
@_date: 2017-05-03 21:53:32
Get a job child. It's not an opinion or a prediction, it's a logical fallacy. 
@_date: 2017-05-03 22:22:42
Oh sick burn. Cause if you don't agree with some autistic 13 year old you obviously support BU. Damn kid.. you must be then pride of the whole litter. ��
