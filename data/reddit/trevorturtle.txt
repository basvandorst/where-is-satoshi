It's difficult to predict the future. Multiple currencies is a more likely scenario than winner takes all because certain people always hate whatever is most popular. Cryptos for speed, cryptos for anonymity, cryptos for security, cryptos for political causes, cryptos for local economies, cryptos backed by real things, etc.

The government wouldn't decide that, their handlers, the private bankers, make those decisions 
@_date: 2019-03-11 03:12:33


You have that backwards.


Yes, because the private bankers don't want their money to be hyperinflated.


National banks, controlled by governments, far out perform value added to the economy than any private bank. Politicians are at least somewhat held accountable by voters. Private bankers have zero accountability.

If you aren't able to see trends and predict how technology evolves, then no one here can help you. If bitcoin doesn't evolve quick enough, then some other crypto will take it's place. But it is inevitable that fiat currency will become a thing of the past. It's only a matter of when.

You're right. Right now, it's not viable. But *the trend* is certain, cryptocurrency *will* become better in every single way. The only question is when.

Tbf, that is natural progression of fiat. Cryptos just help speed it up.
@_date: 2017-10-15 20:30:39
For the people who downplay Bitcoin, I wonder how much of it is due to the fact that they are upset that they feel like they missed the boat on bitcoin and really want to 100x their alts?
@_date: 2017-10-16 04:34:43
It assumes bitcoin won't be overtaken, which doesn't seem out there to me. 
I base that assertion off this article: 
@_date: 2017-09-02 03:04:16
I agree that cryptos &gt; USD, but how are you confident in bitcoin vs. a different one?
@_date: 2017-09-25 16:31:10
You can just sell bitcoin to pay off taxes at the end of the year.

Read this article: 
We are no where near the "missed out" phase.
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:46:00
It's more about what level of risk do you want to take on? 5% high risk/volatility is better advice for old people. Young people stand to have more upside to risk because they have more time to recover if it doesn't work out. 
I agree with your emphasis that this is a high risk investment. That should be made clear to everyone. Therefore, it's wise to put in only what we can afford to lose. But your one-size fits all approach is myopic. It's up to each individual to decide how much risk they want to take on. As long as it's made clear to only put in what you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-10-16 04:31:49


I was referring to you saying you don't know which will be the primary one. It's not about hedging cryptos by diversifying, but so that, as you said, you have more chances of getting the "primary one." 
Not sure what you mean with the rest of your comment.
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:21:29
We'll likely keep seeing this pattern until it's in the 100k-1mm range

6 blocks is ridiculous. Most people say 1 confirmation. 2 if it's a lot, 3 if fraud may be really high and a lot of money.
@_date: 2017-10-15 20:42:44


Diversify your cryptos then.
You realize the bitcoin and other cryptos are a powerful hedge against the economic system, right? You don't need to put a large percentage of your portfolio in, 5% in a high risk asset that is a hedge against your other assets is a good idea, isn't it?
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:27:03
Still would've been smart to put 10-20% into it.

When has making something illegal ever resulted in lower prices? Prostitution? No. Drugs? No. Gold? No. All making something illegal does is make it harder to get, which means to get it you have to pay more for it. Making it illegal will just affirm it's value.

@_date: 2017-10-22 07:26:00
You understand that if that happens, many countries fiat currency will be going to shit as people will be trusting bitcoin more than government backed currency?
It's not necessarily that bitcoin is becoming worth more at that point, it's your country's fiat being worth less.

It's going to be less and less volatile as it reaches universal adoption.

@_date: 2017-10-12 20:15:37


Why do people say this with such certainty?
Wouldn't interests rates just rise to reflect the deflation?

We still have a long way to go. People have been saying it's too late since it was like $1.
@_date: 2017-10-22 07:27:25
And no one would be able to make it better, nope, absolutely no way to change it. No chance it will evolve and improve.
@_date: 2017-10-22 07:21:17
Until the marketcap is like significantly more, it will be seen as a speculative thing that will go up in value. Once it reaches a large amount like 500k-1m+, there will be much less volatility and will work much more like a traditional currency. People are speculating that will happen. Thus bitcoin is overvalued in the short term but undervalued in the long term (assuming mass adoption).
@_date: 2017-10-22 07:30:40
You realize that in traditional investing, 10% gains are considered good, right? If you look at the most frugal financial advisors, they will say you may need 500k+ to retire. Retire on 10k? Lol. 
As adoption increases *risk* goes down. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 03:42:19
Maybe we don't discuss CNN because we don't give a fuck about it?
@_date: 2017-10-22 07:23:05
To give you an idea of how scarce bitcoin is, there are more millionaires in the world than there will ever be bitcoin. I.e., not every millionaire in the world can have one bitcoin. 
500k-2mm a coin is about where it would be if mass worldwide adoption happened.

Marketcap is not based on how much money has been put in the system. 
If I have a crypto that has 10 coins and they're valued at $1 a piece, the market cap is $10. If you want to buy a coin and I won't sell for less than $2 a coin, which you pay, thus raising the price to $2, the marketcap is now $20 (raised $10) even though you only put in $2.
