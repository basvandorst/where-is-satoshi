It's all there on Google, step by step instructions. How hard is it to Google these things rather than asking some strangers for help.

Damn LTC is still bleeding, I am waiting for it pump a bit at least so I dump and buy more BTC

Can we hit $15K + this month. I sure do we will what's your thoughts?
@_date: 2019-07-03 22:59:44
To the moon
@_date: 2019-07-03 23:11:07
The monthly BTC chart looks so beautiful, and if this is still the accumulation phase then the new ATH will be so massive, it makes the old ATH look so tiny lol.
@_date: 2019-07-10 22:06:48
It's going to 80% dominance soon.
@_date: 2019-07-10 22:22:40

This post deserves a medal.
@_date: 2019-07-02 10:35:10
You won't see a $3K BTC again.
@_date: 2019-07-14 17:29:02
How do you know we going to 8K then?
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:34:17
Wait for it, then buy more.
@_date: 2019-07-04 00:06:44
Hahaha did I give so many underscores there

This is very bullish for Bitcoin, we are breaching that 14K next week.
@_date: 2019-07-03 22:45:58
Here we go again ⬆️⏫⏫
@_date: 2019-07-23 10:23:31
Meanwhile in India, they're trying to ban Crypto.
@_date: 2019-07-02 10:39:54
Nothing wrong in analysing, he is just making a living lol. Plus some YouTubers cover the daily news, which some people have no time investing. There are some ridiculous YouTubers out there who just talk shit but there are some good quality YouTubers as well.
@_date: 2019-07-10 22:06:00
Same here, Litecoin is the only Alt left in my portfolio. Will eventually move it to BTC in time.
@_date: 2019-07-21 22:33:52
Finally something original

If you are not long then you are w___g!
@_date: 2019-07-23 10:26:14
@_date: 2019-07-11 07:08:08
Then price might peak when you sell.

Hope you are not storing your Bitcoins on any exchange wallet or some cheap ass wallet app. Get yourself a cold storage and keep the private key safe and secure. Remember “If you don’t own your private key, you don’t own your bitcoins.”
@_date: 2019-07-10 22:19:46
 I invested in LTC due to the halving hype.
@_date: 2019-07-14 06:51:40
Not thin air,based on math
@_date: 2019-07-03 22:53:00
When you see its going up, no work tomorrow, fuck sleep keep watching the BTC chart ��

@_date: 2019-10-26 01:06:32
It's going to happen
@_date: 2019-10-16 20:54:37
The only thing you should worry about is how much Bitcoin you can get while the price is below 10k USD.
The rest does not matter.
@_date: 2019-08-30 10:29:06
He panic sold it, HODL incomplete.

3 full BTC wow.
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:02:37
$12K tonight, most probably
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:47:59
I think a lot of them right now are panic selling their recently bought sats.
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:00:50
The weekly chart looks beautiful
@_date: 2019-08-30 10:29:32
@_date: 2019-06-25 12:44:44
Yeah that's the plan with LTC, had hoped to see some parabolic trend before the halving but it's kinda going up slow.
@_date: 2019-06-29 00:41:19
@_date: 2019-06-30 15:35:29
I live in India and they are planning to ban Bitcoin and the hearing is on July 23 and am nervous. Most of the exchanges in India have already shut down their business, today I took my profits the principal amount that I had invested and holding on to the rest in hopes of Crytpo getting regulated in my country.
@_date: 2019-06-25 11:24:12
Should I sell all my ETH and LTC for BTC or wait? Not an expert just seeking advice.
@_date: 2019-12-27 22:54:58
That's the only way!
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:34:57
Get ready with $14K memes, we are going to see that in a couple of hours maybe
@_date: 2019-12-04 23:03:30
I'd say most of the traders today got REKT!  M-M-M-MONSTER KILL
@_date: 2019-12-16 07:27:05
Dude I don't trade, I am waiting to buy more there.
@_date: 2019-12-10 17:42:19
HODL MY BEER!
@_date: 2019-12-08 11:02:01
That's why you buy Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-12-04 23:01:02
95% of the traders got REKT and it's just another day for Hodlers.
@_date: 2019-12-17 22:24:38
Wow really, that exchange sucks
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:19:25
Moon soon
@_date: 2019-12-15 14:07:22
We are going to to sub 5K by the end of this month.
@_date: 2019-12-04 23:04:40
All got REKT today ��
@_date: 2019-12-30 18:21:00
Got escalated lol
@_date: 2019-12-12 10:48:48
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:57:47
I just hope what you are saying turns out to be true, but the vibes and exchanges shutting down here scares me lol. Moreover the Reserve Bank of India have already banned crypto and banking support to the exchanges somewhere in 2018. I am keeping my fingers crossed hoping for the crytpo bill in India to get regulated. There is one bill that they have submitted which is ridiculous "if you buy, sell, hold, transact or do anything with Bitcoin, a 10 years jail term" wtf, How can they even purpose a bill like this.
@_date: 2019-12-10 23:20:07
Well done sir ��.

Goon we have two more years to accumulate more.

@_date: 2019-09-19 22:15:14
It's an absolute win
@_date: 2019-09-16 18:07:58
It's going zero. Now quickly sell

Did someone die today
@_date: 2019-09-16 18:07:52
It's going zero. Now quickly sell
@_date: 2019-09-20 12:43:05
I think Bitmex is manipulating and making a lot for themselves and exit one day.
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:45:50
This is looking very promising, breakout can happen anytime.
