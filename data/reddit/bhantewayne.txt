Trying to buy BitCoints with CVS or Walmart will bleed you dry.
As for BitInstant, they are still a rolling train wreck.  I spent Friday afternoon and all day today tying to get their help desk to find $190 that Dwolla says was delivered but BitInstant says never arrived.
BitInstant has unspeakably bad customer service and a minimum wage web page.

The support team at BitInstant resolved my problem by refunding the $190 to Dwolla.  I repeated the transfer from Dwolla to BitInstant without error.  
In the original transaction I started Dwolla instead of the BitInstant web site.  The BitInstant log shows the original transaction completed but the next line in the log said "Dwolla IPN failure'.  I went first to Dwolla support.
Any computer (or bookkeeping) system that doesn't allow a complete transaction reversal is not working correctly.  Software can't rely on the user doing everything perfectly.  The IPN failure exception wasn't handled. 
There was a real communication problem with the BitInstant help desk supervisor.  No matter how many times I thought I gave clear, documented answers, I wasn't telling them what they wanted to hear and they weren't saying what I wanted to hear.  A simple communication breakdown in which I share responsibility.
However, the BitInstant staff didn't give up and the next day the problem was resolved.  Because of that I will use BitInstant in the future.  However I will be extremely attentive to their protocal.
