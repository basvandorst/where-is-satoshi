I don't think it takes much of a navigator to see that nobody is going to use Bitcoin to actually buy things when its value might dramatically increase. You need a guarantee that it won't be more valuable tomorrow than it is today. Throwing around crypto-community buzzwords like Fiat doesn't do anything to show that Bitcoin is any different in this regard than any other currency.

Lol it absolutely sounds like a crypto community buzzword.

Right which encourages commerce or, y'know, people investing their money in ways that will allow it to beat inflation. This is why inflation is a critical component of successful currencies. No one will ever spend Bitcoin on a burger when the burger might cost half as many bitcoins tomorrow.

In actuality, I would rather have people spending money on goods and services, or investing it in businesses that create profits and employ people, than I would having them all stash it away hoping they can profit from hanging onto it. Society would cease to function if everyone viewed currency as an investment vehicle.

People invested in gold because they thought it was a stable store of value. People are not spending bitcoins not because they think it is a safe place to store value but because they expect the value of their Bitcoin to increase. This makes it useless as a currency. No one is buying anything with Bitcoin. They will continue to not buy anything with Bitcoin until the value stops increasing. 
I believe that people hoard highly deflationary currency because everyone is hoarding bitcoins. Why would I ever use my money to buy things when there's a good chance that in a month or two it might buy me 1000% as much?

It's very unlikely you'll have to get used to it for very long...
