Shouldn't you be comparing BTC to USD/Yen/etc?  Or is BTC only a currency when its convenient?

I took 2 standard deviations of 2014's closing prices, calculated the mean, calculated the distribution.  The result is the graph.  Before you call bullshit next time, know something about statistics.k?

Don't you think by end of Q2, the Winklevoss $COIN ETF will hit?

If the USD tanked, so goes the rest of the world.  I wouldn't bet on the demise of the US to prop up btc to make it more proliferate.   $3T-$5T of the US debt is foreign owned.  The debt holders aren't going to let their investment die on the vine.

It's interesting to see that while Bitcoin was developed to free a person from fiat paper, that people are speculating future prices to increase their fiat paper.
There are far better investment vehicles than Bitcoins if that's your purpose.  If 98% of day traders lose their nest egg, I can assume 98% of you will do the same in Bitcoin.
I love the concept of Bitcoin for what it was designed for.  As an investment vehicle, not so much.  Bitcoin at this stage is far too risky - it reminds me of the "green rush" when everyone was buying cannabis penny stocks, who have now lost practically everything.

"In 1971 or 1972, Stanford students using Arpanet accounts at Stanford University's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory engaged in a commercial transaction with their counterparts at Massachussetts Institute of Technology. "
Or was '75 or '86?  Did he mean Massachusetts?  Well, you read on it the internet...

I don't see the Winklevoss IPO of their $COIN ETF at these prices.  They definitely want a lower price.

In securities markets the golden rule is buy the rumor, sell the news.  News is all btc has left.

The primary reason BTC acts like a penny stock is because there's not any intuitional ownership in it.  When the ETFs roll in, it should help stabilize this bipolar sob.

Well, it is probability - no one can predict the price action. However, there are sound reasons that probability analysis exists in the markets - this is not a new concept and its used every day.  The point of the chart is to give some basis for price action, which is better than others who throw a dart and say the value is going to rise to $10,000 with no basis whatsoever other than untested hypothetical scenarios.
My analysis may not accomplish anything for you - that's fine.  I'm not serving you - I'm sharing my thoughts the same way you do.  You don't decide for everyone what is valid or not.
Good luck playing darts.

I'm with you on this.  I see btc as more of a rail to move fiat from A to B.  Done right, you could move cash between fiat accounts and settle in the same day.  This is superior to how it is done today.

To me, the price action is going through textbook consolidation on lower volumes.  There are well established upper and lower trend lines as well.  If the price breaks either trend line on above average volume, it should set up a new trend.

They didn't accept your $100 not because they didn't think it was worth $100.   The didn't accept that denomination either because of the high rate of counterfeit, or because large bills attract criminals.  They're mitigating risk of loss.  Sheesh...

The window for mining profitably has passed regardless of the vendor.  If it was so profitable, the vendors wouldn't be selling or renting anything to you anyway - they'd do it themselves.
Why people don't understand this, I don't know.  If you want to earn bitcoins, put your brain to work and integrate your products/services into the platform - forget mining.
