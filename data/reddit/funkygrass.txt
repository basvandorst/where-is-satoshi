Well...hire more people then. I am sure they've got the money for that. I also, have been waiting for a sign of life and they sent me a generic computer generated answer after 3 months. Better late than never they say
I'm not experienced in buying through other exchanges but I am pretty sure that they're gonna be better at customer service than these guys, somehow it's a joke after all the money they're currently making

no worries, no one wants to accuse him of that. 
In fact I am mostly relating to the tone of voice he uses towards the end of the interview which clearly shows what kind of troll he is...prison or not prison
@_date: 2019-07-29 14:26:12
I saw this happening in front of my eyes and as much as I hate manipulation, this kind of volatility has played in my favour... recouped some cash thanks to this...
I don’t mind bitcoin to be the wild west...
Regulate it when it’s a mil per coin, thank you.

@_date: 2017-12-01 16:32:25
I don't want to feel like I am judging him indeed, I am not knowledgeable enough about what happened with the prison sentence, 
my only gut feeling came from after watching the above interview and I only had one question in my mind which is "how can people put their money in this guys' hands"
@_date: 2017-12-30 10:35:54

Sailing the storm...We are the Bitcoin pirates United. I'll stick to my Bitcoin no matter what ����
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:06:02
Uhm I meant something else by saying that...I don't think it's easy to explain but i basically meant that other exchanges do pay back the "wins" in cash...like eToro, my friend did put some money down for Bitcoin but she couldn't send it anywhere. They still own the Bitcoin technically but they make you bet on it...and if it goes up in price and you want to sell, they'll give you back your investment plus the "winning". does it make sense?
Of course you need to get a ledger to store your own coins, that's what I'm doing...
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:44:49
They took 2 and a half months to get back to me, without solution too but hey...
At least you can keep your Bitcoin with them, other exchanges they make you just play with it and the only thing you can claim back is fiat money...
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:56:01

@_date: 2018-06-29 13:00:23
you're just converting your government money "fiat" Into another currency. That's about it. The difference is that this currency hasn't got the backing of corrupted shit behind. Yes, you know who I am talking about. As much as there are whales manipulating the price, that won't last forever, as soon as majority of the planet uses it, prices will get pretty stable

@_date: 2018-06-29 13:21:05
I honestly treat cash as "Monero". Until it's legal to pay in cash of course. And yes I bought a few things with it but I prefer to hold it as I can foresee the value it will have in as short as 5 years from now. It's a whole ideology thing for me, mostly because I fucking hate politicians and governments, they're fucking liars and they lie all the time. And it's all about trust
@_date: 2019-08-29 11:28:12
This could be one. That CW biatch has billions in court proceedings to pay but he won’t apparently be awarded some btc until 21st of Jan. 
This situation has in my mind 2 things:
1) Craight fucking Wright 
2) tether disappearing from total cap

@_date: 2019-01-22 20:15:32
Eventually this is primed to change within the next 10 years. 
My only hope is that btc has really been made by cyberpunks rather than secret services. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 20:18:31
Indeed it won’t replace fiat altogether but it’ll be a know alternative to it... 
If it was going to replace fiat, it would have been deemed illegal already

FUCK VER and his btrash scam...it’s like CO2 in the cryptosphere

I'm not in the US but it doesn't make much of a difference. Here in the EU there is the same level of hypocrisy , they are up to the same shit... big corporations and rich men get away with bonuses instead of paying taxes, at least majority of these people. In the meantime they cut funds to public health services and other things. Why shall I pay taxes when they do whatever they want with it. I am against paying taxes to be honest.

@_date: 2018-02-01 20:59:11
well hard to make a distinction here but I believe most of us have maybe wasted those 5k to buy at least one BTC....
What about those people who can spend a million in fiat on BTC and not worry about it....
Do you think those individuals do really care about decentralization?

But it doesn’t mean that eating it will make you healthier.

@_date: 2018-02-02 00:42:37
I might as well although if you know the purpose of Btc was indeed to give back to people some financial freedom...
Now...nobody's fault if us humans are likely to push things always towards exploitation....we exploit anything. Pussy included. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:18:52
1st of February 2017...1 BTC equals 960.05 Us Dollars as Stated on Coinbase...
What are you pussies crying for...it's not down past that amount. 
Just admit it to yourself: "I am in love with Bitcoin and I don't want to let go of it"
@_date: 2018-02-12 22:23:27
They kill people with your money. They buy arms without your consent. They fund wars with your taxpayers money without your consent...
I can say only one thing or two...fuck the taxman, the government and the fucking banks  
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:00:44
Ok I am sorry I am going to correct myself: maybe it will not eradicate it but what about those people in 3rd world countries who cannot have a bank account for whatever reason. That's just one example...
Think about Zimbabwe and Venezuela for example...

@_date: 2018-02-11 16:07:49
Well that's grand then! Good for you!! To own more BTC doesn't necessarily make you a better person though..
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:57:43
I like the tech but I also like decentralisation...I'm tired of these middle little men and Bitcoin will just squish them... I'm not a developer yet although I'm studying Andreas antonopoulos book. 
Even if they are newer coins coming with "better tech" either they're based on BTC script or they're just being developed on an idea previously developed (like uummm... BTC?) hence why the amount of work put in them it's less in comparison...coz the idea was already there. Blockchain and crypto came together so let them be together. 
And you can say anything about new coins but I find it hard to trust any of the other coins to be honest as people are behind them...
If Satoshi Nakamoto would reveal their identity tomorrow, sure BTC would likely crash for good. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:28:27
sure but doesn't a reasonable person think that when something is surging so much, something must stink of fish....I was looking at those prices feeling content but also "hey, I don't deserve this!"
There's no such thing like quick money....look at what happened to people with Bitconnect...
People who got in at 18k got in quick because they thought they were getting into a "get rich quick scheme". Like my mates....they're licking their wounds right now of course and I am honestly sorry for them. Honestly I am.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:02:36
it stabilized at 10 dollars some years ago and It went up to 20k so you might want to review your theory
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:16:22
I love Bitcoin...
It's gonna eradicate unfairness in our society.
That is a fucking big deal my friend
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:30:00
I am in other coins too...
I just have respect for the godfather
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:29:44
indeed they do. they do so in order to stimulate the market...
That is the only form of manipulation we can possibly have with BTC...
greedy people with a lot of money want to drive the price lower so that they can buy quite a chunk. 
when you buy 10 btc at 9k instead of 10k each, at the end of the maths you'll see that the greedy rich bastard has also saved 10k in fiat money for the same amount of btc.
That is fucking clever isn't it 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:03:10
These greedy pussies who want quick cash by crashing Btc, should leave Bitcoin...It's time to get real....no get rich quick scheme here...stay in only if you believe in its technology. I do because I really want to show the mid finger to the banker
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:25:18
If i cared i would've sold...at loss...
Yes true I have the same number of btc....but how much NEO, Verge, ltc and all the rest will I need to afford ONE btc....that's the question
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:36:12
why are you all so full of pessimism...I just believe that we are clearing the bad guys out. Besides the graphs are telling us that the beginning of the year there's always a bit of bull run. 
Why should an alt coin be worth more than BTC when they all come from Bitcoin's script.....come on guys
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:23:15

Lol, that's not a good start of the year if you keep looking at the glass half empty
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:19:58
believe it or not the solution is simpler than you think: 
don't be weak handed and hodl til you'll see the system crash and burn again...
We will talk then what a btc is really worth. And yes fuck the alt coins too....better noone behind it than people who can manipulate it, there is only a certain degree of manipulation that can take place with BTC but soon it's gonna get expensive for bankers too, don't worry...
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:33:37
that's a decent move for sure I am not commenting on that. 
Selling at loss isn't always bad....This only depends on how much you have enjoyed the ride yourself....it's very personal I guess
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:48:43
Hey nothing wrong if you need to cash out for your whatever of your own needs. Just saying this about people who purposefully tank it....in my dictionary that's called greed
@_date: 2018-07-18 09:58:05
Spend em all on blips and chiiiiitzz ������
@_date: 2018-07-09 08:41:44
True but I believe whoever is not set to stomach some risk right now that we are in the early stages of adoption, then won't benefit as much as people who have studied the whole matter.
I am a low income person too and I change every spare money into Bitcoin.   but I don't have a family to maintain right now so that's kinda easier to do. However, if I had one and kids, I'd probably change 10/20 bucks on a weekly basis into btc. Anyway this is just me, I see a lot of people who know the name "Bitcoin" and they're scared because they have never really understood what it is hence why they're careful with the money they spend on it
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:56:54
Nothing wrong with that...
I could have cashed out at 20k and I held on to it thinking that It was gonna surge even more so I am greedy too.
But I have not sold a single Satoshi because I am thinking about 5 years down the line from now...
@_date: 2018-07-18 00:27:29
The guy who wrote this post is a legend. He's helped me recover 4.99 LTC from a Bitcoin address... I was new at the time and sent them to a segwit Bitcoin address. I tipped him 1 LTC for helping me out

@_date: 2018-02-01 21:01:41
Hodling is not always the best solution but It is in my view for BTC.
and prevents it from tanking.
There's just a limited amount of manipulation that can happen with BTC
The rest of the coins can have huge manipulations behind just because someone is behind them
@_date: 2018-07-17 22:29:43

@_date: 2018-04-04 13:02:18
That's right, it was an EasyJet flight and there are other pages talking about crypto...I took snaps but I didn't want to spam Bitcoin page, also because other ones were pretty generic but still all about investing in it. 
On the other hand, I was travelling home from another flight the other day and while I was on the train from gatwick airport (UK) I saw at a tube stop the big poster Ad saying "Have you ever invested in Crypto? la di da" I didn't have time to take a snap but I was like "Hey!!"
@_date: 2018-04-04 12:59:09
Well, that's good. These sort of companies are pretty parasitic at the end of the day...It doesn't take science knowledge to own some BTC. Isn't it supposed to become a day to day thing? That's why I am not even turning my stake back into fiat

But if I were you I’d be like “screw it” and do that extra mile to buy some btc...
You’ll pat yourself on your shoulder in a few years time... 7k is still good (it will pop and we are going back to 4K) compared to what we’re going to see in the future.
