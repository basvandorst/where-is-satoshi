Yes that is decentralization.
Participants are functioning as independent nodes instead of relying on a centralized authority. On the level of independently hosted web servers the Internet itself is also decentralized. Centralization comes in when loads of users rely on a single server/service.

"Why is everyone so upset about it?"
I'd like to add that this issue appears to have become a tool for outside forces to try and split the bitcoin community and delay progress by spreading falsehoods and mistrust and attacking the core developers. Lots of new reddit accounts appeared that are actively spreading a theory that Blockstream is a conspiracy trying to somehow capture the Bitcoin protocol for financial interests (part of this plan is supposedly to keep the blocksize small). All of this in angry tones without much technical substance and a lot of (intentional?) misunderstandings about LN.

So the allocation of new money is not set in code and decentralized? Can someone give a source on how it is done (not only rumors)?
@_date: 2014-07-29 08:00:21
True. But they still have the amount of money being transacted to work with. I would be happy to use a mobile wallet that let me buy small stuff without extra hassle but demanded extra verification in case of larger transactions.
Edit: One way to know a legit address from a bad one would be a case where the bad address has been hardcoded into a virus or something similar.

I don't understand why people pay so much attention to the Bitcoin foundation. Let them do their thing. They are free people who have the right to pursue their goals with the methods they choose. It doesn't mean that anyone has to trust them. (Based on the stuff I've seen it looks to me they have done more good than bad.)
But by all means let's continue building decentralized systems that can perform the same functions the foundation is supposed to and more. We don't need to first somehow get rid of or discredit the foundation in order to do this. Decentralization is the future and in the end there is nothing anything can do to change that.

All the alleged murders (5) that were being handled in NY (and would have been part of the currently ongoing trial process) were dropped. (why would they have been dropped if there was some grounds to them?)
The one that is being handled in Maryland is still standing. 
I assume this is because the Maryland charge enables the Feds to imply there is some evidence of him having hired a murder. I further assume that this charge will also be dropped before it is time to actually present the evidence.

The reason why you think so is because of state propaganda: someone breaks a window and they call him "anarchist". Vandalism doesn't have anything to do with anarchism. Any mental link between these concepts is an evidence of successful propaganda.

You can pay however much per transaction you want. If you can't, switch to another client. In the end the miners decide which transactions they prefer to include in the blocks and that is their freedom.

I see Bitcoin, Ethereum, NXT, Maidsafe, etc. all being in the same team in the big picture. Together they are a threat to so many ancient institutions. The whole segment of decentralized cryptosystems will grow together and eventually replace multiple existing institutions.

The premise in your analysis was that the motivation for the 51% attack is to make money. If this is the case I agree with your analysis.
But there could also be another kind of scenario where the purpose is only to disrupt the network by preventing transactions from getting confirmed or something similar. Very expensive, yes... but not if you have all the taxpayers' money to play with. Any thoughts on this?
@_date: 2014-07-24 08:20:18
Bitpay offers a great service, but I don't know why people make it seem like volatility is such a big danger. For me it seems like the exchange rate in the medium-long term will greatly favor BTC to dollar, so I would recommend keeping the money in BTC. Also look into directly using those coins for whatever you collect the money for. You can buy surprisingly wide variety of stuff with BTC already.
@_date: 2014-07-17 00:04:29

Yes that is for the initial 100B coins (for which I see no reason not to trust that the non-profit will distribute as it has promised). I was asking more about the annual 1%. Those are meant to be allocated based on community vote.

Its an open source software, not a centrally controlled service. So much misunderstanding about this flowing around :(
@_date: 2016-01-19 08:44:56
I agree.
There is something that has to be understood about competing hard forks though, especially if the developers behind them are not as capable as the core devs are: They break the core scaling roadmap and for sure cause delays for these more advanced features in the middle-to-long term. It is easy to shout for a "bigger blocksize now!" but it would be smart to acknowledge the bigger picture here...
Edit: It should be clear without saying but I still say it that 2mb blocks are not a long-term scaling solution and cannot really be compared with LN-type stuff.
@_date: 2016-01-17 07:25:21
Increasing the block size doesn't come without consequences (bandwidth and diskspace requirements, block propagation speed, etc.). 
You can also get more TPS with other means like segregated witness. And even more with LN and some other more advanced ones the bitcoin wizards are trying to figure out.
The 2mb blocks by themselves don't sounds so horrible to me. The main point is that these more advanced scaling efforts can be harmed greatly, if the software is forked into the control of a new group of developers who don't have the technical capacity and will to work for them or to coordinate with the current core devs.
@_date: 2016-01-17 04:28:54
Well, the miners sure would prefer bigger block rewards and its they who decide which software to run...
@_date: 2016-01-17 04:54:03
(I meant banks and governments have done the hiring.)
How is it the PR going for the core devs? Not too good. Which is understandable as their competence is in coding and the opponents (banks, govts, whoever?) have much more resources and energy to spend on reddit sockpuppetry and vote manipulation. And it really shouldn't be a part of the job description of someone like Maxwell to use his valuable time for this kind of stuff. We as a community should be smart and educate each other when lies are being spread on these forums in order to vilify the developers (have a look at Will be interesting to see how this all turns out and how effective such attack vector turns out to be...

@_date: 2016-01-19 01:11:38
True. That is the main issue here. 
I for one happen to trust the people who have been working for years building what we have today. I'm worried that if the classic fork manages to win, the core scaling (and pro-privacy!) roadmap will be sabotaged by incompatible features that would need another hard fork to undo.
@_date: 2016-01-18 16:52:37

@_date: 2016-01-17 01:47:28
I just hope people understand that a significant part of the "political and diplomatic subtleties" involved are result of intentional manipulation and effort to split and create conflict within the bitcoin community.

@_date: 2016-01-19 08:16:43
If it makes Bitcoin scale to ~VISA capacity and it happens that it enables some other parties besides miners to also make money by relaying the transactions, is that so bad. It seems to me everybody wins... (Perhaps that is why there is such a big campaign to demonize these more advanced Bitcoin developments)

@_date: 2016-01-17 01:26:45
They just recently committed to a scaling roadmap which includes segwit, that increases the capacity more than a simple 2mb blocksize bump.
@_date: 2016-01-03 14:18:35
Not to mention that Ethereum is still PoW at this point.
@_date: 2016-01-19 10:42:05
The delay comes from the situation where the network is running code that is incompatible with the core repository changes and maintained by a group that is not co-operating with the core developers.
@_date: 2016-01-19 00:40:39
Blocksize limit is not a meaningless arbitrary handicap. Sure it can be raised some but that method of scaling will never come close to the scale enabled by LN.

True. Power is the main issue here.

Hello Erik. You have lots of influence in the community and I trust that you also have the best interests of Bitcoin at heart. Therefore I would appreciate if you consider the following observations:
By having a glimpse at anyone will see there is a big movement to vilify and alienate the core developers and to resist changes in the protocol that are needed for a real scaling solution (LN). I'm afraid this proposed fork to switch the de-facto client repository out of the control of the core devs will end up being a big step in aiding this movement and hurting/slowing bitcoin development when if comes to more advanced features.

Re: mining fees: So what? The primary purpose is to scale, not to make money for one group or another.
@_date: 2016-01-17 04:22:47
The constraints are purely technical. Sure everyone would want unlimited transactions per block with 1 second blocktime with a client that uses 1kb/s bandwidth and 1mb disk space. Too bad its not possible. And it takes people with deep technical understanding to figure out how to get the best possible result with the constraints we have to work with. Economists don't help much here.

It should be clear without saying that general users are not technically competent enough to make decisions about protocol design.
@_date: 2016-01-18 07:23:15
Not once the transaction is confirmed (= in the blockchain). And transactions never were to be trusted if they're not confirmed. 
It all depends on which transaction miners decide to include in a block in case they receive conflicting ones.

This doesn't have anything to do with Bitcoin protocol. Anyone can start collecting Bitcoin addresses on their own database (or notebook) and label them whatever way they like. Why anyone else would care is another matter.
TBH I don't know why people are so interested in this whole news. Why is it such a big deal that some have plans to ban some of the Bitcoins when everyone has known since the beginning that governments can at any time decide to make all use of Bitcoin illegal if they so choose...? 
Nobody can control the bitcoin network itself no matter what kind of lists or laws they choose to create. In this regard nothing has changed.
One interesting scenario to think is what would happen if some core devs implement this (or some other) kind of bullshit into the protocol itself and thus cause a major competing fork...
