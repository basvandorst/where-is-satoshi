Lucky circumstance.

Unless you want to use an exchange.
Far easier to track than cash.

Nearly useless as a currency now.

So it's cheaper to pay billions in salaries, compared to powering a thousands of  computers?  Then you have to consider the trillions in extortion fees when a too-big-to-fail bank fails..  Interesting theory.

TIL there are people that think the economy is not rigged or manipulated.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:56:08


Which one would that be?

You can trade commodities, sure.  You traded a box of nothing for a used car.  You can trade a carton of eggs for a jug of milk, that doesn´t mean eggs are currency.  
And if you bought a car, I assume you paid for the title transfer, or associated taxes, and declared how much you purchased it for?

Because it´s valued and traded in FIAT currency.  PWC is a global financial services organisation.  They deal in all sorts of transactions.   BTC is an easily transferrable commodity.
As for your contract, I doubt its legality.  And if you don´t have legal title of that car, then it´s not really yours.  I´m not sure where you live, but most places require a title transfer, and payment of associated fees and taxes.   
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:10:01
True, but they don´t disappear when the power´s out.  Also, you´re comparing a currency with a commodity.  
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:58:21
Bitcoin has no value except to those who dumped money into it.  
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:51:46
Ah, so you really don´t have title of property for the car.  I certainly hope it´s a legally binding contract.  So really, you´re just indefinitely renting the car, it´s not really yours in the legal sense.
So you wrote down the BTC amount?  Or did you write down the dollar value of the BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:42:21
So BTC value is FIAT based, so it´s a commodity; a digital commodity.  If it was currency, by definition it would be widely accepted.  Oh, and on your contract you only listed BTC, let´s hope it´s FIAT value doesn´t sky rocket by the time you file your income tax report.  Then you might be liable for more tax than what you paid for the car initially.  Oh wait, right, the car´s not really yours because you don´t have title ownership.  
That´s a tough cookie.

Interesting, so 47.66% usage outside of Jewelry.  Mind you, not sure if you've noticed, the value of the gold, once made into Jewerly can skyrocket far beyond it's value as a commodity.
@_date: 2018-12-15 17:57:39


There's your third party.
@_date: 2018-12-15 02:11:25
Gold has an intrinsic value, bitcoin does not.  Gold is a useful industrial resource.  Bitcoin has no functional value outside of its intended use.  Its only value comes from what people are willing to pay for it with fiat currency.
Bitcoin doesn't need registration to be used, unless of course you want to trade it on any of the online exchanges to and from a usable currency.  No intermediary required, aside from all those nodes that verify transactions, and the network they connect to.  So they say there will never be more than 21 million bitcoins, until of course you start fractioning them into the thousandths of a decimal place.

Unnecessary quotes.  Yes, $50 intrinsic value, the rest is speculative.  Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, only speculative. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 17:56:12
Your response adds nothing to the argument.  
@_date: 2013-01-24 17:36:35
Why would USG or DOJ go after bitcoin users?  That's like going after car owners because cars are used as getaway vehicles in bank robberies..  This guy is, for the lack of a better term, just another rush limbaugh - somewhat articulate but far from intelligent.
@_date: 2013-01-24 17:29:01
It's theft..  so it's not ethical or moral on any level.  Neither was the sale of your botnet. You may think that you're "mining" bitcoins, but really, you're just stealing other people's resources. 
@_date: 2013-01-24 17:31:25
This article is a joke, right?  Or is it just the author?
@_date: 2013-01-24 17:25:44
Not only is that not ethical, and not only are you stealing, but now you're delving into extortion.  People like you is why we can't have nice things.
@_date: 2013-01-24 17:32:54
Once a BTC wallet is gone, those bitcoins are not recoverable.
