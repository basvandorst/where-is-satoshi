A bunch huh? You peasents come and buy like 0.006 btc...and then u panic sell it all. Grow some balls and buy big amounts. Stop spending ur lunch money allowance on btc.

Whales arent mythical. Theyre real. And they come in all shapes and sizes. Always wish I had bought more then. Always will.
@_date: 2019-07-17 01:11:13
Thats cuz all the altcoins are TRASH and these young kids go and spend $10 on xrp and all the other garbage and think they will moon like btc does and then they panic sell once they lose $5. Too many peasants in this market as a whole.
@_date: 2019-07-17 11:48:58
Already dropped below it
@_date: 2019-07-27 11:46:07
Go see the list of wallets with more than 1000 bitcoins. Its public.
@_date: 2019-07-27 02:53:51
There is no we. Just whale.
@_date: 2019-07-10 23:05:07
I mean if youre selling when its dropping you’re just straight retarded....but great job anyway.
@_date: 2019-07-17 01:14:56
The reality is a lot of people come and spend peasant amounts on crypto which I pray is at least on bitcoin and not on the other 99% shitcoins that are on the market. They spend their $10 lunch money allowance on XRP thinking its going to moon and then they panic sell once their investment $5 in the negative (thats a 50% loss for you noobs) and they cant buy french fries from the cafeteria the next day...save THEN invest properly. Dont be coming in here screaming from joy that youre an investor when you cant afford to play the game. 0.0007 satoshis is not investing in bitcoin. Its throwing your money away.

@_date: 2019-07-09 10:41:18
Yeah but I want it to be higher. I want the price at 80k at least.

Lmao i see it as it is my friend. I dont live in a fantasy world. I like crypto but in a realistic way. Its not bible. Using crypto in that transaction for the car could also have caused a million problems. Transaction could have taken days if the market was moving, one letter off on the wallet and the money would have been untraceable to both, and most important of all, liquidating that cash for fiat, because again, lets be real here, people need to pay bills. Its just not there yet. 
@_date: 2019-03-07 12:07:06
Just write a damn cheque. Fiat is king. Its not going anywhere. 
@_date: 2019-03-03 20:25:59
Doesn’t really need the vertical strikethrough. Its clear as is.

When the fuck is this trash going into a bull run. All this red is getting old real fast.
@_date: 2019-11-24 12:41:28
Fuck that only looking to get rich
@_date: 2019-08-16 11:22:34
Yeah eh? Your part time paycheque at a fast food joint? So ur gonna buy 0.0000005 btc huh? Sure we’ll wait.
@_date: 2019-08-16 12:31:16
But come on, realistic or a pipe dream, we all want bitcoin to be at least $16,000,000 and climbing at some point. Lets be real.
@_date: 2019-08-16 12:02:48
The sun will rise and the sun will set.
@_date: 2019-08-16 12:04:47
Not only are there 2nd class tickets to the moon, theres also gonna be live video streams for most of the people who dont invest big enough to watch from the comfort of their gaming chairs...u need substantial skin in this game to see any significant profits when this pops off. Otherwise just like 90% of this sub, your lunch money will get stolen when you panic on the drops. I get sick of seeing posts about “ermgherd wait let me buy” when they buy such low amounts...go big or go home. 0.0006 bitcoins is not an investment, its a waste of money.
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:15:45
LETS GO

Hes only endorsing crypto cuz he has like
Billions of dollars lol
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:50:37
Yeah I’m on board with that. I see it as a lottery. I’ve put in what I can afford to lose, quite a lot less that I can afford to lose to be honest, but still a substantial amount. So we will see. Ive already weathered 90% drops. Not worried in the slightest.
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:49:33
Just enjoy the ride up or down. You’re a part of history now.
@_date: 2019-06-20 12:05:03
What about like 250k in 10 years? Like can we at least have some fun with this? Its a lottery for me so I want to have a realistic expectation of where it can be in 10 years. What would you say?
@_date: 2019-10-15 19:08:34
Why the fuck isnt this shit moving up

Keep it down junior. Trying to catch some shut eye.
@_date: 2019-09-12 19:05:32
Market is performing like trash. Am I selling no? Who throws their lottery ticket out before the numbers are announced? Waiting for some idiot to buy my bags at 10x or even 100x i paid for it. Until that day.
@_date: 2019-09-06 12:53:40
You. I like you.
@_date: 2019-09-12 16:27:11
Market and hype has been dead for months. So boring.
@_date: 2019-05-13 12:48:07
If i had 50 btc I wouldnt ask when lol. Im in the 21 mil club tho. So I better be retiring at 50 if the prophecies are true.
@_date: 2019-05-19 21:38:33
Heres to retiring early.
@_date: 2019-05-12 12:56:52
Im retiring at 50
@_date: 2019-05-10 19:16:51
Should one sell all their alts for .5 btc?
