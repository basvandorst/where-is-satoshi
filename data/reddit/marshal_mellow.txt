Everyone is saying its a hacker, but it could easily be someone with access to that server who decided to run a miner to earn some money with the extra resources on the server. Seems plausible its someone trusted with access.

because in the block chain where purchases are published there is no mention of what the money was for.  
You could maybe prove that someone had been making a lot of money in bitcoins but that isn't illegal.

People who don't like the idea of a hard drive crash making them lose money. (I know you can back it up but some people just suck with computers)

Couldn't you get 1000 usd in bitcoins sent to your wallet? if bitcoins are worth 1 cent each (according to mtgox) you could get 100k bitcoins.

Actually you quite easily could lose your biometrics. DNA is the only one I can't imagine losing.
You lose your hand? No fingerprint scanner
Lose an eye? No retina scanner
Broken bones in your face can render you unrecognizable to facial recognition.
So you could get in a car wreck, and wake up half blind, one handed, disfigured, and unable to pay your bills.

I like malware, what is the mtgox_client? Can I has it? I wish to study it and see what it's doing. Who knows maybe I can get some useful info from it.
