Do I really have to go into how purse.io saves you money? Hint: It's not because of bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:25:55
I don't think blockstream is great. I go to and see the other side and I'm left opting for the turd instead of the douche. 
I agree with you. the money has been stolen and likely washed through varying alts by now. Their is no recovering of the money. We can recover the bitcoins but not the actual value he stole. This would only make economic sense for bitfinex and people who got burned by the hack. Makes no sense for anyone else who is involved in bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-08 17:01:01
Until they open up their site again for withdrawals or trading, they'll be taking criminal action and authorities will step in. Until then, it's just a hack. When they are unable to make users whole, that's when people step in.
Right now they are just buying more and more time with their intern Zane taking all the heat.
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:54:12
Is this proposing that we actually do what everyone has been joking about doing and fork to recover funds like eth did?
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:11:31
What communication? has he revealed one single thing that another party didn't reveal on here first?
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:36:05


No shit you stupid bastard! That's because it would have been our fault!
Absolutely criminal dude. Absolutely fucking criminal. Holy shit.
If only Mark had taken this approach, we'd still have MT gox running today.
You guys make Mark look like a really good dude.

Too lazy to look it up but I believe they were founded with 148 millionish when they started. That lasts quite a while just paying software developers
@_date: 2016-08-04 03:00:46
Dude is continuing to work for a company doing super shitty things. No sympathy whatsoever. I could care less if he wants to taint his reputation by being the front guy for this disaster. That's his choice.
If he actually answered some important questions, instead of just confirming things other people figure out on their own and telling people "Here's the update: We hope to have an update soon", then I'd go easy on him.
You guys have to realize that he is voluntarily being front man of a criminal company right now. Why you guys are behind him baffles me.
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:44:59
Agreed on colleges being a scam. 
Too bad the kid is taking the side of blatant criminals or else I'd be 100% behind him.
@_date: 2016-08-08 15:26:30
I agree it's probably the right thing to do but I think it shows they are still clueless on how they got hacked or what was compromised.
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:52:16
He is typing out bullshit responses dude. We all reddit everyday. It deserves zero praise
@_date: 2016-08-11 01:15:48
Everyone still wanna thank Zane some more for posting on reddit?
These guys are crooks. Every single one of them. How they are allowed to open the site back up is beyond me.
@_date: 2016-08-10 04:38:47
Yes, bitfinex will buy them up fo rpennies on the dollar and their debt will magically be repaid.
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:34:23
I'm a director and my salary is not all that great. Titles are just titles. He has no more than high school education and a year at CU boulder. 
He does however look like and come off as a well intending young kid. That's a great face for criminals to hide behind, and who knows what they pay him for that honestly.
Lastly, don't forget he was at OKcoin first. Competitor info is pretty valuable.

Because people review it. Instead of with upvote/dowvote system, you get an actual monetary backed voting system essentially.
I could see that certain number of people paid this much to download and are happy with the download. Easy to fake happy downloaders. Harder to fake paying downloaders. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 15:11:34
What a bunch of amateurs.
These guys claim no user account info was compromised and that was not how the hack took place.
Now they are making users set new passwords and configure new 2FA in order to get back in.
Clearly they are worried that stuff might have been compromised. They have no fucking clue what is going on. These fuckers need to be in jail and fast, before they steal more from their customers.
@_date: 2016-08-10 15:30:52
There are already orders on the books and price shows .80 usd/bfx now.
So you guys are getting your low orders in, hoping to buy back all the debt at a fraction of the cost eh? Just like everyone suspected. What a scam.
@_date: 2016-08-02 01:29:34
I don't think we are quite on the same page. I think OP listed a bunch of potential applications that haven't came through yet. Maybe they never do.
However, I never said they were only used for speculating. Darknets and internet gambling are big industries. Bitcoin is clearly the best option for both. Those two markets alone are enough to justify current price IMO.

When the community realizes that finex is saying "sorry for your loss" and their CEO is going into hiding, they might wake up to what really happened here.
Right now the sentiment is "Oh zane you are such a hero for typing stuff on reddit! Sorry you guys have to deal with this treeible situation!"
Meanwhile Zane just announce they are going to be fully operational again very shortly.
When the community stops acting like Bitfinex are victims, I'll shut up.
@_date: 2016-08-05 17:04:03
That may be but does speak chinese. 
Really you just need to be a patsy for criminals to hide behind.
@_date: 2016-08-08 17:31:12
He's assuming all uploaders get paid and therefore wouldn't do it for free elsewhere.
I feel like his is completely missing the other half of that equation though. He needs people wanting to pay for downloads instead of getting them for free elsewhere. 
If there are no ads all over every page, and downloads can be verified to be malware free, I might be willing to pay a small amount for that. 
Oh well I'm excited to see how it works out. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 18:07:36
Ah all the apps that have near-zero use currently. What a great list...
The actual apps that drive current market demand: darknet, gambling (primarily sportsbooks), speculation, and wealth storage/transfer. 
Of course we don't list the real applications that bitcoin shows profound advantages being used in because we are afraid it will taint bitcoin's public image or something. 
They are all pro-freedom applications and I see no shame in that.
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:13:22

Zane's non response here should tell you guys all you need to know.
No real authorities would possibly allow them to socialize losses between a select group of their customers before investigations and audits were 100% complete, guaranteed.

Just curious if one single person didn't get fucked by this.
@_date: 2016-08-04 02:58:27
Sure it's the user's fault for having funds on there. It's a known risk.
However, the exchange throwing their hands up and saying "welp... it's not our coins!" and then continuing business as normal is downright pathetic and the community should be aware of what is really going on.
Imagine if MtGox had just said "Welp, not our bitcoins!" and then continued operations.
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:24:00
For everoyne involved? No this is bad for the users who got robbed of bitcoin. Bitfinex will keep running as normal, Zane will get his same paycheck for his redditting services, and bitcoin itself is going to be just fine.
Finex just lost $60m+ of user's funds and are getting ready to keep business running as usual and do nothing to compensate users. Why do we feel the need to act like they are victims here?
@_date: 2016-08-05 18:49:28
When you have access to the orderbooks, including hidden orders, you are able to deduct exact amounts of coins that need to be dumped or bought to cause liquidations/stops to occur. Absurdly illegal and unethical to trade on such information. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:35:09
Holy shit...
If only Mark had taken this approach, MT Gox could still be up and running today.
Oh and he would have to get a 23 year old to man a reddit account too of course.
@_date: 2016-08-05 18:52:35
Sure would be suspicious if one of Finex's employees used to work there. Oh wait...
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:02:41
I want attention rightly focused on finex and for the community to stop shrugging and saying "well that's bitcoin!"
@_date: 2016-08-08 22:18:35
Meh uploaders will try it. Why wouldn't they? Then if they actually get paid they would probably continue to do so
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:27:03
He's still basking in that phase where users try to pat him on the back for communicating his notices of further communication because they are secretly hoping they can miraculously get their funds back.
If he revealed they lost 95%+ of users' bitcoins, then people wise up and start asking real questions. That isn't as fun.
@_date: 2016-08-01 21:45:38
Purchase volume still negligible. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:37:01
That's fine and I knew all that and still traded with them. However it says a lot about who he/they are. These people are greedy crooks, not victims.
@_date: 2016-08-02 02:40:36
What advantages does bitcoin offer for buying and selling of general goods? 
The only one I can think of is the potential money that merchants save on credit/debit card fees. 
I've bought pizza, I've bought starbucks, I've bought stuff on rakuten, I've bought stuff on overstock, I've bought games on steam. All with and without bitcoin. For none of those applications did bitcoin save me time, money, or complexity.
We can all sit here and dream and dream about how awesome it would be if the whole world decided to use bitcoin to buy and sell digital goods, but until I have one single merchant experience for general goods that makes me go "Aha! bitcoin sure made sense there!", then I'm not even discussing it.
However, I have had that moment with the other applications I mentioned. If only the bitcoin community embraced the true use cases that make sense.
@_date: 2016-08-04 19:28:29
Because they think that by thanking and kissing the ass of this guy for his reddit comments, they are more likely to have finex not rape them in the ass. If Mark K had hired a high school educated intern to spam boilerplate responses on reddit, everyone would have been behind Gox too it seems. 
Anyone who upvoted him saying they won't take any losses has not been paying attention to what he has been saying at all. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 03:03:50
Ok so you were hacked but they stole our bitcoins through your hack. Makes total sense!
I could have swore they would have to hack me to steal from me.
For any other company, this is blatant insolvency and you are liable for the funds, but you guys are criminals.
Now in your defense, your terms are very upfront about being criminals, so I'll give ya that.
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:59:53
Typing meaningless stuff isn't transparency. You haven't said one actually revealing thing about the hack in all of your last 100 comments.
"We are continuing to look into it" is not transparency. 
@_date: 2016-04-27 16:10:40
No it's actually their role to lower the price by about 2% a year.

@_date: 2016-08-03 19:30:58
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:31:46
I am being constructive. As you can see from the community is just recently (last 30 minutes or so) waking up to Finex saying "Sorry for your loss guys!"
I'm actually communicating what is going on here. Zane has communicated not a damn thing of value.
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:43:20
$60m + stolen? Don't worry, we'll get this 25 year old kid to type stuff out on reddit and the community will be thanking us for how "Open and honest" we are.
After all, it's amazing they would do us this great service when finex didn't even get hacked. Their users got hacked, not them (according to and it's just so awesome they are willing to vaguely answer things on reddit for us anyways. Heroes of the industry, lemme tell ya.
@_date: 2016-04-29 19:20:34

Coinbase can be fine, depending what you are using it for. If you are using it to store .7btc and not do anything illegal with that, then you are fine.
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:30:27
What you are suggesting is insolvency. Mt gox style. Yes it's the right way to go but they aren't doing that.
If only Mark Karp had known all it took to stay solvent and have the community behind them was say "they weren't our bitcoins!" and hire a 23 year old to post on reddit.

100% agree but expect downvotes cause people still clearly expecting to get money back.
Notice how the narrative here has continually shifted more and more against bitfinex with the more details they release. Nobody wanted to bash them when they stoll thought they might not be getting fucked because their coons weren't hacked or they didn't even have bitcoin on there. Now it's clear that they have no feasible way to remain solvent. 
As soon as they allow withdrawals and trading of their token, they will be committing criminal acts and they know that already. This is all just stalling and more stalling.

Think about it this way:
If you had a product that could be used to literally generate money, would you sell it for any less than the amount of money it could generate? Of course you wouldn't. Bitmain doesn't either. Therefore you know that your cost of acquiring them will certainly be, at best, the same money you can expect to get out of them.
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:21:23
Is that true? You would think some of the Core team would have made that more clear as it is a great argument for people needing to be able to run full nodes at as low of a cost as possible.

Not necessarily. Could mean they just want Coinbase's impact on the market to be lessened, hence not using them or recommending others to use them.
@_date: 2016-04-21 15:58:27
Heh they better bribe those miners some serious $$$$ cause the price would absolutely plummet and mining sure wouldn't be profitable.

You guys know that brian armstrong has admitted to being personally invested in ETH much more than BTC, right? 
So this shouldn't surprise anyone. His ETH investment is doing very very very very well since he has had the option to implement SegWit + Batch payments and has chosen not to. His ETH investment would not be doing nearly as well if he had implemented those two things ASAP.
@_date: 2018-01-30 07:05:13
Why would they sell money makers for less money than they make? If they were "extremely profitable", they wouldn't bother selling them. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:18:07
As opposed to the completely publicly owned mining sector that is about 60% Bitmain and it's child companies?
When Bitcoin users value low fees over the perks of using coinbase, they'll go around coinbase, and therefore around the dependence on them to scale.

If they let it be regulated enough, it will offer zero advantages over the actual dollar. Tether has the use case of not being heavily regulated. Sure, it's scarier, but there is also great utility. I don't know what utility an equally regulated dollar is gonna provide.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:36:31
The drama is "We want bigger blocks!", "Can we try SegWit first?", "No!". Core's approach has straight up not been given a chance to work. 
The plan was horribly delayed when mining pools started signalling BU and shit instead of segwit, then we finally got segwit, now no one will use it for political reasons. 
Hell, we even have a version of bitcoin without segwit and with bigger blocks, in case segwit ruins everything, and STILL, no one will use segwit. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:03:03
I’ve heard countless stories of lost bitcoins. I’ve heard zero of forced violent theft of them. That’s the topic.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:54:57
This is straight up false.
It has to be used as a transfer of value and store of value. Transfer of value does not necessarily mean spend. If I transfer my bitcoin from one website account to another that I own, I've utilized it as much as anyone who spent it on something, and I didn't lower investment or have to buy more.
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:11:50
Not all transfers of wealth are for purchases of goods. 
If you need proof, the price of bitcoin is at almost $12,000 and it’s completely impractical to buy legal goods with it.

If there is demand to borrow the printed money, it should allow the supply of money to increase with the value of that money staying almost the same (-2% or whatever). It's what has allowed us to print off billions of dollars over the last decade without the value reflecting that astronomical price increase. 
The day the dollar collapses is when people don't want to borrow it anymore. This is why debt is self propagating. If everyone was out of debt, the money wouldn't have value. The system is designed to keep a certain portion of the people in debt so they can keep fueling the bubble through interest and inflation.

Having money in THE crypto feels a lot better than feeling like you had to pick one. Why should Bitcoin maximalists be excited the price is going up unless they are selling? If altcoins have less and less market share, the price of Bitcoin is only more and more guaranteed to go up in the long term.

Well that's half the reason. The other reason is they are a business looking to lock in profits, not to speculate. They would rather hold their profits in fiat for that reason, regardless of bills that need to be paid.


It's kind of a chicken and egg problem, and I don't think there is a clear answer what the first step is. If my favorite pizza shop started accepting Bitcoin, I wouldn't pay with it. I would have to either give up some of my bitcoin to do that or I'd have to rebuy it, both of which are less ideal than just using my credit card.
I don't think there is a first step, personally. I think it will just take time. It will take time for more and more people and businesses to feel comfortable hodling BTC, and that will develop alongside merchant adoption. The earliest merchants and consumers to adopt it will be taking the greatest risk, but there are already those people taking that risk. I'm one of them. Overstock.com is one of them.

Long time bitcoiner, long time hodler. I still don't know why the hell I would want to spend my bitcoin at starbucks or microsoft unless there is a significant discount involved. Using a credit card is easier, faster, cheaper, and doesn't require me getting rid of my btc or having to buy more btc (paying fees to do so.)
This is just as non-news as when steam accepted it or when they stopped accepting it. Just as non-news as the first time microsoft accepted it.
This is not spending bitcoin because starbucks and microsoft will not hold the bitcoin after the sale. This is not spending bitcoin because your typical bitcoiner will not want to actually spend his bitcoin, instead he will likely purchase more bitcoin after, ultimately resulting in that consumer having spent fiat.
TL;DR This is a really stupid way to spend fiat at starbucks and microsoft.

If someone has 10 BTC and they wanna reduce their exposure by half, they could send 1 BTC to bitmex, sell 5 on margin, pay .001&amp; fees, do it instantly, and be able to close that margin position just as quickly and cheaply as they opened it.
Or they could send 5 BTC to coinbase/gemini/bitstamp/bitfinex and sell those for fiat, pay at least 10x as much in fees, make the decision to either have their money wired to them a week or more later \(then have to deposit that money again when they wanna buy back\) or hold that 5 BTC worth of fiat on the exchange until they want to buy back.
Hmm... I'll take send one BTC to bitmex in order to minimize counterparty risk and then pay way less in fees Alex!

@_date: 2018-08-02 16:03:40
It will age just fine for a while. It's going to take a lot longer than people would like to accept for businesses to truly accept (hold) cryptocurrency payments. That would cut out the merchant needing to use a bank to receive payment. It will take even longer for people to get paid in Bitcoin, which is the only way you eliminate the need for the user to use a bank for the transaction.

99% of merchants you can spend bitcoin with right now are "getting out" immediately, which puts the money flow in the third graphic.

Absolutely genius tweet storm that really sums up so much so well.
My favorite part:
15.1\) Now I'd like to get back to a more general topic. I honestly think it's a clear sing of stupidity to fall for the old, typical, standard, obvious trick of populist conspiracy theories! These theories are all very similar, &amp; they all basically go like this:
15.2\) "the world would be perfect, everything would come for free, w/o any scarcity, any sacrifice, any trade\-offs...if not for an evil minority who creates ARTIFICIAL scarcity trade\-offs, all to get some power over us with extremely complex &amp; not well defined machinations!".
I know a certain subreddit that genuinely believes there are no trade offs involved, and that the whole world can just have free and instant transactions, with no need for confirmations, on a globally verified public ledger. They genuinely believe the trade offs are manufactured by Blockstream and co.
@_date: 2018-08-03 20:02:36

This is no more gambling than the person who just sells 5 BTC on GDAX or who just buys 5 BTC on GDAX.
@_date: 2018-05-02 23:22:01
Well the beautiful thing about hard forks is that anyone can do them. If you or anyone else genuinely believed that the majority supported a hard fork away from Core to bigger blocks, then they should have simply committed to a hard fork. Satoshi designed a beautiful system of consensus centered around PoW. 
I think the claim that blockstream, this subreddit, and bitcointalk mods all managed to completely subvert the PoW mechanism is retarded.
Almost as retarded as creating a fork that bypasses the consensus mechanism (EDA) like bitcoin cash did, and then claiming it’s bitcoin.

Sell 10 BTC through GDAX if ya want man. Hard pass for me.
I can assure you there are many many good reasons to do it on margin rather than sell your BTC outside of gambling. 
You can use stops to avoid. Or maybe you don't mind the risk of liquidation, because if the price shoots up 1000%, now you were 9 BTC long for most of that rise (1BTC used for margin got liquidated.) If you had just sold 5 btc outright, tough luck.

Luckily miners' profits depend on two things: Bitcoin price, and transaction fees.
A hardfork with the slightest bit of contention would cause a large price drop, at least in the short term. That hardfork's goal would also be to reduce fees.
Miners aren't going to hurt the price and their fees for a temporary, contentious scaling solution.
This ecosystem is complex, but generally you can just follow the money to gauge everyone's intentions.

Any number of things could drop the price below $1k. I would even argue right now that if nothing at all happened in the bitcoin space over the next couple weeks, we could flirt with $900-$950 again just to test our lower bound of this range. 
That doesn't mean buying at $1000 is a bad idea though. At least not if you aren't planning to sell anytime too soon.

Not only that, but finex is also setting themselves up to be able to reacquire the "stolen" bitcoins, and then they would actually be able to actually use/sell those bitcoins without them being blacklisted. With all of those coins being tracked by almost every major exchange, I see no way an independent hacker could ever cash in on those coins.
However, Bitfinex is setting up to be able to cash in on them nicely. First they repay everyone who they took the 36% haircut from. (Well, by "pay back", I mean pay them back at $600 per bitcoin, since they aren't paying users back BTC, they are paying them back dollars. And when I say "everyone", I mean bfx token holders exclusively.) They have almost accomplished this part. 
Then when they have "everyone" "paid back", they get the "hackers" to agree to anonymously sell them back the bitcoin at a highly discounted rate. Finex has already put a public offer to do this out there. 
Now you might be asking yourself "Well shouldn't they give those bitcoins back to the people who's accounts they took them from?" Yes they should, but they've set up reasoning for why they won't, and it goes beyond just bfx tokens. Not only do they now get to claim that they don't owe those customers anything because they gave them bfx tokens, but they've also started the trading of RRT tokens, which will be redeemable for recovered bitcoins. All they have to do is ensure they are the majority holder of RRT tokens, and then work out some anonymous deal with the "hackers" to make it look like they talked the "hacker" into getting their coins back. Then, whammy, 120k BTC of value, and they look like heroes to the general community.

They have to hide it because of fears of a 51% attack. I personally don't see any logic behind why someone who mines more than 50% of newly mined bitcoins and who has invested serious money to do so would want to attack the network in any way. Regardless, the market is scared of the possibility, so they have to hide it.

Well getting paid in it changes a lot. You don't have to deal with the costs of acquiring bitcoin, and even if your paycheck is slightly less because of that cost, you don't get the choice of whether you pay that cost or not.
So yeah, for you, spending it on stuff might be a useful and cost effective thing. How many bitcoiners would you estimate get their full salary in bitcoin.
Of course, this all ignores the deflationary aspect of bitcoin. Assuming you bought at least some your steam games a couple months ago, then you would be wealthier had you spent fiat. Spending the deflationary currency will generally not be the wise choice when both options are available.

If BU would simply increase their consensus level to 95%, then I'd sit back and ignore the whole thing and trust that the market dictate consensus one way or another eventually.
I'd be for any wacky ass proposal that asked for enough consensus behind it. Gavin and Ver's stance has essentially been "Well if 3 of 4 agree, then the 4th would be forced to agree" Which is simply not consensus.

I agree. I think the higher hashrate coin will win out. I think the lower hashrate coin would be easily destroyed via an attack on the smaller hashrate network. That is my whole point. This is the power that miners have.

Kind of a pessimistic way to look at it. Maybe SegWit really just isn't needed that badly right now. I don't think this scaling thing is really the emergency people make it out to be. More time spent testing it would probably be beneficial.

If that's how the miners feel then they should fund a development team that can provide a reliable alternative to run on. The problem is you won't find a competent team of developers who think a hardfork to bigger blocks is a worthwhile thing to do. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 20:39:39
Let's not.
UASF should be a last resort.
If a non negligible amount of the network doesn't want SegWit, we don't get SegWit. Since when is the bitcoin we've had for 8 years suddenly no longer good enough without SegWit?
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:57:07
I can't see killing off bitcoin being beneficial for anyone, especially Ver or Jihan. I think the notion that altcoins are a hedge against bitcoin is  naive. If bitcoin is killed off in any way, including miners being able to show that they have sole control over consensus, then it's gonna set other cryptos back to square one IMO.
I do agree that Jihan's primary motivation is control of the network.

The funny part is they won't even agree with you on this much.
It's particularly amusing to take them down this little train of logic:

"And in the case of a double spend, which one is the bitcoin transaction?"
"Uhhhh.... Uhh.... I don't know! I didn't really use any logic when I declared 0-conf bitcoin payments as valid bitcoin payments!"

Their ability to twist narratives to suit their causes (their wallets) has been beautiful really.
Let's spam with blocksize bullshit and then when they start filtering out some of our spam in order to keep the sub useful, let's claim censorship. Let's them twist that "censorship" into clear evidence that they have secretive financial motivations.
Let's refer to a team of developers releasing open source code and asking for 95% consensus as centralization. Let's refer to our centralized mining attack vector as decentralization.
And now we get a beautiful new one today over in the other thread:
Let's spin this bug into clear evidence that Peter Todd is a malicious actor trying to sabotage bitcoin! How dare he review our shitty code and then make this announcement public!
@_date: 2017-03-15 16:54:03
I think this is the comforting theory we would all like to believe, which is that we vote by running nodes. 
The reality is that miners will never adopt software simply because nodes support it. 
The only real way to force miners' hands is to drop the market price and hurt their business models. But that's a shitty way to have to vote because no one here wants to sell their coins.

They have about 14.4% of the hashrate. If 36% of the hashrate joins them, then they would be able to achieve the "consensus" to validate their blocks. I think it's an empty threat with the primary goal of political maneuvering, but the threat is certainly not to mine invalid blocks. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 22:19:06
Furthermore, many of those people value to 21m BTC cap above all else. I am one of those people.
If an extremely vocal minority can successfully force a hardfork for something as minor as 6tps instead of 3tps, then that's a sad day for bitcoin. 
On top of that, they claim their motivation for the fork is that fees are too high.
So you have a vocal minority who would have successfully forced a hard fork for a pathetic and pointless 6tps upgrade from 3tps, at the cost of a large blockchain and more bearing on nodes, with their argument being "fees are too high!"
Fees are part of the system. It's the ENTIRE THING that makes the deflationary part possible. It is all the miners will have to motivate them to secure the network eventually. 
So yeah, if a "fees are too high!" group can force a hardfork for a pointless kicking of the can down the road (2mb blocksize), then I will have zero faith in the 21m cap.

There is a segment of a medium post from today where he basically implies that miner reward halvings are hurting miner business models and that the fee system should be designed to keep miners from being impacted by miner rewards.  It's not directly stating that we should get rid of halvings, but it's the same line of thought that will get you there. 
Furthermore he implies that user fees are too high but that miner fee revenue dropping too much puts the security of the network at risk. He expects to solve this with EC, where miners would dictate block sizes and adjust them as they see fit. Of course, we know from Jihan's continuous mining of empty blocks that the most outspoken BU favoring miner cares not for miner fees nor for keeping user fees low, so expecting them to balance fees and block size in any sensible way is ludicrous.


Medium post here:
It's clear these guys don't like bitcoin the way it was designed, I just wish they would make their own "vastly superior" coin and stop trying to attack bitcoin.

The whole voting with your coins part isn't so fun if you aren't able to sell within 5 minutes of the actual fork plans being announced like the smart money will. When Bitcoin is at $300 or so waiting for the fork, how then does one "vote with their coins".
The fork is the attack. The fork is the goal. They don't care what happens after that.

They won't fork. Miners don't want to see their profit margins go down by 90% overnight. This is just another political move. The price would surely decrease to $400 or lower in the short term, and miner's would be receiving less fees due to bigger blocks. 
Maybe in the long run it works out for them, but it's a huge risk to their current business models.

Doing nothing is the better alternative IMO.
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:47:51
Right. Changetip.
The problem with that system IMO was that you basically gave negligible amounts of bitcoin to random reddit users. The problem with this approach is that you are giving bitcoin away to people that didn't ask for it in any way.
It would be nice if there was a way to tie a bitcoin address or wallet to our reddit accounts such that I could anonymously pay you some bitcoin for a quality post and vice versa, but only if I already knew you were a bitcoiner. Obviously if you have an address tied to your account, you are a bitcoiner. This way it doesn't look so much like a "Here is some bitcoin that I value so much that I'm giving them away for free." but instead would be more of a "If you like my post, I value bitcoin, send me some, thanks" system.
@_date: 2017-03-27 19:46:45

Furthermore, if they thought these things were the driver behind Bitcoin's value, they would create an altcoin with these features and expect it to pass up Bitcoin's value in no time. They don't though. They focus more on trying to leach from the value that Bitcoin already has.
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:17:06
Definitely not, or else they would have done it.
In the podcast debate between Ver and Johnny (from blockstream), about blocksize, Ver has to step out early, and a BU developer steps in. Meyer essentially asks the BU developer, "If core did everything that BU does, exactly as BU does it, would you support it?" He says no. 
It's 100% political at this point. They view Segwit being implemented as a step backwards in their political maneuvering. They don't give a flying fuck about actually scaling. I mean, for crying out loud, the leading miner of empty blocks is the biggest vocal supporter of BU. It's fucking pathetic.

Miners with long term aspirations aren't really worried about market price at all. It's more about maintaining a competitive advantage over other miners in terms of cheaper equipment, electricity, etc.
A lower price in the long term should theoretically lead to the miners with the least of these advantages dropping off first, and then difficulty/hashrate adjust such that the sruvivors are profitable again, regardless of price.

I have no goal of replacing fiat. Fiat is really good at certain things, such as buying certain goods and services. Furthermore, bitcoin is currently terrible for certain things, such as buying certain goods and services. It's currently terrible for buying coffee with for example. I hope that changes, but I'm not banking on it. I think bitcoin can have tremendous value and utility without replacing visa. I don't like the implication of this post, which is that bitcoin is dependent on being a visa/paypal. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 21:06:43
I've said it before and I'll say it again. No one ever planned to actually use this shit software. Ver doesn't want to use it and Jihan doesn't want to use it, and the two of them make up all the "hashpower" (signalling really) behind BU. 
Go check out the price of DASH/ETH if their motivations are still unclear to you.
@_date: 2017-03-15 17:58:47
Plot bitcoin price vs BU hashrate and plot DASH/ETH price vs BU hashrate and I'd bet good money the latter has higher correlation.
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:54:12


It's the miners that need to budge, not this sub and not the other sub. Not the core developers and not the BU developers. Nearly 50% of the hashrate is simply not voting one way or the other. 
The price has been going up and up more over the last couple months, so why would they? They get more profitable each week. They were also likely concerned with taking a side making the price actually drop.
Well the market needs to voice it's opinion to the miners, and that opinion can be neutral of BU vs Core. The market can simply voice "Make a decision!".

I'll certainly sell off my holdings long before the fork and then play it by ear after that. I'm not just gonna ride it out and risk serious money for funnies though. Ver and BU have demonstrated that one means to attack bitcoin is a social and political attack. One that doesn't require more than a small group of people with shared interests. If that's enough to damage bitcoin significantly, in terms of market share or hashrate, then yeah I've lost faith. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 16:09:39
I just love how BU defenders try to argue that you cannot even compare a supply cap increase with a block size increase, even though both changes stim from the same source, which is miners wanting to ensure more revenue. 
If there is one thing and one thing only that got me interested in bitcoin and keeps me invested in it today, it's the finite supply cap. If we remove that, then bitcoin is no longer bitcoin to me and I'm out.

What site did you withdrawal from? 
In the last two days alone, I've processed withdrawals from Localbitcoins, Nitrogensports, and blockchain.info. Blockchain.info was the only one I could set my own fee on. I opted for a .0005 fee and it went through fine. The localbitcoins transaction took over an hour, which was dissappointing. Nitrogensport's withdrawal went through great.
Genuinely curious who you withdrew from.

@_date: 2017-03-28 16:23:56


No we shouldn't. 
TL;DR The goal is to stall scaling and create FUD. There are zero actual plans for a hardfork.
There are two separate goals with BU for two separate parties. 
Jihan wants to maximize fee revenue and suppress the price. Maximizing fee revenue is more short term money. Suppressing the price ensure that the miners with the lowest amount of efficiency advantages in the market will drop off, Jihan's highly efficient operations (he manufactures his own equipment) will grow in market share, and his profits grow and grow and grow while he seizes more control of the mining market. Many other miners are happy playing along with this as long as they too remain profitable and are able to increase their market share.
Roger Ver on the other hand has one goal and one goal only: create FUD, while also nonchalantly but consistently injecting the propaganda that altcoins will take over. See this post for the best example yet: 
If you can't see Ver's motivations with that post, then you are helpless.
However, an actual fork hurts both of these goals. Furthermore, the buggy code and lack of actual hardfork plans shows that they have no intention of actually forking. All they are doing is signalling for BU. There is no proof they are even running BU.
Altcoins are primarily traded against BTC. If the bottom falls out on BTC, there simply isn't enough fiat on exchanges to prop up bitcoin and altcoins in price. 
For the miners little game: Obviously if they hurt bitcoin badly enough, their businesses go kaput and they are left with warehouses worth of useless mining equipment. They know that an actual contentious hardfork would do this.
@_date: 2017-03-22 17:15:58
Let's see..
No replay protection? Check.
No agreed hashrate threshold (verbal or in the code) for a hard fork? Check.
Poorly reviewed code with plenty of bugs? Check.
BU hashrate doesn't drop when BU bugs are found or when exchanges announce they won't support BU? Check.
Obvious attack? Check.

Yeah I understand that approach. I've never personally had someone express that the difficulty of using bitcoin or setting up a wallet was what was holding them back though.

If someone was interested but unsure of how to get started, then I would certainly help them out by getting them set up and sending them a trivial amount.

@_date: 2017-03-29 16:30:12
I agree depending on the hardfork.
If BU would simply make more of an effort to show they are waiting for any measure of real consensus before performing the hardfork, I wouldn't even mind. A hardfork at 80%+ BU hashrate with a 2-3 week grace period? Sounds good. 
However, tweets like this one make it pretty obvious that they will start playing games as soon as 51% is achieved.
@_date: 2017-03-15 21:02:59
This is one version of "centralized" that I've never understood. How does coinbase being able to offer off-chain, cheaper bitcoin transactions make bitcoin itself more centralized. What if 500 different companies offered this service. Still centralized?

You still miss my point. The upside post fork for either chain is less than current price IMO. So if Core chain wins out, I would expect it to be at about $500-$700. So anyone who doesn't manage to sell pre fork is fucked regardless IMO. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:52:07
I agree it's a stupid baseless claim based on a tweet from a nobody.
However.... there is plenty of money to be made off this in theory. You short and short and short some more, then you just start making a contentious BU fork more and more of a reality. The price would plummet, you close your short, sell all bitcoins, buy ETH and start mining ETH with all your mining hardware.

Nah I love bitcoin. Have most of my wealth in it. I just don't like paying unnecessary fees to trade it for goods. Store of value first, currency later. Once it's an established store of value, merchants will be willing to accept it directly and hold onto it. At that point, many of the expenses and hassle will be removed. Furthermore, second tier solutions will enable instantaneous merchant transactions that don't require the 10 minute average confirmation time and network fees.

Because selling your coins is a vote that directly impacts the miners. UASF is trying to subvert the miners role in the network. 
I agree with you.
Most people just don't want to sell their coins in order to get miners to act, but that might be what it comes to. It's a crappy way to have to vote, but surely more effective than the node nonsense.

To the big blockers, yeah it seems like a compromise.
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:14:51
Even more dubious than that, it is a "threat of 51%" attack IMO. I believe they have no goal of actually forking. Their lack of a concrete hardfork plan, along with their refusal to fix bugs in the software indicates this much pretty clearly. 
The whole plan is to create a threat of a 51% attack, which in turn leads to FUD, which is very profitable, primarily in the altcoin market.

Well on one hand you got developers releasing open source code and asking for 95% consensus, while letting every single node, miner, user, and wallet software remain functional participants regardless of if they go along with those changes.
On the other hand you have people trying to force a contentious split on the network somewhere after 51% hashrate is achieved.
Pretty obvious to me which side wants the power.

Well they have shifted the goalpost such that now their original proposal looks like a compromise. That was the whole point of BU.

First of all, it's extremely frustrating that people who "spend their bitcoin" think they are doing anything different at all. Jimmy is just being smart about it. When you use coinbase or bitpay at a merchant who accepts bitcoin, to pay in bitcoin, coinbase is just selling the bitcoin for fiat for you, and giving it to the merchant. 
Most bitcoiners want the exact same vision you have. Paying for coffee and pizza (and anything else) with Bitcoin. Right now, that's simply not possible unless the shop selling the goods or services holds the bitcoin. If the shop immediately exchanges the bitcoin for fiat (99.9% of "bitcoin merchants" right now), then you are not fulfilling that vision anymore than Jimmy Song's description here. 
And when do more and more merchants start choosing to hodl bitcoin? When it proves itself as a store of value (or at least a good investment) for longer and longer. You can't really rush something proving itself as a store of value. It's happening every day though, and we will get there eventually. 
Second, even when Bitcoin is a proven enough store of value to be held by merchants, thereby closing the consumer to merchant circle, using an on chain transaction will not make any rational sense. It takes on average 10 minutes for a transaction to truly be secure, and a bitcoin credit card (that doesn't use fiat at all) will surely be the most practical way to spend bitcoin, just like a fiat credit card is more practical than cash in 95% of applications. We won't even need LN or anything. Just a visa sort of deal

Which is why no change should happen. Contentious hardfork and UASF are equally stupid ideas. Decentralized consensus is a very tricky thing to pull of on non-trivial design changes. That's a good thing.
However, I don't think consensus is as far away as it appears. If BU or Segwit or any scaling proposal could achieve 60% or more consensus, while the market reacts positively to that development, I think a lot of the other side would concede just for the sake of moving forward.

There is no reason to use bitcoins on Amazon, period. Nobody has a problem buying stuff on amazon. Bitcoin does not make buying things on amazon cheaper or easier. In fact it is harder and more expansive. The only reason purse.io gets you a discount is the illegal trading of amazon gift card credit.
The peak of bogus and worthless merchant adoption, as this would be, was in 2014. It was a joke. There was no use case. There was no problem to solve. There was no motivation for people to use bitcoin. 
Meanwhile there exist many applications that actually provide practical and beneficial use cases. Gambling, darknet, ransomware, speculation, capital flight, and store of value.

It's really the primary way that the users and holders get to influence the ecosystem. Right now, miners' are making record levels of profit. They see no need to do anything. If the price drops to $600 suddenly a lot of them aren't even profitable anymore. Then they might get off their ass.

Bitcoin has a million actual use cases. None of which are buying video games or coffee. Many are illegal or slightly illegal. Plenty of merchants and plenty of users.
The coffee/video games things won't make sense until the circle closes (marchants hodl their bitcoin and pay their employees in bitcoin), but even then, the benefits of using crypto over a credit card are going to be extremely marginal at best. As it currently stands, using a service like bitpay to buy your bitcoins you just bought on coinbase is an extremely expensive and pain in the ass way to ultimately just spend fiat.
There are a lot of people wanting to design and plan on bitcoin solving problems that don't need solving, such as fast and cheap payments for legal goods and services. I'm a realist, and it doesn't make sense or offer any advantages for that.

@_date: 2017-08-22 19:29:21


Is this something I can sign myself up for? Honest question. The cost of purchasing bitcoin for an american is absurd. If I could just have my paycheck auto converted, life would be way easier, but the only ways I've seen require fees that are right at the same level as buying the bitcoin would be.


What cc fee? Just got back from weekend flights, didn't pay any cc fees for the tickets. I'll keep destinia in mind next time I fly.


A legitimate use of a gold bar is throwing it through a window or as a paperweight. The point here is that cheap and fast payments is not a problem for people in the first world. A secure, decentralized, pseudo anonymous, deflationary, censorship resistant store of value that also functions as a network.... not that's something the first world doesn't have outside of crypto.

I love how I've detailed how you guys make money to you over and over and you can't even engage in the basic math behind it. Then you just keep making personal attacks towards my credibility and "self reflection". I just fucking told you how. Ask the fucjing criminals who pay you maybe? Open up a spreadsheet and do the basic math behind Recovered money - losses = profit. Sum up your losses then sum up what you would recover, both in dollars, and whammy, profit! You can do it! 
I've detailed over and over and over to you exactly how you guys gain money from this hack in multiple ways, regardless of if you guys performed the "hack" or not. Go check those lengthy comments I've sent you. From trading fees on customer debt (bfx tokens), to insider trading of customer debt based on information that only you guys have about the likelihood of bfx token redemption. And the most blatantly criminal one: denominating customer debt in the form of dollars and not bitcoins, even though you guys lost customer bitcoins and not dollars. You guys who get $104m worth of bitcoins back from hacker after the bounty. 
I make sense to lots of people. That's why you generally get laughed out of here when you show up trying to promote new exchange features while your bosses have yet to work to inform the public at all about what the fuck went on with the hack.

Right. Or anyone who held bitcoins on Bitfinex and was a direct victim of the hack, who chose to secure their remaining funds and withdraw them from bitfinex, or any user who wanted to hold bitcoins instead of Bitfinex tokens, are no longer victims in Bitfinex' eyes.
Basically Bitfinex said "if you want some of your money back, you are no longer a victim in our eyes and we owe you nothing."
Fucking criminal.
@_date: 2018-10-11 01:11:43
Sure but you can't force that vision unless you can force people to want to hold bitcoin. Once merchants are happy holding their revenue from bitcoin purchases in bitcoin, then we can do that. It's gonna take time.
@_date: 2017-01-27 19:22:56
Burden of proof is on the parties responsible for losing $110m is customer money. That's Bitfinex.
You don't get to withhold information and then debase someone's criticism/suspicions because they don't have that information.
Furthermore, the withholding of that information is largely what makes the trading of bfx tokens and RRT token unethical. It's not an even playing field. You guys have that info and can speculate on those tokens accordingly. Others can't.
But yeah keep using "we haven't given you the information for you to make these claims so your claims aren't valid!". Something a criminal would surely say.

TLDW -
Ver approaches bitcoin as a business. He wants to grow it, he wants to sell it, he wants to create value. He prioritizes user base and allowing the system to grow. He wants the system to be prepared for the best, which is that everyone is using bitcoin tomorrow.
Heart approaches it form the cypherpunk/coder/engineer perspective. He wants to secure it and make it as immune to attacks as possible. He wants the system to be prepared for the worst,  like the Chinese government attacking it.
Ver believes it's actually used for commerce. Heart believe's it is not being used for commerce on any significant level but instead 99% speculation and store of value.
And there you have it folks - the big block vs small block debate in a nutshell.
Hats off to both participants for remaining mostly respectful during the whole thing.
Ultimately if you realize that the arguments for both sides come from extremely different places to begin with, you'll see why finding a middle ground is so hard. Both sides of the debate have extremely different priorities and goals.

As it currently stands it is not good for it, no. Decentralization and censorship resistance is more vital.
Bitcoin cash is great for it though. You'd think there would be more than 20 transactions a block if you thought there was any real world demand for those applications. I don't think that demand is there. It's fabricated as fuck. See anyone buying coffee with litecoin, bitcoin cash, dash, or ETH? Nope.

They cannot sell anywhere. HitBTC and ViaBTC are only place they can sell. 
Much better to not allow deposits of BCH to your exchange, know how much the exchange has available for trading and when you will allow BCH deposits. With that info you pump the price to maximum levels and sell as much as you can for maximum price. Then you open up deposits and let the price crash back down on it's own.

@_date: 2017-01-28 17:07:11
Exactly. Merchants have to be willing to hold it (has to be a proven store of value), and then merchant applications will actually make sense and offer advantages to other payment mechanisms. As is, merchants are primarily just using a payment service like coinbase or bitpay to immediately exchange their bitcoins for fiat. This makes the whole process inefficient, expensive, and frankly quite stupid. Store of value first, mass adoption later.

When bitcoin offers a real advantage over fiat in those kinds of transactions. 
Part of that will involve merchants actually wanting to hold the bitcoins they receive for their good/services. Right now there is too much hassle and too many fees associated with accepting bitcoin and then just selling it immediately for fiat. Makes it a pretty worthless but novel exercise. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:08:24


Oh let's prioritize the 0.00001% of bitcoin users who work for a bitcoin company and get paid in bitcoin. Let's also pretend spending bitcoin makes sense because this tiny fraction of the community doesn't have to pay 1.5%+ to buy bitcoin.


So, no CC fee for anyone traveling like a normal person. 


You are a constantly internationally trading bitcoin dependent person dude. These problems literally are problems for you and maybe 50 other people tops. In the 99.9999999% majority of people world where people get paid in fiat and can use credit cards more easily than they could use bitcoin, cheap and fast is not a problem.
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:08:23

@_date: 2017-01-27 18:42:13
Lol right?
Worse than that though. They have now lost to date $110m to the hack. They claim to owe customers $72m. If you took your remaining money away from them, they tell you they don't owe you anything anymore, but instead they owe the anonymous party who bought your debt. Largest holders of that debt being bfx themselves. 
THEN they come argue with the people who's money they lost and accuse them of character deficiencies. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 16:24:52
We can design for that ideal scenario, we can plan for it, but we can't pretend it's already here or even close to being here.
If you wanna spend $5 of your deflationary store of a value on a steem game just so you can head over to coinbase and spend 1.5% to buy that $5 of bitcoin right back, go for it, but let's not pretend it's cheaper, faster, or easier than just using fiat, and let's not pretend you are spending your bitcoin. You are spending fiat and using bitcoin to do it.
When merchants are holding their bitcoin and not converting them to fiat immediately (overstock says they are half doing this already), when you and i get paid in bitcoin, and when consumers aren't worried about missing out on bitcoin gains, then using bitcoin will make a lot more sense. These things are far away in reality though and by the time we get there, I think second layer solutions will pretty much solve this niche.

An application where bitcoin not only offers zero advantages over traditional payment mechanisms, but arguably is worse.
People who host their property on airbnb get to rest assured that property damages and other fees/fines will be able to be charged to the renters credit card. With bitcoin you would either need customers to use a backup credit card alongside their bitcoin payment or they would need to put money/bitcoins in escrow.
Also using bitcoin would likely be 1%+ more expensive. 
Is this still 2013? Why are we celebrating use cases that make no sense whatsoever? 
Bitcoin can solve many problems related to fiat. This is not one of them.
@_date: 2016-12-09 20:26:04
No the property is your store of value. The fiat loaned to you is a medium of exchange proportionate to the value of the property. 
If you got that mortgage in USD, it would inflate about 2% a year. Not the best store of value IMO, but yes it would be a store of value. That doesn't mean the property isn't a store of value too.
@_date: 2016-12-02 18:54:37
Or they keep holding the bitcoins because they believe the price will simply keep going up like Wikileaks did.
In either case, holding profits in a highly volatile and speculative asset like bitcoin is not something most non bitcoin companies will be doing anytime soon IMO. 
Still, spending bitcoin is no better than holding bitcoin as far as bitcoin promotion goes IMO. Wasting extra money and time to buy a game off steam or order a pizza is just a wasteful exercise, although maybe fun. When a company finds a way to actually offer bitcoiners a real incentive to use it, then by all means spend the shit out of it there. Online sportsbooks have found a way to do that and low and behold over in , it's basically all they use.
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:57:03
Sounds like a hard chopstick if only one branch survives. Bah duh chuhhhh
I think the bigger point here though is that a true hardfork is basically only supposed to have one winner because the minority chain would be killed off due to lack of being able to discover blocks. Since BCC/BCH change their mechanisms on that, it's an altcoin.

@_date: 2017-01-24 19:50:13
It's not so much about people wanting to save bitcoin more than spend it or sell it. It's more about companies being willing to hold it, or better yet, wanting to hold it.
When they are willing to hold it, they can bypass payment processor fees from coinbase and bitpay. Then accepting bitcoin payments should be cheaper than credit card payments. Then they can pass those savings onto the customer, which will encourage them to spend it. That's the first full circle that needs to be completed. The missing link in the loop is merchants being willing to hold bitcoin. Bitcoin needs to prove itself more as a store of value before they will be willing to do this. 
When they are wanting to hold it, not only can they offer discounts compared to credit cards because of the reduction in fees, but they can also offer additional discounts for bitcoin payments simply because they are so eager to possess more of it, as they expect it's value to rise. 
This is why bitcoin's price is more than just the price. Bitcoin's price reflects it's ability to hold value.  When there is no doubt that bitcoin will hold value, companies will be open to holding it.

Spending bitcoin is selling bitcoin. You are just selling for goods instead of fiat. Chances are the company you pay your btc too turns around and sells it for fiat. This does nothing for the price.
I get what you are saying though. You think that bitcoins value is as a transaction network. I am of the digital gold camp. Gold is not spent. 
There are so so so few applications where spending bitcoin makes sense in terms of saving cost or effort. Generally they are short lived promotions if there are any. Perhaps one day companies start boycotting the 2.5% credit card fees and start passing those savings on to their customers that use bitcoin. Until that day, spending them for goods or services is simply a novelty exercise.

First off, it'd be nice to have some proof. Next time someone sees a post they suspect might get removed from here by a mod, archive it. 
Second, calm your tits dude. Have some tact and poise. You are the same guy who made a 20 minute rant video on OKCoin only to completely forgive them like 2 days later when you realized the whole mess up was because you have them a fake ID number and didn't write it down. You'd think you would learn your lesson. Calm down and don't jump to conclusions.
Third, what part of Segwit + hard fork to 2mb is a compromise from the big blockers? Taking on Segwit? Not making blocksize completely unlimited? Honest question. 
Fourth, "They think core will leave blocksize at 1mb forever" is a terrible reason to block Segwit progress. That's just playing politics. How you can be a bitcoin supporter and get behind the idea of blocking progress for the sake of playing politics is ridic. If you oppose Segwit for other reasons, that's fine, but block bitcoin progress just because you don't like who the core developers are as people is ridiculous.
Fifth, Seeking 95% consensus on a change that is not very controversial is far from "dictator" or "monopoly" or "hijacking the protocol" or whatever you want to call it. It's the opposite. They put a lot of work into a product they stand strongly behind but STILL realize that community consensus is a must. As opposed to what the big blockers want to do which is hard fork and just make everyone pick a side. Hard forking is a form of allowing the community to vote, but it is a highly risky one. Soft forks are not perfect either but "if we get 51% fuck you guys we are forking!" Seems a lot worse to me than "hey guys we worked on this for a long time and if 95% of the community can agree, we'd like to implement this."

I never said it's usefulness was the price. Never came close to saying that.
Mike Hearn, like many, wrongly believe bitcoin's value is dependent on being a 100% on chain visa like network and somehow the visa tokens are supposed to get their value simply from being bought and sold, despite bitcoin offering no advantage for merchants or customers for 99% of transactions. There is no problem to be solved with the purchasing of coffee for example.

You guys have already admitted that the largest hodlers of bfx tokens are yourselves. You are likely the largest holders of RRT tokens as well.
You guys lost about 120k bitcoins. You marked this down in your balance book as a $72m debt owed to customers. You gave them Bitfinex debt tokens as compensation. Recovering 120k bitcoins today, minus 5% bounty, would be worth $104m. 
Let's just assume you guys aren't the largest holders of RRT tokens. Guess who would be know if RRT tokens would be redeemable before anyone else? You guys. Guess who would buy up RRT tokens in preparation?
And don't even try to tell me you guys aren't the largest holders of either BFX tokens (Zane admitted you are a few months ago) or RRT tokens. Due to anonymous nature of your exchange, you wouldn't even know who owned the majority of them.

I highly encourage people to head to and witness attempts at defending his blatantly incorrect statement that the only successful stores of value throughout the history of time have been used as a medium of exchange first. 
Not only is it a hilarious chicken and egg conundrum, as no one would use anything without value as a medium of exchange, but people have listed example after example proving his statement false. A lot of these people being faithful Ver worshippers. 
I just want you to truely take in how hard he will defend one stupid statement he made to the bitter end.

You've re shaped the whole statement to be "Money needs to be a medium of exchange" which is a complete no brained statement. It's one of the defining characteristics of money.
Still, you make some extremely obvious statement does not make his statement any more correct.
His whole goal with this statement was to claim bitcoin will fail as a store of value, not that it will fail as money. He specifically chose "store of value" to try to scare holders cause then his statement implies their coins will lose value. It's called FUD and it's what he does best.

Right. I mean obviously you are from that camp. I’m surprised you haven’t just traded your bitcoin for bitcoin cash by now. I’m surprised you didn’t sell when blocks became full in the first place, or when the blocksize didn’t increase like you wanted or whatever.
But no you can’t tell me when my reasoning came along. I bought in when I heard 21m supply cap. I bought more when I saw I was able to get around government and banking restrictions on my credit card transactions by using bitcoin. These things haven’t changed and I’ve been buying more ever since.
“Cheap and fast” was never a problem for me. Perfectly fine with using fiat money and the centralized database that is the Starbucks app to buy my coffee. It makes sense.

So they are a farce as the fastest and easiest way to buy and sell bitcoin because you are trying to use them to do neither buying nor selling of bitcoin and are having trouble with using them as a western union like service?
To be perfectly frank it sounds like you have not the slightest clue what you are doing with bitcoin or localbitcoins. I really don't know where your confusion starts and ends but let me clarify a few things:
To send $2000 of bitcoin to your mom, she simply has to have a wallet and address to receive them with. 
Localbitcoins is for buying and selling bitcoin. It's not for transferring bitcoin. Localbitcoins is not a western union like service. 
Your account got banned. We don't know why it got banned. If their reason for banning your account is legitimate, they may or may not be completely justified in their demands for proof of identity.

Actually not a bad read for a good summary of the main talking points of big blockers.
My summary of the debates is that big blockers believe that the value of bitcoin is in it's transactional capacity while small blockers believe it's value is as a decentralized store of value. Digital cash versus digital gold basically. 
You often see the big blockers point to Satoshi quotes to support the "digital cash" perspective while small blockers point to actual use cases and market valuation as evidence that, regardless of Satoshi's initial goals, the market has treated bitcoin much more as digital gold for the time being. 
The number of effective, practical use cases that treat bitcoin as a digital cash (changetip, fold Starbucks card, pizza, openbazaar, etc. along those lines of cash for goods/services kind of businesses) are very very few and they rarely maintain any substantial volume. Big blockers will claim "well the fees are too high and blocks are too big! Of course those applications aren't working!", which is a fair argument until you realize that the peak of adoption of such digital cash services was in 2014 and 2015 when blocks were not full and fees were as low as ever. Still, 90%+ of those businesses gave up on bitcoin when they simply realize bitcoin solved no problems in those applications. Using bitcoins for such services proved to be more difficult, more expensive, and more problematic. 
Now I would be lying if I said that I didn't dream of paying for my Starbucks with bitcoin back when I discovered bitcoin. Surely there is value in something that can outperform visa/Apple Pay and other similar services in that application. Surely with credit cards charging 2.5% fees or so per transaction, merchants can save on transactions by using bitcoin, pass part of those savings on to customers, and then both the customer and merchants are seeing direct benefits from using their bitcoins as digital cash.
However, when even the most diehard bitcoin fanatic purchases a pizza or tshirt online with bitcoin, they realize two things: first of all, it didn't save them money or time. Second, after spending the bitcoins they immediately wanted to buy more bitcoins to replenish their holdings. At that point, I think it becomes painfully obvious that the exercise they just carried out of using bitcoin as digital cash was extremely impractical. They don't really want to spend their bitcoins for one, and for two it's not easier or cheaper. The pizza tastes just about the same when you use your credit card. The tshirt fits about the same. 
Now let me be clear that I still hope bitcoin evolves to one day be more practical for such digital cash applications, and I believe that we are working towards that. However, I believe working towards that does not necessarily require an increase in blocksize.
Now since Satoshi outlined his original visions and goals of bitcoin as digital cash, the market and various business models have had a chance to make their own valuations and determine whether or not Satoshi's original vision was really what the market/businesses wanted. 
There are a couple key observations that hint that the market does not value bitcoin as digital cash or a transaction network nearly as much as it values it as a digital gold or a digital store of value. First off, we've seen many alt coins come and go which have much greater on chain transactional capacity. All that tells us is that transactional capacity alone does not lead to value. Second, we've seen demand for bitcoin continue to grow over the years despite on chain transactional capacity not increasing at all (see localbitcoins global volume and see bitcoin market price). All that tells us is that the markets valuation of bitcoin is not directly related to it's on chain transactional capacity.
So I guess my message to big blockers is this: Keep Satoshi's vision in mind. Value it. Develop for it. Build businesses around it. At the same time, keep in mind what gives bitcoin it's value today. Keep in mind that digital cash applications were largely impractical and unsuccessful way before the blocks got full. Realize that ensuring bitcoin maintains it's ability to function as a store of value is a key part of getting people to use it as digital cash. Consider the potential effects of a contentious hard fork on bitcoins ability to function as a store of value. Consider what applications that treat bitcoin as digital cash truly benefit from or rely on on-chain transactions.
TL DR; keep satoshi's vision of bitcoin as a digital cash in mind as a long term goal of bitcoin. At the same time, listen to the market on what it values most about bitcoins and look at the historical effectiveness of business models utilizing bitcoin as digital cash. Realize that perhaps the best path forward to reaching the stage of bitcoin serving as digital cash involves second layer solutions and maintaining bitcoin's ability to function as a store of value above all costs.
Edit: soooo many "it's" errors I'm not even gonna bother correcting them.

Your analysis is sound if you believe that Bitcoin's primary function is processing transactions. Of course, I don't see why anyone who felt that was the case would have ever invested in Bitcoin in the first place. Did you really think the cheapest and fastest way to send money would ultimately be broadcasting those transactions around the entire world? You think that's going to keep up with centralized databases in terms of speed and cost?
Who did you think the target market was? People who need to send money between each other? And you expect them to adopt a new currency to do that, even though there are a billion easier ways to send money? 
Bitcoin is a store of value, digital gold, and it cannot be duplicated. You can't grassroots this shit with an anonymous creator two times. It's a once in a lifetime kind of thing, I don't care how many times the repo is cloned to start some altcoin.
People look at the charts with your value system and it always perplexes them. Blocks were full at $1k, they stayed full to $20k. STILL, they can't look at that data and say "oh hey maybe cheap and fast isn't the key application driving the value of this commodity!"

If the rich hoard it, the poor who hold some will benefit also. If the poor can't afford to save up bitcoin, then they can't afford to save up any other inflationary currency either.
On a bit of a tangent: People hate on the deflationary aspect all of the time claiming that people would just hold it and not use it, like that's a bad thing. The western world is so used to everyone buying so much shit they don't need, that people think the world will fall apart if people choose to save instead of consume.

It's useful bordering essential for certain applications, and it will be plenty useful for all applications once people don't have to go through exchanges and pay high fees just to acquire/sell it. We need a few more years (at least), at a minimum, of proving bitcoin as a store of value, and then merchants will be more willing to hold the btc they receive for payment and pay their employees in btc, which will cut out the exchange part.

I just remember that when there was all the "China is banning bitcoin" news these last couple weeks, it was extremely hard to find a legible english translation of any of the latest news about it. 
If anyone could properly translate that medium post to chinese and get it out to the chinese miners on twitter, it would be a great service to this community. 
When's the last time you saw a chinese miner on reddit?
The number one way this attack can be put to a stop well ahead of time would be to show one or more chinese miners with significant hashrate this argument in well translated chinese. 
Our means of communicating with chinese miners are very poor.

The simplest form of a second layer solution to small merchant payments with bitcoin. Wanna spend your bitcoins with no transaction fees at any merchant Bitflyer bitcoin payments are accepted at? Load up your Bitflyer balance and then spend it. Voila. 
"Merchants stopped accepting bitcoin as a payment because customers were having to pay so much to spend it."
Just reading that quote should make your head hurt, and it's 90% of the big block propaganda. As if companies decided whether to accept a form of payment or not based on the fees their customers have to pay to use it. Something that literally has no effect on their cost of accepting bitcoin as a payment option.
The problem is, people like and 99% of live in a fantasy land where merchants accept bitcoin payments by having their own bitcoin wallets that they accept payments to and manage personally. That is simply wrong. You know why it's wrong? Because no businesses want to take on the risk of trading their services or goods for a highly volatile asset AND managing the own security of hodling that asset. So what do they do? They let companies like Bitpay, Bitflyer etc. handle all of that for them, and when they receive a "bitcoin payment", it's really just Bitpay/Bitflyer accepting the bitcoin and giving the company cash. 
Do they go out and beg Bitpay/Coinbase/Bitflyer to help them accept Bitcoin as a payment option? Of course not. Anyone who wants to buy their goods or services from them could already do so with cash or credit or debit or paypal or venmo or whatever the hell else. "Guys I really think we could increase our sales by working hard to accept a currency that 0.1% of the population even knows what it is and that 0.00000001% of the population wants to spend instead of spending fiat." - Said no company ever. What really happens is that Bitflyer and Bitpay and Coinbase go around to all these companies and beg them to let them process bitcoin payments for them. The companies are like "ok, sure, I guess. Just give us our fiat, that's all we really want."
To recap: an extremely small percentage of bitcoiners, let alone persons, wants to spend bitcoin on legal good and services when there are a ton of better payment options available that don't require them to spend their deflationary store of value. An extremely small percentage of merchants give a shit about accepting bitcoin. It does nothing to make their business more profitable. Lastly, even in the instances where companies like Bitpay and Bitflyer talk merchants into letting them accept bitcoin payments for them, the on-chain fees are a non factor to the merchant.

The "big" companies like bitpay and coinbase don't process jack shit in terms of merchant retail transactions because using bitcoin to purchase legal goods is generally a really dumb thing to do.

@_date: 2016-10-14 19:19:55
Why can't it be both?
 
No one will be forced to use LN or sidechains. Nothing about what core is doing will stop you from being able to send an on chain transaction the same exact way you do now.
 
Off chain transactions are already at least an order of magnitude more frequent than on chain transactions. Examples including transactions from one users account on a service/exchange to another users account on that service/exchange. There is no need to create an on chain copy of every transaction like that. However, the block chain is ultimately used as a settlement layer for these transactions.

Prioritizing merchant adoption right now is silly. Cart before the horse kind of thing. 
If blocks were never full and miner fees were always zero, making a retail purchase with bitcoin would still be a more expensive and less efficient way to make a retail purchase than using a credit card. That's just fact.
Prioritizing merchant adoption for bitcoin right now is like if McDonald's biggest concern was how healthy their food was. People don't go to McDonald's for healthy food. People don't buy bitcoin to use it for retail purchases.

@_date: 2018-04-11 16:16:28


Well I'll start by saying it doesn't go up because people love trading it away for goods. Maybe in the future, but we aren't there yet.
The price goes up because more and more people prefer to store their value in Bitcoin as opposed to fiat or other investment vehicles. You gonna hold Bitcoin, capped at 21m supply, or are you gonna hold the ever inflating fiat?


To store their value and protect their wealth in a post 2008 crisis world. People are waking up to how central banking has been robbing them of their wealth for decades.
Also because it is pseudo anonymous and permission-less. The best applications for Bitcoin purchases and transactions are ones in which fiat does not work. Darkweb, internet gambling, moving value from one website or exchange to another, etc..
It's not because "cheap and fast!", that's for damn sure. It's not cheaper. It's not faster. It certainly could be one day though! 
The world had no shortage of cheap and fast payment mechanisms back before Bitcoin was invented. If you think Satoshi created Bitcoin to compete with 2% merchant-side credit card fees.... well you missed what makes bitcoin revolutionary my friend.
Want proof that Bitcoin's value has almost no relation to the number of merchants accepting it and the number of people using it to buy legal goods and services? Well merchant adoption and legal goods purchasing with bitcoin peaked in 2014-2015. What more proof do you need?
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:06:25
Irrelevant. Ifyou replenish X amount of crypto after spending X amount of crypto, you spent 2% of X to use Bitcoin for those purchases instead of fiat.
In fact, 2% guaranteed in fees will be the least of your worries if you do it the way you just described. Volatility will be much more of a concern. Imagine if you had done this through all of 2017. You would have lost a shit ton of value just because the price kept going up before you rebought. You would have regretted every purchase you made with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:33:08
Then when they are passing the bitcoin savings onto customers, we can compare the two. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:32:27
Would anyone have accepted it if it didn't have value?
It's a chicken and egg problem. However it's a solvable chicken and egg problem depending on the currency.
For fiat money, there is no value outside of people accepting it, most importantly, the government accepting it and letting taxes be paid in it. 
For gold, the value came from the scarcity, which led people to accept it as a medium of exchange. 
For bitcoin, we are at $7000/BTC and less than 1% of transactions are people using it to buy legal goods. So you tell me.... is the value derived from that 1% use case?
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:44:47

The 50% BU hashrate is saying "Hey core, release a 2MB or bigger block size version of your client." It's not saying they will actually use buggy BU.
@_date: 2017-05-18 18:23:12
Exactly, it's taking them too long to validate the first block. and other core developers acknowledge this as a clear demonstration that blocks are already too big. Miners can't even validate them in time to not have to process an empty block next.
So that mechanism incentives miners to set fee limits and not mine all free transactions that they possibly can. 
I agree that the demand for paid transactions would fill up 2MB blocks very quickly. where I don't agree is that blocks will always be full regardless of block size. 


Well they want those fees of course.


Exactly. People weren't spamming the network with cheap spammy transactions until it was an effective exercise. They might ocntinue spamming at 2MB blocks, but obvs at 100MB blocks, they would have no incentive to do this, and miners would have no incentive to process their spam transactions.

This is the design of bitcoin playing itself out, whether we like it or not. No one, including Satoshi, predicted that a monopoly over ASIC manufacturing as being what would be the major flaw in Bitcoin's design. 
Tons of people are "saying it like it is" and have been saying so for over a year now. That doesn't do a damn thing. 
There are these sorts of options: UASF, PoW change, make ASICboost not work anymore, etc... All of them essentially change the original design of bitcoin.
If we don't want to change the design of bitcoin, then the only way this is getting resolved is if the market speaks out to Jihan to get it resolved. Right now the market is telling him that everything is ok.

Mining is absurdly centralized due to his monopoly over producing mining ASICs. It's the biggest problem with bitcoin currently. Scaling delay is one side effect of that much larger problem.
I see lots of post like yours proposing we solve the side effect one way or another. What I don't see is anyone trying to solve the monopoly he has that has led to mining being absurdly centralized.

As an active bitcoin and sportsbooks user, it is really cool to see them not only accepting it, but promoting it. 
I must say though, offering 3 $1000 prizes among who knows how many depositors, is not really that amazing of an offer. 
About 5 weeks ago they were matching 50% on your deposit if you used bitcoin. Now that's a promotion! I was sad to see that one end. 
Back when they did the 50% promotion, I wondered "is this because they really want to use mostly bitcoin, or is this because no one is using it, and they are making a last attempt to see if it's worth keeping the bitcoin option around. Well seeing as they went from epic promotion to meh promotion, I'm inclined to think they are really noticing how much money bitcoin saves then.

This is exactly the same as Bitflyer's campaign in Japan where they supposedly also have "mainstream adoption." What is really happening in both countries is that an exchange is putting funds towards marketing, nothing more. Every bitcoin flyer you see in japan will have Bitflyer on it somewhere. Every bitcoin you see in India will have Unocoin on it somewhere. 
"Aren't the merchants and customers going to be frustrated with transaction times and fees?"
Not necessarily. Again, these are advertisements for exchanges, not for bitcoin. If people buy their bitcoins form Bitflyer/Unocoin and then hold their bitcoins on the exchange (most likely thing they'll do), then they can spend them at a merchant who is also set up with that exchange, and the whole transaction can take place instantly off chain.

Man that sub is toxic. Clicked on all of those threads hoping I could scroll down and find counter arguments, but nope. And we are the echo chamber?! We have counter views expressed on basically everything.
ETH is volatile right now. Traders like volatility. That is why traders are dabbling in ETH. That is why exchanges are adding it. Why in the world wouldn't they add the coin that is getting all the trade volume? 
Yet.. Here bitcoin sits, quiet in the corner, at a remarkably stable price of $455. First volatility was going to be the end of bitcoin, now it's stability... Ok...
Some of my favorite copy and pasta arguments they make over there: 
"Miner's are really gonna struggle after the halving, they are already struggling at this price level!" Yeah? How about that whole fucking year spent at around $230 where the hashrate just kept on growing? The price is double now. Do I really need to do that math for you to show that current price could easily sustain them through a reward drop? 
"It's in everyone's best interest to switch away from Core!" Yeah? Then why the fuck is no one doing it? Why the fuck did nobody even give classic a try?!
"By holdig bitcoins you are supporting core. I'll buy mine back when Core is not leading anymore." Yeah you will buy them back. You'll be buying them back with all of your ETH, at a price much higher then the current price. Where you are wrong is that Core won't be in charge.
"Too late to save bitcoin now" LOLOLOLOL. Have these guys not checked the fucking price? 
What's most hilarious is all these Mike Hearn, "abandon ship!" types have left the market, and yet here we are at a stable $455.... Hmmm what happens when they start racing each other to get back in...

Jihan has no interest in EC or an EC altcoin. He is interested in extending his ability to use ASICboost for as long as possible.
ASICboost is more profittable to Jihan than $10,000 bitcoins would be.
@_date: 2017-05-18 17:44:24


Yes it does. It takes longer to validate a block. This is why miners often mine empty blocks for the sake of reducing validation time to ensure they get the block reward.
The easiest way to disprove what you are saying though is to look at blocks anytime before they were all full. The cap has been 1MB for a few years. Not all blocks mined were 1MB....
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:15:00
$10k coins isn't any more profitable than $1k coins. If we had $10k coins, more miners would come on board and maintaining share of the network hashrate would become proportionally more expensive as the price moved up.
Mining is a zero sum game. Those making profit in the long run will be those with the most advantages such as cheap electricity, cheap ASICs, and stuff like ASICboost. Guess which miner has the most of these advantages?
@_date: 2017-05-10 16:17:47
I don't think anyone is doing anything to try to hurt bitcoin.
I simply thin Ver and Jihan are trying to profit in various ways, which is human nature. Ver is primarily profitting from altcoins. His pumping of them with the scaling debate is well documented. Jihan wants to keep using ASICboost which nearly doubles his profits. Both also may be trying to keep the price lower so they can accumulate more.

Nothing simple about that at all. I'm all for Core's roadmap and against miners (mainly Jihan) taking over full control of what software is used, but even I would 100% consider a new PoW coin to be an altcoin. Most exchanges would too. Best case scenario with a PoW change is that we get Bitcoin2 or some spin off, and it just so happens to out perform Bitcoin.

Exactly. As long as they only see you buying bitcoins, they can always chalk it up to investing. When you are cashing out more than you buy from them, they have to wonder where those bitcoins came from. 
furthermore, when you deposit, these books give you a unique address to deposit at, then they move them from that address to their wallet. Coinbase doesn't know at which point the coins were no longer yours. On the other hand, if you send bitcoins from a bookie to coinbase, it is extremely easy to track it going directly from the bookie to coinbase.

Even if the PBoC is funding Jihan or whatever narrative you are hinting at... the first step is everyone realizing that scaling is not the problem.

@_date: 2017-05-31 15:31:03
I simply hope that when Jihan shuts down this or any other increased blocksize compromise, that people will finally realize it's all about asicboost. The dude is running a business, plain and simple. He gives zero shits about Bitcoin the protocol. Asicboost saves him about ~40% on operating costs which likely increase his profits by a much greater percentage than that.

TL;DR: Miners have zero incentive to see the price of bitcoin rise, because as revenues increase proportionally to the price, their costs to stay competitive and maintain market share also increase. They have incentive to not let it fall to a level that puts their revenue below their costs though, otherwise they start to go out of business. 
The narrative of "higher bitcoin price is more profits for miners" is largely false. 
Let's say a mining operation has 15% of the network hashrate. They receive approximately 15% of all newly mined bitcoins. When the prices rises, those bitcoins are worth more, so revenue and profits increase, right? 
Wrong. Revenue increases, profit does not. This is because as the price of bitcoin rises, the cost to maintain 15% of the network hashrate increases, because more and more miners are coming online, their hardware is going obsolete and they have to increase costs to stay competitive.
Andreas Antonopolous said it himself: Mining is a zero sum game. You only profit if you have unique advantages over the competition. Cheaper power, asics, etc... These advantages lower your costs and your profit margin is greater than your competition. I've seen estimates that ASICboost reduces costs by about 40% FWIW. So there is your answer why Jihan doesn't want to make ASICboost not work anymore.
Dips in price do however directly impact miner profits. They can't suddenly reduce their costs proportionately when the price nosedives. So they have incentive to not let the price crash, but they have no incentive to see it rise any further.
Miners have the goal of obtaining as large of a percentage of the network hashrate as possible. They do this by surviving the dips better than their competitors. If the price crashed to $500 overnight, guess which miner is least likely to have to shut down operations? Jihan. He has asicboost, the cheapest access to hardware, and as good of access to cheap electricity as any of his competitors.
I would even go as far to say that Jihan wouldn't mind the price crashing. I estimate that he represents nearly 50% of network hashrate at the moment. If he could survive another bear market, he could come out accounting for 75%.
Then of course there is the more obvious: More fees = more miner revenue. Why exactly would they want to reduce their revenue by reducing fees?
Roger Ver? Well his altcoin investments have performed phenomenally as a result of him propagating the narrative that bitcoin's value derives solely from cheap and fast transactions and that other cryptos are going to take over.

Difficulty is only relevant when talking about how many miners can be supported. It basically shows how many miners are competing with each other to mine the next block. Regardless of difficulty, the same number of coins are produced every day. So during that $230 period, more and more miners came on board. This indicates that not only was it profitable, but they were expanding operations and new miners were coming on board. Also technology was improving.

Nobody believes this BS. Jihan doesn't believe this BS. 
Jihan has a monopoly on ASIC production, is behind more network hashrate than any other company, miners are pulling in more revenue than ever in the history of bitcoin due to bitcoin's price and the high fees, and he is improving his profits by something like 40% with ASICboost.
This guy doesn't want change. Life is fucking great for him as is. All he is doing is stalling scaling while he adds more and more hashrate and sells more and more asics. He already accounts for nearly 50% of the network hashrate. If he can get to 75% or so, he essentially owns bitcoin.

The ONLY purpose behind FUDing before we even get the SegWit part is basically to discourage people from using the client, and I don't see what the point of that is, other than to make sure people are using your client, or a client you support, which comes off as a desperate attempt to control others.

Including your transactions in the blockchain is an attack now... lol I can't even.... guess I've been "attacked" a ton then

Luckily we get our side of the agreement first, and there is no way whatsoever that the 2MB part can be enforced just because we get the SegWit part. In fact, it will be even harder to force after activation of SW.
The SW part is in consensus with BIP148 (if done soon enough) and Core's latest client.
Like I said, we can have the 2MB debate after this. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:16:14
Well it's a step in the right direction. I agree it's still a humongous overreach and breach of freedom and privacy. However, the article doesn't say "Coinbase agrees to hand over all records with less than $20k in transactions"

Doesn't matter if he is a pool or completely independent miner. 
The price goes up, more hashrate joins the party because of it, the difficulty goes up, and the miner who was there before the price spike isn't any more profitable than they were before, because now they have less of the hashrate.
@_date: 2017-07-07 19:35:25
Well there are two parts. First part is the segwit part, which Core clients, UASF clients, and SegWit2x clients will all be signalling for and won't have any contention. If/When SegWit gets activated, then clients decide on the 2MB part of the proposal next.

This sub and bitcoin.org today:
Step 1. Create bitcoin.org FUD piece. Don't specify the nature of the fork you are alerting the public about or anything of course (it's core's very own UASF bullshit btw). Instead, just spread general FUD about how the network won't work or some bullshit.
Step 2. Criticize coinbase for not making it clear if they "support" the fork or not. As if coinbase has time to even acknowledge the creation of an altcoin from 0.3%  of the hashrate and less than 2% of nodes.
Step 3. When coinbase does give a forced response, misquote the living fuck out of them so that you can spread more FUD.
Bravo on a really awesome day And on a day where our subreddit is on the front page. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 02:01:30
The bullshit FUD around here today is making me fucking sick to my stomach. Just when I thought the R/BTC side of things couldn't make themselves look any worse than hiring CSW to spread their propaganda, this sub here turns full retard, almost like they have to out do them. 
The bitcoin.org FUD piece today was a complete joke. Not only do they not even specify the nature of the joke threat they are worried about (BIP148 developed by their very own luke-jr), but they have the audacity to claim a fork with 0.3% hashrate and minimal node support support is going to have ANY affect on the rest of the market. 
Then, in that very same fucking day, this sub goes and attack coinbase for "not making it clear if they support" the joke non event that is UASF. UASF doesn't deserve to be acknowledged or even discussed, let alone "supported".
Not full retard enough for ya yet? It gets better. Now there is this fucking post where they straight up fucking lie about what coinbase's response was in order to spread more FUD. Then they have the fucking audacity to blame it on Jihan. 
What a complete fucking joke. Pathetic.

1) A deflationary currency combined with a saving society instead of an inflationary currency combined with a spending society.
2) Inflation doesn't tax the rich more than it does the poor. It's a percentage tax. We all lose about 2% of the wealth we hold in dollars every year. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 15:39:12
So basically 91% or so of the hashrate would just stop making new blocks until a &gt;1MB block came along? The other 9% or so of the hashrate would just keep mining blocks at the normal pace though, no? It could take that 9% much greater than 30 minutes anyways, of course.
So that would basically be the fork, when the majority of hashrate pauses to wait for a &gt;1MB block?
@_date: 2017-07-19 14:27:58
Both sides of the debate are gonna have a lot more evidence for or against their positions after this gets done though, and that's the best part. Maybe effective 8mb blocks cause 75% of nodes to drop off the network. Maybe LN never comes or is never used. Maybe the softfork goes like shit. Maybe the hardfork goes like shit. Maybe we get a split and it doesn't end up as bad as everyone fears. 
@_date: 2017-07-07 15:46:11
Exchanges aren't doing a damn thing because this is all manufactured drama to keep the price low while whales and miners accumulate bitcoins. 
UASF is a bluff, but I will call it a success if we get Segwit by August 1st, even if via some stupid NYA.
The JihanCoin hardfork is an even bigger joke. The dude is gonna mine coins that literally no exchanges are accepting and that no one is buying? 
Exchanges doing nothing is THE indicator that both of these forks have zero actual chance of happening.

His revenue is higher than ever due to high BTC price and high fees:
Stalling scaling is a pretty profitable move for him, clearly. Especially if he is taking advantage of being able to hold the price lower to accumulate bitcoins and then sell them at a higher price once he lets scaling happen.

To me, this is the biggest flaw in Bitcoin's design that I am aware of, and I've often considered leaving bitcoin behind for this very reason. The holders and the people running the network don't share the same incentives.
Mining is a zero sum game. Profitability in mining boils down to how many advantages you have over the rest of the market. Things like cheaper electricity, cheaper/better ASICs, etc.

The 150% is ROI. On what timeframe is he calculating that? Dunno. The idea though is that he invests less when price is down because he can maintain hashrate share easier during those periods. When price is up he invests more to remain competitive, and his returns are greater. Profit same in both.
Well with Bitcoin Cash or whatever you wanna call that nonsense, they are readjusting the difficulty before others will even be able to mine it. So with them having like 10% of hashrate or whatever, John would need Bitcoin Cash tokens to be worth 1/10 the price of bitcoin for profitability to be the same. 
Not sure why we are talking about that altcoin though.

I assume you are referring to the ETH DAO fork?
The "funds" they lost and got reimbursed for were the minority chain tokens of ETC. Anyone who wants to not only keep their cryptos on an exchange during a fork, but also wants to then try to send them out way before shit settles down, were very lucky to get a reimbursement at all.
The reality is that you and the rest of the Core shill team today want to spread FUD about this fork and are more concerned about ensuring the minority chain survives than helping to have a successful hardfork.

I agree that this was made into a bigger deal than it really was.


This just seems like wishful thinking and planning for the best instead of planning for the worst. First off, there is the obvious argument that no one will want to be making bitcoin transactions right around when the hardfork occurs. The safe instructions to all the HODLERs is gonna be "keep that shit offline and don't make transactions until it's over." You are essentially hoping that the network does not come to a crawl (relatively) during this fork, and I don't think that's a safe assumption. 
Even if there is a 99.99% chance that a block is quickly created to be greater than 1MB, we should be planning for that 0.01% chance still, no?

How are new US dollars created? 
How many are in existence today? 
How many will be created over the next year, decade, or 50 years? 
Who invented the dollar?
How does a digital transaction of a dollar work?
And so on. It's an eye opening moment for a few, and a reminder to others to just leep not caring. It's only money after all; the concept that keeps our capitalist world turning.

Cost averaging over time is generally a smart way to buy in.
The one thing I would advise is to make more purchases more freqeuently, without exceeding the monthly amount you had in mind. Randomly buying at a given date every month really opens you up more to getting hurt by variance. You could buy the high point (or low point) every month with good or bad luck. You could miss a huge dump or huge pump.
Let's say your plan is 1 btc every month. I'd advise buying .25 btc every week or a 30th if a bitcoin every day. You can easily set this up on coinbase to be done automatically btw.

Sweet chain split proposal guys. I love how you all bought into the "Bitcoin can't scale so it's doomed forever!!!" bullshit narrative and are now self destructing as a result. You got played.

I've relentlessly called this dude out on his true motivations for his daily bearish bitcoin posts in The clown finally stopped posting there a couple months ago.
Hadn't read anything from him in a while but I just had to click that link. My head hurts so much. So so much. His last few comments are legit the dumbest shit I've read.

Can miners basically signal that they want to upgrade and are paying attention but don't see anything they like?

No chance Jihan runs BIP148 obviously. It blocks ASICboost.
@_date: 2017-06-22 18:30:01
But... my gains :(
@_date: 2017-07-14 20:25:48
Dip in price is a result of a month of uncertainty ahead, altcoin bubble bursting, and profit taking.
How would AlphaBay going offline have an effect on the price? You think a lot of people had hoards of bitcoins offline they were gonna buy drugs with, but now that alphabay is offline they are gonna sell them?
@_date: 2017-06-08 19:29:15
And it sounds more and more likely he is already invested in ETH instead.

Still have to load the bitcoin into the channel, which would require same fee, but if I'm buying Burger King on a regular basis, maybe I load up my balance in the Burger King channel and reduce total fees that way.
But nah, BK is gonna use an exchange to settle their payments. They don't want to hold bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 16:39:18


But you think your contentious soft fork of bitcoin will go any better? Forget the big blockers and Core bashers, I'd argue around 50% of SegWit supporters don't support BIP148, including me. Setting a hard date to do a contentious fork, regardless of consensus, is hilarious stupid. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:41:59
But, but, they released open source code and patiently await 95% consensus on running it! The monsters!

If we are mining it in space at all, with great infrastructure in place or not, then clearly it will be very valuable. 
I agree that gold is overvalued, but the idea that we are gonna go mine something in space and thereby decrease it's value is absurd. I don't think we will try to mine gold from space at all. There are more valuable metals to mine in space.

No. No it's not.

Lol there is very good reason UASF only has 1% support. "Let's fork on a certain date, regardless of consensus level!" Genius!
@_date: 2017-06-08 15:45:13
I find it funny that so many people try to differentiate "cash" from a "settlement layer" when cash is THE settlement layer of fiat.
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:44:42
Matcalfes law states that the value of a network is proportional to the number of users squared. So if half the users use one side of the split and half use the other, then the value of both networks together would equal half the value of the network before the split.
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:11:57
Even without affecting immutability, I will consider a chain split that leaves us with anything comparable to Bitcoin Classic Vs Bitcoin just like we have ETC vs ETH a failure. 
Exchanges could be trading more and more of these tokens against each other already, and make money off the trading fees, but they don't want to do that because they realize how bad that looks for bitcoin.
The day you advise a friend to buy bitcoin and they have to ask "which one?".... yeah, that would be a huge failure.
@_date: 2017-06-05 17:48:37
Rising fees or never ending inflation. Take your pick.
@_date: 2017-07-12 15:09:38
Well, if that's part of the plan then I guess that's a good thing for the fork to go successfully. 
I'm tired of arguing which scaling solution is right. 91% of the mining hashrate is in agreement and you can either follow along with what that hashrate is doing or your only other option is the create a new PoW altcoin forked from bitcoin. I'm only interested in seeing it go smoothly at this point. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 21:18:00
I'm saying that UASF is DOA. There is a month and a half left and you expect it to actually work with relatively zero actual support on any metrics that matters?
@_date: 2017-06-01 06:08:03
Right, and only reason you discourage a run on the bank is that you are insolvent or lying about funds.

@_date: 2017-06-13 18:00:49
After UASF comes and goes as a complete non-event? I mean, sure, but why wait that long?
@_date: 2016-07-20 16:40:21
It's like 6 hours since hard fork? Maybe give it a couple days before ruling it as a complete success. Maybe see what happens when the duped investors get their coins back?
@_date: 2017-06-28 23:26:42
Confirmation times and transaction fees are both completely irrelevant. If I'm a customer, I cover the transaction fee when I send the payment to the exchange. The exchange gives the fiat money to the merchant without having to wait for confirmations. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:48:56


These are good things they did? Where is the one decent client that came out of all of this? Don't point me to classic or BU please... they are both a joke.
Lay off the caps lock pal. Buy some ETH if you are so worried. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 16:24:25
Your "better option" is clearly only going to result in an early deployment of the joke NYA proposal known as SegWit2x. There is still zero hashrate behind BIP148, so if we just let the UASF jokesters do their thing, Aug 1st would be a non event. Instead, the votes that matter (hashrate) are using BIP148 to create FUD and get their SegWit2x via an overly hasty deployment.
Run your nodes with whatever rebellious software you want to run it with. Feel empowered that it will bring SegWit I guess.
When you are later asking yourself how Bitcoin's $40B network is being run on unproven code on July 31st, and why we didn't take our time in getting it done, just remember "Ohhh yeah because we came up with that joke of a proposal called UASF and then they used it against us to get their implementation in sooner."
@_date: 2017-06-13 14:17:24
Annnnnnd have all that info on one site online. No thanks. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 18:36:41
A couple months ago I was irrationally worried about BU possibly doing a much less risky fork.
Now this sub is going to do a 10x risky fork and they are gonna do it regardless of consensus level.
What UASF supporters don't realize is that they have been coerced into the lie that bitcoin scaling is an emergency, and now they are going to attack bitcoin as a result. 
This is a loss for bitcoin, not a win.
@_date: 2016-07-06 13:31:24
My favorite of his narratives has been
 "$700 will be huge resistance guys. ATH adjusted market cap according to some napkin math I did."
"Oh wow we blew past $700, clear sailinf to $1200 cause everyone really really cares about my napkin math."
"Oh hey back below $700! See guys?! It's again cause of my napkin math! I was right all along!"
Dude can't be wrong. He has also been legit making bearish and bullish predictions over last week or two. So, again, he is guaranteed to be right.
@_date: 2017-06-26 17:06:46


I don't think there is any "what if" about this. I'm certain it is happening. I'm afraid that Jihan will dictate that SegWit2x doesn't prevent ASICboost. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 19:27:34
From the anti-fragile perspective, he is only strengthening it.
@_date: 2017-06-23 16:31:09
I spend most of my days in on every price spike in either direction, you will see countless complaints about how Kraken fucked people over with their shitty trading engine, lack of ability to stay online during periods of heavy load, and slow support response times.

@_date: 2017-06-08 20:15:06
I just agreed with you on all of this. 
The only place I disagree is that Mark Cuban will be interested in both.
There is one crypto to rule them all, it's called bitcoin. ETH wasn't even comparable to bitcoin until as recently as 3 months ago. Since then, it has been pumped 2000%+ by being traded primarily with the ETH/BTC pair, and now all of the sudden it's the dual ruler of crypto? Give me a break.
@_date: 2017-06-27 16:16:04
It's in logarithmic scale...

The supply never stops increasing... definition of inflationary
@_date: 2018-12-18 18:05:12
Keep in mind the cost of the ASICs is a sunk cost at this point. They simply need to generate more money than they spend on electricity, and they'll keep them on.
@_date: 2017-06-28 19:28:19
Easier for them to just ust a centralized payment processor. LN implementation would only make sense if they actually wanted to transact in bitcoin. They will instead surely just be turning their bitcoin into fiat the second they receive it. In that case, using an exchange to process their payments makes the most sense.
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:53:42
If SegWit2x does activate in time to make BIP148 a non-event, BIP148 was massively successful. Showed Jihan what's what.
@_date: 2017-06-02 15:27:43
That's not gonna happen by August 1st
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:36:18
Of course I would. A chain split is highly undesirable and shows a failure of achieving consensus. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 16:54:34
True consensus = effectively 0% chance of chain split. 
If we get a chain split, we all lose.
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:15:45
Some chain splits can be seen as surviving. Not sacrificing immutability is a big part of that.
ETH had to roll back their blockchain. That's like the definition of not surviving. Makes their blockchain a "sometimes the blockchain is law" kind of blockchain.
@_date: 2017-06-30 01:26:59
ETH has a higher inflation rate.... so yeah.

You are comparing a theoretical scenario with something that actually happened. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 16:48:02
Now we are talking the same language. I agree that BIP-148 is demanding it, and at whatever cost. I'm more than willing to patiently await true consensus. The scaling fud was overblown and a fee market isn't that bad.
@_date: 2017-06-20 20:31:22
It *might* get "big" 2MB blocks in 6 months. We definitely get segwit first though.
It shows him what's what because he has been forced to acknowledge that a BIP148 style proposal led by users can actually dictate what "valid" chain he spends his CPU power to verify. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 19:17:37
0% chance you get the bitcoin before giving over the cash.

@_date: 2017-06-14 22:28:28


Bitcoin was specifically designed such that any such 1% hashpower chain should shrivle and die almost immediately. So yeah, if the design doesn't work, then it's a failure or at least partial failure.
@_date: 2017-06-13 17:15:50
Lots of people repeating the same 4 letters in here, yet there is less than 1% hashrate behind this movement. A tiny percentage of nodes too.
Can we perhaps move on from the empty bluff that is UASF and maybe try to work on other solutions? Maybe focus on blocking asicboost, which would destroy jihan's incentive to block Segwit?
