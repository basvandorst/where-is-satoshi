Last week someone on this sub said The Big Bang theory will air soon with an episode on Bitcoin and it will rise a LOT. At that time I laughed at him saying that a TV show will have no effect on BTC at all. 
Now I don't know if that guy was right or it's just a coincidence.

Roadster is a hard top convertible. Coupes(e.g.: 4 series coupe, c class coupe, A5 etc..) are def. not convertibles.

If money from left pocket to right pocket counts as 1 transaction, then the whole number loses its meaning. It didn't achieve anything, on contrary it wasted electricity, meaning it's a losing transaction. Because from an absolute point of view, nothing was gained by that transaction. 
If people buy goods using the currency, then it served a purpose. To bridge the trade that was done and helped 2 parties in the mean time, that's how the world runs.
But all the wash trades and fund merging, demerging are meaningless in an economic sense. Sure they benefited whoever needed those transactions to profit, but it's only 1 party inflicted transaction with no real world gain.
