It means investors need to pay attention.

I'm not kicking you when you're down. I was referring to your question about 's comment.
I had a bit in Hashie, too, so I am not blameless.  In the last month I started to move to AMHash instead of the Gen1 stuff but too late.  
I realized it was chancey and did it anyway.  I wasn't particularly convinced by the one-time mining stats because it is possible to rent a truckload of TH for the period the stat would later show.  Still I did it.

Since I have so little BTC  at stake I logged in.  Taking one for the team.  :-)   
First I tried a known-bad password and it rejected it.  Then I did my actual username/pass and was presented the 2FA as usual.  Provided 2FA and logged in.
Could see my miners as usual.  I had less than a buck of BTC sitting in there (non-free miners were on auto-rebuy).   I requested withdrawal to one of my wallets;  it said "Success.  Withdrawal request has been recorded. We will make the payment when/if we can."
Other than that the only things that look different are the "temporarily suspended" language in the side bar and "Auto-rebuy (disabled)" on the AMHash.
Makes me wonder if maybe the miners are still still running with the resulting BTC being siphoned off to the owner|hacker|whatever's wallet.
Edit:  I [transferred my AMHash to AMHash.com]( and it was visible on my account there in about a day.   The login process and some of the spelling is rough, but I hope it's stable.

That's the kind of question each of us has to answer for ourselves.

Anxious enough to work on the ARG?

I give up trying to talk to you.
