Perhaps I misspoke. I mostly wanted to convey that hash rate fixed, these rigs will require less energy to do the same amount of work. Right? It doesn’t take nearly the same amount of electricity to power an oven as it did when the appliance was first created. This applies to rigs and all electronics to be frank. Right?
To answer the mining part of you question -the article was talking about miners almost unionizing to protect their business. If I am a miner and it costs me $6000 a month to mine 24-7 then I will certainly not sell my block rewards for less than $6000. This article I read suggests a cartel-like mining community that would not put BTC into circulation for less than X price. 
My example was super simplified but the point is clear. This would be a longterm play by miners as there are still (85%•21000000) BTC in circulation, but you have to think over time as people hoard and coins are lost there will be a liquidity shortage and demand will become high enough for miners to part with their rewards. This would protect the price and miners’ bottom line. 
Disclaimer: I studied finance, so my mining rig comment could be incorrect.

I read an article a couple of months ago about an organized ‘wall’ per se by the miners. The gist is that to remain profitable the miners will not sell their block rewards below X amount thus protecting their viability as a miner. Not sure how plausible this is, but I can see after some time this liquidity blockade would effect price. 
Mining rigs are also getting more efficient and requiring less electricity to update the ledger. TX fees are small, but if the price of BTC rises then these fees will be valued more. I have to think that by 2084 or so when all coins are mined we will have rigs that will require a trivial amount of power that have exponentially higher hash rates than today. 
Lastly, BTC will never be digital cash - It’s not scaled to be that. However, there is far too much institutional money in BTC (and cryptocurrencies writ large) for it to go away. Hobbyists and miners alike will always have a price for BTC whether it’s $.10 or $10K
Thank you for coming to my tedtalk.

Good point but BTC will never go away. There is too much institutional money in BTC and scaling be stood up for it to just evaporate. To your point the future of BTC may never be $100,000- 1BTC, but there will never be a future where BTC does not exist. I believe BTC will be a digital commodity investors put their money in as a safe heaven asset similar to gold. BTC will, in my opinion, never be a digital cash because it cannot scale to the speed at which Visa/MasterCard can process payments. Which is fine by me if I never spend BTC (which I believe will go higher) on trivial shit like coffee.
