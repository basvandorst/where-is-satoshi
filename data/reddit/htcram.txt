"There are two methods of curing the mischiefs of faction: the one, by removing its causes; the other, by controlling its effects. "
Both have been accomplished as far as I can tell. 
Love the idea....

Well, I was under the impression the current blockchain is around 30-50 GB. My question was what could happen if bitcoin technologies grew significantly in popularity, wouldn't the blockchain end up being terabytes in size?  If so, after a certain point, the average desktop wouldn't be able/want to host it.

Ignore my last question, I have better one. Whomever has access to your private keys, can access your bit-monies, right? Just like the banks: you deposit and they give you a receipt (then get to do whatever).
From what I understand, coinbase is US only. Nevertheless, why would anyone want to use it?  Ease of use; exchange services; or what?
Edit: I understood competition and the idea of lost leaders, however whatever Blythe Masters touches end up being highly extractive to the average person.
Thank you in advance, I know I'm being a pain.

Clever. Thank you.

Are you saying different node hosts can prune different parts of the blockchain and still work together?

I've asked silly questions and they were answered, Thank you again.  Now I'm curious, and will (research on my own) prepare to jump down the rabbit hole.
Consider me a convert on your and this subreddit's help in this post.

Isn't she the female big-"C" that primarily helped cause the mess in 2008?

Yes, this was explained to be in the first/top response. I understand this now (not fully but I'll get there). The title of the post was prefixed with "Newbie Question:" and almost everyone was extremely helpful, however I'll thank you all the same.
Good Day. 
Edit: crap I can't help myself. If something is linear, then it should not be expressed in terms of exponents; that would be redundant, you understand..."...if its rate of change must be expressed....".

Okay, gotcha.  I thought an important part of bitcoin was the ledger. 
Let's say you used a smart contract requesting a micro-funded loan from 1mil people for 1mil amortised over 20 years with daily repayments. 
If I understand, the contract, all the micro loans and each repayment would be in various blocks along the blockchain, which let's pretent in 20 years would be petabytes in size.
I'm I right in thinking that if you didn't have a section of the blockchain that represents the entire contract and fullfilment, one would be relying on a third party when challenged?
Couldn't a third-party then say "oh, you want info on a 10 year old transaction? That'll be a $5 processing fee?".  Again, I'm very new to all this--thank you for answering my questions.

Okay! Blocks are chained using SJA256. As for exponential growth (I should have said logarithmic growth), I was referring to demand for blocks and not the supply, however I think you answered my question.
If I understand you correctly, if one wanted to prune the blockchain (say halfway), one would take the culminative SHA256 hash of the previous  blocks, prune those blocks and rebuild the rest of the chain from there?  Is this right?
I guess, one could treat entire blockchains as blocks and create a super-blockchain.
LOL, I've REALLY new to this. Thank you.

Something is said to increase or decrease exponentially if its rate of change must be expressed using exponents.
Or B^E = N, where B is Base; E is the exponent and N is the number. 
Is this kinda right, or exactly right?

Thank you. I double-checked and had watched a youtube video on the subject from 2014--guess changes are happening fast.
