Wouldn't it? Because if each node has only 1-5% of the total p2pool hashrate, the hackers would have to redirect traffic from each one of those nodes to get any significant hash power to their own pool.

No,  because you will never have 1 node controlling an entire 50% share.  Anyway,  once p2pool gets a big better and more user friendly,  running your own node will be trivial,  or at least trivialish :-P

“Silk Road was specifically and intentionally designed for the purpose of facilitating unlawful transactions,” Forrest writes in her 51-page order, embedded below. “Ulbricht is alleged to have knowingly and intentionally constructed and operated an expansive black market for selling and purchasing narcotics and malicious software and for laundering money. This separates Ulbricht’s alleged conduct from the mass of others whose websites may—without their planning or expectation—be used for unlawful purposes.” (

Another reason to use p2pool.  Btcguild.com has a preliminary warning up that it may have issues operating if this bit license thing spreads to other states. 
Shameless plug for p2pool 
Using p2pool is supporting a decentralized bitcoin.
Joining a p2pool public node is just as easy as joining a private pool. Except you can choose any node you like. And there is no loss to income. Try to find a pool node that has low latency (low ping from your location)
 has a list of nodes and the fees they charge.
Note it can take a while for your payments to start coming through and stabilizing. P2pool uses a 3 day PPLNS period so you will start getting the full amount near the 3rd day. A block is roughly found everyday so variance is not a huge issue either.

On P2Pool stales refer to shares which can’t make it into the sharechain. Because the sharechain is 60 times faster than the Bitcoin chain many stales are common and expected. However, because the payout is PPLNS only your stale rate relative to other nodes is relevant; the absolute rate is not.
There are two reported kinds of stales in P2Pool: “DEAD ON ARRIVAL” shares and orphan shares. Dead shares were too old by the time they arrived at your local P2Pool. Very high dead rates can indicate miner misconfiguration. Orphan shares are shares which were not extended by the rest of the P2Pool network, because some other miner’s share was accepted first. Very high orphan rates may indicate network connectivity problems.
The P2Pool console output shows your relative stale rate compared to other P2Pool miners in the ‘Own efficiency’ column:
2012-01-07 20:57:51.797420 Pool stales: 13% Own: 13±2% Own efficiency: 100±2%

Looks to me that he has actual facts and concerns. Real people lost money on mtgox. He is saying the warning signs were clear to The Foundation and also they we're given inside access to withdraw their coins before others. If this is the case, I fully support him exposing this "insider trading", here it is copy pasted from his blog:
1) The Foundation never once warned Bitcoin investors about keeping deposits in Mt. Gox, despite clear red flags dating back to at least April 2013.  Nor did the Foundation craft or advocate for best practices such as technical transparency, deposit audits, or appropriate consumer protection disclosures.  This was a colossal failure of leadership. 
   
2) There is evidence that Bitcoin Foundation board members may have had direct access to Mark Karpeles which allowed them to personally deposit and withdraw funds from Mt. Gox, despite persistent delays for other customers. 
3) There is a troubling and inappropriate overlap between Peter Vessenes’ staff at his private company, CoinLab, and the Bitcoin Foundation’s staff, which goes far beyond shared office space.   
4) The current leadership has shown a stunning disregard for proper communications with its members.  The importance of immediate resignations (rather than gradual) is highlighted by the Board’s secret plans to move the Foundation’s headquarters to London without input from members and sponsors.
5) Peter Vessenes has had a nine month conflict of interest regarding Mt. Gox given that his company CoinLab was involved in an active multi-million dollar lawsuit against Mark Karpeles and Mt. Gox, following a failed partnership.  Both men remained on the board of directors, and the Foundation failed to draft adequate by-laws that would allow them to address situations such as this where directors had material conflicts, which would compromise their ability to act in the best interests of its members.

I found a couple of issues with the cointerra.
1) It was extremely noisy, not ideal for running at home
2) Despite it being water cooled, it was hypersensitive to the ambient temperature.  When it started getting moderately warm in the room, the hashrate dropped drastically.
Compared to KnCMiner's units, which were drop dead silent, and managed to run at full hashrate or even overclocked in warm rooms.

Strangely... this is actually a reasonable number at the current BTC price.
See this post to understand why:

Tips won't save them now.  They are probably in big financial trouble
@_date: 2015-01-18 04:03:54

This is flipping amazing.  
@_date: 2015-01-27 03:53:02
Gotcha, thanks for the clarification 
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:57:44
randomly sending $1 to people is spam?  Well sign me up then.
@_date: 2015-01-20 16:45:43
Why do you have to download a software ?
Why can't I just donate from the site directly?
@_date: 2014-05-27 17:23:45
I just called, as of today
Just for comparison,
Cavirtex BTC/CAD : $610.00
Their price: $674 to buy, $616 to sell
If you want to call the Cafe, and ask, their number is (647) 342-9229
Note, they don't operate the machine, they simply host it, and they won't be able to answer many of the questions

Its hard to take financial advice seriously from someone whose username is 'Right_In-The-Pussy'
@_date: 2014-08-10 04:02:00
Uhh irs a public pool. That could be anyone mining on there.  Even me.. No evidence they doubled anything. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 03:47:51
What was that site again where you can pay $10 to contribute to running a new node? 
Edit: found it :-) 
@_date: 2014-03-19 16:14:09
I was just able to login fine
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:54:03

$1 excellent!
@_date: 2013-08-23 20:58:16
There's these guys.  but you have to pay the high price + a fee, or sell at the low price.  pretty much a rip off.
@_date: 2015-02-25 02:34:03
2000 bits hilarious 
@_date: 2013-11-12 20:06:17
Their fee is the fact that they sell at THE HIGH PRICE of the day.  For example right now on Cavirtex the going rate is $353.   on CanadianBitCoins, Buy Rate: $372.02
@_date: 2013-11-01 19:31:37
go to a site that sells them (mtgox.com, coinbase.com, bitstamp.com, etc) or use a localbitcoins site to find someone to trade with locally
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:28:46
What is this thing?  Run our software to make money? Seems fishy
@_date: 2013-08-23 20:30:28
xrandr, paypal did not say they were going to adopt bitcoin, but the paypal ceo DID mention that they were LOOKING INTO bitcoin (whatever that means exactly). here's the evidence
@_date: 2013-11-12 20:04:56
How do you cash out your coins in Egypt?  Is there any money exchangers there?
