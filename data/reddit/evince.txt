Well, they claim they are regularly audited: 
Audit is performed by Friedman LLP.  So now I guess the claim is Friedman LLP is performing fraudulent audits?

Blacked out names are shady?  If I bought tether I wouldn't want my name published.
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:00:33
According to their website, Tether is regularly audited:
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:50:34
Do you have evidence the tethers aren't backed by dollars?
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:05:26
That’s fine, there will eventually be bigger blocks.  If we do it now there will be no incentive for people to start using batching and segwit.  People need to upgrade their software before begging for a hardfork.
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:20:37
Meh, the amount of Tether's is so small I don't really care either way.  You seem rather certain that they're fraudulent.  I'm just saying there's no evidence either way.

Actually, 2 minutes of googling tells me Friedman LLP is responsible for their audit.  Did Friedman LLP audit your 20 tons of gold as well?
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:03:58
Maybe email them and ask who is performing the audit they reference on their website?

You're an idiot.  Signatures remain onchain with SegWit.  Dumbass.
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:22:24
Fair enough.  I don't know one way or another if they're printing tethers.  At this point it's all just conjecture.  Regardless, the amount of tethers printed is reasonably small that it's not really a concern.

OP is the one making the claim that they aren't.  I'm just asking for evidence.
I've looked at it for all of 5 minutes now.  According to tether, they are regularly audited:

Like I thought, you can't expand on that.  Bcash shill.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:31:32
Sorry, I'm referring to mining centralization here.  With any cryptocurrency, 51% attacks are always the danger.  If a single mining cartel owns 51% of the hashrate, they can reverse transactions.
That said, you can see the mining centralization for yourself.  
Here's bitcoin's top mining groups: 
Here's ethereums:

How about people upgrade their software and start using SegWit before complaining about blocksize?
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:55:00
Not necessarily.  It depends on how many existing transactions could be eliminated with widespread LN adoption.  If 90% of the transactions happening on-chain today move to lightning, there's no need for a block size increase.
That's not the same as saying there will never need to be a blocksize increase.  Keeping the size smaller, however, keeps mining very decentralized.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:08:11
Absolutely!  My issue with the blocksize increase is that users have still not migrated to SegWit.  It's simple fact that SegWit allows twice as many transactions to fit into a block.  This is a win-win for everyone -- essentially 2MB blocks without adding to propagation delay.
I do believe core is hoping high fees will strongly encourage users to upgrade.
If SegWit is widely adopted and fees are still high, I absolutely support the blocksize increase. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:33:55
Huh?  That's the ultimate optimization -- infinitely many transactions that don't need to settle on the main blockchain without the need to trust in a third party.  I'm baffled how you can even spin this as a negative.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:58:01
Why are central lightning nodes bad?
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:17:17
Yawn.  Please stop trying to make the transaction problem an issue solely for bitcoin.  Most cryptocurrences have a small fraction of the transaction volume bitcoin has.  There's no point in even comparing them.  
Bcash, for instance, can't even scrap together another transactions to form a 50kb block.
Ethereum chose to sacrifice decentralization for transaction throughput.
No one has figured out the silver bullet for scaling transactions per second yet.  Stop pretending other coins have.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:43:17
How about people upgrade their clients and start using SegWit which is available now, today?  Once the majority of transactions are SegWit transactions we can discuss blocksize again.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:54:13
LN is not a silver bullet.  It's just one solution to the transaction problem.  Do you agree that once a channel is open, many transactions that would previously be onchain can be completely eliminated?
Do you agree that compressing the number of transactions which can fit in a block is equivalent to increasing blocksize?  In fact, isn't compression preferable to blocksize increase?  SegWit and Schnorr signatures aim to do just that.
So rather than jump to 10GB blocks as bcash would have us do...why not encourage users to start using these more efficient scaling techniques before increasing block size?
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:19:37
Proof of stake is not a replacement for proof of work.  Also, there's serious issues with all PoS proposals:  .  There's a reason it's vaporware.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:54:06
So that's a broad term.  
There's mining centralization, which is bad because it may lead to a 51% attack.
There's node centralization, which is bad because you risk consensus rules being easily changed.
What sort of centralization will LN introduce and why is it bad?
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:03:57
I agree that fees on the blockchain should be reasonable.  I do not, however, see the Bitcoin developers as some malevolent individuals trying to ruin the coin.
Their concerns are legitimate.  Increasing block size increases propagation delay which may lead to mining centralization.  I strongly prefer their choice to compress transactions instead of increasing blocksize.  
It's simple fact that SegWit can fit twice as many transactions in a block than non-segwit.  Encouraging users to upgrade makes sense.
Schnorr signatures will double the amount of transactions that can fit into a block yet again.
The above compression techniques is equivalent to introducing 4MB blocks without introducing propagation delay.  LN will remove at least some transactions that previously needed to be onchain.
I honestly don't see the problem.  Fees are absolutely an issue.  That doesn't mean we should recklessly increase blocksize.  Mining centralization is also a real and serious concern.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:46:55
I think the closest real world example to 2 is ATMs:  You go to the ATM to withdrawal some cash (this is equivalent to opening a channel).  You are then free to transact in cash all day long.  At the end of the day, you return to the ATM and deposit any remaining cash you have.
With lightning, I'm not forced to use any one node.  I can open a channel to anyone.  If I don't want to use lightning at all, I don't have to -- I can still use a regular bitcoin transaction.
The hope is that by providing LN as an *option* to use, the number of onchain transactions will be significantly less thereby reducing fees.  LN is not a silver-bullet, just one more arrow in your quiver to address transaction scaling.
What's wrong with this?

If hoarding is a problem, why not tax wealth?  That's what Roosevelt did to get us out the depression - high taxes on the rich which was the reinvested in public works projects.


Inflation is obviously negative to anyone who's given it an ounce of thought.  Inflation forces labor to continuously fight for the same wage.  Inflation enables governments to have endless wars since they never need to explicitly tax you.  Wealthy have the ability to shelter their wealth in inflation-resistant assets (look around at realestate) while the poor fall further and further behind.
You're an idiot if think fiat currency is good.

Have you heard of the government confiscating gold?  Or paper gold IOUs being fraudulently issued?  Are you also ignorant to gold heists throughout history?


In that case you're just dumb.  If you accept gold, you're responsible for guaranteeing it's purity.  History is ripe with examples of governments and people intentionally diluting gold with impurities to make it appear as more.  Far more work is needed to securely accept gold than is needed to accept bitcoin.


Your insurance is in the dollar-value of your gold.  If it gets stolen, you won't get your gold back.
You're clearly quite dumb.  I'm sorry I needed to explain such basic concepts to you.  Enjoy your gold, I'm sure it'll impress many elderly people.  As for the rest of us, we've moved on to a money which is engineered to have perfect characteristics.

Go read once in awhile.  They frequently compare lightning to IOU's and banks.  They get all excited calling LN a "centralized" solution.  They are adamant the LN routing model will never work.  They hate the idea that you need to open and close channels to use LN.  They routinely criticize the fact that an online-node needs to monitor for a misbehaving party.  
You're trying to make this only about segwit when in reality, the bcash crowd has a myriad of hate regarding LN.
