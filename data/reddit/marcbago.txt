Zero stroke or cipher stroke was an alleged mental disorder, reportedly diagnosed by physicians in Germany during the hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic (1921–24). The disorder was primarily characterized by the desire of patients to write endless rows of zeros, which are also referred to as ciphers.
Background	
Weimar Republic hyperinflation from one to one trillion paper Marks per gold Mark. Note the logarithmic scale
Germany, 1923: banknotes had lost so much value that they were used as wallpaper.
Main article: Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic
After the Treaty of Versailles, which formally ended World War I in 1919, Germany faced a damaged economy and a requirement to pay immense war reparations to the Allies. At the beginning of 1921, the German currency was relatively stable at about 60 Marks per US Dollar,[1] but inflation rapidly increased after August 1921, and the Mark fell to less than one third of a cent by November 1921 (approx. 330 Marks per US Dollar). The Mark stabilized again at the beginning of 1922, but when there was no resolution to the reparations problem the inflation changed to hyperinflation and the Mark fell to 8000 Marks per Dollar by December 1922. The inflation reached its peak by November 1923 when a new currency (the Rentenmark) was introduced.
Cause	
The zero stroke disorder was supposedly caused by the dizzying speed of hyperinflation and the calculations required to conduct commerce under its effect. It has been said that during the worst period of hyperinflation that in the time it took to drink a cup of coffee, the price for the cup could double.[2] The fast pace of hyperinflation caused people to quickly buy goods when they received their wages.[2] Workers would demand to be paid at the beginning of the day for their work and after they were paid, they would be given half an hour to run off to buy goods before their earnings became worthless.[2] The requirements to calculate and recalculate commercial transactions in the billions and trillions made it practically impossible to do business in paper Marks.[2]
Description	
Zero stroke has been described in slightly different terms by various authors.
One Time article that reported on the condition described it as follows:
With the price of bread running into billions a loaf the German people have had to get used to counting in thousands of billions. This, according to some German physicians, brought on a new nervous disease known as "zero stroke," or "cipher stroke," which may, however, be classed with neuritis as cipheritis. The persons afflicted with the malady are perfectly normal, except "for a desire to write endless rows of ciphers and engage in computations more involved than the most difficult problems in logarithms."[3]
Another newspaper article at the time described the condition as:
Zero stroke is the name of the latest German ailment. It is the nervous affliction of bookkeepers who grow dizzy from the number of ciphers that must be set in a row after the integers before German marks are sufficiently numerous to come within hailing distance of real money.[4]
Cashiers, bookkeepers, and bankers were reportedly the most prone to this affliction.[2] Besides a compulsion to write endless strings of zeros, individuals that suffered from this condition would reportedly become confused when referring to numbers and would state that they were ten billion years old or had forty trillion children.[2]
Later John Kenneth Galbraith would describe the condition in his 1975 book Money: Whence It Came, Where It Went:
'Zero stroke' or 'cipher stroke' is the name created by German physicians for a prevalent nervous malady brought about by the present fantastic currency figures. Scores of cases of the 'stroke' are reported among men and women of all classes, who have been prostrated by their efforts to figure in thousands of millions. Many of these persons are apparently normal, except for their desire to write endless rows of ciphers.[5]

I see what he’s saying. You’d have absolutely no recourse if you one day woke up at 5am and found ‘unauthorized’ bitcoin transactions from your wallet.
With our current understanding of the bitcoin protocol there is no chance that your wallet would have this/these unauthorized transaction(s) due to bitcoin itself. The centralized equivalent of this is a website’s database being compromised. This won’t/can’t happen with bitcoin.
Someone doing bitcoin stuff on a device that is compromised can of course result in the loss of bitcoin for that person due to ‘unauthorized’ transactions. Same applies with PayPal and etc.
I appreciate you sharing your story with this post. Your choice of words and style made it entertaining to read... despite feeling frustrated myself while reading about your plight! However this does not change the fact that you would be shit out of luck if this was your bitcoin that was transferred away.
The question is- what do you suspect the point of weakness was that allowed someone to gain access to your account? Were you yourself the point of weakness?

Hello all
Late 20s male
About 5 days ago I noticed I was having very dull pains in my upper left abdomen. I didn't think much about it but it kept hurting very slightly even after a couple days. I inspect in the mirror and I see it's sort of swelling/lumpish.
I went to an Urgent Care and the doctor gave me a physical and said they didn't really see or feel the lump I was talking about. Its very light on the surface so only visible with the right light shining on it. It's also not hard, it's more squishy/fatty-like.
They decided to give me an X-ray anyway and the images came back with nothing visible in that area.
Now, I have virtually no other symptoms besides the constant dull pain and the semi-visible localized swelling/lump. The pain doesn't seem to worsen even if I cough, bend over, etc. It's just constant (2/10 pain) dullness.
About a day or 2 prior to all of this, I remember having a stuffed nose and blowing extremely hard, probably the hardest I've ever blown my nose in my life (was frustrated and lost my patience). There was no immediate pain when I did that, could the pain have been delayed if I tore/stretched at the abdomen? Or would have I noticed the pain immediately? I am hoping that this is the cause but am unsure. I blew my left nostril and the pain/swell is on the left side abdomen just a day or two after.
The doctor told me to go get a CT scan to make sure. I'm really scared here to be honest.
I guess my questions are:
1) do you think blowing my nose hard could have caused this?
2) the xray came back with no mass or any other concern in that area, does this mean chances are everything is okay?
3) could it be a hernia? The only reason I don't think it's that is because it doesn't hurt more when I cough or bend over/picking things up. It's just constant 2/10 dull pain
4) if doctor didn't seem too worried, should I do the same? Really freaking out here the past couple of days.
Thanks so much. I really really mean it. Thanks so much for taking the time to respond it seriously means the world to me right now.
Edit: here are a couple pics of the area

He changed the focus from shithole country to citizens of said country.
What I also find odd is his perspective seems to be that a country’s culture/history cannot be studied/embraced/appreciated at a distance. Newsflash- you don’t have to be within a country to learn about a country.

Don’t use a custodial service such as EPICMIXERDOTCOM! but instead check out the Wasabi Wallet- this wallet has a built in coin mixing feature and it is my understanding that the coins remain in your control the entire time.
There’s no promises when you send your coins to one of those random websites. Nowadays you most likely will just end up losing coins and will never get anything in return. 
I have not yet checked out the Wasabi Wallet, but it is highly recommended for its coin join mixing feature.

it is my personal belief that the person you responded to exaggerated 'almost' buying back in at 'triple the price' and that their 'friend talked them out of it.' if this is the case and they were exaggerating, i'd say your advice is solid.
assuming what they wrote was not exaggerated and an accurate recollection of what happened, i'd say the better, more solid advice to give this person is to recommend to them that they stay away from trading/buying/selling coins in any capacity, entirely, period. it's day zero for bch on gdax and for someone to 'almost' be making such an uncalculated and poor investment decision on day zero says to me that unless their end goal is to be in the red they should not be playing in these waters. relying on a 'smart friend' as they did is unwise as well- any turn of events imaginable where the smart friend's advice turns out to not be sound will lead to feeling like the blame needs to be placed on the friend for the financial loss or simply the return not being maximized

That was Principles. His new book is less focused on the abstract. Read the first chapter or two on Amazon's look inside feature. Or at least the preface. The whole book is free.  It's interesting enough. I did some part-time contractor work sporadically for Bridgewater for a few years and it's a mostly normal environment in terms of corporate culture. His Principles book was new at the time. I have a few physical copies myself. I'm not so sure if it is or ever was some sort of cult-like robotic directive that the employees adhere to. A coworker of mine recalled a time he saw an employee in flip flops absorbed Minecraft at his standing desk. Cash Rules Everything Around Me was very prominently written on the top of one of their largest whiteboards in one of the central areas for weeks. We're all human. I witnessed plenty of mismanagement.

Traditional bitcoin? Sounds like you’re from the BCH camp. Google search appeal to tradition. Segwit, for the uninformed, reshapes bitcoin transactions slightly (and insignificantly, in terms of safety/security, it’s not any less secure than “traditional” bitcoin) to make them smaller in size, which in turn allows them to be less costly on the blockchain because more transactions can fit into the same amount of space as “traditional” bitcoin.

I know I shouldn’t have written it absolutely like that- that you need an internet connection. You don’t.
For sending the atm your btc and having it dispense cash, however, you do. Or at least an intermediary form of communication that ends up communicating over the internet.
The atm I’ve been using to withdraw cash from has like a 180 second countdown for you to send the btc to the address they provide, so using something like text messaging or satellite might just be too slow.
See my response to Fabulous_Anywhere for some more details on the atm I use.

Funny how bch is absent from the list! I do indeed wonder how this stand conducts the crypto side of their business. Perhaps they prefer to do off-chain transactions such as a Coinbase to Coinbase transaction. Zero fees and instant, woohoo, but at the cost of the transaction being permissioned. Which for some is not the end of the world/not a dealbreaker. The other option would be for the buyer to be responsible for the fee that would get the transaction confirmed in an amount of time that would be reasonable for them. For example if they intend to spend 4 hours at the county fair, well, set the lowest fee you can set. If you’re looking for a next-block confirmation, if you want your bag of beans in the next 15 minutes, then set the right fee for that! Being able to stroll around the fair and go to the different booths and whatever makes it a little better than other scenarios where you and the other party have to hang around twiddling your thumbs waiting for a confirmation. I use a btc atm to make withdrawals sometimes and have to initiate a withdrawal then wait for 1 confirmation before being able to get the physical cash from the atm. I end up waiting around for ~15 minutes usually (~12-~17 from my experiences) and always get all antsy, heh. Really not a long amount of time, though. Plus the atm uses segwit and does not charge an arm and a leg for additional fees. I also send from CB Pro to avoid miner fees. The atm takes like 6 bucks. Obviously I would prefer 0 bucks to be taken, or like 1 or 2, but 6 is not too bad. If I’m withdrawing 200 bucks it’s negligible.

A brainwallet refers to the concept of storing Bitcoins in one's own mind by memorizing a seed phrase. If the seed is not recorded anywhere, the Bitcoins can be thought of as being held only in the mind of the owner. If a brainwallet is forgotten or the person dies or is permanently incapacitated, the Bitcoins are lost forever. Using memory techniques allow them to be memorized and recalled easily.
To create a brainwallet, use Bitcoin wallet software to generate a seed phrase and then memorize it. Such seeds are generated by wallets like Electrum, Armory and Mycelium.
Brainwallets are not recommended to be used in general because of fallible human memory. But in special situations they could be very useful, for example when fleeing a country with only the clothes on your back.

Worked Example
On a computer with no malware, run Electrum and generate a seed phrase.
Memorize the phrase using 
When spending or saving, restore the wallet from memory using the phrase.
Use the master public key to create an online watch-only wallet, where you can send to but not spend.
Spend from the wallet in the manner of deep cold storage. Transferring the unsigned transaction to the cold storage computer, signing it and broadcasting to the network.
Example Mnemonic Peg
To memorize a seed with this method you must invent a story which hits the words as "keynotes". Try to make it like a fairy tale story, use imagery. Make it somehow striking and emotionally resonant. When remembering you just remember the key words, not all the other words - the other can be remembered more as images and thoughts (which are hard to write down)
Let's say we have this seed:
   witch collapse practice feed shame open despair creek road again ice least
You'd imagine walking through a building familiar to you, maybe your own home or workplace or school.
You imagine looking in the first room and seeing your mother dressed as a witch, playing the jenga boardgame until the tower collapses.
You walk to the next room and see your father practising with a longbow, he shoots a chicken to feeds himself.
In the next room you see your brother naked in shame attempting to cover himself, he's looking through a window that's open and flapping in the wind.
Now you reach the kitchen, girlfriend is looking at Picasso's Guernica on the wall. She is in despair from it. Next to it is a television playing the show Dawson's Creek.
Next you're in the garage, your childhood friend is working on his car. He plans to go on a road trip for the 5th time this month, he's going again.
Finally to go outside to the garden. It's early spring and the ground is covered in melting ice. Two of your other friends are there, one friend has a huge basket of apples, the other has a smaller basket but you're holding only some apples. You've got the least apples.
Repeat this story in your head several times over a short period - the first few days. It will sink in, deep, after that. You'll only have to revisit it very occasionally. After a while you can ignore it for months and it'll still come back, not that I'd recommend relying on that.
Video Example of Mnemonic Peg Method
From the BBC documentary The Human Mind (2003) by Professor Robert Winston. Approximately 31 minutes in. Memorizing a list of 30 random words.
Fallible Memory Warning
Despite the memory aids, human memory can be very fallible. So if your only storage is memory you may find that it just vanished one day.
Data should always be backed up. Storing a seed phrase in one place is bad, even if that one place is your brain.

Visionary Bitcoin Creator Satoshi Nakamoto to Reveal Identity
Founder of Satoshi Nakamoto Renaissance Holdings to disclose the origins of his iconic pseudonym and the word Bitcoin on Sunday, Aug. 18, in the first installment of his three-part daily epiphany “My Reveal” on  and 
  
August 16, 2019 16:00 ET | Source: Ivy McLemore &amp; Associates
NEW YORK, Aug. 16, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- After a decade of anonymity, Satoshi Nakamoto will break his silence in Part I of his “My Reveal” Sunday, Aug. 18, at 4 p.m. EDT on the Satoshi Nakamoto Renaissance Holdings website,  and the Ivy McLemore &amp; Associates website, 
In addition to his real-life identity, Nakamoto will use “My Reveal” to divulge such facts as his country of origin, education, professional background, and why he has yet to move any of his 980,000 bitcoins.
Indicative of the compelling evidence he presents in each part of the series, Nakamoto will illustrate the role that cyphers and encryption related to his devotion to Chaldean numerology played in many decisions in his creation of Bitcoin.
Nakamoto also will disclose why he chose the date August 18 not only to register bitcoin.org in 2008, but also to release Part I of “My Reveal” this coming Sunday on the 11th anniversary of his registration of bitcoin.org through AnonymousSpeech.com.
Nakamoto’s revelations will culminate Tuesday in Part III with his introduction of Tabula Rasa, his clean-slate vision for Bitcoin’s transformational rebirth, and the declaration of his identity.
The final two parts of Nakamoto’s “My Reveal” will post to  and  on Monday and Tuesday at 4 p.m. EDT.

I’m wondering- did you add a meme filter to the text in your post because of the notorious bitcoin pizza purchase from way back when? I think we have passed the point where spending nowadays will be looked at as a blunder in the future.
And that doesn’t matter anyway because consuming calories isn’t optional unfortunately. Even if r/frugaljerk might say otherwise. I have to buy food one way or another.

I’m guilty of similar... I actually made a couple of Coinbase purchases totaling to around $300 in August ‘18 and totally forgot about them. Seriously! Up until like 2 weeks ago. Except for me that had nothing to do with me putting that garbage in my body. Only the white china for me, baby. And of course it ain’t nothing if we ain’t also banging some amphetamine to go with it. Yee-haw! One of my old roommates was a gangbanger so we would consistently be all doped up. And when you’re a connected Latin King, well, the dope comes in hot. Like, knock you on your ass, hot, or like, overdose if you’re not careful, hot. It’s funny because you’d never guess this guy had like 20 bundles of heroin on him all the time. His thing I’m pretty sure was smoking crack. In terms of the upper side of things. I never really got direct confirmation that he was smoking crack, though. He would however sometimes spend like 3 or 4 hours in the bathroom and not make a sound. It took me like 3 months before I even realized there was anything remotely to the degree of what was being trafficked basically directly in my presence before I quickly got thrown into the mix and look at me now, the resultant of being chewed up and spit out, with a gigantic monkey on my back-multiple drug addictions- which I am the victim of being in perpetual, incurable withdrawal from. At least he did warn me the first time if I was sure I wanted to participate. But anyway, yeah, with heroin, everything gets all blurry like Xanax, but if you also got something like Adderall to go with it, it’s a whole different story. You can literally climb Everest or K2 with that combination alone. Actually, if you look into it, loads of these adventurer guys were pumping themselves full of pervitin, or something like that, which was basically a combination of an opioid and amphetamine. Now the question is, just how much do you want to climb Everest?

The other day I checked just for shiggles and $200 got me more via the cash app vs Coinbase. My intention was making an on-the-spot purchase, so gdax would not have done the trick. Something like the difference between 0.016 and 0.017. I didn’t even end up making the purchase, however.

I have used btc atms numerous times &amp;amp;amp; have made withdrawals... yes, you can exchange your btc for cash. The overwhelming majority of atms provide cash -&gt; btc, but btc -&gt; cash atms exist.
The atm I have been frequenting offers about $1,000 under spot price.
For ~67.00 USD I can pull out $60 cash. This is just an example. I’ve pulled out all sorts of different increments over time, 60, 80, 120, 160, 180. I’ve sent the btc to the atm addresses straight from my Coinbase Pro account, so I see the USD equivalent of what I’m sending out in real time.
This process requires an internet connection. Or at the very least, some intermediary form of communication that ends up interacting with the internet, for example, text messaging.
I’ve used this service as recently as last week... shit, earlier this week, actually. CoinBTM / Cottonwood Vending is who I’ve been using here in NYC. There’s also Coinsource, but I’m unaware of any nearby atms of theirs that permit withdrawals— if any.

That website purposely overcharges you to discourage you from buying BTC. They keep something like a quarter of what you purchase as a fee. Roger Ver owns the bitcoin,com website and btc subreddit and they both exist solely to confuse newcomers and have them instead purchase their shitcoin spinoff known as ‘bitcoin cash,’ do not buy bitcoin (the real bitcoin, the original bitcoin, BTC) from that website.

Thank you very much for sharing. When did you first hear about bitcoin? I am naturally very skeptical of things and made sure to put aside as much time as I could to research bitcoin, and everything I’ve seen written about it in the last 10 years and looking at it from the 2019 perspective just is a huge selling point in my eyes for btc’s worth. We have passed the point of experiment. The 20k bubble was easily survived. The bch fork was easily survived. Btc has effortlessly shrugged off everything thrown at it so far, it even bounced right back from MtGox when it may have been most vulnerable. It is however concerning to see btc.top and btc.com communicating together in a private channel... speaking about mining pools being a point of weakness.

How much is 1/10th of a bitcoin worth in united states dollars? Or are you asking the bitcoin-focused community if owning *any* amount of bitcoin is an achievement? Hello, bitcoin community, is it an achievement if I own enough bitcoin to wipe my ass with? What do you expect the answers to basically be? Good job, you have enough disposable cash’s worth to pay a month of rent in the first world. Are you in Venezuela? Or Mogadishu? Pyongyang? $800 USD or 1/10th of a single bitcoin might get you further in places like these, and if you are, congratulations! ��
And if you’re not, and I’m pretty sure you’re not, how’s mom’s basement?
The obvious answer to your question is to buy as much bitcoin as you can afford to and then to continue to buy more over time. Buy 1/10th of a bitcoin right now and buy an additional x worth continuously on a weekly/monthly basis for the next x years. Duh!

This is actually a good point. Those btc atms should leave a paper trail. Actually, thinking about it now, it’s impossible. You can’t KYC external, receiving addresses. Only the addresses of people who use your machines. The atm machines operate on the entire network, not just between themselves. Taking it up with the atm operator is like saying transactions should be censored to only be able to interact with whitelisted addresses that they have verifiable KYC on. That would be pretty crappy for bitcoin, but could totally limit this kind of fraud, at least to some degree. But truth be told, the woman was about to buy these fraudsters iTunes gift cards, it sounds like she’s the one that’s really ‘at fault’ here, I mean what, iTunes has to verify the kyc of the recipients of their gift cards? Is that even possible? They could just have a crackhead put their kyc in on the bitcoin atm at that point, in order to make the w/ds without a paper trail pointing to them directly.

It’s pretty standard in the bitcoin atm industry. She probably just tapped through it without reading it. It took to the point of the store employee telling her she was buying iTunes gift cards for scammers, she’s the one at fault here, not the atm operator, who likely has a screen with a warning for this exact kind of fraud in bold.

Far-future locks
It is not advised to lock up bitcoins into the far future because it takes on risk of the bitcoin network changing. For example, if there were an ECDSA or RIPEMD160 algorithm break that made any coins spendable with a few months of CPU time, the network might need to to prohibit moving old unspent coins after some transition, but long locktimed coins could not make such a transition.
OP_CheckSequenceVerify allows locking for at most 65535 blocks (about 455 days) or for at most 65535*512 seconds (about 388 days). OP_CheckLockTimeVerify could be used to lock up coins for several centuries.

Sorry, but it wasn't the "genuine Electrum software" that sent you this message. It was the malicious server you were connected to unfortunately. This is the actual vulnerability/exploit being used in action. They broadcast the message to their connected clients to upgrade to the malware version, client then downloads malware from the link provided in the message rather than from the official electrum link, electrum.org. Which is exactly what you did, so yes you actually did go to the website and download it yourself. Electrum had no part in this other than the GUI. Always check build versions against the official mirror or github page. Malware will always be advertised as a "newer" version.

I was alarmed earlier when I learned about this exploit. Is the HTML injection exploit fixed in the most recent versions? If not I'm afraid I may have to find a different wallet. Bitdefender was alerting me to a generic Trojan within the Electrum .exe as well. Lots of ph(f)ishy things going on that I'd rather not have to deal with. There really isn't any reason that nodes should be allowed to display messages to users.

Had this happen to me yesterday, lost $10. Apparently without knowing, I connected to a malicious server exploiting the HTML vulnerability in older clients. I was trying to transfer my reimbursement from nicehash hack to my bitpay. Once I realized it was a hacked client with a trojan horse, it was too late. Do the following at this time.
*Consider the coins lost
*Re-Install a Clean Copy of Windows
*Consider any wallets you loaded in the client, all private keys compromised. So transfer any funds out of them ASAP.
*Finally, always get a updated client from official website
It sucks, I was planing to get some food that night with it. But we got played. Spread awareness to others about it.

And by the way, for anyone looking for more of an in-depth explanation for the guy’s mention of wasabi wallet- wasabi wallet is a wallet with the decentralized CoinJoin feature.
CoinJoin is a trustless method for combining multiple Bitcoin payments from multiple spenders into a single transaction to make it more difficult for outside parties to determine which spender paid which recipient or recipients. Unlike many other privacy solutions, coinjoin transactions do not require a modification to the bitcoin protocol.
This type of transaction was first described in posts[1][2] by gmaxwell.
Bitcoin is often promoted as a tool for privacy but the only privacy that exists in Bitcoin comes from pseudonymous addresses which are fragile and easily compromised through reuse, "taint" analysis, tracking payments, IP address monitoring nodes, web-spidering, and many other mechanisms. Once broken this privacy is difficult and sometimes costly to recover.
PSEUDONYMOUS IN THE SECOND PARAGRAPH, WOW!
Maybe you need to do a little learning about bitcoin, lmfao!
Try reading the whole article! Check out the citations! Boy there are some idiots on here!




This article needs to be updated, because AFAIK, Wasabi Wallet is capable of doing coinjoins!
It increases anonymity, but ultimate bitcoin as a whole is still pseudonymous. For example, if you send your whole entire coinjoined amount straight to a new wallet address, hell, for example’s sake, let’s say everyone in your anonymity set sends their entire coinjoined balance in full straight to a new address, the coinjoined is made less anonymous/less secure. In the example of everyone doing that, it’s my understanding that the coinjoin is completely ruined and everyone is as identifiable as they were before doing a coinjoin. So even coinjoining is not infallible.
Plus keep in mind these stories that pop up around here of people posing as a girlfriend and being like “the authorities knocked down my door and arrested my boyfriend for coinjoining bitcoins. he’s looking at life in prison. help,” so I’m not trying to discourage anyone, but you be the judge if it’s worth cleaning your coins but effectively getting back El Chapo’s and Little Kim’s bitcoins.
Anyone who builds this is going to be accused of enabling criminal activity, it doesn't matter if any actual criminals use this or not: Criminal activity sells headlines. Being a Bitcoin core developer already fills my quota for accusations of this kind, especially my quota for risk that I'm not even paid for. :)
In reality, real criminals don't need CoinJoin if they have even the slightest clue: They can afford to buy privacy in a way that regular users cannot, it's just a cost of their (often lucrative) business.
Joe-criminal can go out and buy 120% PPS mining to get brand new coins, or run his money through a series of semi-sham high cashflow gambling businesses for a 50% cut, they can afford the cost of seeking out and interfacing with these seedy services... Joe and Jane doe? Their names are up in neon on blockchain.info. It might not seem great to them, but if there a high cost of fixing it they simply won't, because the cost of fixing it is very concrete and the cost or privacy loss is speculative and distant. They might just need to give up bitcoin and switch to something almost totally private: cash... Regular users need efficient and inexpensive privacy if it is to help them at all.
Interesting stuff!

One thing I remember reading was that there was software developed in response to the style of his arrest- he was arrested with his laptop in an unlocked/unencrypted state after two FBI agents posing as a girlfriend and boyfriend fighting distracted him- that upon detection of a usb drive getting unplugged- the idea being that a usb is attached to a lanyard around your wrist- the drives start encrypting themselves, or maybe deleting/overwriting them too. I think it’s on the Wikipedia. Unrelated, but super interesting stuff in terms of security! I don’t know how many Ross Ulbricht types we have on this subreddit though. I’m definitely not one. Was that enough dashes for you, by the way?
To prevent Ulbricht from encrypting or deleting files on the laptop he was using to run the site as he was arrested, two agents pretended to be quarreling lovers. When they had sufficiently distracted him,[28] according to Joshuah Bearman of Wired, a third agent grabbed the laptop while Ulbricht was distracted by the apparent lovers' fight and handed it to agent Thomas Kiernan.[29] Kiernan then inserted a flash drive in one of the laptop's USB ports, with software that copied key files.[28]
[28] Bertrand, Natasha (May 29, 2015). "The FBI staged a lovers' fight to catch the kingpin of the web's biggest illegal drug marketplace". Business Insider. Retrieved May 30, 2016.
[29] "Trial Transcript, Day 2, page 856" (PDF). January 21, 2015. Retrieved January 21, 2015. Cite web requires |website= (help)
The program's developer, who goes by the online name Hephaest0s, created it in response to the circumstances of the arrest of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, during which U.S. federal agents were able to get access to incriminating evidence on his laptop without needing his cooperation by copying data from its flash drive after distracting him.[3] It maintains a whitelist of devices allowed to connect to the computer's USB ports; if a device not on that whitelist connects, it can take actions ranging from merely returning to the lock screen to encrypting the hard drive, or even deleting all the data on it. However, it can also be used as part of a computer security regimen to prevent the surreptitious installation of malware or spyware or the clandestine duplication of files, according to its creator.[4]
When law enforcement agencies began making computer crime arrests in the 1990s, they would often ask judges for no knock search warrants, in order to deny their targets time to delete incriminating evidence from computers or storage media. In more extreme circumstances where it was likely that the targets could get advance notice of arriving police, judges would grant "power-off" warrants, allowing utilities to turn off the electricity to the location of the raid shortly beforehand, further forestalling any efforts to destroy evidence before it could be seized. These methods were effective against criminals who produced and distributed pirated software and movies, the primary large-scale computer crime of the era.[1]
By the 2010s, the circumstances of computer crime had changed along with legitimate computer use. Criminals were more likely to use the Internet to facilitate their crimes, and as such needed to remain online most of the time. To do so, and still keep their activities discreet, they used computer security features like lock screens and password protection.[1]
For those reasons, law enforcement now attempts to apprehend suspected cybercriminals with their computers on and in use, all accounts both on the computer and online open and logged in, thus easily searchable.[1] If they do not succeed in seizing the computer in that condition, there are some methods available to bypass password protection, but these may take more time than police have available. Nor may it be legally possible to compel the suspect to relinquish his or her password—in the United States, where many computer-crime investigations take place, courts have distinguished between forcing a suspect to use material means of protecting data such as a thumbprint, retinal scan or key as opposed to a password or passcode, which is purely the product of the suspect's mental processes and is thus protected from compelled disclosure by the Fifth Amendment.[5]
The usual technique for authorities, either public entities such as law enforcement or private organizations like companies, seizing a computer (usually a laptop) that they believe is being used improperly is to first physically separate the suspect user from the computer enough that he or she cannot touch it, to prevent them from closing its lid, unplugging it or typing a command. Once they have done so, they often install a device in the USB port that spoofs minor actions of a mouse, touchpad or keyboard, preventing the computer from going into sleep mode, from which it would usually return to a lock screen which would require a password.[6] One program commonly used for this purpose is Mouse Jiggler.[4][6][7]
Ross Ulbricht arrest	
Agents with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigating Ross Ulbricht, founder of the online black market Silk Road, learned that he often ran the site from his laptop, using the wireless networks available at branches of the San Francisco Public Library. When they had enough evidence to arrest him, they planned to catch him in the act of running Silk Road, with his computer on and logged in. They needed to make sure he was not able to trigger any encryption or delete evidence when they did.[3]
In October 2013, a male and female agent pretended to have a lovers' quarrel near where he was working at the Glen Park branch. According to Business Insider Ulbricht was distracted and got up to see what the problem was, whereupon the female agent grabbed his laptop while the male agent restrained Ulbricht. The female agent was then able to insert a flash drive in one of the laptop's USB ports, with software that copied key files.[3] According to Joshuah Bearman of Wired, a third agent grabbed the laptop while Ulbricht was distracted by the apparent lovers' fight and handed it to agent Tom Kiernan.[8]

I feel really bad for the person posting this thread/their family. Considering how something like 98% of Americans are like a flat tire away from entering destitute poverty, 2 grand is a pretty significant amount of money to give away.

In about two years time Bitcoin will start to appreciate in value by roughly $1,000 every hour. 
It will make calculating anything tedious[1], but at least it's better than the numbers going the other way around.

You know dumb money is in bitcoin when someone isn’t phased whatsoever over a number ‘growing’ from 17.9 to 17.1

I tried to log into gdax after not using it for a year and a half and couldn’t log in. I should have been buying since 3500. Bitcoin is strong af ��

Here is some email exchange between finney and satoshi
“You can send to my Bitcoin address if you want to, but you won't get to see the full transfer sequence: 1NSwywA5Dvuyw89sfs3oLPvLiDNGf48cPD
You could always findstr /c:"version message" debug.log and send a test to some random person you're connected to near the end of the list. The ones ending in port 8333 can receive connections.
I just thought of something. Eventually there'll be some interest in brute force scanning bitcoin addresses to find one with the first few characters customized to your name, kind of like getting a phone number that spells out something. Just by chance I have my initials.

Thanks for sharing. Wondering if he was being tongue in cheek here-  at the end because he’s brilliant at explaining things thoroughly, if it is in fact nick szabo. I highly recommend you reading thru all the ideas being fleshed out in these email exchanges if you haven’t took a glimpse at them before. Worthwhile

Thank you for sharing! I thought it was a rather unique!

That's your easily manipulated opinion might be my new favorite saying

That sounds super sucky. I’d have been asking myself if this is reality I’m living in with how ridiculous their support replies are

I remember wondering for a second why my trade didn’t execute and it was because I had initially not been looking past the hundredths place
