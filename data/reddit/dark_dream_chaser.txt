No. China dos not do it. Yet. Don't be naive. My be they do some researches with small amount to mature their reserve techniques. But not more. Most people don't understand how huge chine economy is. If they decide to spent at least 0.0001 % of their reserves to buy BTC we will see at least 10x of current prices in several days.

Just look at [sportsbet.io](
They accept BTC, LTC, Ethereum. And it's a sponsor of Flamengo (Brazil, Serie A) and Whatford FC (England, Primer League).  This is the most expensive sponsorship deals related to bookies accepting cryprocurrency. Did not see something like this before.
EDIT: They are not accepting USA residents.

How can I proof to other that I have no privet key to this address ?

What is the best way to burn bitcoin then ? With solid proof that the coins will never be spent.

You spent a lot of hours studing it and gave nitrogensports 10/10 in odds category ? 
Nitrogensports is the oldest one on the market and one of the most reliable bitcoin betting platforms, but they offer very bad odds (they copy paste pinncale lines and add extra juicy).

I use "freebitco" for small and not urgent on chain payments. They pay interest rates, and have low fees for "slow" daily withdraw.  They are the oldest facet site on the market and does not have any scam acquisitions. 
But even  if it has a good history please don't store any significant amount of BTC on any third party service (exchanges, non-custodial wallets, gambling sites, etc.)

There is a lot, but those three are the best IMHO.
EDIT: You should use at least five bookie and always pick better odds.  Also don't store significant amount of funds on any site.

What hidden fees are You talking about:
Let's look at today's most popular soccer market:
Brescia vs Inter Milan (for example OVER 2.5 goals)
Betfair - 2.5% from winnings no any market
Matchbook - 2% from winnings no any market
Most asian brockers:  OVER 1.95 vs UNDER 1.99 The bookmaker takes a margin of 1.53% (payout is: 98.47%).
Fairlay : OVER 1.917 vs 1.990  The bookmaker takes a margin of 2.42% (payout is: 97.58%).
I will get even better odds right before kickoff.
For NHL, NBA, EPL and champion league matches you can bet with near zero fees just shopping around those 5 platforms.
Give me some examples (markets) where I can get better payout using Wager ?
6% fees is not appropriate nowadays, it's a robbery  and any smart punter should avoid such a huge commission.

This banner has nothing to do with Manchester United FC. It's sportsbet and Watford fc promo campaign.

Yes. One of the biggest problems we have.

Ukraine is a Bitcoin paradise. No taxes at all if you know the basics. But on the other hand there is no social protection, total corruption and Russian aggression.

Miners. At some point (when block reward drops significantly) it can became more profitable to crack old addresses then mine new blocks.
@_date: 2019-12-24 04:32:50
Hash power that behind big miners will allow them to crack not active addresses. The only way to protect bitcoins will be to move them constantly to new generated addresses or significantly improve protection of btc (hard fork). It's inevitable in the near future  (5 - 10 years IMHO).
@_date: 2019-12-22 20:40:37
Why not? For example [sportsbet.io]( "on the banner" use bitcoin for sports betting (don't convert to fiat crypto-accounts by default).

6% from winnings = worst fees on the market. "Wager" should lower their fees otherwise they will never succeed.
@_date: 2019-12-24 00:56:40
THIS IS SCAM !!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2019-12-24 00:55:15
First and foremost don't send it to anyone.
@_date: 2019-12-24 19:22:40
Tnx. I did more research and looks like you are absolutely right. It's possible to do this kind of computations with modern super computers but it will take hundreds years to find any collision, so bitcoin is safest asset in the word for next 100 years at  least.
@_date: 2019-12-24 04:49:00
Why not ? Any info ? I don't see any obstacles.
