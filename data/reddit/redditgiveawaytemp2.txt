Binance is an exchange, so you'll be subject to their fees, and they may not be as configurable as if you were sending them from your own wallet. It might be possible to view on the website the estimated fees that you will incur before sending the transaction. Some exchanges subtract fees from send amount, some don't, I'm not sure.
I suggest reading also.

[egifter]( sell xbox gift cards and amazon gc's which can be used to buy windows/xbox cards on their site.
[zeek]( is another site that sells xbox/Microsoft/Steam/Amazon cards for Bitcoin.
[giftoff]( is another site that sells amazon cards.
I'm sure there are plenty more gift card sites that accept Bitcoin, using these sites there is still a easy and straightforward way to convert Bitcoin into their respective stores if you choose to do so.

Why is that your metric and how did you come up with it? Any fork is a fork plain and simple; that the majority do not agree with hence that’s why it’s a fork.
Imagine you were in a coma for a year during 2017, and running a full node. You would sync and continue to use Bitcoin as normal, without even knowing about the other forks that require a separate client to use.

Yes of course it can be called a currency. Hyperinflation of currencies can occur, e.g. the Venezuelan bolívar or the German Mark in WWI. For the former the currency is losing value fast that Venezualens put their money into Bitcoin as it is safer and holds value better, and in the latter people weigh cash in wheelbarrows as they kept printing more and more. If you only consider 1st world westernised sovereign currencies like USD and GBP, then yes compared to those it does move much more than those, but that doesn't not make it a currency.

Either way, it changes nothing. Guess they figured that people using Bitcoin vs. people buying microtransactions in their freemium mobile games were mutually exclusive.
Furthermore, both Microsoft and Steam did not really accept the currency in the first place because they converted their Bitcoin straight into USD using a 3rd party integration e.g. Bitpay so I don't buy their argument of it being too unstable as the volatility didn't affect them.

Are there any conclusions to be gained on how "centralized" this network graph is?
Is it possible that the hubs are nodes with good connection speed and hence have a larger number of connections?
Can a node on the outer edge just connect to more peers, as many as they want if it would make it less centralized, and is there any benefit in connecting to lots of peers?
How similar is this to a bittorrent P2P network or a TOR network? How is it possible to view all nodes? With Tor you can connect to a few nodes but it is impossible to view all exit nodes or relay nodes in between at the same time.
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:59:36
the whales are purposefully hitting boundaries to activate all the stop losses and sweep up the profits. you under-estimated the volatility. 50% of ATH is not low lol.
OTOH if the market kept going down to $5,000, you would be saying "thank god i had that stop loss in." who knows, it may go down below $10,000 again in the coming months, and that would be a great opportunity to buy back in.
In the end its your decision to trade recklessly, dont blame the tools that you used, they functioned correctly.

Well, at least they tried it! Bad luck for them, they managed to use it at the peak of high fee season last year, fees are around 10 times lower now. It's like getting onto a crowded bus in rush hour, complaining that you didn't get a seat and then saying you would never use public transport again.

That's the same site lol. 140-160sat/b+ will get confirmed in the next few blocks, anything much lower than 100 sat/b will get discarded in the long term as it goes past the 300 MB limit. So using 150 MB or 300 MB is moot, as long as you have a transaction over the median, it works as usual.

In general you should never install any browser extensions especially those that can see and modify your activity on all websites. Malicious code can be run in the javascript source. Even if it doesn't exist now, chrome extensions can be silently updated to add this.
Looking at your extension, it uses the cloud vision api to see if there is a logo on the site that resembles bitcoin, then updates the icon colour if it does. In my opinion this is not very useful as you can get this infromation from just looking at the website itself.

Yes, you are right. Without withdraw and deposit it is not Bitcoin, it is an entry in a database. Thought they would roll out at the same time when as when they roll the feature out for all users (today), but they keep saying 'soon'. I can no longer recommend it until they add the withdraw/deposit support.

Tracking e.g. 500 payments manually would be a difficult task for anyone. Thats why you need a payment processor or software of some kind to process bitcoin payments efficiently.

Interesting, thanks. so an analogy is like moving money from a safe into your wallet.
Would it be possible to withdraw to a cold wallet via a separate channel, and would that depend on trust? The benefit would be multiple outputs giving a smaller transaction size.
Leading to a question on the same line, would exchanges/companies support lightning wallets that you can send and withdraw from? Can client side wallets exist? e.g. like electrum that doesnt depend on running a full node?

After buying in at £13,500, the value drops to £10,500 and they cash out with 27 euros, minus the exchange and miner fees. They remark that it was a 'bad investment'.
"Who uses it except for drug dealers?" says the host. They discuss the transaction costs, innovation and ability to empower and bank the bankless, move value without regulatory/tax oversight. As well as the volatility, any small amount of news changes the value wildly.
Matt baker calls it bad timing, after recording, the value shot up again. In a one month period lost 1/3 value but year overall is up lots.
How is it mined? Using computing power, electricity to generate it. Uses more than the bottom 150 countries globally, so apparently it's not green.

My bad, what I meant to say is, that is the **minimum** transaction fee that could go through in the next block, if you want to guarantee it you must use a higher fee like 100-150. I can see a few 50-60 sat/byte transactions in the previous few blocks, but most are 100+. Depends a lot also on how many people are sending the same size fee transactions and time of day as well.

copypasta for those behind a paywall:
The price of a Bitcoin has risen tenfold in ten months. Yet whether and when the bubble will burst is beside the point, which is that Bitcoin works. What I mean by this is that Bitcoin has proved that the blockchains technology behind cryptocurrencies is capable of doing what it was claimed it could: create an asset of limited supply and high security, like digital gold.
“Running non-stop for eight years, with almost no financial loss on the chain itself, [Bitcoin] is now in important ways the most reliable and secure financial network in the world,” writes the legal scholar and computer scientist Nick Szabo. This is likely to be a more enduring legacy than any burst bubbles or scandals over the use of cryptocurrencies by drug dealers. Blockchains may change more than money.
Cryptocurrencies are worth north of $300 billion, about half of that being Bitcoin. With 16.7 million Bitcoins in circulation, it is little wonder that there are now Bitcoin billionaires, such as the Winklevoss twins. The biggest such Bitcoin plutocrat is probably its inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto, who is thought to have about a million Bitcoins, worth roughly $10 billion, making him (perhaps briefly) about the 130th richest person in the world. Yet his identity remains a secret, hidden behind a Japanese name, a German IP address, east-coast American hours and British spelling (he also once quoted The Times).
To understand Satoshi’s thinking, it pays to study the writings of Szabo, especially an essay a few months ago called Money, Blockchains, and Social Scalability. As one of the “cypherpunks” who assembled in Santa Cruz in 1992 to discuss how to use computer science to secure property and privacy in cyberspace, Szabo was the inventor of Bit Gold, on which Bitcoin built. Many people think Szabo is Satoshi, since he dropped somewhat out of sight around the time Satoshi popped up, and has a similar writing style. He denies it. (Governments generally prosecute the founders of alternative currencies, usually on dubious pretexts.)
Szabo’s argument is that institutions such as government, markets and money are designed to create “scalability”, to enable us to behave towards numerous strangers with almost as much confidence as we do with a few family and friends. He sees blockchains as an online version of such an institution and argues that human society has not yet evolved to take full advantage of online technology. Uber, Facebook and eBay still have to be actual companies with offices, for example.
Taking his lead from Adam Smith and a remark by Richard Dawkins (“money is a formal token of delayed reciprocal altruism”), Szabo became fascinated by the evolution of money: how humans apparently began around 100,000 years ago to use sea shells as bridewealth, compensation for injury, or inheritance. Later they started using wearable gold, then gold and silver coins, then gold-backed paper IOUs and then fiat currencies as a medium of exchange, a unit of account and a store of value. Szabo dreamed of creating something that was lent value by its scarcity and incorruptibility, but cost nothing to transport: a digital version of gold.
The solution is a network of thousands of computers rewarded for updating a chain of blocks of code, which gradually seal the story of any transaction deeper and deeper inside an increasingly hard-to-crack shell — like a fly in amber, to use Szabo’s analogy. As he writes: “Blockchains don’t guarantee truth; they just preserve truth and lies from later alteration, allowing one to later securely analyse them.”
The goal, says Szabo, is “trust minimisation”. If this sounds paradoxical — surely we want more trust? — then bear with me. Right now you have to trust the Bank of England that a tenner is worth £10, or an accountant that a company is worth what it says, or a lawyer that somebody owns a house she is selling, or a government that somebody is a citizen of the country whose passport they hold. We still rely on human beings, outside cyberspace, to verify what happens within. That should change. Blockchains promise decentralised and trustworthy computing: programs checking up on each other’s work.
Blockchains, writes Szabo, “allow one to seamlessly and securely work across human trust boundaries (eg national borders), in contrast to ‘call-the-cop’ architectures like PayPal and Visa that continually depend on expensive, error-prone and sometimes corruptible bureaucracies to function with a reasonable amount of integrity”. Admittedly, Bitcoin cannot rival PayPal or Visa, because its emphasis on security ensures that it works slowly and uses a lot of electricity. Satoshi made “radical tradeoffs in favour of security and against performance”, as Szabo puts it.
One phrase that Szabo coined early on was “smart contracts”. This has since been taken up by many blockchains start-ups, especially the darling of the market, Ethereum. It is here that the technology shows most long-term promise. As Lord Holmes of Richmond argued in a paper published last week, the British government should be actively studying how to revolutionise its work through distributed-ledger technologies, such as blockchains.
Lord Holmes has tried to breathe new life into the recommendations last year by the government’s chief scientist, Sir Mark Walport, that “distributed-ledger technologies have the potential to help governments to collect taxes, deliver benefits, issue passports, record land registries, assure the supply chain of goods and generally ensure the integrity of government records and services”.
The Holmes report suggests that border control could work more seamlessly using a distributed ledger, shared and updated by the agencies that have an interest in the operation of the border. In the private sector there is a rash of new startups offering blockchains breakthroughs. For example, Cambridge Blockchain promises to tackle the costly and time-consuming know-your-customer regulations that entangle banks and customers in absurd and repetitive questionnaires about who they are.
How many of these ideas prove practical remains to be seen, but some probably will. If you think of blockchains as the decentralisation of the solution to the trust problem in cyberspace, you can see how far this could go. Blockchains may represent a far greater threat to the jobs of middle men — lawyers, accountants, Facebook employees, civil servants — than artificial intelligence does. And a far greater opportunity to go global even than Brexit.

That's not what a hard fork is. It is just an entry in the Revolut server database showing changing hands of crypto between users.
They don't have to buy simultaneously as a user on their system buys, for the same reason as when you buy from an exchange it isn't equivalent to a transaction on the blockchain.

The volume is a drop in the ocean at the moment, way less than the amount traded on the USD exchanges. Wait until CME opens next week which is about 5 times bigger tham CBOE still.
Also, higher futures volume means more stability, which would be good for Bitcoin long term - slow steady growth is much better than the huge daily prices swings recently, especially since there is still a scaling issue that needs to be sorted out before we reach the moon.
Lower volatility = good for bitcoin.

If you buy Bitcoin and they go into an exchange "wallet", then you don't own the private keys for that wallet and therefore you don't actually own the Bitcoin. It exists just as a number in their database.

It's all relative and a good "problem" to have. One would rather have usage and relatively high fees than no users and all speculation but low fees. In my opinion it is an absolute gamechanger for higher ticket items like houses and cars. You can buy a house online and transact the value over in a matter of minutes, think about that. Before this, you would have to rely on banks, call them up beforehand to authorise the payment and wait at least 5 working days for the money to clear, and pay even higher fees for the privilege of doing so.

im sorry if i offended you. you should do a little research before investing.
please in future dont say statements like "$100 is worth the price" because for most people, it is actually not worth the price, time, effort and resources to run a full node. it is hypocritical to say so when you dont do it yourself.

The volume for GBP on gdax is much lower than USD: 1000 vs 28,000, so any mid size trade can move the market more in comparison. Also a lot of UK traders deposit their money in Euro's not pounds to avoid conversion fees.

With some developing countries, there has been a strong emergence of centralised solutions like China for example, they have an app called WeChat which has fully featured payment integration. They pay each other using their smartphones, instantly and with zero fee. Nobody pays anybody else with anything other than WeChat Pay.
A decentralised solution has to compete and be better than that by ticking the other boxes. Simple to use, if you can use a smartphone then you should be able to use it. The fact there are many decentralised smartphone apps all competing against each other is a benefit and at the same time a hindrance as they are not all easy to use.

It may not go where you want it to though, but hey, its empty and has lots of space for people. But if that bus ever gets full, you will end up with the same problem.

What do you suggest then? How do you differentiate between legit and spam transactions?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:28:08
No, that's not how an exchange works at all. If a transaction goes through the blockchain, then there is a miner fee per transaction plus a 10 minute delay. If it goes via an entry in their database, then there is 0 cost to the exchange and the transaction is instantaneous.
When you buy Bitcoin on an exchange, nothing is added to the blockchain at all. You could be buying from many different sellers resulting in many different transactions, and the balance just shows up as a number in your account. The only transaction that occurs on the blockchain is when you withdraw it from the exchange into your Bitcoin wallet.

There is no such thing as an "actual" value. For example, if you don't have any US dollars, then you would have to buy or obtain some on a foreign currency exchange, each exchange has a slightly different value. But because the volume of transactions in Euro/GBP to USD are much larger, the differences in prices is much smaller compared to BTC to USD.

The crypto craze has hit the futures market, with Monday’s inaugural trading session crashing the exchange’s website and opening up a $2,000 gap with the underlying price in a fresh reminder of the volatile and fractured nature of the way these coins change hands.
In early trade on the CBOE Futures Exchange, the January bitcoin contract traded as high as $18,850 to the dollar, having opened around $15,000. More than 2,500 contracts had traded hands by 1:44am in Chicago (7:44am GMT), according to CBOE data. Trading was halted twice, first for two minutes then for five, after the abrupt rise triggered ‘circuit breakers’ aimed at easing excessive volatility.
Trading was light compared with more established currencies futures. For instance, volume on the December euro-dollar contract traded on the larger CME Group exchange had already reached 26,592. Still, bitcoin futures trading was more active than some market participants had expected. Intense interest caused intermittent outages on the CBOE Global Markets website but did not affect its trade systems.
The sharp rally left bitcoin futures trading significantly above prices quoted on large cash exchanges. On Coinbase, a US venue, one coin could be sold for $16,900, while on the Gemini exchange that CBOE futures settlement is based on, the price was $16,250.
The large spread between the spot and futures markets exchanges highlights the fragile market that often seizes up in times of tumult, and suffers from long execution times that makes it difficult for traders to cash in on arbitrage opportunities.
Underscoring those issues, Coinbase wrote to clients late last week, reminding them that “there may be downtime which can impact your ability to trade,” according to an email received by the Financial Times.
“Despite the sizable and ongoing increases in our technical infrastructure and engineering staff, we wanted to remind customers that access to Coinbase services may become degraded or unavailable during times of significant volatility or volume,” Coinbase wrote.
Last Thursday, the price of bitcoin on Coinbase diverged widely from other markets, shooting to $19,000 from $17,000 in a matter of minutes, before plummeting back below $16,000.
Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Wealth Management, said on Monday that the futures trading had added more fervor the the “hysteria”, but warned that bitcoin remains a “highly dangerous store of value”.
“This was a bubble at $6,000 and is a bubble at $16,000,” he said.
Some market participants reckon that increased institutional interest that might come from the launch of futures trading on the CBOE, followed next week by the launch of futures at CME Group, a larger market, will help to tame the intense volatility while others are less certain over whether the ‘Wild West’ mentality will subside.
Nasdaq, the New York exchange operator, for instance, is plotting its own bitcoin futures contract, but it is still gauging the views of industry participants as it develops its plans, according to a person familiar with the company’s thinking.

Bank verification is part of the security on the banking side. Bitcoin securely verifies transactions in 10 minutes, not 3-5 days. Those are all nuances of an archaic banking system, not a fault of Bitcoin.
It's like having to walk to a car dealership to buy a fast car. So slow! Have to walk across the road, wait for cars to stop etc.

Bitcoin has no closing price, it trades continuously 24/7, 365 days a year.


The opposite is true. The temporary withdrawal sanctions imposed stifled growth recently.


The upward trend has been going since 2015, and as recently as the last 6-9 months, not just the last month. Mtgox collapsed 2013 not 2014.

That is the exchange fee for converting from FIAT to BTC. The point is transactions between BTC to BTC are low as they avoid the FIAT system. If you are still using the FIAT system on at least one side then fees will be high and transactions will be slow.

I meant the retailer double charging you, which is impossible and cannot happen using bitcoin.
The hotel rooms and flights are basically empty seats and rooms at the end of the day and have negative cost if left empty, and have very little maintenance cost if not. Those are the 'rewards' you get for selling your consumer information, spending patterns and location of every purchase.

Another thing is trust. This happened today:  You're trusting the processing company not to double charge you, lose your transaction or never actually process your transaction, leaving you with overdraft fees, the price you pay for 'protection'. With the blockchain, information is distributed to all nodes simultaneously, you can't double spend, and once it's processed it's there for the world to see.

You don't buy a coffee with gold bullion.

I agree. The current fee spike yesterday whether artificially generated by a bad actor which is the likely case or a spike due to people wanting to bet on 'the fight' is useless for small transactions just like smelting a gold bullion into thousands of pieces so you can use one to pay for a coffee now is useless. It's a storm that requires real long term solutions and not just reactively patching it so it works now.
Remember, right now, Bitcoin is experimental. If you don't understand it fully, then you shouldn't really be using it or depending on it.

You are participating in a flawed system for 'points' and 'rewards' when actually you are the one being gamed. You're the product.

Make it inflationary instead of deflationary. Every so often exponentially increase the total amount in circulation or at least at a rate that keeps the value down or constant. Allow people to create more of the currency at will. Use negative interest rates i.e. charge people for holding - a bit like the current banking system.

Another thing I would add is it is the same fee to transfer 1 million bitcoins or $5 in bitcoins. The same cannot be said at all for wire transfers, assuming it is even possible by your bank and not flagged. Even if it is a small percentage like 1% that is $10,000 USD in fees. Suddenly, the $5 to transfer it using bitcoin is not so bad.
@_date: 2017-08-06 21:56:01
Part of the problem is having a set name that one can relate to everyday items that it can be priced relative to, not so much just relative to other fiat currencies. One of the goals of fiat of course is to control inflation at a steady rate, so that good and services cost relatively the same amount or slightly more each year.
With BTC, it is almost like hyperdeflation, the opposite of hyperinflation during the 2nd world war, where Germans were using wheelbarrows of money to pay for items. The uncontrolled rapid price increase and volatility of BTC relative to other currencies and also good and services means that giving a long term price to specific things like a pizza or a coffee in a shop doesn't make sense. It makes more sense to hold, because it will be worth more tomorrow. Arbritrarily using units such as millibits as well as bitcoins doesnt solve anything.

Nothing, but think about it. You sell BTC for INR. Can you convert the INR back to USD/FIAT/BTC easily (without losing on conversion rates  and fees)? (so you can rebuy BTC). The likely answer is no, so you'll be stuck with a lot of INR.

Invest as a way of diversfying your portfolio to reduce risk of other assets, not as a get rich quick scheme. Same can be said of stocks, 20 years ago you could buy Apple stocks for cheap, "way too late to put money in now". Bitcoin has more potential upside right now, stocks on the whole seem inflated. On the mining front don't bother. If you're waiting a long time for a return, you could have put all your money into btc instead of hardware.

No, that's not how it works. One order does not force a business to sell for FIAT. I assume that the majority of their business is in FIAT already. When the majority of business is in Bitcoin, then so will bill payments, they will be widespread too. Note that you can already pay bills in Bitcoin.

Both Bitpay and Coinbase have a small markup over the spot price when you transact in and out of it, that's how they make money. As well as that, there is a miner's fee in Bitcoin for adding a transaction onto the blockchain. The exact amount in dollars depends on the current trading price as well as the number of pending transactions on the mempool.
Steam on the other hand does not add a fee, but depending on your country, there may be additional taxes like sales tax or VAT.

I agree, there's no reason to put millions of coffee transactions on chain per day which neither 1MB or 8MB blocks would be able to handle when it is possible to leverage the current payment network for micro transactions. Currently the other altcoin are not even using it for anything, let alone cups of coffee as there's only double digit number of transactions per block.

The point where it will be too late is when the average person is using Bitcoin like they are using wifi on their phone, or invested in some as part of a diversified portfolio or retirement scheme without realising it or needing to care about the price of it all the time.
After the fork, it is likely to go even higher, my theory is people adopting one chain over the other leads to dumping of the weaker one increasing demand of the stronger one, therefore the price can only go up. That's what happened with bcash, people got a free ~10% bonus if they sold it and put it in Bitcoin.

In my opinion the alt-coin is all about short term quick fixes, if they were really prepared they could have foreseen the need to code measures in the EDA instead of hard forking unecessarily. This shows a lack of co-ordination, not the presence of. Continuous hard forking is the last thing you want to do with a decentralised system, even if there consensus.
Timing the peak of a pump and dump is basically impossible unless you're the one orchestrating it. There are unforeseen delays, restrictions whilst you try and get your money in and out. The volume is low at the peak before it crashes again. Don't try to time the market to make quick profits unless you have experience and a lot of luck. A lot of people were duped in trying to do the same thing and lost even more than you:

	Q: How does this work?
	A: Private keys are a number. 
	   Private keys can be very large numbers.
	   Private keys can be very small numbers.
	   A private key with the value   0 would generate the address: 16QaFeudRUt8NYy2yzjm3BMvG4xBbAsBFM
	   A private key with the value   1 would generate the address: 1EHNa6Q4Jz2uvNExL497mE43ikXhwF6kZm
	   A private key with the value   2 would generate the address: 1LagHJk2FyCV2VzrNHVqg3gYG4TSYwDV4m
	   A private key with the value 127 would generate the address: 1FB8cZijTpRQp3HX8AEkNuQJBqApqfTcX7
	   For every page requested, 128 keys are generated.
	   For page 1, private keys with the value   0 to 127 are generated.

Unnecessarily complicates the system for which there is no need to give miners this extra reward. The lost coins benefit the holders as it increases their value slightly. Changing the protocol midway requires hard fork and informing every holder of coins. No way to define whether a coin is “lost” or put into long term storage.

It's a bit like when you're playing football/soccer on the school playground/yard, and somebody throws a tennis ball in. Someone starts kicking it around in the corner for a while and celebrates a bit when they score. Then, eventually more people start kicking around until half the playground/yard is playing with it. And then it is lost in a gap in the fence, and everyone starts playing with the real soccer/football again.

That’s right, computers are deterministic and the task is to generate a number as random as possible using code. A solution is to take external data like temp, camera or microphone sensors or user input like mouse movements. If generating seeds extra care must be taken to ensure the seed is actually random, and running the seed generating algorithm many times is not the way to do this.

A traditional stock split doubling the total number of coins whilst halving the price would never happen as achieving consensus would be impossible. If such a coin were to fork then nobody would use it.

Where you pay tax and what you pay it on depends where you are resident for taxation purposes. Unless you are a permanent resident of the seas, i.e. a pirate, then you would pay tax in your home country and it would be declared as foreign income.

As I write, Bitcoin is trading at a new high of £6,305. If you had bought one Bitcoin in September, you could by now have made £3,860.
The relentless rise of Bitcoin - a digital currency that can be used to store and save money privately, without the need for banks or names - has defied all expectations. Some have even wondered if the financial experts who have called it 'a fraud' were being deliberately disparaging to protect their own interests.
Bitcoin has given good return to investors, but make no mistake: this is not a bonafide currency, and those who buy it are taking a mighty roll of the dice. 
Sweden has put serious thought into launching its own digital currency; China’s central bank is actually testing a prototype
For a start, its value fluctuates widely. The current rally comes on the back of a steep fall last week that saw prices fall to $5,500. So, in a single week, its value increased by 47 percent. If your savings were in Bitcoin, you would go to bed not knowing if you'll be able to afford a Bugatti or just a baguette the next day. The constant fluctuations also mean Bitcoin cannot be used to price goods. And it is worthless as a medium of exchange as hardly anyone accepts it and even when they do, it costs up to $12 per transaction and can take hours to clear. 
So, hype aside, Bitcoins are lottery tickets. They have no underlying utility. When the music stops, those left holding them will be burned.
One potential remedy is for central banks to issue their own digital tokens, to show what a real e-currency should look like. A BitPound would have the same value as cash and be backed by the Bank of England, making it stable and universally accepted. Sweden has put serious thought into launching its own digital currency; China’s central bank is actually testing a prototype. 
So what could it do for us? Our economies are moving from cash to digital transactions -  cards now account for more than half of all payments in the UK, and online payments for more than one in ten. An e-Pound could make these payment systems fairer - because private payment providers wouldn't be able to exploit their market dominance and charge extortionate fees - and better protected from cyber attacks.
With BitPound deposits, there would be no threat of savings vanishing if banks collapse because consumers would have a direct claim on the central bank itself
An e-Pound would also help the UK fight fraud. Transactions would be linked to accounts at the BoE and so there would be a clear trail of all transactions from the moment a new currency is created. Some have even suggested making e-currencies trackable. While this does raise privacy concerns, it would stop everything from minors buying alcohol to money laundering and tax evasion.
Finally, BitPound deposits would be a secure way to save. There would be no threat of savings vanishing if banks collapse because consumers would have a direct claim on the central bank itself. 
The problem is that creating this direct link between consumers and the Bank of England could deprive banks of the deposits they use to create loans. Banks, then, would have to redesign their operating models by, say, offering higher savings rates or the BoE would have to recompense them with the proceeds paid back to the public purse.
There are risks and unanswered questions, but it's time to think seriously about a BitPound - to expose private cryptocurrencies for the wild gamble they are, and make an increasingly digital payment system safe and robust.

Yes, that would work. If the trezor is destroyed (e.g. with a hammer - not lost) then you can use the same seed to restore.
Restoring the same seed on 2 different trezors would show the same amount on each, but that does not mean you have 2x the number of Bitcoins. When you spend/receive from one device, the same transaction will show up on the other one next time you plug it in.

In most of UK, the fee is built into the cost of the item, except for rare cases like buying tickets online on some websites for example.
The card machine is a cost for the business, in theory the extra transactions should outweigh the costs of the fees to use the machine.

You could either send funds to a third party in advance, but then you would have to trust them.
Another way it could be done is where you hold the funds and at the start of each payment period you click a button to authorise the transaction, e.g. in a invoice reminder by email. But every small action is friction, it depends on your action, which for most subscriptions like gym or iTunes or Netflix, it depends somewhat on you forgetting you have the membership in the first place and the company makes money by taking it automatically.
I think the key to this, is how can you implement this in such a way where it is trustless (you keep hold of the funds), and at the same time there is minimal friction, ideally zero and completely automated (if the user does nothing it is assumed they authorised the payment), the same as a credit card. Maybe like a [dead mans switch]( with a time locked transaction?
In either case it would have to be more beneficial to the user than the savings from e.g. paying a year in advance. For the business, maybe it only would be worth it if they are losing customers from a high monthly cost where users cannot afford a yearly payment in advance.

a fork is completely different to a split. the price is not fixed and can go up or down after the fork. with a traditional 2-1 stock split, the shares are doubled and the price halves. with bitcoin, noone controls the price on the exchange, so this wont happen.
you will have whatever you have in bitcoin, but also the same amount in b2x coins. if you sold it all on the exchange for usd, then nothing will change, you still have the same amount of usd.

There isn't really any good provider at the moment, you should wait until there is more competition and users which would drive down the costs and then the savings would eventually be passed down to the consumer. All of them have fees in some form or another or it wouldn't be a practical business model, the expectation for them to be free is because the transaction costs in VISA are hidden inside the cost of the item so you don't notice it, in reality it costs a couple percent for every transaction plus a fixed cost, e.g. Stripe is 2.9% and 30 cents.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:39:51
In my opinion, it seems like there was an upward pressure of people expecting to sell free coins after the fork, which would lead to the further price rise of one of the forks, juxtaposed by huge uncertainty about the fork itself - of being able to be attacked and controlled by a small number of people with huge resources. The result is something that is on the whole, a community vote, decided by the community and it shows the power of the community and something that will lead to Bitcoin being stronger going forward, now that this speed hump is out of the way.
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:57:02
I don't understand why people are so negative. The way the blog post reads implies that they will gradually roll it out in steps compared to just giving users everything, the latter which may lead to bugs and instability in their systems if not given enough testing.
So, if you do have access, go ahead and buy some, show there is some usage and they will be more inclined to roll out other parts like paying with crypto and withdrawing/depositing faster.

a company that has ownership over lots of addresses with small amounts of bitcoin (lets say a small exchange, or a crypto-poker site for example), wants to move all those bitcoins to a single address. since there isn't enough in each address to be worth spending a high fee, they throw out a hail mary and bulk send them on low fees. Maybe they know there's little chance any will go through, but they need the money badly so why not try? they're not doing any good otherwise.
Again thats only one possibility, I have no idea what the internal financials of any crypto business look like because they're not publicly available. maybe a database of a bunch of low value "tip" addresses got hacked and someone was just trying to get them out as quickly as possible before anyone noticed. maybe the government seized a bunch of addresses and set an arbitrary threshold that any address under X amount could only be sent with X fee and the guy who got paid to transfer them wasn't getting paid to give a shit whether they went through or not.


I have no idea what those transactions were because the blockchain is pseudonymous. 


the graph is evidence the transactions happened.spam implies malicious intent to overload the network.  if you don't think you need additional evidence for additional claims I don't know what to tell you. Are you saying its literally impossible to make that number of transactions for any other reason other than malicious spamming of the network? 


literally any additional evidence other than just pointing out the fact the transactions happened and saying "it looks like spam to me".

What? Not sure if something got lost in translation there.
I meant the current exchange value/rate of BTC to USD.
The fact that people keep referring to bitcoin as a dollar amount, e.g. bitcoin is x USD, &amp; "you can buy bitcoins", just shows how long a way it is to go from being thought of as a get rich quick scheme than a currency. I don't hear many people saying "you can buy Euro's in fractions, you can buy USD in cents. Buy USD now, there was a dip yesterday".
@_date: 2017-09-24 22:17:53

@_date: 2017-09-18 23:50:14
its an interesting game theory based problem of delayed gratification and market forces interacting. as further halvenings occur the fees would become a bigger proportion of the total reward so i'd assume the situation would get better in the far future. more miners/ decentralisation would help, e.g. if every node was a miner then there would be more incentive to fill up as thre is a smaller chance of mining a single block.

Both speed and fees are relative in comparison to their former alternative, **Bitcoin is already used as a currency** for purchasing anything from coffee to houses, and in the latter the fees are relatively low and the transaction is fast:
"In all of my 33 years of closing transactions, I honestly couldn’t have expected something so unique to go so smoothly,” Kuper Sotheby’s Sheryl Lowe, the buyer’s agent, said in a press release. “In a matter of 10 minutes, the bitcoin was changed to U.S. dollars and the deal was done!"

I see a positive future for crypto. Banks are slowly realising that they should start investing some serious resources in this area. There are many services each day that make integration of transactions between the banking world and bitcoin so much easier. e.g. [Revolut]( cryptopay.me debit cards, purse.io, copay, etc. These services are a stepping stone that could eventually cause the majority of transactions to be conducted electronically and via the blockchain or similar networks, which would mean that other forms of money less liked by governments like cash are slowly phased out.

People with no integrity accept money and make changes like these and see if anybody notices them, if they do they call it a "mistake" and change it back. If they go unnoticed, the "Bitcoin Cash" (Bcash) scam grows deeper. Glad there is a strong community here that can call out these "mistakes".
As long as Roger Ver has money, these "mistakes" will continue to happen for other companies too.

Every bitcoin comes from somewhere, that place is the block from which it is mined on the blockchain. The miners who mine the blocks sell them on the exchanges. Localbitcoins traders buy from the exchanges to sell them on OTC for a premium, that is how they make a profit. Every 10 minutes 12.5 * 3700 ~ $46,000 USD, or $6.6 million USD/day of bitcoin are created. As a rough example, Coinbase has about 33,000 new users a day, every one of them would have to buy $200 to keep the price constant.

It is inevitable that crypto will be more widely used in the future, whether it is bitcoin, government backed or another alt-coin, much like how we moved from horse carriages to cars, or from fossil fuels towards electric. With ICO's I think there is a bit of an investment 'bubble' - its a bit like the wild west, there are a lot of unregulated activities although I don't really consider them to be "cryptocurrencies", once governments start regulating crypto e.g. like China, it should be safer to use and more people will use it.

Do you really think this will happen though? What economic incentive is there for merchants to drive this change? I think you misunderstand the retail sector. A companys' goal is to make money in the fastest and most convenient way possible, so they will stick to cash and card.

e.g. link above - 25,000 linearly added transactions to the mempopol over the course of several hours.
what could it be?
a) It could be 25,000 real people all wanting to transact on that day, all deciding to do so at the same point in time on that day and saying, im going to send a low fee tx at exactly x time, you send it 1 second after, then you keep going at specifically regular intervals. i dont want my tx confirmed so i make it low fee and also it has to look like a linear line graph over the course of that day.
b) spam transactions made by bots.

Bitpay/Coinbase take 1%+ commision, it's interesting that they provide a worse user experience instead of subsuming the cost. That's what happens when there's little competition.
Not so much a problem now when 1-2 sat/byte transactions are confirming, but it was last December. Volatility and payments should be completely solved in Lightning as transactions are instanenous, no waiting for 10 minutes or more confirmation time. User doesn't need to worry about their fee being too low or high or getting stuck in the mempool, it will either go through instantly or it won't.

    It could be 25,000 real people all wanting to transact on that day, all deciding to do so at the same point in time on that day and saying, im going to send a low fee tx at exactly x time, you send it 1 second after, then you keep going at specifically regular intervals. i dont want my tx confirmed so i make it low fee and also it has to look like a linear line graph over the course of that day.
Or 1 company with 25,000 dust addresses trying to consolidate them before the market shits out or fees climb any higher?


Or 1 bot programmed to move bitcoin out of those addresses once it hits some kind of price threshold.
    the same thing happened on the bcash chain
if its the same person/company/bot consolidating both sets of dust why wouldn't they do it at the same time?

@_date: 2018-02-15 15:44:04
    you would expect a company or person to make financial decisions in their best interest and stop doing things that waste time and their money.
And I just provided examples of big companies making dumb financial decisions like not batching transactions and paying far too much for transactions so its clearly possible. "people wouldn't waste time or money" is not a good argument when the market is full of people doing both.


    thats just an idea not a proof that it is impossible for an advantage to be gained.
And I'm not saying its impossible that it is malicious spam, just that there's no definitive proof that it is.


The fact that such "spam" does little to effect the network is just a small piece of evidence to weigh against others.
Spamming with low fee transactions when fees are already high does nothing to slow down the network because those fees aren't getting included in any blocks, they just get stuck in mempool til either they disappear or traffic dies down and they go through.

The seed words are uniquely determined from their first four characters. Using the first 2 or 3 letters and writing the length is just a recipe to confuse yourself even more, as you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between words like absent and absorb, and some word lists use different words keeping the first 4 characters.

It's a predictable event that will be "priced in" months before it happens. Don't expect any sudden price movements outside the usual high volatility.

Put simply, it is downloading the entire blockchain, in total it is currently 148 GB, and keeping connected to other nodes. The blockchain contains every single transaction ever made on the bitcoin network. You download blocks from other nodes in a peer to peer network, and peers can download from you, hence keeping an extra copy of the ledger. The more people that keep a full node running and online makes the entire system more robust.

Well I guess you could let it out instead of living there, but the same irony applies, getting back the principal is like betting bitcoin won't go up in 10 years time.

@_date: 2017-10-20 21:19:00
you cant buy directly from yourself. you would just fill the lowest current market orders first.
so for example in order to buy at 10% higher you would have to buy all the bitcoins selling between the current price and 10% higher. so e.g. for bitfinex, 6,773.34 btc worth or about $40 million dollars to make the price jump up 10%.

on the left is bids, people wanting to buy at a specific price. on the right asks, or sell orders people wanting to sell at a specific price.
price is the price the order was set. total is the cumulative count of each column in bitcoin, amount is the individual order amount, count is the number of orders at that specific price.
e.g. you want to buy bitcoin, either put a buy limit order which will go on the left column. and you wait for someone to fulfil your order.
or, you want to buy bitcoin **now**, then put in a market order and you would instantly buy at the prices on the right column.
similarly for sells, swap sell and buy in the previous sentences.
the spread is the difference between the highest bid and lowest ask.

This is fake news/press release, specifically on the website it states they had: "150 off-plan apartments starting at 9BTC*" and now they have "132 Apartments available". So they only sold 18. They also had a prize draw around September last year if they sold more than 50 apartments, but it got retracted and removed from the site since they sold less than 10.
The Bitcoin apartments are all in the 2nd of two towers which is the south tower and less desirable as it likely is more occluded by the first tower.
The towers are not expected to be completed until Summer 2019.
They use Bitpay which converts everything to USD, they dont keep the Bitcoin.
No updates to the construction gallery since september 2017  No guarantee of quality of build, timeliness of completion, utility rates, maintenance charges, refund if things go wrong.
Really super risky "investment" that you would only break even in ~10 years. Youre basically selling your bitcoin expecting that in 10 years time, bitcoin would not double in that time. And that the letting market is going to stay increasing/active there over that time.

From my understanding, if banks lose too much money - they get bailed out. The government controls new money that is issued and controls interest rates and their goal is to maintain steady growth. Assets and alternative investments exists alongside FIAT.
An investors best strategy will never be go "all in" on gold or bitcoin or red/black - just too risky. They will diversify to spread risk. If ordinary people save too much, then lower interest rates, and your money becomes worth less. Then it becomes more worthwhile to spend on stocks and shares. If government want to reign that in, then raise interest rates. The government have the control here. Banks will not suddenly move to using crytpocurrencies for all transactions again due to the risk. They have their own ledger they can control fully, why use a chain they can't modify at their will.

I think there will always be a dependency for people to use FIAT, whether it is natural or forced. e.g. the government contracts the build of new houses, they could only accept FIAT based mortgages. Banks and government will always have a choice. One could run away and go off-grid, but when that would become a choice for the majority of people, the country is ruined and the government is no longer in control of it's people.
