Miners aren't impacted by fees. In your system nothing would stop me from making 1 GB blocks and fragmenting the network as everybody tried to keep up with the tightly peered pools. They would survive it, most nodes in the network would churn or die. With even just 100GB of packed blocks you could fill a good number of nodes disks instantly.

That doesn't solve anything either. Transactions don't have to be broadcast in order to be put into a block. There's little risk of other people taking the fees unless they fork around my block and attempt to remine them.

No, only BFGminer does that sort of checking. cgminer does not, and cgminer is what powers most consumer miners.

Did the non naive miners stop mining at ghash.io when they used their hashpower to do millions of dollars worth of finney attacks? Nope.

They aren't all the same length so I think these are encrypted not hashed, possibly just obfuscated in a stupid way". Numbers are always in the first column, so could be just ASCII strings shifted down or XORed, but I can't explain the trailing character. Are the rest of varied lengths, all odd number of chars?

Yeah that confirms it. I'm not going give any information as to how because that just needlessly helps the hacker, but whoever made this is an idiot and should not be running an exchange.

No. If anything it makes them easier, P2Pool itself is vulnerable to a majority hashrate inside it's own blockchain. If you have 60% of the P2Pool hashpower you can extend that to having 100% of the income as well.

No, just run a server. It logs every block how long it took. It's two solid minutes of disk scratching for your average sized block. Catching up with the chain if you fall behind is almost impossible.

Miners can include whatever they want in a block without any fees at all, absent some sort of cap on the size they can fill them with whatever they want to. You might not be able to spam the hell out of the network, but I and other miners can with ease.

No, Electrum can not scale. It's server already takes upwards of 2 minutes to process a new block. 


It subscribes, it doesn't poll.

Making a 1MB block isn't anywhere near as funny or interesting as a 1000MB block.
