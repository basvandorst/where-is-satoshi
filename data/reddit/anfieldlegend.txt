Sorry. I'm dense. Can you give me the syntax to forward the 0.23 in my wallet to the ru4mepet rescue charity in your post?

Thank you.

This right here. Some of you should consider spending some time working with addicts and observing their abilities to make rational decisions. Spend some time with the families of these addicts and see whether they agree with your views. Spend some time with grieving families who have lost loved ones at the hands of addicts driven to violence. Everyone makes that first call to shoot up, and that decision is theirs alone. But, there comes a point where the decision to use further, and a host of knock-on consequences become outside their control. You might change your thoughts somewhat if you had some exposure to the things addicts are capable of, not necessarily because they are bad people, but because they are addicts. Enabling or furthering the ability for people to feed an addiction has real world consequences that need to be considered, despite one's libertarian views.

Thanks as always for doing this.  Happily supporting animals with my donations. Just need to convince more to get on board with accepting Bitcoin.

I tried to sign up and keep getting an "error in processing". Not sure if this is related to area code, but doesn't work regardless.

If so, I agree that this is a huge issue. People lose phones all the time, this is a fact of life. I'd rather not lose all my money in the process as well.

Agreed. At the moment though, convincing anyone I know to even consider trying to understand, let alone use Bitcoin, is the primary challenge.

I see your point, but in my experiences with eBay, it's the damn shipping that's the real killer.

Great username. Thanks for doing this.
