Yeah that would piss me off. But hopefully it goes through soon!

I've paid over £10 for my most recent transaction. Still nothing after 24h. I've got quite a few unconfirmed TX's, and most of them paid with a ridiculously high fee. Yes, I'm talking about it and I've made a post about it here in this sub.

I feel like BTC is suffering from a little bit of "culture lag," even if it's within the limited context of the cryptocurrency culture.

Grim as fuck. However, BTC's my first love. Through thick and through thin. I suspect we'll make it through this rough patch - I'm just having a bit of a moan about it while it's here!
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:07:34
I know.
So what?
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:52:10
Not sure. I've slept and woken up - still nothing. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:48:36
I don't know. Man, just let me have my little shred of optimism! Without being able to move my BTC it's all I have left!!

I paid almost £11 for this transaction. The two before that, I paid only a little bit less. And seeing as my first unconfirmed transaction was over 24 hours ago despite being paid with the highest fee according to the Ledger Nano S, I feel I'm well-grounded to have a fucking moan about it.

Yes, i'm trying to use it as a currency. But the blockchain doesn't discriminate. Whether I'm bouncing money around or actually paying for tangible goods and services, what difference does it make? Those miners don't give a fuck about what I'm doing with it. But I DO. And I've had a mix of transactions not go through lately, and it's fucking pissing me off. What do you want me to say man? You want me to say something about how I'm using Bitcoin the "wrong way" and thus it isn't being confirmed? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:00:16
I personally wouldn't go that far. I just feel the need for something to change right now, and it just so happens that this hits at a time when I'm trying to make some important transactions.

Sorry that I trusted BTC as a currency. I never did think that "my sort of behaviour" would cause much of a problem. Under 10 transactions over the past 24-32 hours? My behaviour is causing these problems? Get the fuck out of here.

Mine all confirmed last night at the same time. I also sent other transactions with regular fees which, surprisingly, confirmed in about 10 minutes.

How is it a store of value? Even if I wanted to sell it off (which I don't) I can't.

Like I said, the corner shops and supermarkets near me stock hot sauces that are no longer hot enough! Plus, I want to try a bunch of different kinds, different flavours, etc.

Thanks. I've just e-mailed them to ask about international delivery. Much appreciated!
