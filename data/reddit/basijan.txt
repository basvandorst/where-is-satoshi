Are you really that uninformed that you think that bitoin is some sort of unchangable system which can never have issues ironed out? 
Even if it was, the other coins which also use blockchain will eventually solve all the issues you mentioned.
Once that is in place its pretty easy to see how it would undermine the banking industry, ie it creates a trustless mechanism for transferring wealth and who knows what else?

What a weird comment

It's not about "each to their own" though, its about you making a statment based on your gfs dogs even though there are tons of people who have experienced the opposite. Its more to do with you chattin shit

He may be right, but as the other commenter said, no one knows for sure, yet OP is allowed to have an opinion, which in this case is him thinking that the analysis makes sense.
Your bullshit point makes you sound like a sour no-coiner, and I don't even own bitcoin

What a great analysis of stranger's ability to think based on a single comment with nothing to back it up.
Also you sound like a dick

Something being in the whitepaper and fundamental doesn't mean its not optional
