Most likely there already is one. Search at meetup.com site (or app). Community needs to be proactive, set up site and have business cards printed for members to get small businesses, friends, and other groups on board.

We don't actually need Andreas. The reason is that Bitcoin decentralized ledger and protocol is already invented and works. Therefore, change in our society is eminent. Andreas remind us of a vision, but what we need are small steps toward the vision. We need doers, not idealists. Doers who will find their way through cartels and governments (not fight them), and create services leading toward mass adaptation. Btw, there are two segments on real time show with Bill Maher where Andreas or any other author concerning Bitcoin could talk about it. Usually Bill gives them about 3 minutes and after that they may receive few additional questions depending on segment. Bill Maher is Ok, but leaning (read: large donation to Obama) toward democrats rather then liberals during the last few years.

Primary focus could be toward Google integrating Bitcoin in to Google wallet service &amp; Gmail money transactions. This could boost both, Google wallet and Bitcoin adoption rate.

$2,700 here. The information provided on bitfloor site is insufficient to say the least. Therefore, we need to hire good legal representation to approach bf owner/s for proper info and possible action.
