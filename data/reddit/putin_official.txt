BitFlyer user here. They do have a fee (.15% for smaller trades, and .1% for larger ones iirc), but in the past few weeks they’ve done away with the fee as part of a marketing campaign.

Notice how he didn’t acknowledge any of the other points about B-cash, and is just making stuff up now to rile you up. He’s a troll, don’t feed him

Can I ask which trendline you're using?
As it stands, we're about 40% below the trendline going back to 2010 (at .3917% compounded daily, we should be at $11,020 today). That said, I do agree with your larger point; in terms of dips this is pretty consistent with previous years, and there isn't really anything to suggest Bitcoin will lose dominance anytime soon.

5800 would be almost 50% less than the logarithmic trend going back to 2010 (according to my math, at a daily compounding rate of .3917%, today's expected price would be $11,020), and in its history BTC has only dropped below that 3 times. We're currently about 40% below the trend now, so I would say that already qualifies as a dip.

Unfortunately, the mempool tends to get plugged up a lot just after a big drop (like the one we just had) as people try and move their coins from cold storage to sell on exchanges. I would expect this to clear up in the next 24 hours as the panic-sellers lose momentum and the price stabilizes.
Now, to answer your question, I would expect it to take about 6 hours at the most (at least, that's been my experience sending low-fee transactions during times like this).

Interesting, thanks for that. Yeah, that makes sense, perhaps some sort of weighted average equation would be best (accounting more for results of recent years).

Usually on exchanges (like Coinbase for the U.S., or if you're like me, Bitflyer for Japan). The [Wiki in the sidebar] ( is how I figured out how it all works.
Assuming you're a beginner to all of this, I'd also recommend if you have other questions. Good luck!

I'm afraid that Bitcoin will never quite become mainstream like we all hope, because issues like hard forks and security measures will always seem like too much trouble and require too much research/knowledge for the average person compared to fiat.
I'm also afraid that even with the adoption of Segwit, transaction fees will always be too high for Bitcoin to really rival fiat as a currency for everyday purchases.

Quick question (sorry if this is kind of a noob question), but I've been running a v. 0.14.2 node for a while now (with port 8333 open). Is it worth it to update to 0.15.1? Or is it no big deal?

I see, yeah I've been wondering about how to cut out the S2X nodes, so that alone makes it worth it to me. Thanks!

Interesting, thanks for the reply and the insight. I looked into it and it doesn't seem too difficult to upgrade (should take &lt;1 hour), and if it means the possibility of performance upgrades like you say, then that's totally worth it to me. Thanks again!
