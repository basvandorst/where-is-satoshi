Not a clue.

Currently I'm poor with no spare cash for bitcoin, however in October next year I will start a new job with pay that will allow me to save.
My question: do you think I will have missed the bitcoin boat (rocket ship!) by then?
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:10:04
Yesterday is always the best time to buy and today is always the second best. Buy what you can afford to lose, whenever you can afford it. Don't stress about day to day values.

How low are we going here?

I want to get BTC from coinbase to to another exchange.
After I transfer to GDAX is it worth converting the BTC to another currency, eg LTC before making the transfer?
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:56:47
Find out who teaches econometrics and ask them.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:51:19
It won't, because you will have bitcoin not USD. Your imports will still cost the same in BTC after the USD has lost value.

This is the meme we need to rescue bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:58:47
Ah ok, got it.
I used to work in China and was given the option of my contract being in GBP or RMB, I chose RMB and ended up "quids in".
It can work out either way, just depends which you think is more likely to increase in value.
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:46:55
My sympathies to you and your family.
The sooner the world somehow finds a way to get rid of all currency, bitcoin included, the better.
Money brings out the absolute worst in people, be it greed, crime or even suicide.

Hide all your bitcoin then divorce her.

This is news from China, right?
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:00:37
I'll probably just hodl now, I might start drip feed buying small amounts each month. I'm currently saving for a house deposit so can't afford to risk too much atm.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:48:25
Hodl since Feb 2014
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:52:22


Did he pay with bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:16:44
So I just managed to locate some btc that I bought on a Chinese exchange back in FEB 2014, time to celebrate!!
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:53:20
Unless he donates his left nut to charity.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:35:33
Hodl strong and long my friend.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:34:56
Not a fortune, but a nice surprise! I only bought them as it was the easiest way to pay for my VPN subscription at the time XD
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:17:10
time to buy?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:03:42
Cheers mate, good luck to you too!
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:49:23
Do you work (if so, how do you get paid), or do you just live off your bitcoin fortune?
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:04:30
It might go down, it might go up. Buy what you can afford to lose completely then hodl long term.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:39:53
You got lucky.

I've lived in China for the past 5 years. One thing I've noticed is that when China "bans" something, it's usually only banned on paper and is allowed to go ahead in practice. They will often then slowly increase the legitimacy of the ban over time.
@_date: 2017-10-11 23:24:21
Haha, pretty much exactly what I was typing as you posted!

I get the same kind of emails, except they're from Nigeria.
@_date: 2017-05-08 07:26:20
I think they are, but for some reason they're mostly looking to the right wing for alternatives: UKIP, Trump, Le Pen, instead of Sanders, Melenchon, Corbyn (I'm actually not a Corbyn fan and wish there was a more viable alternative here in the UK).

Ross William Ulbricht (born March 27, 1984) is a former darknet market operator, best known for being convicted of creating and running the Silk Road website until his arrest. He was known under the pseudonym"Dread Pirate Roberts".
Ulbricht was convicted of money laundering,computer hacking, conspiracy to traffic fraudulent identity documents, and conspiracy to traffic narcotics in February 2015. He is currently serving a life sentencewithout the possibility of parole.
Silk Road was an online black market and the first modern darknet market, best known as a platform for selling illegal drugs. As part of the dark web, it was operated as a Tor hidden service, such that online users were able to browse it anonymously and securely without potential traffic monitoring.
Ulbricht was indicted on charges of money laundering, computer hacking, conspiracy to traffic narcotics, and attempting to have six people killed. Prosecutors alleged that Ulbricht paid $730,000 to others to commit the murders, although none of the murders actually occurred. Ulbricht ultimately was not prosecuted for any of the alleged murder attempts.
