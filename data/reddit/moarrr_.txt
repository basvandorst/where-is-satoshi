You dont explain very well how people can help you, is there a bitcoin donation address or a mailing address to send phones/resources/etc... You should put up a website or wiki or wordpress, and explain what will be done.

Tell them about my project:  - They will win a heck of a lot more than these faucets...

If there is financial collapse and the majority gets screwed, then who will run the internet, electricity grid, and general government and social functions  and other infrastructure required to allow bitcoin to work?

Lol, I would probably sell all my bitcoins if it became used by sex workers to any significant degree... Urgh...

I dont agree that children are a bad investment, although many other things are... Good on you for being so ambitious and adventurous...

The truth about bitcoin is that... Bitcoin will never work, at least in the long term. Its almost an impossibility, although a lot of people may make or lose lots of money in the mean time. Its still an interesting technology though, I would love to see it put to use for something useful :)

I recommend trying kipochi or m-pesa or something like that, there arent likely to be any/many bitcoin exchanges or traders in africa atm... perhaps you can encourage more people to do that...
