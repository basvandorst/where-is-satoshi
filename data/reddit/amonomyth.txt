Assuming by "inflate" you mean "continue to rise in price", no it's not. 
Hoarding is completely harmless. The price of goods will just fall with less money chasing after them. Savings is beneficial as it increases the capital stock to support future production.

Processing transactions to support an instant, electronic global economy is SO wasteful.

1) Lol. It will not all disappear. There are people with millions of dollars worth who take very good care of their wallets and more is being created indefinitely (in increasingly small amounts) so that is not possible. When a coin is lost all other bitcoins go up in value by a little bit, making goods/services cheaper for everyone. The only damage is the the foolish person who lost the coins.
2) The issue is avoiding attaching your identity to a bitcoin address. The network verifies that the *address* has bitcoins but they don't know who controls the address. There are many ways to avoid linking your identity and address and more under development. It's really not hard and things like zerocoin will make it even easier.
3) You obviously don't understand the protocol. When a block is made, it attaches transactions to the blockchain, verifying that they happened. The reward for finding a block is 25 bitcoin currently. That's how they are initially released into the network.
4) Yes it is. They spent their computing resources on it. Electricity isnt free. Admittedly this is a small risk, but the chance at reward was very high at that stage. Hindsight is 20/20. Now thanks to those people mining bitcoins initially there is a flourishing economy based on them so everyone else is benefitting from their initial risk.
I'm done responding to these now that it's turned into a basic bitcoin economics FAQ. Check the wiki if you want to learn anything else.

You are just listing features. That you call them fundamental flaws is a matter of perspective.
1) As they become more valuable, people will be more careful about losing them. The result of losing them is just monetary deflation anyway. Not a bad thing that everyone else's money becomes more value.
2) The blockchain is a necessity to distribute the ledger of all transactions publicly. Not all transactions require anonymity and full anonymity is trivial to execute in reality. See mixing services, in-person transactions, etc.
3) Initial distribution is tied to processing transactions. Creating blocks is a invaluable service.
4) Speculation is a value added service. A speculator assumes risk in order to profit so that others don't have to, promoting the public good. An analogy would be a person who buys a load of rice in a time of plenty to sell for more during a famine. In his selfish interest of making money, he has increased supply to people who need it.

These "liquidity crunches" are caused by having interest rates suppressed so much that no one will lend. You can't print bitcoins to supress the natural interest rate which will result in a more natural business cycle. Sure there can still be temporal liquidity demand but the market will respond to alleviate the pressure naturally.

The "paradox of thrift" is simply not valid and there is no reason nor historical evidence to suggest that liquid and valuable assets cannot be one in the same.

Yes except for the fact that everyone was bailing into treasuries because of failing subprime mortgages which were fueled by the federal funds target rate being lowered from 6.5 to 1% from 2001-2004 and subsequently raised back to 5.25%. 
[Liquidity]( was not an issue.
The asset deflation occured as a direct result of monetary policy expansion and contraction.
As for bitcoins, many see them as a safer asset than dollars due to their inability to be counterfitted en masse. More likely that they rise on any economic instability than fall. See the USD/BTC rate growth during the Cyprus crisis earlier this year.
