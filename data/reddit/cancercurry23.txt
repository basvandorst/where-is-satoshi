You’re not very smart are you?
Let me spell it out, if it’s possible to ban bitcoin in one country because of centralised internet access then it’s also possible to ban it in any other country with centralised internet access, which is the majority of the world.

Look at the daily volume, it’s incredibly low compared to traditional markets, makes it easier to manipulate, but this is all just guesses nobody can be sure.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:31:39
Owned and controlled by an ISP, or in some countries your government.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:32:22
He might be planning to buy back in after the predicted crash, in which case he may double or triple his BTC and I think he’ll make 100k a lot faster that way. That’s if there is a crash, we’ll see.

Bitcoin relies on the internet and currently the internet is centralised, with successful repealing of net neutrality preventing US citizens from communicating with bitcoin Nodes is trivial, don’t spout things you don’t understand as fact.
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:00:04
It would take a combined effort from all internet providers around the world to filter out packets attempting to interact with the bitcoin network, assuming every service provider was filtering these packets then VPNs would not help because the packets sent between VPN server and bitcoin node are unencrypted and can be filtered the same as normal unencrypted packets. However if even a small fraction of ISPs do not filter bitcoin network packets then VPNs which can reach nodes through those WAN links could facilitate communication with the bitcoin network. Not impossible, just difficult and very unlikely.
Governments themselves could not stop bitcoin but could make it illegal. Either banning bitcoin via packet filtering or banning it via making it illegal would require cooperation between governments and ISPs in countries where the government is not the ISP.

I’m sorry I didn’t realise you had learning deficiencies, I’ll leave you alone after this.
I was enlightening you since you obviously don’t understand how the internet works, never did I claim that you should sell bitcoin or that it will inevitably be banned, only that it’s possible
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:55:55
We’re not exactly on the same page, as long as you realise, however remote, that it is possible, and don’t just spout the ‘it’s impossible to ban’ narrative just cause you’ve heard it before .

Cash settled futures where you don’t have to admit ownership of the underlying asset allows people to profit from manipulating the price of BTC. So while futures will in no way directly affect BTC price it is extremely naive to think that they won’t have any effect.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:16:38
Zero sum game of long and short contracts is unrelated to what people will actually do with their BTC. Someone in a long position may try to artificially raise the price to fulfill long position, someone in short position may try to dump and artificially crash price, neither is guaranteed to happen. With the insane rise of BTC recently however it suggests a lot of new money is entering which may be people setting up BTC ready to dump and short, which could crash BTC, that’s only a theory tho.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:56:15
Your sarcasm only indicates you are stupid and don’t understand the point well enough to refute it
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:03:25
You don’t even understand the fundamentals of internet communication if you think it is necessary to ban the entire internet just to ban bitcoin network interactions. I suggest you read about packet filtering as an extremely basic starting point. Also understand that all internet Packets travel through ISP WAN links and can be filtered by ISPs
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:16:40
Time will tell I guess
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:13:49
-buy up before futures to artificially raise price
-dump btc and short with futures
-after all dumped make long futures contracts and buy back cheap BTC
-rinse and repeat with no legal repercussions
If that happens then at least us average folks can make money by selling on the way up and buying on the way down.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:41:47
I’m not entirely sure which government you’re referring to. In the US there will soon be a vote about repealing net neutrality, which will (if it is repealed) allow ISPs to economically censor or even ban traffic based on source/dest ports and source/dest IP addresses. This could make interacting with any blockchain network more difficult and expensive than it currently is for US citizens. Assuming some sort of arrangement between banks, ISPs and the government than that is a possibility, but we’re entering conspiracy theory territory here. If crypto currencies become threatening enough I do see that being a possibility however.
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:55:56
Should probably also alert them that this isn’t the ‘official’ bitcoin subreddit
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:01:59
Given that BTC is the leader in crypto currencies I imagine that a large scale or long term crash for BTC would not bode well for other currencies and while they may increase in their BTC ratio I think they would decrease in their USD ratio.
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:56:54
Take precautions yourself for what should happen to your private keys if you die, with bitcoin you are your own bank, and so you need to take care of such things yourself. You can implement a solution using smart contracts or you can implement it via planning with your beneficiaries.
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:59:11
In B4 this gets censored
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:32:33
Fair enough, but if bitcoin is massacred I’m afraid it might put a bad taste in the mouth of all investors and lead to a bear market for all crypto currencies. I can’t say I know any better than you tho :P
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:45:45
Yes 100% confirmed bitcoin will increase in price forever, this guy fucks.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:55:15
I guess we’ll see, will be funny if the posts change exactly the same way they did when I made that post ;)

Edit: this comment appears to have come across more rude than I intended it to be  and so I’d like to apologise if it was offensive, to anybody, I meant it only as a snarky joke and hope I haven’t upset anyone.

Most likely nobody owns the address and nobody ever will
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:58:02
Definitely I can’t confirm this is what’s happening, but I guess in 2-4 months we will find out.

@_date: 2017-11-29 03:03:06
I believe there is definitely more spikes to come, but I was more illustrating that sometime soon we could see a crash not unlike the Mt Gox situation, albeit having very different causes.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:09:05
It’s that train of thought that will make bitcoin lose to other crypto currencies long term, if you refuse to adapt and change as circumstances change then you will be left behind. Whether or not a change to the POW algorithm is necessary right now or not, the mindset of ‘if you change anything about bitcoin it’s no longer bitcoin’ is not the mentality that bitcoin needs. Time goes on and technology gets outdated if technology doesn’t catch up then it will be left behind and overtaken by another technology that has evolved with time. Not to say anyone doing development for bitcoin actually gives much of a shit about what you or I say, but time has always caught up with technology that refuses to evolve.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:48:30
It really doesn’t make sense why so many people are against upgrading bitcoin. technology that stays stagnant will never be relevant for very long.
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:35:48
With the % cap it’s a contract by contract basis, which means that a contract cannot continue to make money after a rise or drop of 20% from the price set on the contract, however if the price drops 20% then a shorter could get another contract and then profit up to another 20% drop, meaning they can profit all the way down to a 100% drop (theoretically) by setting up more contracts.
Based on bitcoin daily volume (normally 1-4 billion) manipulation would not take a huge amount, 1 billion of market sell orders would DOUBLE the daily volume on a low volume day and since they are market sells they would directly impact price (as opposed to buys/sell within the margin which likely constitutes a large portion of daily volume) I don’t doubt that a group of big players could amass over 20 billion worth of bitcoin and dump 2 billion worth of it daily dropping the price hugely for 10 days, which could become a catalyst for a long bear market.
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:28:07
I think what he’s saying is there are a fair amount of people here that don’t understand economics, and don’t understand bitcoin, and only buy because they see all the news about price going up, and they buy it cause they think it will make them rich. 
That is a serious problem because those hands have weak hands, if you buy something with the only goal of it going up and making you rich, then when it goes down a fair amount below what you payed for it there is no confidence in you to continue holding it. This means that a fair sized dump can set off mass selling, especially when you consider Bcash shillers and investment firms can make money from bitcoin going down (in December with CME futures). In fact the long rally now could be partly due to institutions buying bitcoin in order to dump it and short it. 
Aside from that people who bought bitcoin only a couple weeks ago can make money by selling anywhere above 5.5k.
People who think bitcoin won’t correct obviously have not been in the game a long time. I am not saying it definitely will, but thinking that it can’t is retarded.

I think my comment came across much ruder than intended. I meant it mostly as a joke which is why I provided a source rather than only telling them to do it themselves. My apologies to the person who asked the question if they were at all offended by my response.
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:17:47
I definitely think In time it will recover, but short term if there is a crash it’s a great way to increase your bitcoin holdings.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:52:16
But if the rise is based on hype then it’s essentially baseless, meaning a swing in the perception could drastically affect the price.
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:39:31
I don’t think bitcoin can be ‘killed off’ but at the same time people won’t necessarily reinvest profits from shorting which could lead to a prolonged bear market.
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:27:43
Definitely a position I would advise given the current situation
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:31:16
Oh, I see, me laughing about people being naive in bitcoin and blaming a large crash entirely on Bcash shillers is definitely an effective refutation to my points. You’ve convinced me with your incredibly compelling argument.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:04:59
I believe you are right, but there comes a point where even long term believers may question their conviction, what if we drop down to 1k? Unlikely for sure, but we don’t really know the point at which people will lose faith, and if a crash could bring us down to that point.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:38:30
If every upgrade to bitcoin gets renamed then the currency named ‘bitcoin’ will eventually become useless compared to its upgraded counterparts 
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:52:45
More daily transactions than BTC, faster transaction times, lower transaction fees, 0x is a smart contract I use to trustlessly trade ERC20 tokens without needing an exchange. Ethereum is dead? Lmao. Right now bitcoin has a better inflation rate than Eth (lower which means better) and a hardcap on tokens that will ever exist. Bitcoin is better as a store of value than ETH is, but in terms of transactions, ETH is the most proven crypto that exists, that’s discarding the usefulness of smart contracts entirely.
