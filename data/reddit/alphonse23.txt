Hate to be a buzz kill, but the ad doesn't mention how to convert those satoshis into cash -- at least with Western Union it's easy to convert your order into bills, with btc you have to meet someone through a shady website.

no, should I have?

So then it was just Gox automating withdrawal resends? Every so often someone could withdrawal more coins than they really had, once they figured out how to game the non-matching IDs?

I have a lot more btc than 0.0286 BTC. It was just an experiment purchase. Just wanted to enjoy the thrill of buying something with btcs for the first time.

I still have pretty much all my coins on coinbase. I feel like they're safer there, than on my laptop, which could easily be stole from me.
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:37:27
embezzlement seems really unlikely, he's not acting at all like someone who stole money -- more like a kid that fucked up something really important and is still trying to come to grips with the severity of what he's done. 
But yes, everything has yet to add up. I really wish I knew what the hell was going on.
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:18:37
This is the only thing I could find that explains it, though I still don't really understand. So there is still no record that 744,000 coins have gone missing?

See, we should really take down the link. This is all about getting page views. Take down the link and link a screen-capture instead to the Newsweek article. This is a really cruel thing to do to a innocent man.
@_date: 2014-03-04 01:12:38
But it's not really a job though. To do really amazing academic work it really does take enough time: 
All the economic pressure people put on academia leads to bad work. To do the work that Peter Higgs has accomplished you really need to give a person enough time, otherwise you wind up with what we have now, an academic system completely bent on pushing out shit paper after shit paper -- and never anything of real value.
I suppose there should be a balance, but I really think society needs to rethink it's perspective on the academic system.
@_date: 2014-03-03 23:18:50
See that's too bad. Contrary to what twfry was saying, I really think society would in fact benefit from allowing it's citizens to be perpetual 30+ PhD students if they want to be.
One of my friends works at a major university in California, he's a postdoc, and he told me he had to let some the phd students go in his department if they were taking longer than 4 years to finish their dissertations, or as he called it "produce results", whatever that means. I find that a huge shame, really, in order to do good work a person should be given as much time as they need -- right?
@_date: 2014-01-05 22:07:54
It cost me 0.0286 BTC ($23.77 at the time, which is now $26.14 only one day later), while if I just ordered with a CC from the actually pizzahut.com site, it would have cost me $18.80. So I lost money on the deal.

How is this getting so many up votes. I posted about buying a pizza with bitcoins here a few weeks ago and it got a NEGATIVE SCORE!?! I thought this community was not into these kind of posts...

She screwed herself, she had no idea what she was getting into. She's going to get the thunder storm laid down upon her, and it's for the most part her fault.

So where are all the reports of double withdrawals or deposits if I'm understanding transaction malleability correctly. Nearly ever single time an error occurs on CoinBase (they do occur, but rarely, and they're always quickly resolved), somebody around here reports it and everybody hears about it. If transaction malleability was such a huge problem for gox, and if that much money was involved, why hasn't anyone been reporting mess ups in their own logs?
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:46:13
Same thoughts here too. Something seems really fishy about all this. I'm really confused how one could take that many coins and no one noticed.
Most of all I'm confused about how one can use transaction malleability to steal coins. If it's such a major exploit where are all the hackers claiming bragging rights?
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:53:08
Really, is it perfectly acceptable there to be a professional student? So are there societies out there that make it possible for someone to stay in school for as longs as they feel necessary? 
In the US, education debts and student loans are killing anyone who places any value in lengthy education. I mean, personally speaking, I think it should be perfectly fine to stay in school as long as a person wants to -- I believe education has it's value, and if a person wants to commit themselves to learning outside of industry, that sort of person plays an important role in our overall society -- I know not everybody sees things this way though. I feel like in the US, financial companies are taking advantage of the recent generational boom in higher education to lead the young and naive into large debts to make profits, thus in all reality you'd need to have money to begin with to invest in a long education or be willing to go into life crippling debt. In Germany, does the state make it financially possible for people to stay students as long as they want to?

Someone should take this down, and exchange it with a screen-capture instead, we shouldn't be giving newsweek page views. It's what they want.

I'm actually a little revealed that the hackers finally came forward. This is better not left as a mystery. At least Gox can rest assured that they were in fact hacked, as opposed to all the suspicions that Mark Karpeles was lying.
Why the hell are all the most bad ass hackers in Russia. I get the feeling like Russia is a hackers paradise.

I have a coinbase account, but you can't get cash from coinbase.
Is there an actual bitsimple store where I can go in an exchange bitcoins for hard currency?
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:20:06
So no one specific is really profiting from this. Just 744,000 coins mixed up out there in everybodies wallets. If that's the case, this really isn't as bad as I thought.
Maybe that's why Gox and Bitstamp were getting DDoS, someone was trying to get the multiple arbitrary withdrawals to occur more often.

at only a sample size of 1004, a population 313 million, the sampling error will obviously be well over 6%, ignoring that many probably did select xbox game as a joke.

Come on, this is a set back. It's not the end though, not even close. What does the PROC think their doing. They're slowing things down, but they can't stop the inevitable. Here here, another feather in your cap to show the world you're nothing but a repressive regime, holding your poor people back from catching up with the rest of the world.
I bought quite a few coins above $500 but I'm not selling. It might be a while before it's trading at $1000 again, but I'm more than sure it'll be back up there eventually.

Ally bank is the best bank. I love Ally bank -- though they can't do cash deposits, that's okay, because dealing in cash is only for strippers and drug dealers.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:35:55
yeah, it'll probably be back there not too far from today. Here's everything China blocks:  and they're all multimillionaire and multibillionaire everywhere else. China not supporting BTC hurts the BTC, but the worlds can still go on without China. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:03:09
All the trading is happening at the exchanges -- not between wallets. Thanks for bringing it up though -- now that I think of it, as btcs start being used like really currency, we should start seeing the transaction fees pile up. It would make for a good way of knowing btc are being used the way their meant to be -- and not for speculation.  
@_date: 2013-12-23 01:37:45
Love it though, has turned my Sunday into a very real-time entertaining day -- computer-wise. Bitcoins have made the internet is so much faster at everything.

There's more tomorrow. It's a two day conference.
@_date: 2013-12-15 22:34:19
You're right BTW. It is only 3%. I thought a sample of 1500 always yielded a 5% margin of error according to the central limit theory, but it's actually more like 1000 gives a 3% MOE and anything above is slightly smaller. But whatever, that still means it could be 3% and not 6% of Americans believe bitcoins is an xbox game. 6% in a survey with a 3% margin of error is still a pretty useless statistic. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:27:32
I'll be there on Tuesday. Coming in from Los Angeles.

if you sue BFL, why not Mt. Gox while you're at it. They fuck up pretty often and waste people's money all the time.
@_date: 2013-12-15 22:06:41
That sounds fair. Now that Coinbase just got a huge investment they have the money to refund anybody that gets ripped off because of a flaw in their security. Seems only fair -- I'd vouch for it if I worked at coinbase.

There was only one hippy girl there dressed eccentrically who was trying to promote a website for fresh off the farm packets of tea for bitcoins... There was sadly a great lacking in free-spirited all-natural types at this conference, probably because it cost $400 dollars for the two day pass...

Good point. The wealth distribution in BTC was discussed briefly during a question -- it's speculated that many of the top wallets are in fact lost BTCs, owned in the beginning, but then forgotten and thrown away by negligent earlier adopters -- something like that. But yes, I do realize my stake in the BTC wealth is marginal -- I'm just interested in how it will change things, more so then how I'll make a profit. I know to leave the heavy investing to the big shots on wall street.

Read these two articles, they go into a lot of depth as to how to access the true long term value of a btc. One from 2007, when it was priced at $9 and the other when it was $800-900 this Nov.

Not a lot of Chinese even know about it -- nor do many of them care from what I've heard (the CEO of AsiaNexgen told me this). The only reason why they control such a large chunk of the market is because there's a billion people in China, and also Chinese just generally have a lot of money right now to spend on anything. The Chinese have just been buying up a lot of stuff period, of late.
I imagine, the smarter ones amongst them will figure out a way around this and capitalize on the issue, while the majority wont care -- and as btc become more standard in the west, the PRC will drop restricts as perceived risks evaporates.

I've only been playing the BTC market so I don't know much about traditional stocks, but from the looks of it, it started trading at $140 10 years ago then it crashed, and now it's trading at around $3 a share... That doesn't sounds too bullish.
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:21:14
Those things are so expensive, personally speaking, I couldn't blame them for having trouble meeting the volume, just like every other bitcoin business out there today.
