Has to do with the [Moiré pattern](

I posted another thread and then found yours. Dang, this is getting a lot of people!
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:27:18
Damn, those people are like "what... I have $1700 now?!"
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:30:05
Well dang, this seems pretty widespread!
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:12:50
Possibly even today! Haha. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:56:15
I am not on Bittrex, personally. The only common factor I'm seeing so far is Coinbase. Might just be coincidence though since tons of folks are on Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:01:56
Huh. Now this is strange.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:30:00
And back down, whaaatttt
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:47:16
I'm on GDAX. Which had a weirdly high spread. It was 4k above other exchanges for a bit. Wild.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:16:03
Haha, yes, mostly joking. But I also wouldn't even be *that* shocked at this point.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:26:36
Over 19 now.
Edit: $19,400.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:02:32
I've never used block.io
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:41:46
Yep, I think I saw that.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:25:30
18 now, lol. Almost 19.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:15:34
I do not have a BTC-e account.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:31:04
Turns out, it actually might now, haha. We came prettttty close on GDAX.
@_date: 2019-08-13 12:17:35
Wait -- you can't just deposit with your phone?
@_date: 2019-08-20 12:18:48
*Schrödinger's Satoshi*
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:49:21
Some folks think it could go to 100k or even 1 million.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:09:57
Don't worry. You'll buy a yacht with that in a few years.
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:14:24
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:49:01
Ha, we'll see who's laughing when I'm sitting on one of my million yachts, bub.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:44:43
Hope so!
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:56:22
I'll pay you double that for them.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:47:07
Going back up a bit now. All sorts of ping pong happening.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:44:51
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:04:00
It's on and off. I kept trying and was able to get in as the dip was on its way back up in the low 9000's.
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:24:07
Back in my day with dogecoin, we all had full copies of the blockchain!
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:16:45
Please let me know when this jump to 48k is going to happen, thx.
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:05:21
"4 people dead and 3 injured in a pileup earlier today seemingly caused by a man shocked by a steep drop in the price of Bitcoin. I guess you could say it's really a...
( •_•)&gt;⌐■-■
...Bitcoin crash."
Edit: Added more sunglasses.
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:19:01
A 49mph red light?
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:41:18
The [image]( in [post]( that was responding to.
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:05:01
I'm aware. I just meant that I don't think Coinbase is that crazy insecure that you need to move all your coins from them instantly.
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:53:55
From what I know, if you're trading or want to have funds ready to buy quickly, GDAX or Gemini would do ya fine. Otherwise, if you're holding, a secure private wallet seems like it would be the best option.

@_date: 2017-11-29 06:11:50
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:37:17
I will make you one for the low price of 1 Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:03:14
Hmm, as long as you have a paper backup, using something like Mycelium should be very easy. Or just simply doing a paper wallet would also be quite simple. -- 
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:42:18
And how does Dogecoin work into this?
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:44:30
[But remember this -- when I dip. You dip. We dip.](

If the dollar goes down, you'll just be able to buy less Bitcoin with it.
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:35:59
You'll regret that when it goes to 196'165.61" and you miss out on numerous dollars, buddy.
