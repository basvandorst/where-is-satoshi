If you are only in it to make money, look at chain group, thats all they do is make money and you can start with some of the groups with as low as 10 dollars. No one can predict what bitcoin will do, if it continues the way it has been it could reach 20 or even 30 thousand very quickly, if it hits 30 that is almost double your money. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:09:41
Not really sure on that one. I just know that unless you use an atm to withdraw cash they dont charge fees.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:37:47
lol it just hit 19k o.0 catch up bro.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:45:11
If you use a shift card, attach it to your coinbase account, you can spend your coin with out fees.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:56:22
500%? I think? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:04:46
Shift Card.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:30:54
On a serious note, how does one go about getting their own paper wallet? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:35:20
I like Gemini better anyway, can trade in higher volume lol. I just like that coinbase has the shift card =\
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:30:01
Its only 10 dollars to buy the card, and then the only fee to use it is if you go to an atm to get out cash. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:38:33
Man seriously, been thinking about it.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:00:41
That is a very good point.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:28:25
Shift card?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:38:51
So get part of one, you don't have to buy a full one.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:56:07
I would suggest using a bot, or going with a group that uses bots.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:41:53
Ah, mk thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:02:00
But if you sell you won't be avoiding these tax laws....You will be playing right into them. If you want to avoid them, Hodl and wait for better tax reform to happen for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:45:58
The big allure of bitcoin is to get away from the government and banks. A lot of steadfast bitcoiners would steer clear of a fed based coin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:02:41
Hes the creator so yea, its possible.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:25:17
I live in the States, I am a systems admin at a prison. Not only do I not make enough money to pay all my bills, I make so little that I was approved for food stamps....so yea....
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:52:58
go to the shift website and it allows you to connect a coinbase account with it, and order the card, it costs 10 dollars. Then you can use it like a debit card anywhere.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:44:49
I learned about it when it was at 200 and thought it was to expensive for me lol. *shoots self in foot*
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:03:01
Wow doubled since yesterday that is nuts. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:22:26
Ummm, shift card+coinbase=using bitcoin in every day situations.
@_date: 2018-08-16 21:20:15
Bitcoin could also hit 30k tomorrow. I COULD win the lottery. Just about anything COULD do just about anything. I hate articles like this...no one knows wtf is going to happen. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:19:39
over the last month or 2 ive seen the value go from 1200 to 4500 so maybe now? Maybe wait. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:25:59
Yea if you are going to do it use a bot.
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:51:05
Except its not a ponzi scheme either, They use your money to run a trade bit for daily profit. I did see one the other day but forgot what it was called. The deposit to withdrew line were running in perfect parallel with withdrew staying under deposit. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:44:27
So just 13 and 19?
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:47:29
Wow...a billion dollars worth....insane.
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:01:48
Id guess the trade bots.
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:29:25
Depends on life style, area, and if it hits its 1 million mark by then. If you live a modest life with a modest house, a wife, and 2 to 3 kids, you need roughly 2.3 million in the united states? Think that was the average. It also depends how far you already are along and how old you are. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:06:11
Because it hooks you up with groups that invest your money in their bots and configurations? Really confused at people thinking that its a scam, is it the idea of a bot they are scared of? The idea of daily profit? What is it? Because you can run a bot yourself and make daily profit so why id a group doing it so scary?
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:29:14
Hmmm well good to know thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:19:21
Good thing comcast isn't in my area, and the president has nothing to do with them pushing that, they have been pushing it since bush I believe, Obama for sure. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:57:40
Eh compare them to say infinite finance and you will see a real exit scam lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:34:25
Lol k, also the moon landing was staged and the world is flat. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:06:09
Yea think they will need to increase the amount of transactions per block to allow more transaction fees in.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:56:50
Well excuse me, ive only seen news on comcast pushing it. Second I don't have a majority of those in my area so....
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:45:57
Its not working for me the continue button never lights up 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:06:39
Have him check out chain group, he can invest and compound that money to grow it a great deal. Or if he is clever himself and wants to tackle running a bot himself most of the trade groups run gunbot which is a coin trading bot allowing the user to generate daily profit depending on how well he configures it.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:14:18
I would suggest a bot if you are going to do that. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:43:32
 No thanks got all the profit i need from the bot i hand coded. But hey careful those mystical bots don't scam you out of that profitable forex EA. Would hate that. Lol
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:25:24
Was more thinking OP used that picture to depict that his ex boss was a dictator lol.
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:54:36
It wont even let me login on the website lol
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:07:29
Isn't tesla only supporting each model for 2 years though? and is that 620 miles per charge? cause damn if it is...
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:51:13
Only 70%? +1016.28%
SINCE LAST YEAR (%)
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:40:22
How did you write out the amounts cause ive flipped em too.
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:50:27
Yea exactly and ive done every combo there is.
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:15:21
Damn pay to drive models...lol
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:09:42
"Create flappy bird and not take it off the market a month later." FTFY I agree with personthingman, buy all bitcoins and hodl like a mad man lol.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:35:57
Oh no I am sure they will, I have 0 faith in any kind of business. But I can dream and think that they would see the logic in it. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:17:06
Ive gone from being a "barely scraping by" to an investor making good money. Largely thanks to my grandfather who trusted me enough to lend me some money to get started. I can't wait for the day though that bitcoin becomes widely accepted. Though I already ordered my Shift card.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:07:25
"Thankfully she didn't win" FTFY
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:55:09
Yea not working was 13 and 19 and ive tried every way.
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:46:38
Gemini? Or in person?
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:53:47
Don't think so? Curious what would you change about it? I'm not affiliated with this website in anyway, but I am starting to do website design and programming and stuff so curious what would make that more inviting for you?
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:06:00
There is still going to be sales tax, people are still going to have to work, even if you are being paid in bitcoin, they can tax that. Yea usd might go away, or equivalent, but the government will still get their money.
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:21:15
It hooks up to coinbase and one other wallet and lets you spend like a debit card. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:33:28
Pretty sure I heard something about a scam on that site? Gemini lets you buy a lot more than coinbase does.
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:13:47
Rip in pieces.
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:20:27
I like how is his picture is putin lol
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:21:16
But how could they even know or tell? Doesn't the shift card spend just like a visa? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:05:39
A bot that day trades for you is a scam?
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:46:19
Yea was going to say, there is so much wrong with all these statements lol. We have net neutrality now. They are trying to get rid of it.
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:58:51
Yea did that still didnt work :/
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:34:27
I make 2k a month and am struggling to pay bills. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:28:49
I get more than that a day with chain group lol. As far as banks go though, that is pretty high percent.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:47:39
I read somewhere that due to the increase in difficulty bitcoins shouldnt run out till like 2236. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:56:11
Gemini seems to let you do more. Also find an in person seller? Probably the best way.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:15:05
Eh yea but all of them do it. I wouldnt show my financial statements either because then you would be mad im making more money then you lol, plus if they loose money and ppl know who they are they could go after them. Plus tax avoidance and all that.
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:30:34
Yea i did that did .13, 0.13, 13. All that.
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:14:15
Ah thought you were suggesting if he quit his job.
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:04:26
Someone did on youtube lol, next video on the list was calling him a IRS scammer.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:45:28
If you are looking for something to buy into the market to earn money? I would check out chain group. If you are just looking for a consultant to tell you if you should invest well...that I don't know. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:48:00
Sure, start laying down lines now to get ahead of it.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:29:09
Right, which comcast is the only ISP pushing for this, and you know damn well they paid him off to do that. And what do you think is going to happen to comcast if they roll with that? Think their customers will be happy? Or jump ship? If another ISP stands against it they are going to sky rocket popularity wise.
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:17:02
Where do you see this?
@_date: 2018-03-07 21:45:55
What they are saying is, there is 180k worth of bitcoin about to go on sale. Get your black friday bats ready bois!
@_date: 2018-04-13 00:36:26
Thx bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-07 16:42:06
I want a tesla lol
@_date: 2018-04-24 23:21:25
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:46:42
citibank does it here in the States. They will close your account if they see anything bitcoin related.
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:03:06
Yea idk, didn't happen to me I have a different bank, but Some one else had posted a screen shot of an email they got from citibank closing their account.
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:20:25
Pretty sure the day it hit 19k was higher lol
