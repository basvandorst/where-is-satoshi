Interesting idea!  I'm now considering adding this as a Subway sandwich.

Honestly, I am a small business owner who has been accepting bitcoin for almost 8 months now.  
Not a single aspect in the section: "10 Major Risks for U.S. Small Businesses" has posed as a threat for us. 
I'm an actual small business owner accepting bitcoin.  Trust me.

The same logic is with dollars, if I spend $12 on a meal today, I could have used that same money to invest in Bitcoin.

that would be epic.

Not that I am aware


It has gotten much, much easier of the past few years.  I suspect it will get even easier in the future few.

You would be surprised....

haha, employee turnover can be up to 100% a year.  But this is a valid point, especially when apps/pos/systems are changing every few months.

Well, there was a time period when the Coinbase Merchant app was not working properly and I was a bit confused.  However lately everything has been working just fine and everyone is trained.  I have also been to the last few meetups myself.   
Not to worry, Nobody gettin fired...

Dear Fellow Redditors/Bitcoiners
My name is Sapan Shah and I am the owner of the Subway in Allentown, PA now accepting Bitcoin.  I am as much of a Bitcoin fan as all of you and have been ecstatic about the latest stream of good news. 
I started accepting Bitcoins at my Subway a week ago and did not expect it to generate the amount of attention it did.  I am absolutely floored by the support of the r/Bitcoin community and cannot thank all of you enough for all the encouragement.
I started accepting Bitcoins thinking I might have 1-2 customers a week and would slowly increase.  I figured after a few weeks I would have a great story about all the positive benefits we had by accepting Bitcoins (increase in sales, lower merchant fees, instant payment, etc.).  I could then present this information to other retail merchants to show them it can be done.  Worst-case scenario, I would get to meet a few Bitcoin fans (like myself). I did not expect people to travel 2-3 hours to come support us and I did not anticipate the number of Bitcoin-paying customers that we had.  One week later, I believe we already have a truly incredible story to tell others.  
No this was not a fraud.  No this was not a fake.  And No, after one week, corporate has not shut us down.    
I know many of you are planning on coming down to the store today to support us and I feel terrible for charging anyone driving 2-3 hours to support us, but I realize that is the point of coming.  A free cookie is the least I could do and we will give 20% off to any Bitcoin customer who shows up.  I’m really excited to meet all the new Bitcoin users and have been working to facilitate the transaction process.  I really think everyone should talk to other business owners and encourage them to start accepting Bitcoins.  If they don’t believe you- refer them to me!   
To The Mooooon!!!!
