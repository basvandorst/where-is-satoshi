This is exactly what I told my friend. Let's dox him then return it. May get some goodies or actual currency.

J was an intriguing find nonetheles.

I've never used these type of cards before? Wouldn't it have a pin number to it?

He wasn't to thrilled about being doxed but grateful for his card and turning it over to the police. Not sure if r/bitcoin allows illegal discussion, but he got a sick reward from a far away market.

Not interested in stealing. I've been exit scammed to many times lol

No there is only 12 digits.

Yeah I thought about this, but what if the police suspect he is using bitcoin for illegal purposes, he may become under some sort of surveillance, and if he is using the markets then I just ruined his opsec.

Tried that no one in the city or surrounding cities shows up. Think the dude might not have Facebook. Even checked spoke pipl whitepages and zaba. Unless it's one of the 80 year olds.

Wouldn't he need the pin the number? I've never used these debit cards only electrum. I'm gonna post it on Facebook but require tonsee their ID first.
