Hey, I'm trying to do this but entirely on my homelab and only using CentOS. So far I've got the the wordpress server up and running. But now I'm up to the woocommerce bit. I'm not too happy about it needing an account to get it. I see they provide the source code on their github. Is there a simple precompiled package I can get that I can just drop into my self hosted wordpress server?

I really like this. The chart listing sats in groups of K, M, G makes much more sense and looks exactly what metric is in most places today. 
100M Sats = 1 BTC.
I dunno, I just got a bachelor's degree in computer science so I'm probably biased to this.
I really hate the notion of 'bit' in BTC, being 100Sats. To me, a bit is a bit. A byte is 8 bits. It's only going to perpetuate the confusion between 'ibi' and and base ten bytes. Etc KiB vs KB.

Awesome thanks for the link, I manually extracted it into the plugins folder, restarted httpd and it appeared. I don't have any ability to "Add New" though, seems like I have to add everything manually. I can't even add themes through the webserver admin panel. Oh well, adding them manually works so that's great, now I can progress some more :)

I don't know about you, but I live today in an era where computers are everywhere and the subject being discussed was born of them. 
I'm glad we have the metric system. It's useful sometimes to let go of old notions (even 100-200 year old ones) to make way for a more future compatible and easily manipulable and workable protocol.

Fungibility is already here thanks to tumblebit for Bitcoin!

Wouldn't stratis's tumblebit technology for Bitcoin via the breeze wallet provide fungibility?
