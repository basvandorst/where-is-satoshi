They can go less fees but only for so long, it does cost money to facilitate transactions. You can pay your expenses by printing money, but you dilute your currency.

What will the miners be rewarded with once all 21m coins are mined? Fees. Currently the fees go to them and they will continue to once we mine 21m bitcoins.

The problem with that thinking is that that’s always a possibility

I never said there was a group, you suggested there was a group- a group who would suffer. I said they “might suffer”. 
Will bitcoin help people? you said it would hurt people I said it wouldn’t. You’re projecting

You’d think so right? That really should be the case shouldn’t it. But questions like why doesn’t it cost 0 for a transaction are very similar to questions like why do we have to wait 3 days for funds to settle. 
I think we’d find that these things are very related and haven’t been done away with for similar reasons. At this point, the value proposition of USD is safety, reversible transactions, etc. when you take away the 3 day transaction time, the transactions I’m sure become harder to reverse, and when you stop charging fees, you can’t pay people to mediate the disputes etc.
I agree though it sounds like it could cost 0. A great starting point to that is why doesn’t it already cost 0, then we get in to bitcoins solution, it doesn’t cost nothing, but every penny goes to the people facilitating the transactions. There’s no business owner who needs to take a cut. Everyone involved is working and getting paid correlating to the amount of transactions they process.
It’s a great point though. I think about it some times. 
It really should be free, shouldn’t it? By all logic it should be free. There’s plenty of competition: there’s plenty of banks, plenty of payment processors.

You can become a miner today with a laptop. 
The miners are third parties sort of in the same way the federal reserve is a third party technically maybe, but anyone can become a miner, it’s not regulated in the way most payment processing is.

Well what good is someone’s agreement to trade if they don’t agree to any particulars? Sure they “have to trade with us” but if they charge us 10x more than they charge anyone else, and pay us 10x less, did we really negotiate anything at all besides basically a theatrical formality.
I think we’re sort of riding the wave of momentum of all these informal unspoken agreements that could go away at any moment- like the agreement that a can of soda is worth $1
