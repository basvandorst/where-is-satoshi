Shouldn't get educated be in there?
Or at least a very basic one liner on why to buy in the first place??
What's happening is people couldn't give a shit why bitcoin is here but only to make a few quick bucks

Every second of that was awesome!

Is that what is going to drive the price of bitcoin up?
I was sitting here wondering with the increasing price of each coin fewer and fewer people will be able to afford investing in bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:23:07
What do you mean by charged?
As the price goes up so does the transaction fee?
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:25:58
Got it. I didn't know about the buying fee being a percentage.
Do you know a lot about bitcoin?
I have a few questions I'd like answers for if you have the time
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:24:08
Yeah. I couldn't help myself!!
I had the chance to purchase bitcoins a few years ago and didn't. Until yesterday it never crossed my mind again. Then bam 8,000!!:)
