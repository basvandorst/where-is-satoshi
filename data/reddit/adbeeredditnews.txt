Probably because he didn’t buy enough to retire yet

With all these seemingly positive news from China regarding bitcoin, I can’t help but think that they decided to use bitcoin as a pawn in the whole geopolitical game against the US. It’s difficult for a newspaper to publish something without towing the party line the same way as it is difficult for a company such as Alibaba to integrate Lolli without any approval from the people higher up.
It’s going to be interesting how the whole thing plays out.

As sad as this sound, in many places $1,000,000 is not enough anymore to retire. Being a millionaire is great, sure... but can you stop working if you have that amount (considering taxes, rent/upkeep, inflation etc)?
All the power to you if you can!

In the US you mean. Bitcoin can still easily become a viable payment option all around the rest of the world.

I agree with the assessment that we will be confronted with high inflation. However stocks will adapt to the inflation. Imagine that on day 1 a loaf of bread costs 1 and the stocks of a company are worth 100 and on day 2 the same loaf of bread costs 10 (huge inflation)... it doesn’t mean you still get the same stock for 100. The stock prices will adapt simply because the assets of the company do not halve in value. The machinery is still there, the IP as well etc.
It has however been observed in the past that there is a lag between inflation of stock prices and inflation of other goods such as food items. But stocks are still relatively inflation safe.
You may argue however that the current “stock rally” is partially a symptom of already present inflation. Companies are not really worth more but the QE money flows there first.

The official bitcoin client is still in beta, a decade after it was launched.

The IRS only comes into play if he lives in the US. I don’t know if that’s the case given that many countries don’t have capital gains taxes.

According to reports, that actually happened to Spaniards when they tried to flee tenochtitlan in the “niche triste”. Many were drowned when trying to cross the canals. They were dragged underwater by the gold they were trying to take with them.

I think your expectations are unrealistically low. Did you really expect the sort of viral growth the video of a beer drinking cat would get? 24 hours and everyone uses bitcoin? We are talking about money, one of the most precious resources a human has. It takes time.

Meanwhile here in Switzerland (neighbour of germany) you don't have to pay any tax on your profit.

Please don’t forget that you are talking about a very regional issue whereas bitcoin is global. There are many many bitcoin users (arguably millions) not subjected to such limiting capital gain taxes (e.g. in wealthy and highly developed countries such as Germany, Switzerland, Malta and others) but at the same time you see no widespread usage of bitcoin as a currency in those either.
So many on reddit have the US perspective... but there aren’t such boundaries for bitcoin.

Currently every day 1800 bitcoins are mined. That means that roughly this amount is put into the marked and sold daily.
Now interestingly enough it also means that to sustain the current price, the interest is so low/high that the buyers who want these 1800 bitcoins are actually paying the current price every day to get all of them. What happens if suddenly only 900 get into the market daily? If the buyers are accustomed to get 1800 but only 900 are available they either start competing for those available (through price) or they accept that the same money buys them less now because less are available. Which conversely means that they get less bitcoin for the same price or... each bitcoin is worth more.
Think of it as if a boy in school sells 1800 pieces of candy a day and suddenly starts bringing only half. The question now is the following: will the other boys and girls still pay the same price for this candy even though there is way less available? Keep in mind that before the supply shock all the candy sold out every day.
How would that be priced in? School boys and girls willingly paying more before the candy halvening to account for the decreased supply and thus pricing it in? Or someone hoarding candy and then selling them at the halvening for half price? Maybe, but keep in mind they will eventually run out of them and they still need to make a profit and thus add a margin. Miners certainly accumulate before a halvening which in my opinion accounts for the lag in price movement. But it’s quite difficult to price in the supply shock for a good that is exchanged on the current volume and at a daily basis.
It’s a bit more complicated than this (feedback loops etc), but the halvening is difficult to price in and will force a new equilibrium to be found.

I may be wrong but I’d argue that if you use a hardware wallet and write down its backup phrase on a piece of paper you are about as secure as writing down the seed phrase on a piece of paper.

So basically you don’t care about the technology, you are in bitcoin because you want a shortcut to riches?
