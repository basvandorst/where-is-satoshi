Hire a lawyer and file a claim, or file a lawsuit.  If there's coverage that's the only way you'll find out.

Hire a lawyer and file suit.  If this comes down to limited assets with exceptional liabilities (which it sounds like the case), you're going to want to be one of the first in line.

Yes, and I'm no expert on property law, but generally first in time, first in right.  So given the seemingly small amount of assets to cover tremendous liabilities, the people affected have a massive interest in being the first one to file suit/get a judgment.

Because in our society and the legal environment we live in, the people with stolen goods only true recourse is through the civil court process.  Sure, shit on lawyers all you want, but I can tell you that the first people to file suit are going to benefit the most when this puppy gets divvied up...and it will.  If I had lost money, I would have filed a Complaint the second I became aware.

You go man.  I think you should get after it.  This case poses significant difficulties procedurally, but I wish you the best.  I think all this sit back and hopefully it'll all be ok mentality is bound to end up in those folks getting screwed the most.  File suit, get your place in line clearly established.

From a long time hodler, this BU/Core fighting made me too damn nervous.  I have some serious concerns about utility going forward.  I'm cautiously optimistic, but I just couldn't take the heat so I hopped out...for a few days at least.
