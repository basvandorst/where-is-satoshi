10+ actually.

Well I would be using binance from now on, but need to get my coins back first.

Not really, they were coming from another exchange which was proven to them. Seems like just the amount deposited by a new user put them off, as far as I can tell.
However, after all the verification I did they should have released them but...

One that wants to buy some other cryptos as well?
@_date: 2018-10-10 11:52:47
@_date: 2018-10-10 13:50:52
not a small amount here either

Yes they do it, but do they have the legal right to do so?
@_date: 2018-10-09 19:15:04
Well how is one supposed to trade otherwise?
@_date: 2018-10-10 11:52:18
Yes but I wanted to catch a good price.

I've provided ton of documentation, stuff that no other exchange has ever asked from me. You keep asking for stuff like gmail and facebook? How is that serious?
@_date: 2018-10-10 11:53:55
Their subreddit seems to be full with similar cases and it seems like they dont care
@_date: 2018-10-10 17:40:58
Probably just a virtual office?
@_date: 2018-10-10 13:00:46
And I just noticed that they've deleted my post in their subreddit without even contacting me. It still sends a message though.
@_date: 2018-10-10 13:32:56
Do they even have the right to ask for all that?
KYC is just ID and proof of address mostly right?
@_date: 2018-10-10 11:56:20
I provided full ID and source of funds, including income.
They keep asking for random stuff like gmail, facebook, skype and so on.
I'm using free email provider, why?

Yes! You seem to be everywhere and very fast too! Thank you so much! :)
