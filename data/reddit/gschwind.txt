So they say this is not your hard earned money. I would not negotiate. Its a waste of time.
Just fork your financial life to an institute that respects your sovereignty over your money.

XBT is too transparent and too easy to use for the avarage joe who just wants to store his savings in a inflation and confiscation proof way.
Lets be honest about those "well respected" financial geniuses. They were either lucky or used insider trading to get their fortunes. So they just feed on joe, who has no access to insider information. XBT cuts out all this. So its ok for his kind to tell this stories. He has to.

A government can use a sourveign currency to do good. But the opposite is also true. We all know how wars are paid: printing press.
In the end it does not matter what currency is installed. It will always be abused by the ones who want more power and the ones who want to stay in power.

By avarage man you mean the middle class, i suppose. It's true, they hate the middle class, because the middle class families are eating "their" ressources. So here, take the bankster austerity pill and die.

You should take into account, that the human race can evolve at will. We can change carrying capacities of habitats for each lifeform. Not long ago we could not support 100 million people on this planet - a "boubble". Those services provided by only 100 million were very view and we lived in caves. We evolved.
Times will come, when we will need those 50 or 80 billion well educated people living in robust, enjoyable habitats to provide enough know how and services (~20times more noble prices for geniuses!) to resolve problems that will come.
So the idea for the future should be: not run into a boubble voluntairly - evolve.

Best advice I can give: focus on explaining how the protocol works. You may want to present the YT vid. "how bitcoin works under the hood".

Make that 2 Days, not 1 week. Some guys want to shake loose the weak hands.
