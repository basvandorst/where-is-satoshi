I use Linux in a hyper-v virtual machine, encrypted vhd, encrypted user account, encrypted wallet (all different paswords) and I only use that wallet to feed a Coinbase account when needed for purchases; otherwise the VM is off. Also, I use that VM only for a btc wallet and nothing else.

Could this "bug" be exploited to make Bitcoin more anonymous and therefor more fungible?

Now they just need to change their name to the Satoshi Kings.

We don't know which people are standing for what is my point. Some people are standing for getting paid around ~$50 a day USD to protest because Ukraine is quite a poor country. I'm sure the same people who would take that money wouldn't mind some Bitcoin donations as well. Perhaps some are protesting, hoping for a better life, but how can we tell which is which. Plus life was just as bad in the Ukraine before the trade agreement stuff; why weren't the people out on the streets protesting before this? And if they were why is this national news all of the sudden? Why wasn't it before?

The Ukranian situation is political theater. Governments are paying protesters on both sides. The US gov has already allocated 5 billion for paying people to protest. The video speculates one reason we would want Ukraine in the EU is to put missiles there for leverage over Russia(i.e. the neo conservative agenda). And that's the kind of thing that got the US into the Cuba Missile Crisis which is the closest our civilization has ever come to ending. In addition, joining the EU is a bad idea; the money lost because of corruption in the EU is greater than the GDP of Ukraine. I'm not pro Russia or anything - I think Ukraine should keep it's sovereignty.

I &lt;3 Satoshi too but not sure he needs charity... If he wants body guards, he can cash in 0.000001% of his Bitcoin and get some. He could like buy Newsweek and fire Leah if he wanted to.

If you look at the "about" section in under the youtube video all the sources are linked but for your convenience I will link too:

I think Swag makes a good point with the targeted marketing. Whatever we can do to get *anyone and everyone* interested/involved in a community that doesn't see race/sex/nationality is good in the long run.. Even if we have to meet that subgroup on comfortable ground to get them involved/exposed at first. This way of thinking can't help but rub off if exposed to long enough. World Civilization FTW

One overlooked problem with online wallets is not their security, it's yours. You could have 14 layer authentication but if a Trojan infected your computer and you are logged into that wallet that virus could piggy back off your authentication to gain access and transfer money out.

BTC donations are better served going to Wikileaks folks. Assange has no motive to lie/misinform (in fact quite the opposite) and Wikipedia pages have labelled stuff hes put out as fake news.
@_date: 2017-04-26 20:43:52
Such as?
@_date: 2017-04-26 21:43:54
I could see that as a possible motive but not probable. But until hes out living in a mansion he bought with bribe money there's no evidence he made such a deal. Plus when you leak on most governments' secrets they tend to just stick you in a hole somewhere not "water under the bridge" ya. The only reason hes alive is because he had the foresight to setup a dead mans switch for himself (people close to him, involved with wikileaks have not been so lucky). So I think its more likely a good Samaritan motive still as its likely he has no choice at this point to make the deal you refer to. Here's a video on his body language showing he believes what hes saying and not portraying: 
Of course, neither one of us could know for sure so I just try to go with likelyhoods.

I'm sure they will use a centralized payment processor(like bitpay) which will solve the problems you are worried above but also reintroduce all the problems bitcoin was spose to fix in the first place

We're not that far away from general AI(&lt; 50 years), then you just have to trust the AI.. if it doesn't kill us all first. But since the tech is so ubiquitous you could have multiple 3rd parties arbitrate without much additional overhead or decentralized 3rd parties if you will.

that part may happen easier when the US dollar collapses in less than 2 years, prob end of this year. the citizenry wont appreciate 50-80% of their purchasing power vanishing over night. they will flee to money that cant be counterfeited like precious metals and crypto. governments controlling the money supply is how they purchase votes and bribe; without that control it will shrink dramatically. the problem with a debt based economy is eventually you have to spend exponentially more money to achieve the same standard of living because the markets have been so distorted. this is called hyperinflation and is happening in Venezuela now.

Smart contracts would be the biggest labor saving invention mankind has ever come up with. You need to think outside the box a bit to come up with all the applications for it but its a lot. Decentralized apps on top of programmable money; you wouldnt need 90 percent of banks, government, lawyers, accountants, and that's not including the new things that we couldnt do before with this new paradigm.
