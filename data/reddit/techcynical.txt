not sure i follow one of their post that was most upvoted around 2 days ago were 9 direct quotes from bitcoin core said within the past 5 months that segwit is a blocksize increase. probably banned after saying this tho.

Oh? You wanna take it there? Go take a look at the vote manipulation after the price tanked from 2.8k to 1.7k on r/btc. And if you actually followed the scaling debate you must have took it way to litterally cause you would know half the shit that went down during 2015 and why there such a difference of ideas and hate between the subs

How is it bs info lol. Goto fork.lol you can prove it yourself
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:10:32
It's been a weak and a half I've doubled my money and bch is already on the road to fixing Eda. Not boasting just trying to prove not all r/BTC readers are headass morons who can't trade.

wait what the hell? march 2018? theyll already be a s11 by then blowing this out the water

This is about Bitcoin? Another  "competing" coin is favourable to miners right now. And with another difficulty change in 1 week ...
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:41:54
even if its literally whats happening right now? The hard fork just took place and its already more profitable to mine bch again.
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:03:38
Are you really that ignorant of numbers? Please goto fork.lol and see for yourself take at least 1 minute out of your life.

Comments now that it spiked from 3000 to at 3800

This is probably the most immature jackass thing I've seen. This kinda stuff makes people wanna turn away from bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:28:17
thanks for proving nothing at all. Some people use bitcoin cash people we dont wanna pay a 4$ transaction fee for coffee., Might as well pay in fiat if im going to use bitcoin cause itll cost significantly less.
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:28:32
I don't use it as a store of value that's why we don't see eye to eye. But yeah I bought at 350ish
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:07:15
What are my options if I hold my btc ( not all obviously ) in a wallet like paxfuls or localbitcoin or purse.io's wallet ?
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:03:44
I agree I don't know too much about eda but I do know its messing long term things up with difficulty.  I also hate all these stupid comments and down voting. "Oh this guy is using this bitcoin the way he sees fit and works better for him so let's down vote him"

No no no that's now what your doing here. Because for one this sub does not represent the entire bitcoin community. As for 2 if I'm looking for a mobile app to easily buy bitcoin or digital currency  and I see the most downaloded app coinbase has a 2.1 rating I'm for sure not gonna be downloading anything else because everything else is so damn hard and complex for the avg person and you guys end up hurting yourself. Your just barely hurting the company but rather hurting the cause
@_date: 2017-07-25 03:44:10
and thats why most people goto r/btc because they cant have anyone with a different opinion on this sub
@_date: 2017-07-23 20:43:06
Well its no doubt there are way more active users on this sub probably due to one or more reasons like how mainly everyone goes to r/btc after they get banned here for speaking their opinion mainly why I don't say anything here cause it'll probably get me banned and not surprised if this post will get me banned
@_date: 2017-07-23 05:35:50
as a active reader of only r/btc this sub looks like its filled with bots and shills
