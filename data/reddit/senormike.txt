Perhaps...I was a bit drunk last night. 


Feel free to pick one from the list I provided. 


Yes, oil is better than solar. 


Market share doesn't really matter in an expanding market, so long as your company is growing.
 And the big carriers and banks are the best ones for their customers?


Can't really compare them to Apple....As the they are government granted cartels. 


Not really. Virtually nobody had smartphones until the Iphone. They obviously invented something of value. 


You don't think making a usable mp3/smart phone is different? 


Well they did....Feel free to look at the website. 


Hooking up wheels to an engine was just a framework...I still think the automobile was an invention. Guess we just have different outlooks.

I can't list patented new inventions...In listing new inventions? Come on. 


Yes. Apple spends relatively less on marketing within the industry. Marketing does not explain them dominating the aforementioned markets. 


You could describe the transition to cars from horse and buggies in those terms.

You want me to list the patents associated with the three products I listed? 


Sure....Just amazing that they can spend less on marketing and still dominate entire market sectors....Without any innovation. 


(of a person) having the ability to create or design new things or to think originally.
Did they create/design something new? Yes. 


And some innovated user friendly products. 


Bringing together a number of preexisting features and adding some own technologies that they invented. 


What matters is the end user experience. Apple simply dominates at this in all of their ventures....Via being innovative and inventive.

Here you go...I use google(which also wasn't invented) to find it. 


The only rating that matters is money. And Apple dominates. 


Yea, but you are saying connecting the wheel to the engine was not an invention...Because both previously existed. 


No that was polish! You are a car fanboy :(

Why, I said they must have done a really good job. According to you they just took an existing product and marketed it better. Considering they use a relatively small budget for marketing, it is quite impressive. No? 


Making something complicated, simple...Is not inventive? How would you describe the process? 


Why didn't the companies who invented them, do that? 


I think the Apple II, Ipod and Iphone were all distinctly new and radically different than what came before. The amount of market share these products captured, alone, testifies to this. 
I personally think turning a technology into something useful, is in itself, inventive.

It produces relatively cheap energy? 


Why not just read it? 


The automobile didn't do anything that a horse and carriage couldn't do. I think thats an invention though. 
@_date: 2014-01-20 01:58:43
Apple II and Ipod were patented inventions. 
@_date: 2014-01-20 16:40:57
Why did those sell so well, when they already existed? 
@_date: 2014-01-20 01:00:26
apple II, ipod, ect...

Solar can be great while oil produces relatively cheap energy. 


The stone age didn't end for a lack of stones. As oil becomes more scarce, it will become more expensive. This will make transitions to other forms of energy happen. Currently, more we don't tap vast amounts of oil because it is relatively more expensive. As price of oil goes up, we will just start tapping that more. 


Well, its just gonna be me listing it. You saying its not. Me listing another. Might as well cut out the middle-man. You are saying in that list, they didn't innovate a single thing? 


Iphone was easier to control. You didn't have to clean up after it.

Wow, Apple has such relatively low marketing costs. They must have some really smart people working in the marketing department. 
But, what do you mean by polish? What new features did they polish? 
@_date: 2014-01-25 14:15:04


You said doing so was not valid? 


To be clear, listing the things they patented would be acceptable? 


Because Iphone users love the phones that Apple invents? 


So, you don't think putting those rubber wheels together with an engine...Was an invention? Interesting.

Apple II, Ipod, ect.
