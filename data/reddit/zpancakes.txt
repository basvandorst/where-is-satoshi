we will never see 20k per bitcoin again will we? You might say "no you idiot, bitcoin dropped 80% a couple years ago and now it is still up 1000000% or whatever", thing is there's probably never been a time where bitcoin has had so much media coverage or broken into the mainstream as it has these couple of weeks. I don't think it'll recover tbh. Damn should have sold.

if the us switched to bitcoin does the debt magically disappear? No, the U.S will still owe trillions of dollars worth of bitcoin.
what's the point of this post?

world gdp = $110 trillion
number of bitcoins = 21m
$110 trillion/21 million = $5.2 million per bitcoin
it's first grade spongebob.

most people got into crypto because they think it is an easy way to get rich and usually cash out before even using their coins, probably only a small minority actually believe in the technology and that it will actually replace fiat currencies backed by governments.

won't happen. about half of the world's population doesn't even have internet access, let alone devices such as a smartphone or computer to store bitcoins, make payments, or receive bitcoins. Fiat currency will still be dominant given its simplicity and ease of access to pretty much anyone.

there's magnitudes of difference between going from a couple hundred to thousands vs going from thousands to tens of thousands. Also the reason bitcoin spiked so much over the the last 2 months of 2017 was due to FOMO and media coverage like never before, and what this means that pretty much anyone who would want to invest in crypto probably already has or did. When you got middle school kids, average joes from waitresses to stay at home moms talking about crypto and the price hits 20k, and you are saying it will go above that or hit it again after a major crash this past month? That's delusional my friend.

the 'HODL' meme is overused to prop up the value of bitcoin as others cash out.

judging by how fast bitcoin went from 5k -&gt; 20k, I would not be surprised if the majority of bitcoin holders right now bought at the 10k+ mark, which would mean a very big loss for them despite the fact that bitcoin is still up 1000x since inception or so.
