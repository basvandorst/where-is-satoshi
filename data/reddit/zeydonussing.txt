Just when i thought i could only get so hard.

Ask vendors your regularly visit if they accept bitcoin. Even if they don’t, by asking them the question it will get them thinking.

Don’t worry. No sales were made in the making of this post!

HODL’d hard through that dip, my biggest one yet, and didn’t sell a cent.
Keep the faith!

Super exciting to see BTC getting mainstream media coverage here in Aus.

Dips aren’t a bad time to buy!

Got plenty of money, just not enough to buy somewhere to live in a housing market ruined by baby boomer and foreign investors

Am in the same predicament. God knows if i start day trading what the fuck I’m supposed to do

The correction was so damn fast. People are constantly waiting in the wings to buy big on dips

Hurstville? Saw something similar there a month or so ago

Vegeta! What does the scouter say about the price of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:59:12
Maybe where you’re from. Cash is already swiftly becoming a thing of the past in Australia. The adoption of contactless card payments everywhere in a society that doesn’t tip means we’re heading wellllll away from cash.

Millibits or Millicoins would sound better
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:21:35
If everyone who was thinking about bitcoin went ahead and did so, the price would surge dramatically and everyone would make money.
Now is always a good time. Buy now, tell everyone you know about bitcoin, and then hold.

Sounds like a Batman villain. ‘The Hodler’.
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:54:06
Good answer, thanks. It’s pretty cool to think that bitcoin has the potential to become a truly universal currency.
@_date: 2017-10-30 12:35:47
What kind of device did you screenshot it using? 
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:51:52
So what you’re saying is that the anonymity of BTC is worth more to some people than some loss of value in their holdings?
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:50:09
That’s a good point. Makes sense that now is a great time for merchants to adopt. Hopefully this means the amount of merchants then starts to increase dramatically, pushing us further and further towards the moon.
