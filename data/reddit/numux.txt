No... I would say GDAX / Coinbase crapped out because I wasn't even able to log into the sites. I would enter my credentials and it would either drop me back to the log in page or present an error with no details that said the site owner was made aware of the problem.

I fail to see how a government would even exist or operate without taxes. I would not trust privatized roads without some sort of higher oversight. Charter schools are mostly a mess and private prisons reward finding people to arrest, basically filling seats like it was some sort of stadium.
The way you describe this you are looking more for an anarchist society which will just turn into a corporate run world (if we don't already have that) with no government. A completely different extreme.
I do not understand how everyone jumps to the worst parts of socialism and communism whenever this stuff is brought up. Maybe just maybe we can all think logically and reasonably for a minute and pull the best working parts for each form of government and weave together a new government based on good ideas instead of leading with a few of those ideas and carrying over all of the bad shit. I'm not even saying that is what should happen with the US. But why is it that every time any progressive idea is brought up we think it can't work without all of the bad stuff following? Understand why those bad components occur and factor that in to the program. Nothing is black and white but our current political system forces you to believe it is us vs them in every aspect.

And here I just thought they were just taking money from the people who aren't paying their fair share like the rest of us. Let's just let Amazon claim they owe $0 in taxes again. Not to mention reallocating a portion of our bloated high waste military budget. Or even have people opt out of current well fair programs if they want to get $1000 a month.

You are adding more to this than there is. Just because China may or may not be pursuing a UBI has nothing to do with a US implementation of it. Andrew Yang specifically refers to this as capitalism that doesn't start at zero. Already our government takes money from everyone for "the greater good". I am all for scaling down some of that or at least reducing administrative waste in the process. But I am for better future proofing our society and jobs will be harder and harder to find in the coming decade. I happen to work in a field that won't be automated away any time soon but I can still see how this effects others.

Watch his Joe Rogan interview. He is pretty solid on other subjects too. I like that he actually has answers with numbers and studies to back up what he is saying. Not just abstract politician talk with uncertainties and lack of understanding in a subject.

Use Credit Unions. Major banks are all thieves.
@_date: 2019-03-17 00:22:21
That is a big over simplification. UBI does not equal communism.
Edit: where the money will come from:
Sure, it isn't air tight and not everyone will agree on all aspects of this. It still isn't communism.

I think the mistake was she pulled thousands out at a time not too far apart from each other...... and that she uses BOA. But really why not just use a debit card for all of that? Why pull out large sums of cash?

I see they will want proof of the coins. Any idea how that will be accomplished? I THINK I still have my old wallet it was sent from but my proof was on the damn MtGox servers under my account. Hopefully they can use this and as long as I give my user name and proof I created that account will be enough.

Seriously. I used to work for a company doing remote support for SANs. JPM would open tickets with some middle man support desk who knew nothing about their infrastructure basically just passing on a request from some internal IT techs. Every week or two they would open a case to have performance checked out. I would do a general check and not see anything glaring and the ask what host ports and luns are seeing the issue. It would take them days to get that information and once they did I could look deeper at the flow of data. Everything was working fine on our side but there were always host ports completely at 100% usage. I would always tell them they need to spread out the workload to other ports or reduced what is being sent. They would ask some confused questions and close the case.
A week or so later here comes another case for the same issue. I just started looking at the same ports and asking if those are the problem. I would see no new ports are mapped to that host and the same problem exists. Over and over. It got to the point where they might as well open a case with the subject "Had this problem last week. I changed nothing and it is still broken. Help."

Maybe they really just needed time to implement and test it? I've seen far simpler features on products released by established companies cause some big headaches. BTC is getting enough BS lately the last thing we all need is one of the larger exchanges (however much they are hated) to have any transaction problems or security breaches.

(Being deliberately vague) I've been fighting with getting various Microsoft products (some cloud solutions) to work together for a few months now with a product I work on. All of their shit is garbage. They can't make any of their shit work in the slightest non sterile environment. Their tech support is useless and my engineers can run circles around them. I can do all of this shit in Linux so easily and for free. Fuck Microsoft.

I am not aware of one but someone might be tracking that. I'm not sure how easy that would be even if you were able to analyze the blockchain and make an educated guess. Who is to say how many wallets are owned by the same people. You could try to go by exchange numbers when they do publicly state how many new accounts they have but even then, I am on multiple exchanges so once again how many new users are already accounted for elsewhere.
Looking at some stats like this: 
You see that in the last 24 hours the BTC equivalent of $1.4 billion USD was traded. I would say easily 10's of millions of people actively using Bitcoin. But really I am tossing numbers around with very little data to match it to.

Minidisks were around a long time before MP3 took off. Personal minidisks players may have been pushed a bit just before all of the MP3 players came to market but it was just a tough sell when CD-R's were getting much cheaper and everyone had a drive that could read and write to them. I do remember Sony releasing a Minidisk player that you could load MP3's to which I think at the time was the best use for them given the market.

I'm doing a small mining operation and during the dip I am breaking even leaning to a slight loss. I'm still mining full force since I can float the costs for now. If I need some extra cash to cover costs I will sell some but for now all of my earnings are being held. If enough of us do that then this should also help the price as new BTC is not as readily available. But the general idea is that although I may have been mining at $6000 USD, if the price doubles and then I sell, it will be the same as mining at $12k to $14k the whole time.

It was competing against a superior format which still is around today, Blu-ray. All of the examples given in the picture were just people bashing early versions of a better product before they matured.

An interesting comparison. HD DVD was being pushed by a few companies and advertised hard. The problem was anyone who knew anything about the two standards understood Blu-ray was a better tech yet the marketing was behind HD DVD. Sort of like USD is being marketed and pushed by a corrupt government and a central bank. Meanwhile BTC is being pushed by the people.

But the fees are based on the data size of the transaction correct? SegWit reduces the data size which will keep fees more manageable from that end. Lightening network my understanding can handle many (thousands?) of micro transactions per single on chain transaction. While this is not the batching most people talk about from the exchange side it is still a form of batching many transactions into one. While there could still be many opportunities for optimizing transaction fees, this should allow a significant amount of more transactions for cheaper than what was seen in December.
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:36:04
How so?
@_date: 2018-04-06 17:29:29
SegWit and Lightning would buffer this effect, no?

The same hardware is still running at the same hash rate as before the difficulty drop. This means any miners still in the game are getting higher rewards for the same work they have been doing all along.
