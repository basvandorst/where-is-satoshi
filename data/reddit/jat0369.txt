Hi there self-promoter!

Sorry. Posted it as I got it. The link below has more clarification.

eBay literally JUST took down all my auctions because I simply mentioned I'd accept bit coin as payment. Fuck that.  
@_date: 2014-07-08 18:07:21
Shoot me an email or msg when you do. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 05:06:43

Not saying I support or believe this, but I wanted to share with the community. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 18:09:50
I previously got about 30 of those emails simply because I put I accept bitcoin. I'm not mad about that. Simply put, that circumvents their little ebay--&gt;paypal monopoly they've got going on. My beef currently is that I'm not selling concurrency.

I went to Vegas a few months back for CA world 2013. My wife and I thought the D was one of the best hotels out there. We had a great experience there.  I'm planning to take my earnings from this month and take my wife there simply because they take bitcoin now.  Well done.
**TLDR: My wife wants the D.**

Isn't dogecoin going through this right now? 
One of the entire premises of bitcoin and the economics surrounding it is the fact that it's a deflationary currency. If ANY market cap was increased, it would defeat the entire premise it was founded on. 
1. The price would tank with people pulling out of the market entirely. Thus killing the vaule of the currency. 
2. It'd be no better than fiat as far as inflation and intrinsic value. Again, people would pull out of the market due to lack of faith in the currency. 
Think of it this way...for every bitcoin that's lost, the bitcoin you own is worth more now!

Offering the customer a different option. 
No worries. I needed to edit the auctions anyways. Gives me more motivation to do so.

OSX/Safari - I was able to replicate it. It's due to the number of featured Items. I'll limit it to 4 and see if that resolves the issue. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-07-08 18:08:44
I know. It makes perfect sense to set a keyword and block it. However, what gets my goat is the calling customer service, having no one competent enough to understand what I'm calling about and getting transferred multiple times with no resolution whatsoever. 
ugh! I'm sure I'll get over it.

I kid you not....I can do this for you.

I have no problem accepting dogecoin, reddcoin, litecoin, etc. 
I need to work on getting the interface up to accept those crypto-currencies. In the meantime, if anyone wanted to make a deal, I would recommend you contact me directly.

It's more about the convention crowd more than bitcoin folk in general.

Until the price stabalizes, it doesn't make sense for **anyone** to statically set a price in bitcoin.

You'll make more money simply investing in BTC, however if you insist on mining, I'd suggest you look into joining a co-op or group buy. That's where you can make the best ROI with limited capital.

You want to know my password? Sorry, even I don't know it. 
I use [LastPass]( Most badass password management tool in history. It's free, but the premium is $12 a year. That's right...just a DOLLAR a month.
Combined with the [YubiKey]( that I use for LastPass, and my 2-factor on my online-wallets. I feel pretty good about my online security.
**Seriously folks. Check out [LastPass and YubiKey]( They have a special for $33 bucks that includes  Lastpass Premium for a year and the yubikey. It's worth just the peace of mind.**

They're being "assholes" because you're not providing  the required documentation? Give it a break. You're not providing what they're asking for. 
I wouldn't expect your BTC to be gone forever. I'd work on getting your account verified by having your parents transfer a bill into your name so that you can have a proof of residency. Or just hold and wait till your 16. You have plenty of time. Don't cash out your .35btc just yet.

So let's say I'm from the USA. When trying to add a withdraw method then select Bank Transfer, which one do I select next? IBAN, SWIFT/BIC, ABA, or BSD? (BSB Australia &amp; Japanese Domestic Transfer obviously excluded) I've entered my account number in each, but nothing seems to work.

I just have issue with "most certainly determine if bitcoin is a long term success". You're making it seem that youthful adoption rates are imperative in the success of bitcoin.
Adoption in any demographic is helpful, but not necessarily imperative for success or failure.
Polident, Bengay, and AM talk radio aren't successful because all the kids are using them. :)

Honest answer...no one TRULY knows. 
Most likely they won't provide a ROI anytime soon. However, if/when bitcoin reaches 5k,10k, etc...they'd more than return on your investment. 
I personally would pass on them at the moment. If you insist on block erupts..., youu'd make a better profit if you resold them to people on ebay.

Mining has gone to the point where you'd need a dedicated machine specifically designed to mine bitcoin. A good bitcoin miner is not cheap (aka 5000+). 
However you seem like you just want some hobby rig. Check out the [adafruit raspberry pi bitcoin miner.]( **IT WILL NOT RETURN ON YOUR INVESTMENT,** but it's fun to play with.
