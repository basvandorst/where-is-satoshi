Then why did you use it?
@_date: 2018-08-06 23:38:36
I’m fine with that. Seeing as most people don’t, contrary to your opinion.

Oh wow, how very impressive. Don't worry, the rest of us retards will continue looking to you educated people for guidance and wisdom.
What a fucking joke.

You act like it's not normal for someone to be unaware of finance jargon...

Dw, so did almost everyone else.

Yeah, which is why I learned what it meant when I was first looking into crypto. What’s so hard to get about this?
@_date: 2018-08-05 10:28:38
First time I heard the term fiat I was confused about what crypto had to do with cars.
Edit: To all the people commenting trying to educate me on what fiat means. I know what it means now, as clearly indicated by the fact that I said "First time," I was implying that since then I learned what it meant.

This sub needs to realise that other crypto’s aren’t the enemy by default.

Dude, it’s not a term in most people’s vocabulary. Most people aren’t into finance and economy, and fiat is a niche, jargon term. To most people, the concept of ‘currency’ pertains almost entirely to fiat currency. The reason I found out about it after I found out about the term ‘cryptocurrency,’ was that prior to learning of cryptocurrency I had zero need for a word to distinguish my everyday dollars from an entirely different form of currency.
How you can think fiat is a common term is beyond me. In what context would you ever use that word in everyday conversation?
@_date: 2018-08-06 00:48:12
Name one context in which a layman would use the term. Better yet, go and find people you know who aren’t into crypto and ask them what fiat means. I guarantee you that they will either say they don’t know, or that it’s a car brand.
It may not be a finance term per se but ‘fiat currency’ (which is what everyone here means when they say ‘fiat’) is, and I would definitely say it is up there with the other terms you named in opposition to it.
I don’t know why you keep trying to argue this point seeing as everyone seems to disagree with you. Surely the fact that popular opinion is against you indicates that it is not a well known term at all.

What does this have to do with reddit?
@_date: 2018-06-15 08:35:00
I mean I get the we all hate ver and that bch keeps trying to trick people into thinking its Bec, but I fail to see how it’s doing worse than some the other coins this algorithm approves of.

It’s over $10,000 in my country (Australia). Time to follow through.

Oh I wasn’t trying to agree with the sentiment that our generation is somehow not capable of that sort of event or something, just that I don’t think the two are very comparable. Yes crypto is very cool and revolutionary in a countercultural sort of way, but the moon landing was more of a magical sort of thing. But yeah, if/when we do get to mars that would be a pretty amazing thing to look back on.
@_date: 2018-07-22 12:29:26
Either that or we’re in for one hell of a bear market.
@_date: 2018-07-24 11:10:19
Yeah I was gonna say, crypto is awesome and all but launching some men through space and sending hem to the moon is fucking magical.
@_date: 2018-07-07 02:33:27
This is bad. You talk about inflation in fiat, and then when you get to Bitcoin you mention a bunch of facts that have nothing to do with inflation. It feels like you’re comparing apples and oranges.

Good point hahaha.
