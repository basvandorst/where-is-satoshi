This is the time where the floor of btc will be formed since a lot of people are having the same sentiments.

Do this and you will get killed, at least here in the Philippines.

You're referring to blockchain technology as irreplaceable rather than bitcoin dont you think?

And how can i get the tx size. Is that the amount of btc im going to send? But it doesnt make sense because tx fee is fixed no matter how much you send right?
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:46:11

@_date: 2018-01-09 05:01:52

you're defining what hodlers mean but what Im asking is how did OP know that hodlers increase by the day? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:30:32
Why would they do that? Why does it have to be on january and not on december?
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:52:29
Okay I think his mistake was he didnt mention that there are hodlers who sold their bitcoins. His statement made it look like there are more and more hodlers each day but that could not be true if some hodlers sold their bitcoin and bought alt coins.

"I don’t see it a wise choice should they throw it under the bus- such would be blatant depriving of freedoms- and unless we want a society like North Korea, freedom fighters will struggle to maintain their perceived right to hold currency." What if they dont care about our freedom which is most likely the case, then it can happen.
