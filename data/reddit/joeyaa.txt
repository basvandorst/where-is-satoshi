I really didn't like coinbase - that is probably the only exchange I would actively not want to use again.

They emailed me back saying that they cannot set up a bank account while I am resident in another country.  I guess their page just doesn't give this message automatically after you submit it.

Asking for an exchange that works for folks living abroad makes someone a troll.  Interesting stuff, bitcoin forum!

I tried to set up an account using a Thai phone number and that is where I got brick walled.  I don't have a US phone number to use for this.

I never said I don't have a valid bank account?
I have a wells fargo account in the USA but am an expat.  I have 9k of bitcoin and want to send it to wells fargo.  I got a new phone number and the normal exchange I use does not work anymore, they had not updated the phone number in days.  I ask for a suggestion and bitcoiners melt down a bit and claim that the story is extremely far fetched and hard to believe.  They also still don't seem to acknowledge that the other exchanges they are suggesting don't actually work due to residency requirements.

My bitcoins are not currently on coinbase and never said they were.
I have some bitcoin and I want to quickly and safely be able to get them to the USA no later than the 15th.  I think where I failed was thinking that bitcoin was actually going to be easier/cheaper for me to use than just wiring the money from my foreign bank to US bank.

Am I understanding it right that it is only .45% to chance BTC &gt; USD and then USD &gt; Bank is free?  That is cheap!
Edit: Well I am getting my identity verified on there ATM.  Hopefully once it is I can get this transferred easily.
Also my buddy just set up a coinbase account and sent 3k home and they said it will only take 2 business days max now (down from 5 when I used it).  So hopefully they update my phone number and I can use them if this doesn't pan out.
Thanks for the suggestion BTW, uphold definitely seems to be working very well so far.
Alright just another update:  My identify verification went very fast but when I try to add a bank I put in the details and it doesn't say if it actually accepted my information.  It does say that within 3-5 business days I will have two small transactions hit the account which I should then enter.  But the site doesn't seem to be registering that I've actually tried to add the account.  I've tried a few times now...

I can easily convert it back to USD in a number of ways.  The problem is that (it seems) I cannot easily convert bitcoin to Wells Fargo at all.  Just so it might make more sense to you: I play poker from abroad and don't normally send USD to America.
Why can't someone just give me a way to actually send my bitcoin to America?  If asking for that makes someone a troll bitcoin has some pretty serious issues and I hope UCY.

I used coinbase in the past every time but now that my phone number has changed it isn't really a viable option at the moment.
Also isn't the point of bitcoin to be so easy to use that people can do something as simple as a bank transfer seemlessly?  If not, why the heck wouldn't I have just asked my foreign bank to wire the money for me?

The website that deals with bitcoin is ultimately trying to test your residency, though.  The middle man between actually using bitcoin for most real world transactions requires this.  The only other option is to trust some sketchy/random middle man though a site like localbitcoin and that seems rather crappy.  Would you want to trust some random party with 9k?  I'd rather do business with a large organization that has to worry about its long term reputation.
I also don't really want to start falsifying documents when dealing with large financial transactions.  I am not a lawyer and can't be sure about the legal ramifications of doing that.
Luckily I have a coin base account set up from a couple of years ago and it worked fine.  I am suspicious that if I was a new customer and tried to set it up again they would ask me about residency though, considering a couple of other exchanges have that requirement.

I tried several different exchanges and they do not work mostly for the reason that I am not resident in the USA.  It you have not actually been on the other side of this I guess you might not realize that so many sites turn you down based on this.

I am buying a condo and do not have the option of "staying in bitcoin".

Are you serious?  How is that not the most obvious thing in the world.
My post was asking people the best way to convert BTC to USD bank while living abroad.  A few guys responded with exchange suggestions.  Then I pointed out that they (Gemini and Uphold) do not actually work for people in my situation.  One guy suggested that I message coinbase support, which actually worked to solve the problem (their automated way of changing phone number was taking forever).
I guess people don't realize that many exchanges that withdraw to US banks aren't so useful to folks living outside the USA because they've never done it before.
Also lol at the whole thread calling someone a troll for asking for an exchange or other method and seemingly nobody actually having one on hand to suggest people outside of the USA to use.

There are never horror stories of, say, a person getting BTC from a new user and then reversing the bank payment later (ala a paypal scam)?  Can a wells fargo transfer be reversed?
@_date: 2016-02-01 04:23:34
This is making me quite reluctant to use local bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-01 06:28:08
It doesn't say that they actually accepted anything, it just goes back to the form very quickly.  I also did not receive an email or confirmation in any other way.  Normally when you submit details like this pretty much any other website will take you to a new page and send you confirmation.
Anyway I tried 3 times, two in same browser and third time in new browser.  Hopefully it works but I kind of doubt it is working properly.

I have never used localbitcoin before.  You don't have to be physically located in the country to sell there?  I always thought it was a method to meet people face to face to sell.  If not, how does it work exactly?  I will have an account with 0 feedback and am rather worried about dealing with p2p stuff as I don't want to get scammed.
@_date: 2016-02-01 08:41:52
Boom you won the thread!  I waited for a few days without a response from the automated system.  Coinbase (and authy) staff responded within hours.
Looks like I have a reasonable way of selling bitcoin again.

5 is too little IMO for attempting to pay for multiple murders.  I think 10-15 is probably the most reasonable.  If it was just the drug market he shouldn't be in prison at all though... a victimless crime isn't actually a crime.
