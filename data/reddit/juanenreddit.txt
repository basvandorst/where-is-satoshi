Bitcoin do nothing, people do.

Ethereum, you think in future. Good project. But I don't understantd why hold ethereum and Litecoin. Ethereum is best project than Litecoin. Ethereum can be used like coin and like DAPPS. Litecoin is limited.

Does this give you confidence?

That is like I want to modify Ubuntu because I think I can do better, but I don't talk with Ubuntu comunity. I make a Ubuntu fork. That will not be the problem if I call my distribution with other name. The problem is when I name my distribution Ubuntu Gold or other to take advantage of Ubuntu name
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:18:39
Now, they have to talk about IOTA ������

But we have the same problem, true Bitcoin is not updating its technology. Today, Bitcoin has  worse technology than ethereum. While Ethereum is updating its technology, Bitcoin is making shitcoins. This is crazy, and it seems that the community behind Bitcoin seems fine. Time to time

A normal correction in a bull market. We already expected it

Futures are legal and regulated instruments, Bitcoin is not regulated or legal. Regulated enterprises can't offers Bitcoin to theirs clients, but they want to earn money with Bitcoin,in fact they want to ear money with all.  Futures are like a bet in which your bets on how much Bitcoin will be worth in the future. Futures are regulated and legal, and actually they are the way of an legal an regulated enterprise of make legal money with Bitcoin. But futures don't affect directly to Bitcoin, in fact bank or edge funds don't buy Bitcoin. They are like casino playing which horse arrive first.

BCH is one BitCopyAltcoin manipulated for one group of miners, influencers and whales. They are cowards, if they wanted to have made a good fork could have done as Dash or Litecoin, with their own identity. But they have only taken advantage of the name since BCH technological level is worse than Dash or Litecoin
@_date: 2017-11-05 10:49:35
That is not true. Bitcoin has a lot of problems of scalability and fees costs. It is necessary to update its technology but Bitcoin comunity are making forks, and Bitcoin technology is not being updated. By other hand there are one miners war. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 10:53:58
I believe in Bitcoins forks like Litecoin or Dash. But this kind of forks are not the same and they are mining confidence in Bitcoin. Price go up, but this people don't are holders, they are going to leave Bitcoin and then why, same outdated technology and a lot of coins with the name of Bitcoin.

Utilities criptos like Ether or golem or others utilities have natural value. But bitcoin don't have its own utility. It has value because people think that bitcoin has value.

Sorry I'm not English speaker and I wrote fast without notice. Thanks for the correction. I wanted to say loser. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 20:42:42
Of course. Loser is someone who don't believe in Bitcoin and sell in panic. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:38:21
I fixed it

They were going to be the country that was going to hold all these new SheepCoins like BitcoinGold Bitcoin2x and a lot of the Ethereum SuperUltraPower coins. Now we are lost

That is the beginning of the end. Kazakhstan can dump Bitcoin world. I let here new. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 16:06:43
I think ethereum is not a clon, Dapps are news. And Iota is new technology based on the Tangle. Not all altcoins are the same. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 04:55:33
I agree 
@_date: 2017-10-24 16:09:40
OK, we have to copy dolar. I think satoshi would be proud.

Beautiful city and crypto friendly 
@_date: 2017-10-24 16:01:20
When I saw this gif it reminded me of Bitcoin. I don't know why. Can you give me a reason? 
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:19:26
I don't sleep, Kazakhstan is going to destroy Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:23:55
What scam? I don't named any coin. In fact I wrote it as an example of this crazy bitcoins forks. And it is real that people had that intention. In my opinion is the same SACAM like Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Cash and all bitcoins copycoins. I think one Bitcoin is enough and if someone want to earn money with a crypto, he must to invent him own name.
