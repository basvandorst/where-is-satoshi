Oh god that is beautiful.

This is a semi-anonymous message board/content aggregator, perhaps you meant to type facebook.com in your address bar? We all make mistakes.

That ship has sailed a while ago IMO.

The market cap is not even remotely comparable. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:41:43
When it hits 1USD?
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:43:29
It's still better to lose 12k than 19k per coin.
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:28:07
HODL for another pump cycle! What could go wrong?
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:04:46
Back when the market cap was worth less than Bill Gates? Regardless, the past is meaningless.

It is very different actually. If a News organization gets caught selling airtime, they will lose everything. Not saying it never happens but it's stupid to think they do it all the time.
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:32:39
Log is completely useless.


It's obviously greater, orders of magnitude greater. What matters is the market cap right now.

He who do not fear the long arm of the regulator is a fool.

Tomorrow as people try to liquidate their mining rigs.

What does it matter if the account is a day old?
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:12:48


Yes, actually it does.


You just answered your own question.
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:36:08
Says the guy who wastes his time looking at a posting history in reddit, that's just sad.
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:27:04
And it's back!
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:48:48


Oh god I remember that clown from the gold scam craze of 2008... 
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:05:42
Wow, you're not the sharpest pencil in the box... Yeah, it's the one that was banned, it is clearly not banned anymore.
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:11:15
I would prefer if Reddit didn't have comment history, visible karma or even visible account names.
 
Then we wouldn't have to deal with this shit or doxxing. There are more people calling other people shills than actual shills.
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:28:38
$500 perhaps.
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:50:31


I almost spewed out my coffee. Maybe another cryptocurrency will rise eventually but bitcoin is dead.


Regulators see it for what it is, an unnecessary speculative bubble and will kill it by any means necessary. The writing is on the wall.
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:13:30
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:45:47


That would be the top of the proverbial pyramid... 
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:40:43


You should seek help.

The more you zoom out the worse it looks, be my guest and make another one.
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:00:53
I have had reddit accounts since the Digg migration. It's best to evaluate comments on their merit.
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:39:47
See, your main mistake was trying to explain the wrong definition of what a market cap is. Nobody thinks the market cap represent the "real" value of BTC, which is obviously orders of magnitude lower as the price is heavily inflated. It represent the current value of BTC.




@_date: 2018-02-06 17:02:20
I would honestly just cut my losses at this point. I wish you luck.
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:15:55
Speaking of perspective.
