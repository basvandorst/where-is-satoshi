Thanks for sharing the joy! A quarter to you!

Yeah I was wondering about that too. Couldn't you link circle to your two bank accounts and withdraw from one account, convert to bitcoin then immediately withdraw top your other account?

That was nice of you. Quarter for you! @_date: 2014-11-07 01:15:11
I'll buy that for a quarter @_date: 2015-01-21 03:19:05
I don't understand how transactions on the overstock stock market are written to the bitcoin block chain.

I don't agree with the article's point about bitcoin not having value etc. 
But I do think it is a good idea to distance bitcoin from the idea that it is just a investment platform.  It is a currency and therefore stability is the ultimate goal.

So does that mean there is some amount of bitcoin being transferred? I assume at the minimum there would have to be a mining fee from somewhere.

Aren’t you buying bitcoin with fiat? So what are the people selling the bitcoin going to do with the profits? Destroy their profits in protest to destabilize the banking system or put their profits straight back into the system by buying stuff?

How does this work? Could you give an hypothetical example?

I was excited when I saw the headline only to realize that it wasn't about T-Mobile America.

Really want to watch this episode. 
I was planning to try living off Bitcoin for a month and doing a video diary. Though I had a few hurdles I haven't been able to solve. One was how to pay housing fees, if I lived at home. One option was to stay at a hotel that accepts Bitcoin payments but that would have gotten expensive fast. Another hurdle was how to pay for automobile fuel. I tried Gyft to buy a gas gift card through Bitcoin but they didn't sell gift cards for gas stations. The experiment would be moot if I just used a bitcoin backed debit card.
