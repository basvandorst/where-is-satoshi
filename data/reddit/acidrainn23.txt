so if I want to move a balance from one wallet to another should I go off the fees listed online ~190 satoshis/byte?
A few days ago I remember reading posts about transactions going through for &lt;100satoshis per byte  
Is that still a thin?

Given the high fees (at the moment), and long transaction times.  
Would it be that bad of an idea to store some btc on an exchange (coinbase/gdax)?  
I'm not talking about a lot, just enough that I might wanna sell if price hit a certain point,  
Normally I wouldn't consider keeping my coins on an exchange,  
but with these long transaction times I feel like moving coins offline, onto an exchange, to the sell might create too long of a time-dely in terms to responding to a price change
Is this all around ill-advised, or has anyone considered keeping a bit of coin 'liquid' on an exchange 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:48:00
but uhhh, how does that translate into Lambo's 
jk, thats actually really interesting  
I'm only wondering if those institutions handling such a massive amounts of pensions (income people rely on), will be willing to move that money into bitcoin given how volatile its been
Entire pensions fluctuating as dramatically as bitcoin does might not be appealing to people who truly have to make ends meet using those funds 
I'll fully admit that I dont really know anything about pensions, or how they work, so I may be mistaken in thinking of them in similar terms as a retirement fund

1. Have access to your private keys before fork  
2. Transfer BTC to a new wallet  
3. Import your now-empty wallets seed/private words to a BCC wallet  
4. ??????  
5. Profit 
@_date: 2017-08-03 01:16:24
How'd you do the sweep into coinomi?  
I'm currently moving BTC from one wallet to a new one (I'm using electrum), just waiting on confirmations.  
When that's done do I  
Enter my electrum recovery phrase to *Restore a Wallet* within coinomi,   
or  
Do I open the BitcoinCash tab &amp; select *Sweep Wallet* and enter my phrase there?  
@_date: 2017-08-05 07:16:16
So do you use the Btc or the Bch bathroom?

how's electron cash working, and what wallet did you have your BTC in?  
Im using electrum and thinking about using either Electron or Coinomi to store the BCH  
I was waiting for Kraken to open BCH trading but from my understanding all that stuff is moving really slow

*"I'll sleep when I'm Seg-d"*
@_date: 2017-08-03 04:53:34
ok, yeah I've had no luck trying to use my seed phrase.  
So, I can export the private keys using electrum in either a .csv file or .json.  
What exactly comes next?   
@_date: 2018-10-18 05:52:00
Whats the move for low/no fee cashouts?  
I transferred my coinbase balance to coinbase pro(gdax),   
im gonna transfer a bit more from a wallet I have, i guess thats just straightforward and i pay the regular network fees  
Then from coinbase pro I can sell as a maker(?) at current price for no fee
Then transfer the cash accordingly   
  
is that about right?
thanks

Dang, i wonder why it says "could not recognize the private key format".  
Maybe it'd be easier to use Electron Wallet but that seems sketchy so far
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:49:25
When you restore the seed does the new wallet automatically show the right balance in BCH or does it take a while?

Yeah, exactly the same  
The second row of numbers where the ones that I was able to use to generate the QR codes (none of these started with 5, maybe they're different for each of us).  
I double and triple checked each time I had manually keyed in the private keys but had no luck, upon closer look I see the QR codes WERE actually identical to the private keys so   
Perhaps I was making a mistake in capitalization or something
@_date: 2017-08-04 16:38:39
what if Bcash goes to like *a billion dollars*, then what?
@_date: 2017-08-03 06:05:37
I think I got it, what helped was generating a QR code from the private keys I was receiving from electrum.  
Interestingly, the code that was read from the QR codes did not match the private keys I was given, but did retrieve the appropriate balances.  
Weird huh

I guess I have 43 private keys, would the last used be the one at the top of the list?  
I've had the wallet for a while and mostly deposited into it, the last transaction would be moving the balance to a new wallet

@_date: 2017-08-03 05:18:20
wow I feel kinda clueless lol, I appreciate the help.  
I'm guessing I can open the transaction details for the transfers that went to the new wallet (one $1 test transfer followed by a bulk move), I do see that some of the strings under "input" match some of the private keys so I think thats what I'm looking for.  
So do I create a new wallet, add BitcoinCash, sweep wallet, then add the matching private keys? 
@_date: 2017-08-03 05:53:32
No, none start with 5, no spaces either.  Mostly L's and K's
On the private key export file i get an addresses and a private keys column.  
I tried entering just the private keys, the address with a space then the private keys, then both address and keys without a space

thats kinda along the lines of what im thinking.  
Im a believer in bitcoin, and im down with the whole HODL community
but wouldnt taking a profit, and buying back in cheaper be the more logical financial move?  
Timing the market is a b!tch, but aside from that I would have been more than happy to have cashed out at the ATH, then bought back in with a way bigger position with todays price

There's no saftey to think about if you own your own private keys.  
You wouldn't leave cash in a piggy bank as it would be smartest/safest to deposit it directly into your bank.  
With Bitcoin you are your own bank, if you own your own keys then you don't have to worry.  
Letting your coins sit in an exchange is like leaving them in a piggy bank.

@_date: 2017-07-31 07:44:36
I don't have the link, but electrum has a post with the instructions on what to do for the split.  
Hopefully somebody here can clarify a bit better, but from my understanding after the fork you create another wallet and transfer your btc to that new wallet.  
After that you use the seed words from your now empty wallet and after you restore them you will have bcc.  
I could never wrong about the exact steps, but that's more or less what I understand
