I recommend you check out the open source website for bitcoin at [ for a general overview of bitcoin.
As for a wallet, it depends on what level of security you want, and what you access the wallet with (iPhone, Android Phone, hardware wallet, Mac, Windows, etc.) I have a few recommendations.
- Bread Wallet on iOS: perfect if you also want to run your own node. This is an SPV (simplified payment verification) wallet that allows you to control which Full Node you interface with. Great for beginners and advanced users alike, by far one of the most secure.
- Trust Wallet on iOS: Best if you want to hold Ethereum and other ERC-20 Tokens, or if you want Native segwit addresses for bitcoin (aka cheaper fees if you send to other addresses starting with “bc1”). Also very secure but in my opinion not as beginner friendly.
- Electrum on PC: By far one of the most superior desktop wallets out there, very secure and open source. Electrum has been around for a very long time and has maintained a lot of respect from the community.
- Ledger Nano S or X: This is a hardware wallet, meaning it’s a physical device that stores your private keys (the numbers that allow you to spend your bitcoin). The device is only used to sign a transaction, aka to use your coins. The device generates a backup seed phrase from its own internal hardware and never directly interfaces with the internet. Perfect for long-term, or even just paranoid storage.
For buying bitcoin, if you live in the US the Cash App by Square allows you to instantly buy bitcoin (for a slight markup in price). The benefits is that you can transfer bitcoin OUT of the Cash App into a wallet you control for free, and it’s instant.
Alternatively if you can wait a week or so for your money to be sent over to the exchange before you buy or withdraw your bitcoin, albeit for cheaper/lower fees, use [Coinbase Pro](  (owned by same company, uses same login as Coinbase but with lower fees, and literally no reason to not use it). You can transfer Fiat to Coinbase Pro and (after 3-7 days) buy bitcoin at market price with very very low fees, and can also withdraw bitcoin for free to a wallet you control.
@_date: 2019-07-07 23:50:17
I recommend Bread if you are on iOS as unfortunately Mycelium on iOS is really glitchy and not maintained. Android version of Mycelium is great though because it gives you manual fee control.
If you want native segwit bitcoin addresses and also store ERC-20 tokens (that use the ethereum blockchain) use Trust wallet.

TL;DR: A Transaction Input is what reveals your public key, not the Transaction Output, and an address represents the **hash** of a Public Key.
UTXOs that are [P2PKH](  (Pay to Pub Key Hash) go to the hash of a public key. More specifically, the following script, known as the scriptPubKey, is pushed onto a stack:
OP_DUP OP_HASH160 &lt;PubKeyHash&gt; OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
These operations define how the coins are allowed to be spent. OP_DUP = Duplicate the top item of the stack, OP_HASH160 = Popping the top of the stack and pushing the RIPEMD-160 hash of the SHA-256 hash of the popped data back onto the stack, &lt;PubKeyHash&gt; = Pushing the recipient’s decoded Address onto the stack, OP_EQUALVERIFY = checking if the top two values on the stack are equal and popping them if true, and OP_CHECKSIG = checks if the signature is verified by the public key on the stack (more on this later). For more information, check the bitcoin wiki’s section on [bitcoin script](
A [legacy bitcoin address](  (beginning with a 1) is just a public key hash that is encoded in Base58 with a version byte (0x00) prepended, and a checksum appended to the end. To convert an address to a PubKeyHash is as simple as decoding from Base58.
However, when a UTXO is Spent, the spender must prove ownership by providing some additional values to satisfy the UTXO’s scriptPubKey. This combination of values is known as the scriptSig, and for P2PKH consists of two parts:
&lt;[Signature]( &lt;Public Key&gt; 
When a [Transaction]( is evaluated and verified, the input’s scriptSig and the scriptPubKey of the output it’s spending are placed onto a stack so the whole thing becomes:
&lt;Signature&gt; &lt;Public Key&gt; OP_DUP OP_HASH160 &lt;PubKeyHash&gt; OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
First, the signature is pushed to the stack. Then the public key associated with the bitcoin address. OP_DUP duplicates the public key, OP_HASH160 pops the public key off the stack and pushes the hash of the public key onto the stack. Then the PubKeyHash whom the coins belongs to is pushed to the stack. Then OP_EQUALVERIFY checks to see if the public key does indeed hash to the specified PubKeyHash. If true, the two values are popped off the stack. Then OP_CHECKSIG takes the last two elements from the stack (the signature and the unhashed public key) and checks if the signature is valid. If true, the input is valid and “unlocks” the UTXO for spending.
This is a big part of why you should not reuse addresses: only when you **SPEND** a UTXO do you reveal your Public Key to the world. Until spent, your public key is secured behind other barriers (SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160). If Elliptic Curve cryptography is to be broken by quantum computers, it will also need to break the hashing algorithms above as well to at least invalidate P2PKH outputs. Back in the very early days, some Outputs were made using P2PK (Pay to Pub Key) which does not use this intermediary hashing technique and is considered far less secure, thus it is rarely used today if at all.

So... they produced an invalid block, but was this block added to the chain and deemed valid by other nodes?
@_date: 2019-07-11 20:57:22
You can do this. I like the idea and it’s what I do sometimes as well if I’m buying bitcoin in bulk then buying other alts with the bitcoin before transferring to my own wallets.
Totally okay. But you’ll have to wait 6 confirmations before withdrawing to your native segwit wallet, as that’s how long Coinbase takes to consider a transaction valid.

First off, you say this is America but you’re on the Internet right now pal. Not everyone lives in America. 
Secondly, you’re asking if bitcoin becomes the DOMINANT CURRENCY (meaning things aren’t valued in USD, they are valued in BITCOIN). Therefore we would use more rounded, easy to understand numbers like what we currently do with USD. Your bill might be 4500 sats, or 1.5 mBTC, etc. You seem to be caught up with converting USD to bitcoin, when in actuality and even today the exchange price varies every single second so your bill could be ₿0.0052700 when you start eating but be ₿ 0.0052604 when you finish. This is because you’re valuing the bill in USD then into bitcoin, and not valuing the bill in bitcoin.
Third, if we’re talking about USD being the dominant currency and bitcoin being used also, your waitress would be using a device where they input the amount in dollars and it would generate a QR code with the amount of dollars converted to bitcoin with the exchange price that the device is aware of. No math is required. Literally none.

I invest small amounts of my paycheck into BTC. Roughly 10% of spending cash. I’m using it purely as a store of value, a “digital gold” of sorts. I’ve doubled my first buys at $7,000 and have been buying ever since. If I had the funds, I would invest more. What’s it like having the ability to invest more than, say, $100/wk? I bet the profit margins are insane. 
@_date: 2019-07-31 10:10:51
Honestly, your best bet is to install a wallet software such as Electrum on your PC, disconnect the Computer from the internet and create a new wallet with electrum. Write down your generated SEED PHRASE (24 words), as well as the DERIVATION PATH (looks like m/49’/0’/0’ , the derivation path that Electrum uses), as well as the (optional) passphrase. Once you’ve done that, use the Electrum software to get a Receiving address and send bitcoin to that address. After you have a receiving address (or multiple: check out the “Addresses” tab and just write down multiple addresses for later use), you can literally delete the wallet file and uninstall Electrum.
As long as you have the Seed phrase, derivation Path, and the optional Password, you will be able to recover the private keys to your bitcoin on virtually any Wallet Software.
Edit: ONLY DOWNLOAD ELECTRUM FROM THE OFFICIAL ELECTRUM WEBSITE  
If you are concerned about the legitimacy of the download, you can either check the PGP Signature for the installer or build from source via the GitHub page since Electrum is open source.
A detailed guide for setting up an offline wallet using Electrum can be found by going to

No it’s not too late to go further in. The choice is yours whether you want to buy more while the price is going insanely high.

So far, they’ve been wonderful to me. They increased my buy limit for some unknown reason to me today, which I found kind of odd since I have very little BTC Invested. But at least they’ve been keeping me up to date about SegWit2X and service outages which I appreciate.
There’s lots of inconsistencies across their services. The bank payment option on GDAX says that a deposit clears within 2-4 business days. The email you receive when you deposit from your bank says 2-4 business days at the bottom. But the confirmation message and the actual date of arrival are 6-8 days. It’s minor things like this that make me have a tinge of skepticism toward them.
Oh, and not to mention the horrible customer support line.

@_date: 2017-12-07 02:40:01
Keep some fiat on GDAX for emergency buys when the price dips so you can buy quickly and not wait 6-8 days, plus I’m pretty sure the limit is higher on GDAX.  Much much lower fees too. .25% for market orders and 0 for limits and stops.

Ledgers don’t ask you by default to use a Passphrase as far as I’m aware. But you Can in fact use an “extra word” in your seed phrase when generating private keys. Wallets like Wasabi do this, and Electrum allows you to do this.

No. Edge Wallet uses `m/44’/0’/0’` derivation for legacy addresses and `m/49’/0’/0’` derivation for Segwit addresses. BRD uses `m/0’` derivation. You’ll have to sweep the funds into a new BRD wallet with new seed.
BRD also only allows 12 word seed phrases, not 24 word seed phrases which Edge uses.

Anything on [this list]( is fair game. UTF-8 is a standard for how characters get converted to bytes (aka an “encoding scheme”).
Edit: keep in mind that creators of wallet software are not **required** to implement BIPs in their entirety, and some even get implementations wrong. For example, wallet A may only encode passphrases UTF-8 without normalizing (NKFD), but wallet B may encode to UTF-8 NKFD. Usually developers test edge cases like this beforehand with random, nonsensical characters, but again it’s not a requirement to have properly tested code.

As a last resort, if recovering from seed phrase into Electrum doesn’t work and recovering the wallet in MultiBit doesn’t work, you should try exporting the private keys by following this guide: 
Do NOT password protect the file, as you want to be able to see the keys in the file.
Create a new wallet in Electrum, then sweep the private keys into the newly created Electrum wallet. Guide is here:

No. New blocks only care about the hash of the block before them. But in a way, it’s verifying the entire history since that previous block’s header includes the hash of its previous block, and the hash of the previous block’s previous block’s header contains the previous block’s header, etc.
Edit: this is why it’s called a chain. They are intrinsically linked. If you change the hash of an earlier block, the hash of the block after it changes, which means the hash of the block after that one changes, etc...
Edit again: you should check out this video on hash functions.

Edit: if you’re trying to send the bitcoin to a gambling website, they may be flagging your transaction and preventing you from sending to known gambling site addresses. Try sending to an address you own first, but keep in mind many exchanges use blockchain analysis and can track where your bitcoin goes even after its left the exchange.

[Bitcoin Core 0.18.0 RPC Reference](
Probably what you’re looking for is “getblocktemplate” since it will return the difficulty expected for the “next” block
@_date: 2019-11-01 03:03:21
**The data being hashed is the block itself.**
More specifically, a [Block Header]( A block header consists of the following data:
- Version (changes whenever you upgrade/update software and it specifies a new version)
- Previous Block Header's Hash (changes whenever a new block is added to the blockchain)
- Merkle Root Hash (changes whenever a new transaction is added into the block)
- Timestamp (changes every few seconds)
- Target Hash Value (changes whenever Bitcoin's difficulty is adjusted, every 2016 blocks)
- Nonce (changes after a hash is tried by incrementing by 1)
A [**Merkle Root**]( is just a tree-like structure that contains the hashes of all transactions in the block, represented in a single hash, so the "Merkle Root Hash" in the block header is a compact way of representing all transactions in the block, since Hash functions generate unique outputs for the input given (input being all the transactions in this case).
The **Target Hash Value**, referred to as **Difficulty**, is the value that the hash of the block header must be below in order to be considered valid and to satisfy Proof-Of-Work. This target adjusts every 2016 blocks to ensure that the average time to find a valid block header's hash is approximately 10 minutes given the combined hashing power of all Miners.
Finally, the Nonce is just a number that gets incremented in order to change the hash value until we find a valid block. This is what Miners change when they are "solving the math problem".
Let us take an example, with hashes shortened to just the first 8 characters:
I have the following "Block" I want to validate (THIS IS JUST A SIMPLIFIED EXAMPLE). This block consists of 2 transactions:
Transaction 1: Spends 10 BTC to Alice : Creates 5 BTC to Bob, 5 BTC to Alice
Transaction 2: Spends 2 BTC to Charlie : Creates 1 BTC to Steve, 1 BTC to Charlie
The hash of Transaction 1 is: `10c66212`
The hash of Transaction 2 is: `22e41d0b`
The Merkle Root Hash is: HASH OF(`10c66212` + `22e41d0b`) = `e992b559`
Let's assume the hash of the previous block is `c3aa8624`
The Target Hash Value is: `0aaaaaaa`
Our timestamp we're going to keep constant for simplicity: `100883`
Assume version = `1`
Now that we have all the data for our block's header, we start hashing it, changing the Nonce each time until we find a hash value that is below the Target Hash Value.
With Nonce = `1`, we get: HASH OF(`1` + `c3aa8624` + `e992b559` + `100883` + `0aaaaaaa` + `1`) = `3598e199` , Too High
With Nonce = `2`, we get: HASH OF(`1` + `c3aa8624` + `e992b559` + `100883` + `0aaaaaaa` + `2`) = `3eb9f77a` , Too High
With Nonce = `3`, we get: HASH OF(`1` + `c3aa8624` + `e992b559` + `100883` + `0aaaaaaa` + `3`) = `01ae86d3` , Wallah! We found a valid block.
`01ae86d3` as an Integer is 28,214,995 which is lower than `0aaaaaaa` (178,956,970) and therefore our block's hash is valid. We solved the "puzzle" for this block and can broadcast it to the network's nodes, whom will then verify that the block header hashes below the target themselves.

You’re doing OK. Having the backup Ledger Nano S is unusual, but there’s nothing wrong with doing it that way. Just make sure you keep both in a safe location, and have a strong PIN on both. There’s really no need to have the seed phrase recovered on the Nano S, nor is there a need for the Nano S at all if you have your seed phrase because you can recover any wallet with just a seed phrase. **Your Seed Phrase IS Your Wallet. Not The Hardware Device.**
Your hardware device is only for generating that initial seed phrase, and signing transactions — aka spending your bitcoin. However as soon as you enter that seed phrase into something else, your wallet is only as safe as the device you recovered the seed phrase on.
@_date: 2019-11-01 01:28:57
part 2:
1. There are no accounts in Bitcoin. The best analogy (and what it's actually called) is a **Wallet**. A wallet knows how to build and sign transactions, can display the total balance of all your coins, and contains a collection of private/public key pairs. The public keys are converted to Bitcoin Addresses which you can share with others to receive Bitcoin (aka they send bitcoin to your address). Note that this is a gross oversimplification and only what an average user needs to know.
So Bob opens his Bitcoin Wallet and opens a "Create Transaction" menu. Bob enters Steve's address as the recipient, and 1 Bitcoin as the amount to send. Bob presses "Send", and the wallet builds an unsigned transaction by combining unspent coins Bob owns as Input(s), Steve's address + 1 Bitcoin as a new unspent Output, and (if Bob's spent coins is more than 1 BTC) a "change" output back to one of Bob's addresses as a new unspent Output. Note that when you spend a UTXO, you spend it fully. This is why we have to have a "change" output back to Bob if the UTXOs he's spending does not exactly equal 1 BTC. Bob presses "Send".
2. Bob is prompted to verify the transaction for any inconsistencies before Signing and Broadcasting. Bob accepts, presses "Sign &amp; Broadcast", and the wallet finds the private keys associated with the public keys of the addresses he is spending coins from. The transaction is signed by these private keys, and the signatures attached to the inputs as proof that Bob owns the coins he is spending.
3. The signed transaction (transaction with signatures on the inputs) is then broadcast to Nodes on the Bitcoin Network. Bob either runs his own Node that is connected to his Wallet, or his Wallet is connected to a random Node. The wallet must be connected to a Node, as by itself a Wallet does not talk to the Bitcoin Network. It only builds and signs transactions.
4. The Nodes that hear of the transaction first verify it by doing the checks I described in an earlier comment, and add the transaction to their own Mempool. The Node then forwards the transaction to all other Nodes it is connected to. If the Node in question is being used by a Miner, then the Miner will add the transaction to his/her block (if it is not already full).
5. Eventually, a block will be mined that includes Bob's transaction. Until that time though, the transaction is considered "unconfirmed" (not included in a block), but it is still a valid transaction if in the mempool of nodes. If the transaction sits in Mempool too long, it is removed from the Mempool and forgotten about essentially meaning the transaction never took place since it was never recorded in a Block (by default this is 14 days).

Welcome to the rabbit hole ;)
@_date: 2019-11-13 00:13:41
It depends on the wallet you’re using. Some wallets include the fee as extra on top of what you type into the amount field. Some wallets include the fee as part of what you type into the amount field. 
Ledger Live includes the fee as extra on top of what you type into the amount field. This seems to be the most common way of handling fees, so you can know *exactly* how much you send to the other person.
@_date: 2019-11-24 13:19:26
I really love Segwit, as we could theoretically use it to artificially increase the block size to any amount. Since fees are paid based on vBytes and block sizes are also based on vBytes, all it would take is for a soft fork which decreases the weight of Segwit portions in transactions. Currently it’s 3:1 for regular transaction data to witness data. This could be increased to 10:1 for example, and witness data would count only as 1/10th the weight of regular transaction data.
@_date: 2019-11-05 02:23:35
It would be up to node operators to manually adjust the `minRelayFee`. Ever since Bitcoin Core v0.12.0, a node will ignore transactions with fees below 1 sat/byte. Not impossible, just highly improbable.
@_date: 2019-11-14 20:51:25
For more reading check the [Bitcoin Wiki]( on Address Reuse.
Reusing addresses is bad practice for multiple reasons:
* Spending bitcoin from an address reveals to the recipient how much bitcoin you have in the address, which may make you a target for both hackers and robbers/thieves if all or a majority of your funds are on that one address. Splitting your funds up into multiple, smaller Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) in multiple addresses obfuscates your total amount of bitcoin and will only allow an observer to see how much was in that one UTXO.
* Spending bitcoin from an address reveals the associated Public Key, which may be a problem if your wallet software has poor Random Number Generation when creating Signatures as an attacker could easily find the Private Key and steal all the remaining bitcoin in the address. This is also an issue for when quantum computing becomes more advanced and encryption methods are broken, specifically ECDSA, where an attacker could calculate a Private Key from a given Public Key
* The amount of UTXOs does not change if you send bitcoin to a singular address. Each time you withdraw from your exchange, a new UTXO is created. For example, if you've withdrawn 100 times from an exchange, it doesn't matter if you sent it to the same address every time or not as you'll still have 100 UTXOs. This means the fees for creating a transaction remain the same whether the bitcoin is split between multiple addresses or a singular address, and therefore there is no benefit of reusing an address.


If you want to separate your 1,000 bitcoin in a singular address to 1 bitcoin in 1,000 addresses, you can create a transaction with multiple outputs called a "Pay-to-many" transaction. Easiest way to do this is to use [Electrum]( with your Hardware Wallet. Note that the fees on this transaction would be pretty high. Each UTXO is 31 bytes assuming Segwit addresses (beginning with "3") which means 31,000 bytes for Outputs alone. Not to mention your inputs would probably be multiple UTXOs as well, as every time you withdraw from an exchange they send a single UTXO, and inputs are roughly 91 bytes (assuming Segwit addresses) and assuming you withdrew 100 times from the exchange that's 9,100 bytes for inputs. Combining this together, that's a total transaction size of about 40,110 bytes of data and at 1 sat/byte is 0.00040110 BTC .
Is this more secure? Sure, because of reasons above.
@_date: 2019-11-01 00:32:52
When I say "Bitcoin software" I'm referring to [Bitcoin Core]( which operates as both a **Wallet** (collection of private keys, capable of creating transactions, etc), and as a **Node** (maintains a copy of the Blockchain, verifies new transactions, verifies new blocks, etc).
When I say "Miner" I'm referring to a computer or [ASIC]( that is running any [Mining Software]( that is designed to hash bitcoin blocks. Usually, bitcoin mining software pulls transactional and block data from Bitcoin software through [RPC Commands]( The mining software's primary goal is to interface with the computer or ASIC to hash the data very quickly.


The Bitcoin software has a function that returns a template for a new block. The mining software itself issues this command to retrieve a new empty block template, then immediately starts hashing to find a valid block (it is OK for a block to be empty, but you will not get any transaction fees). The mining software will occasionally gather some transactions from the Node's mempool and place them into the block.


No. When you spend a coin in a transaction, you are consuming it and creating new ones totaling an equal or lesser value than what was spent. These newly created coins are unspent, and can be spent/consumed in a new transaction.
Like states, you do not need to define Block/Bitcoin Block and Blockchain/Bitcoin Blockchain separately. The block limit is technically 1MB but ever since Segwit was activated, there is additional "Witness data" that is included in blocks and the "virtual size" of the block is capped at 1MB. In reality, blocks can be 1.3MB of raw data. But that's not important for what we're discussing here.
Yes, the **Blockchain** is a collection of ALL transactions that have ever occurred.


If you want to use the bank analogy, sure, this works. However unlike banks, bitcoin Nodes do not implicitly trust eachother, and verify everything for themselves.
Your definition of Bitcoin Mining Software is incorrect (see above). You are describing a Bitcoin Node.


Spot-on! When a group of miners get together, this is called a **Mining Pool**. A group of miners all set their hardware to work on a specific block (like a decentralized super-miner) and divy out rewards once a block is mined based on the amount of work each miner put in.


I think the most important thing to know about hashes is that they are a 1-way function. You put any arbitrary data in and get a fixed-length output. Hash values must be deterministic -- meaning that for a given input value it must always generate the same hash value. Hash values must also be collision-resistant -- meaning that no 2 inputs should produce the same output. Hash values must also be pre-image resistant -- meaning difficult to go from hash to input, but easy to go from input to hash.
I'll write a separate reply for your scenario.

Looks like your node does not know the Genesis block. I would try stopping Bitcoin Core, deleting the `blocks` and `chainstate` directories, and restarting with default startup options.
Edit: I believe it’s not an issue with your blocks or chainstate file. More than likely you aren’t finding any peers to download blocks from, as I see no “new connection” messages. Verify that the computer you’re running bitcoin core on has internet connectivity and doesn’t have a firewall blocking traffic on port 8333

You should not use an exchange to receive funds unless it’s you sending funds to it. This is because exchanges typically only accept funds as yours if sent to **the address that shows when you click deposit** and this address changes periodically (it might even be after every time you click Deposit). If this was a wallet you owned, this wouldn’t be an issue as your wallet knows every address it ever has and ever will create. 
Do NOT use exchanges as a wallet.

Running a node doesn’t net you any profit at all.

What programming language are you using?
If your programming language doesn't support bits as an object type, you can use a boolean array to represent the 0's and 1's (false and true). Start off with your random entropy of 128 bits (16 bytes) and hash these bytes with SHA-256. Take the first 4 BITS (not bytes) of this SHA-256 hashed value, and append it to the end of your original random entropy bits. Then for each 11 bits in this Entropy+Checksum combination, convert the 11 bits to an integer and use as index for which word to use from the [BIP39 Word List](

If you want to be extra secure, you could sign with an address you’ve never sent/received at before.
However this is somewhat unnecessary, as signing a message is exactly the same procedure as when you sign a transaction to spend your coins. So in effect, when you sign a message, your public key gets revealed for that address. Same thing when you spend from an address, the public key is revealed. This isn’t dangerous at all **right now** since ECDSA is a secure signing algorithm (if implemented properly). It’s about as dangerous as reusing an address, minus the privacy implications.

Every 2016 blocks, nodes take the time at which the 2016th block was mined, subtract the time at which the 0th block was mined, and divide by 2016. This is the average block time. The nodes then calculate what they expect the next difficulty target to be, and if the next block does not include that target in its header, it is rejected. There is a formula for calculating how much to adjust difficulty by, and all nodes use this same formula and thus can anticipate what the difficulty should be in the 2017th block.
Edit: in the scenario where you’re a miner, you also typically run a bitcoin node and thus YOU know what difficulty it should be as well.

Electrum doesn’t force native segwit addresses on its users, I don’t know where you’re getting that idea from. Electrum is most definitely the most customizable and advanced wallet there is. In fact, I recommend using Electrum to recreate this transaction (since you can Import transactions from raw hex into Electrum) and rebroadcast it with higher fee. The problem though is you said you don’t have the private key anymore, meaning you can’t modify the transaction. How do you not have the private key anymore if you sent coins from it?
Otherwise your only option is to let this be a lesson to not use random websites to create your raw transactions. Since you don’t know the private key of what you spent from, even if the transaction never reaches the network/is removed from all node mempools, you won’t be able to spend those coins in any other transaction .

Your addresses are safe to share. An address starts with `1`, `3`, or `bc1`.
Private keys however are not. A private key starts with `L`, `K`, or `5`.

If a miner publishes a block it’s discovered and there is extra reward, your node (if not manually configured from the default Bitcoin Core settings to accept the invalid block) will simply ignore the miner’s node’s blockchain and not broadcast it. If less than 51% of the nodes that the miner broadcasts his new block to ignore the invalid block, then it will die off and be pruned as if it never happened. 
This is actually how changes are implemented, whether it be soft or hard forks.

There’s no release for 0.19.0 on the Bitcoin Core GitHub page. There’s no release notes nor a release posted on bitcoincore.org . v0.19.0 is not released yet, it’s still in development.

That means your transaction is 131,484 bytes...
Which means your transaction has ~900 inputs if you’re sending to a singular address...

The appeal to me is that I know, 100% with certainty, that the money is mine.
Once the Bitcoin is sent to an address I own, **I have full control of that money** and no one else can tell me what I can or can't do with it, or confiscate it in any way. I have the full confidence of Bitcoin's **Network** backing those coins.

[Bisq]( is a decentralized P2P exchange client application that uses the Bisq Network, similar to how Bitcoin Core is a client that uses the Bitcoin Network. You indicate what payment method you use for Fiat (most commonly Zelle, ACH bank transfers, money orders, and Face2Face in-person exchange), and can accept offers from people selling crypto for a specified Fiat payment method, or place an offer to buy crypto using a specified Fiat payment method.
When you accept a trade, you send a security deposit (usually 10% of the amount you’re buying) into a 2-of-2 multisig address, then once confirmed on the blockchain both party’s fiat payment methods are disclosed to each other so exchange of funds can be initiated in fiat. The seller then acknowledges receipt of payment and broadcasts a transaction sending funds to your address. 
If the trade goes wrong in any way, there’s a 4-day period in which either party can open a dispute and involve a mediator, whom decides upon a divvying of funds/solution. If the mediator cannot come to an agreement between both parties, an arbitrator steps in an decides on a final say.

He was asking whether the cost of the transaction fee depended on the price of bitcoin. Which, yes, it does. The transaction fee is denominated in sat/byte so if the price of a sat goes up, you’re (technically) paying more fiat/byte as well.

Perhaps a usage of P2SH multisig with timelocks in effect, where the “owner” of the coins can be changed based on the block height. For ex:
Transaction created in block 699,980: Prior to block 700,000 the Output of this transaction could be spent with a 2-of-2 multisig (both sender and recipient). But after block 700,000 the script evaluates to only check the recipient’s key. Of course, both parties would need to provide a public key to check against this 2-of-2 multisig.
However, there is no “input must be sent to X address” restrictions possible. So this would be kind of pointless, the more I think about it.

The address doesn’t matter for chaining unconfirmed transactions, it’s the unspent transaction outputs. So it’s okay to reuse your address but you need to distinguish between which UTXOs you’re sending from. What are you programming?

I’m talking about trading on Bisq. You have to send money to people somehow in exchange for bitcoin they sell. Of course you could give me an address but once you have those bitcoin you wouldn’t be able to buy more through the method suggested if you don’t have a way to actually **buy** more bitcoin.
Edit: the reason I’m offering is because you need at least 0.001076 BTC (roughly) to start trading on Bisq, since it operates solely on Bitcoin and requires a security deposit of Bitcoin Incase you do not hold through on your end of a trade.

It is common practice to only use an Address once. The address you’re getting from your ledger is an address that has never been seen before, because it will not show you an address you’ve already sent bitcoin to because of the first sentence of this post.
Ledger Live or any other app you use with your ledger (Electrum for example) will show you your **Transactions**, which you can then use to find your Address(es) that hold bitcoin. Ledger Live does not show you your individual addresses for whatever reason. So if you want to find out what all your addresses are — and what every address you’ll ever have — you should import the **extended public key (XPUB)** into a wallet software that Does allow viewing addresses, such as Electrum.
Again, not necessary to do so since Ledger Live shows you the transactions which you can use to determine what the addresses are.
@_date: 2019-11-02 05:16:00
The reason you should use a bitcoin address once, and only once, is for both privacy reasons and to prevent losing funds incase Elliptic Curve Cryptography is broken by quantum computing.
Pro tip: you can RECEIVE bitcoin to the same bitcoin address more than once, but SPENDING bitcoin from an address should **only occur once**. The reason is when you spend bitcoin, you have to present the **public key** associated with your bitcoin address in order to verify a Digital Signature proving you own the funds. If Quantum Computing is achieved to a degree that modern encryption methods are broken, you do **Not** want your public key to be known. This is because a future quantum computer would be able to derive your private key for the address from the public key alone.

If it’s a long term HODL, right now is a steal in my opinion. You should buy from a reputable exchange such as Coinbase for a large purchase. You could buy from a decentralized P2P exchange like Bisq, but a large Transaction may trigger flags to your bank and you’d have to explain it to them, aka you might go past the 4 days dispute period for a trade and risk losing a security deposit. However you could let your bank know beforehand about the purchase.
If you want my best advice though, I recommend **not** buying all at once and spreading out a large buy over multiple days or even weeks by Dollar Cost Averaging.

He didn’t copy an address that was already modified. He copied the **correct** address from the intended recipient. OP had a clipboard swap malware on his computer, meaning when he pasted the address in Electrum or whatever other wallet he was using, it would then show a **different** address from the one that was just copied. This means that OP saw the correct address when he copied it, but failed to verify what the address he pasted was correct. In any case, a hardware wallet would have only prolonged the inevitable since it seems like OP made no effort at all to double check the recipient address.

Contract law would have assisted. It’s not like they were being impersonated from the very first time they spoke with you. Unfortunately hindsight is 20/20, so you’ll know for next time to verify the authenticity of the person you’re dealing with next time. Honestly this isn’t bitcoin’s fault. Sounds like adding this type of “refund” mechanic would be bloatware for bitcoin. Rather than pinning the responsibility of this mechanic on the payment method itself (Bitcoin), why don’t we establish a way to verify identities in a decentralized manner? We already have ECDSA signatures that can be used to verify messages associated with a given address/public key.

Coinbase is good for buying bitcoin, because they allow you to both deposit and withdraw bitcoin. But you should never leave your money on an exchange, whether it’s in the form of dollars or bitcoin.
But yes, Coinbase is good for buying bitcoin with dollars. However you should use their Pro version because it has a lot less fees:    It uses the same login credentials as your Coinbase account.
As for storing your bitcoin, I recommend a non-custodial wallet (aka one that gives you a 12 or 24 word phrase that acts as a backup for the wallet) such as Bread (BRD) wallet on iOS or Trust wallet. As for Android apps, I’m sure others in this subreddit have good recommendations.
Edit: Cash App is also good for buying bitcoin and is very intuitive/easy. They also allow you to withdraw and deposit bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-20 04:50:18
You can purchase bitcoin through Cash App, and after additional KYC (Know Your Customer) information such as a picture of your drivers license, they will verify who you are and allow you to withdraw, deposit, buy, and sell bitcoin.
One thing to keep in mind: the Cash App bitcoin wallet and almost all other exchanges have what are known as “custodial wallets”. This means that they own the private keys that own your bitcoin, and they reserve the right to at any time prevent you from accessing your private keys (similar to a bank/company/government holding your dollars from you). This actively goes against what bitcoin is all about: ownership of your money.
If you want to get more into bitcoin or want to just have some in the event there is more real world use (like you describe), or if you just want to say you own some, I recommend moving your bitcoin to a wallet such as Bread (iOS), Mycelium (Android), Electrum (Desktop), or a Ledger (physical device that stores your private keys completely offline). All of these wallets will give you a 24 word phrase that will act as a backup for deriving any and all private keys and the associated bitcoin addresses. *YOU SHOULD NEVER SHARE THESE 24 WORDS WITH ANYONE.*

So you're close, but not quite. Wallet software does this for you, by connecting to a random (or if you want, your own) Bitcoin node to retrieve the actual blockchain data to search and index transactions you care about. It's **100% not necessary** to know this information to use bitcoin.


Private keys don't need to be backed up, memorized or written down anymore. That ended back in 2012-2013 with the introduction of **Seed Phrases.** Seed phrases are 12 or 24 words that are used to generate ANY AND ALL private keys you will ever need. Only these words need to be backed up! And the best part is that your Wallet software will generate new keys for you automatically, and even manage Change addresses.

Because it’s true. You’re not actually buying bitcoin. Like I said, you can’t withdraw the bitcoin or deposit it, so how do you even know that they actually bought that bitcoin or have that bitcoin?

If you want to use a desktop wallet still, try Electrum. It’s open source. **ONLY** install Electrum from  **OR** by building from source code on the Electrum github at  . Likewise, if *at any time* Electrum warns you that there’s a new version available or an update, **go to the Electrum website**.
Edit: You May also want to learn how to check GPG signatures on files. You will need [GnuPG](  (the “simple installer” works) to verify GPG signatures for downloads. This requires that you trust [ThomasV]( the creator of Electrum. 
The good news is that Electrum can even work with your hardware wallet (for ex: [Trezor]( and [Ledger]( which are physical devices that securely store your private keys *offline and airgapped*. When you need to Sign a Transaction, you must first accept the recipient address that shows up on the device. The physical devices are safe to be run even on a device infected with malware, as they never transmit sensitive information across the connection (USB or Bluetooth).

I mean that your backup is a different set of keys. This is the only explanation (excluding malware) for why you are not able to find the change address after a rescan of the blockchain.
If the image you posted regarding the transaction was AFTER the rescan, and your bitcoin core software detected that transaction as being from Keys You Own, then you were 100% hit by malware. The malware changed the receiving address for the change in your transaction prior to signing.
Edit: actually, even if you took that image BEFORE the rescan, it still shows the change address’ output as being a SEND. Therefore it was malware.

Well considering that robinhood has a good reputation within the finance sector, I’d say you’re fine using it for small profits if you only plan on holding onto the bitcoin for small periods of time (think weeks).

Is the email used in conjunction with a defined password or salt to derive the seed phrase?
Otherwise, how could you recover a wallet with just an email address if it’s a non-custodial service?
@_date: 2019-08-04 04:29:08
Yes. Converting to fiat is a taxable event, as well as exchanging bitcoin for another cryptocurrency (for example trading bitcoin for ethereum, or ethereum for litecoin, etc). Buying things with bitcoin is also a taxable event (for example buying a Ledger with bitcoin). However, bitcoin transactions where you are using the bitcoin to transfer from wallet to wallet or from address to address and are not receiving any goods in return, that is not taxable as there is no conversion of bitcoin to fiat or a different cryptocurrency and there is no gain of a different type of property.

The “Block Header” is hashed. A block header consists of the following:
- Version (4 bytes)
Updated whenever you update software.
- Previous Block Hash (32 bytes)
Updated whenever there is a new block.
- Merkle Root Hash (32 bytes) 
Updated whenever a new Transaction is accepted or Coinbase Transaction is modified
- Timestamp (4 bytes)
Updated every few seconds
- Bits/Difficulty Target (4 bytes)
Updated whenever the difficulty is adjusted
- Nonce (4 bytes)
Increments every time a hash is tried
If the hash of all this data (concatenated together) produces a hash that has a lower or equal amount of leading zeros when compared to the Bits/Difficulty, then it is considered “mined” and you have discovered a valid Block. Since miners are so fast these days at trying hashes and therefore incrementing the nonce, the nonce overflows quite frequently as it is only a 32 bit number whose max value is 4,294,967,295 (unsigned). When the nonce overflows, an “extranonce” is incremented which is a section in the Coinbase Transaction (the transaction that generates bitcoin to the miner) which in turn changes the Merkle Root Hash of the Block header, creating a new set of nonce range to increment through.
Edit: FYI, a hash function takes an arbitrary amount of data and produces a unique, set-length value that cannot be reversed. You can easily go from Data -&gt; Hash, but it is impossible to go from Hash -&gt; Data. The hash we use is so large of a value that there are essentially 0 chance that a combination of data will hash to the same value as a different combination of data (aka a Collision).

An address isn’t just a single hash: it’s the SHA-256 of your public key, which is then hashed again by RIPEMD-160. And in fact, quantum computing does not pose a threat for either of these, especially SHA-256. What quantum computing WOULD be able to do however, is break Elliptic Curve Cryptography. Meaning if your public key is known with quantum computing, your private key would also become known.

“Confirmations” is how far back in the blockchain your transaction got into a block. When you see “1 confirmation”, that means your transaction was successfully placed into a block and is now on the blockchain. Each confirmation you get decreases the likelihood that your transaction could theoretically be reversed or tampered with **exponentially**. Having 6 confirmations is the de-facto rule of thumb for “this transaction is completely immutable and is near impossible to tamper with”.

If a transaction has too low a fee and hasn’t been included in a block in a certain amount it will be removed from the mempool of nodes that know about it. As for how long this is, I don’t know. But you can always enable RBF (Replace By Fee) for the Transaction, which will allow you to essentially double spend the coin by invalidating the previous transaction.

The biggest issue with Refunds and Disputes is that it inherently has to involve a human component, generally in the form of a mediator that will provide some moral bias on who is in the right. Perhaps we will get to the point one day where AI is capable of making moral and rational decisions, but until that day we are only left with one option to resolve disputes: involve people and their laws. To a computer or to a software program, you sending funds to an impersonator looks the same as if you sent it to the real company. You would have needed to have the company register their address or a smart contract beforehand (aka the contract solution via ECDSA Signatures that was mentioned previously in the comments). Otherwise there is no way to fix this issue.
Perhaps a Layer 3 escrow feature would be nice, that solely implements the establishment and maintenance of such smart contracts and their respective Mediators.

There is no such thing as a Legacy Private Key. A private key is just a very large number.

When you click Receive in Bitcoin Wallet, It only shows a QR Code instead of an address. I like to know what my address is and like to copy/paste it because I don’t always have a QR Reader available (ex sending from your exchange to wallet). It’s important to know whether your address is Legacy, Segwit or Bech32.
EDIT: Looks like you can be on the main Balance screen and click the QR code to the right and it'll show your address. Whoopsies. 
It doesn’t use BIP39 (mnemonic seeds, aka the 12-24 words that allow a full recovery of your wallet) and instead stores an encrypted backup file on your device. I like to know what my seed phrase so I can feel comfortable with recovering my funds in case I lose the device or have to factory reset.
Also: Bitcoin Wallet uses Bech32 addresses by default which are not used everywhere, however there’s still an option to use a Legacy payment address (it’s pretty hidden though). Whereas with something like Mycelium, you can switch between the address types at will.

Well if that is the case, you should be able to:
- derive more address using the other suggestion in this comment thread to expand the keypool size of your wallet. Eventually you’ll reach the change address you sent to. This is assuming you have used 500+ change addresses prior.
- Do the command in a different comment thread where you check if “ismine” is true.
- Do a walletdump and import the Private keys into Electrum to see if the coins are present and spendable.

There are 2 scenarios that could cause bitcoin to go to ~$0 :


This would cause a LOT of issues, for more than just bitcoin. The entire premise of privacy in the digital age would be shattered and we would need to come up with quantum-resistant or quantum-proof encryption and hashing algorithms.


If ECDSA is reversed, all Unspent Transactions on the blockchain become vulnerable and bitcoin developers would need to fork the code ASAP to support a new signature algorithm and keys. The users of bitcoin core would also need to update their software immediately and transfer their funds to new keys/addresses.
More than likely, the bitcoin community would vote to fork bitcoin to before these events occurred just like with the case of Ethereum splitting into ethereum and ethereum Classic. Depending on how quickly this was detected, and how many people actually update their bitcoin software, this would save the price of bitcoin (at least one of the forks).
@_date: 2019-08-19 00:00:30
I don’t understand the question, could you try rephrasing it?
Currently that information (like the amount of Fees paid) IS visible and incorporated in a bitcoin transaction and is why block explorers show you the fee paid. Nodes also are aware of the time at which a transaction is heard about and added to their mempool, thus block explorers can also determine when a transaction was broadcast.
Edit: oh, I think I see what you mean now. You’re saying a transaction that would allow a 1btc output to be spent but only up to 500 sats every 5 hours that has passed since creation. The answer is no: once you spend a bitcoin Output, that output is consumed. So if you wanted to spend the bitcoin after 50 hours, you COULD spend 2500 sats. But the rest of the bitcoin would be burned/gone forever since trying to spend any of that output again would result in a double spend attack.
What you’re looking for is the lightning network, which does allow for payments over time with 1 initial funding payment.

Funds can be “deleted” by rendering them unspendable, either by sending to an address that no one has or knows the private key to, or by setting the output script for the funds as a Burn script (essentially just returning 0 on the script stack). However in order to Burn coins, it’s usually to show support for something or to prove a point, etc, and requires creating a raw (manually created) transaction as this kind of thing is not supported by Wallet creators.

Well if that’s the case, assume you have the worst malware possible. In reality, you should just wipe the computer and start fresh. But in this hypothetical, assuming you weren’t aware of the malware, your software wallet would be completely fucked. If your wallet file wasn’t encrypted with a password and wasn’t a watch-only wallet, ALL your funds are gone. But if it was a watch-only wallet (aka only an extended public key that requires a Hardware wallet device to sign transactions) then you’re fine. The most common attack is a clipboard hijack, where they will change the address you copied to a different address. This would be immediately noticeable by you when pasting the address into the software wallet itself. There is a more nasty form of malware usually presenting itself as a legitimate version of your own wallet software that will change the address after you press “Send”, never alerting you to the change until you look at the transaction that it broadcast. However, if this was a watch-only wallet and you were using a hardware device with it, the software would ask your device to sign the transaction, and your hardware device would display the hacker’s address and not the one you’re expecting (just like how the clipboard hijack got defeated).
The reason for this not failing is that your hardware wallet is the only thing that can sign the transaction. If the transaction it is signing has the hacker’s address as a recipient and not your intended one, then you would immediately catch this. If it however tried to wait for the signed transaction then modify it afterward, your transaction would never make it into the blockchain because the signature would not verify.

As a blockchain developer, learn Go, C++, C, Python, PHP, CSS, and HTML. In no particular order.
You can take the Java or JavaScript route as well, as there are implementations of core cryptographic principles. But if you want to build a scalable application, it’s best to rely on C++, Python, and/or Go in some shape or form.
You can also join developers like [me]( and [Bob Holden]( in creating Bitcoin applications to gather experience and rewards for contributing.

I believe that the time you pay the bill is the time you convert Bitcoin to Fiat. If you proposed to buy something a week ago worth $5 but you wanted to buy it in bitcoin, then a week passes by and you need to pay the bill, it's still going to be $5 no matter what happened to the price of Bitcoin. If you were buying something for an exact Bitcoin amount instead, then you should respect the Bitcoin amount and ignore Fiat value since it was proposed to be sold IN BITCOIN. Make sense?

It will increase for sure, but there’s no benefit to having more total hashing power for miners. The only benefit is added security in the blockchain; the same amount if coins (which are decreasing every 4 years) will be divided into smaller subdivisions as pools become larger with more hashing power. There is no incentive by large government entities to increase the hash power unless they believe the security of the chain needs to be increased.

If you’re paranoid, restore the wallet from seed phrase with something like Electrum (you can boot Electrum in an airgapped, offline environment like TAILS OS if you are *really* paranoid), then generate a brand new Seed on TREZOR, generate a receive address, and send all of the coins (sweep) with Electrum (broadcast it if not airgapped, export the transaction then broadcast if airgapped) to your new generated address under the new seed which hasn’t been seen or exposed.

I really do hope that the value of bitcoin continues to increase, but at the same time this means that the cost to transact keeps getting higher and higher. Even if we ignore USD valuations, each sat will be worth more over time and that means a simple 1 sat/byte fee today could be a Huge Hit to your wealth in the future. To be fair, this is necessary as the miners need to get paid somehow with the eventual 0 block subsidy, but I don’t see how this will be sustainable as a means of exchange. Lightning aside.

BCH, like many other altcoins, have to adjust their difficulty more quickly or else they might get stuck with hour, day, or even month-long block times. Imagine this scenario:
- 95% of hash power is toward BTC
- 5% is toward BCH
BCH price suddenly spikes, hash power diverts from BTC to BCH. This means the block time will drop drastically until the next difficulty change. The difficulty will adjust to match the hash rate in a quicker-than-expected amount of time. Cool and all, but let’s consider the opposite.
BCH price suddenly drops, hash power diverts from BCH to BTC. This means the block time will in increase drastically until the next difficulty change. But that means the time to adjust difficulty also increases. Now let’s say so much hash power was diverted that BCH blocks start taking weeks to mine. This is very bad and would cause BCH to become severely unprofitable for miners and eventually die. The time to adjust the difficulty back to what it should be is now increased dramatically to years and years.
Edit: replace BCH with Any altcoin and you can see why this applies for all of them. Altcoins do not have majority hashing power and must compensate for that with quicker, more dynamic difficulty adjustments.

**Bro**, I don’t mean to sound rude here, but I know a lot about this subject, and I’m literally only trying to help. Please just listen.
I will explain it in-depth:
- the transaction window in your Bitcoin Core “Transactions” tab indicates that you have consumed a transaction input you own private keys to, and created 2 transaction outputs to addresses you do Not own.
There is no debating this. That is a fact. Right there in your bitcoin core client. It’s telling you that you sent bitcoin to 2 addresses that you don’t own.
If the address that was used for change was an address you owned, you would only see 1 entry for “SENT TO”. But instead, we see 2. **Something is clearly not right.**
- so we test the backup wallet.dat, by placing it into the bitcoin core data directory and doing a rescan of the blockchain. But the transaction details still remain the same, and the transaction did not disappear either...
This means one of 2 things:
- you in fact owned the transaction output that served as the input for the transaction, but you own **neither** of the addresses the funds were sent to. **Therefore you were a victim of a malware attack.**
- or, the backup file you are using hasn’t generated enough keys to find the change address (highly unlikely as you’d have had to burn through 499+ change keys already).

There are very few ways someone might be able to gain access to your wallet and/or private keys:
- Bad Random Number Generation in wallet software can lead to [leaking of private keys]( when signing transactions
- The wallet software that created the seed is malicious/malware and [gives a fake seed]( or they also know your seed
- Brute forcing through 2^253 combinations if your seed is 24 words, and 2^128 if your seed is 12 words. These numbers are so large that all computers in the world working at the same time **just to find your seed** could not do so without the universe dying in a heat-death)
- ([this is a rare one]( Exposing the Private Key of an address *and* its parent extended public key will allow access of every private key of an account in the seed phrase’s derivation path, but **does not** expose the seed phrase itself

If you made the wallet in Coinomi, try recovering from seed phrase using Electrum. Try making a new wallet, one for each address type (legacy, Segwit, native segwit) until you see your balance. Since coinomi gives you the option to select which *type* of address to receive at, it’s a possibility that some of your funds are legacy, some are Segwit, some are native segwit, etc.
Edit: if you know your addresses started with “1”, recover as Legacy. If your addresses started with “3”, recover as Segwit. If your addresses started with “bc1”, recover as native segwit.

The most amount of “company” interaction you have is with the app developers. There are trusted and open source (aka the code is open to public scrutiny) wallets on both Android and iOS phones, and desktop wallets as well for Windows and Linux. The bitcoin network itself, however, is not a company. It’s a protocol — a set of rules — that can connect its users through code.

Tl;dr: the Ledger Nano X is worth the extra money.
You cannot use the Nano S with your phone, only computers. In my opinion, the Nano X is **by far** better than the Nano S in almost every way. 
Using it is very easy, since I can just use my phone with the Ledger Live app and Ledger to send and receive, without having to be around a computer. With the Nano S, Ledger Live app is strictly a watch-only wallet and you can only transact by using the desktop version (or Electrum). This makes it very convenient so I don’t have to carry around a USB connector with me if I want to transact. Also, the Nano X has a much wider display making it easier to verify addresses and values.

A hardware wallet would have prevented this, as a malware could theoretically change the address you send to AFTER pressing “Sign”. However, with a hardware wallet in conjunction with a desktop wallet, this would not matter as your hardware wallet will display the FINAL transaction recipient that only the hardware wallet knows how to sign. The issue is that your private keys get exposed on desktop wallets when you are signing transactions, thus it would be possible for an attacker (if they had some pretty malicious malware on your computer and impeccable timing) to change the signatures and output address AFTER they were exposed so as to never alert the user of something gone awry (until they start to look at the unconfirmed transaction’s output address). The hardware wallet doesn’t have this issue as the private keys never leave the device.

Hashing algorithms used in bitcoin are not threatened by Quantum computing, however **ECDSA and EC keypairs Is threatened by quantum computing.** Bitcoin uses ECDSA for proof-of-ownership for spending funds, and EC keypairs for destination addresses and verifying ECDSA signatures.
The way to combat this in the current version of Bitcoin is to simply never re-use addresses. This way, your public key is behind a double-hash (not broken by quantum computing), and only when you spend funds from an address is the public key exposed (able to be reversed with quantum computing to find the corresponding private key).
I have high hopes that when (not if) Elliptic Curve cryptography is broken, Bitcoin developers will have already started working on -- if not completed -- a hard fork that is quantum resistant. However at that point, I'd be worried about more than just Bitcoin being broken...

The reason we’re iffy about that transaction is because your wallet software is clearly not recognizing your supposed change address as your own address, since there’s a “SENT TO” and negative balance in red next to the change in your Bitcoin Core tab (the image you showed us). As for why hackers do it this way? This is how nearly ALL Wallet malware works: change the address at the very last second to make it seem like it was user error.

Bitcoin = A decentralized **network** of computers all running software that complies with the rules of what we -- the users and developers -- have decided should be valid. The most common Bitcoin software is the original client called Bitcoin Core, but any software that complies with the guidelines set in place may operate with the Bitcoin network.
Another useful term will be "UTXO" or "Coin", which simply means an **Unspent Transaction Output**. A UTXO consists of a recipient (usually the hash of a public key, or the hash of a *script*), an amount (of Bitcoin), and a script that must be satisfied to unlock/spend the UTXO. This is the "ledger entry". Transactions involve "spending" these UTXOs by providing the correct **signature**, and creating new UTXOs with their own unlocking scripts.
1. Bob broadcasts a Transaction to the network. This transaction contains a few pieces of information:
	- A reference to existing UTXOs that Bob wants to *spend* (INPUTS)
	- Signatures for spending those UTXOs, proving Bob owns the Bitcoin he is spending
	- New UTXOs for where Bob wants the Bitcoin to go (OUTPUTS)
2. Other computers pick up this transaction and begin to verify it. To verify the transaction, they do the following:
	- Check that the UTXOs being spent actually exist and haven't been spent already
	- Check that the Signatures satisfy the UTXOs unlocking scripts
	- Check that the amount of all Outputs is less than or equal to the amount of all Inputs
	
3. When the Transaction is verified, the computer verifying adds it to a "mempool" -- collection of verified transactions that it is aware of, but aren't included in a Block yet. The computer then broadcasts the transaction to other computers until all (or most of) the computers have heard of the transaction. IF THE TRANSACTION DOES NOT VERIFY, the computer simply discards it and doesn't broadcast it any further.
4. Miners all the while are gathering information about transactions in the network via their own mempool, and are constantly adding transactions from their mempool to potential Blocks until they find a valid Block. Then the Miner's computer broadcasts this Block to every other computer.
5. Every other computer validates the Block, and rejects/ignores the block if it is not valid. If the Block is valid, the computer iterates through each transaction in the block and if it's present in their mempool, it is removed. And the cycle continues.

I agree to a degree, but we can still have methods of immutable transactions with the use of trusted parties. Casual users already do this in the form of SPV nodes/RPC/API and simply don’t care about the loss of privacy and verification. Not everyone needs to run a full node, or run a lightning node.
Hopefully one day with better UI/UX, we can update and leverage the Lightning Network to be scalable (without too much backend security loss) for everyday users.

Feels like you’re making an esoteric argument. Trust will always exist. Take science for example: we all agree (for the most part) about the scientific consensus of gravity and the shape of the earth, but we have to place trust in the scientists. Just like with bitcoin, it’s possible to verify these claims if you have the knowledge to do so. You can imagine the developers are simply scientists whom laymen can trust, and whom those capable can verify.

I’ve coded my own wallet. I don’t have to trust external wallet software. I’ve gone through the code of popular wallets like Electrum and I’ve verified they are sound.
But I didn’t write the programming language. Nor did I come up with the methodology for the hashing and signing algorithms used. Nor did I invent the computer I use my programs on.
At some point there has to be a baseline of trust. Sure you can make your own Bitcoin addresses and create your own transactions with pen and paper, but you’ll spend hundreds of hours doing the calculations. You could even make your own software like I did. It all depends on how much you care about trust and whether you believe the individuals that have already verified code for you.

You are not guaranteed to find a block in 10 minutes. The process is random. It’s a gambler’s fallacy to believe that the chances of finding a block increase with the amount of time spent finding a block. Just because the last block took 3 hours to find, doesn’t mean the next block will come extremely fast. The past does not influence the present when mining.
Edit: the difference between BCH and BTC difficulty adjustments is the timeframe used. In a way, BCH’s difficulty adjustment is more stable and can change to suit the network’s hash power more quickly. BCH adjusts difficulty every block based on the **median time passed** of the last 11 blocks, rather than BTC which adjusts difficulty every 2016 blocks based on the **average** block time of those 2016 blocks.
TL;DR: BCH adjusts difficulty after essentially every block. BTC adjusts difficulty every 2016 blocks.

Robinhood does not have to give you anything back for your bitcoin investment. Bitcoin is not a security.
Straight from the robinhood website FYI:
“Robinhood Crypto is not a member of FINRA or SIPC. Cryptocurrencies are not stocks and your cryptocurrency investments are not protected by either FDIC or SIPC insurance.”
Check it out here at  at the “Secure &amp; Trusted” section and hovering over “Insurance Disclosure”.
Edit: they can revoke your access to the bitcoin because you never had bitcoin... it’s not hard to understand. If you don’t know your private keys or your mnemonic phrase in order to derive your private keys, you do not own that bitcoin. It might as well be equivalent to giving someone your cash to have them hold on to a spreadsheet that says they owe you X amount.

This isn’t true. Even if quantum computing is achieved, hashes will not be broken. The wonderful thing about addresses is that they use A DOUBLE HASH of the public key. Only when the transaction output is spent, is the public key revealed. Therefore even if ECDSA is broken by Quantum computing, funds in addresses that have never been spent from are safe.

When you broadcast a transaction in bitcoin, this transaction gets added to node’s “mempools”, AKA the current transactions that have not been recorded into the blockchain, but transactions they are aware of and that are valid.
The question becomes, what incentive do Miners have to add your transaction into a block? The answer is Transaction fees. Say you have 10 BTC and want to send 2 BTC to someone (let’s say his name is Bob). You would create a transaction with inputs totaling up to 10 BTC, and two outputs: 2 BTC to Bob, and 7.9 BTC back to yourself. But wait, where did the 0.1 BTC go? In transactions, the inputs are allowed to be greater than the outputs. Any remaining BTC that was not in an output is given to the miner as an incentive (Transaction Fee).
The amount of this transaction fee is not set in stone, and varies depending on how active trading is, how much in a rush people want their transaction confirmed, etc. a good place to check the current fee rate is [Here]( however modern wallet software calculates this fee for you and usually offer an Economic option (lower fee) and a High Priority option (higher fee). Note: the fees are represented as sat/byte, with sat being 1/100,000,000 of a BTC. To get the total fee value, you multiply the sat/byte ratio by the size of your transaction in bytes. Again, this information is not needed for an everyday person as the wallet software will do these calculations for you.
A “confirmation” means that a miner has created a block that has included your transaction. Any additional blocks that are created AFTER the block your transaction is in is considered another confirmation. 1 confirmation is considered pretty likely that your transaction will stay written in the blockchain for good, but most sites and folks will recommend 6 or more to be Completely Sure that your transaction has gone through. This is because there is always, although very very small chance, that the block containing your transaction becomes orphaned or a re-organization of blocks occurs. The more buried into the blockchain your transaction is, it becomes exponentially less likely to be undone.
Some places accept “0 confirmation” transactions, given that the fee is sufficient to be confirmed/included in a block within a reasonable amount of time.


Your wallet software should handle all of this for you. If you play around a bit and start receiving some bitcoins, you will notice that your “Receiving address” changes after it has received bitcoin before. This increases your privacy on this Public blockchain, and also your security. If the private key of that specific address somehow gets stolen (highly unlikely), then you will not have compromised the other addresses where you have received funds, nor will the attacker be able to find out which addresses are related to the one they stole from.

Decentralized - no central authority, each participant validates for themselves with no need for trust. Messages from peers are shared to other peers, but only if the message follows a majority consensus protocol. Misbehaving members are in the minority, and the ability of an individual to have authority over consensus means you must control more than 51% of the network’s decision-making power.
Permissionless - anyone can join the network at any time, and validate information they are missing to build their own copy of the ledger. They do not need permission from any node to join the network, as all nodes are treated equally until given a reason to not trust or connect.

This implies that they use a **CUSTODIAL WALLET** service, and have to abide by the United State’s KYC/AML laws (Know Your Customer &amp; Anti Money Laundering), just like every other exchange that perates in the United States. This is nothing new. Most exchanges however don’t make you verify your Bitcoin address before sending to it to make sure it’s you, but instead verify your identity through your Social Security Number or other Government issued ID. What other exchanges don’t tell you upfront is that they do the EXACT SAME THING as far as tracking your bitcoin once they’re off the exchange, because they do Blockchain Analysis.
Bitcoin is not anonymous. Blockchain analysis is real and somewhat easy for big companies to use. If you want privacy after sending off an exchange, use a Coin Mixing/CoinJoin service.

Most exchanges require KYC (Know Your Customer) to comply with local government laws. This information typically includes getting information from your bank about you, a government ID like social security card or drivers license, and a general Check to make sure you aren’t doing illegal things.
These exchanges (ex: Coinbase, Cash App, Gemini, etc) are also **centralized** meaning all trades happen through them. If they don’t approve of a trade, or suspect foul play, they can terminate your account at any time. All of your money is routed through them as well.
A **P2P Decentralized** exchange (P2P means Peer to Peer) is an exchange where funds are transferred from person-to-person, without a central authority. For example with Bisq, every person trading is running the open source trading software called Bisq and they can post buy/sell orders for other people also running Bisq to accept. Trades are completed with no need for a central party, meaning if you buy bitcoins you’ll be receiving bitcoins directly from Bob, and sending fiat directly to Bob, usually through some form of mobile app that allows money transfers like Zelle. 
How is this regulated though? How are you protected from people that want to cheat you out of your money? Both buyer and seller have to lock up some bitcoin as a security deposit for the trade. If the trade doesn’t happen in a set amount of days (4 days) then either person can open a dispute. This is where a Mediator (outside 3rd party, also a user of the Bisq software) decides who is in the right and who is in the wrong, awarding the locked up security deposits to the person being cheated.
This means you need some initial bitcoin for the security deposit in order to trade on Bisq, but you can circumvent all need for a centralized Exchange and can better protect your privacy if you don’t like the government knowing what you buy or want to avoid KYC.

It’s fine to use a standard HDD, an SSD would work just as well but is overkill. I use a 1TB Seagate external hard drive that works just fine. You have to be concerned with Power though, because using a 1.5A power supply won’t keep the pi and the HDD running. You’ll need a better power supply (I have no problems with my 3A 5V power supply which powers my pi case’s fan, the HDD, and the pi itself 24:7)
As for how long the download and verification of the blockchain will take, it depends on how high-end your computer is that you’re using to download the blockchain from. For me, my computer is a piece of shit laptop that’s at least 5-6 years old and it took me 2 weeks to download the entire blockchain onto its internal storage. From the internal storage, I used FileZilla (or any other file transfer you wanna use such as WinSCP or what the guide uses) to transfer that blockchain data onto the FORMATTED (ext4 format) HDD which took roughly 10-12 hours. The rate of transfer was about 900KB/s - 2MB/s at any given time.

XPub to YPub/ZPub is a simple change in the version bytes. The decoded XPub from Base58 to bytes contains 4 bytes at the beginning known as Version bytes (for XPub the version bytes are 0x0488b21e).

I first heard of bitcoin in 2015 when it was at ~$500. I bought $5 worth (all I had at the time basically) and left it in for all of 2 days. I tried a few faucets, too, but these proved difficult and didn’t feel worth it on my shitty phone. I bought some cigarettes with the $4 something I had left because of Coinbase fees.
Fast forward to late 2016, I hear about it again through reddit. I signed onto my Coinbase account and saw my first transactions, and had regret. Nonetheless, I wanted to figure out Why this bitcoin thing was gaining so much traction.
So I finally get KYC’ed, and I start buying bitcoin every paycheck. $5-$10 every 2 weeks. I didn’t have much, so I was expecting negligible gains. But I felt like I was participating in something new and revolutionary.
2017 hits, and I start learning more about the technology itself and it’s fundamentals, and get absolutely hooked. Not only was the price going up, but so was my confidence in its principles. I started asking friends and coworkers if they’ve ever heard of bitcoin or cryptocurrencies/blockchain, and would try my best to educate and encourage them to learn more about this amazing piece of software.
Coming up to now, I’m building a decentralized blockchain client in Java as my first major application. I’ve learned my lesson regarding the price. The thing is: HODL. There is no reason not to. If you look at the tech, you’ve got no reason to not  own at least some of this stuff.

Bitcoin cash itself is an actual cryptocurrency that is traded on some major exchanges (Coinbase for example). Download and install the BRD (bread) wallet and click on “receive” in Bitcoin Cash. Give the other person your “address” which is the long string of characters when you click Receive. That’s how they can send you BCH. If they ask for an email address or the 12-24 word phrase, or ANY OTHER INFOMATION than the Bitcoin Cash ADDRESS, they are attempting to scam you.
However, the cryptocurrency itself is real and is used. (Albeit it is not popular and for good reason).

That’s for the Channels. I believe he’s asking about Wallets that are compatible with funding LN Channels. To answer OP: I believe what you want is a P2SH-P2WKH address [Further Reading](  which is a SegWit address compatible with legacy addresses (ex. An address starting with 3). If you are running LND, you can create a new address in your LND wallet by using the command `lncli newaddress np2kwh`
You need a Segwit-compatible address to fund a LN Channel (an address starting with 3 which can receive and send to Legacy addresses, or starting with “bc” which is a Segwit-only address)

The first time you scan through a block, you have verified its contents and doesn’t need to be scanned again. 
There is a data structure alongside the raw block data that just contains the Transaction Outputs that are not spent (UTXOs) in it called the `chainstate`
Then for each new block that is picked up by the node and is verified (checking whether the block can be hashed with the previous block’s hash and be under difficulty, input scripts unlock referenced outputs, etc.), each transaction’s inputs are removed from the chainstate and each new output in each transaction is added to the chainstate. The current block height of the chainstate is also saved, as well as a copy of what the chainstate was before the block was mined in case the block is orphaned for a new chain. 
So to recap with some pseudocode, validating a block:
validate block header hash
if false, reject block
for each transaction:
  for each input:
    UTXO = find referenced output from chainstate
    if UTXO doesn’t exist, reject block
    evaluateSig(input, UTXO)
    if false, reject block
accept block
And for updating chainstate:
backup chainstate
for each transaction:
  for each input:
    remove referenced output from chainstate
  for each output:
    add output to chainstate
update block height value in chainstate
Edit: formatting (on mobile).

Final thoughts: if you do decide to follow through with this, you’ll want to get a case for your pi. Get AT THE VERY MINIMUM some heatsinks for your pi. It Will get hot and this Will affect not only performance but the lifespan of your hardware. I also recommend turning off autopilot as it really hinders performance of the pi and takes up processing power since it constantly assesses the need for more channels.

As for losing power: your node will simply become inactive after a period of time if you go offline. If you reconnect to the internet again/turn the pi on again, your node will sync back up and will attempt to get the most uptodate status of your channels and position in the network. 
Corrupt Files/data in the event of a power outage is a concern. Since when a pi loses power from an outlet it immediately shuts off. That would be my biggest worry, since the lnd service and bitcoind service won’t be given proper time to safely stop before losing power. But again this is mainly a concern in the event of power outages. If you want to move your pi and disconnect it temporarily, you should always follow standard shutdown procedures anyway.

Good question .
It is in your best interest to move your cryptocurrency off of an exchange if you don’t plan on selling it fairly soon or trading. If you do not know the “seed phrase” of your wallet, then you do not own the coins. Exchanges are custodial wallets - they maintain a balance of how much they owe you. Only when you withdraw to your own wallet do you own the bitcoin. 
A non-custodial wallet is one where you know the 12 or 24 word seed phrase necessary to backup your wallet. You see, your bitcoin addresses are generated from your seed phrase. If you know it, you own the keys to unlock the bitcoin that comes with those addresses. 
I recommend Bread Wallet for iPhone because it is straight forward and has a nice UI. Mycelium for Android since its relatively user friendly and has wonderful manual fee adjustment.

Lol yeah, it’s an ECDSA-generated keypair that’s seeded with a SHA1PRNG random number. The public key is given an address which is generated by the bitcoin method of [pubkey hashing]( 
It gives me a public address  that I can then convert the private key into WIF (wallet import format, basically the same as the pubkey hashing method but with a different header attached to the first round of RipeMD160 hashing) and put it into a seedless electrum Wallet.

PS: if you have iOS and are using Mycelium, I recommend switching to a better wallet soon because it WILL crash on you. Specifically when you try to open the Transactions page. It’s been a known bug that bricks the Mycelium app (even if you uninstall and reinstall) that’s been going on for 2+ years. I really liked Mycelium at first and it was the first mobile wallet I used, but be ready to switch and write down your seed.

Everyone would be able to see that you spent the coins opening channels, because each channel Opening is a transaction on the bitcoin blockchain. They would also be able to see when you close the channel. Closing channels is also a transaction, and you’d be spending the UTXO of the Opening transaction.

Native segwit (bech32) has lowest fees to send from and receive to. Addresses start with “bc”. **Some** services support sending to bech32 addresses.
Legacy addresses have the highest fees to send from and receive to. Addresses start with “1”. **All** services support sending to legacy addresses.
Segwit addresses are a middle between the two. Addresses start with “3”. **Most** services support sending to Segwit addresses.
As long as the wallet software you use supports sending to any address type, you should use the cheapest one to store bitcoin in: **native segwit**. This is because wallets that offer native segwit addresses usually always have the option to generate a legacy address using the same master seed.
@_date: 2019-12-07 03:57:57
You’d need one of the following:
- the 12-24 word seed phrase to recover the wallet
- the private key to the address being either a 32 byte hex-encoded number, or a Base58 encoded string starting with `L`, `K`, or `5`
- the wallet file you used to create the wallet

From what I gather, you have a seed phrase (12 or 24 words) and you want the private key for an address (ETH address). I recommend using [Ian Coleman’s BIP39 Tool]( I also recommend saving this website to your computer and using it offline for safety. Set the “Coin” to “ETH - Ethereum” and look for your address in the section titled “Derived Addresses” below. There will be a private key listed next to it, and that’s what you import. You may need to change the “Derivation Path” tab to BIP44 or BIP32.
@_date: 2019-12-12 02:44:34

Your options are limited on iOS as far as good, customizable, open source wallets are concerned. My personal recommendation would be HODL Wallet.
* Pros
   * Open Source fork of BRD Wallet with altcoins removed.
   * Allows for custom fee selection instead of relying on Fee Estimation algorithms that tend to overpay.
   * Lets you connect to your own Bitcoin Node if you have one.
   * Easy and intuitive UI
* Cons
   * Not BIP44 compliant (uses m/0' as derivation path), meaning recovering your wallet from seed phrase will not work in most other wallets. You will be required to restore within HODL wallet, use a desktop wallet that supports custom derivation paths such as [Electrum]( or restore in another wallet that uses the same derivation path (ex: BRD Wallet). More information [here](
   * This shouldn't matter to a normal user, but it is a pain in the ass to start a new wallet if you've lost the current wallet's Seed Phrase or the PIN to open the wallet. Uninstalling the app does not remove the wallet data from your associated device. I have not discovered a way to forcefully remove and start a new wallet with the app.

How? Is he running a mining pool that accepts 0 fee transactions made on the exchange?

They used to not have any fees up until a couple months ago, and it was just a markup on the price using a spread to account for volatility. 
But now they charge a fee in addition to a markup. However it's still IMO one of the easiest, quickest, and most convenient way to get Bitcoin into your own address if you live in the US.

Solid math, although the numbers are slightly smaller than that. It’s better to think of it in terms of the entropy bits that the seed phrase encodes. For 12 word seed phrases, there’s 128 bits of entropy and 4 bits of checksum for error detection. So that means there’s 2^128 different possible **valid** 12 word seed combinations, or 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 a significantly smaller number but still extremely large nonetheless.

I’m not sure if you run a full node, but an 8x size increase in the block size would be detrimental. I currently use a 1 TB hard drive, and if the block size increased 8x in size it would be filling up 8x as fast. Not to mention 8x the bandwidth. Sure, storage is cheap and I have an unlimited data plan. Another 1 TB hard drive would cost me $80. But $80 to me is not the same as $80 for someone elsewhere, and they may be paying for limited data. When you increase the block size, no matter how artificially small it may seem to You, it impacts someone in a less sound financial situation elsewhere. After all, Bitcoin is for financial sovereignty and independence, which the lower class needs most.
For me personally, I wouldn’t mind the Segwit 2X proposal. Raise the base block size to 2MB (double), because that’s a gradual change and I can afford it, plus I don’t think it would have too large of an effect on the ecosystem.

???? A node isn’t about storing bitcoin it’s about verifying transactions and maintaining a copy of the bitcoin blockchain. A ledger is a hardware wallet that only stores private keys.


You have a decentralized alternative and it’s called bitcoin. Decentralized means there is no inherent trust on a third party, which means Reputation is NOT taken into consideration. What you want is a centralized payment processor that uses the bitcoin decentralized network for you.

I think you’re neglecting the hardware aspect of these devices. They are built in such a way that “stealing” keys from the devices is impossible unless you have physical access to the device. There are no WiFi adapters in the devices, and nothing is able to leave the device unless you physically press a switch that connects specific wires on the chip. If you wanted to, you could build your own hardware and use the Trezor firmware. Or even the ledger firmware. All the parts used to build the devices are available for consumers.
In addition, you do not have to use the device’s built-in mnemonic generator and can use your own BIP39 seed phrase.

The keys never leave the device. You can use them in conjunction with an airgapped computer if you’re worried about malware being transmitted across USB, although I can assure you will never happen because the devices are very limited in terms of what they can transmit. You are incorrect in saying they “connect to the internet” in order to do those operations. They only need to be sent data. If you want a true offline solution, get a pen and paper and start doing ECDSA yourself to sign your own transactions. HMAC-SHA512 and the multiple SHA-256 hashes will take you a really long time, though. If only there was some tool, or firmware, that did this for you, in a secure, offline manner?

Exactly, and it couldn’t be done any other way as transactions with less than 1 sat/byte are rejected by default. Coinbase would have to cooperate directly with mining pools to coerce them into including transactions with 0 fees, which does not benefit the miners in any way.
Alternatively what this could mean is that Coinbase will cover the transaction fees for you, but they *already do that*. So I must be missing something, or they aren’t actually creating bitcoin transactions and are just modifying internal database values of who has “bitcoin” on their platform.

@_date: 2019-12-04 03:39:20
Yes, I do understand that. That’s the whole reason I encrypt the xprv even in memory to make the attack window as small as possible (the few milliseconds the key is decrypted &amp; used to sign). This is the same thing that Electrum does, but probably on a key-by-key basis where they are derived beforehand and not with the entire xprv.
To me, I find this sufficient. Is it the best? No. But I take comfort in knowing that I didn’t have to rely on code written by anyone else when it comes to the Bitcoin operations.

Cash app is not a wallet, it’s a custodial exchange service that lets you keep bitcoin on it. You should move your funds to a non-custodial wallet, AKA one where you control the private keys with a 12 or 24 word backup phrase.
As far as addresses go, that’s what you send to in bitcoin. There are no “contacts” because addresses **Are** the contacts. And the addresses (should) only be used once and a new one created for each transaction. If you want some sort of “contacts” thing where you enter the person’s email address, you could make a script/program yourself that checks an email address and fills in a known address for that person, or you could use a custodial service (NOT RECOMMENDED) like Coinbase that lets you send to other Coinbase users by their email address.

Typically yes, especially as you state it was a Ledger device. If you used the Ledger Live or Electrum (basically any wallet that isn’t Wasabi) software to generate a receive address, then deriving the first address would be fine. I would recommend deriving both the first external address as well as the first internal address. You could even query an API like blockchain.com or Blockstream.info. If you do the latter (meaning you DON’T know an address you’ve sent to), query for “firstseen” rather than balance since there is a possibility you’ve done more than one transaction and the address doesn’t have any balance anymore.
@_date: 2019-12-07 05:06:32
I personally use and recommend Native Segwit but it’s up to you. It depends on if the exchange you use (to buy bitcoin) supports sending to Native Segwit addresses. However since you’re newer to bitcoin I think you should keep the addresses and wallet you currently have.
I also highly recommend you try to recover your wallet as a test to prove to yourself it really works. You don’t need to delete your current wallet file to do this. Simply create a new wallet with Electrum and use your seed phrase. Since you have Segwit addresses, you want to have the derivation path set to  `m/49'/0’/0’` . After you recover the wallet and see it has your balance, you can delete the newly created wallet.

No they don’t. That’s why I made my own wallet software. Generated the seed offline so I know the Entropy source is sound, imported into my software, and I know that it stores my information securely. The xprv is encrypted via AES in memory while the program is open, and on-disk the entire file is encrypted via ECIES. Keys are only exposed in memory of the program during a signing operation. It would be great to learn a better language for memory management like C or C++ for this, but for now Java will do until I learn how to do what I did in the better languages.
Edit: obviously the OS and the password I use are the weakest links here. But like I said, if I could build my own OS I would. For now the best verified options will have to do, AKA Linux/Windows.

It doesn’t work like that. First off, miners **build** blocks, they don’t get them from anywhere. An analogy: They simply bundle a bunch of transactions together and put a pretty wrapper around it and call it a block. They then try to put a bow on the top in order to make it valid, but they can’t seem to find the right bow. After a couple 100,000,000,000 different bows, he finally finds the right bow and the network will accept the block. Now he could have also found the “right” bow in 5 tries, 100 tries, or even 999,999,999,999,999,999,999 tries. There is no way to predict what bow will work best except to try it. This is “mining”.
Each block created is unique, and if anything is changed in the block (anything) then the entire “ID” of the block will change. This makes the block invalid, because if the block’s “ID” was valid before the change, it definitely won’t be valid after a single change in the miner reward value (otherwise miners could find blocks really fast). Other miners would continue trying to find their own block since it wouldn’t matter/would be a waste of a few precious seconds if they tried working on the rejected block.
Also, the reward is cut in half every 2016 blocks found. The block reward will drop from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC in about a year from now. Once the block reward is 0 BTC, blocks will still continue to be mined. But miners will only receive “compensation” for their efforts from transaction fees instead.

[I wrote this]( awhile back about deriving addresses from extended public keys, and the section regarding addresses may be of interest to you. 
there are 3 main address types in use today:
- P2PKH (often called “Legacy”)
  - starts with `1`, highest fees to spend/send to
  - **all** services can send to these addresses
- P2SH-P2WPKH (often called “Segwit”)
  - starts with `3`, middle fees to spend/send to
  - **a majority** of services can send to these addresses
- P2WPKH (often called “Native Segwit” &amp; “Bech32”)
  - starts with `bc1`, lowest fees to spend/send to
  - **some** services can send to these addresses, and increases every day
Depending on the wallet software you are using, any address type can send to any other address type. You could have bech32 addresses, and send to legacy/Segwit/bech32 addresses. You could have legacy addresses, and send to legacy/Segwit/bech32 addresses, etc. There is no restriction on the Bitcoin protocol level that prevents you from doing this, only different wallet developers that place restrictions on their apps.
All are recovered from seed phrase the same way. All address types encode a **public key** in some way, but the derivation path may differ. For example, Legacy addresses are typically derived along `m/44’/0’/0’` (wallets following BIP44) or `m/0’` (ex: BRD Wallet) or `m/0’/0’` (ex: Bitcoin Core).
Segwit addresses are typically derived along `m/49’/0’/0’`, and bech32 addresses are typically derived along `m/84’/0’/0’`). **Note** that the public keys generated from your seed phrase **are different based on the derivation path taken**.
To fully recover a wallet, you need both the derivation path and the seed phrase. If you don’t know the derivation path, look up the wallet software’s documentation for recovery.
@_date: 2019-12-21 20:29:47
So the derivation path is independent of the type of address you make. The derivation path was defined in BIP32 and later expanded in BIP44 to have a set structure that can be reused: m/44’/0’/0’ , where m is the master seed, followed by 44’ being the “Purpose”, then 0’ being the “Coin”, and 0’ being the “Account”.
What this allows is a standardized way of deriving addresses for multiple cryptocurrencies. In Bitcoin. We’ve defined some BIPs to use the “Purpose” section to mean “Address Type”, such as BIP44 (legacy addresses), BIP49 (Segwit addresses), and BIP84 (native segwit addresses). The “Coin” section for Bitcoin is always 0’, but is different for other cryptocurrencies that want to use this scheme.
The only thing the derivation path does in reality is choose which Private/Public keys you end up with when creating addresses. However, any address type can be made from any public key. You could have a derivation of m/12857’/7462’/100’ and still be able to make a native segwit address. You would simply be using a non-BIP84 compliant derivation scheme, since you would need to know 3 pieces of information for recovery: The Derivation Path, Seed Phrase, and Address Type. However with these standards in place discussed above, you only need 2 pieces of information, since Address Type is implied by the Derivation Path.

There are thousands of individuals whom contribute to Bitcoin Core’s development, and Bitcoin Core is not the only implementation of the Bitcoin protocol. Take for example Bitcoin Knots, a fork from the original client dating back since 2011, with improvements and different ways of building messages for the Bitcoin protocol. Any developer can build their own Bitcoin client from scratch, or build off of the existing *reference implementation*. This is how Bitcoin Cash was formed, as well as Litecoin. They all satisfy particular niches of a decentralized P2P transactional protocol, and each have their drawbacks. Point being, if you get enough people to use and participate in a cryptocurrency, the stronger it will be security-wise.

I agree, wallet’s tend to overestimate fees a lot. That’s a fault of wallet developers, not of the bitcoin network. You are free to choose to use a wallet that allows custom fee setting, and I hope one day that major wallet providers like Ledger allow this on their software as well because it makes no sense not to.
Also, there are multiple sites available to check the fee estimation. Example is  and right now you’d need only 9 sat/vbyte to get confirmed in next block (roughly $0.28)

Nodes are the backbone of bitcoin. Without nodes you wouldn’t have what you know as bitcoin. There would be no blockchain, there would be no consensus, there wouldn’t be anything. It’s not just for computer nerds/hobbyists, it’s for people who want Bitcoin to exist.

You will need to use Coinomi on your phone, or [Electrum]( on your desktop (preferred way). The second site shows the Derivation Path of most wallets, and the wallet you're trying to recover with (BRD) uses a different derivation path than Blockchain.com wallet. Read the beginning section of [this post]( in order to learn how to recover your wallet in Coinomi, or [Follow This Guide (recommended)]( to use Electrum. Once you've recovered the wallet in Electrum, you can send your bitcoin to an address owned by a different wallet you made, for example in BRD.

Try using [Ian Coleman’s BIP39 Tool]( offline. Save the web page, then disconnect from the internet. Enter your seed phrase, scroll down to the section titled “Derivation Path”, select either BIP44 (address starts with 1), BIP49 (address starts with 3), or BIP84 (address starts with bc1) as the tab and iterate the Account number until you see one of the addresses that you’re trying to recover/find in the “Derived Addresses” section.
Take the “account extended private key” and import it into Blue Wallet for either Android or iOS. If you’re on the computer instead, you can skip using the BIP39 Tool above and just use Electrum. Try recovering with seed phrase but each time iterating the Account derivation path by 1 until you see a balance show up. Example: first try `m/44’/0’/0’`, then `m/44’/0’/1’`, then `m/44’/0’/2’`, etc. 
Change the `44` to match your address type, whether it’s legacy (starts with 1, use 44, called “p2pkh” in Electrum), segwit (starts with 3, use 49, called “p2wpkh-p2sh” in Electrum), or native segwit (starts with bc1, use 84, called “p2wpkh” in Electrum).

Now this is what worries me the most about bitcoin. I know that Satoshi envisioned and hoped that fees would compensate miners after the block reward ceased, but this effectively restricts bitcoin from ever being a “day-to-day” currency. The only users of Bitcoin will become those with a large enough amount of money to rationalize a $6 fee to transact, aka the amount of wealth being transferred is $200+ (3% of total amount seems acceptable to me). The sheer Security of the network could be rationale enough as well, but this only supports the idea of Bitcoin being a Store of Value where you don’t touch it because every time you do you lose an increasingly larger proportion of your funds.
I also don’t think hardcore proponents of layer 2 solutions such as the Lightning Network are thinking of the situation completely. Sure, Lightning works very well and will continue to improve. It may be used for day-to-day transactions. But it’s important to remember that Lightning **needs** to use Layer 1, **for every channel opened**, which means if fees are too high on the main chain this may be prohibitive of those with lower income. Let’s say I wanted to put bitcoin on my Lightning spending wallet, and my paycheck was 0.00273333 BTC ($400) bi-weekly. First, I would need to get some of this onto Lightning, so I can either open a new channel (boom, $6 gone) or use a service to fund an existing channel whom may charge a fee if they have to open a channel to you or because they don’t make enough in Lightning fees to support their operation. The second option increases the centralization of Lightning as the network becomes more and more reliant on large nodes run by companies whom maintain a large amount of open channels between nodes.
The prevalent use of Lightning would in turn cause the usage of the main chain to decrease, thus lowering the rewards miners receive, causing either an increase in fees or a decrease in overall security of the network as miners drop out (and this will continue in a positive feedback loop). This would continue for 2 weeks until the difficulty adjusts again, but would quickly happen again as miners greedily turn on more machines causing the reward for mining to decrease again. I feel this would cause the hash rate to become a consistent level, but I have doubts that this consistent level would be *secure enough*.

I already told you that if you imported the seed into Electrum then the “show seed” option will be greyed out. If you have the seed phrase already, then you don’t need to do anything.
If you want to test that your seed phrase is correct, use Electrum to make a New Wallet and select “I already have an existing seed”, make sure when you type the seed you go into “Options” and select BIP39 seed. When it asks for address type select p2wpkh-p2sh

Well for starters we’d probably clone the Bitcoin Core reference client into another repository where a different group of old and new developers would have commit privileges.
Then the community would flock toward whichever cloned repo they believe to be the most “official” based on consensus and merit of the developers with commit privileges.
Most cloned repos would die out and become unmaintained. But Bitcoin is large enough to where if development ceased by the few with power right now, the community would pick up where the work left off. After all, “Bitcoin Core” is just a reference implementation. Bitcoin Knots may take its place in such an event, and may even become the new reference client.
With open source, the community are the developers.

This wouldn’t require 2 transactions, simply make 1 and just use a separate output with the code value. I see how this could be useful but it’s still much better to have a null return output, for multiple reasons. 1, it’s cheaper. 2, it won’t clutter the chainstate with unnecessary outputs. 3, it is functionally equivalent to the codes, just as easy to check by blockchain analysis, and can encode an arbitrary amount of data without increasing cost to relay said message.
For example: a standard bech32 output is 31 vbytes. A standard null return output is 9+(arbitrary amount) vbytes. Let’s say the message you want to encode is “55882”which is small enough to represent in a varint as 3 bytes, totaling 12 vbytes. In fact, you could even record two messages in one output this way, as the value field could still be used (but you would effectively burn coins in the second message so it is suggested to be as small as possible, aka the dust limit of 0.00000546). By doing this, any message size less than 22 bytes would be cheaper than any form of standard output.
Keep in mind that bitcoin fees are based off of the size of a transaction, so it DOES cost more to send a transaction with multiple outputs and the cost is not negligible.

I’m saying the trust you put in Ledger as a company is not comparable to putting trust in the Bitcoin Core software. For starters:
- Ledger’s software is closed source and the Bitcoin Core software is not.
- You could have the Bitcoin network without Ledger, but you couldn’t have the Bitcoin network without Nodes.


No, because not everyone **needs** to run a node. But nodes **are** necessary for the network to function. Otherwise his ledger is just a really fancy paperweight.


Bitcoin doesn’t care either way. All that happened when he bought bitcoin was that someone somewhere made a transaction on the network that moved coins they owned into a new address owned by the guy buying them. To bitcoin’s eyes, it was just another transaction.
There is an important distinction to be made between wallet implementations and Bitcoin. You can use the network however you want, just depends on what wallet software you want to use. You could even make your own if you’re not satisfied with the way things are. Maybe others feel the same way you do, and are just waiting for someone to innovate. There are also ways to use reputable nodes in most wallet softwares, or better yet abstract that whole process &amp; connect to random nodes since the average end user doesn’t need to know. This already happens. But if you want something to change, it isn’t just going to happen automatically. Find a new wallet software like Electrum, or make your own. It’s that simple.

Your recovery phrase (12 or 24 words) **IS** your wallet backup. It is a standardized format introduced in BIP39, and is used by most wallets (such as Coinomi) in conjunction with BIP32, BIP44, BIP49, and BIP84. Your recovery phrase derives your private keys in a tree-like structure, following a **derivation path**. For example, Coinomi follows standard BIPs and legacy addresses derive along `m/44’/0’/0’`, segwit addresses derive along `m/49’/0’/0’`, and native segwit derive along `m/84’/0’/0’`. Due to this interchangeable format, you can recover your wallet with just the recovery phrase and derivation path. You could recover the wallet in Electrum, for example, and you’d have the same wallet in both Coinomi and Electrum with the same private keys.
If you want to sweep funds to a **new** wallet with a new recovery phrase and maybe a new derivation path, recover the wallet in Electrum then create a new wallet in Electrum (or whatever new wallet software you want to use) and send all the funds from the recovered wallet to an address owned by the new wallet.

The balance fluctuates because of the “commit fee” changing for the channels. The commit fee is the amount of sats required to forcefully close a channel if a node is not cooperating. The balance of your channel is taking this fee into account.

Exactly. It’s basically an initial stake into the cryptocurrency market as a whole, signaling your support for the system. If no one was buying or using bitcoin, retailers wouldn’t have a demand for adoption. Any amount of bitcoin or cryptocurrency you purchase is a benefit to the space as a whole toward a different future. It may go up in price, it may go down, but the endgoal is to not worry about the price at all and simply rely on the tech itself to have value.  This is, however, very far into the future. Day trading and futures/shorts is still very feasible because we’re still focused on the price pegged to a fiat amount. I have a feeling it will be this way for quite some time.

The best time to buy was yesterday. The second best time is now. I recommend setting up an account on Coinbase and using their [Coinbase Pro]( rather than the actual Coinbase site since there’s free withdrawals and small market buy fees (0 fees if you place a Maker order AKA specify the exact price you want to buy at). Electrum is a fantastic wallet as well if you want to transfer your coins to your own personal wallet.

If they don’t have any bitcoin nor any wallet? It would take 24+ hours as far as I’m aware, unless you have a bitcoin ATM nearby (or at your store if it’s a physical location). The reason being that even the simplest ways to purchase bitcoin with fiat (for ex: with the Cash app by Square) requires you to submit some form of identification and go through some sort of approval process. (If anyone can prove me wrong and link to an exchange that will take fiat for bitcoin without these requirements that would be immensely helpful for both OP and me).
If they already HAD bitcoin and a wallet, the process would take just a few minutes to transact or less if you would accept a 0 confirmation transaction with sufficient fees.

Yes unfortunately. If your IP changes then you won’t be broadcasting a public URI to the network. You’d have to manually change it in the conf file when your IP switches. If you want to get UPnP working, I recommend trying it out. But like I said, I’ve had loads of difficulty with it personally. If you do want to go the UPnP route, remove any port forwards you have to 9735. Then remove the `externalip` setting within your .conf file, and replace it with `nat=true` . You can’t have the port forward open when using UPnP as it automatically configures it for you.

There is definitely much that needs to be improved with Lightning first before it can be considered the true 2nd layer. The ability to refill a channel would be nice. The ability to use funds from other channels you have open to fulfill a pay request would be nice. Channel rebalancing built-in would be nice. More connectivity and better autopilot channel selection would be nice.
@_date: 2019-01-02 17:37:24
1. The command to connect to a node is
  “lncli --network=testnet connect &lt;URI&gt;”
Where the URI is the Public Key followed by @ followed by the IP followed by : followed by the port (9735) which is sometimes optional. This, for example, is the URI for testnet.yalls : 02a68237add204623021d09b0334c4992c132eb3c9dcfcb8f3cf8a57386775538e
There is typically always a “connect URI” available that nodes will tell you to use to connect with.
2. I do not know if that address is testnet.

I’ve decided that I’m going to start using bitcoin as a currency via Shift Card by Coinbase. Any reason in particular? Nah, I just wanna use it and buy more when I need to. Even though the shift card just converts the bitcoin to Fiat at the point of sale, it still “feels” like I’m able to use my bitcoin directly. Which means I’m going to be able to hold more of my money in bitcoin form rather than just using the fiat to buy bitcoin. Bitcoin will become my “main” currency with fiat as the secondary one. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 07:48:53
  If you have a Binance account to buy altcoins and you want to switch over to a singular wallet either on Coinbase or in your own wallet (preferably Electrum), you can minimize fees by using BCH.
  Switching between exchanges sucks, but for a majority of aIts the base pair will be with BTC. The minimum withdrawal pair fee for GDAX is with BCH at around ~$1.50, and Litecoin being a close contender at around ~$2.11 . Ethereum is too expensive, and BTC withdrawal fees are still 0.0005 (~$5.75).
Once transferred to GDAX, trade BCH/BTC and wallah! Minimal fees for cashing out of altcoins. I believe a wave is imminent, boys.

Sure, that’s a good strategy. I recommend choosing nodes from that site’s list at random though since you want to be helping smaller nodes connect with the larger network rather than just connecting with all the existing large hub nodes. I’m not 100% sure how autopilot works when you’ve got existing channels but I would assume it would allocate a percentage of your Current walletbalance after a restart of your lnd service.

Similar, 1 hop but 0 fees. I had opened a channel with OpenNode beforehand (took around 30 minutes). I’m starting to see a problem with lightning, that you have to open a channel with each person/company you want to buy from... which kinda defeats the purpose of it. Obviously this will be fixed as more nodes and channels are opened on the network, but right now it would have taken the same amount of time to just send bitcoin instead. I’m currently trying to buy a sticker from blockstream with one channel that has enough capacity/funds (the one I opened with OpenNode) but the payment keeps timing out.

You open port 8333 with your router settings... this cannot be done with a simple website online. Depending on your router, the IP will be different. To find this IP address, open a command prompt (assuming you’re on Windows) and type in `ipconfig` . Look for `Default Gateway` and type that IP address into your internet browser. It’s going to ask you for a username and password to change settings. If you’ve never set the password already, it’s most likely still set to its default. You can find the default password of your router by looking up “What is the default password for [NAME/BRAND OF ROUTER] router” . In most cases, the login is typically a username of `admin` and a password of `password` . Once you’ve logged in, you need to find where the Port Forwarding section is for your router (again, this varies from router to router). Then add your computer’s IP address and open a port forward for 8333.

Yes, it helps secure the network but does not bring any profits. Miners are the ones that create new blocks out of transactions sitting in mempool and are rewarded with the transaction fees and block creation reward. As for the Lightning Network portion, you Do gain some payments via fees for routing payments across your node but it is very small amounts (couple hundred millisats, or 1/100billionth of a bitcoin). So running a bitcoin node yields no profit, running a Lightning node yields minuscule profits.

I don’t like using UPnP as I can’t get it to work on my router. But what I did is edit my lnd.conf file to include `externalip=[Your External IP]` and set it as whatever your external IP address is. Alternatively if you have UPnP enabled, you should be able to just set `nat=true` in the lnd.conf and it will automatically broadcast your IP (but like I said, I’ve never been able to get this to work despite many troubleshooting efforts). You can find your external IP address [here]( (you want the IPv4 address)

1. Channels are Funded with an initial amount of bitcoin. Each channel has a local balance and a remote balance. The local balance is your amount, the remote is the other node’s amount. Funding/opening a channel uses an on-chain transaction which means it has fees for a normal bitcoin transaction. At any point once the channel is established (aka received 3 network confirmations), the channel can be closed by either party if they are both online. However, this would incur fees on the person closing the channel just like with opening a channel with an on-chain transaction. If, for example, the node you made a channel with is not cooperating (AKA they have went offline for an extended period of time) then you can Force a channel to close. In this instance, the one force closing the channel will pay not only an on-chain fee but what is also known as the “commitment fee”. This value changes over time (I’m fairly confident it’s a dynamic amount, not sure how it’s discovered) but it’s basically a reserved amount of sats in the channel that will go toward closing the channel.

@_date: 2019-01-17 08:13:10
A few points:
1) Coinbase used 6 sat/byte as the Fee. This was not a “next block guaranteed” fee amount.
2) Block mining speed can vary anywhere from 1 minute to upwards of an hour. However, this doesn’t really seem to apply here since looking at the previous blocks before the transaction was included in, the time between was relatively close to average (aka ~8 minutes)
3) This is IMMENSELY faster than a normal banking transaction. When you get a confirmation stating your payment has went through with normal fiat, you don’t actually have that money yet or sent that money yet. The payment processor is making an assumption that your funds won’t be bounced back. A normal transaction can take 2-3 days to be finalized. What you’re seeing on the blockchain, being included in a block and receiving a confirmation is the equivalent of those 2-3 days. You HAVE/SENT that money. It is available to you. No takesie-backsies, no bouncebacks. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 06:01:25

This is the part of the guide that may take a really long time if you’re just using autopilot without connecting to any initial nodes first. The way I got mine to finally start moving was to connect to yalls.org testnet node 02a68237add204623021d09b0334c4992c132eb3c9dcfcb8f3cf8a57386775538e which seriously kicked everything into gear. Also try connecting to various other nodes as well, htlc.me has a good node as well. 03c856d2dbec7454c48f311031f06bb99e3ca1ab15a9b9b35de14e139aa663b463
The good thing about yalls is that they also have an option to have them create an inbound channel to your node. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 01:44:14
If you configured Autopilot in your lnd.conf without setting a Max Channel funding amount, it will put as much as it possibly can into the first channel it finds (I accidentally did this with my own node, too. I just closed the channel and turned autopilot off) I recommend closing the channel unless you Want that channel open, and add some more configuration settings into lnd.conf by setting `autopilot.maxchansize=[some amount]` and optionally setting `autopilot.minchansize=[some amount]`

Nope. There are no alternatives. Your funds are essentially locked onto Coinbase for 19 days.

No withdraws at all. Not even to Coinbase Pro.

@_date: 2019-01-17 07:51:54
Transactions are put into blocks by miners and added to the blockchain, or a ledger/list of transactions. The longest blockchain is considered the correct blockchain. As for what electrum is asking you, it’s asking how quickly do you want your transaction to be included in a block. They are rough estimates based on the average fees of previous transactions that were included. For example, a transaction with a higher fee is more likely to be included in the next block created by miners, while a transaction with a lower fee will most likely sit in the mempool (AKA waiting for a miner to include it in a block) for a few blocks before being included.

They are buying the power to transact without a centralized system, or a government entity controlling their wealth. Bitcoin is meant to be a means of transacting freely across borders and without restriction. 
The only Value you’ll find in bitcoin is the technology itself: that’s it’s worth. I’m not sure what answer you were looking for, but the value is in the ability to be in control. No one can stop you from using bitcoin.

No, if you’re trying to view all your addresses you’re going to have to go through the transactions and find out which ones are your lnd wallet. It’s recommended to just create a new address for every transaction into the wallet.

If you want, you can send me your log files after a fresh restart. Copy the contents/transfer to your PC, this file: 
`$ nano /home/bitcoin/.lnd/logs/bitcoin/mainnet/lnd.log` 
And paste it onto pastebin or something so I can see exactly what is happening with UPnP enabled. Remember that when you switch to UPnP, you have to 
1) disable the Port Forward of 9735. 
2) remove the `externalip` setting in lnd.conf
3) add `nat=true` setting in lnd.conf
4) restart your pi, wait for bitcoind service to finish loading
5) unlock lnd wallet
6) wait about 5 minutes, then get the log info
PS: when restarting your pi, always restart safely. 
`$ sudo systemctl stop lnd.service`

Here is a guide on how to add common, frequently used commands to your RaspiBolt.
* Log in as admin
* Open the .bashrc file
`&gt; sudo nano /home/admin/.bashrc`
* Add the following aliases to the end of the .bashrc file
`alias lndstatus='sudo journalctl -f -u lnd'`
`alias bitcoindstatus='sudo tail -f /home/bitcoin/.bitcoin/testnet3/debug.log'`
`alias unlock='lncli --network=testnet unlock'`
`alias getinfo='lncli --network=testnet getinfo'`
`alias txns='lncli --network=testnet listchaintxns'`
`alias peers='lncli --network=testnet listpeers'`
`alias channels='lncli --network=testnet listchannels'` (Optional: See the reply for alternative)
`alias pendingchannels='lncli --network=testnet pendingchannels'`
`alias channelbalance='lncli --network=testnet channelbalance'` (Optional: See the reply for alternative)
`alias walletbalance='lncli --network=testnet walletbalance'`
`alias newaddress='lncli --network=testnet newaddress np2wkh'`
* Save and exit (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter)
* Update the .bashrc file
`&gt; source /home/admin/.bashrc`
* Next we will create some simple commands to add connections, open channels, and pay invoices.
`&gt; sudo nano /usr/local/bin/openchannel; sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/openchannel`
* Add the following text to the script
`lncli --network=testnet openchannel $1 $2`
* Save and exit (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter)
`&gt; sudo nano /usr/local/bin/connect; sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/connect`
* Add the following text to the script
`lncli --network=testnet connect $1`
* Save and exit (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter)
`&gt; sudo nano /usr/local/bin/payinvoice; sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/payinvoice`
* Add the following text to the script
`lncli --network=testnet payinvoice $1`
* Save and exit (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter)
* Test your new commands!
* **WARNING**: When you decide to switch over to mainnet, you will have to change all of these aliases and scripts and remove all instances of `--network=testnet`

How did you get your node to have an external IP? Mine isn’t broadcasting it to the network. I’m assuming you used `nat=true` in your lnd.conf, or do you have a static external IP? However when I attempt to do this I keep getting UPnP could not find devices error messages, despite my Gateway having UPnP enabled and no ports forwarding to 9735. I haven’t tried broadcasting my external IP with `lnd --externalip` but maybe I should. Did you encounter this issue at all?

The amount you Send is the amount of BTC that will be deducted from your Wallet’s balance. It Includes the fee. So if you want to send someone 0.05 BTC, and you want the fee to be a total of 0.00009 BTC, you should send 0.05009 BTC to cover the fees of the transaction so the recipient gets the full 0.05 BTC.

I feel there comes a point where initial transactions should be culled off (if this is possible). Perhaps once we reach 1TB, the chain should reduce in size by 1% or 100GB culling the first transactions off. And maybe repeat every time it gets to that point. I don’t think this is possible though.

I don’t use autopilot. It never worked properly for me, and would put all of my funds into a single channel when I had set for 5 max channels and 70% of funds. Instead I went to [1ML’s LN Explorer]( and created channels/connected to some of the most connected nodes and random redditors that have shared their URI’s. 
@_date: 2019-01-23 10:35:50
A few points:
* LN stands for Lightning Network. What I have set up is a Lightning Network Node. You can find information About my node [here]( 
* A node is a computer that is running the Bitcoin client software and relays transactions and blocks by verifying them with the information it has stored.
* A node contains the entire copy of the blockchain (all ~250gb of it) and communicates with other nodes letting them know what they have verified, what to verify, and receiving blocks to verify themselves.
* A full node relies on its own copy of the blockchain and simply broadcasts what it knows to the network as true, and taking any info it receives from other nodes as untrustworthy until it validates the transactions/blocks itself (This is where the phrase “Don’t trust, Verify” comes from)
* Lightning Network is software that you run on top of a Full bitcoin node that serves as a routing point in a decentralized graph of nodes. You open channels to other nodes, nodes open channels to you, and you can see a nice visualization of this [here]( and [here (takes a little longer to load)](
* Channels are funded with an amount of bitcoin to be opened with a transaction On the blockchain itself, but every transaction that takes place through the channels themselves are off-chain meaning they can be near-instantaneous and incur very low fees (millisatoshis or 1/100billionth of a bitcoin) and only when the two parties decide to take their funds out of the node to claim their balances do they close a channel and recover the funds with another on-chain transaction.
Hope this helps.

You want a balance of both decently funded channels and decent amount of channels. I’d say 10-15 channels is pretty good, and 1mil sat is plenty good. If I were you, I wouldn’t set your `autopilot.allocation=[amount]` to 1. Set it to 0.9 to account for channel-opening transaction fees. There’s currently a [bug]( when setting allocation to all of your wallet balance where it will create impossible channel openings due to not accounting for the transaction fee.

To buy BTC directly from Coinbase, there is a 1.49% fee assuming you use the USD Wallet or Bank Account.
To sell BTC directly to Coinbase, they take a 1.49% Fee assuming you use the USD Wallet again. (3.99% with PayPal).
All in all, you save 3.98% of your total purchase. The downside is that this is not always instant, as limit orders can take some time to fill.

@_date: 2017-10-19 23:40:17
I’m prepared to lose what I invest, although I’m being realistic and am calculating actively the amount I would lose if such a drop were to happen. I’m basing these predictions off past major drops in price, so I think it’s pretty safe to say that holding on to my coins for 2 weeks (and selling if it goes below my initial buy price) is PERFECTLY okay and very minimal risk.
I’m not trying to make huge bank. Realistically I’m expecting a profit of around $3 . But since I had the money to spare, I figured I would get my feet wet with a true bitcoin purchase and not just sit on the sidelines anymore. 
I believe myself to be fairly intelligent enough.

I’m not using Coinbase to withdraw the funds from the wallet. I’m simply using the Coinbase BTC Wallet since I find it to be more secure/easier to access than my GDAX account. The only time I have funds on GDAX is when I’m buying BTC or selling BTC back to USD. The only time I interface with Coinbase directly is to withdraw money from my USD wallet to my bank account, which as far as I know doesn’t incur a fee.

If your clients are willing to pay in Bitcoin, you can simply provide an Bitcoin Address and a specified amount denominated in bitcoin or fiat. If denominated in fiat, you can’t really be sure if they’re paying the right amount since exchange prices vary. If denominated in bitcoin, you can always be certain you’re getting the right amount but you could be underpricing/overpricing services depending on how the market changes from the time of invoice creation.

Thank you a ton. I looked up TREZOR and blockfolio. I feel like I might use Electrum on my Pi to handle my coins, as it’s the option I can go with at the moment without buying a hardware wallet. Blockfolio looks just like GDAX except it’s an app and no buying/selling, am I correct in saying that?
I’ll be honest, the only “investing” I’ve done is arbitrage on the Grand Exchange in runescape. I have a decent knowledge, and the capacity to learn, but online sources such as Wikipedia and google provide terms that I’m unfamiliar with and are sometimes worded very poorly. Getting advice from this subreddit has proven most beneficial so far, as it’s tangible advice that is in semi layman’s terms.

So basically, no one is bitching about what I’m doing, they’re just concerned about the source of the money being invested?
I understand that, but we all live different lives and are in unique scenarios. For me, at this current moment, I have two weeks left until rent is due, and I have extra cash also lying around in the case that this goes sour really quickly. This was a test buy to see what the process is, and for me at the moment losing half of $125 is not going to make me homeless.

@_date: 2017-10-20 00:59:30
GDAX is a site owned by Coinbase that allows you to trade bitcoin with others in a Maker-Taker Market model. [Link Here](  
Buying and selling at market value is a Market Order and is classified as a Taker, which takes liquidity out of the market. These orders are processed with a fee to support the market.
Buying and selling at a “limit” means that your order will sit in the market until the fiat amount you define is met. These orders are classified as Makers, which adds liquidity to the market. These orders do not have a fee.
Your Coinbase account is your GDAX account, and funds inside your Coinbase Wallets are immediately transferable to and from your GDAX account with no transaction fee. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 02:59:41

Yep! :)
HD Wallets can be derived from any derivation path, and some wallet software like BRD use m/0’/0’, bitcoin core uses m/0’.  However nothing stops you from writing your own software (or using Electrum) to import your own custom derivation path to create addresses of any kind, even custom non-standard ones and multisig P2SH. 
Thanks for pointing this out!

You don’t even have to try the last 2 words. You only have to try 2048 words because the last word is always a checksum.

The last word has 4 letters and ends in either “F” or “E”. There are 18 words that could be the 10th word (length of 5, also ends with “E” or “F”). I ran through the first set of 2048 words for the 12th word and got roughly 809 results. Assuming this is consistent for every 11th word (of which there are 2048 possible words), we get 18 * 2048 * 809 = 29,822,976
Edit: formatting, and I could be wrong with the 10th word. I assumed the 4th letter was an “L”, so it’s either “LE” or “LF”. I didn’t consider it could be an “I”.

Note, that there is an error in the P2WPKH address line, pointed out by The data that is bech32 encoded is 0x0014{PubKeyHash}, which is the exact same data as the P2SH-P2WPKH prior to the final HASH160. This is because the witness program is the same, except P2SH-P2WPKH wraps the witness program into a P2SH address which uses a hash160 of the scriptPubKey (the witness data in this case).

Since it’s history related, the history of mining would be a good topic. How we went from mining on CPU, to GPU, to ASICS (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits).
A potential topic could be the history of scaling and its many heated debates: 1MB vs 2MB Block size, transaction sizes and the implementation/benefits of Segwit, archival nodes vs pruned nodes and their benefit to the network as a whole, the ever-increasing chainstate size, potential future solutions such as block size increase and redistributing satoshi’s coins, etc.

Roll some dice. Example [here](
Edit: if you don’t want to use other people’s websites (even offline versions) because you don’t trust the implementation, you can either a) read the code yourself, since Ian Coleman’s BIP39 tool is open source, or b) derive the addresses yourself with a program you’ve written yourself. Attempting to do option b without a computer will prove to be very difficult and prone to errors.

Exactly what it says, it hasn’t loaded all the way. You can watch the logs in real time with this command, depending on where you saved the bitcoin files. For ex if your debug log is at `/home/bitcoin/.bitcoin/debug.log` , you would do:

I appreciate the time and effort you’ve spent making this. But going back to criticisms of One-Time Address: the generation of a new Address for every visit is extremely vulnerable to DDoS attacks. One could easily load the website more than 2,147,483,647 times with a botnet or just time and dedication, forcing the address derivation to crash. Not to mention you’d have to scan the blockchain using this new utility you’ve created to find out if any of those billion+ addresses have any UTXOs.
You could always create a new account level using BIP44 standards but this would require either a higher level extended pubKey or multiple “backup” extended pubKeys in case of address overflow. Still, the problem remains that generating a new address for each visit is infeasible. You should seriously consider the IP-mapping approach.

It will take a couple of days on that computer to download and verify the full blockchain. Just be patient.
In the meantime, I recommend you further assist the bitcoin network by Port Forwarding to the bitcoin network (8333). This will allow others to connect to your bitcoin node and retrieve data. Contrary to popular belief, if you do not open port 8333 you will not be assisting the network.
You can find out how to Port forward by googling if you’ve never done it before. Be sure that your device has a Static IP Address (aka does not change) and that your External IP is also static.

A pruned node is able to validate new blocks and transactions, as well as propagate them across the network. What a pruned node Cannot do, however, is help new nodes get onto the network.
Archival (Full) nodes are able to bootstrap other nodes that do not have the longest chain starting from any block height. Pruned nodes are only capable of serving the blocks that they are aware of (between 0 and 550 blocks most recent blocks).

I get where you’re coming from, and it’s a valid point. In the future when block subsidy drops near 0 and all reward is in fees, transactions will get expensive (even if ignoring fiat value). Fees are based on byte size of transactions, which have a defined minimum bytes necessary to describe them. Currently, the most used transaction type of 1 input 2 output are [~250 bytes]( using a fee rate of 1 sat/byte this becomes 250 sats minimum for transacting with bitcoin.
Let’s say that when a single bitcoin is worth $1,000,000 (if it’s even still relevant then), a single sat would be the equivalent of $0.01 . Now a single sat isn’t much on its own, but 250 sats say for an item worth ~$3 (300 sats)? You’d be paying almost half the cost of the item in fees alone - 550 sats total! Obviously there is the Lightning Network, allowing for millisatoshi transaction fees and payments, but layer 1 will still need a relatively high volume of transactions to reasonably accommodate enough miners to secure the network.

Appreciate it, I’ve implemented BIP 39 in Java but it’s been awhile. Doesn’t change the fact that the last word is always comprised of a checksum though. However you make a good point in that you still need to test the 2048 words to find which checksums are valid.

So the problem with this is that Electrum has double encryption on wallet files. The first encryption takes place on your private keys, which are encrypted with your wallet file password. Then the public information (such as extended public keys, addresses, known UTXOs, etc) and the encrypted private information is encrypted again with ECIES (a combination of Diffie-Hellman key exchange and ECDSA). You’d first have to brute force ECIES, but then I suppose you’d have the password at that point and could simply decrypt the Private data. 
That being said, at the end of the day it only matters how strong the user’s password is.
Edit: the double encryption is primarily to combat malware attacks, where your decrypted wallet file is exposed in application memory.

That’s it, it just stops after opening the LevelDB?
Interesting. You may want to try reindexing, this could take quite awhile. Did you sync the blockchain on a different computer beforehand and are using an external hard drive to store the block data?
I also noticed you don’t have a bitcoin.conf file setup and it’s complaining about that to you.
Edit: how long has it been on that same LevelDB obfuscation key line? If it’s only been a couple minutes, don’t worry about it. If it’s been a day like you’ve said, something is wrong.

I think the biggest reason why everyone is hating on the Coinbase wallet here is the Privacy and Trust implications.
1) Privacy - the Coinbase Wallet app forces you to sign on to your Coinbase account to use the wallet. In cryptocurrency spaces, this is considered a **huge red flag**. Coinbase now has knowledge of all of your funds, where they go, and where they came from. Note that this only matters if you really don’t care about privacy and trust Coinbase as a company to not maliciously use your data.
2) Trust - the Coinbase Wallet app is **closed source**, aka proprietary software. The code is not published anywhere for outside review. Even on the [official website]( the link for Developers is broken. This means you have to rely on Coinbase developers to not make coding mistakes, or implement backdoors, and there’s no way to verify that things are operating as they say they are (for ex, they may actually be storing your private keys on a centralized server). Note that this really only matters if you trust Coinbase as a company to not steal your funds or make a huge fuckup with bad crypto/implementation. 
All in all, this boils down to one thing: **Do you trust Coinbase?**

How does this apply to bitcoin though? The article states he’s resetting people’s multifactor and hacking into their emails. But from what I know and have experienced, bitcoin isn’t on your email or associated with your email in any way. It’s secured by your 12-24 word seed phrase that derives your private keys in a hierarchical manner.
Unless he’s stealing bitcoin stored on exchanges, which you shouldn’t be doing in the first place.

My biggest problem with lightning and the argument of “low-to-no Fees” is that miners will not have an incentive to find blocks. We can’t rely on the block reward, as eventually it will decrease to 0 or at least so small that it won’t matter.
If fees decrease, the only reliable way to have miners incentivized is if the value of bitcoin goes way up. But that also means that your small fee of 1 satoshi would be worth the same if not more than the fees we are complaining about today. This doesn’t support or directly go to miners either if we’re using lightning, since the only requirement to route payments and receive fees on Lightning is to have a full node.
Anyone have any suggestions, ideas, or counterpoints?
@_date: 2018-12-31 04:22:15
You should try using Coinbase Pro instead, it’s directly tied to Coinbase with free and instant transfers to/from the “Coinbase Wallets”. Buying and selling bitcoin (and other tokens supported by Coinbase) is free if you don’t use market orders (aka manually setting the price you want to buy at rather than buying instantly), and it’s only a very small fee (I think 0.25%) for regular market orders. It’s what I use personally and it’s much easier and more reliable in my opinion than the standard Coinbase app and interface.

Thanks for the reply. Yes, it’s not a direct copy of bitcoind, but I’m taking as many aspects of it as possible. I’ve already created a functional blockchain that strays away from the bitcoind transaction validation, but I wanted to try and implement a pseudo version of what’s going on.
I still haven’t created the “Blockchain” class nor the “Block” class yet, since I wanted to start from lower abstraction  components to higher abstraction this time around.
My thinking is that this could be done, but now I’ve reached a roadblock where I need the higher abstractions (Blocks/chain of blocks/entire UTXO set) to be able to validate the transactions themselves. I guess I can skip out on solving the double spending issue until I finish fleshing out those implementations then work out the specifics from there.
Edit: I’m guessing this would work though as I currently have it, since the way bitcoind grabs information about the blocks from a fresh start is sequential, and not all-at-once. My problem arises from having all the transaction history at the start and attempting to validate transactions based on the current history (which in my case would contain only the current UTXOs), rather than building/recreating the data structure from scratch.

When copying over the mainnet chain, there are 3 folders in the data directory. One is “blocks”, another is “chainstate”, and the last is “indexes”.

I second with using Coinbase Pro (GDAX). I’ve been using GDAX for years now and it’s intuitive, straight forward, and no fees. Buying bitcoin from an exchange is the easiest way to get Bitcoin, the other ways would be to mine it yourself (like he’s stated, there are costs associated with maintaining your mining rig that may or may not make it profitable to do so), another way is to use a “Faucet” which are essentially dead since you barely get any bitcoin at all from them, and the last way is to buy bitcoin from people in real life or off a website such as localbitcoins.

I appreciate your opinions about Coinbase, but damn are you toxic as fuck. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 19:04:32
If you want to get your feet wet with altcoins, I recommend setting up a Coinbase account in order to buy Bitcoin with USD (or your fiat of choice). Coinbase has a limited amount of coins, but if you want to diversify you’ll need to move onto another exchange such as Binance. 
The reason for making the Coinbase account is because Binance doesn’t let you trade fiat for coins, you can only deposit crypto. This is why Coinbase is used, to buy some initial Bitcoin that you can then transfer onto Binance. Binance has a huge list of altcoins to choose from, and a very small fee (0.1%) which is even less if you use their Binance Coin (BNB) to pay for fees. 
If you have any questions, ask away. I’ll try to answer relatively quickly.
