I visit Puerto Rico once or twice every year, My mother is from there, and most of her side of the family lives on the island, including her mother; my abuela. We were able establish contact with them after some time and everyone seems to have made it through the storm, but the infrastructure on the island has always been quite poor and this recent hurricane absolutely obliterated what was already a fragile system. There's no telling how long the island will be without power for &amp; my abuela is currently relying on a small generator to power her oxygen machine. I've already heard stories of people stealing gas from other peoples cars, which is worrisome, given how loud generators are. Fortunately, she has a dog (that bites) and her neighbor is a police officer. The inhabitants of Puerto Rico are an incredibly resilient people, family and community are integral pillars of their society and I believe most of the people on the island will come together to help each other. That however doesn't permit us to stand idly by and allow them to fend for themselves in this trying time. That's why I'm starting a Bitcoin-based disaster relief effort.  It's not quite finished yet, will update this when it is if there's any interest.

Oh would you look at that, right there under payment methods: Bank Wire. Neat.  I will try and figure this out - perhaps this will suffice. Thank you stranger.
