You got that right. Satoshi was very wise, Vitalik, not so much.

why would they? most people only care about events in their immediate surroundings that concern them, they have no time to "topple the banks."

that's how the Portuguese took over Brazil and why their langue is still spoken in that country to this day. the Spaniards tried to win militarily and failed.
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:06:44
Yea, that's why there are 10+ new threads about high confirmation times and transaction fees on this sub on a daily basis. LOL
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:05:04


Agreed, but they don't have to deal with all the headaches and costs associated with mining, so like I said before, they are nowhere near as important as the miners.

Totally in line with Trump's character. I believe it!

You want even more hashrate to start hopping between 3 different chains? The mempool on the legacy chain will be hitting new ATHs every single day.
@_date: 2017-08-26 04:58:37
Lot's of people made money on BCH, but now we have two chains and we're more split than ever! The toxicity is at all-time high and so are fees. Sure, you and everyone made a "ton of money," but just consider for a moment the real cost.

Liquidity is already centralized on KYC exchanges. Even the Chinese exchanges had to fall in line. In a few years, there won't be a fiat-to-crypto exchanges that allows any trading without proper verification. 
The only Bitcoin decentralization will be on crypto-to-crypto exchanges.

Nothing in nature is very stable, so why would any of these coins be stable? Stability is like chasing a perpetual motion machine.

What a bad analogy.
Let me know of a company where the security contractors have power to halt operations of the company they are hired to secure. Because that is exactly the kind of leverage miners have over the network. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:51:50
There will always be buyers and sellers for a myriad of reasons, most come and go as they please, while miners make the whole network function, and they don't come and go as they please. The miners make investments in hardware, they make investments in real estate to house their miners, they pay for electricity. 
Investors and buyers can come and go at the drop of a hat, miners do not have that luxury for the most part.
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:36:25
Mr. Lombrozo, with that much money on the line, make sure you yourself don't get bricked.
@_date: 2017-08-26 01:52:20
We got segwit and sky-high fees, pissed off users who are complaining every damn day on this sub, and another bitcoin implementation that is siphoning off hashrate. Yeah, we sure showed those evil miners who is really in charge of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:01:23
Well, when you phrased it like that, let's a have a split every few months then.
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:40:33
The miners have fixed expenses in the millions of dollars on a monthly basis, the users don't. Therefore, miners get a bigger say! You don't get to dictate terms when you have no skin in the game.

Some people have a more long-term outlook. It might surprise you that some of us bitcoiners aren't as concerned with fiat gains as the rest of the get-rich-quick kids.

Isaac and Bless Boahen saved for months to fund her economics doctorate, but when the time came to cash in the investment, they were left empty handed.
The couple are among at least 70,000 investors who have become collateral damage from a cleanup of Ghana’s banking industry. The crackdown, which reduced the number of lenders by a third and saw the closure of 23 savings and loans companies, also triggered a run on fund managers, who couldn’t sell their holdings fast enough to meet demand.
That’s tying up as much as 9 billion cedis ($1.6 billion) of investments, more than a third of the 25 billion cedis in assets that private fund managers oversee for retail and institutional investors.
“My wife was very disturbed,” the 36-year-old said by phone from Kumasi in Ghana’s Ashanti Region. They’re not getting answers and are now worried they’ll never get back the 12,000 cedis they expected back from their investment. “If I knew this would happen, I wouldn’t have gone there.”
They’re in for a long wait. The nation’s markets regulator is looking into whether 21 fund managers violated rules by placing their clients’ money into illiquid assets. The Securities and Exchange Commission has stepped up the pressure, blocking these money managers from accepting new investments for fear they may use the funds to pay out existing investors.
Steady Growth
“The harm has already been done,” Lord Mensah, a senior finance lecturer at the University of Ghana, said by phone. “Assets need to be protected.”
As much as 5 billion cedis is tied up in unlisted bonds, direct private-equity stakes and other deals with small- and medium-sized businesses, according to the SEC. Another 4 billion cedis is stuck in fixed-term investments with banks rescued during the clean up, savings and loans companies, and microlenders.
The SEC hasn’t yet released a list of all the fund managers it is investigating. An 11.2 billion-cedis bailout for lenders that were closed down and another package of about 925 million cedis for microcredit companies whose licenses were revoked is helping to release some of the funds locked up in those segments. The number of fund managers dropped to 140 in 2018 from 155 a year earlier as some voluntarily shut down and the licenses of others were revoked, according to the SEC.
“It’s cutting across all the finance houses and when it happens like that the government needs to step in to build confidence again,” Mensah said. “There’s nothing we can do apart from making sure that we create that necessary environment to regain investors’ confidence again.”
That’s of little comfort to the Boahens, who were going to use the money to cover the costs of field-data collection for Bless’s thesis with the University of Ghana. After being promised a return of 26% a year on the investment, Isaac, an accountant, had to borrow money against his provident fund.
While he got the loan at a reduced rate of 10% a year, Boahen didn’t want to go the route of raising debt, he said. “It’s costing me more now.”

Charlie Lee may not be shorting on insider info (as he claims on Twitter), but I wonder if his buddies got a hot tip today.
@_date: 2017-09-12 19:59:05
I believe Charlie wouldn't lie, but his source may have been compromised. Even Charlie he was 100% sure this leak is legit, there are many, many reasons to sit on it.
For one, a leak of this magnitude will likely be investigated by Chinese authorities, which puts Charlie straight in the crosshairs of the Chinese gov. 
Charlie claims on Twitter that he doesn't have short position on the market, but the source that leaked this info/rumor to him may have had big margin shorts on bitcoin.
What I'm getting at is this: regardless of how trustworthy Charlie may think his source is, how can Charlie possibly know his source isn't profiting off this leak?? This in itself is enough of a reason to keep quiet.
When you're talking potential profits of millions of dollars in the span of a few minutes, nothing is impossible.
Regardless of the what is going on behind the scenes in China, I think Charlie made a big mistake with these Tweets.
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:42:07
Unless his Twitter was somehow compromised, but it doesn't seem likely at this point.
EDIT: Another possibility is that Lee's trusted source may have been deliberately/accidentaly mis-informed by another party.

Charlie, how could you possibly be sure that your source isn't trading on this info/rumor? If that turns out to be the case, you just helped someone do insider trading!
This possibility never crossed your mind? When you're talking about potential windfall profits in the millions in a matter of minutes/hours, just about anything is possible.
