Yes, gains or losses when you convert to dollars or convert in an economic transaction. (eg. I owe John $500 so instead of converting bc to usd and having to pay taxes ill just give him $500 worth of bc. this is a taxable transaction to you. Unfortunately).

This topic has been discussed here and on r/tax. But here is a recap. The IRS can't recognize bitcoin as a currency. They see it as an asset. It meets the definition of a capital asset as defined in the internal revenue code of 1986. Code sec 1221(a). If you buy and sell at a gain then you have a capital gain reported on schedule D of IRS form 1040. This treatment is generally more favorable than being taxed at ordinary rates because capital rates are generally lower. There have been some who believe that you report bitcoin sales on schedule C or that the gain on sale is not taxable at all or even that the US doesn't have the jurisdiction to classify the conversion of bitcoins to dollars as income but these are usually considered frivolous arguments amongst tax experts. Additionally, while the IRS scoring system for audit selection is a closely guarded secret i do not.personally believe that reporting bicoin sales is an automatic trigger

You're taking about the section 1256 election i bet. This is for contacts. If you enter into a futures contract to purchase a set amount of bc you may have to mark the contract to market rates. There are exceptions for hedging contacts and if your contract straddles multiple taxing periods. You're right, that can get complicated. And I'm saying that as a CPA. But for most bc buyers and sellers the normal short and long term rates apply.

Under us law you have to report all your income. There is no below the radar amount... Legally that is.

I'm inclined to think it's taxable only upon the sale or disposition of the non voting shares. But talk to another CPA about it in more detail. It sounds like an otc share of stock that is traded but not over regulated exchanges. I'm not 100% sure i understand this fully. Sorry i can't be of more help. I'm curious to know about it though because many of my clients have made their money in bc and I'm always looking for ways to help them. Lets talk via pm.
