Realistically, I know that we cannot expect the bitcoin community to fund this entire river park to the tune of about 800k, BUT the mere fact that international bitcoiners would even contribute a little, to a river park project in New Zealand, when coins are short, is HUGE news here in our little country. This is absolutely a wonderful story, that shows bitcoin's power to connect people in meaningful ways. Every contribution is a humbling experience for us. I have dedicated my life to river conservation. Fighting greed and faceless corporations is the most soul destroying work. When someone helps, I am grateful; if they are overseas and unknown to me, I am speechless. Einstein said "The world is a dangerous place, not because of those who do evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing." Bitcoiners are DOING something, and it's RIGHT.

All contributions are being held in BTC, for a dedicated Red Bridge River Park Trust. I am a firm believer in the significance of bitcoin to create positive change for people and our planet. Actually, I was the one who brought up the subject of bitcoin when rafting with Gavin, and I am pleased to say that I am working with other bitcoiners in New Zealand to spread the word. The thing about bitcoiners that impresses me most, is that they can actually visualise a better world without deadly interest-based debt-money. As a monetary and jurisprudence researcher, as well as a raft guide and environmentalist, I have grave concerns about the growth imperative built into the truly awful debt-based system. Bitcoin is leading us toward a more hopeful future ...
