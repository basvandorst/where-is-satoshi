Any stock with voting rights means that, with enough stock, you control 51% of the votes and control the company.
Some stock doesn't have voting rights (which I think sucks and should be avoided when you choose your stock), but you still have legal rights as a shareholder and they cannot ignore your ownership interest when they pay dividends. Shareholder lawsuits are quite common if the company ignores them, even when they don't have a majority interest.

This is propaganda.
Stocks (securities) give you part ownership in a company. That includes the land it owns, the IP it owns, its brand name, the value generated by its employees, etc. And the company pays you dividends if it is mature.
Bitcoin gives you part ownership of an idea. That idea has value only so long as people agree it has value. It is made up from nothing, so it could go back to nothing any time that everyone stops valuing it.

OP falsely uses the word "liabilities" in a way that doesn't make any sense. It's a deliberate attempt to make people believe that stocks are higher risk. 
Bitcoin is simply not a safe investment. It is technically not even an investment, it is technically currency speculation. You can make a ton of money through speculation, but you can also lose a ton of money.

But OP is implying that it has less risk than securities. Which is ridiculous.

I'm really not knowledgable about any of that.

I don't think it matters what the government thinks, except for taxes.
My understanding is that the US government treats profits you make from crypto the same as any other "capital gains". So when you sell the crypto for real dollars you need to pay taxes on the profits. But I'm not a tax accountant and you should talk to a real one about this.
