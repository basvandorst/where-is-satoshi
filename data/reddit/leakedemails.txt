Buy the coin, send it to *your* wallet before any other one. Then you'll be good.

I'm looking for a better site myself. Paxful looks great and im excited to try it out.

Sweeeet, i sent you an email!

I wouldn't worry if you send the coin to your own wallet first. Transactions are recorded as a long address, and it isn't linked to your identity.

Hmm, I never needed ID verification, and i have a bank account and debit card set up

They're business wasn't really about bitcoin in the first place. They wanted it to be a paypal competitor all along, which is why it wasn't hard for them to remove their bitcoin option without giving us any warning.

No. Get a software wallet like Electrum, never trust online wallets. When purchasing coins, coinbase tracks the first transaction to make sure the wallet its being sent to is clean. This is why it should go to a software wallet, which is clean. If you do that, you dont need to tumble. Once its in the wallet, then you can send it to alpha.
