I'm having a problem with this. I'm waiting to buy some more bitcoin but if I wait to long to buy it will be stuck on coinbase in there 5 day hold. Could be stuck during the fork.

if you just hold it you'll be in the green no doubt.

The video from this screen shot said a date but I can't recall it now.

Weekend dip¡

How ever much you are willing to light on fire right now. 
 I like the auto invest feature from coinbase. Invest small amounts over time, feel the ups and downs. When a nice down comes invest $$.
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:29:26
This date is very important for coinbase buyers. Less and less time to buy and get off exchange.
@_date: 2017-10-27 12:55:06
Call them. You will be on hold for an hour but call'em.
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:55:22
That ad you read is kinda misleading. It's written as the instant buy feature is active but it's not. 
 Its going to show up. If the gold thing happens you should get your bitcoin like normal. Might have to wait awhile for them to release the gold. Coinbase still hasn't released bitcoin cash. 
 Congratulations on your first purchase!!

Usually. One of these times it won't and a lot of people will miss the boat. One last correction ����
@_date: 2017-10-16 21:47:44
Just called coinbase to ask why I haven't received a email. Customer support said the feature is not ready yet. I read the ad to customer support and he agreed that it's misleading as it reads it a functioning feature.

Give it some time and you'll feel fine with paying 5.7k
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:38:58
It was almost there.

It won't beat visa in today's world but tomorrow is the future.
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:40:53
It's enjoying the view.

Think outside the USA. I a little vacation spot in Baja would be nice.
@_date: 2017-10-16 12:45:01
Now people are holding them longer. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:10:50
I think they are wanting to know if you can take one bitcoin and put it in a small towns bank vault. Then the town would make a new coin that's backed by the 1 bitcoin in the banks vault. 
That's how I translated it?!?

We still have no idea what could happen but we still have naysayers. 
Word of the day naysayers.
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:49:31
I agree with you. There are naysayers against you.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:10:39
If it does hot sub $5k it will only be for a very short period.
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:59:17
Interested in the answer. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:35:25
Try 001-1-888-xxx-xxxx or 001-888-xxx-xxxx
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:19:59
I agree with you but more people are saying this now. Makes me want to buy.
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:39:03
I'd slow down and breathe. The 8 days is going to feel like an eternity. Bitcoin will still be around to buy maybe higher but it could be lower. You investing $150 is the key part.
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:26:56
I read posts like this as all the naysayers when bitcoin first started. You have no clue what could happen with coins in 5 years. Hell what if coinbase started selling bitcoin cash January 1st. I'd say there is a high chance of bitcoin cash enlarging in market cap. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 12:50:56
No bueno 
@_date: 2017-10-27 01:34:50
I was to scared to when bitcoin was $400. Don't be scared.

Congratulations on getting out of debt!
Smart move to also still have 1/2 your stash. Goodluck selling. I don't know about taxes but try to figure that in so you don't go in debt again. Stay debt free.
