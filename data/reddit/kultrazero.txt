It's so cool that so many donations have already come in for him! Very cool stuff.
I've been thinking though, with all the pleasure being taken in the downfall of Leah McGrath Goodman (in other threads, not this one), maybe somebody should set up a donation wallet for her as well. 
A lot of people have been interested in the identity of Satoshi, and a lot of people have guessed incorrectly. Leah Goodman just made her guess in a larger forum than others before her. Whether she was right or not, I don't think she needs to be on the receiving end of soul-crushing internet vegence lol. Let's spread more love!!! I hope she keeps investigating.

End the drug war!

It means that if any telecom wants to crush bitcoin, they can. Anybody who is against net neutrality is crazy.

Nothing says "free market" like being forced to use google and Facebook forever, because nothing else is allowed to load.
