I spent some time reading the basics of the legislation around Bitcoin in countries across EU. In some countries they state explicitly that use of bitcoin is fine until it doesn't interfere with the normal use of local currency. So as long as a bunch of geeks spends time on Reddit talking about hodling it's fine, but it shouldn't become mainstream. That doesn't mean it won't happen but clearly it must be done by much smaller steps than a big tournament or lottery because it must stay off the radar ;)  
   
I think that's also the reason why influential fintech people always talk about blockchain and want to stay away from Bitcoin as currency.

It'll get worse. The [EU funds poorly paid jobs outsourced from west to east]( effectively stranding the east from development.

On kraken it will be possible if the client completes all verify tiers and talks to support. So id, proof of residence and clients photo with the papers at least. Then op should get familiar with local laws. In some countries getting large amount of bitcoin has to be screened for potential sponsorship of terrorism.

That is interesting. I agree it's better to do the thing that feels right even though you don't "need it" immediately rather than being pushed by current external circumstances. People who buy sh*t are usually pushed like this.
