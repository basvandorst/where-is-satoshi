I would love to learn in detail how you turn a private key to a public key. How is the SHA-256(Secure hash algorithm) done? How do you make a point multiplication?

You can carry around paperwallets.
People with an android can scan the bitcoinaddress and se how much is in it, they can also import the private key from it and then send it to themself.

It needs to begin with an X to mark that it doesn't belong to a country.

But there must've been som poor souls who though they were buying at current price but instead bought what you were selling, right?
.. but i guess they we'll be rich souls in the future anyway, he-hehe

Hm... I don't get it T_T
@_date: 2013-09-17 07:49:00
I still don't get it. I mean who would sell you those bitcoins at that low price?
@_date: 2013-09-17 16:45:03
What? Where are you getting that?
I assumed it when i read this:
Hmmm... Too bad there's already an XBC. Could cause confusion.
My mistake.
also, what is XBC?

But, once i have the pub key, can i send bitcoins to it and then spend it with my private key? What are bitcoin addresses used for?
@_date: 2013-09-17 12:30:55
So you sold piddly amounts of bitcoins on bitstamp for cheap and coinbase somehow mimiced that price, right? It sounds wierd.
Aren't the ones buying and selling bitcoins supposed to decide on the price?
When you bought bitcoins, who sold them? Did you sell them to yourself?
@_date: 2013-09-15 09:37:04
Maybe they have invested money in bitcoins
@_date: 2013-09-17 16:45:19
damn, how do i qoute the right way?

If 9 out of 100 people knew then we got 91 people that can get right by chance. 91 / 5 = 18.2. Thus: 18.2 + 9 = 27.2.

The dirty secret is that productivity improvements are lowering the prices of all goods, not just computer stuff. So monetary inflation is not only bringing prices up, it is also offsetting the natural fall of prices brought on by higher productivity and technology.
You sir, are a genius

That's very clever.

And Copper has the symbol Cu (Cuprum). It is in the same group in the periodic table as Gold and Silver.
Copper got its name from Cyprus, it was mined there during the roman era.
