I would guess that big finance is definitely eyeing bitcoin (and other cryptos).  I think the 2.7% on cc sales is a small percentage of what the banks stand to lose.

Many exchanges batch transactions, so they're sending you and 20, 30, 40, whatever other people coins.  That means the miner fee can be spread out across those 40 outputs that are part of a single transaction making their lower withdraw fees feasible.

The blockchain is just a record of transactions.  Lets say there were only 5 addresses: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 and each currently has 1 hodlcoin (this could be bitcoin, litecoin, whatever/etc...).  Furthermore lets say there are only three people involved, PersonA controls address 1, 2 and 3 and PersonB controls address 4 and PersonC controls address 5.
PersonA owes PeronsB .5 hodlcoin and PersonA owes PersonC 1.5 hodlcoin (so a total of 2 is owed).  PersonA currently controls 3 hodlcoin, although it is spread out across 3 addresses.  They could make one transaction that send .5 to PersonB and then a separate transaction that sends 1.5 to PersonC, but the way the protocol is written they can just as easily make one transaction that sends .5 to PersonB and 1.5 to PersonC.
At a slightly more technical level a bitcoin transaction is made up of inputs (addresses and whatever balance they have) and outputs (addresses and whatever balance they will have after the transaction).  The most simple case to think about is a single input and a single output, where all value is transferred from one address to another.  But for a computer it's also easy to make a transaction with a single input and 40 outputs, or 40 inputs and a single output, or any kind of mixture of inputs and outputs.

As mining becomes less profitable, some miners will stop mining.  This will cause the network difficulty to adjust (so the remaining miners will still keep the network going at the target 10mins/block rate).  Those remaining miner's will the get a bigger slice of the reward pie.
What I'm getting at is that even if/when rewards go down, economics dictates that a new equilibrium point will be reached with some miners exiting and those that remain getting a bigger slice of the smaller pie.

I've posted  before as a meme, but I'm actually building tools there now.  The price quoter there now lets you price just about any crypto in any other crypto.  as well as USD and EUR.
The data comes from the CryptoCompare API.  Let me know what you think!

I think the word "coins" is a bit overloaded in the crypto space.  Anyways, glad to help!

It's hard not to get caught up in the FUD when it's 1000s in fiat, but percentage wise we're doing just fine!

To be clear, in this context coins means crypto wallets on the ledger (like LTC, DOGE, VTC, BTC).  OP is not saying they have 4 BTC on the ledger and can't hold anymore.
So if your ledger has BTC, DOGE, LTC and VTC and you wanted to add ZCASH, you'd have to delete one of those four "apps" and then add the ZCASH app.  This doesn't delete your coins, just makes them inaccessible until you add the deleted app back.
