Perhaps initial cost does not equal initial value?

More accurately, the blockchain is a record of who mined the most, along with all the transactions. However, people mined at different efficiencies; not every block solved required the same amount of energy. Some were solar powered GPUs (could be expensive if not an existing system), some were high efficiency FPGA, others ASIC, etc... I wonder if the community would treat a "green" or "carbon neutral" bitcoin different from a regular one. I don't know if there's a way to discern how much energy was required by just looking at the blockchain.
There's nothing sci-fi or magical about bitcoin; it's math and  logic. Nothing more.
The transformers stuff, save that for r/transformers. I like your creative thought process though, however inaccurate.

I feel funny equating initial cost to initial value.

You do not get your coins at the price they were when you hit buy. I just tried to buy some and they said, since they were over their daily buy limit, I'd have to wait and purchase at market value FOUR DAYS LATER. Fuck that shit.

Blockchain forks, simply provide a more robustly coded installer for the wallets to prevent... accidents :cringes: No replacing of routing hardware or  flashing new OS builds. Nice and simple. The solution scales up, too. 
Additionally, I only meant to say the relationships are similar, not 1:1. I could probably write a couple of paragraphs but, meh.. I simply am trying to show that having BTC is as useful as having an IP address.

But there are a fixed number of whole bitcoins, right? I know it's not a perfect analogy... The finite-ness of the IP address range is kinda like the finite number of whole bitcoins, at least in my head. Doesn't mean it's correct though.

I think value is always dynamic. I can make a widget, and without demand, it becomes worthless. The initial cost doesn't ever disappear either. I think this definitely shows that cost != value.

Whats even worse is how much the banks make off of you. They potentially can make upwards of 15% off of YOUR MONEY and they throw you a bone as thanks.

Can we really _know_ anything maaaaan? Ya dig?

If anything, I think a safe analogy of IPv4 to IPv6 in this scenario is when the blockchain forked. Again, not perfect, but we're not comparing apples to apples here..

I'm tellin' ya, bitcoins are just like IP addresses as far as utility.
