I did rephrase everything in my reply to him. I hope it is clearer. But the easiest way is to download the client and play with it in the testnet to see what gets mined what doesn't. :)

If legacy chain is shorter it is equal to BIP148 chain, hence no replay protection needed as there is only one chain.


Send to legacy with timelock, wait until it is being mined. Only after that you send to BIP148 with sequence value being made final.


Pretty much, yeah. It would be clearer if you actually uses the program since 


Fixed. Sorry about that. I tend to be slightly dyslexic about dichotomy. 


Vanilla Electrum actually intend to give an option to switch to BIP148. 
Mycelium also indicates their support before.
Unfortunately they haven't yet released the instruction.

Yep it works that way. If you run your own server you don't even need to switch server.
