This statement is the perfect strategy to try to put the BTC price down and then (mtgox) buy back the BTC or just shorten their loss.
Blame the protocol, price goes down, buy BTC back and then say "hey everyone, we are back, you can now withdrawl, thanks"

I do. Send me a contact email or something

These are the exact symptoms of a cash flow problem in almost all of the cases. Doesn't look like a technical problem at all.
@_date: 2014-02-26 09:46:02
Yeah, both cases are so similar, even in those small facts.
If the pattern continues, next thing will be a huge "Karpeles tell it all" interview in a few months, in which he says a lot of "i dont knows" which no one will believe.

Not necessarily 20-30% of the customers, but just 20-30% of the funds. Could be just a few big customers

It looks like everyone who got this email *does* have an account on mtgox. A phishing attack would also hit thousands of people who doesn't (yet we didnt get a single report of those)

From my understanding he has a 1/23748923749823749324 (some tiny number) chance of seeing a profit if he happens to luckily solve a block, am I right? If so he does have a chance - probably worse than a lottery ticket, but still a chance.

Is the lifespan of a usb stick long enough to hold data as sensitive as this?

It amazes me how they still try to convince us that they're helping fixing OTHERS' problems, while no one else had the problems only THEM had.

What is weird is that at this time we have no public word from people working at Mtgox (staff or not), nor people leaving the company, which we usually would have in a sinking ship case like that.
Which leads me to think that there's something else going on there that we still dont know.

Read any of the other 3.976 threads about it.

VirWox accepts Skrill, which accepts CCs. 
Works smoothly, but VirWox's fees and rates are really high (and confusing, since you have to first convert your USD to SLL and then SLL to BTC)

Im not saying he should be chatting anywhere instead of IRC, Im saying he should be working.

This guy works in an investment firm and he thinks he has a clever advice based on something thats "all over the news"

I still can't understand how someone can have time for IRC chat in the middle of a billion-dollar mess.

Got phishing emails here too, and also a few bizarre 99999 btc payment requests.

I tried to use the one in Vegas but as I'm brazilian it didnt recognize any of my IDs (although the confirmation code did reach my brazilian phone quickly)

Satoshi could own the rights to the Bitcoin name if he wanted to, and it would still be a decentralized currency.

So he's running a company on the middle of an almost a-billion-dollar-crisis and yet he has time to chat on IRC and post funny pictures and links?
While officially the company doesn't say anything.
This is just like if Howard Lederer was seen playing $10 tournaments on Pokerstars in the middle of the Full Tilt Poker crisis (which, btw, is in many ways similar to this one)

The always given explanation of "because ccs are reversible, btc isnt" isn't the real reason here, or else absolute nothing could be bought with credit cards.
The real reason has more to do with the fact that credit card companies doesn't want to deal with btc (and/or shady exchanges).

Wow, so in the US anyone who knows your account number can operate it and transfer your money?
And a lot of people in the US still talk about Bitcoin being insecure because "someone can steal your files"?
@_date: 2014-02-28 13:02:19
I understand this, but chatting there isn't what's gonna solve it.

I also have never read anything on reddit before bitcoin hah.

Looks like Mark finally let someone else write a statement.
