Who cares if Amazon accepts Bitcoin right now? It would make zero impact on their bottom line -- there aren't enough consumers who have it. We should be lobbying them to SELL bitcoin instead.

That's incorrect. They are using multi-sig tech internally, but they are holding all keys, like Coinbase and other off-blockchain wallets. There is no browser-based key or user-controlled backup key as in an on-blockchain multi-sig wallet like BitGo.

I prefer BitGo, which does 2 of 3. No HD wallets yet, but I believe they're rolling it out soon.

Yesterday, the all holders of bitcoin collectively wanted to hold $10B worth of bitcoin. Today, all holders of bitcoin want to hold $25M less (because the FBI no longer wishes to be a holder). In theory, the net impact on the price should be proportionate: 0.025%, or about $2. In practice, the price could do anything in the short term, as always.

I haven't tried the product, but I don't think that's right based on the demo. In the video, while Jeremy was demoing, his initial balance fluctuated from $10 to $10.01 as the price of BTCUSD changed.

Inept, or fraudulent. If you had a giant hole in your balance sheet you were trying to hide for a long time, or taking other shady actions, having no source control would be a great way to destroy evidence. And being the only one with access to push the code would mean no other eyes on what you were doing.

I think the "gold stocks instead of gold" phenomenon is more related to it historically being easier to invest in gold stocks in the context of a brokerage account. The existence of ETFs like GLD, IAU, etc. has definitely changed that. Also, your analogy would really only apply to the GLBSE if you first had to buy gold coins in order to buy a stake in a gold mining company.

For that amount, I wouldn't even bother going to MtGox, unless you're already set up there. I'd first look on localbitcoins.com to see who's selling locally, and just make an investment for cash. Or, you can buy $100/day using coinbase.com, which will cost you 1%, and will also help spread out your purchases to even out any price fluctuations.
Once you buy your BTC, do NOT let someone else hold it, including MtGox! Do some research and learn how to set up a client like electrum, blockchain.info, or even a paper wallet to hold your BTC securely for the long term.
Good luck!

The whole GLBSE phenomenon is pretty amusing to me. We have this amazing new innovation, Bitcoin, with the potential to be hugely successful and transformative, in which YOU CAN INVEST DIRECTLY. The currency itself is not even 4 years old, yet so many people are not content to just invest in BTC directly -- they feel they have to "put it to work" by investing it in the extremely high risk businesses being run on top of Bitcoin. BTC and USD are freely exchangeable -- so you should really be asking yourself, of all the possible DOLLAR-based investments available in the world, what are the best opportunities for investment? Would anything available on GLBSE really make the list? Bitcoin itself is a different matter, but I think many people don't see the vast difference between a buy-and-hold investment in BTC and the pissing away of capital on fly-by-night businesses.

Do people take out loans denominated in ounces of gold? For the most part, no.
So don't borrow in bitcoin either. Problem solved.
Fiat currencies are for borrowing. Hard currencies are for saving.

Did you ever use the website version of blockchain.info? If so, and you have it bookmarked, you can access them there. Did you set up email account associated with your wallet? If so, you should have gotten email backups of your wallet. As a last resort, you could try contacting the owner of blockchain.info (Ben Reeves) and see if he can help you retrieve the copy of the wallet stored on the blockchain server (which you can decrypt with your password).

The other question is why all 4 of those txouts needed to be included in the inputs? Either the 20 BTC or the 10 BTC txout would have been sufficient to send 3 BTC.

Have you considered open-sourcing the full version of the app, so that it would be possible to install by being an Apple developer, rather than having to jailbreak the phone?
@_date: 2012-07-17 18:04:28
Not sure if blockchain.info maintains records that link an address to an account identifier or not. If they do, they can recover your wallet. But you'd definitely have to remember the password.

I appreciate that these companies are spending the money and effort to have a bitcoin presence at CES, but does it bother anyone else that this booth really blurs the distinction between bitcoin and bitpay? For example, "Internet payments as low as 0.99%"... um, how about 0% for bitcoin itself? I don't see that mentioned. The bullet points about bitcoin are sitting right next to the bitpay logo as well. If I saw this booth, I'd think there's a single company that had a suite of payment services, including 2 called bitcoin and bitpay.

I think in this new version of the app, that number represents the number of BTC in the unconfirmed transaction pool. It beeps on every new incoming transaction.

"Krugman is Evil"
I come now to talk not about macro but about Krugman.
So far almost all of the Krugman discussion has been positive economics -- is Krugman actually right? And I have to say that I'm still deeply unconvinced. To be successful, an economist must be both intelligent and be right. And it remains completely unclear that Krugman is actually right about many things.
I have had and am continuing to have a dialogue with smart people who are very high on Krugman -- but when I try to get them to explain to me why Krugman is right about some topic, they always seem to come back with explanations about how his work on international trade won the Nobel Prize.
But as I said, this is a positive discussion. What about the normative economics?
Krugman looks like he was turned into a liberal weapon, intended to serve as apologist for the status quo -- the central banks, and the state in general.
Many don't like that agenda, and neither do I; but I am trying not to let that tilt my positive analysis of Krugman one way or the other. One suspects, however, that many Krugman enthusiasts are, in fact, enthusiastic because he pushes the same buttons as their statism fetish.
So let's talk both about whether Krugman is right and whether he's actually non-evil -- in part to make sure that we don't confuse these questions with each other.

Strange... at the time I posted this, the graph showed the 7-day average for the 2011 peak at 148M, but it is now showing it as 177M. So either they changed something at blockchain.info, or there's something buggy in the averaging algorithm.

You should be thankful for the difficulty of getting bitcoin at the moment. The barrier to entry is the primary reason that it's trading as cheaply as it is. Most people won't take the time to jump through all the hoops. Eventually, the barriers will come down, more people will enter, and the price will go up.

Isn't buying S.DICE shares a bet that SatoshiDice represents a growing fraction of the overall bitcoin economy over time? If you believe in bitcoin itself being very successful, that seems like an exceptionally bad bet to me, given that SatoshiDice currently represents something like half of the transactions on the network.

Very impressed you took the time/effort to reach out to Reddit. I would like you to know that every day that goes by, the barrier created by the patchwork of 47 state-by-state money transmission licenses is causing the US to fall further and further behind in the global competition to build deep liquid markets for Bitcoin. US-based exchanges now account for only about 2% of global trade volume. Meanwhile, where are the new exchanges opening? China, Singapore, Canada, and elsewhere.
