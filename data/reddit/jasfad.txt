Wow. That really sucks.

Yeah I heard they’re on back order. Hopefully it comes soon...

What you’re looking for is a hardware wallet.

It is impossible to predict the future. People who makes projections are guessing. A few will be right but only because of chance.

I mean one of the satoshi-mined blocks shows movement. Basically, he proves he’s alive and watching.

How many?

Yeah I think that’s probably the best way to do it at this point. Was hoping to make it completely automated but may just have to do the transaction manually myself.

I see. So it sounds like users will have to solve the crossword and generate the mnemonic phrase, then manually use that to gain control of the wallet and send themselves the funds. Just wish there was a way to do this programmatically with BTC... one click of a button and it’s done. Appears there’s not a way to do it.

Is there an API that could do that for a user? My application is basically just a very thin layer of weak security that allows users to solve a crossword puzzle to gain access to the funds... trying to find a way to automate that.

Cool I’ll check it out!
