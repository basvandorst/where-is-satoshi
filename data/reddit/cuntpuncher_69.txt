The fact that my money almost was almost doubled a month ago and today I’m barely breaking even definitely doesn’t make to feel like a rebound.

Haha no that was before i was invested i was like goddamn i need to buy in but didn’t have PayPal set up and didn’t want to give out my ssn. But we are at 10k now, i worry about if theres going to be a final spike and die out, nothing is permanent 
@_date: 2018-01-27 02:31:22
Haha oh i remember the swings, i regret not buying in at the $300 crash because i didn’t have much money and it was more of a pain to buy than now. Tbh idk if i was ever in bitcoin for the long long term, but the next 1-4 years sure. But idk i don’t see it as the end all be all crypto, i think its the first if its kind and the most popular right now but that doesn’t always mean it will win in the end. 
Im trying to remain objective, its harder when you’re invested, i’m going to hold for the near future though.

You must not remember when it was around 20k, then 17k, then 15k, then 14 and now lows of high 9k. I don’t plan on selling but things don’t look good to me right now
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:37:39

Seriously, like grow up. I mean I only voted for the free taco, but still at least I have integrity.

Give me money or else ill think the world is doom and gloom
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:52:30
Doesnt even accept bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:44:06
Oh god id be so happy tbh, id be buying so many
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:36:15
I know
@_date: 2017-11-04 03:02:22
$3 in fees and replacing. Just sounds like more hassle than its worth. I understand for bitcoin to he fly adopted it needs to be used as a currency, but i probably wouldn’t go through that trouble
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:35:08
But are you really gonna spend your investment? Its growing fast, i personal would just use cash since its value isnt growing like my bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-04 03:32:27
Lol never said it was the right or moral thing to do. I don’t think me buying with btc occasionally is going to help the whole ecosystem much. The difference is probably insignificant. Problem is theres probably a lot of people that think that way, its like the whole “my vote doesn’t count” mentality.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:40:08
But thats not his problem

Every time I've heard this it's been wrong
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:00:04
Boy i hope youre right
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:25:58
I think im out for now
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:25:26
Yeah i think im out for now
@_date: 2018-07-17 20:10:08
Wait for it to drop again, it will then buy if youre really in for the long haul. Also make sure youre ready to lose all that money you invest, no one knows where its going
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:06:07
Yeah i feel like an idiot for listening to people on the internet and not my gut. Is bitcoin dead forever? I doubt it but i can definitely see it dropping further and further. 
Someone told me january is usually bad for cryptos but its february and the graphs over the years looked nothing like this.
