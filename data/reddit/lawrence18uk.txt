An excellent point - which sort of explains "how money works" - as this (internaising transactions) is precisely what modern banks do - it's just that things have got a bit out of proportion, since the number of transactions in the "off balance sheet" economy is now about 30 times bigger than the "official" one. (from fractional reserve banking). So as long as we restrict or regulate the activities of things like coinbase, we'll be OK...

Tho hopefully, SegWit will allow more transactions per block if they are coming too slowly? They were down to about 3-4 blocks per hour

In the last hour I saw 50 BCH blocks mined, ie about 8 times too fast. Is there any way to stop this see-sawing? After the next difficulty adjustment, surely miners will go back to BTC...

If you integrated the usd price curve wrt the number of bitcoins getting mined at each point you'd get an answer. At the start there were 144*50=7200BTC per day, but the 'price' was miniscule, thses days there are 1800BTC daily. I was thinking abt exactly this question yesterday, so thanks! A decent database would do it. I agree my suggestion is not at all accurate, but I was hoping the errors might average themselves out a bit.

What I did was to turn down the priority level on the Wallet to "idle" (using Process Explorer or Windows Task Manager) - I also set up a auto batch file to start-up wallet software at low priority

Words are contain their own pitfalls - what Bitcoiners are saying is that there are two languages "English" and "Bitcoin" - they look similar but have certain significant differences. A Frenchman may converse quite easily with a Spaniard except when they get to the word "burro" which means "butter" to one but "bull" to the other. Wars have probably been fought over less.
