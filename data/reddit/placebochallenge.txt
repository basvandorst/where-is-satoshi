Those who completed at least 12 days of the Placebos who are part of the challenge should receive their bitcoin today. If you don't, please let me know!!
@_date: 2014-04-27 20:23:48
Nice! Enjoy the Challenge!
@_date: 2014-05-16 01:29:23
No problem. Glad you're enjoying it!!
@_date: 2014-05-14 23:26:47
We shut down the challenge 24 hours after the announcement. We may again pick it up soon. Unfortunately, we're finding the thousands of people who weren't paid are actually performing significantly better!
@_date: 2014-04-27 17:27:13
When you signed up, there was the option to pay with bitcoin. You need to put in a payment of $1/.00218 btc. We'll then send the payment to the address we receive. Let me know if you have any questions!

While that's of course not at all what we do, you're not so far from the truth. When people pay or pay more they tend to experience better results - whether with Placebos or Shampoo. It's called expectation bias - people associate more expensive with better... and so they experience better. Also, when people pay more for something they tend to unconsciously or consciously use payment as leverage, an excuse to use/do/or achieve the thing. Here's an interesting article that explains more. Its title is, "More expensive pills bring more relief":

Wonderful! 
@_date: 2014-04-27 16:02:44
Sweet :) Please PM me with your username that you signed up with! 
@_date: 2014-04-27 22:52:37
Thanks! We're excited to see you succeed!
@_date: 2014-04-27 17:21:27
Ha... happy to explain this to you. Here's how it works: when people check in everyday to watch the two minute video, they also rate/self report a metric. For weight loss the metric is: "How much do you weight?" For Life Purpose it is, "What % of the last 24 hours have you spent in alignment with what really matters to you?" 
Our data represents the distance people travel between their first series of checkins and their last series of checkins! 
No early organization has the time or funds to get a peer reviewed double blind placebo controlled study out of the gate. So right now our data is researcher-reviewed and compelling enough to NOW be putting together the double-blind placebo controlled study (on Placebos) with UCSD. 
Also, as far as just listening to "ads", that's not what's going on here. It's actually an intricate highly thoughtful series of steps that people are engaging that appear seamless and easy (and even stupid to some), but that align strongly with the research. We were a research first organization... everything you see/experience is based, first, on testing. 
Hope this helps a bit :) 
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:26:15
We do now. Changed our process midstream... and we be will emailing directly anyone who signed up with their bitcoin address to verify that we'll be sending to the correct address. If we lost anything between now and then, we'll own that. Thanks! 
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:41:08
Yeah, it's been a crazy fun experiment to conduct. Really excited to have you aboard!
@_date: 2014-04-27 15:47:33
bitcoin sent to you!

Great question! A prescription, specifically, is 30 Placebos in a given area. Focus is one prescription, Happiness is another, Life Purpose is another. They all have 30 Placebos... of which you will receive one a day!
@_date: 2014-05-16 01:31:09
Sounds wonderful!!! 
This has been such an interesting test of financial incentive. We'll probably share some of the results publicly. Again, the strange or not strange thing is that financial incentive seems, so far, to be tanking efficacy compared to everyone else for *most* people. Not all... but most. We'll interview a subsection of everyone afterwards, but my sense is the ones it's not tanking efficacy for were the ones who didn't have a financial motive in the first place... 
@_date: 2014-04-27 16:30:24
Uhh... is this real? It turns out that the guy whose research I linked to is Ted Kaptchuk, the head of Harvard's Placebo Department. He also happens to be informally advising us. James Fowler at UCSD who is a New York Times best selling author and Gugenheim fellow is a formal adviser and one of the researchers at UCSD who is working with us. Paul King, who is the formal director of technology of the Gates Foundation is also formally advising and working with us.
If you have a specific question about placebos or the placebo effect, I'm happy to answer you. You are obviously quite uninformed. Harvard, UCLA, Beth Israel Hospital all have Placebo departments, and the research is extremely exciting... research we're also involved in. If you'd like me to point you in the right direction, feel free to PM me. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 20:08:05
We're pleasantly surprised that there aren't more of these types of comments here. It says a lot about the Reddit Bitcoin community! 
Just FYI We are partnered with extremely reputable researchers and research institutions. We are also backed by extremely reputable investors. Also, both founders - us - have scaled our own past Silicon Valley companies to a combined over 300 million users. So no, this isn't a scam. This is a heart project that is involved in cutting edge research and seeks to be helpful to people in the world.
@_date: 2014-04-28 00:57:48
Sweet. Great to meet you and good luck with the challenge!
@_date: 2014-05-17 05:50:08
As long as you signed up in the first 24 hours and did 12 of 15 Placebos, you should already have the coins in your Bitcoin wallet!! If they aren't there PM me and I can help!

Well, send us 2.18 mBTC and we send you back 22.5 mBTC by the end of 30 days (in three payments). There is no catch. We're doing some really interesting research and comparing various communities and various offerings - just trying to understand how different dynamics change people's experience as well as their completion rates. 
We may lose money with this, but we gain insight - and right now, insight is what we are most after. Also, we allow people to pay whatever they want. Non-bitcoin people pay ~$8.50 per prescription, so if it's the case that the bitcoin community thinks similarly we shouldn't lose too much money. :)
@_date: 2014-04-27 20:22:06
No offense taken!  
If you think we're trying to scam 50 bitcoiners out of $1 each, we have much better things to do with our time :) Also, as people have already commented here, the early birds already received the 5 mBTC bonus, and everyone who signed up has already been able to take their first placebo/enjoy the product. Do you think we'd risk years of product development to scam a few dozen people out of the $1 we ask for payment?
If you want to see the origins of the project - back in August - here's a link to a Mashable article about us:  There were also articles on many major science and tech blogs. 
Hope this helps calm your worries. Not everything in bitcoin is a scam... and certainly not this :) 
PS Additionally, if you want to use the product and not participate in the challenge - or use the product and test our legitimacy, you CAN sign up for free. Just type in $0 as your payment amount!
@_date: 2014-04-27 17:06:46
Sweet. You will receive the bitcoins via the bitcoin address you gave when you signed up! We'll be sending out as soon as the transaction on your end is confirmed.
@_date: 2014-04-27 23:08:44
NP. Glad you enjoyed it :)
@_date: 2014-04-27 20:55:52
Love it! Appreciate your willingness to try this out. Means a lot to us... seriously. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 18:22:12
@_date: 2014-04-27 21:26:03
It sounds like you were on our internal discussions. That is exactly the conversation we were having after we wrote back to you. Let us know if you have any more ideas/feedback :) 
@_date: 2014-04-27 20:11:02
Good catch. We'll go with the smaller number just in case. And we'll make sure to add pounds to the metric. We do know that 87% of our community is from the US, so perhaps we aren't so far off!
@_date: 2014-04-27 15:51:38
Awesome! Can you PM me with the username that you signed up with?
@_date: 2014-04-27 19:38:28
Virtual... medication :) 
@_date: 2014-04-27 16:25:30
Wonderful! We never would have guessed it, but Focus has been our most popular prescription - beating out Happiness and Weight Loss so far. 1347 subscribers!
Please PM me with your username. Give us a little bit of time to verify the transaction, but will be sending the btc soon. Excited to have you aboard! 
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:40:36
Definitely just refresh. It's loading perfectly over here. If you have any additional problems, PM me and we'll see if we can figure it out! 
@_date: 2014-04-28 01:00:59
Yeah! Bruce Lee once said, "‎The successful warrior is the average man [OR WOMAN], with laser-like focus.” 
@_date: 2014-04-27 19:38:15
The Leadership prescription is new and amazing! Brooks Fisher has coached thousands of Silicon Valley execs, and he's got a talent for taking complex concepts, simplifying them, and making them easy to harness. Enjoy!
@_date: 2014-04-27 22:52:16
We're rooting for you too!
@_date: 2014-04-27 19:58:08
Awesome. You too!

bitcoin sent to you!
@_date: 2014-04-27 16:54:15
That's a great idea for the future, and we considered it. But it seems easiest for us to just send people the bitcoin payments directly to the bitcoin address they used when they sign up. That keeps it clean, and it ensure we don't need to have payments traversing different platforms...
@_date: 2014-04-27 20:54:55
We're excited. Good luck!
@_date: 2014-04-28 02:41:23
Haha, no cult. Just some cutting edge research, a neat product (hopefully), and a bitcoin giveaway :) 
@_date: 2014-04-29 00:53:06
Thanks for writing back to me. Glad it went through!
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:27:27
Thanks for the warning. We've changed our process as a result. We wiwill emailing directly verifying that we'll be sending to the correct address. If we lost anything between now and then, we'll own that. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-04-27 20:44:57
Haha... that's the spirit! We'll be getting and staying focused right beside you!
@_date: 2014-04-27 16:03:05
Yeah, DeliBelly! Please PM me with the username that you signed up with!

We dare you to give the site the Reddit hug of death. :) We should have sufficient server capacity! 
We've actually streamlined the process of dispersing the bitcoin. Now we're just going to send the btc back to whatever bitcoin address you used at signup!
@_date: 2014-04-27 19:57:41
That is strange. When you sign up, it gives you the option to choose the amount you want to pay (it's pay what you want), and then to choose how to pay (bitcoin is the third option). Then it'll give you a bitcoin address that you send your payment to. If you choose that you want to pay $0, then it'll ask you if you're sure. If you say yes, then it takes you to a 7 day free trial (which is forever free as long as you come back). 
What we would recommend is just log back in, click on your prescription and press "Buy now". Then choose bitcoin as a payment option and you're on your way. As long as you make a payment with bitcoin, we'll count you in on the Bitcoin Placebo Challenge, and we'll make OUR first payment to you tomorrow when you log back in. 
If you have any problems at all, PM us. We're here and happy to help!
@_date: 2014-04-27 22:54:45
Great questions: 
1. You can use Kudos to get new prescriptions... and the act of coming back daily (which gets you Kudos) is effective in supporting you in changing behavior and perception to achieve your goals. 
2. Paying is another way of making it more effective - as it allows you to get leverage over your goal - in any industry (including medicine) when people pay more for something they perceive it as having more value. 
Hope this helps!
@_date: 2014-05-16 01:28:50
A mistake from the developer. You should get another .005 today. :) 
@_date: 2014-04-27 22:04:38
Great to hear. It was a bug after all... and we fixed it. Our bad and not yours! Look forward to hearing how the challenge goes!
@_date: 2014-04-27 20:15:43
Haha... um, sure?
It turns out the placebo effect is a result of a variety of factors. Price has been proven to influence the placebo effect... to make it stronger. Price is a form of "suggestion" so we agree with your statement that people are susceptible to the power of suggestion. 
But you're also right - it's been shown that the body can produce more opiads as a result of the placebo effect. That has been studied too! You can look it up now, or we're happy to PM you some studies a little later when we have a bit more time.
Oh, if snake oil salesmen agree with us, that's awesome. So do most of the world's foremost researchers, doctors, and scientists who know anything about the placebo effect! 
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:59:19
You were the third person to say that, and we were wondering why. It turns out some strange formatting on reddit was redirecting the link we're created: placeboeffect.com/bitcoin. So you can no go directly to Placebo Effect.com - you'll get to the same page and be able to pay with bitcoin. Let us know if there are any problems!
@_date: 2014-05-07 02:10:50
It shouldn't be... unless there was some kind of transaction fee in the blockchain. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 18:34:05
Looks like there was a little bug with reminders. :( Fixing it as we speak!
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:42:56
If you were one the first 10 people to sign up, you received a 5mBTC early bird special (those have all been sent out). If not, you'll receive the first mBTC payment tomorrow after you check in, the second on Day 15, and the third on day 30. If you have any additional questions, just PM us. We're here working all day (like most Sundays)!
