Nice dude, I use the Ledger myself. Love it!
@_date: 2017-12-01 08:08:31
It's not only a fault on there part but also why add a 90 day limit, which could and should be indefinite or multiple years. Why do they need a limit? They also state in their terms they have a strict no fiat policy for the company, but then go to explain they liquidate these stolen funds into fiat after 90 days.

Sorry but that's not really art, it's just a drawn QR code on the side of a building. Hiding a QR in a piece of art makes sense, this doesn't IMO.
@_date: 2018-05-05 19:02:53
Yes! 
@_date: 2018-05-07 12:35:21
I don't, considering the picture didn't include the art.

All these BU guys are starting to run nodes to support BU. Once their bandwidth gets raped I hoping some will realise increasing block size might not be the best idea after all..

Yes:  Also check out the nodes page.
@_date: 2017-03-05 22:02:11
Nice one core! This will help low power nodes with their initial sync!
@_date: 2017-03-08 20:25:13
Use ROKOS.
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:10:21
The funny thing is they have no nodes. So clearly not what the users want.
@_date: 2017-03-15 11:53:27
Lets hope they start to realise that!
@_date: 2017-01-02 15:36:45
Circle was great, I wish they would come back.
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:48:53
That old classic! Hmm I could add bitbonkers on the side, always fun to watch. Obv give them a link in the description
@_date: 2017-08-27 21:21:51
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:12:02
Good idea, I definitely want to add some more stats like block height/hashrate. If I change ISP in the near future I'll be able to run a full node again, could use the stats from that.
@_date: 2018-10-02 17:24:32
I watched a video with Mike the other day, very good content, will check this out too! 
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:38:10
Yeah your right I will add that stuff at some point, it's hard to find one that is live/dynamic. I can create a php file that pulls json data and refreshes, just need to style it and have the time to implement. Will definitely make the stream better as time goes on and appreciate any suggestions including music etc
@_date: 2017-01-10 23:35:50
Thanks for the thoughtful reply theymos, I appreciate it. Point 1 would definitely need some kind of solution, which by the sounds of it may not be possible. Point 2, surely more 'casual' bitcoin users running nodes due to the incentive is a good thing? The incentive wouldn't be cost efficient for people to spawn a load of centralised AWS nodes, but something fun for people at home to basically have a lotto miner in the form of a node.

49 weeks left to sync on my Pine64 and then I'll be joining the club.
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:34:14
What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-08-14 23:44:08
When I say catch up, I mean so it wouldn't take 5 days to create an RSA key. There could even be a cloud/decentralised server service that you pay for the cloud to create the key for you. IDK just thinking out loud. There will be solutions.
@_date: 2017-01-01 15:05:35
Same here, really want a solution. In the UK, Circle was by far the easiest way to buy BTC.
@_date: 2017-01-16 12:17:18
Had one or two problems, with crashing and not opening client properly. Once I disabled 'allow incoming connections' while it was syncing it was fine. I've just enabled it again as it's synced and now I think it's a DDOS.
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:50:13
This is a great comment. I would assume processing power would catch up in time or another fix would be found. Otherwise everything is broken, HTTPS etc.
@_date: 2017-08-26 23:27:47

Also added my lotto/solo miner stats at top :D
@_date: 2016-11-23 19:49:58
Paid 0.00023 fee and was done in 26 minutes. We always exaggerate the situation. If you want it quickish - pay the fee! If you can't afford it then wait! Can you really not afford $0.18 to not worry about a transaction?

@_date: 2016-11-24 14:48:32
Fee too small. I did 0.00023 fee and transaction completed in 26 minutes.
@_date: 2016-11-19 23:09:14
OK thanks.
@_date: 2016-11-24 10:31:36
Pretty sure an unbanked person can afford to wait for the mempool to reduce back down. I want to know what a 3rd world person is buying for 20c with bitcoin? It doesn't make sense, they have/can afford a phone and internet but somehow need to use bitcoin instead of the local currency? I can see bitcoin being used when moving funds from countries and escaping places where banks are seizing funds, but at that point you would happily pay 18c fee for 26 minute transaction! Bitcoin isn't a privilege or right to anyone, security and decentralisation has a cost.
@_date: 2016-12-26 18:37:50
Nice one CK!
@_date: 2016-12-23 18:10:35
Installing on my Pine64 now. Hopefully the 2GB RAM should make it better than the Pi?

Circle is the best. Pay with debit card and withdraw to debit card. Cheap and fast, can't complain at all.
@_date: 2016-12-24 15:59:10
Another shame that Circle has gone :(
@_date: 2016-12-15 11:46:08
When's the firmware due for release? I think users should at least be notified of this problem..
@_date: 2016-12-26 12:31:46
No, it is limited. Otherwise you could say that about anything.. that car is red, until it's painted blue etc. The code limits it to 21 million, if the code changes who would even agree to it?

@_date: 2016-12-20 22:38:04
Just spend, replenish, HODL, repeat. 
@_date: 2016-12-26 18:51:30
What I mean though, is you don't go around putting the word 'expected' in front of anything that's a current definite. I don't introduce a guy called Simon and say 'you'll meet with Simon, well I expect his name will be Simon in the future when you meet'. You use the word expected on figures that have variables, things like MPG, the expected miles per gallon is 40. With bitcoin the market cap IS 21 million - it's not expected. Yes not technically impossible, but again you could say that about anything, therefore the word expected shouldn't be used.

The classification of a millionaire in this example, are individuals that have net wealth/assets over $1 million. As there are only estimated to be 33 million of these individuals in the world, they all can't own a whole bitcoin.
It's got nothing to do with the price of bitcoin at all, but the supply.

It's just a marketing ploy. They wouldn't do this if they had volume as it would lose them money.

Not good, hope they finally sort it for you. I looked at the BTC cards but none of them had an incentive for me, and were quite costly. I assume they are more suited for people who travel abroad.
@_date: 2018-11-15 22:37:42
They will never learn.

Just pointing out that some don't mine empty blocks on principle, and funny it's from the "blocks are full" gang. Also positive there are transactions in the mempool as it was 1 min 30 secs, so not sure what happened there, it wasn't like it was 2 seconds after the previous block. Block 478104 and 478105 were 6 second apart, and the second block has 662 transactions.
