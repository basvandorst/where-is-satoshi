But he *could* have been the exception if he decided not to sell and the everyone else did what they did... that’s why it hurts.

BTC will be the major/global currency and USD will be useless. 
When and if BTC is that valuable, we’ll stop comparing it to other currencies because BTC is the only/majorly relevant currency in the world. you’ll buy things and pay for services straight up in BTC.

Are you kidding? Let’s be realistic: Say you’re in the room in this pic. You can take one or the other.
Are your chances of securing and transporting the gold on your own not, like, really bleak? 
I’d absolutely take chances with the BTC. Even if the price takes serious loss before I can sell/diversify, I’d definitely come out with the better part of $1B usd, if not much more.
I wouldn’t know where to start with Gold. I’d need to hire a couple armored vans and private armed security. Amongst many other things to keep it safe when I move it to its storage location, which would be hidden and/or guarded well.

For real. Is there a serious bitcoin discussion place/subreddit?
I get tired of seeing snide, contrarian remark after snide contrarian remark from both sides here.

Solution was:
I exported my private key. Imported it at omniwallet.org. Then the USDT showed up. Then I sent it to an exchange.

Does that mean I can access/recover it?

I'd never even heard of it before today. No idea how he messed this up.
