I hate this quote. Because its not really everything. You could have said the same for Enron and Blockbuster.

Its because the higher the price the more people are in bitcoin. So at 20k you had more money involved and more people involved. So its a loss for many many people. But when it went up to 10k everyone made money. Rarely anyone lost money.

Venmo works perfectly well at this. Why can it be similar to venmo?

What do you mean it will not work? And we learned this over the last several decades?
It works now and everyone i know uses it. Its fast and quick. And it does what bitcoin does but its safe and no fees. 
Bitcoin has to compete with this processing system and it can not right now. Its not fast, not as safe, not as user friendly, and not free.

Yeah i moved money from coinbase to another platform and fees upon fees and then when they converted it to cash I got different exchange rate.

I used to like the guy a lot because he seemed upfront and honest. But a lot of the times he was totally wrong. Hes smart but cant pick winners and losers on stocks. He is going about it the wrong way in many cases. He even states this himself. Same with his starting a business idea. He said sit down and think of 10 ideas and just keep doing that each day. That doesnt start a business. I dont know anyone that did it that way ever... thats completely the wrong way to start a business. 
I used to like him on yahoo finance but not so much any more. Its more puffery than facts or real honest opinions. :(

Duude i am so with you on this. This whole new thing of him advertising on facebook with clickbait stuff... sad he turned to this stuff. I really like the guy and i feel hes going down the wrong path.

Where will the price be in 6 months? 1 year?

I've contacted coinbase and it says it will take a few days to send. Not sure why they are doing that. They asked me to send ID which I did - and they are still saying it's going to take 2-3 days to send it.

Thanks! Figured it was odd because it was in PM. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 14:10:16
Someone PMed me asking me to give him my seed and he can look it up. Is that safe?
