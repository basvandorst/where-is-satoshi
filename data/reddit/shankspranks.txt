There is an app called GitMiner, it requires you pull a small trolley of car batteries and a rack of processors behind you while stay blue toothed to your apple watch.

Think about it, performing sha2, ripemd160,sha2 hashes on all the possible combinations of 130 chars hexadecimal until the public address candidates are found seems relatively easy versus prying out the random point on a curve of almost infinite state space. Maybe I missed the memo but either way this is all sci fi for the next 100 years so its irrelevant.

But if all the miners accepted those blocks then they would just continue mining and creating blocks and the raspberry pi enthusiasts would be stuck in limbo with no blocks coming anytime soon. So no nodes running a specific software don't matter unless they can produce the longest chain of blocks.

You assume that all the users of bitcoin care about what software the miners are using, I suspect they don't and all that the result would be the first ever proper chain split where the less hashpower and shorter chain would have to concede.

I agree with OP one hundred percent, bitcoin is no longer cash its an investment like a share or security. I think if Satoshi had known that he would have kept the block reward constant or increasing to keep the inflation under control.
Think about it, if the rate at which the currency was being issued increased with time then it wouldn't be so much like a Ponzi scheme where early adopters are the only winners and control all the chips.

Why would anyone care that there "public" keys are shared?

Will be around 2 years I reckon, you can count the Litecoin Segwit transactions on one hand and Litecoin has had it for some time.
Probably best to just use an alternative until then.

Well to be specific roughly 8000 nodes would need to upgrade and in fact far less then that as miners only probably operate a portion of those and are the only ones who can create blocks. I don't see a problem with getting 8000 people to upgrade a piece of software in 3 months especially since they are all following the main bitcoin news sites and as audigex correctly pointed out the implementation of this is completely trivial compared to something like segwit.
The main point that is being missed here is that tere is a very specific reason that 2x is not implementing replay protection and that is because they are simply changing the dev teams they employ to ensure the health of the system. And they being the ones who spend the most in securing the system have full right to elect a new team if their current software providers are no longer following their vision.
The miners require more transactions per block immediately to make mining remain profitable and the core path is not expedient enough to allow that. 
Core is maybe not as concerned with an expedited throughput as they live in the exchange world where commissions are gained on trades as opposed to actual blockchain transactions. So from the miners perspective a small group has "captured" their livelihood and they must move as a unit to sustain their livelihood in the best way possible, they have always owned these blocks they produce, and they are continuing in their own direction with or without core.

"Hate on miners" what are you, a crypto thug?!?
And why does everybody have to come down on the miners so much? Without them your coin will get hacked to death.

Nah man its called a public key for a reason, unless u are running drugs or avoiding tax its your identity and you should share it freely
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:31:38
Lol thats ridiculous, sure its a hash of the public key but if u can quantum
Reverse engineer a random point on an elliptic curve then a sha2 hash of a string is trivial.

Please post some pictures of segwit / LN transactions so we can see those in action, thanks in advance!

This derision for Bitmain is bordering on ridiculous, when it comes to game theory you don't want to change the game when you are a few billion dollars in, learn to play with respect for your team mates and work towards a common goal.

What exactly am I looking at and what does it have to do with Segwit? Is there a life-ban for poor taste?

I think if you are a wealthy business owner in China you don't ever want to be on the wrong side of the law as the judicial system is not as democratic as those in the west. These guys want to err on the side of caution and take a step back and wait for government to usher them back in.
Also bear in mind that Chinas government is one of the most advanced think tanks in the world (easily comparable to the US) and this is a very carefully calculated move, it could just be consumer protection or it could be an economical power play, the big picture of which will come to light eventually.

Bitcoin is an investment, not a currency, if you need to transact and not hodl then use bitcoin cash.

Oh please, every single bitcoin block is full to capacity, they won't have to force anything. They should rename 1x bitcoin to BitcoinShares, its not a currency.
