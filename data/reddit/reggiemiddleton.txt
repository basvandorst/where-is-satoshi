I'm at a loss as to what that has to do with there being no truly trustworthy parties...
@_date: 2016-04-08 10:03:12
There's already an entire den of Bears in the EU area. It's not guaranteed, but its's as close to guaranteed as you can get. You see, this is math thing. The ECB just doesn't have the firepower to bail out its banking system en masse. There's just not enough money, and if you print it too aggressively you cause worse ailments elsewhere in the ecosystem. 
Just look at the leveraged asset base of the top 5 banks in just Germany, Italy, Spain and France - the ECB doesn't stand a chance. Even if they did, they've exhausted most measures already. They have already pushed rates way negative, twice. They buy every bogus asset and their uncle. they give cheap loans out of every orifice, LTRO, TLTRO - and despite all of this the banking system is still teetering. The banks are (rightfully so) starting to distrust each other, and that is WITH the ECB guarantees and printing. This distrust is what led to the liquidity crises of Lehman and Bear, and WaMu and Countrywide. Borrow short, lend long,etc... Or don't believe me and build private blockchains around these "trusted parties".

Veritaseum forces full collateralization of all trades. There is no such thing as not delivering on a trade. You deliver fully upfront and math dictates the winners and losers. You can employ digital leverage to increase efficiency of deployed capital, but at the end of the day, you can't gamble with money that you don't have.
@_date: 2016-04-05 23:01:32
It might also be noted that although many of the incumbents say that blockchain (bitcoin) tech will not be disruptive and occur slowly, we at Veritaseum believe it will be highly disruptive and occur faster than anyone could envision. Hedge funds are already starting to trade real value through Veritaseum without their prime brokers. Cool stuff, see

Bitcoin is the collateral. We both put up 100BTC to trade the value of JPM equity, I go long, you go short. 200BTC is locked in the blockchain. JPM goes up in price 10%, I get 110BTC at the end of the contract, you get 90BTC.
We have other aspects of the contract as well, digital leverage (for those who want more efficient use of capital), granular time entrys (think of time-based stop or limit orders), etc.
Keep in mind that we are a smart contracts wallet company, and at no time do we have possession, control or custody of or your private keys or capital.
Here's a tutorial (PDF and video) that walks you through it -

" it follows logically that the legal limit of ~310b euro isn't the actual limit of the ECB's capacity to borrow"
I would hope not, because that would be just what's needed to save the top 2 or 3 banks, including supplying the liquidity to stop the daisy chain effect of skitterish counterparties. AIG cost the US  $182 billion to bailout. The dollar and the EUR are close to parity (down from 1.8 or so), rates are deeply negative, the EU area banks (rightfully so) don't trust each other.
The European banks are leveraged higher than the US banks. That 310 euro you're referring to is a Deustche Bank + 1. How about the other 30 to 50 or so banks who are suffering despite NIRP, LTRO, TRLTO, EFSM and EFSF? With all of these acronyms, the banking system and the macro situation looks downright abysmal with NPLs piling up like flies on feces.
Put a different way, the ECB has thrown damn near the kitchen sink at the problem for years, yet the problem still looks very bad.
If you think there are a lot of armchair economists abound, there are even more amateur forensic accountants and fundamental strategists that fail to look at the whole picture.

"I think it's certainly capable - this is where we disagree. The only question for me is whether or not it is willing. I think it is, but the political situation could change that."
No, we don't disagree on that point. I'm sure the ECB is both willing and able to create more pixie dust out of hopium. Where we disagree is whether it will work or not. Thus far, 8 years after the crisis, all of the ECBs efforts have accomplished little more than nothing, if that much. Saving bad banks simply yields you saved bad banks. That's not a solution, that's an extension of the problem!

You have a taker for your trade right here. Set the peso/BTC contract up (for .01 BTC) and I'll take the other side so you can see how the system works in an actual traded for actual money.
As for why any bank will do this, well its a new revenue stream for anyone who is not a money center bank. It's even a revenue stream for money center banks.

"Q: who inputs the data about the stock market exchange rates, on a per minute or per second basis, into the blockchain? An automated computer at Veritaseum? Which stock market's data are taken for this?"
The wallets monitor prices as well as the server, but the server is authoritative in the decision. The wallets have the monitoring ability in order to provide audit functions over the server.
The price data is sourced from major data providers, ex. Bloomberg, S&amp;P, Reuters, Yahoo, Google).
The stock markets used depends on the tickers you trade. For instance, if you decide to trade French bonds in their native markets, it will be the French stock market, british shares (LSE), japanese, chinese, etc. You have the freedom to exchange any currency exposure you want for any asset exposure you want - hence you can buy Samsung common A exposure in Korean won denomination exposure, USD, EUR, or RMB, or even BTC or LTC.

Actually, UltraCoin is groundbreaking in the arena of applied smart contracts and zero trust transactions. Don't get it confused with the thinly traded altcoin by the same name. As of the current beta, you can trade (peer to peer) BTC against over a dozen fiat currencies, nearly all major (and some lesser known) forex pairs, over 10,000 N. American equity tickers (stocks), bonds, options, futures, metals, real estate (residential and commercial) and even create and execute letters of credit. This is all on a zero trust basis, settling in cash within 6 confirmations on the blockchain, and totally bypassing all centralized exchanges and the requisite risks (counterparty, credit, and others) that go along with them, ex. Mt. Gox, Man Financial, Lehman, etc.

The pure wallet function is independent of our servers. The trading function uses our servers to find other wallets. You can always send your funds independent of our servers as long as the coins are in your wallet and not committed to a contract. If committed to a contract, then you have to wait until that contract's expiry.

"&gt; Q.: Is it technically possible that Veritaseum fills my open order on the other side of the trade and then manipulates the system in a way pretending that the value of the underlying of my trade has changed against my bet?

If yes, obviously I do have to trust Ultracoin that they don't embezzle my bitcoins that are in my orders, right?"
No, that is not possible. Veritaseums is a matching engine combined with an automated method of constructing and scripting smart contracts for the clients.

You're not taking delivery of the euros, you're taking delivery of your profits or losses as expressed in bitcoin. Remember, you're trading exposure to the underlying (through a derivative) and not the actual underlying itself. Thus, all we need to do is make sure the profits are available to you to collect at the end of the contract.

That doesn't matter in regards to execution of the contract. The contract executes according to its mutually agreed terms through the blockchain. You do bring up an interesting point that may have some precedence (I'm not a lawyer). If a small start-up entered into an OTC contract with Monster inc. with terms modified from a vanilla ISDA sheet, does the losing party have valid grounds to refute the contract due to the other's dominant position? 
If that's the case, then any small investor who ends up on the wrong side of a trade can make that argument, and the NYSE, NASDAQ, bond and forex markets can be made into farces.
Just a realistic view, IMO.

From our EULA:
YOU MUST RUN THE ULTRACOIN CLIENT WITH ACCESS TO A WORKING INTERNET CONNECTION WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE END OF EACH SWAP, OR THE TRANSACTION MAY BE UNWOUND IN YOUR COUNTERPARTY’S FAVOR. Exiting a swap requires an electronic signature from your private key in your wallet. If this signature is not provided within 720 hours (30 days) of expiration, or termination in the event of collateral exhaustion, an option to unwind the swap will become available and may be elected by your counterparty. Exercise of this option will place each of you back into your respective positions before entering the swap. Therefore, to capture any profits, it is imperative that you run the UltraCoin Client with access to a functioning internet connection within that time frame, so that it may provide the required electronic signature and settle the swap before the option to unwind is made available. It is your responsibility to maintain access to a functioning internet connection. See the Errors in Processing by Third Parties and Service Platforms sections below for additional details.

I think UltraCoin is for the patient. Definitely not the soundbite driven attention deficit type. It is a derivative layer on top of Bitcoin, not better or worse than Bitcoin, simply an additive to it. 
UltraCoin allows you to trade BTC, hedge it, short it, leverage it, loan it, and a wide variety of other uses.
UltraCoin clients actually allow you to sidestep Bitcoin exchanges such as Mt. Gox and trade directly with other BTC owners, and denominate said trades in any number of sovereign fiat currencies. 
Then there's real estate, hard money loans, rate arbitrage, bail-in protection, etc. but if you're in a rush then this is definitely not the product for you.

That's not true sir. I've given you "colorful words" that answered your questions. I quote you:
"I think if Veritaseum, the company behind Ultra-Coin, goes bankrupt while the contract is running, you loose everything."
You think wrong, and the site is full of information and research that explains how the system works, but you call them "colorful words". UltraCoin uses the Blockchain as the intermediary, so if UltraCoin goes bankrupt (or gets hacked, or gets confiscated by authorities, or gets compromised by regulatory bodies, etc.) you get your funds refunded at the expiry of the contract.
"Effectively, if you buy a contract with Ultracoin, then Veritaseum is the counterparty, as I understand."
Again, you understand wrong. The blockchain is your counterparty. You have a choice of zero trust transactions, or low trust transactions whereing Veritaseum servers are delegated the authority (by you) to enter into a transaction on your behalf. You have complete control over you coins at all times, until you cede that control through a contract, and then you pass that control to the contract which resides on the blockchain.
"So in the end it is a normal trading platform for all sorts of "bets", and "ultracoin over bitcoin" is just used as a vehicle to make this contract.
In the end though, the couterparty is always sitting in the real world."
Incorrect, as explained above. There can be no Mt. Gox, Bear Stearns of Lehman Brothers events with Veritasuem's UltraCoin.

The reason your order failed is because you don't have enough money in your wallet. You are trying to a trade for ~45 cents with ony ~45 cents in your wallet. You have to factor in collateral, swap fees and BTC transmission fees. The fees are relatively expensive, but they do exist. Put at least $2 in the wallet and try the same trade again.

Did you look at the intro video  or the quick start tutorial  ?
Receiving gold means you are taking in the price exposure of gold and paying GOOG means you are paying the price exposure of GOOG. So if gold went up 50% and GOOG went down 50% you will be smiling rather hard because the price exposure your receiving increased materially compared to the price exposure that you are paying.
The expiry will max out in years. Simply type in the exposure amount that you desire, ex. 15w, 300d, 2m, etc. 
If you believe the Argentinian peso will be lower in 5 weeks then you want to sell pesos (ex. short pesos) so you will put ARS=X in the pay field and you want to receive any asset you think will go up relative to the Argentinian peso. For the sake of simplicity, let's say as an American you will want to swap peso exposure for US dollar exposure. So you pay ARS=x and receive USD=X. You can get fancy and pay pesos (ARS=x) and recieve the stock of the funds that are blackmailing the Argentinian govt. let's call ticker VULF (for vulture fund, this is a mythical ticker for the sake of illustration). This way you get twice the bang for the buck if you're right since the fund may go up if it gets paid and the peso will sink if the fund gets paid because Argentina will have to inflate the peso by printing into infinity to make more paper to pay its debts, meaning each individual piece of paper is worth that much less. 
You will put 5w into the expiry box and do a search to see if anyone already has the other side of that trade out for bid. If they don't then you can click create new to make the contract and put it out for bid yourself. I will take the other side of any trade for .01 bitcoin or less for 1 week or less to give everybody the liquidity to see how the system works (that is until I run out of money:-)
I am meeting with some very big global institution(s) next month and I anticipate their involvement in this system, wherein you will see near unlimited liquidity if they do. That will be the best of both worlds, massive liquidity and massive safety.

First, the answer. Since the contracts reside in the blockchain, if Veritaseum goes dark for whatever reason the coins will be refunded to their respective parties after the contract expiry. Veritaseum is not the counterparty here, the bitcoin blockchain is. 
Now, ask the same question of JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley. If they were to go dark for whatever reason, how would Harvard have exited its positions? The answer to that question is found in the customers of Man Financial, reference 
In late October 2011, MF Global experienced a spectacular meltdown of its financial condition, directly caused by improper transfers of over $891 million from customer accounts to a MF broker-dealer account to cover losses created by trading losses.
On October 31, 2011, MF Global executives admitted that transfer of $700 million from customer accounts to the broker-dealer and a loan of $175 million in customer funds to MF Global’s U.K. subsidiary to cover (or mask) liquidity shortfalls at the company occurred on October 28, 2011. MF could not repay these monies with its own funds. Improper co-mingling, or mixing, of company and client funds took place for days before the illicit transfer and loans – and perhaps many other days earlier in the year. According the New York Times, "MF Global dipped again and again into customer funds to meet the demands", perhaps beginning as early as August 2011.[4]
MF Global declared bankruptcy on October 31, 2011, and faced liquidation beginning in November 2011.
According to a trustee liquidating the company after its collapse, the losses incurred by customers of MF Global stood at $1.6 billion because of the debacle as of April 2012.[5] Rolling Stone reported in April 2012 that "nobody disputes the fact that MF Global officials dipped into customer accounts and took...customer money."[6]

Consider yourself in love, because you are wrong. A counterparty is the entity that you are opposed to in a trade or transaction. Ultra-coin does not hold the assets that are associated with the coin, essentially the blockchain does. Ultra-coin does not hold any assets other than the fees it charges for the work that it does. The coins are always in either the possession of the wallet or locked into the the smart contract which resides on the blockchain.
If ultra-coin were to be hacked, the only thing the hackers could hope to gain is the fees that ultra-coin charges because it does not have possession of your coins. It can never be "Gox'd"
@_date: 2014-05-12 14:02:00
But it is in line with the fintech idea. The vast majority of the UltraCoin platform is opensource, but some of the financial IP innards must be closed in order to incentivize the creation and proliferation of advanced contracts. This hybrid idea takes the best of both worlds. This is why Android (hybrid) is more popular than Apple (pure closed) and linux (pure open) on the handset.

Well, if you knew which currency would collapse, you simply go heavily short that currency and optimally heavily long some asset or commodity that would benefit from that collapse. For instance if you think the Argentinian peso is going to zero and you think the USD will remain stable, or at least stable relative to the peso, then you pay (short) the peso ARS=x and go long (receive) the US dollar USD=x. Then you either search for a mathing contract or create your own and put it out to bid.
If the peso becomes worthless and the dollar remains the same or doesn't go down as much as the peso or optimally shoots up, you essentially paid nothing to receive an increasingly high dollar value.

Multisig is used to control funds, and (particularly in the zero trust configuration) Veritaseum does not have the possibility to embezzle funds for it has no control over the funds. Your assertion is not backed by any info that leads to your conclusion.
You are not that critical or curious. All you have to do is download the client (it's free) do a trade for a few satoshis (literally pennies - or you can even use test.net), and track your funds through the blockchain via your public key using any popular tool (ie. Blockchain.io). You can publicly view your flow of funds.
We're a private, for profit company with patents pending. While I'm happy to answer any questions to clarify our product, or even pass you on to our CTO and contracts engineer for a more hard core discussion, their are things that we just won't share for competitive reasons.
I have a public track record in popular media and finance going back over a decade. I have no reason to perpetrate a scam and the business is wide open for examination, up to the point of proprietary trade secrets. If you really want technical info, identify yourself and get in contact with me and I'm sure I can answer ALL of your "realistic" questions.

You control your private keys. They are in your wallet. Our servers are designed to have no control over your funds unless you grant us control, and even in that case we only have the ability to enter you into transactions. You still have full control of your funds. At no time does your funds rest on or with our servers. 
The system was designed to assume the servers would go dark at some point and the client would have access to his/her funds.

This is the natural byproduct of dealing with a heteronomous system. The exchange likely has little say in the matter as they're probably pressured by regulators to tighten KYC/AML. The interesting part is that bitcoin is autonomous by nature, the literal opposite and antithesis of heteronomity. An autonomous system allows you to maintain full control of your assets and disclose only what you want. Bitcoin also allows you to trade freely with each other with greater safety and flexibility than heteronomous systems. See

I will answer as many questions as I have time for. For one, this a financial tool, thus a modicum of knowledge of finance would be helpful. As the video stated, the product is based on the concept of financial exposure swaps.
Instead of answering each question individually (in terms of amount of profits, etc) we will take an overview.
Q1 - IF you enter a deal to short 10 bitcoin, (see The Easiest, Fastest Way To Short Bitcoin  at 500, then you will pay 10  BTC plus the requisite collateral ( you will put in total of 20BTC). If BTC drops to 250 at of your contract expiry, you will have made a 50% gain on your principal, hence you would recieve 15BTC back, plus your 10 BTC collateral for a total of 25BTC. IF you were long BTC (paid USD, receive BTC) then you would have taken a commensurate loss.
You can put in lmplied leverage up by buying and selling currency pairs (see article).
The same goes for other assets (see If You Believe The Oil Bull Market Is Over, This Is How To Monetize It Through Ultra-Coin.com

"And then there's the massive issue of security and compliance. There are a lot of assets that can be traded frictionlessly with digital tokens, but we might not want to do it for regulatory reasons. For example, if you could send shares to anyone and then exchange those shares for bitcoin in the blink of an eye, then you could end up with a company getting hacked and having tons of its shares sold off by the hacker in a non-reversible transaction in the blink of an eye."
No, you will end up with tons of share representative tokens being stolen, not the shares themselves. That is the core fundamental flaw with tokenization. It is not value itself, but a representative of said value. To prevent a bad actor from running off with either your blockchain enabled shares or even representative tokens, there are a variety of methods that can be employed. For instance, a hacker cannot just run off with the assets from a Veritaseum trade in the "blink of an eye". The same methodology can be used elsewhere as well.
"Smart contracts are way ahead of their time, IMO. You're really a pioneer here in recognizing their potential. It's going to take a ton of work to get to the point where we can use them on a large scale. But people like you are bringing us closer to it."
Thank you very, very much. I really appreciate that. Let me modify your statement some. SmartContracts2.0 are here and likely here to stay but the benefits need to be clearly articulated and marketed to the masses. SmartContracts1.0 have been in wide scale use for some time now. Think of MP3 rights management and DRM. Those are essentially simplistic smart contracts and the Apple Store alone (1 company) has already done over $10B in revenue from them, up from $0 a few years ago.

Re:  'catastrophic rollback transaction' - Each contract comes with instructions to roll back the transaction to inception if XX time units pass by after contract expiration and no keys other than the wallet key is presented. This is basically Armageddon insurance in case something were to happen that would take both our servers and the other side of the transaction out but somehow mysteriously spare you. As for how it would look in code, I don't know. I'm not a coder. I'm a finance and idea man. If it's important, I can arrange to have someone illustrate it from an overview perspective.
There are audit functions available but not implemented in the client. Commodity data sources are not as much a potential problem as more bespoke, less liquid data sources. We are considering putting in a settlement delay to allow large parties to dispute data and arbitrate it.
And.. No, these are not representations of value. They are the actual value itself, represented in BTC. If you speculate that AAPL stock will go up 20% relative to the EUR and leverage that wager 3x, if it goes up 20%, you literally have your BTC balance increase by 60% at the expense of the other party.That is 1.6x the actual, spendable assets that you have in your wallet relative to what you started with. There is no need to go to another source to redeem your tokens, because you already have the increased cash amount.

I'm not directing this towards you, I'm just trying to set the record straight and make sure that everyone knows that we're trying to improve the community as a whole.
As for Veritaseum, it doesn't use colored coins at all. Colored coins are iconic representations of value, which means that you are still open to counterparty risk and fraud if trying to represent value off blockchain. Veritaseum trades the actual value itself by programming the bitcoins via smart contracts (bitcoin script) to replicate the nature of derivative contracts. Veritaseum literally eliminates counterparty/credit/default risk through the blockchain.
It is 100% bitcoin blockchain based, no tokens, no altcoins and no sidechains.

Smart contracts are ideal for financial applications where programmable digital currency can act as a store of value. Financial applications are at the core of almost every business transaction. The Veritaseum platform encapsulates the value of anything, whether digital or physical, in the BTC of the trade and then allows you to trade the actual value (in lieu of the tokenized representation of said value) according to various clauses delineated in the contract.
This truly comes in handy when utilities and appliances need to autonomously negotiate terms. ex. Your self driving car (Tesla is selling them now) needs gas.
@_date: 2016-03-04 13:57:31
So... What is the wait time for transactions with higher fees. The fee quoted is currently 2.1 US pennies.You can double that and still be well below practically every legacy transmission system on this planet. Picking a static fee level and then levying the charge that the system is slowing down lacks the same amount of objectivity as measuring median time of transactions that have only already been confirmed.  
If miners are prioritizing fees with a 5% premium to that quite in the OP, then the system could be running just find, with a very slight inflation in fees that still undercuts the legacy system by an order of magnitudes.
I'm just sayin'....
@_date: 2014-08-27 10:21:26

It makes plenty of sense. As I mentioned above,  colored coins are representations of value and not value itself, hence they introduce significant credit and counterparty risk. Veritaseum is a blockchain based swap platform, with gold (or any of 45,000 other assets of your choice) as the underlying. The world of financial engineering is deep and vast. Don't assume limitations,  as there are very few with the right engineering chops at the helm.

Colored coins do not capture and trade actual value. They represent value through tokenization. Our platform captures actual value. If your counterparty loses a trade for $23,000 or 100 BTC, they actual lose the cash, not a representative token they would use to seek redemption for the cash. That is the primary and major weakness of colored coins versus our value trading platform (VTP) - we actually capture value in the blockchain. 
We do use colored coins to represent our tokens though - our intellectual capital-backed tradeable tokens. They are currently for sale here -

The bitcoin network can do a lot more than many think it can. All it takes is some imagination and domain knowledge in the industry the solution is being applied to. We have created advanced smart contracts purely and solely on the Bitcoin network with no altcoins, sidechains or tokens needed - 
I'm not a developer, but a year and a half ago when I was trying to develop the idea of financial smart contracts, I was told by many "bitcoin experts" that it couldn't be done in just bitcoin. Well, they were wrong, and you can trade 45,000 instruments with contracts more advanced than most of Wall Street can offer you with just your bitcoin wallet.

I'm going to engage in this debate for the sake of clarification in regards to risk vs. reward. Let me state now, and in CAPS that this is NOT directed at any one particular exchange or intended to assert that ANY particular exchange(s) are subpar. Bitcoin exchanges are on a fantastic growth curve and I'm happy to see that. What I am doing is debunking certain myths as I see them. With that disclaimer out of the way, let me address your assertions.
You said "The top 5 bitcoin exchanges are trusted centralized web services". How is it that they are trusted? They are private companies that are not even domiciled in the US. You have no access to their balance sheet reporting, funding levels, or risk management/mitigation processes. This trust is not proven, even if it is deserved. We are a pure software concern. You have absolutely no exposure to our balance sheet.
You said, "They don't have to ask users to download and execute binaries, instead they just demand users send their passports and their coins." So, you don't have to execute binaries, you just send in your identification and capital? You say that as if its a good thing, and it is not! It was a necessary thing because users are accustomed to the legacy way of doing things before very recently there was no other way of doing things, but blockchain technology allows us to evolve past this high risk method of doing things - it allows us to evolve into a zero trust or low trust method of exchanging value. Let's contrast this legacy method of exchanging value to our P2P, low/zero trust system of trading and value exchange. 
We have no access to your identification or identity - at all, and don't care to have any. We have no access to your capital - at all - and don't care to. We don't have possession, access, or control of any of your coin. Your capital stays either in your wallet or the blockchain and when in-contract via the blockchain is easily traceable via the push of a button via our wallet which stays on your machine and is never hosted by us. You don't have to be concerned about our servers going down, being hacked, or confiscated because you never sent your coin to our servers to begin with and each contract has catastrophic rollback measures embedded in case our servers are some caught in a bi-coastal earthquake during a global meteor storm. You can't say that about "trusted centralized web servers.
You said, "If I have to download and execute a binary (instead of compiling it from code myself), I have to trust the company releasing it when they promise me there's no malware bundled inside that will steal my coins."
But don't you have to trust the exchange not to have bad agents, rogue software on their centralized server, and airtight security not to steal your coins once you send them in. 
If that's not enough, don't you have to trust their capital adequacy, liquidity, counterparty risk, hedges and management competence, prudence and fidelity in order to get your money back?
How about shifts in regulation that may allow authorities to confiscate coin?
Mt. Gox, Lehman, Bear Stearns, Man Financial, etc. Centralized financial concerns have lost more capital for investors and customers than malware every has, or ever could lose... By far!
In addition, you ALWAYS have the option to trace any and all transactions made through our wallet. It's really just a smart contract aware bitcoin wallet, and it has a trace function that tracks all contract transactions - all of them. Thus, if there were any coins stolen, you'd be able to find out immediately (or at least within the 1st confirmation or two). Here's a live, pending contract from my personal wallet - traced and tracked  This cannot be done with conventional and legacy systems and represents a new level of trust and transparency.

We'll likely open source the client, and/or assist others in building their own clients. We have an API.

Our competition are the Wall Street banks, and I doubt very seriously if they'll open source anything. Thus far, in the entire trading industry, there is not a single open source product (of scale) available. One of the reasons is if you do open source it, the competition will simply take it.

What is your opinion or feedback on Veritas? I thought it a novel idea to package a bunch f smart and talented people's abilities us it to create an asset backed bitcoin token. Right now it's relegated to finance, investment, software engineering and law, but I foresee it expanding. This is what an early adopter said (and which I thought was so cool I had to plagiarize it...

I'll accept that as the closest I'll get to an apology - after all, you totally ignored my question as to which number was bigger, $325B  or $1.653 quadrillion 
Listen, those huge numbers that you are referring to are the underpinning of the developed world as we know it today. When just the SMALLEST of those companies dealing in that circle (Lehman brothers, the smallest at the time) went bust, it almost collapsed modern western finance (or so that's what you were told). If Western Union were to go bust, it would simply be a a headline in the papers for a couple of days. 
By inference, nearly everyone who relies on money in the developed world relies on those "trading markets", which are not only just high volume, but high quantity per trade as well. The movements may be attributed to a small group, but their importance is global in nature and reach. 
Again, this is the point of the entire article. The ECB has much more business in these "trading markets" than they do in global remittances, yet their report focuses on the smaller "scheme" rather than the larger one. 
Does the ECB use remittances and payments to engage in QE? No! Can Bitcoin be used to materially alter the effectiveness of that QE program, essentially hundreds of billlions of dollars of financial force and potentially trillions of notional after the multiplier effect? You betcha! That's what's possible and capable if everyone used one of those UltraCoin bitcoin wallets. The ability to sidestep, and obviate the all powerful central bank!
I'm trying hard to get you to get the gist of the article.

Thank you so very much my friend. 
"I know Overstock was envisioning something like this, how close is the application you have developed to what Overstock planned on making?"
We've beat Overstock to the exposure trading goal, for we have a system up and running right now. As a matter of fact, I can do a trade with you right now to show you how easy it is - for any asset in any asset class from any "major" exchange in the world. 
As for their plans to create a product that issues "cryptosecurities" for companies to raise capital with and go public, we may beat them to market on the technical implementation, it depends on how our funding goes, we need money, so we will entertain any investors :-) We've been working on it longer than they have, but they likely have a lead on the legal work while I think we have a lead on the financial engineering side. It's a coin toss on tech aspect, but I definitely do wish them luck. It's a very exciting and ambitious project they're undertaking and the steward (Overstock CEO) has definitely made his mark - which I appreciate greatly.
See the [public version] of our pitch deck to learn more about what we are doing 
I'll be around for another 30 minutes if you want to do that trade, or you can pick off any number of those small BTC/USD trades levered 50x or the GLD/BTC trade levered 65x. There a few of them just entered and they're short terms so you can see quick results.

When central banks (ie, the world's 2nd most powerful CB) issue reports focusing on Mt. Gox and altcoin scams while the code currently exists in Bitcoin to literally obviate central banks in general, yet there is no mention of such - I think it's safe to say that the true merits of this technology is not really the topic of conversation.
The article is my opinion of bitcoin's capabilities, and the UltraCoin wallet is the most capable wallet (re:smart contracts and value trading abilities) that I know of. If you know of a wallet that can show case the smart contracting capabilities (particularly in the financial realm) to the same or greater extent as the UltraCoin wallet, I'd gladly wax lyrical over that as well.
Further, I disagree with you re: the statement "skipping the step of it's core functions to focus on other, more niche and advanced avenues". The financial instrument trading market is a $1.65 quadrillion market (that is correct - there are no typos or mistakes there) while the payments industry is measured in the low hundreds of trillions. If anything is niche it would be payments. It's just that what goes on in the derivatives and financial instruments space is oft unbeknownst to the lay person. That doesn't make it niche in comparison, though.

This is what I would consider an interesting piece that I haven't seen discussed yet. I have a strong background in investments and valuation. Now that my startup is in the process of issuing tokens via crowdsale, I thought I'd take the time to put some structure to the comparison of the crypto tokens available. In the article I explain our token relative to others and walk through the seven steps I've created to compartively value Crypto 2;0 tokens.
It's not a short read, but for those really into the token space, I bet it will be an interesting read.

I'll do a trade with you now if you wish. Let's make it short term, high leverage (so we can get a quick resolution with demonstrable results) - any asset or combo you desire. Just let me know if you want testnet (demo) or live (real money).
@_date: 2015-03-17 06:04:58
These are not similar products. 
CFDs are much more constrained in terms of flexibility than swaps. 
CFDs are illegal in the US.
Bitshare offers about 16 to 32 exposures, we offer any combination of over 45,000.
Bitshares offers a single asset class, we offer any asset class available.
Bitshares doesn't offer leverage, we offer leverage of up to 10,000x
Bitshares is not an exchange of volume. 
Bitshares is also not bitcoin-based, although that is not necessarily a negative.
There are plenty of other differences. This quick list serves to illustrate my point. In the field of finance where IP is the life blood of profit, open sourcing everything works against you. Be aware that this is no longer purely the realm of software development - the industries are distinctly different. Be that as it may and as I said earlier, we will be working on an HTML5 client, and/or assist other entities in building their own client.

If you were to build a solution (financial,  economic, engineering or legal) using our tech you could use it to pay us,  or you can use it in our applications,  or you can horde it. We probably wouldn't do it for fiat or BTC, too many other things to do,  such as furthering our own stuff.

I was joking about the apology thing, but I see you're a little stiff. As for coming down to the education level and mind state of the average person, I'll try this again - which number is bigger....
325 or 1,653...
It doesn't get much simpler than that. You were wrong in that payments/remtittances were a bigger market and financial assets are smaller and niche. Just admit it. We're all wrong, much of the time. It's part of being human. I know I'm wrong often enough :-)

Absolutely excellent job explaining the capabilities of the system. You were actually being a bit humble, so let me step in. Since this is a derivative system, we don't have limit our selection of exposures to just traded securities. Using the words of a smart man that I know, Ultra-Coin.com trades trades any arbitrary expression of value. That means we can take positions directly in indices - something that your local broker can't offer you. 
So, using your example above, that same lady can hedge her holdings, or more accurately, her transactions in gold by going long (receiving) the volatility of gold ^GVZ and going short (paying) either USDUSD=x (for a pure play on spot gold price volatility) or GLD (to speculate on gold prices dropping - or - she can go long GLD and short GVZ if she feels the currency wars in soveriegn fiat will cause gold to spike without a reciprocal drop in the near term. If that will happen, then volatility will drop as GLD prices climb. If where were to enter into a 10x lever on that trade, the leverage effect would be materially increased in relation to trading one asset against the relatively stable dollar, for she will get he gain for GLD and the effect of a successful short for the ^GVZ, all multiplied by her 10x leverage - of course bounded by the limits she set with her principal and collateral contributions. We have dozens, no, hundreds of trade setups to share, and we and our analysts come up with new ones almost everyday.
There is a "How to trade with UltraCoin" thread being put up in the markets section, but if you wish I can keep pumping ideas and answering questions here if you give me the word. Of course, this will work better on the UltraCoin site where we can do rich text, video and graphics.

Okay, now we're making progress :-). To begin with, we are referencing two different (but highly inter-related) products from my company. 
Veritaseum is is the value trading platform - the "smart contract aware bitcoin wallet". It is "zero trust" or "low trust", depending on how its implemented. 
Veritas is the "software token" for Veritaseum that can be used to purchase products and services - or traded freely OTC or through an exchange. The token is actually backed by the intellectual capital and labor of my team (and even me, see  The example given shows how Goldman could have bought $2M worth of the token and had us build low trust/zero trust solutions into their FICC with a high degree of familiarity with their trading business. That integration would use our Veritaseum API, of course.
Now, if Goldman were to make such a purchase, the aggregate value of Veritas would likely increase due to supply vs demand.
To answer your 2nd set of questions:
"is there liquidity for trades"
We're working on that. The project is still in beta and we're soliciting market makers and liquidity providers. Actually in discussion with sovereign wealth funds. These are interesting times, indeed.
"are my positions automatically hedged"
The are digitally derived derivative positions, thus we have no need to hedge since we are not at risk. Remember, we're software and consulting company, not a financial concern whose balance sheet is exposed.
"how do the smart contracts work?"
See slides 14 and 15 here 
Here's a quick start tutorial for Veritaseum's Value Trading Wallet (the leverage feature is not explained, but its self-explanatory, look in the advanced dialog in the markets tab) 
Here's an Excel spreadsheet that allows you to fully model a trade (P&amp;L, leverage, sensitivity analysis, what happens if BTC drops, etc.) before you deploy  capital (if you don't want to use the testnet/demo option) - 
I look forward to your feedback.

@_date: 2015-02-11 23:40:32
I've been working on it for over a year now, and am assembling a crackshot team.
All we need to start generating internal price discovery (that was a very astute observation and comment on your behalf, BTW - kudos!) is for you guys to start trading through the app a lot. Once we generate enough momentum and network effect, we'll let an internal price engine take precedence over external price feeds. After all the true price of something is what people are willing to pay for it, right?
As for government intervention, we'll cross that road when we come to it. We're a software company, not a financial concern. We don't use our balance sheets for anything transactional. Of course, we will not, in any way, fight the government or regulators. That is a fast track method of being put out of business. I think the best way to go about it is to educate the regulators and law makers as to the vast superiority of our system in comparison to the legacy system currently in use by the centralized banks and brokers, and to the fact that software developers are not, should not, be held to a similar standard as financial institutions.
The software is not open source, but we do have an API. Yes, there is a team of devs, software engineers, lawyers, and financial engineers and financial analysts that are continuously developing the product from all angles. Next up is the (regulated) issuance of crypto securities and the very innovative use of mobile tech.

Theta, time decay, and vega (volatility delta) will kill all but the best traders as you attempt to layer the options on top of each other to replicate these P2P OTC swaps. In addition, the less liquid options will eat you alive in spreads and slippage as you attempt to get in and out of them. 
Even if none of that hits you, the mere complexity of building a multi-leg, multi-asset option bundle, properly hedged, that can be rolled over time is not only time consuming and demanding of significant expertise, but awfully expensive once you factor in getting in and out at your desired price points.
The leveraged ETFs feature implied/inherent theta/vega issues, so if you are looking to hedge/speculate overtime, you can be correct from a speculative/directional basis yet still lose out, just like with options. 
@_date: 2015-03-04 17:21:33
I didn't infer it was a niche market, I inferred it was a niche market relative to financial instrument trading. In addition, you are playing word games. You know, and I know, that when you say payments, you mean remittances. You can politely say I need to get my head out of my ass if you wish, but math is math my friend and the article that is posted above clearly illustrated Bitcoin is capable of much more than currency trading. 
As for manipulating data... No, I'm just looking at the bigger numbers. Which number is bigger, $325B  or $1.653 quadrillion (notice this number doesn't include real estate, healthcare, IP, law, etc.)

You're welcome! I'm glad you see it my way. What makes it even more addicting (you have to play with it for a while before you realize it):
- It's the cheapest trading solution available on any platform for any asset - even forex
- It will trade anything (stock, bond, index, commodity, forex), almost any time, and do so with minutes - no account openings, registrations, verifications, etc. Download, fill with coin and go.
-you can trade 12 cents (profitably, net of fees) or 12 million dollars, it doesn't matter.
- you can leverage up to 10,000s, and do so with no margin calls or default risk. Everyone is guaranteed to get paid. 
As you may be able to tell, I'm excited. And it's totally software driven. No exposure to our balance sheet, we don't hold or control your assets, ever. You have no exposure to our financial condition. Truly P2P.

You're trying to get me to donate $20 to you, aren't you? :-) We're going to do $5, leveraged 65x ($325 of buying power) for 1 hour. I'll put the contract in to receive BTCUSD=x (bitcoin forex pair priced in US dollars) and pay GLD (SPDR Gold ETF). You match that order, taking the other side which will give you long GLD (gold) exposure and short BTC priced in USD. Contract is going up now.

That is under consideration. I want to see how it is accepted in the mainstream first, though.

These are fully funded trades (not fractionally reserved) that are derivative values of the underlying, funded by BTC.The trades are being made with values from the actual markets, but the system was designed - from the ground up - to circumvent the legacy exchange system stay are far away form SEC/CFTC problems as practically possible. 
Our servers do not (and never) hold any of your bitcoins or assets. It's either in your client side wallet or the blockchaing. If we get hacked, our servers confiscated by the government or a catastrophic event happens, all that is lost is our fees. As a matter of fact, in the event of catastrophic failure (earthquake takes out all of our servers on both coasts) you even get rollback instructions to have you capital returned to you (the trade won't finish, but you will be put back into your original capital position.

The reasoning for the closed source code is the nature of our true competitors. This product strikes straight to the heart of Wall Street's cash cow products and services, and open source code will allow them to put us out of business before we are able to gain traction and market share. As it stands now, the Wall Street banks will have to develop this from scratch, centralize it, and defeat (and/or avoid) IP protections.
Goldman Sachs, et. al. play by a different set of rules and in order to win the game we have to align ourselves accordingly. I am willing (with legal counsel's sign-off, if course) to have the code audited by a trusted, unconflicted, 3rd party such a one of the big 4 auditing firms if need be. 
In addition, we have made the flow of funds as transparent as possible. You can always track the bitcoin through the blockchain, always.

UltraCoin has the ability to give users of Bitcoin the ability to trade any arbitrary expression of value, including stocks, bonds, indices, commodities and currencies - both fiat and cryptocurrencies. It's very, very powerful!
The leverage allows users to dramatically turn up the price action that you would normally get if you traded in cash. If you are able to stomach the dramatic moves, we can essentially guarantee action almost immediately. Of course, this price action can just as easily go against as for you, so I strongly suggest you do your research and brush up on your cash management and risk management skills.
With UltraCoin you can literally trade with the big boys. You get virtually unlimited buying power, access to practically all developed markets, and the ability to dabble in any type of publicly traded asset that you desire. Now, it's you vs. Goldman Sachs. If you want some trading ideas, just reach out to me and I'll happy give you some illustrative setups (or look on our site, or in the tutorial).

I ask again, what bank, exchange or brokerage (of volume) open source their products to the end user? The top 5 bitcoin exchanges are all closed source. So is Citi, JPM, Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch.
@_date: 2015-03-04 16:38:19
I think you're missing the point. Bitcoin's being maligned in the media and corporate financial circles is due to the general public's (and many bitcoin aficionados as well) inability to grasp what this technology is capable of. Years after smart contracts have been introduced, all you really here in the media is Mt. Gox, price crashes, and Silk Road (all 1 yr+ old news) and fraud. 
Facts concerning the tech are either excluded or misrepresented. Such as the ECB's report knocking Bitcoin for not being able to refund a wrong payment. That's simply not true. They also failed to expound upon the features that better and threaten to replace the banks which the ECB supervises - again focusing on payment "schemes", altcoin scams, etc. This is the 2nd most powerful central bank in the world, not the opinion of a junior blogger posting out of his mom's basement.
I think it's time to focus the discussion on what bitcoin is capable of, and I mean capable of here and now - and not in a white paper or development project. If the ECB, BOE, etc. were more knowledgeable on this topic, the entire bitcoin community would be gaining considerably more traction. Just my humble opinion.

*Quick edit: I actually meant to respond to the comment regarding giving away ideas, below. Pardon the position of this comment.*
There are many ideas that I can execute that JPM couldn't and vice versa. Ideas that benefit from lightning quick execution will fail in JPM, while ideas that require substantial financial and political capital will fail with me at the helm but thrive at JPM. 
Then there's the not so obvious nuances. Ideas that benefit from margin compression of legacy biz models can intellectually be executed by both of us, but JPM will never touch it other than trying to drown it. I, on the other hand, will thrive in such an environment. Decentralized ideas: JPM=no, Me=yes. but understand why. JPM needs opacity to maintain pricing margin. While I need pricing margin as well, I would cost shift the business model and draw revenue from natural consumers/producer relationships that JPM couldn't thus driving their bread and butter down towards zerocost, benefiting greatly from the customer seeing everything while JPM suffers.

Please be aware that people use Wall Street products everyday, day in and day out, and have absolutely no idea how it works, or if it even works properly.

Similarly, firms with floating rate liabilities, such as loans linked to LIBOR, can enter into swaps where they pay fixed and receive floating SWAP CONTRACT DETAILS RECEIVE: FLOT - iShares Floating Rate Bond ETF (The index measures the performance of U.S. dollar-denominated, investment grade floating rate notes) PAY: VCSH - Vanguard Short-Term Corp Bd Idx ETF (This Index includes U.S. dollar-denominated, investment-grade, fixed-rate, taxable securities issued by industrial, utility, and financial companies, with maturities between 1 and 5 years)

Yes, think of how a central bank makes money by pinging a server. Well, now we do it for you benefit, but without the inflationary effects :-)

I don't know a lot about the Xapo situation (I'll have to read up on it), but it's a false assumption to assert that attempting to absorb all of your claims liabilities yourself is the same as self insurance. In the states (I presume in the UK as well), insurance is heavily regulated - and in the US is done so on the state level. NY and CT lead the charge here and you can't be considered insured from a regulatory perspective unless you pass certain reserve requirements which significantly alter the equation as compared to absorbing all of our claims losses in cash. Three quick examples to illustrate (in ascending order of regulatory approval and often efficiency):
a) You promise to pay all claims and losses, but those are just promises
b) You make the same promise, but you back that promise with a static pool of dead money as a reserve, that may or may not have been calculated by underwriting the risks involved.
c) You underwrite the risks put together monies and segregated accounts
d) You take C and cap our risks by buying stop loss insurance to limit your risk to X%
e) You take C and sell off a portion of the risk to a reinsurer, thereby (theoretically, depending or correlation/concentration risk and the true creditworthiness of you reinsurer) reducing the amounts you actually have to hold in reserves.
f) You create a captive insurer offshore in a domicile that has materially lower underwriting, reserve and capital requirements than someplace stateside like NY or CT, to cover your risks and call yourself insured by your captive. Keep in mind that your captive can easily employ stop loss, reinsurance, or can be writing policies on other risks for income and to diversify and alter its risk profile, or the captive can have other investors (in equity) as well. Now, many strong financial entities do this and are well protected, then again many are also shams that are dressed well too.
As you can see, there are too many variables to just say "since he's self-insured, he is absorbing the risk of loss himself". Self insurance should be the same as commercial insurance, economically and if set up correctly, sans the savings to the self insured of profit to the for-profit entity, and probably an increase in administrative costs due to lower economies of scale.

Thanks. We're trying very hard to make this happen.

Example 12: Changing exposure from one asset class (metal) to another (commodities) Commodity trading advisors (CTAs), or managed future funds can swap their exposure one class of assets to another (for example, they can swap metals for commodities) SWAP CONTRACT DETAILS RECEIVE: CRBQ (Global Commodity Equity ETF - that replicate the price and yield performance of the Thomson Reuters CRB Commodity Producers Index) PAY: XME (SPDR S&amp;P Metals &amp; Mining ETF - that provides investment results that, before fees and expenses, correspond generally to the total return performance of an index derived from the metals and mining segment of a U.S. total market composite index)

It means that you get the price action of the amount of leverage that you choose to dial in. If you opt for 10,000x leverage on X principal, each basis point of movement will gain/lose you $1000 (illustrative number). This movement is bounded by the amount of principal and collateral that you post. Of course, 10,000x leverage can blow you out almost immediately unless you post a large amount of collateral, so I would recommend beginners stat wtih 2x to 50x leverage on shorter term trades to get a feel for how the system works. Or, you can download our handy dandy trade designer spreadsheet to test different combinations to see how they would fare under various circumstances. You can get the spreadsheet model here -

Well, I'm sorry you don't like the site, but please don't let it's aesthetics (or lack thereof) interfere with the message. There's a lot of useful information on the blog (the most recent article detailing the levered forex trade to catch the euro/krone peg break), particularly on the macro and fundamental side.
If you are looking for more, or different information, simply ask me (us). That's what we're here for.
We use the smart contract feature of bitcoin via it's scripting language. If you want more specifics, I invite you to ask and I'll answer as much as I can or direct someone else to answer. Of course, there are certain trade secrets we shouldn't divulge, but I don't think we'll brush up against those very often, and if we do I assume you'll be understanding since we're running a business.

Our system is essentially pre-funded, so you don't get margin calls. What you will get is your collateral (essentially, "margin") eaten up very quickly if the trade goes against you, and if you posted no collateral you'd have the trade unwound automatically by the server. 
The lack of ability to go "negative" and the ability to have hard limits on your risk (and also potential reward) is what makes our system so unique.

Crypto 2.0 is not necessarily a token or a coin that can be purchased, but a method in which transactions interact with the blockchain. In my opinion, as of right now, the most capable (read as in fully operational and functional) Crypto 2.0 you can buy is bitcoin, particularly once adoption and network effects are taken into consideration. There are platforms with a wider set of functionality, but all in all, BTC has a lot to offer that many fail to realize. See  if your interested in a more verbose explanation of my viewpoint.

The next major release should be accompanied by an iPhone app. We are about 50% through our Android app (which is functional but not feature complete). 
As of now, the client is fully functional (although still in beta) on Mac, PC and most linux distros.

Forex is going to have a LOT of action in it this year. What you've seen in the EUR and the CHF is nothing compared to what's coming up because the countries that peg to the EUR can't afford to debase at the rate of the ECB. What does that mean? Well, for starters, there's a strong chance that BTC will spike relative to EUR and drop relative to the countries that can't afford the game. The problem is most brokerages are pulling leverage or pulling the pairs completely (calling them exotic and risky) because they don't want to get FXCM'd. That's  where UltraCoin comes in. Completely predictable due to hard limits set for P/L, always leverage available and you can trade anything you find an active ticker for we don't pull things out of the system).
Now, if forex gets volatile, so will rates, then equities. Theoretically, so should FI, but CBs are determined to keep those negative or at zero, or they feel they will all lose.
And then there's those banks....
