Ah, the classic neo-libertarian answer of "charity solves all". So, I assume your solution is private medical insurance. Can you tell me what the difference is between private insurance and national insurance? Rather than throwing insults and telling each other what we should be doing, I'm interested in having a discussion about what your opinion on potential solutions would be.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:31:44
Yeah, almost exclusively. SEPA transfers encourage this as well.

Thank you for the answer. I agree that conceding income is the right approach, not in the form of taxation but something similar. From my experience, hardcore capitalists (bordering on libertarianism) believe that charities are the solution instead of government forced taxes.
Personally, I think thats bull. 
That's asking someone who doesn't believe in the rules of capital (a charity) to look after someone who can't participate in the game. On top of that it's voluntary. I honestly think there's only a subset of humans in the world that have that much goodness in their heart. The rest of us are too busy trying to deal with our own shit to be able to help others. I mean that not as an insult, but as a reality check.
In agreement, I also believe in a UBI/standard income. The reason I believe this is because looking from the capitalist side of myself, I can see that the world will become more and more automated, with regards to labour, in the next 100 years. How do you solve the problem that a large number of people no longer have jobs without causing a civil war or mass genocide through hunger? UBI is a potential solution.

Isn't this a moot point as both Bitcoin &amp; BCash already have a large number of users? The reality is that BCash's major argument for superiority over Bitcoin is that they've solved the scaling issue. Despite having fewer active users, of course. Therefore the debate should be focused on what is the best way forward to scale up the network so that it can be ready for a larger number of users.


If that's true, how do you resolve this sentence: "Bitcoin has a 1MB block size". When something is forked, it no longer becomes the original, regardless of naming conventions. If I forked a popular SDK, not everyone who uses that SDK would receive those changes. Thus, my forked version of the SDK is suddenly something else. 
I appreciate your arguments but I believe they're a little flawed in regards to what points they raise.

I'm unsure of your argument as you're not providing any examples of failing healthcare systems in the world. I can point to some that are succeeding: 
Number three is Switzerland, arguably one of the most libertarian countries in the world. They have a mandated healthcare system similar to that of Obamacare. Trump's got it corrupt on this one, I'm afraid.
Maybe it wouldn't hurt to travel the world and see how things work elsewhere?

Whataboutism, not really an answer to the question I was asking.
I am genuinely interested to know. It's something that needs to be considered in society and as I am not a hardcore capitalist (or socialist), I have to ask the opinion of people who self claim to be.

As a hardcore capitalist, do you mind sharing your opinion on how people born with disabilities that leave them unable to work are able to earn and keep capital?
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:11:27
Didn't you just wish that on people who can't afford to pay medical bills?

Insider trading can be done regardless of whether or not it is illegal. Insider trading is trading based on insider knowledge of an act that will affect the price of something before the general public is made aware. There was definite insider trading in regards to Bcash and Coinbase as evidenced by the volume being bought in the run up to the release. It may not be illegal in the crypto world, but that it doesn't mean it doesn't exist anymore.

Who am I crucifying? You don't need to be so mad, friend. I apologise if highlighting a recent example of insider trading and my attempt to explain that insider trading and the legality of it are not mutually linked offended you. 
Irregardless, the market reacted to this case with nearly every coin taking a hit. This is why insider trading is an issue as it shakes the confidence of every investor for all coins. I hope Coinbase are taking it as serious as they say they are. Crypto still has a long way to go to be taken seriously and things like this stop that from happening.
Let's put the name calling and intelligence assessments to one side and perhaps talk about the good of all cryptocurrencies/tokens, rather than this tribal mindset of "my coin is better than yours".

Whataboutism has been around for a very long time. Please read up on it before casting stones. It literally is deflecting instead of providing support for disproving or proving an argument.
Again, you've answered about socialism, marxism and Communism, not the question I asked relating to capitalism. The only mention of capitalism is the last two out of the seven sentences. There is no debate here, the only answer I can take away from your response is there is nothing provisioned for the circumstance in which I offered except for pointing at the flaws of another ideology, and the possibility of someone else who refutes capital (i.e. a charity) taking care of it. Hardly reassuring that hardcore capitalism is the answer to my question.

The bank doesn’t pay. That’s a complete fallacy. Why would the bank pay for your transactions? Here’s a link that explains. Please google before you start peddling your narrative.

What about slippage? This smells like snake oil.

I'm very skeptical of the 80% accuracy figure.
When you say 80%, do you mean that the signal is correct 80% of the time or that you'd expect 80% ROI? If it's the former, what kind of trades do you miss in the 20%? Huge dumps would be a massive issue if they were missed or generated a false buy signal. 
What is the frequency of your signals? Are they intended for high frequency trading or low frequency spanning over days / weeks?
You say you're also using Machine Learning? What kind of Machine Learning are you using?
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:09:02
Yeah but it does though. You just don't see that added cost as it's hidden in the purchase price.

Visa &amp; MasterCard take a % of the transaction. That % is factored in when a company sets its prices. You pay fees, my friend. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:01:46
Almost, friend.
Card payments - You pay a fee.
Banking extras - You pay a fee.
Card takes a charge for more than in your account - You pay a fee.
Money transfer to anywhere not in the SEPA area - You pay a fee.
Have over £75k in your bank account and the bank goes bust? Tough luck champ, you losing everything above that number.
Whilst UK to UK and UK to SEPA transfers are great and feeless, they're not the most common transfers you make. The rest is card payments which you do pay a fee on, it's just hidden in the cost of the retail price.
