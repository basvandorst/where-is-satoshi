Don’t you have to hold when you can’t move it because the network won’t move and fees are so high?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:10:30
This guy gets it. Sent thousands yesterday with ltc for $0.03 and processed in under 10 minutes. Bitcoin has nothing but “store of value.” This bubble ripe for the popping Sunday. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:14:25
I sold everything yesterday and cashed out. Should be clear to my bank just before the bubble pops. No regrets. There will be blood next week. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:53:52
It was proposed because Blockstream will develop a fractional reserve system and steal from us. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:09:17
Wait till $B yes billions in leverage enters the game. She going straight under 10K causing a massive sell off. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:11:32
Disinterred party bruh. Many people gonna lose their life savings. Just warning. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:38:09
So, it’s like a bank? You give them digital gold and they give you fiat to spend. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:17:10
The banks can do better than 3 tx/s and $5 per transaction. My debit has 0 fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:13:14
That will be too late. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:19:11
Why would I share it? I’m going to hoard it in cold storage 
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:46:46
He was actually right when describing bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:25:46
Then my coinz will always be mine. HODL!
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:00:25
If your bitcoin are on exchanges they will be borrowed. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:48:54
This is a horrible solution. Give Blockstream your digital gold. They give you ious you can spend. Sound familiar? It should. It is traditional fractional reserve banking and a huge scam. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:15:30
Fuck the lightning network. Gold is a store of value for vaults!
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:52:30
They borrow them from the exchanges. If it is on an exchange you don’t own it. Same goes for stocks. The is basic basic stuff man. They borrow. Sell. Slam the price down. People sell into it. The price falls further. They buy back and cover. This is happens in regulated markets. They just can’t be super obvious about it. Imagine in an unregulated market. You all are gonna get fleeced so hard. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:07:31
Slightly revamped. Same concept. Gotta change the scam slightly. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:28:04
Wait till Wall Street can short it on Sunday ;) they are pumping it up this week and drawing people in. There will be suicidal people Monday morning. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:02:44
How am I wrong? Hint, I’m not. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:44:35
Wait till you see Wall Street leverage. The bitcoin market is tiny and Wall Street is salivating at shorting it to $0
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:55:39
That’s exactly what it is. Give Blockstream your digital gold. They give you spendable ious. Just like every paper fiat currency before them. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:03:32
Buy $10. Pay $5 in fee. Get $5 bitcoin :)
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:22:59
You just need to start the panic. You don’t need to finish it. Send it down 20% and watch people sell into the red candle. Furthermore with leverage, $50M becomes $5B. People will see it touch $7k and start selling into it. They can cover at 0
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:36:03
You don’t cash out. You hodl!
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:56:31
This is a ten dollar bill. Give block stream digital gold. They give you a paper iou. Sound familiar? Hope all the gold is there in 10 years. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:53:23
If it is on an exchange it can be borrowed. This applies to everything including run of the mill stocks held by your broker. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:10:48
You can’t have discussion about new concepts here?
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:59:53
Well all be too busy trying to figure out tabs. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:54:36
Wait till it crosses $6000. People have invested their life savings. They will sell sell sell. This Sunday is going to ruin many lives and pad many Wall Street Christmas bonuses. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:20:55
Isn’t it impossible to default on student loans? Seems different 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:32:29
Like gold, bitcoins will be secure.....until they aren’t. Would you trust an organization that intentionally sabotaged bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:01:21
Until a few stop holding and cash out. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:22:38
It’s different. It’s on the news everyday and the average person is hyped and buying. People clearly learn nothing from history. When the shoe shine boy is giving you stock advice it’s time to sell. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:19:36
How many transactions per second again? Oh right. Lightning will fix this 18 months ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:36:14
Lololololololololololol. Wait. Bitconnect 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:18:53
Ask yourself. Will Blockstream profit?
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:22:58
If you aren’t cashed out you aren’t retired. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:47:34
 Aha hahahaha. There it is. Failed as a currency. Please hold people while we unload our coins. Bag holders HODL!
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:52:50
It is illiquid. It is stored in Blockstream vaults. They give you digital ious to spend. Sound familiar? It should it’s the backbone of the current banking system. Give the bank gold. They give you spendable gold certificates. Problem is in 40 years there won’t be any gold. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:51:37
You give Blockstream digital gold. They secure it and give you paper ious you can spend. Trust them. They won’t use a fractional reserve system like every bank in the history of the earth before them. How do people not see this scam for what it is?!? Digital fiat. Give them bitcoin. They give you a digital easily spendable token. Hey intentionally crippled bitcoin to launch this scam. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:59:18
Hijacking top comment. The lightning network is a scam. They want to secure your digital gold for you. The Blockstream gives you easily spendable ious. Sound familiar? It should. It’s the traditional banking system. Hope Blockstream doesn’t use a fractional reserve system. They crippled bitcoin intentionally to launch this scam. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:47:52
It’s bitcoin fiat. Give block stream your digital gold. They give you spendable ious. You spend them. Sound familiar?!?!? This is a digital version of fiat currency. They purposely crippled bitcoin so they can profit from this scam. It’s time to abandon core. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:31:33
You aren’t. If regulators shut down the exchanges and all the transfers from usd euros and yen to bitcoin the market is dead. Soon bitcoin will be using more electricity than japan. Bitcoin is going to 0
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:44:16
Bitfinex operates in fractional reserves and margin. Same thing and they carry all the volume. Margin is loaning. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:16:36
Ethereum is the reserve currency. Bitcoin is the legacy currency that couldn’t adapt fast enough and died. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:54:56
This gift card is nothing short of trading digital gold for digital fiat and hoping Blockstream will hold the gold securely. They intentionally crippled bitcoin to push this abortion on to us. Say no to digital fiat.

They are completely relevant. For example, Joseph smith was a con artist his whole life then went on to start Mormonism. His previous life as a convicted con artist completely shreds his credibility going forward and anyone who thinks he is credible is a moron errr Mormon.

I already told you. I’ve invested in a bubble before. I lost nothing because I was in at lower than post bubble prices but I remember the euphoria. The memes. I’ve seen it all. This is exactly the same. Only difference is bitcoin has no utility and a lot of infighting. I’m so stoked to be on the sidelines for this bubble. I WANT to be on the sidelines. I know where this is headed. Popcorn land and I will be laughing my ass off reading this posts as it plummets back to $10 when people finally rush for the exists and there are no buyers to be found. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:50:02
Iota can. Easily. No fighting to get it done either.

About that transaction speed though.....

I meant if an American used our Canadian healthcare. It would be far more affordable even paying cash. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:06:00
When it is running it won’t be centralized. Hasn’t been around long. How long has bitcoin classic been trying to solve the problem?
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:41:16
Lolol Americans coming to Canada for affordable healthcare. For real. I hear if you pay cash it isn’t that expensive. They would charge you what ohip would pay so like $30 to see a family doctor for 10 minutes or $300 for an ER visit. :)
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:52:54
Gotta love that bitcoin privacy.

Those companies had real value. They weren’t a collection of electricity turned into heat. This is worse. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:34:37
That’s called fear of missing out. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:08:32
Because it’s pumping the price up. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:48:27
Lol I used bitcoin once to buy another crypto. Bitcoin had its time but the slow ass blockchain will be its own undoing. Visa processes 24,000 tx per second and bitcoin wants to be taken seriously at 5. Word of advice. Get out while you can. Trying to beat a bubble never ends well. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:55:59
Could’ve bought at sub 5000. I’ve seen this before. I know where this is headed. You can’t time a bubble. Once it pops it’s over. I want no part of this. I will happily watch from the sidelines. If this was Tesla or amazon or spacex or google like company with great tech I’d be all over it. This is a worthless crypto currency with slow transaction times, high fees and surrounded by con artists. I’m happy to be not involved at all. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:47:30
It’s a tangle. It is the future. Blockchain is absurd and power hungry. A simple solution for a small scale operation but it will never be a viable currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:29:51
Unconfirmed still rising
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:02:32
Except you need 2fa to withdraw plus email verification. On binance anyway you do. Also 2fa to do pretty much anything but trade and having the snapshot doesn’t help at all. It’s very secure. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:13:17
Still haven’t addressed my points. Let me guess. “Read the white paper” bitcoin classic isn’t true to the white paper.   
Also “Contrarianism in Science Edit. In science, the term "contrarian" is often applied to those who reject a general scientific consensus on some particular issue, as well as to scientists who pursue research strategies which are rejected by most researchers in the field.” Lolol I lolol i am in the majority. You are the contrarian for trying to get rich off of what most economists think is absurd. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:37:29
Amazon offers a service. Bitcoin offers 5 transactions per second. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:57:18
It creates a bitcoin classic and bitcoin wallet by default. Where is the scam?
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:22:59
What is bitcoin classics transaction speed? Why is visa transaction speed? Mastercard? Do you see the problem? This is basic stuff. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:43:40
Lmao! Pump pump pump!
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:56:58
Are the millions economists or have even a slight grasp of economics?
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:19:04
With the increase in difficulty, will bch or btc be more profitable to mine? Difficulty increase with respect to themselves don’t mean anything. Which one will be more profitable?
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:14:41

Buttcoin is the only one I seriously post on lol. The rest are for the trolls.

How are you going to use it for transactions like coffee and gas when it is limited to 432000 transactions per day?
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:45:03
It creates both a bitcoin classic and a bitcoin wallet by default.....
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:46:26
This is the driving force of bubbles. Fear of missing out. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:44:35
I still can’t tell the difference between bitcoin classic and bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:40:23
How is it any different. As someone who was invested in another bubble I can tell you I’m salivating at being on the sidelines for this one and getting to watch it implode on itself. I am going to enjoy this so much. I literally can’t wait. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:04:08
No it won’t. I can send money to my friends for free and instantly with current banking protocol. The money is also worth the same amount before during and after its sent. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:39:33
 I did my research. This is a Ponzi scheme from Vietnam. Because it is bitcoin your money is gone forever with no recourse when they take the money and run
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:58:20
Big money behind bitcoin is pumping the price up. They use troll farms in Russia to shout “hodl!” So nobody sells. When they exit and stop pumping, the holders will be left holding the bag as it were. Don’t you think it’s suspicious so many people use the same narrative? I’ve seen all this before in the silver market. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:31:39
We are talking about visas 24000 to per second and a valuable Amazon not gold
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:15:30
Word of advice. Leave this echo chamber once in awhile. I’m going to bed.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:08:39
I know all I need to know. Limited supply, high transaction fees, slow network, infighting, extremely volatile. Bitcoin will never be a currency. It won’t be a store of value either since it’s intrinsically super fiat. So besides it’s meteoric rise(likely a bubble) why should I put my money on the line? My opinion won’t change about bitcoin classic. Ethereum and Monero actually have some utility. Bitcoin is moving on speculation and tether pumping. If you actually did some research you would know this. I can think objectively because my money isn’t on the line and I’m not “about to be rich.”

It’s been 7 years. That ship has sailed. If they aren’t already using it, they never will. What’s to stop visa or a big bank from straight up copying the source code, fixing it to meet their needs and releasing their own currency? They have the customers and would have over night adoption. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:10:33
You be the bag holder when the bubble pops. How can everyone here be so naive to not realize they are being manipulated by troll farms?
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:30:20
Fear of missing out is the last part of the euphoria stage in bubbles. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:33:11
I’m going to give you something I never got. When in forums for items like bitcoin, gold etc it is always “us vs the big guy.” Every dip is a buying opportunity. Don’t sell ever. Buy and hold. There is always “resistance” until it easily passes through. Then it’s a “buying opportunity.” There will be lots of talk of “to the moon” and “retirements”  the reality is you are watching some small fish. I’m talking sub $10k invested. A few hundred of these people have no effect on the overall market and know just as little as you. You are watching cheerleaders. Do not follow their lead. You will find yourself getting excited and not wanting to miss out. You will buy more. Most people lose. You are up against bankrolls of hundreds of millions of dollars. You “hodling” has no affect on the price. You are along for the ride and nobody here knows where this ride is going. You must do your own due diligence and not rely on anybody here. You will find that it needs to be hobby to do enough due diligence otherwise the time spent simply isn’t worth it.   
.  
Disclaimer. I own precisely 0 bitcoin. I have owned it twice only so I could buy iota and from what I’ve seen here these last few days I will never purchase it again. I will use ethereum as a go between fiat and iota. I 100% think bitcoin is done for. It’s users won’t let it scale up and it has a poor transaction speed. I think that after this weekend you will find a lot of frustration from people as they move on to currencies not plagued with these systematic issues. I’m just here eating popcorn. It’s nice to watch from the outside with no dog in the fight for once rather than getting all riled up in the emotions. If you are an investor sometimes it helps to watch a forum of something you have no vested interest in to get a hold on the way people act when the price is volatile.   
.  
Also never invest money you aren’t comfortable losing. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:47:07
It’s deflationary by nature and if you knew anything about economics that is horrible. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:46:50
One of these days the bottom is gonna fall out from all the worthless tether pumping. It will fall 80% in a day. The big players will have taken their money out and let it do its own thing and find its true value. I’ll be right here. Popcorn in hand. Giggling like a little girl.
