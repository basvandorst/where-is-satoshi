Great Find.
Novogratz seems really inspired. I would put him on the same level as Patrick Byrne.

Before you pass judgement this is an interesting experiment.
I think it important to note that 1. Many families already have next to nothing. 2. There are quite a few families that give up material things to live a more minimalist lifestyle.  This family is not only doing that, but they are invested in what could be a potential technological revolution in the meantime.
Scenario one: They lose a lot of their investment in bitcoin and learn how to grow closer together as a family while learning how unimportant material wealth is. 
Scenario two: They still learn how unimportant material wealth is and grow together as a family; but know best how to utilize their new prosperity because they have spent so much time without it and know what is important in life.
Hopefully they can help change the world for good either way.

If you're looking to use crypto in day to day transactions, Litecoin is probably your best bet right now.

Just before the recent jump, I could have included that, but it wouldn't have fit my agenda.

This is incredible.
We should save this as a meme for the 10k+ USD/BTC exchange rate.

BTC has been and may continue to be attacked by those with ill intent, but the original blockchain will come back stronger every time. 
Bitcoin is built on true principles of mathematics and everyone in the system relies on one another to maintain true stability. Attacks like this go against everything that Bitcoin stands for.
I will not support B2X.

Exactly.
