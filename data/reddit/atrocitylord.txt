I own some xlm.

Is that a sarcastic question, or are you genuinely curious as to where you purchase xlm? All of these down votes are making me weary, but it's probably the fact that we're talking about alt coins on a bitcoin sub. Regardless, I bought them on Binance.

I’m afraid not. I work with western union and the sheer amount of old people that I push through every day will keep them in business. Don’t get me wrong, I want them out too. It would make my job easier without them.

For sure. The route things are going in general, even with bitcoin, points to a system operating on a whole different means. It is proven that given our current technology it is possible for instantaneous transfers with zero fees, and it would be dumb to not take advantage of it. I quite like the byzantine system XLM operates on based on what *I do* understand of it, which I admit is very much surface level knowledge. My first comment was more of an opinion based on personal experience which really doesn't hold any grounds on a larger scale. It's more frustrating seeing these people waste so much money through WU. I even try to convince them to switch to other systems of money transfer like cryptocurrencies or even paypal. I don't know if you've spent much time talking to the general older community, but anything with a computer involved terrifies them.  I know paypal will vanish too, but it's still a hell of lot better on peoples wallets than WU.
