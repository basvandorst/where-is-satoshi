I cashed out some Btc - getting my initial investment back - into 1/10 Britannias - UK legal tender gold thus tax free. A couple of weeks after thinking I had explained this to a colleague, having shown her said Britannias, she asked whether I still had my shiny bitcoins!

"few short months"
BTC is at 250M unconfirmed and adoption has started. What will it be in a few short months?
And would LN now solve the current issue? How many of those 250M would not be there if we had LN now?

Cannot say how much I appreciate this kind of thing. It would seem that Bitcoiners have a different approach to wealth than 'old' money has.
I have applied on behalf of my local UK charity and hope you look favourably upon us over here.

Not used it


It is a software wallet

Upvote if you want to see CNBC do a story on how *two felons* [sic] were instrumental in developing Bitcoin up until September this year and continue to be heavily involved in the crypto universe.
Alternatively: grow up and accentuate the positive of your own crypto of choice rather than behaving like a child towards those you do not support.

coinbase is ok for small amounts without full verification
localbitcoins has worked for me as well. ** always be wary of url's scammers are hard at work. 
you can get a software wallet [PC or phone]. I have several. Exodus is simple to use.
I do not keep anything on exchanges or online wallets.
A hardware wallet costs a bit - you will decide when you have enough crypto to want it air-gapped from teh internet.

Great time to buy more bitcoin - I just did

Bitcoin is not a hedge. My first profit taking from Bitcoin was to purchase gold as a hedge.
Hedge built - HODL engaged

Ifs buts and maybes do not make you financially secure. Being mortgage free with the option of continuing to invest for your future gives you the security you came here for.

It will increase bigly. It has an amazing team behind it - amazing.  Remember how bad it was doing when Obama was in charge of Bitcoin!

Exodus is also a good software wallet.
Later you may want to consider a hardware wallet.
Look them both up and understand them.
Rule  Never give your private keys to anyone.
Rule  Be aware the internet is full of scammers trying to get you to click links / posting disguised/false addresses, etc.
Rule  The Crypto keys on your devices are only as safe as you are capable of making them. With Bitcoin going through the roof there is much incentive for people to hunt them down with viruses, etc.

I would suggest that anyone who states that average intelligence does not exist is possibly a moron.

$100 invested in mid September would be worth $250 today.

There are two kinds of people.
  Those that don't grok Bitcoin.
    And those that HODL.

I am old enough to have used Video 2000. 
Not heard of it? Well it was better than Betamax, which was better than VHS. We were slagging each other's choices off back then.
The words do nothing but perpetuate your own chosen self delusion. All that matters in the end is whether your self delusion matches the consensus.
If it does not then you end up with a piece of shit tech that is incompatible with the wider world. 
If it does then grand vistas open up to you and you reap all the rewards of a lucky guess - because you really have no control over what the consensus delusion will ultimately be - because the consensus delusion need not be based on facts.

Do not expect a polite response from the herd in here.
Forget mining - no longer profitable unless you have $000's to invest in equipment.
Get yourself a wallet - Exodus is a good starter. But look into security and understand it. Rule  Never ever give anyone your private key unless you trust them not to take your money (i.e. tell no-one but let your next of kin know how to obtain that key in the event of...)
Find an exchange - Coinbase, GDAX - look them up and find one you are comfortable with.
Then regularly buy a little. Never invest what you cannot afford to lose.
And HODL - do not trade, do not try to sell high and buy low. Every trade will eat your money.
You are 18 - you have a long life in which to earn money. Buy a little every month and HODL and in five years you might well be financially independent - if all goes pear shaped you will have had a fun ride and because you never invested more than you could afford to lose you will still be smiling.

Please do cash in. There's only 21 Mil to go around and I would prefer they are with people who truly grok the tech.

You're 17 and living at home. Invest EVERYTHING!
...and HODL

I like Andreas' analogy.
Blockchain is a disruptive technology akin to the internet.
Bitcoin is Blockchain's email - the catalyst that ignites Blockchain.

Someone will be asking you that three years from now - and it will still not be too late then.

'normal' people are too busy watching reality tv and slugging on a six-pack.
'normal' people have no concept of financial cycles or the ponzi scheme that is fiat money.
'normal' people will always be needed to sweep the streets clear of gravel that can damage a Lambo'.

We humans tend to live in the moment. Bitcoin is not for the moment.
I am thinking about 2022 - five years from now. I am making my investment choices based on that and not on some transitory short term price fluctuations.

Try to apply some objectivity rather than 'look at what it's doing' or 'look at what it did in the past'.
Where has bitcoin been mined and by whom? China. China is now regulating and miners are shutting up shop. If 80% of the market collapses then you can ponder where that will put the price and how long, if ever, it will take to claw back that price correction.
If you have hard earned cash that you do not mind losing but think bitcoin is a better bet than the horses or the lottery then you should buy when you think it is near the bottom.
If you have bitcoin but are broke then you should cash in.
If you have bitcoin, are not broke, but do not want to invest more, then switch off the news and come back in a year to see where the price went.
