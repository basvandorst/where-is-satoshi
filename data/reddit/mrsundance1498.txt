It has a an over inflated dollar value that rapidly declining. Bitcoin itself has no inherent value. 
@_date: 2014-04-16 16:03:57
Yes avoiding social responsibility is funny... 
@_date: 2014-05-02 12:21:57
This all could have been avoided by better planning. 
@_date: 2014-11-20 21:27:19
It currently has a dollar value. They are stealing it to cash it out not to hodl. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 02:29:37
I can see the value in that. Now i am no sociologist but wouldt we see the same type of behavior as with reddit where patently false advice can be self reinforced by a small amount of positive karma/tipping early on? 
@_date: 2015-01-15 05:42:00
Really, log charts isnt this a troupe by now...
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:49:30
Ive said this before but its worth saying again this looks like a transparent pump attempt. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 00:19:58
Didnt you just say yesterday that the price will continue rising for a few days? Tell me again how useful ~~Astrology~~ TA is.
@_date: 2015-01-13 06:07:08
Explain to me the difference between a "strong hand" and a "Zealot"
@_date: 2015-01-28 20:58:36
The VC was not earmarked for crypto and for that matter they said they would give back to the community that doesn't mean 50 million dollars. Reddit has hired a whole bunch of new people just last  2 weeks. Guess how many where "cyptocurrency engineers" 
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:36:37
What tactics specifically do you take issue with? 
@_date: 2014-10-15 10:19:46
I though most of that kind of thing was run on Linux. The more you know.
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:38:34
How many times has that been said. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 01:54:15
They already tried bitcoin black Friday, on black Friday no less. It was a failure.  
@_date: 2015-01-15 01:01:24
This is good for gentlemencoin?
@_date: 2015-01-27 18:39:43
Well its a mockup not "real" if get what i mean.  
@_date: 2015-01-15 05:45:41
Hey these are libertarians your dealing with they wont do shit for free. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 01:31:00
I hope you paid in Fiat for the artists sake! but they look very well done.
@_date: 2015-01-24 03:27:55
Buttcoin is a silly sub making fun of the over the top bitcoin supporters in a very silly way. Sometimes we have serious articles but most of the time its just taking the piss. This is what people who have a different view to you often do.  
@_date: 2015-01-30 23:02:08
Yes because deflation is bad. I could invest in a new company or i could sit on my money and have a better return in bitcoin land. Small amounts of inflation is good for a free market economy.    
@_date: 2015-01-19 12:31:37
Well is this article wrong? Bitcoin can absolutely help terrorists. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 06:19:35
Yes that's true these days but not always
@_date: 2015-01-30 22:36:18
Microsoft and overstock do not keep bitcoins. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:54:35


and you guys wonder why there are not more female bitcoiners. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 02:21:36
Well i mean we are having this conversation right now, which i class as a good thing. We are having a meaningful discussion right now and there is no tipping involved. My concern is that this sort of discussion will disappear in a world where tipping is at the forefront of everyone's mind.  
@_date: 2015-01-03 13:26:06
Yeah you are right i guess i misspoke. I should have said it did not have the intimidate impact that many in the Bitcoin community were predicting. 
But i think my point about the killer app being just around the corner as a proverbial carrot still stands. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 13:50:19
I have no sarcasm meter but isnt that exactly what bitcoin speculators are doing? 
@_date: 2015-01-24 03:05:35
Reddit works because the points are imaginary. There would be real life actual shills if people could make a living off it. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 02:25:35
Yup and proud of it i thought bitcoin was part of the free market of ideas. You will also notice i said i wasn't a bitcoiner in my post title. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 13:38:51
Not a cult. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 04:44:21
Yup that to ensure they have enough evidence for a conviction. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 02:33:18
Well if that all it is then its still wierd. dialogue will be inhibited by people conforming to the ideas that get the most tips.   
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:31:32
Bitcoin is like gambling! that a family friendly message
@_date: 2015-01-24 04:03:16
Hey thanks for being cordial i will try to reciprocate from now on. I would just like to point out that only has 4000 subs so compare that to subs and i think you will see that brigading isn't really as big an issue as you may think.  
@_date: 2015-01-24 03:53:30
Rude yes very much so, aggressive i disagree. Im not trying to score points here i am trying to understand why people think that money should be exchanged for social interaction. yes i dont think it should but i am allowed that opinion just as i am allowed to express my opinion here as per the site rules. I see no aggression here.   
@_date: 2015-01-24 02:17:26
Okay think of it this way say i was talking to you in your office and i had come up with some advice about how to to X the Y and you handed me 35 cents. this says to me that i am not valued as an advisor but rather as a tool 
@_date: 2015-01-22 15:24:15
"Do you know bitcoin?" doesn't make a lot of sense maybe change it to "do you know about bitcoin?" 
@_date: 2015-01-04 12:19:14
I wish you good luck but with the hate of ALtcoins around here i dont think this is going to go over well. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 11:43:49
Can someone explain to me the difference between TA and astrology? 
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:17:29
Bitcoin will never be under 1000 again!
@_date: 2015-01-19 12:26:18
Well from my experience that's not true as my landlord has a different bank. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 15:46:39
lol "Fortune 500"... @_date: 2015-01-13 04:49:15
I imagine this is due to the fact that anyone who brings up the price gets reamed out by this community 
@_date: 2015-01-17 12:27:45
Yes lets all protect a person who ordered hits on the roommates of primary targets NAP be damned  
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:51:11
A fair and balanced take on the issue /s
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:26:45
Sorry but i dont feel sorry for you. you bought in to the libertarian dream and now its coming true in a microcosm  
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:21:37
Don't worry i am sure a new bot will prop up the price shortly. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 05:46:24
BTC is all speculation it has no real value to match its market cap so after mainstream interest fades so will the price as it is eaten by miners selling to cover costs. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 20:06:51
You can check out the stats [here] ( . 
@_date: 2015-01-24 05:39:09
I guess what i meant was the whole this is fake as harry potter and people lapped it up for days. Imagine what you could do with that kind of influence.  
@_date: 2015-01-19 12:07:15
I pay rent directly to my landlord from my account and it is transferred instantly. Also if i need to pay money to my parents that is transferred instantly as well. .  
@_date: 2015-01-15 00:34:15
I dont get it. Now i am no expert but its my understanding that there would be no need for an exchange without fiat as people could just conduct business directly with each other. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 13:47:31
I love how its priced in Fiat. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 20:44:52
There is none because is an idiot who based the whole idea on something that doesn't exist yet.

Yes anytime before last year bitcoin hit the mainstream and failed to get traction its over. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 17:27:49
Its probably more to do with ISIS attempting to make its own currency based of gold and the bitcoin/gold comparison is pretty obvious

@_date: 2015-01-24 02:40:20
Thats a very good use for change tip that i had not thought of. The problem is in order for them to use it they would have to convert to fiat so it may be no more effective than regular donations.

He was literally caught with the admin screen open. i dont understand how you lot can get past this and think hes innocent in a court of law.  
@_date: 2015-01-24 02:48:00
Its exactly the same and this is the problem just look at the TIFU post that all over reddit the last couple days/ 
@_date: 2015-01-24 02:08:11
The owners are making money from selling that info and ads. Frankly id rather have a dialogue than a point scoring competition which is basically what changetip is (in my opinion).  
@_date: 2015-01-15 01:12:40
More likely a death rattle. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 19:53:02
I dont really know what savings maccas could make with bitcoin i doubt they suffer from many charge backs. Also lets not lose lose sight of the fact that bitcoin transactions are not free they are just currently subsidized at the moment its costs 9.48 USD per transaction

Mainstream is a bit of a stretch. The greens got less than 2% of the vote in that electorate last election. 
EDIT: i also find it strange that a green party politician would support bitcoin considering how energy intensive it is. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:35:26
Well it certainly can be taken away from you otherwise there wouldn't be LEO related bitcoin auctions
@_date: 2015-01-13 05:40:57
I love this sentiment just sit on it and do nothing and you will be rich never mind the massive flaws in a deflationary system.

Hey the free market has decided i thought you lot loved the free market. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 02:04:41
Hey thanks for the tip but i wont be collecting it. My main issue with this is that its pretty dehumanizing for example if i said to you "your contribution to the conversation is worth 35 cents" that make me think that the conversation is about scoring points rather than dialogue.   
@_date: 2015-01-22 17:16:33
Hes specifically said that bitcoin is a stepping stone not the end product so i think this headline is misleading. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 14:54:01
Frankly the free market has spoken and apparently free market solutions are not viable. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:59:15
Yeah you are defiantly right that in an ideal world bitcoins cannot be seized. However under threat they can i mean realistically a person could break into your house and demand your private keys at gunpoint. In 99% of cases people would give it up, so saying they cant be taken is a stretch.   
@_date: 2015-01-13 05:57:00
Well thats not technically true as gold was the first. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:09:45
I love this statement because it can retroactively applied to dark horse successes but nobody ever makes mention of all the failures where if you bought when there was blood in the street you would have lost everything.  
@_date: 2015-01-17 09:40:48
Oh come on we all know how many times this has been said in the last 12 months. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 12:35:27

The long term deflationary nature of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 19:36:47
Why would Mcdonalds go through the expense of setting up the necessarily massive infrastructure for a currency that it has a larger market cap than? 
@_date: 2015-01-17 07:06:58
I swear to god if any of you think this has to do with bitcoin you are deluded. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:37:27
The thing about the long term perspective is what utility is offered by bitcion in the mid to long term. The current price is based on speculation remittances is the only legal avenue for bitcoin utility so no wondwer the price is tanking.    
@_date: 2015-01-24 02:35:10
Or it can lead to people only posting things that receive tips allowing those with the money to control the conversation. does that remind you of anything? 
@_date: 2015-01-19 12:28:36
This will surly make bitcoin look legitimate.

Well firstly the would have to compete with existing systems that dont require internet access.  
@_date: 2015-01-24 05:10:53
Thats very true my issue is people getting a financial reward for that score as that will motivate people far more than imaginary points.

Why would you want a deflationary economy? I mean why would i buy something today if my money was worth more tomorrow?  
@_date: 2015-01-04 12:09:14
I think the main issue is there is no real reason for joe who lives down the street to use Bitcoin. This coupled with the need for new money be constantly coming in to offset the selling by miners.   
@_date: 2015-01-04 13:46:22

Yeah i dislike bitcoin Ive made no secret of that. However what you are saying has been said at every supposed bottom

Thank you for the tip but i wont be collecting it. Ive said the same thing above but ill just repeat myself here.

@_date: 2015-01-03 13:11:58
The thing is Bitcoin has had 6 years to come up with the "Killer App". For years now people have been saying its right around the corner. Take circle for example that was supposed to be the "Killer App" but nothing came from it. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 01:50:59
Yeah this seems like nothing more than a transparent pump attempt. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 04:42:29
I hardly think crypto enthusiasts are in a position to argue.

No just that there are more easily accessible services that are more well established.

Eh Bitcoin and block chain are different things look at IBM for example.

Okay so lets just get this straight you lied about your charity work and then post a video not an academic journal not a conference but a a single video (that has next to nothing to do with bitcoin unless your stupid enough to thinks its a new industrial revolution) and you expect me to take you seriously...  
@_date: 2015-02-01 04:44:16
Well no maybe OP is arguing about the long term future of bitcoin. All i was saying is that you were completely wrong. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 04:30:41
Well its inflationary at the moment... Its only deflationary in the long term.

A country is a Sovereign entity. Basically what that means is that a sovereign country has the power to enforce their own laws without interference from another entity. The Isle of Man Is currently not part of the UK this is true instead they are under the control of the Queen and so are not sovereign and thus not a country.

This is silly for a number of reasons but the one that sticks out in my mind is that community gardens already exist and are quite popular. How does adding robots and bitcoin make this solution more competitive than an already established free system?
