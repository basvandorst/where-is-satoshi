Wrong path I think.
They are a list of dates. 
Each entry is a one to two digit number, follow by a four digit year, two digit month, two digit day. The initial numbers seem to be the letters we're looking for, and the dates are likely a reference to a source material. I can't figure out what the source material is.
@_date: 2018-08-22 17:45:27


It might be me, it might be you. Let's take a look.


Zero citations, and only vaguely references instances of people being mean. You're starting to look pretty stupid.


"Sued Grenade in 2015, claiming the company used the cat’s image on several of its products, despite only having the rights to sell a line of iced coffees called “Grumpy Cat Grumppuccino.”"
A person with a licensing agreement for a name goes too far and uses the image as well as the name, and the person that did the licensing sues for damages due to lost income. The case is mounting that you are pretty stupid.


"alleging that Warner Bros. and 5th Cell, the developer and maker of Scribblenauts, respectively, used images of Keyboard Cat and Nyan Cat without permission or compensation"
This case doesn't involve a contract, but specifically deals with copyrighted materials being used for profit by an organization. The evidence that you are dumb is very compelling at this point.


Yet again, a third case of images being used for gain.
So here's the thing I'm starting to realize that maybe your more ignorant than stupid. Likely a result of being about 14 years old.
There is no one on the face of the planet who has ever, or will ever be successfully sued over re-posting a meme. What you are confusing here is the use of copyrighted material, and the gain by another party that illegally used that material.
The vast majority of cases do not meet this criteria in online forums and websites due to something called "Fair Use". I recommend you look that up. (That can be the thing you learn today. You should always try to learn something new every day). Fair Use is a relatively complex legal doctrine, but it basically boils down to people being able to use materials that are not theirs for the purpose of commentary or comedy, or a few other things.
If I had taken that image, and posted it to my website, and charged people money . . . say to buy a T-Shirt with that image on it, or a subscription fee to view my awesome image, but that image in fact belonged to someone else, that would be a chance for them to attempt to seek damages for copyright infringement. That of course too depends on if the material had been a copyright in the first place, though again, this is more complex than it seems.
Regardless, the re-posting of memes on Reddit, for nothing more than Karma, is 100% legal, and only an idiot or an ignoramus would think otherwise. I recommend you remove your head from you ass, and enjoy some fresh air. It has to be pretty stuffy in there.

I want to use it as a currency. I don't want it as a get rich quick scheme. I am relatively bored by the volatility of late, probably because I am new. This boredom will likely be welcome after a couple more years into my usage. 
Boredom probably stems from my incessant drive to constantly check pricing on funds that I used to invest in for my 401K. Now that I ignore that, I've moved my bad habit somewhere else.

Maybe at MIT itself awareness is not an issue, and in many places awareness isn't an issue, but doesn't the presence of an ad campaign itself add a sense of validity and curiosity to something, especially if done correctly (Not going to try to define that at this moment), and in an area that would be prone to adoption (BU, Harvard, MIT, Northeastern, Fenway Park, etc.). 
Lots of exposure in an area that has almost no bitcoin adoption currently on the marketplace side. 
Might not be the best idea in the world, but I think it's better than the almost zero ideas that have been proposed here in the last several months. 
I'd like to also confirm that I am not a Roger Sock Puppet, since my user name doesn't make that explicitly clear.

This is just a guess, but if you divide the number of sets of dates with the number of seed words (67/12) you get 5.58. The number of letters in seed words is something like 4-8 letters per word. I get the feeling this is going to be easier than we think and that it will be simple substitution where we find the source material, we go to something like "The 5th letter on the date mentioned" and that will be the letter for substitution. Once we go through all 67, I think it is just going to spell out in order the 12 words. 
Just a hunch, but I can't imagine, without a lot more hints, that is going to be much more difficult than that. Something a non-mathematician can figure out, but you'd need to be clever.

I don't have any proof for you because I'm not an LN expert.
That being said, going onto Reddit and saying "I'm skeptical something works. I need evidence. If the random people I'm babbling at are willing to provide me evidence that counters my skepticism, I'll stop being skeptical!" is not a great approach.
Might I make a recommendation. Do your own research. Google is your friend.
With your current method and mindset, you are likely to reject any evidence presented to you by others, since you are skeptical, which comes with a bias, unconscious or otherwise. If you do your own research, you'll be better positioned to not let your bias affect the evidence you find. Just be careful to make sure you review evidence from reliable sources.

No, it cost SpaceX a lot of money, but anyone with any understanding of that event knows that SpaceX was launching a test rocket, which needed a dummy payload. Standard in the industry. 
Instead of sending a block of cement, which is pretty standard, they sent Elon's car because they knew it would generate excitement about SpaceX and their new rocket, create a cool image of space for a younger generation, and yes, feature a 10 year old Tesla vehicle. 
So if you want to put down the cost of the car. . . around 100K. . . then sure, feel free to chalk that up as their marketing budget for the last decade. . . That isn't standard marketing though, and most reasonable people wouldn't include it.
