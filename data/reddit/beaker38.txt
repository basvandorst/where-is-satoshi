do some google on it.  There's a quick help page by intuit (TurboTax) and also a rather easy to read release by the IRS about it.  Looking at your last paragraph: Yes, talk to a tax professional.  And when you say "structure your deposits," I really hope you mean "time your sales." You realize the income at the time of the sale, not when it goes into your bank account.  Doing a sale of a large amount, and then piecemealing it into individual small deposits to hide it from the IRS constitutes "structuring" subject to large fines and prison time.

That test - your scenarios are mutually exclusive.
The equivalent of putting bitcoin under you mattress is a private wallet.  There is no central bank or government to take 1-2%.
If you put assets into an account (fiat money, bitcoin, stocks, anything you don't physically or completely control) they are subject to partial (interest) or complete seizure.
Your Scenario 2 makes no sense.  It's not part of any reality.  If it's under the mattress it's not taxed. (talking U.S. taxes)  Income is taxed.  Assets aren't taxed.  Unless you mean that inflation eats away at it.  In which case you're saying bitcoin is a good idea.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:02:01
Keep track of the addresses. You want to attribute the sales to purchases you made more than a year ago so that it's taxed as capital gains instead of ordinary income.  So if you can say the 1 btc you sold was one you purchased 2.5 years ago for $4.5k, then you would owe gains tax on $13k. Talk to a tax accountant or specialist though.  Also, they don't really need to know how much you're hodling unless you're also asking them for advice on how to do future sales.  Also, if you aquired any of it from mining, then it's taxable as normal income during that year at the btc-dollar exchange rate at the time you received the btc from mining.

Instead of sending to billing you send to billing  So the receiver can use as many unique addresses (1234yadayada maps to a unique address) as they want.

And if the unique part is wrong then the owner of gas.provider.bitcoin can deal with it according to their publicized policy.

You didn't answer my question.  Since the 10% haircut in the article is currently hypothetical, and since there is no written regulation or law on its implementation, I am wondering why you state it would be unlawful to buy bitcoins or just take cash from your account.
Again, if you have money in your wallet when they implement this measure, will you be required to pay a 10% tax on it?  Or do they expect that nobody will have any money outside of a bank account what so ever?  If having some money on your person or in your house is okay, then is there some limit?
Please answer those questions.  I understand that evading taxation is unlawful.  But planning so that your assets are not subject to tax is not.

The complexity, called "difficulty," is automatically adjusted periodically and is done so based upon recent (approximately the last two weeks) network mining performance.  When the network ~~hashing power goes up~~ begins solving blocks too quickly, the difficulty is increased accordingly.  While it is possible that the rate of increase may appear exponential at some point, it only does this if the hashing power of the network is increasing exponentially.  If the increase in hashing power levels off then the changes in difficulty will also level off.

I never understand this question, which is repeated once per day here.  Let's say dude  bought a doorbell with USD.  He could have opted to buy bitcoins instead, but he didn't.  Is he less stupid?  Whenever you spend ANY money on a doorbell or any other object, there is an associated opportunity cost.
Look at it from another perspective.  If, to use your words, you **know** bitcoin is going to the moon, and you also know you're going to buy $500 worth of stuff over 3 months that can be purchased with USD or bitcoin, why wouldn't you just buy $500 worth of bitcoin right now?  Then, as the exchange rate climbs, you make your planned purchases over the 3 months.  If you do that, then you would have some money left over whereas if you kept it in USD, you would have none of the $500.

I think the current "stabilized" price is due to a balance between the upward pressure of a steady increase in adoption, use, and publicity and the downward pressure of early/long-time miners realizing their dream of cashing out around $900 - $1,000.

Unless cashintocoins has changed their process since early December (when I tried them), I don't see how it can't be considered money laundering.

Your title is quite misleading.  The calculator just multiplies the current exchange rate by the amount of BTC you enter.  The tax liability, as discussed in the very short blog post, is treated as capital gains.  The blog post does not explain what that means though:  To figure your tax liability, you need to actually sell the coins.  Then subtract the basis (purchase cost + fees) from the final sale price - fees.

Technically, there isn't anything preventing it.  Obviously they'd run into a lot of legal problems if they did this.  But there are other scenarios in which they do everything in a legal manner and you still lose your coins stored there (like if they are hacked or one individual employee embezzles).  You can't control that stuff.  But you can control your coins.  Never keep your coins at Coinbase, in any shared wallet, or in any wallet where you do not have exclusive control of the private keys.

You can truly believe in bitcoin and still run a business in a prudent manner.  If you cannot rely on bitcoin to hold a steady value then, for most businesses, it would be foolish to not exchange the bitcoins they receive.
When bitcoin exchange values become more stable AND your business can pay its vendors in bitcoin, then it will make sense to keep the bitcoins.  That can never happen until many many more businesses accept them as payment.  And for them to jump in and accept bitcoin while the exchange rate is irratic, they have to be able to do instant conversions.
Vendors (b2b businesses) are not likely to quickly adopt bitcoin en-masse.  Give it a little time.  The transactional savings will get their attention.  But the tax and regulatory environment needs to mature.  Vendors doing frequent bank wires and/or international transactions will be the first large adopters.
I think that any merchant or vendor accepting bitcoin at this point is good for the system, regardless of what they do with it behind the scenes.  If they begin by doing instant conversions, they will modify that behavior when it makes sense for their business.

By accepting in BTC to begin with, you are reducing your transaction costs by 1% - 2%.  That's a lot of money for the large enterprise that you describe.
Also, the bitcoin system is evolving.  You won't always need/want to do immediate conversions for BTC purchases.  
As a large consumer facing organization, it seems that if you have customers that want to pay with bitcoin, and that process will also save you money, it is a no-brainer to accept it.

An investment that has a good chance of having better returns than just hanging on to the bitcoin.  Additionally, given the fact that bitcoin itself is very risky, there would have to be a very high confidence that the investment vehicle would at least hold its value.  Stated another way, it is already a high risk to be holding bitcoins.  If you then risk those bitcoins on a bitcoin based investment, you now need that fledgling company to succeed on top of needing bitcoin to succeed.

What is broken is that it is a pull payment system that puts the responsibility for securely handling your credit info on every party touching the txn.  When one of the parties in that chain fails, they expose you to risk outside the scope of the original transaction.  And they don't necessarily bear the cost of making it right.  Whole industries have evolved just to mitigate the risks, costs, and other burdens inherent to this structure.
Bitcoin provides a push payment structure where each party is responsible for the security of their own funds.  The failure of one party to meet their responsibility does not expose other transaction parties to risk outside the scope of the transaction.

In the U.S. they take it directly from each paycheck also.  But it is an "estimate."  So you still have to file a tax return.  If they took too much during the year then you get a refund.  Of course, unless you have a good amount of other income, the amount they take from your paychecks over the year is always more than you owe.  You have some say in how much they take out by adjusting your deductions (basically how many mouths you're feeding).
So 1) a lot of morons file their tax returns and think (even brag) they didn't have to pay any taxes cause they're getting a refund, 2) almost everyone is loaning the government money with no interest, and 3) if you wind up with a large refund there is no retribution against the government for having taken an excessive amount, but if you wind up owing more than $500, they can fine you for not having enough deducted from each paycheck.

These proceedings can really be used to highlight just how onerous the control is that state and federal governments have over the simple act of moving and spending your own money - something that most people perceive to be a basic right. The more publicity they get the better.
But the bottom line is that regulators can't stop direct transfer of BTC from one person or business to another and they can't stop in-person exchanges of BTC for fiat.  So their only angle is to clamp down on the already regulated industries.

Actually, the comment "This is why we need bitcoin" neither proves nor disproves the facts listed at the top.  Do you dispute them?  If so, please elaborate on the errors of the opening post.
"This is why we need bitcoin," however, does address the implicit point that governments like to tax and take. With bitcoin, governments can still levy taxes, but the person/entity being taxed has a choice as to if and when they will comply.  (yes there would be consequences for not paying, but the person has that choice.  Also, the "when" is a big deal as you might have other obligations.)

Sure it carries over.  But the overall question is like saying "Company X is going to build an exchange, do you think you'll use it?" when you don't know who company X is yet and you have no idea of the quality of the exchange.
In the OP scenario, is the new company going to assume the debts of Mt. Gox and make the customers whole?  What currencies will they allow?  How sound is the code on the new site?  How transparent are they?  What are their security and cold storage policies?  Are they competent in legal matters for the jurisdictions in which they are trading?  Do they have sound banking relationships so they can stay open?  What are their account verification requirements?
Like I said, you can't really answer your question because it doesn't really give you any foundation for formulating an opinion.  We know the foundation can't be: It will be just like Mt. Gox is now.  Cause if it's the same, then the answer is no.  So what will be different about the new company?  Is it just the code?  Just the staff?  The staff and the code?  Just the security practices?  Security practices and new code but keep the old staff?  The OP question doesn't really mean anything.

Accounting and common sense.  Any NORMAL financial organization that is managing even a small number of deposits and withdrawals for customer accounts would have a daily (at least) reconciliation report. Among other things, such a report would compare their liabilities in the form of customer accounts with their internal accounts that are holding the offsetting assets.  At some level in those normal organizations would be one or more people that don't go home until those numbers balance.

The design deficiency wasn't solely responsible for Mt. Gox's loss of assets.  The malleability issue cannot, by itself, be exploited to steal coins.  Gox ignored the fact that the transaction hash is not fixed until the transaction is confirmed.

I wholeheartedly agree that it needs to be extremely easy to make the POS payments. However I cannot see merit in flipping from push payments to pull payments.  Pull payments are the albatross that make the current credit card system inherently unsecure.  There needs to be some active and verifiable participation on the part of the customer to send the money.  If that is not a fundamental element of the payment system, then the future will be loaded with work-arounds and band-aids to fight the inevitable fraud.

I think you can reasonably compare the malleability issue with faults found in other widely used protocols or standards.  For instance the email protocol allows one to forge the SMTP headers of an email.  The malleability issue and the forged header issue are both flaws in the respective PROTOCOLs.  Protocols and standards don't have bugs.  Software written to use these protocols should be designed to avoid these flaws.  If you write software that does not avoid these flaws and instead relies upon data that may have been manipulated, then your software is vulnerable and probably has one or more bugs.  Mt Gox chose to rely on data that was known to be subject to manipulation.

This is off course from your original question and doesn't really answer my question.  If you can't purchase the car with USD/CC because you don't have enough USD, then you no longer have the question about whether to use bitcoins vs. dollars to purchase the car.  The question is now whether or not to buy the car.  If you do, you’ll be spending bitcoin.  This is an opportunity cost decision.  There are pros and cons to having a car.  Do these out weigh the pros and cons of not buying the car and keeping the bitcoin?  Everyone's situation is different.
Obviously you may want to use a credit card precisely because you don't have enough money at the moment to make a needed purchase.   Currently, if that is the case, then you need to use the CC or some other type of credit.  Remember, however, that credit cards serve two major functions: First they serve as a method of payment, and second they serve as a revolving credit mechanism.  If, like a considerable minority of people, you only use them as a method of payment (you pay your CC bill in full every month and never incur interest charges), then bitcoin can be used as a replacement.  This is what most people think about when discussing this topic and is the scenario that applies to your original question and my follow-up question.  If, on the other hand, you utilize the credit aspect, then there is currently no widely available and trusted bitcoin replacement.  That is likely just a matter of time though.  There is nothing stopping credit card companies from honoring bitcoin purchases just as they would a foreign currency purchase.

Just my opinion, but it seems very pointless to speculate about specific details of how technology will work over 100 years from now.  Having said that, if bitcoin is still around at that point, I think there would be a lot more than 10,000 txns per block.  Also, fees are variable and will move to a balance that supports miners while remaining cost effective for users.  If that balance can't be met then the incentive mechanism will need to change or bitcoin would die.

Thanks, but I'm still a little confused as the term "EasyCoin" does not appear in the text you have pasted.  So, in the text you have pasted, is "Neo" short for "Neo EasyCoin"?  Or is "EasyCoin" a service/product offered by "Neo"?
I guess another way to ask it is: Is there a difference between "Neo" and "Neo EasyCoin"?  If so, what is the difference?

You can add the public address to a blockchain wallet as a read-only address.  I don't like the idea of aggregating that information for anyone though, so I just use a spreadsheet with the public payment addresses. Each address is a hyperlink to blockchain.info/address/&lt;address&gt; so I can check the balance at any time.

You realize the gain (or loss) when you part with the bitcoin.  What you sell or trade them for (money, gold, merchandise, sex, etc.) doesn't matter.
The fact that it may be difficult for the IRS to track the exchange does not change the fact that you are liable for tax on any gain.  The gain is determined by using the equivalent USD value of the sale and subtracting the original cost (again USD or equivalent USD) of the BTC.

It is the author that fails at math.  They say that 25% of people have heard of it (that's what 3 out of 4 haven't heard of it means).  Then they say that 25% of respondents think it hurts the world economy.  Which means they are saying 100% of the number of people that have heard of bitcoin have that opinion.  And 38% of all respondents think it hurts the U.S. economy.  Since only 25% have heard of it, that means that 150% (roughly) of the number of people that have even heard of it have this opinion about it.

If I use a visa card that is issued by a US bank to buy breakfast in Madrid, the café will be paid in euros even though I paid in USD.  The conversion is done (by the visa payment network) for the convenience of the merchant so that they get the currency they need right now.  This is no different than bitpay converting bitcoin to USD for newegg.  It doesn't mean bitcoin is not a viable currency and it doesn't mean that the instant conversion will be the norm in the future.

The OP theory is that he is risking going to jail for years or decades BECAUSE he is honoring a gag order.  So the choice is honoring the gag order and being seen as an asshole and leaving thousands of customers out in the cold and going to jail OR breaking the gag order and going to jail.  Either way you go to jail.  Like I said, if I'm going to jail, I would have taken the option that leaves things out in the open.
But that's the whole point of my post.  The theory doesn't make sense.  The originator of a gag order wouldn't have let things unfold like they have.  If he's under a gag order because of Mt. Gox and/or his own criminal behavior, they would have just frozen everything and shut it down.  If he's under a gag order because of wrong doing outside of Mt. Gox, then... that doesn't explain why Gox went in the shitter.

That's a leap that needs substantiating.
* Define "dead".  What differentiates dead from just not needed or used for a really long time?
* How would recovering "dead" wallets help the bitcoin economy?  "There will only ever be 21 million" doesn't matter because bitcoins can be divided to infinitely small values (8 digits now, but that can be expanded if needed).
* Why should that money go to miners?

It just means that by mining, you don't need to go through an exchange (a regulated bottle-neck).  But once you have the coins, it doesn't really matter how you acquired them.
The sole difference is that coins acquired by solo-mining (i.e. not part of a pool) that have never been spent will have zero taint because they are brand new.
ALL bitcoins were originally obtained from mining.

The adjectives OP chose could have been better.  However the fact that bitcoin is regulated by cryptography, math, and rules on minting (inflation) and deflation (limited supply - expanding market) , and that it is open source really can't be disputed.  Now the cryptography could be broken sometime.  And the math proved wrong.  And the rules changed.  And the source code becomes not so open.  But then it is the nature of regulations that they change from time to time.

If you define "user" as anyone that has ever owned any amount of bitcoin, then the absolute upper limit would be the number of addresses in the blockchain.  (not saying there are anywhere near that many users, just that the number of users can't be any higher than that number)
Ultimately, this type of metric will probably be estimated by how many people use specific bitcoin services once the infrastructure matures.  But given its decentralized structure combined with the fact that people move bitcoins for very different reasons (purchases, speculation, remittance, etc.) it will likely be a hard number to pin down for quite some time.

Gox didn't use unique/new addresses to send from, so this would be very hard to find unless you have an address to which a double payout was sent - and none of those people are talking.
Contrast this with Coinbase.  When you send btc to an address they fulfill the withdrawal in two steps.  First they create a new address and fund it with the amount of your withdrawal.  Then they send the money from that address to the payment address you gave them.  It's very easy for them to verify whether or not you received a specific withdrawal AND it is very easy for them to do a resend from the same intermediate address so as to prevent a double payout.

The point is that the programmer(s) at Mt Gox should have noticed the flaw and programmed around it.

Yes, it would be pretty hard for them to make a legal statement saying the losses were caused by malleability since malleability doesn't cause losses.
The losses occurred because Mt. Gox responded poorly to malleated transactions.  Losses mounted and went undetected to the point of insolvency due to the lack of internal controls and audits at Mt. Gox.

There is nothing that prevents somebody from selling bitcoin by simply giving the private key to the buyer.  The ownership of the value can be transferred without actually moving the bitcoins to a new address.  So one could claim that they did this soon after their traceable original purchase and just blew the proceeds on a night/week/month of partying. Obviously that type of transfer wouldn't be a wise move on the part of the buyer, but it is still a plausible method of transfer and one that would be very difficult to disprove.
[edit]Even more to the point: The original purchase could have gone directly to somebody else's address - Either as a gift or as a payment.[/edit]

One way is to use coinbase.com.  It's not an exchange, but just a way to buy/sell BTC with transfers directly from/to your bank account.  The transactions are not instantaneous, but the price locks when you initiate the transaction.  If you are looking to buy BTC for spending and/or long-term investment, then it works pretty good.  You can also set up recurring buys.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:26:08
Yes. And then periodically transfer them out to individual addresses.  Or just use a new tip address each day (rather than for every tip).

The correct answer (which doesn't involve bitcoin) would be something like: Why in the f*ing hell would I use a website that is designed to mine, aggregate, and profit from personal data, and which has a terrible track record for security concerns, to send money??

@_date: 2013-12-03 20:20:53
Interesting.  They may in fact not be a money transmitter, however their statement that they are not a money transmitter does not make it so.  If they are indeed making individual purchases through an exchange for every order they take, then maybe they can skirt that title.  However I question whether that is what technically happens since they would be taking a huge risk when they allow people to lock-in the price when an order is placed.  I suppose they could be making the BTC purchase right away and then just holding your BTC for 5-7 days.

Unless you are using an off-the-shelf shopping cart that already has bitcoin support, you're going to need to recode/customize some part of it no matter what.  The extent of code changes of course depends upon the modularity with which the shopping cart was originally built.
Integrating bitpay or coinbase would be similar to how paypal is integrated, so your best bet would be to copy that code path and change where needed.

Yes.  The "watch-only" option just uses the public address.  The private key is never in the blockchain wallet.  You can also just enter the address into the search field on the website to get the address balance and transaction list.  Using the search option is not as easy, but it also never ties that address to your blockchain login data.

It is easy in the increasingly fascist arrangements in the U.S.  The government doesn't have to ban it.  The banks just shut down accounts that are moving money to or from exchanges.

People will stop buying bitcoins as an investment WHEN it becomes more widely used as a currency.  Causality questions aside, stability in price and wide use as a currency will go hand-in-hand.
For someone that believes bitcoin will continue to rise in value for the immediate future: If they know they can buy things they normally need/want with bitcoin, doesn't it make sense to put some of their fiat into bitcoin in anticipation of spending it?  Whether it's a week down the road or saving for 6 months, if the expectation is that bitcoin will be worth more than the fiat, then they are making money off the practice.

When it was first hitting the $800 range, I had told the only other person that knows I own any bitcoin that I thought it would go over $1,000 a little ways and then crash and then stabilize somewhere under $1,000.  But when it was happening and went over $1,000, I couldn't get myself to buy into the idea that it would go down right away.  So I just held on to my coins.

The pricing you describe was done because the CC companies prohibited merchants from charging customers more if they used a CC.  It is indeed engrained in the way business is done.  It may take some time, but I think businesses will begin to take advantage of it by offering discounts to those that do not pay with a CC.  A few might go the other way by lowering prices slightly and charging a convenience fee when you use a CC.
Receiving payment by cash, debit, or bitcoin means that they get rid of those CC fees AND get payment immediately instead of waiting 2-3 days for card settlements.  This is sort of a big deal for merchants in a low margin industry and with tight cash-flow.

It seems that for the insurance to be effective, it would need to be held with a company separate from the company holding the coins.  For instance, company A establishes a bitcoin bank to hold funds securely.  Through audits and other means they establish a sufficient rating with insurance company B.  Consumer C takes out an insurance policy with insurance company B and deposits coins with company A.  If A goes under or absconds with the funds C is covered by their policy with B.  If B goes under then C needs to 1) get a new policy with another company, or 2) withdraw their funds from A, or 3) leave their funds with A with no insurance.

BIP38 uses the pass phrase you provide to encrypt the private key.  What is printed on the paper wallet is the encrypted private key.  So when you import the private keys, you will be asked for the BIP38 pass phrase.  You will not be able to import them without it.

I have to question the wisdom (intent?) of the Mulligan Mint "bitcoin coin" design.  It is a commemorative coin, and not a physical bitcoin (like a casascius coin).  Although it looks somewhat like a casascius coin, it doesn't give you possession/control of a bitcoin anymore than their buffalo coin gives you a buffalo.  Even though there is no denomination on the coin (like 1 BTC), the coin design might lead someone to assume that the coin represents 1 BTC.  The coin sells for $25.01
[edit]Clarification: I'm not thinking that people would buy it from the website thinking it was worth 1 BTC.  Rather that someone might resell them to unwary noobs and represent that they are worth 1 BTC.[/edit]

The card companies NEVER cancel all of the cards in a breach.  They limit themselves to 1) giving you the benefit of the doubt when you report fraudulent charges, and 2) sometimes providing 1 years worth of credit monitoring service.
When there are fraudulent charges you are still the one that needs to initiate corrective action and you are at the mercy of the CC company as to whether or not you will be reimbursed.  ALSO, those "fraudulent" charges are usually actual charges to some merchant who may then be required to eat the transaction.
If the fraudsters succeed in subsequently opening new accounts or taking out new loans with your information then you are on your own to resolve it.
When bitcoin is used, any sensible merchant will NOT have their private keys exposed to the transaction network or internet.  They then become much lower risk targets.  And the customers' financial integrity is not risked just because they chose to shop there.

No, the miners are in competition with one another.  Only a set amount of bitcoins can be mined.  That rate is currently 25 bitcoins approximately every 10 minutes.

I didn't get here because of the money.  Or the speculating.  It was the technology.  And the potential.  You're talking about bitcoin as an investment vehicle.  Like it's a stock.

Well, there are different scenarios: 1) Your items are priced in BTC and you hang onto the BTC after the sale (that is, you don't exchange them right away), 2) Your items are priced in BTC but you exchange the BTC for other currency right after the sale, and 3) Your items are marked in another currency, but you let the customer pay with BTC at the current exchange rate.
For 1, I think that refunds in BTC (same amount as original purchase) should be okay.
For 3, refunds in the original currency OR BTC at the current exchange rate should be expected.
Scenario 2 is the sticky one.  You really need to decide ahead of time how to handle this and then make sure the customer is informed up front.  Without any warnings, if your items are priced in BTC and they pay in BTC, then I think they have a right to expect refunds for the same amount of BTC as they paid.  If it is made exceptionally clear that refunds will be at the exchange rate in effect at the time the item is returned, then you might not get too many complaints.

It doesn't take a week for an ACH txn to clear.  It can take as little as one day.  For your very 1st txn, I would guess that coinbase does an ACH prenote txn, so the actual txn might not be submitted for settlement for 2 or 3 days.  After that there is no reason they can't send it in their next daily ACH batch.  My txns have been showing up cleared on my bank account (and also at coinbase) the next day.
Having said all of that, coinbase will still hold your coins until the date they stipulated at purchase.  This is sound policy on their part as it greatly reduces their exposure to purchases from stolen bank accounts.

A lot of speculators have crash-protection sell orders in place for when the price starts dropping.  They set these for when the price drops by 15%, 20%, etc., whatever their comfort level is so that they don't lose absolutely everything.

They will require that you link a bank account in order to buy or sell.  You will be able to verify the account by either giving them the userid &amp; pwd you use to access your online info with the bank OR you can verify by having them do 2 small deposits and corresponding withdrawal from your account.  After the deposits &amp; withdrawal post on your account you return to the coinbase website and provide the amounts (this is how paypal does it).
There is no such thing as a USD deposit with them.  When you want to buy you enter an order.  They will lock in the price and then initiate an ACH withdrawal from your account.  When they get the money they release the bitcoins to your account.  When you want to sell it is the exact opposite.  They will deposit the proceeds of the sale directly to your bank account.  They don't hold your USD.  The bitcoin wallet attached to your account works like other bitcoin wallets.  So after you buy you should transfer the bitcoins to some other wallet.  And only transfer coins back to your coinbase wallet when you are ready to sell.

@_date: 2013-11-12 18:40:52
Mining is the process of transaction processing.  They are not things you can separate.  When you "solve" a block of transactions you are rewarded with an amount of bitcoins.  You also earn the transaction fees for the transactions in the block.  The entire process is called "mining."  The miner can't control the block reward nor the fee amount attached to transactions.  I am hazy on the fee implications, but I think (could well be wrong, someone else can correct or confirm) that they can, to some degree, skip transactions with no or low fees attached.

Yes, this sounds like it would be a great blessing.
Seriously, if any major government does this, I would think it would be perceived as bad for the traditional paper version of the currency, so people would want to unload it.  It stinks of government overreach and authoritarian monitoring.  People with any knowledge would avoid it and possibly even flock to bitcoin.

Nobody knows what's going to happen to the price in the next few hours or days.  If there were anyone that knows this answer for certain you can bet they are not wasting their time here.  The price of bitcoin is and will remain very volatile.  If you believe in the long-term viability of bitcoin (as I do) then you probably also believe that it will be worth much more in the future.  In that case you need to just buy.  It may go down right after you buy.  It may even go down a lot.  But if you are correct about the long-term prospects then you also believe that it must recover and will continue to climb.

It's not my mistake.  It is their mistake.  If they behave this way then it is their own funds that will be stolen, not those of their customers.  From your "welp, in libertarian utopia" tirade (WTF is that, anyway?), this is a detail that I think you are trying to remain oblivious to.  Merchants will likely pay much more attention to payment processing security when it is their own money on the line.  And if they don't it only puts themselves at risk, not their customers.
tl;dr: There is no need for libertarian utopians, statist lemmings, banking shills, or anyone else to worry if a merchant is lose with their bitcoin transaction and payment information.  Only the merchant gets hurt.

Wow - Congratulations!
I guess my first course of action would be to verify what you have.  If the wallet software you're using says you have that many, then you probably do.  Still, you can verify by checking the individual payment addresses at blockchain.info.  Just copy and paste the public addresses (one at a time) into the search field on that website.  It will show you the current balance.
Next you should decide how much to hold onto (definitely hold on to most of it) and how much you want to cash out.  Send the amount you want to hold to a paper wallet.  See bitaddress.org.  There are other secure wallet options too.
Then sell what you've decided.  If you are selling more than 100 at a time, I would recommend spacing the sales out over several hours.  I don't know which exchange would be best if you are operating from Canada, hopefully others have that info.
Good luck!

Yes.  I can login to coinbase from one computer on which I had previously checked the option to not get the verification code for 30 days.  But I cannot complete the login on any other device or computer because I never get the SMS verification code sent to my phone.  I know they have the correct phone number because 1) it has worked in the past and was in fact working yesterday afternoon, and 2) when I click "code not working" and opt to have them call my phone, they do in fact call the phone, but I just get a message saying "I'm sorry, an application error has occurred.

Ha.  Welcome to BDTA.  My name is Henry.  I used to try the day trader thing at work.  I kept noticing that my end of day stash was always a little lower than my beginning of day stash.  Finally I looked myself in the face and realized that I had a problem.  I transferred my money away from the exchange.  Then I put it in a wallet that I left at home.  I've been DT free for 27 days.

I don't see what the issue is with refunds when items are priced in USD (Euro, etc.) and the customer pays with bitcoin.  In that scenario, the cart total is calculated in fiat and the customer pays a bitcoin equivalent at the current market rate.  So why don't they just do the refunds the same way?  If the item was $45 and the user paid in bitcoin, then when they return it they should get $45 worth of bitcoin at the rate that is current when the refund is processed.  I think this is the only reasonable way until bitcoin is widely accepted AND the value becomes stable.

Your question is really about whether or not to spend money on a haircut.  Say you only have USD to spend on a haircut.  But you know that you can also buy BTC with that money and it will likely go up in value.  What do you do?
The idea about not being able to spend BTC because it goes up in value is a false distraction.  If you always put all of your fiat currency into bitcoin and the value of bitcoin always goes up relative to the fiat, then it actually makes more sense to do just that.  Put it all in and spend when you need to.

That's because your vanity address was not generated with BIP38.  When you generate a paper wallet using BIP38, the public and private keys are generated in the normal manner.  Then the private key is encrypted using the pass phrase you provide.  Encrypting the private key is the whole point of BIP38.  It provides an additional layer of security in case someone gets their hands or eyes on your paper wallet.

When trades occur on an exchange, the money is just moved around in a database.  The only activity on blockchain addresses occurs with bitcoin deposits and withdrawals.  And you would need to know the exchange addresses to track it.
So the tell would be that the number of bitcoins moving in and out of the exchange addresses does not support the trade volume on the exchange when compared to other exchanges.  Again, you would need to know all of the exchange addresses.  That would be a tall order since there is at least one address for every account and most people generate new addresses frequently.

I would add that these types of bids, to protect against total loss in a crash, were responsible for the depth of the crash that happened earlier this week.  When the value was around $800, a lot of speculators probably established such bids at $690, $650, $600, $550, and down and at every conceivable tick mark in that range. So once a modest crash started, it just kept triggering these bids which kept pushing the price lower.  To be sure there was a lot of manual panic selling, but the standing sell orders played a big part of it.

The primary current effect of altcoins on bitcoin is that it confuses newcomers and slows the adoption of bitcoin.  That's actually probably a good thing right now as the bitcoin infrastructure has some growing to do.

ACH just stinks, period.  Coinbase will batch their transactions once a day into a file.  Most entities using ACH will do this late in the evening or early in the morning.  The file will then be routed to their ODFI (bank) early in the business hours.  The ODFI will process those transactions an hour or so later.  The transactions get routed in a process that may have more than one hop.  If their ODFI is also your bank's ODFI, then it's quick.  If not then it needs to get routed to your bank's ODFI.  I'm not sure, but I suspect each hop equals one business day.  Your bank will fetch it's ACH file from its ODFI some day around 10:00 am.  It may post the transactions immediately, or it may post them with tomorrow's date.
Just repeating - ACH stinks.
[edit]for clarification: ODFIs are usually large banks like JPMorgan or Wells Fargo.  Nobody is supposed to route their own transactions.  That is, everyone needs an ODFI, even banks.[/edit]

What others invest doesn't matter.  If you've decided that bitcoin is a wise investment for you, then yes, investing a small amount at regular intervals is a sound strategy.  That is true of any investment vehicle.  You do not need to buy whole bitcoins.  You just buy $50 or $100 worth every two weeks or every month, whatever works for your budget and comfort level.  If you are in the U.S. then you can do this easily now with coinbase.com.

Not like we do with cash today.  I suppose it is not out of the question that some centralized entities (governments, banks, whatever) would start issuing notes backed by bitcoin.  In that case they would function like old reserve notes (which were literally backed by gold or silver) and be redeemable for bitcoin.  As we found out with gold, this is a slippery slope though.

Blockchain.info is totally different.  They don't put account owners coins into their own wallets.  They just help the account holders manage the keys to their wallets.
Coinbase, on the other hand, maintains what you consider to be your coins in their own wallets - to which they alone have the private keys.  Since the sending of coins is automated then the code on their servers has access to the private keys of their "hot" wallets.  Given the fact that those are high value and high visibility targets, it makes very good sense to keep most of the coins in off-line wallets and to only keep what they feel is needed in those hot wallets.
Imagine the comments here if they were compromised and it was found that they were keeping everything exposed in hot wallets.  The only "issue" here is that they underestimated the amount needed in the hot wallets.

You shouldn't use any storage that doesn't give you exclusive access to the private key.  Although you can buy and sell bitcoins from them, and they provide bitcoin storage, they are neither an exchange nor a true wallet.  Coinbase should just be utilized as an entry/exit point.  Put some USD in to get bitcoins, then send the bitcoins to your own wallet.  If you want to sell, then send bitcoins to your coinbase account and sell them right away.  Keep your bitcoins in a true bitcoin wallet - one for which you have exclusive access to the private keys.

The price at which you bought is locked in.  Since the price is steadily rising right now that is probably okay.  The transaction should be marked as Pending.  If you look at the details it will have an estimated date and time when your coins will be available.  They have hit that date/time the few times I've used them so far.  After 30 days of good behavior with them the time delay should drop dramatically.  If you provide credit card info then they will make them nearly instant.

I don't hate on them.  I just don't use them.  And the reason I don't use them is that I was having difficulty getting withdrawals out of their system in May and June.  The comments I see here and on bitcointalk tell me I made a good decision.  They are terrible in their customer communictions and they enroll new customers onto their site knowing that those people are not going to be able to withdraw their money for weeks or months.

It doesn't say they were storing the credit card numbers.  The swipe data is what was taken.  Most likely the intruder collected swipe data as it was transmitted within the Target system on its way to the card processor.
[edit]actually the USA Today article doesn't even include that detail. But the articles at CNN and PBS do have that detail and that is where I saw that it was the swipe data.[/edit]

If someone doesn't already have some bitcoin for spending, then yes, it would be an extra step (actually several extra steps).  Most places don't require that you use bitpay though.  In this case they should use PayPal, or a CC, or whatever else they've used in the past.
For users that already have bitcoin though, no, Bitpay is not an extra step.  If for example, I plan to spend $500 over the next 4 months on things I know I can purchase with bitcoins.  AND I believe (i.e. speculate) that the value of bitcoins will generally go up during that time.  THEN I might want to take an opportunistic risk and buy $500 of bitcoin now to spend over those 4 months.  If I am right and the price rises then I will wind up with some bitcoin change after my purchases are made.

One other reason I haven't seen mentioned yet - When you go to check out with a credit card, you give the other party all the information they need to make additional charges on your card.  That's not true when you pay with bitcoin.
I'm not implying that keeping bitcoins safe is foolproof.  But you can personally control the safety of your bitcoins when you buy with bitcoins.  The same is not true of credit card purchases.

You generally have 4-5 minutes to cancel a transaction.  Did you try to cancel one of them?  Did you try coinbase support?  Send an email clarifying that it was your intention to only buy once so you are on record.  They generally acknowledge that they have issues and will work to make it right.

Are your prices quoted in USD or in BTC?  If your prices are in USD, and you are just allowing customers to pay for their USD total in BTC at the current exchange rate, then it seems that refunds would be paid back at the exchange rate that is current at the time of refund.  Put another way, you are providing a service that lets your customers transact in BTC for items that are priced in USD.  The USD price (and refund amount) are constant.
If you are pricing your items in BTC, then it seems that your refunds should be in BTC also.
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:47:46
Since these are ACH transactions, coinbase doesn't really control when your bank posts the transaction to your bank account (except that they should provide an expected settlement date).  They only control when they send their ACH file to their processor.  The individual transactions are then routed to the different banks and they determine when they will actually post the transaction.
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:52:18
BTC is an unofficial (not ISO standard) abbreviation.  When an ISO abbreviation is finally designated, it will start with an X.  Most likely XBT.  So you might want to consider that instead.

This is something the bitcoin foundation should be doing. But...
If we could get an approximation of the number of banking (and CC processing) facilities around the world.  Headquarter and regional type office buildings, main banks, branches, ATMs, etc.  Then compute a list of average resources consumed by each type of facility.  Then do the math to get a list of types and totals of resources consumed.

It sounds like you followed the link at blockchain to the cashintocoins website.  That is where you find the three deposit methods of Wells Fargo, Credit Union, or BOA.  (please clarify if that's not right).  So just wanted to call your attention to the fact that it is not part of blockchain, but an independent service run by someone else.
Anyway Chase doesn't ever need to know this has anything to do with bitcoin.
This is all from the cashintocoins "how to" page and confirmed from my one-time experience:  What you will need to do is pick one of those three deposit options.  That is, find a branch office for Wells Fargo or BOA, or one of the credit unions on their list, that is near you.  Fill out your deposit info on the cashintocoins website and print the confirmation sheet.  Go withdraw cash (check is not okay, cashiers check is probably okay, but I'm not certain) from your bank.  Go to the deposit location you chose.  Deposit the money to the bank account indicated on your deposit information printout.  On the deposit receipt, write the transaction number that is on your cashintocoins confirmation.  Take a picture of the receipt and email it to cashintocoins.

Technically, there's nothing.  Search in this subreddit and also google for "bitcoin arbitrage".  You will find that the differences in exchange rates are due to the difficulty in moving money back and forth and/or fee structures and/or other factors that push the profit for doing this down to 0.

The security aspect of storing in a bank is still there.  The contractual details will be a bit different (there are two recent threads on btc vaults/banks).  Essentially funds would be insured by another company and you would probably pay a fee to deposit there.  That arrangement wouldn't appeal to everyone, but it would appeal to many.

The ability and method used to set a specific transaction fee is a function of the wallet from which you are sending.  What wallet are you sending from?  Maybe someone familiar with that wallet can say if and how you would set the fee.

As hotlogs put it - desire to buy does not equal demand.  They may want to buy*, but since they cannot move fiat to the exchange they are not able to buy.  So you have a lot of people wanting to sell and not very many people able to buy.
*The government has given strong signals that bitcoin is out of favor which is enough to squash demand.  The consequences of skating around rules on a technicality (referring to "as long as moving from fiat currency to BTC is easier") are much more harsh in communist countries than in western countries.

Try localbitcoins.  You may be able to find someone nearby.  You will probably still need to pay cash, but you could get that directly from your bank and avoid the wire/ach delays.
You could also try coinbase.  You can generally get to the 2nd level verification in a matter of minutes. If you can then provide a VISA card number for backup verification, you can do an instant buy of upto 1 btc.  The money still comes from your bank account, and the VISA info is just in case the ACH doesn't go through.
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:53:29
Unless it is a very small amount it will still go through, but may take 30 to 60 minutes to see the 1st confirmation.

The URL and port number have changed a few times, so be sure to look at the latest info on the pool website and make sure you are pointing to the right location.  After that then make sure your miner name matches the one on the pool website.  If that doesn't help, you should probably follow the "support forum" link from the pool website.  It will take you to a long thread on bitcointalk.org.  Post a question there.  People familiar with both guiminer and the pool frequent the thread.
P.S. Unless you have a very new ASIC rig, the reward you get from mining will never equal the amount of time and electricity you put into it.

I prefer android, but my employer makes me carry an iPhone (that they provide).  I had put off installing the blockchain wallet app because I had heard you couldn't do much with it since it had been crippled to suit Apple.  Two days ago I finally installed it.  I have been able to send money with no problem.  My only concern is that you don't get the Custom Send options that you see on the website.  Mostly I would like to be able to pick the From address.
btw - To get to the app, I just searched for "blockchain" in the App Store.  I just made sure that the app I was downloading matched the developer info that was shown on the blockchain website.
I hope Apple doesn't read posts.

For now and the immediate future, most items will be priced in fiat.  When you pay with bitcoins, it is done at the current exchange rate.  So refunds will work the same way.  I don't think there's any confusion there.
For merchants that price their items in bitcoin and do NOT convert them to fiat, the situation would be the same - customers pay in bitcoin and refunds are in bitcoin.
The only tricky area is for merchants that are pricing items in bitcoin and then, behind the scenes, cashing them out for fiat right away.  Unless the merchant clearly states an alternative policy up front, I think the expectation of any customer would be that refunds would be in bitcoin.

Also: When a western government wants to forbid something, they make a law.  If you find a loophole, good for you.  They fix the loophole with a new law and then nobody else can do it.  When they make a law in a communist country, the spirit of the law really is the key.  If you find a loophole and get caught the best thing that can happen is that you (and only you) go to a labor camp and only for a "few" years.  Depending on other factors, including but not limited to, the mood of the official(s) involved, your past history, the past history of your family members, and how public the incident is, maybe your entire family goes to a labor camp too.  Or maybe they just execute you.
tl;dr: Some will try, but in general, people in China are not going to be rushing to find loopholes.

This kind of thing is where lawyers make a living.  I would be extremely surprised if it were cut-and-dried in even a majority of states.  More likely there is wiggle-room and subjective interpretation in exactly what needs to be done.

I firmly believe that, with a little wider adoption, it will help many would-be micro and small business people take the plunge and actually start offering their products/services for sale.  The internet removes a former barrier of marketing costs.  And bitcoin removes another intimidating barrier by allowing someone to accept payments without setting up a business bank account or payment processor.  Somebody sells a few hours of their work a month this way and it will grow.  Soon they can open that business account and take other steps to grow to a small business.

I think the only thing that is a certainty is that crypto-currency is here to stay.  And I believe it is almost as certain that a distributed, stateless currency will be the backbone of the world financial system.  However, there are still too many uncertainties and variables to have the same confidence that it will be bitcoin filling that role.
