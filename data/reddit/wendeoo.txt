so, I've lost those btc?

I was able to import the private key to Electrum, thank you so much!
Now I'm kinda trying to find the right section to spend the 0.00079 back to  1D5DMKrcQfubRjqZbz4sAK63kXTZdrtbvE, but I'm not sure where to do it...
This is what I'm seeing:
If I double click on the unconfirmed I see this:
Am I  doing something wrong? Also, there are those unconfirmed with a different icon, which I don't know what it means.
Really appreciate your help and patience my friend, don't know how to repay you

I can't believe man, it indeed confirmed! Gosh, it gave me headache! Looks like the cpfp I did thanks to your guide really worked! Man, I can't thank you enough. How can I repay your patience and kindness? Can I send you a few Bitcoins? Thank you very, very much!

Thank you for the clarification! I've searched a lot about CPFP but still don't know exactly how to do it, as most tutorials are saying to do it on Electrum, but my transaction was made from [blockchain.com]( (sorry for the .info earlier). So, even if my transaction was not made on Electrum I can use it to do the CPFP? I really don't know how to do this.

Wow, I'm gonna try this right now! Just one more noob question: how do I extract the private key?

thanks! I've read around that the 72 hours turned into 14 days... really don't know which one is true
