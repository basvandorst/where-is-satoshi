So, by providing my routing number, the USD from my bank is automatically transferred into the seller's bank, and thus the seller releases the BTC to my wallet? I don't have to do anything else?

What do you think of ClearXchange over Cash/ATM deposit?

Another problem is that for people who are young and novices to the financial system, it can be confusing when it comes to choosing and understanding how transaction methods for decentralized exchanges work (cash/atm, wire transfer, etc.), or choosing the best centralized exchange that is the most insusceptible to hacking.
For young people who's only experiences with earning money are through a checking account, Amazon gift cards, and PayPal, buying Bitcoin can be very daunting. If it wasn't for Purse.io, I would have never gotten into Bitcoin sooner.
In addition, people want simplicity. I only got to use Circle for a week until they stopped selling Bitcoin. The closest thing to Circle that I could find was Celery, with little to no verification requirements, but the long wait times and $2 fee are what's keeping me from buying for now.
I would love to get into using decentralized exchanges like Bitsquare, but I want to be 100% certain of what the heck I am doing on there before I buy.

What is Cash/ATM deposit and how exactly does it work on Bitsquare.io? Does the seller have to physically go to a branch of my bank to deposit money into my account? Can it be in a different state? That seems to be the only viable option available for U.S. users.
