Not using a stop loss is the most dangerous thing to do in the market and will result in complete loss of equity due to emotional mind traps
@_date: 2019-08-01 03:23:02
We are not playing poker this is trading
For an example you buy $100k worth of a stock at $10 the stop is there to prevent your loss of equity not to get you out like in your poker analogy
After some time market moves in your favour - the stock goes to $12 (add zeros to visualise bitcoin) now you move stops to $11.7 and ensure profit is secure
Now market moves in favour again to a new high at $14 - stop up to $12.5 as that was last level of support or use a EMA if you prefer - your choice
Market goes again higher to $16 so you move stops to $15 and enjoy life
While you were sleeping market dumps but you sold at $15 now market is at $11 you have retained profit
You re-enter when you want - trade is complete you have profit in your account
That's how you use a stop loss
@_date: 2019-08-15 10:04:32
Poker is a table card game that has better odds then slots or roulette but yes it's still a gamble
Trading and Investing are not the same thing - Investing in a farm or start-up also are not the same things
Buying a bond is not a gamble
Trading with experience and market knowledge also is not gambling
Day trading and watching youtube 'gurus' yeh probably bullshit like you are confusing this with
You think professional fund managers are gambling? You are confused and probably no idea what a stop loss is or back testing
@_date: 2019-08-19 11:09:53
Study the markets and odds and probabilities you will see there are many times when the odds are in your favour and you have an edge - these are the trades professional fund managers enter
When a country announces it will cut a central interest rate - this is not a gamble it is a certainty that you can short those yields
Likewise you can long volatility before upcoming expected volatility - its really not a gamble because its like looking across the road before crossing you know nothing is coming and its safe
With Bitcoin you are literally gambling a call option and its a greater fool trade as the asset does not create a dividend or have any substantiated business backing but yolo to the moon bro better get that lambo money right?
In short the following are not gambles at all
Fixed income from gov and corporates
Dividend paying blue chips
REITs (Property ETFs essentially)
Event trading (Central bank rate changes, VIX, Oil)

It continually varies in price due to network difficulty, and relative cost of power from the grid or however they obtain it. 
When difficulty drops, its cheaper to produce btc. When difficulty increases, it gets more expensive. this is by design. by the time we mine the last coins it will cost so much to mine because the difficulty is increasing as is the block reward halvening also.
So this means as we progress BTC will be more scarce and expensive to produce because the reward provided in blocks is smaller. Got it? Get it.. good..

As a brit there are a couple things about Craig I want to bring up.
1. He's an aussie
2. His attempt to be high class at any attempt and coming off with no class
3. His atrocious spelling.  
I know high school teachers with better spelling then Craig. If this guy is a professor, the university is not worth sweet FA. No way would someone write the way he does, and the kind of spelling he uses.  
Also in a vocal discussion, he has no class. No etiquete or social manner, he comes across as a moron. A blithering fool. He tries to use all the biggest words possible, but honestly if you put him against a real professor he just looks like a moron.  
You notice how Craigs never been to any of the prestigious places like the Oxford debating club, yet people who profess all kinds of far out concepts - much wilder than that of bitcoin appear in the debating hall. Craig has never mad such appearance, even in his first interview he claimed he would never be seen again.  
Let's just get real, his mother even said he gets carried away with his lies. He was possibly involved in BTC at the start, or maybe through some bizarre stroke of luck come across the early seeds of the BTC idea in the cypherpunks movement / mailing lists.   
He for certain is not a coder, who would create such a masterpiece and now hire coders. Secondly who the fuck would want large blocks. I am sure anyone with a basic grasp of networks understands you want as lightweight traffic as possible. There is no benefit to absurdly large blocks. It's just stupid. Craigs white papers make nonsense, he talks garbage and he is an emotional wreck.   
When asked just basic questions at a public talk (which he does in a pub cellar, of course. where else.. why not a ted talk? Why not some where prominent.. he hides in the shadows) he exploded and acted so uncouth the real character comes out. A con man. And an arrogant one at that.  
Craig has no idea of this though, his examples are always a joke. The thing about computing is it's very easy to prove something. Especially with Bitcoin, if he was the real deal - he could transfer coins from the original wallets. But he cannot. He can disclose the truth behind closed doors to a select few, now we have a tin foil hat 911 case.  
So what the fuck actually happened and will we ever know? Would it change anything if you knew?  
Even if he is Satoshi, he cant code for shit. A fact everyone seems to overlook. Satoshi started this whole thing off, why the fuck does Craig not just write more code in his expensive coding chair in front of his suits of armour? (what a wanker)  
He doesn't talk like a coder, he doesn't appear mentally disciplined either. Notice how many high level successful people are physically fit and engage in a much more charismatic world view.  
Craig talks like a confident trickster, using big words that spoof most people (absurdly) in this space. If you know a coder you trust, some computer science major who knows crypto, ask him his honest opinion. Show him Craig talking. Give it a real looking into.  
I've never met anyone who didn't say that Craig is full of shit.   
I once asked Craig some pretty open and easy to answer questions on twitter, such as why didn't he make the changes to BTC and put a pull request in. He blocked me.

Well if you use the market order it will take like 8% in fees, so if you use the limit order it will be much lower. But there is no protection that the limit order is going to execute, thats what the article is discussing...

It's a index. weighted 50/50 between gdax and bitstamp. Check the contract specification.
Look at the composite index breakdown, this is how the price is dictated.
Jan 24, 2019, 8:49:00 AM	BSTP	50.00%	3535.64
Jan 24, 2019, 8:49:00 AM	GDAX	50.00%	3534.34
Move the underlying, you move the index.

Well yeh don't over trade, only use a portion of your margin or you will get liquidated same as any margin trading platform. Set a stop, and don't over leverage your position or you will pay for it dearly. 
@_date: 2019-01-19 09:59:58
Statistically you need to win 1.4 more trades than loose to break even, even if you use a limited risk of 2%. Nice odds right

The illuminati are at it again right... Futures are regulated in a way that there are margin requirements and minimums needed to fund the account. This protects investors, bitmex removes all of this and auto liquidates you because they are so caring...
The US500 futures are highly regulated by the CFTC, insider trading is prohibited by the stocks act... If bitmex reported as much as CFTC we'd never have this swamp we are in. 
But eh the governments coming for us, something something new world order something something one world currency something something reptilian overlords
@_date: 2019-01-27 12:00:33
Liquidation price is calculated on the fly, so is your stop. If the underlying spikes +/-20% and it just so happens to liquidate / kill all the orders.. well I guess you guys are just plain unlucky.
They have publicly stated they hold a huge amount of BTC, no law stops them trading the underlying. They can see all orders and liquidation. Come on, what more does it need. Simple money, move the market - liquidate all retailer fishys and continue being a huge whale.
Only way to fix it, stop using it. CBOE futures are just as bad, price is only from Gemini. Equally easy to rig.
@_date: 2019-01-28 10:04:38
Nice, likewise Ive never been auto liquidated, i've traded on margin for many years and just found bitmex to be bizarre and setup in way that gives a disadvantage to the investor.
The article you linked is completely irrelevant and continues to rebuke my stance that the majority of retail traders on bitmex are conspiracy theorists with little comprehension of the larger markets.
In short - margin call on futures or cfd is when account closes in negative equity. Balances will be settled to zero, although you will get warning that you can deposit more or scale down.
On bitmex - it will close your position for you, no warning, no help it just takes your money for you. Because it loves you, because its better. Right.... right. Ok got it. 
I trade 200x leverage normally for many years across currencies and stocks, but bitmex is just too strange price action and the fees far outweigh the gains unless making 10%+ moves... In a flat market it's just going to line bitmex's pockets. That's the conflict of interest.
@_date: 2019-01-19 10:53:52
\^ basically this... Read a trading book before using margin man!! You will get rekt otherwise..
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:52:00
Taking as close an analogy as I can - gold (or any precious metal) is mined at a cost. This we will call the floor as in the production floor. the ceiling is the maximum a client is willing to pay before saying wtf.  
This is like your support and resistance on the gold / silver / whatever precious metal market.   
In BTC we have the same dynamic, but also LOADS of people who  
1. dont know this  
2. never traded before  
3. think this is a lottery ticket  
Because of this, those people are being run around by technical analysis. Which mostly of what i see is total nonsense, by people who are not CFTe accredited, who have never worked for a fund, who have never traded FX or stocks and are basically dumb money lambs for the slaughter.  
This money I called retail noise. It is like a layer of mud that flys around the market. Like how a trucks tyres spins after off roading in deep mud. You dont know where it will fly, but it will fly off.  
So the retail noise right now is scared. Thing is fundementally nothing changed. We still need to transfer money for cheap across the world, and people want an alternative to fiat. its just bobby says its crashing right now and everyone is throwing up in their shoes.   
BUT...  
Your dollar will keep becoming worthless.  
You will need money.  
Things will fuck up, in the big picture - that make you want an alternative again.   
Gold will still be gold.  
For this reasons people will want to buy bitcoin again at some point. When people actually want to buy the retail noise gets sucked up pretty fast. Most is margin nonsense spoof orders that a few hundred 'day traders' run after as indicators flash and go bleep buy no sell no buy now ohh i dont know just go all in and margin call why dont you..  
So with all that crap going on, we see al this nonsense price moves but actual new coins from the mine are not distributed.  
By the time we reach the higher difficulty and its harder to get, more people know about bitcoin. Retail noise is as loud as a superbowl crowd cheering and the cost of production will be much higher. So market will be only find new coins distributed at the price the miners want to sell at.  
If it popular, hard to find a new coin and getting more scarce everyday. People will pay more. And that's about it.  
Can't happen with gold tho, too many factors. Someone always finds some more or they prefer to buy a growth stock. This in theory should not happen with BTC because of the fungible and technical aspect.   
Could happen with BTC also though, but only if everyone quits.

Moon bros and lambos are a common meme in this space - you will figure out when you been here longer
Going long aka longing a stock = buying and holding
There is always downside risk and you will feel it one day and realise what i am saying but until then of course you are right and your investment makes sense

They just can move to use spread betting if they wish to avoid capital gains tax, all spread betting in uk is tax free that is why after you fill ISA and allowance up you can just move to spread bets. Very few traders will use up the £20k allowance + income allowance of £12k, if they do can just move into spread betting positions and not sell their crypto to fiat to avoid paying gains. Additionally they could use other currencies outside of the british pound. So really not a big deal to be honest...
