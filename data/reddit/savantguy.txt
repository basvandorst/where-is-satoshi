This is just a natural ignorance curve. It takes a lot of time for a paradigm shift to happen in belief systems. You will get violent irrational responses. Thats how you know they can't compete with you using reason or logic.

please upvote this thread and I was really hoping to advertise on here.

yes its for paid ads. It wasn't spammy. I tried just putting the title "Bitcoinslots.co - Bitcoin Casino Slots" for the ad title and it was rejected. Again this is *after* emailing the editor who rejected the ad. I start to think there is some collusion going on here or just selective enforcement.

I absolutely despise paypal. They are way too nosy, disrupt your business, and they steal from you without recourse. THe sooner they are put out of business or have legitimate competition the better.

oops meant to say progressive jackpot.

yes I paid for the ad, emailed krispykrackers and said it was denied due to it being a gambling ad. I have repeatedly seen ads for gambling sites and now I am not getting a response from krispykrackers. Its seriously pissing me off and should be dealt with.
