The 1MB restriction was a coordinated attack, a very vicious one.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:11:34
Try it for yourself and you'll see how practical it is compared to bitcoin Core
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:07:00
Good luck spamming 8mb blocks
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:07:56
Possibly the cringiest example you gave here.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:47:27
You're gonna get attacked.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:57:35
Says mr. nice(cum)(poop)us.
Seems like someone is into scatophilia.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:50:08
Unsupported claim. Provide evidence or simply gtfo.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:05:32
BCH already fulfills that need.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:47:57
Please point out any altcoins that has a greater network effect than BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:52:28
Care to elaborate on how exactly BCH is a scam ?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:48:15
Politics and emotions aside, you should never lump all your eggs in one basket.
Keep your BCH as hedge against BTC

Read my post again.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:42:07
Your post is almost as cringy as a 5 year old twerking on Musical.ly.
I'm impressed.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:44:23
It's almost unbelievable how much you folks are in denial. Overwhelming and irrefutable evidence has shown that a restriction on block size can significantly hinder Bitcoin's adoption and yet you're still blind to this.
It's honestly crazy.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:41:10
Sell now folks, it's about to take a hit.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:28:21
It is a fact that many altcoins lack the network effect that BCH has. It is also a fact that many altcoins are no where near at being massively adopted despite fast confirmations and low transactions.
Your argument is therefore invalid.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:53:45
Ver made me do it. Blame it on him.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:21:51
He was being sarcastic.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:46:35
I would surely change my mind if strong and irrefutable evidence is given, otherwise I won't take you seriously.
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:55:01
This guy has a point though.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:19:38
Sell now.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:19:59
Chill out and just pay crazy fees.
Everything is good... relax.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:02:00
" fairly fast and inexpensive ".
Mate, have you been living under a rock ?
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:18:18
I cringed so hard.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:09:56
Who the fuck cares about him, I'm in for the tech?
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:38:53
it's coming soon™
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:47:38
" I actually manipulate markets for work '' followed by " I don't know how they are doing it ".
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:49:06
At this point, me taking a steamy dump before sleeping is an attack too.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:47:51
Not quite.
Pseudo collision attacks have already been successfully tested on a 52-steps reduced SHA256 , that leaves us 12 steps to be found in order to build a malicious SHA256. At this rate, It wouldn't be beyond the reach of a large corporation or intelligence agency to craft a SHA-256 collision, if it really wanted to. Lets not forget that SHA1 was broken a few years ago while performing 2^80 in comparison to SHA256's 2^128 complexity, so assuming Moore's law computational improvements I wouldn't be surprised if SHA256 happens to be broken in the near future.
Oh and by the way, SHA256's hash function is susceptible to length extension attack.
So yeah...
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:56:43
At this point, me taking a dump before sleeping is also an attack too.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:21:29
Bunch of 5 weeks reddit accounts claiming they've been around since 5$ and giving advice as if they knew exactly what the outcome would be.
The cringe is real.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:57:17
This is exactly why I left this sub
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:01:08
ZeuS botnets overloading the server with massive amounts of requests. DDOSing at its finest.
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:00:21
I cringed so badly. Help.
