Bitcoin was on Sourceforge for years before Github…

There was no Bitcoin repository on Github in 2009; it was on sourceforge.

Are SegWit addresses as secure as regular addresses? What type of reverse engineering has been attempt on SegWit addresses? Is it easier to crack a private key given a SegWit address and public key?
@_date: 2017-08-21 06:39:16
Yes so fast.

There is no incentive for miners to include SegWit transactions into blocks before the 2x hardfork has happened. It guarantees Core must go with 2x regardless of their opinion and is very smart of the miners to covertly organize this effort to ensure fairness in the scaling of Bitcoin. :-)

1MB block limit will be legacy by end of November.

Blockchain storage is a rare commodity. Your shitcoin doesn't store shit in a blockchain, instead on cheap and unsecured disk. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 04:24:47
2x is already long agreed upon by 100% of all miners. You get 2x as the NYC agreement states. This is all out of the control of the "coders"... big money running the show....
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:19:18
Sent $47,500 USD and it cost only 9 bucks for 1 confirmation (next block). Bitcoin is horrible for micro transactions. Good for big money. ��
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:09:19
1 Megabyte is 1,048,576 Bytes. There has been no 1 MB blocks mined. ��

LN isn’t Bitcoin; it’s a payment network and it’s still not even close to being complete. As it stands you can lose tons of BTC using it... Come back in 2-3 years...

Looks like LN screws Satoshi Nakamoto since his coins are secured under P2PKH...
@_date: 2018-03-17 04:32:16
Another Wallstreet Bitcoin lie. Ugh
@_date: 2018-03-17 04:50:33
LN isn’t Bitcoin; on-chain is Bitcoin.

LN isn’t Bitcoin. Satoshi cannot use it because they blocked his coins secured under P2PKH.

Gavin is incompetent; he ran Satoshi off by going to the CIA. He has no credibility left.

He never said this. I watched his one hour lecture and he says NOT to invest into Bitcoin. Get the facts straight. That said; invest into Bitcoin. ✌️
@_date: 2017-09-09 22:46:20
It's not a debate. It's a scare tactic to raise the price. Both sides are full of BS and you have been brainwashed:

The story is full of holes. Under no circumstances must a person unlock their phone for a government employee. This can only be forced by a court order and most of the time that will not work (Ref Apple Inc).
Never comply with a government employee without your attorney present.

Samsung will be flooding the market with Sha256d chips in Q3 of this year which will end Bitmain’s dominance and bring back mining decentralization.

LN isn’t Bitcoin; I will always use on-chain because I only store wealth or make large (&gt; 100 USD) payments. I can buy coffee with fiat.

Fuck Coinbase; they will not survive.

Every 3.5 years we have a batch of early adopters that cash out and leave (go live life) and the late adopters come in and bag hold for 3.5 years. It is like clockwork...
@_date: 2017-09-05 06:44:55
They spammed to fake the need for a blocksize increase. Go look at the mempool since the fork. BTC is almost free relay. �� Highly,unlikely you will see a 100K Tx mempool backlog again because they don't have anything to justify now they have their Altcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-09 22:43:54
Who cares about BCH. Please stop promoting it.
@_date: 2017-09-09 22:41:15
Now we just need the 2x portion to see some 2MB blocks without SegWit signature stripping to see which fits the most TX's. Interesting times ahead, cannot wait to dump the 1x coin and buy another house like with BCH. �� Free money printing ��

I synced the entire blockchain in 5 hours. Your internet must be slow. The verification process is not a bottleneck (your cpu proves this).

For one, Bitstamp is used for BitPay's processor liquidation so the 5K profit takers tanked BitStamp through BitPay. I'm not sure Kraken or GDAX are a liquidation point for anyone.

It means more HODLing.

Cannabis prices are tanking; it will continue until it is as cheap as tobacco.  California and Colorado are having to export the “excess”. 2 more years and it will be legal nationwide and cheap because people will just grow it themselves. Supply and demand is real...

If these people go and buy Bitcoin and it crashes that shirt alone is legal grounds for suing you because you are advertising it. Did you talk to your attorney about promoting Bitcoin by wearing a t-shirt? This is not a joke. Frivolous lawsuits are most popular now than ever. ��
