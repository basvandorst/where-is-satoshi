I don't know what to tell you except that on the umpteenth, tearful try, my wallet recovery phrase that I had been putting in correctly as well as repeatedly worked.  
I've no doubt people are going to shout that I must've been reading or typing the phrase incorrectly, but I wasn't.  
I don't know who you can ask for help, but I hope you get it.  
@_date: 2016-12-26 02:30:32
Sure, you do that.
@_date: 2016-11-03 14:21:46
Thank you. I just did all of this. I don't mind leaving some money in coinbase and using coinbase to buy more bitcoin, but I'd rather not have all my bitcoin in one basket.

My bitcoin have disappeared from CoPay.  Who do I contact there?  I can't find a customer service email or number.

How do i make a paper bitcoin wallet?

Thank you, account recovered thanks to the helpful people here! 
@_date: 2018-06-02 14:29:34
Okay, are you from the US? If so, doesnt this mean you have to pay capital gains tax on the bitcoin you spend?
@_date: 2018-06-05 18:28:33
That poor sloth.
@_date: 2016-12-26 02:30:54
No I won't delete it. There must be others who got confused like I did.

Thank you!

Okay, now I'm worried.  I can't find a support email or number for copay, and my money has disappeared.  
@_date: 2016-12-25 23:01:04
Thanks!  It worked!!!  I'm so relieved!  
@_date: 2018-06-02 16:14:50
Do you get taxed on Bitcoin sales in your country?
@_date: 2016-12-25 23:15:48
Now that I know what to do, I'll do it first, thanks.
@_date: 2017-09-18 21:30:22
No, it was correct. I have used it before and I checked what I typed each time. This afternoon, it worked, finally, whatever the reason, and I transferred the bitcoin out. I won't use Copay again.
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:58:33
Thanks!  Whatever the reason, since this is my second big scare with CoPay, I've decided not to use it anymore.  If it's my error, then CoPay doesn't suit me.
@_date: 2017-09-18 03:38:19
Could someone please help me with this problem? is there someone I can talk to at Copay about it?

How do I get my bitcoin out of coin base and into something safer? Can you link me some steps?
