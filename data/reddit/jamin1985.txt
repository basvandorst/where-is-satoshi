We need to find a voice for the bitcoin community. A lot of what I know already is from bitcoin.org and reddit.

I am not technical, I want to know more about bitcoin as a community. How it functions, how it grows, and why I should give it a chance.
Is there no one passionately talking about this kind of thing?

Google is a giant and their name can get mainstream customers to adopt Bitcoins. The only issue is that  McDonald's would need to be able to account for Bitcoins as seamlessly as they do cash. And what about refunds ... forking over cash is not prudent because of exchange risks. The accounting rules need to catch up with technology.

How do you account for the volatility in the bitcoin/USD rate?

I guess what I am asking is how do I meet someone else from around the world using bitcoin?
And can I play him in a game of chess for BTC?

I think BTC needs open exchange to reduce volatility, if everyone took your attitude and no one used bitcoins than they are effectively worthless.
Vendors wouldn't be joining certainly, exchanges would not exist, the whole thing goes up in flames.
For instance I am working an app to make BTC more social with an anonymous veil.
