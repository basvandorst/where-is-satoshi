LOL, there will be lots of cool ideas going into this but still wish to keep playable for families too.. the image shown is not the real image for the game , that is currently being worked on. 
As for an online bitcoin monopoly game, this looks like it could be our next step :)

The player pieces will be a mining tool, a physical bitcoin, a pizza slice would be a cool idea also :), you can see the list on of pieces on the the crowdfund webpage. 
lots of different companies create these games in bulk amounts. to my recollection it is ok to make your own as long as it is not just called "monopoly"
I could open a pizza shop and call it PIZZA HUT but in small print beside the big print have "this is not a" and its legal  :)

no this is for bitcoin playing cards made by the same company as the kickstarter project, our next goal is a limited edition pack made using the technology used by MPC in the kickstarter campaign

The screen shot is just mock up, the actual board game will be completely different to this shot. we must change all aspects of the game to ensure no copywrite rules are broken. this will have a tonne of cool features included, it will be a very fun game for all. There have been many copies of monopoly boardgames and i have reserched on this too. I will seek a lawyer if need be :)
