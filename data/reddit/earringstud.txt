@_date: 2018-01-15 17:18:48
Whats a more efficient way?
@_date: 2018-01-25 07:25:52
Great LINK! UPVOTE THAT GUYS!! HE JUST GAVE US EXCELLENT INFO!
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:47:42
Thank you, Yes. That is exactly what I read. But how do we know that btcdrak is really behind it? Did you see any information from btcdrak himself?  
I really want to order a few but I just cant push myself to click the button lol
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:41:39
I have many GPU rigs. Honestly I really like love the hardware and the plug and play aspect of the ASIC miners compared to building out full rigs. Allot of diagnostic times goes into the GPU rigs.
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:57:03
I am just trying to make the videos as I go through my own trials and tribulations. This info is just to help man.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:13:57
I agree! Talking about the speculation. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 12:50:38
yes but higher fees?
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:15:29
There ya go!!!
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:23:11
Yes but it will take till 2140 till all coins are mined!
this video explains bitcoin briefly.
But right now is the time to mine for sure!
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:56:04
I believe that we need to think about the main player. If we look at history it can teach us a few things! ��

That’s not bad but I feel like the cooler worked better at suppressing the sound, I don’t know about the temps... but very interesting!
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:07:59
I know I agree, but we must ask for what reason? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:06:25
I am new to reddit and I’m trying to understand what I’m doing wrong. I have never posted one topic ever about this and you said this was removed for high volume theme? Please explain.
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:59:12
Its not really that it limits you, Its about the mining difficulty rate. For instance back in November 2017 you could mine .8 coins in a year at that difficulty rate, now fast forward to today you can only mine .6 coins a year due to the difficultly rate. This is the same for gpu and asics.
@_date: 2018-01-23 03:50:16
I know right ! 
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:27:58
Understood and justified. I am really trying to spread free info , no ads. I feel like the point of this is to decentralize and equalize and allot of the sites and info seem to be doing the opposite.
I’ll keep
My gears spinning and hopefully I can implement something amazing.
Thanks again!
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:27:38
is bitcoin cash mining still profitable 2018? Should you mine bitcoin or mine bitcoin cash in 2018?
is mining bitcoin cash bch bcc more profitable to mine bitcoin mine bitcoincash bitcoin cash 2018? Bitcoin cash mining with your antminer is more profitable right now than mining bitcoin with your hardware.
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:48:13
I have 3 coming, should I vent it or try a duct fan? 
Does anyone know how hot these run??
THANKS GUYS!!!
@_date: 2018-01-07 12:22:50
good idea!
ONly 2 fans?
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:07:30
Yes agreed but that is not wise investments on their parts. You cannot go all in and say oh it’s the market fault, no it’s your. 
We must stay diligent!
@_date: 2018-01-15 11:37:20
Sorry that was the statement from twitter. Follow them on twitter and they will announce release dates.
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:45:23
Agreed, I stand in the same place you do.
@_date: 2018-01-16 00:50:23
Awesome input bro! Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:38:35
sorry about that
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:21:29
Thank you I appreciate that. Don’t be sorry. Asking for honesty.  Any topics that would be a cool idea to get my gears rolling ?
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:02:34
Hi guys,
I am sharing this information with you because I am going through the trials and errors so I want to share to try to save you time. I know most of you know this information but allot of us dont. I am not promoting antpool in anyway at all! That was just the first pool I used to setup the miners. I am using a different pool but I dont want to even say because I dont want you to think that I am promoting one thing over another. This is simply information on how to navigate our GUI interface on the antminers. I remember before I got the antminer I was clueless how to access the interface or even if I had to hook it up to the monitor! Well any how I hope this helps you guys and if does not please add more help for anyone that needs it in the comments. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:11:01
Yes but people are scared. We have to remember this is a very volatile market. I think holding the machines making your initial investment back is the right move with this antminer s9
@_date: 2018-01-07 02:31:49
Awesome! Add 1400W ?
How would you go about doing a liquid cooled system?
Thanks so much guys!!
@_date: 2018-01-04 04:47:39
@_date: 2018-01-06 12:38:03
for you sir, a suit next time!
@_date: 2018-01-15 11:49:38
I know its crazy! this s9 bitcoin miners from bitmain are so hard to get now its ridiculous

@_date: 2018-10-21 20:51:49
Great info! Thank you I appreciate it! 
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:34:50
They said them self’s that funds were SENT internally. WtF do you call that? Lol a phishing scheme? I don’t think so. People would have to login to be phished. This was INTERNAL trading. Hey spin it or call it what you want , all that I am trying to describe is how I made money of the market in that time. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 11:26:26
It was they even said them self’s lol ... go read their official statement.. ur spreading FUD
@_date: 2018-03-09 17:54:15
So what do you call it when someone inside of the platform sent money to different accounts ?
@_date: 2018-03-09 00:10:53
Prob me 
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:27:27
Okay I will check now , thank you.
@_date: 2018-03-08 13:55:49
Any thoughts ?
@_date: 2018-02-10 01:46:23
wise words I also agree with that! hmmm but even if we scale this to a true WORLDWIDE currency, I think that is hard to imagine how many transactions worldwide having every moment.
@_date: 2018-02-10 14:51:23
I bet they did
@_date: 2018-02-10 02:17:01
I think there will be no issue.
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:42:30
But it was hacked. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 18:20:43
Hahahaha u fucking idiot just got tried.

@_date: 2018-03-26 17:28:03
Agh okay thank you for clearing it up!
@_date: 2018-02-10 02:17:17
No question!
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:56:34
Did you see the new video of them preparing for shipping of multiple units? Not saying they are real or not real, just going over the facts... forget about the spam token whitepaper crap
@_date: 2018-03-09 19:04:21
The only troll here is your face my friend Hahahaha ... hangover from too much water? Are you not like 15?
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:57:53
What do you think would be the best insulation for the antminer s9 cooler build out?
@_date: 2018-03-06 01:15:14
Thank you
@_date: 2018-02-10 01:48:11
See that is exactly what I am saying.
@_date: 2018-02-19 22:45:55
Did you look at Miners Ones whitepaper? 
@_date: 2018-02-14 06:44:19
your a good man you, lol... Have a good night!
@_date: 2018-03-30 07:56:22

Honestly stop speaking or typing.
Every time you write something and I have to read it I get stupider ☹️
@_date: 2018-03-09 00:50:08
Thank you I really appreciate that, I agree 100% and thank you for the positive comments , I really appreciate it.
@_date: 2018-03-08 05:22:44
Crazy 
@_date: 2018-02-08 12:18:24

@_date: 2018-02-14 06:37:38

@_date: 2018-02-09 23:10:18
I have a question for all of you. What would you do if you saw this, had tons of cash and are scared if bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:42:12
Honest reply 
@_date: 2018-03-09 18:49:48

@_date: 2018-02-10 01:33:56
Thats amazing, how do you regulate the value? Do you sell right away? or HODL?!?!?
@_date: 2018-02-14 06:17:06
The bottle was free. I am good friends with the GM and staff. But yea those bottles are crazy expensive I think are comp tab was up to 50k but yah it was fun!
@_date: 2018-02-10 01:47:31
Yes I think Bcash is great but I am talking about bitcoin lol
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:26:04
Crypto ads or any crypto content, that is what I heard... am I mis informed?
@_date: 2018-02-10 01:35:28
yes I understand but will lightning really be able to do it? I agree about the fundamental aspect.
@_date: 2018-02-10 02:16:30
No doubt 
@_date: 2018-02-08 12:20:30
Capacity is showing its issues. Scale this in 1 year.
@_date: 2018-02-10 02:22:54
Okay but honestly from a worldwide perspective, of this was adapted as a “true” currency like the other fiat crap not that bitcoin is... but worldwide transactions happening in the moment ? I think
We can handle it but I am just curious what you guys think 
@_date: 2018-02-14 06:30:50
lol my rank went down like 3 points but who cares! Life should be serious all the time! You must have fun you do! =)
@_date: 2018-03-07 20:27:53
Lol you are awesome 
@_date: 2018-02-16 16:51:45

@_date: 2018-02-11 11:40:20

@_date: 2018-03-09 18:15:26
Honestly WTF IS WRONG WITH U PEOPLE SMFH
Here bro .
Official statement form your man himself;
UPDATE: “All deposit, trading and withdrawal are resumed.” Note that Changpeng Zhao refers to ‘hackers’ in this statement from his Twitter account.
“Binance has reversed all irregular trades. All deposit, trading and withdrawal are resumed. will write a more detailed account of what happened shortly. Interestingly, the hackers lost coins during this attempt. We will donate this to Binance Charity.”
Here is the link:
NOW STOP SPREADING FUD 
@_date: 2018-02-10 14:51:05
I agree but I just feel like something special maybe Im just excited lol 
@_date: 2018-04-01 05:27:08
Oh I am very aware of it lol This post will be muted very soon but once its posted on youtube there is nothing they can do!
@_date: 2018-04-01 05:25:44
I made a promise to my source, next Friday I am allowed to post all the information, snap shots, emails and BTC confirmed BLOCKCHAIN payments from bitmain to cobra... That should give you just a tiny insight. They are fucked.
@_date: 2018-04-08 20:38:56
Go take a look. Just like he said Halong is a scam? What’s next? Also he had BTC wallet address pinned to top of his profile? You seem very intelligent if you can’t add. You are prob cobra or his friend. Good luck in life 
@_date: 2018-04-01 05:30:20
100% guarantee this will be marked as FUD by morning, just giving me more credibility... If they have nothing to hide they will keep this post up till Friday morning so I can out these mother fuckers... And all you who support them can cry yourself a river. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 05:28:12
Perfect, I will accept that. Lets see how quickly the mod takes this down. If he has nothing to hide let him keep it up and I will post the info right here buddy.
@_date: 2018-04-01 05:19:29
Next week I am releasing all the info man. They are taking huge kickbacks , this is going to shake the community.
