Well I had nothing constructive to add to the first point. Yes the price volatility changes the price even from second to second. Thats widely known.
I was just adding to your post that you dont have to pay a fee every time and that there is an alternative way to use coinbase without fee since thats not very well known at all unless you have experience with GDAX or Coinbase Pro which your typical user has probably never used or even heard of.
Just kinda as a just incase someone reads your post then discovers coinbase and were to shy away from it thinking all of it has fees when it all doesn't.

If you transfer your coins to pro.coinbase formerly known as GDAX you can set limit as post only and sell your coins for cash $0.01 above market value and with no fee. But only if the price rises that 0.01. Pro does a taker and maker model its quite cool.

You are safer to use hardware wallets yes but you maid claims that 2FA meant something it totally does not. Phones are the least secure form of 2FA. I called you out on your misunderstanding of what 2FA is. I agreed with the stuff you said that was right. And heres a secret, well not really secret, anyone can deploy there own blockchain since it's open source.

I assume you don't fully understand how bitcoin works. Your coins are actually stored on the blockchain and devices such as trezor or ledger do not actually store the coins on them. Instead they store your private keys on them which are used to sign transactions without the risk of exposing your keys to an infected computer. To use your hardware wallets like trezor or ledger you have to have a computer or web wallet anyways. All that 2FA stands for is 2 factor authentication meaning 2 proof's. So if you have a password on your wallet + a ledger that means you have 2FA. I know for sure Trezor does, and I presume that ledger does was well have built in U2F into them. So when I go to login to facebook, or github for example I can use my trezor in combination with my password to login but I need both at the same time compromising just 1 will not give you access.

Normally with a bitcoin wallet you have a public key and a private key and you use the private key to send your coins. You can encrypt this on your computer but it can be stolen. So you use a hardware wallet, one such as a trezor is a U2F device already. Now you have your passphrase on your wallet, and your trezor for your private key. But not only this but some wallets allow for multi-sig to be requires so you have to authorize it but then so does an entirely separate human being.

You can buy coins off other people or eBay but beware of scammers there is no recourse on eBay if someone wants to scam you because it's not covered. If you are only trying to obtain small novelty amounts of coins you may be interested in checking out [coinpot.io]( where you can get free coins but in very tiny amounts or you could use other "faucets" to get free coins. Those are websites that use ad's usually from mellow ads on their website then hand out free coins so they can get page impressions for their ads. They generate more then they give out, you won't get rich but it has less investment risk then actually converting your us dollars into coins since they are entirely free.

When you put it like that you are right. Going from $1 to $3,000 is a 3,000x increase where-as from $3,000 to $1,000,000 is only a 333x increase.
