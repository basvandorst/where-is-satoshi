I cancelled my order as soon as it started to shoot back up and got some at 18,480.
I don't know what to expect I just try and get myself a big discount and see if the dip goes there, ... that's worked a bunch of times. It also might not and it might never drop that far.

I like Gemini. It took 1 day to get verified, but when I deposit money via ach, I can coins right away. It takes 4-5 days for the deposit to completely clear,  and btc usually doubles in that time (jk (not really)).
I started coinbase account, bought $250 with visa cc and account got locked for three weeks, just got access back. Support took 5 days to respond each time. 
I did abra app, took 2 or 3 days to verify, but I cannot add a credit card in order to buy. I have tried 4 different amex cards  (charge and credit) and cannot buy with abra. I asked support why it doesn't work, 5 days later they respond and tell me it doesn't work. 
Gemini has been down a couple times when i wanted to trade, but I shouldn't be trading anyway, amiright?

You only make profit when you sell, you cannot make profit while the btc is on your ledger nano s.
You can store the btc on your ledger nano s, and the price of btc will rise and fall on exchanges around the world while you are hodling your btc on your ledger nano s.  when you are ready to take profit, you can send btc from ledger nano s to an exchange, and get $USD.

just like any other income, this is kind of how it goes, 
i sell 150 bucks worth of stuff at a garage sale and take cash and don't report it as income, because you don't really have to, it's under $600, and it's not a normal income source, it's a one or twice or more than that is now you're a reseller, but once or twice for a few hundred is nbd.
if you open a bank account for a $100 bonus, you gotta pay taxes on that for sure.  the bank will issue you a 1099-int, and may or may not report it to the irs, but you gotta add that to your income.  gotta do that one, for sure.  yeah, it's only a hundred bucks, and you only do it once every couple years, but interest income is reported and you gotta pay.
if you buy $100 worth of bitcoin at some local meetup for cash, and later sell it back to another anonymous person for a cash transaction, that transaction, if it is your ONLY cash-btc-cash transaction for the year, ....  yeah you gotta pay, but not really.  that transaction is not gonna get reported to the irs, ...   i mean, unless you buy it from the irs or something weird or you tinfoil hat honeypot i dunno....  you aren't gonna need to pay for that.
if you buy a couple thousand in btc from an exchange for funds from your bank or card, and later sell them on an exchange, then yeah you have to calculate every cent of your profit and pay taxes on that because it "may or may not" get reported (which means that it "may" get reported, so you should list it on your taxes weather or not you get a 1099 or whatever for those sales) so you have to report it, and you gotta pay.
i'm not an accountant, or a tax specialist, but these should be taken as common sense ideas that help you decide how you should treat your income during tax time.
