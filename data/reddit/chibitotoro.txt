Sure, send 'em my way!

You're not even being rational.

Honestly I know you mean well, but this kind of reply always sucks.  OP stated up front that he is non-technical.  Open source communities that brush off complaints by saying "why don't you do something then" are really toxic to user engagement.  Even if he sat down and spent hundreds of hours learning it, what is the likelihood his first commits are going to be merged?
Its better to acknowledge that there is a user issue here and make an effort to engage, educate and find a path forward rather than brushing off and saying "less complaining more coding".  There are very few people who could actually do that.

I'm not for or against this necessarily, but calling it "Ultimate" significantly reduces your message, and credibility.

Your second statement is incorrect.  Metals, real estate, livestock and many other assets store value, and yet you cannot buy things with them in the sense that you are talking about.

Huh.  Just like, say, a piece of paper with an old politician's picture on it?

Your assertion that there is no point in running a node if it's not at the latest version seems to be holding you back.
Extrapolate your argument to every other piece of software you've ever used.  Do you religiously update it all the time?
It took over ten years to get people to stop using IE6.  Software has inertia.  Updating a working system takes time and effort and requires downtime. Unless there is a huge value proposition in doing an update, its not at the top of most people's to-do list.
Your implication corollary is that if you don't upgrade, then you aren't a true enthusiast.  Which is simply a dangerous and unproductive statement.

I didn't even realize something like this was even possible with Bitcoin.  I guess I have more to learn about how it works.  Thanks for this info.

"Android gamers"
Seems like an oxymoron.  Also, doesn't appear to be limited to games.

That was damn painful to read.  Might as well name it, marry it and get a room with it.

You're a joke of a journalist.  There is no professionalism to be found anywhere.  Try actually researching instead of just chatting to your buddy Craig and trying to report what he says as fact.

You _can_ put a price on security... in this case €149, plus whatever you do to keep your seed backup safe.  
As to the false dichotomy, there are significantly more options.  You can make a choice, and buy more coins with the savings :)

The price seems extremely excessive.  Model 1 is €89 and this model is going to go for €149 (or higher)?  It's highly unclear what the advantages even are, and this is pushing almost 3x the price of the Nano...
Open source &gt; closed source, but the asking price for this is not justifiable IMO.

So much this.  Wallets are the major issue contribution to the perception of high fees.
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:30:13
What makes your prediction of fair value better than OP's?
Honestly I'm with OP.  It's criminally undervalued at $25,000.   I feel fair value is around $600k.

Anyone paying dollars for fees is using the wrong wallet.  All my latest transactions have been for 10 cents or less and mined into the next block every time.
If your wallet is still suggesting 200+ satoshis per byte, you need to override the fee or ditch the wallet.

You must be new here.  Welcome !

I'm forced to use it at work, not personally.  Its so bad at everything - spam filtering, calendar scheduling, email search... it's all a joke compared to modern services ��
@_date: 2019-05-02 00:17:08
Gonna go ahead and disagree.  I'll go as far as saying it is the worst possible email experience you can have in 2019.  I prefer Yahoo even... at least they attempt to control spam.
