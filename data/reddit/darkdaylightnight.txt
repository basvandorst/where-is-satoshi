Ironically, if you'd research the tulips vs Bitcoin argument, which is all over the Internet, you'd understand exactly why I haven't bothered to explain and hence I call you a moron.

If I was in such a position, I wouldn't dump in one trade. I'd trickle, as not to affect for other hodlers. Duh.

How big is your penis? Three fiddy buttcoins.

Yeah, family first. It was such an emotion moment watching my order fill. I said I'd not part with my coin until zero, funny how priorities change and I learnt to love what I have rather than money I could potentially gain.
I needed to hear I'd done the right thing, for me, thanks.

Throwaway acct, not trolling. Also fuck Roger v and the twats that way. 
Bois.  Yesterday I sold my coin.  I have held since 2011/2012 and have ridden this bitch like I was an Olympic surfer.
However. I now have a child, took a two year employment gap and have had some fun along the way.
I was 100% BTC and living from my stash. It was stressful these last few months, as I was foolish and hodl, just to watch my stash diplenish. 
I finally cracked and had a weak hand moment. I sold at a big overall gain, but no where near what I could have sold at ATH (same old story.) 
I do plan to buy back in, but I am waiting for the saucy dip. I don't have the magic 8 ball, no one here does, however, having traded actively over these years and educated myself to live off an asset that was very volatile, I strongly believe we aren't at the bottom.
Ironically the price pumped immediately as and when I sold.
Moral of the story.  Hodl does work, if you time it right. Trading is hella fun but hella risky, I've lost and won. Greed and hope, optimism can only carry you so far.
In hindsight I should have sold at ATH, I had my sell orders set but I believed it was moon time, not dumpy monthly.
Anyway, stop worrying, if you're fucked and have lost your money, I do suggest you hodl, as it SHOULD rise again.  On the other hand, don't be like me and be a fool parted with his magic Internet money.
