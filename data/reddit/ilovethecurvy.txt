the same way as what happens now. its obviously working. The only things needing to change are that the government cant borrow money, and the government issues the money not the banks. If the government can issue treasury bonds and that has value, why cant it just issue the currency directly?

and you think the central banks and their minions are just going to lie down and spread cheek? your naive, little man. What hard evidence do you have?

"Bitcoin isn't a currency. It's a commodity. A currency needs a relatively stable value to function as a medium of exchange. If it goes up too much, everyone will hoard it. If it goes down too much, nobody will want it. In 2013, Bitcoin's annualized volatility has been 105 percent. That's compared to 5.5 percent for the dollar and 8.5 percent for the euro. Unless the hacker(s) behind it figures out a way to match the supply of Bitcoins with the demand for Bitcoins -- i.e., adding a central bank -- it won't be much more than a curio for people who don't think fiat is a four-letter word.
"That leaves one final question. What kind of commodity is Bitcoin if it's not a currency? Well, it's a technologically-impressive product out to revolutionize the world with absolutely no fundamentals to justify its billion-dollar valuation. It's the ultimate dotcom stock, minus the sock puppet."
So you guys are long term bitcoin collectors? i dont understand, you want to collect a digital value in an imaginary computer universe for its collectors value? i dont get this.

no we would not, the government is issuing the money directly to these state owned fed who is then distributing it to the state owned banks who are operating like the Bank of North Dakota. The money is not created out of debt, there fore it is not a debt money system. [Islamic finance.](

yes it could be 100% reserve bro, its a government owned bank, and if the government creates the money instead of borrowing it, the bank would be 100% reserve. Jeez man have you ever seen

and that makes sense because.....
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:33:17


you dont seem to understand the point im making, the only currency that ultimately matters are ones that you can pay your taxes in. If the government can take your home, your savings, your freedom, if you dont pay your taxes (which i say it has no right to do so under the constitution or under common law) than the only money that ultimately matters is what you can pay your taxes in. If the king says taxes must be paid in gold, then your fucked if you dont have any arent you? You can buy everything in the world with bitcoins but if you cant pay your taxes in it, nobody wants it as a currency. a "legal tender for all debts public and private."
@_date: 2013-04-05 01:09:42
and yet somehow or another im supposed to believe that the bitcoin is a sane, safe, desirable alternative to the Federal Reserve note we call the USD?
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:53:35
yes because a fact aint a fact unless its told by someone who i like and is super nice to me.
@_date: 2013-04-03 18:33:59


thats because the government no longer has the ability to control the amount of money in circulation there fore it is beholden to the interest of the banking industry which has the sole monopoly on the creation of money. "Let me control a nations money supply and i care not what laws she pass"


Your telling me there is no mathematically possible way of creating a formula that would increase the amount of money coined in direct relation to GDP growth? eliminating any sort of worry about "nobody being smart enough of or trustworthy enough to do it. And yes money can originate in the marketplace, i agree with that, its the way it should be, but when the government forces you to pay taxes in the Fed Note, then ultimately that other currency is not viable for the poor to use, as almost all their money goes to food and shelter, they would have no choice but to work for the currency the government demands its taxes be paid in. 


What municipalities allow for you to pay your property taxes in bitcoin? Also again, what about state and federal income tax? if you have to pay that in fed reserve notes, it doesnt make sense to work for bitcoins. 


no argument here. Perhaps you'll like [this]( 
edit: until the government allows you to pay your taxes in bitcoins as well as the Federal Reserve Note, Bitcoin is just a commodity, not a currency. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 17:08:58
soooo essentially you went into debt to buy bitcoins. why cant we have a currency issued by the state without incurring a debt. then develop infrastructure necessary to use it electronically like we do currently with paypall or credit/debit cards online. You can buy shit online without a fee from a 3rd party account. All the technological innovations of bitcoin are cool, and no one is saying its not a novel concept, its just not a practical or even ideal solution to the debt money system we currently all operate under. (except n korea, iran, cuba and ... idk its hard to find too much information on this) 
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:58:44
yeah, because debt free money is soooooo 1530
@_date: 2013-04-03 18:01:56


if they are accountable to the publics vote, they would be thrown out. The government currently gets around this buy borrowing that money, at interest, from the Fed, who gets to create money out of thin air to buy that debt, as china (who used to do the same thing) is no longer interested in buying that debt. Restoring the power to create money into the hands of those accountable to the public is the only solution. Since there is no method of how much bitcoins can be "mined" in correlation with the growth of the economy, economic growth is limited to the rate in which we can "mine" additional credit. its as silly a notion as limiting the growth of an industrial economy to the rate in which a golden rock can be dug out of the earth.
the bitcoin system is just a digital gold standard, with all its inherent flaws. It is a novel concept, and there are plenty of lessons to be learned from the digital ease of use, and if it were limited to national boundries like a US-Bitcoin, and a Euro-bitcoin, and a Yuan-Bitcoin etc etc. then it would serve a good purpose as a complementary currency alongside even the current Fed Note. it would be even better if we fixed that whole mess up and re-established a government issued fiat currency free of debt and also had the ability to 
fuck it, 
if you cant pay your property tax in bitcoins its not a fucking alternative to the debt money system. end of story. if you cant pay your property tax in bitcoins its nothing but an investment and not an alternative to the current debt money system.
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:59:05
ah so then bitcoin is not basically the same thing as gold?
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:30:30


its called  and is that not the case with bitcoins? dont they get progressively harder to mine, thus putting the computational power necessary to mine them significantly out of the reach of most people? 
@_date: 2013-04-03 17:13:52
thats why you have checks in balances. the only thing that threw that out of whack was the bankers temporary victory on the monopoly of the creation of money. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 17:00:47
so how many bitcoins do you have? and did you get them all from mining them or did you have to trade fed notes for them? 
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:30:32

ever hear of the [Bank of North Dakota]( Have every state have a banking system similar, that combined with the system advocated by Bill Still and many others. Then have a state owned central bank that handles the current operations that the Fed has, but the state owned central bank would only deal with the 50 state owned banks like Bank of North Dakota. The Federal Reserve would be allowed to exist alongside this Bank of The United States and it would be allow to continue operating the same way as it does now. Only difference is it wouldnt have a monopoly. See how long it takes before shit changes.
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:16:02
so your still tied into the web. that doesnt seem like a solution to me, it just seems like an added hassle
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:49:35


false. If the government could not borrow money, it would be accountable to the public every 2 years. Money inflating in value to much? throw the bastards out. Deflation stifling economic growth too much? throw the bastards out. 


your wrong. Whatever currencies that are accepted for the payment of taxes would be what the values are priced in.  
for example: 4,100 vs 4,200 tones of timber would be worth 3,000 US-Bitcoins, 3,500 US Treasury Notes, and 3,500,000 Federal Reserve Notes. its not that complicated, your logical reasoning is doing backflips trying to argue why bitcoins would be a preferred sole alternative to a Government issued, debt free, fiat currency. Its not even a complementing currency until the government says you can pay the taxes with it. Its merely a commodity, and its very vulnerable to speculation.
Sovereign nations don't have to borrow their money into existence, yet the U.S has done so since 1913. You cannot "pay down" the National Debt because all of our money is created out of debt. To reduce the debt would be to reduce the national money. The only solution is to do what's been done many times throughout U.S. history, issue debt-free U.S. Notes, instead of Federal Reserve Notes and break free of the debt money system. The problem is the same for every nation on earth, as is the solution. Nations don't have to borrow; nations can create, and as long as they arent allowed to borrow, and the power to create the money is restored to the Congress, they will be forced to live within the countries means, *and* provide for economic growth.

yeah because people in midievil england were capable of devising a money system free of debt and interest to private bankers, but us niggas with rockets and satellites cant do it....
