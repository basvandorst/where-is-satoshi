After implementation of one of available bitcoin payment gateways you should consider a free advertising of bitcoin acceptance by your business. You will need to indicate somehow to your customers that you do, in fact, accept Bitcoin. If you have an online storefront, grab [this]( “Bitcoin Accepted Here” button and paste it conspicuously on your site, ideally beside wherever your PayPal, MasterCard, Visa and whatever buttons you already have are. Also grab similar stickers for your door or cash register. You should also submit your business to [Bitcoin.Travel]( merchants directory to get some free visibility in the bitcoin community.

Thank you for your kind response. Hovewer I have one more question and issue: I am stilll concerned about the fact that Airbnb would need to handle fiat to btc conversion for the hosts during the payout on withdrawal request. That may be a totally different amount of bitcoins than the guest previously paid for the booking (because of the price fluctuations). Doesn't this kind of thing require an MSB license?

There is also [ the first Google Maps-based interactive bitcoin directory. They are in the bitcoin community since 2011.

Another option is to keep the hosts' and trevelers' accounts balances in bitcoins only, but that would be a pain in the ass due to the high price volatility of bitcoin. Hosts are allowed to withdraw funds after a successfull traveler's checkout, so after a month or so (since the time of booking), the price could both go to the moon (benefit for host) or plummet (host's loss).
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:04:06
So having that on mind: What might be the best possible option to implement bitcoin for Airbnb?
What kind of business model would be the best for Airbnb regarding bitcoin acceptance?
I guess that there should be a new Airbnb-like or 9flats-like that would allow it's customers to operate in bitcoins only. I mean bitcoin payments would only be accepted.
Don't you think that the best option for such a business would be to keep the users' balances in bitcoins only?
Users would have to agree that a host (after guest's checkout) will receive an exact amount of bitcoins paid in the time of guest's booking (minus Airbnb fees).
So it would look like this:
Let's say a guest is to pay $60 for an AirBNB stay. That guest has to pay with Bitcoin. If the current exchange rate is $600, then the amount the customer would be asked to pay is 0.1 XBT.
AirBNB's guest services fee is "6% to 12%", plus a 3% transaction fee. So for simplicity, let's say they take 15% in total. Thus AirBNB will owe the host $51 ($60 minus $9 in fees) which equals 0.085 XBT, even if the price would fall down by 10% next week.
So then let's say two weeks later the guest stayed with the host and AirBNB then owes the host for the $51 (0.085 XBT). But it turned out that since the time of booking price plummeted 10%. But it could also go to the moon. I guess that it would be a risky business for hosts.

"The current value of a Bitcoin is about US $10.00. So the current value of the entire Bitcoin money supply is $210,000,000. Since this money was made mostly by having computers perform work that it's not clear anyone wanted done, it's just as unclear whose $210 million this is or what he will do when he realizes it's missing."

According to the Internet and Google "bitFlyer Inc. specializes in Bitcoin marketplace and settlement. The company was founded in 2014 and is based in Tokyo, Japan." Please take note that Bitcoin itself appeared for the first time and was launched as an open-source, peer-to-peer project in 2009. bitFlyer Inc. was founded in 2014, so in my opinion it has no right to claim Bitcoin trademark.

@_date: 2015-03-17 17:06:51
There is an alternative to CoinMap and BitPay directories. You should check [Bitcoin.Travel]( It has an advanced search feature based on custom fields for each category and frequently updated list of brick-and-mortar stores, services, hotels and restaurants. It's been working since 2011 and therefore it is the oldest bitcoin directory that I know.

That should do the trick and convince him. There already many businesses in Cali that accept bitcoins as you can see on the map. If your boss decide to accept bitcoins, he should post his business to this directory. It's free of any charge. It will help to build trust and promote his business.

Yet another directory. There already have been dozens of such websites that are currently outdated and contain a lot of scam.

They advertise heavily and are in the getting started section of WeUseCoins website, so it is visited almost by every bitcoin newbie. Bitcoin.Travel have even advertised in the last issue ( of Bitcoin Magazine. I hope they will keep up with the great work. Bitcoin.Travel programmers have developed a credible and easy to use review engine for the community. They also tend to verify every business listing submitted there. It definitely helps to create a trustworthy review web service for all Bitcoiners worldwide. So far I have never seen any scam website submitted there. For me it's like a Google for bitcoin businesses. A bitcoin search engine. The businesses map is very convenient in usage.

Not the best time to buy bitcoins if you want to get rich fast. The value is going to drop soon. Just look at both these charts and compare them... [BitcoinCharts]( vs. [Bitcoin Google Trends]( The bubble hasn't fully popped yet. It will take weeks or months to happen.
Or it might as well skyrocket if PayPal accepts it. But that is not going to happen anytime soon.
