Some experts say it will reach $100k but who knows.

I know a Government worker in my city who is doing the same thing, he mines 24/7 and the bill is paid by Government lol.

I see... So there is a possibility that Tether is being "printed", without the equivalent 1 USD having went into the markets... Meaning Tether would now be worth WELL under $1 because USD supply is obviously not matching Tether supply (in that scenario)..?
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:23:54
That's some really great advice. Some of the best I've heard in a solid year to be honest. I'm going to really take it seriously and think about it. Thanks a ton!
@_date: 2018-02-10 21:55:56
Agree, it's moronic. 
Bitcoin can be used for criminal purposes just as cash/fiat can, but even if that's true, it doesn't undo all the utility of either of them.

EOS is making so many great moves. It has a good chance of outperforming ETH for sure.
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:50:12
They're not stupid. They realize that by allowing people to use the technology available to them for legitimate purposes, then to tax them, they end up with a net profit. 
Actually reminds me a lot of marijuana legalization. While there may very well be downsides, the government will likely see it as a significant net gain, whether they'll admit it or not. ;)

So, what, Tether chain can be completely manipulated and created out of thin air? I don't know much about it, but I don't really think that's true... 
Yeah, that's a little shady, but again, everyone needs to protect their funds and wait this whole thing out. No point speculating. If something seems shady, get out... 
@_date: 2018-02-09 02:25:49
Well... It's not so much that fees are high... The problem is that when there are more transactions than a block can handle, you end up needing to pay more to jump ahead of the line, and of course it's a race to see who can send their money the fastest, so that's why it ends up being a problem.
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:09:58
Great resource, thanks!
@_date: 2018-02-08 06:40:04
You kind of answered your own question.
No, the whole industry will just re-shape itself! 
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:59:52
I do check out Forbes periodically, and this is one article I did see. Yeah, everyone thinks crypto is taking over, but in my opinion, blockchain is going to be a valuable tool. It does many things we've already been doing for centuries, BETTER. Whether it be Bitcoin, or some other crypto that hasn't arrived yet, this space is here to stay, despite some growing pains now and then.
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:09:27
Glad to hear it! Anyone know if ICO's are still iffy like in U.S.?
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:37:26
Congrats! That one bitcoin may be the key to being a rich man later on. Or heck, at least pretty comfortable. Good on you for getting in now while things are relatively low. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:36:34
Glad to see that many large countries are accepting Bitcoin as at least somewhat legitimate at the end of the day. 
But even still, how can you can BTC anyway? It's like banning the internet or something. It's just not going to work in the long-run regardless.

That's a great tip, I appreciate it. 
Umm... Hope you don't mind me asking, but is there any way for a guy like me, average Joe investor, to gain inside information like you or some others might be able to?
Just curious. :)
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:18:38
Wow, that's pretty crazy... I guess I see why there's some serious FUD nowadays. 
Kind of reminds me of Cryptsy back in the day. I definitely lost a good amount, but nowhere close to that... 
@_date: 2018-02-09 02:38:50
"Will it crash?"
Yes it will, it just did. And it will increase, and crash again. That's kinda the name of the game, isn't it? 
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:59:37
Actually, I think this will very much be true. In these times of FUD, just Hodl!
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:38:13
EOS has a future and is easily a great buy. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:08:54
Those are ETH based wallets though - still great though!
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:24:33
... Are you implying Bernie Madoff was a crook?
Okay in all seriousness, yeah, that's fair. But if something looks shady to someone, get out. It's not like things have totally collapsed. Ultimately, one if responsible for their own funds. If you feel it in your gut, make a change... 
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:08:21
Definitely agree - I'm a fan of metamask and MEW as well
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:08:23
LMAO exactly. You only lose when you sell, especially in this volatile space we're living in nowadays. The sunshine will come, don't worry folks. :)
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:57:20
Stole that kind of money from U.S. customers? Where's your evidence?
I'm not being snarky, I'm actually wondering. It's a big claim, surely you understand. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:27:35
Oh sure. Yeah, I totally get it, and while I do have skin in the game, it's only because I believe in crypto/blockchain on the whole anyway. 
So obviously we know blockchain can be a great transfer of value. It's fast, secure, and... Well, relatively easy. Worlds ahead of traditional banking, can we agree?
But then look at projects that specifically are looking to store data on the blockchain. Records, what have you. Maybe you've heard of Triggers? My understanding is, I guess a firearm would be outfitted with this device, where it would measure things like height, tilts of xyz axes, and so on. This information could then be audited later. Now that's a really specific use case, but think about all the other types of records that can be stored?
Some projects are looking to give specific organizations their own chains, where their own info can be stored. For example, projects like Aion. So you're one person, presumably. So you could actually attach all your major accounts to yourself. So, insurance, medical records, this that and whatever else, all onto one "address", or your own entity on the blockchain. 
Of course that use case is much different from Bitcoin. Much more advanced. But just the way records can be recorded, permissions given for who can view those records. These platforms could make life extremely convenient.

Electrum has always been my go-to Bitcoin light wallet. And to my surprise, there aren't as many people using it as I might have thought. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:45:01
I mean a lot of that is true. We're all looking to make "sikk gainz". Everyone is! :)
In all honesty, I don't think we fully understand all the potential use cases just yet. But on the bright side, incredible projects will come around in the future that will likely utilize those new ideas and use them well. I hope. :)
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:11:24
I suppose it's possible, but the way things have been lately, it's a little hard to believe! 
But hey, you never know in this world. We just don't follow traditional rules around here, so nothing is outside the realm of possibility. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:57:31
See but here's the thing... All the exchanges have had to make tough decisions. Heck, maybe even shady ones. But you have to understand that it's been a struggle to survive, and the bottom line for exchanges is, well, getting people ON the exchange!
I've been using them for quite a while, and haven't had any issues. That may just be my anecdote, but many, many, many others have had a similar positive experience... 
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:41:18
I think that sums it up about right. Most of us have lost some money in these volatile markets. Myself included, no doubt whatsoever. But I don't go and blame the exchanges, or come up with elaborate conspiracy theories or what have you... If one were looking for someone or something to blame, that's not exactly the place to point it at... 
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:29:12
I don't see why it isn't possible long-term, but it's gonna' take serious mass adoption, serious trust in crypto, and a whole bunch of other stuff. But if even 10% of the world bought in, 3-400k BTC is not a big surprise at that point... 
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:21:48
I actually don't disagree, but I will say that BTC in and of itself, did give me a "holy shit, this is going to be huge" moment. But I wasn't actually looking at it from the perspective of blockchain being the next big thing, just that it was going to be a new currency that would shake up the banks and change finance forever. 
Only later did using a public ledger for anything other than finances, even occur to me. And apparently to others too, given the many projects out!
And hey, maybe you're right. Maybe it is all going to come crashing down on our heads. Mostly, I just hope it doesn't! That's about all I can offer. lmao
Either way, I don't know if you're invested, but if you aren't and decide to get in, I hope you can profit. You may just become a true believer! ;)
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:15:18
Mostly I just wonder where BTC will stabilize at for the time being... Could we see it immediately go back to over 10k, 11k, 12k? Or will it hover here for a while? Either way, $7,700 is a pretty good price, considering we saw almost 20k a month and a half ago. :)
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:36:37
Good point. To be honest, I was going to invest in AMD a couple years ago, when they were at like $1.63/share. They're still lagging behind Nvidia in GPU's, but it would have been a nice profit. 
Honestly, even in crypto, I've missed out on a lot of big investments just because of not being aware. And I guess it's that frenzy of trying to make huge gains that's driving the market(s). 
As far as ICO's go, I'm thinking of Plexcoin... They're now under investigation by the SEC. Many are looking for a cash grab, but I think that party is going to be over soon for a lot of the scammy ICO's... 
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:01:00
I don't understand where these grand conspiracies come from. You remind of those people who yell "BIG OIL!!" when they need somebody to blame for something...
