No. They have said they haven't sold any Bitcoin. 
Also, I guess when they do start selling, they are likely to have purchased their Bitcoin from low tax countries (eg Cayman Islands) as they're pretty shrewd.

Can't speak specifically about Americans, but if an Australian (resident for tax purposes) moves to, say Dubai (a low tax rate country) and becomes a resident there for tax purposes, you are deemed to have sold your shares on the date you left Australia.  There is alot more detail around it, but the average person can't just make an asset disappear..... The government makes sure they get what they are owed.

Not sure, to be honest.  A quick google comes up with "it depends".

Assuming you are serious, please just fucking don't.  Even hardened followers of Bitcoin will say that it is speculative and could go down.  Bitcoin is NOT investing, it is speculating at best (and betting, at worst).
You are 16yo.  Invest in your education.  Study hard, work smart (and hard) and get a good job.  Use your $200 to improve your knowledge and pay for the jeepney to work or to help educate yourself and the rest of your family. BTW, $25 a day is what a decent call center worker would earn, or thereabouts.  If you do reasonable at school, learn your English and study hard, there are plenty of call center jobs as a first job.    
Let's imagine for a minute that Bitcoin takes off.  Like really goes well and increases in value 10x. It is now worth $80,000 each.  Even super hopeful optimists would not even expect this in the next 5 years.  Could it happen? Well, anything could happen.  But what is the probability that this would happen?... well not really that probably.  But, lets imagine it does.... Awesome right!  Your $200 you "invest" in 2020 is now worth $2,000 in 2025.
But what if you invested in your future with that $200.  A little can go a long way.  Instead of earning, say P30,000 a month, you study hard, work smart and the you push all of your saving towards helping you succeed in life.  You now earn P50,000 a month.  No, you are not an executive, but you are doing well.  Over a hear, that is P240,000 difference, or about US$4,800 better off over the course of the year.
Now, I am not pretending that the $200 was the cause of this.  But you can certainly see that the big picture is more than just "invest in bitcoin". Bitcoin is not a normal investment - it is speculative, at best.  If you want to invest in stocks on the stockmarket, well that is a whole different skillset you need to explore.  But, again, investing in improving your income is a much smarter move.  Good luck.

No, of course not - it was 12.49% since 2011, see [HERE](
