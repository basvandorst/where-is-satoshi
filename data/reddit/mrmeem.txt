Sure, that's far more likely than the fact that Aaron Russo owes over $2 million in taxes. Er, no wait, it's not.

I'll see your YouTube "credible source" and raise you a response to Aaron Russo's imaginary world (and your wishful thinking from the safety and idealism of your college years) from the New York Times:

The enthusiasm may create some near-term losers (and irritating chatter), but the upside is it generates much-needed publicity for bitcoin. These vocal optimists are the ones putting buzz in the ears of their friends, family, media, and most importantly merchants. Just getting the term “bitcoin” on the radar of non-technical folks is a huge and necessary step in the direction of broad acceptance. 
The publicity also expands the conversation to include opinions and theories outside of the existing echo chamber as to the merits and risks of bitcoin. Each time one of these debates surfaces in the wild and is put to rest, bitcoin strengthens its long-term potential, and we as long term investors/believers benefit immensely.
Just like any new relationship, it’s always the most exciting when you first get involved, and you’re pretty much guaranteed to annoy everyone around you with all that swooning.  But then, through time together, working through highs and lows, and plenty of honest communication, that initial burst of fire settles into a sustainable and nurturing simmer.
All this is good for the long-term viability of the bitcoin community.

Just used Gyft for the first time after reading this post and bought a $20 Amazon GC. Super simple and convenient - awesome example of where the bitcoin commercial community should be!

Great resource thanks! I think this will do nicely for now.

No, it has to do with the credibility of his claims, and thus of yours.

Kudos to you, OP, on your determination and quest for quality. I have run dev teams for two of the largest tech companies in the world, and you're the kind of engineer/tester that makes good products great.
