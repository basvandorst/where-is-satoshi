The better title for this would be "No way blockchain is going to survive folks…" . Bitcoin may not survive or certainly maintain its market cap leadership. Blockchain is here to stay.

I read a lot of skeptics talking about the energy consumption of PoW as a big reason why all of blockchain is unsustainable. Then I read comments about 90% of mining facilities being in areas with hydroelectric power, eliminating any impact on the environment / climate change. Does anyone have some reputable stats on this issue?

The people interested in Bitcoin are akin to Edison's muckers. They see the value of the underlying technology for the immense benefits it can provide to society.  
Do you know what happens behind the scenes when you swipe your debit card at the grocery store? Or when you send someone money on Venmo?  
Blockchain will transform our global financial system and provide innovations we cannot imagine today. The average Joe doesn't have to know the technicalities of how it works to experience the benefit.

First, there's an assertion of value on crypto mining in that statement. Why is a factory producing goods more valuable than mining?
Second, is there any analysis that shows those other arguably more productive activities will be impossible due to energy constraints and the consumption of energy by mining facilities?

You need to read more about blockchain. It is not just a ledger. The underlying technology that enables a decentralized network of consensus and trust is massively innovative.

So is it fair to say you don’t believe the vision of decentralization will be realized at scale? Obviously the idea is a threat to many, but what is to stop it?
