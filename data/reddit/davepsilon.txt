You probably don't want to buy using paypal / credit card as reputable sellers won't use them (due to risk of chargeback).  I suspect Coinbase would be a good solution.  You transfer money directly from your bank account.  In my opinion they are a well funded and professional venture.

yes, it is a bad idea.
Just start listing out potential bad scenarios and the risk to your assets.  You have a lot of single points of failure that lead to a 100% loss.
The fact that you have most of your life savings in bitcoins is another single point of failure.  Also not the best idea unless you are young enough that your future career capital dwarfs your current savings.

it's not a great idea to keep a large portion of your savings in bitcoin.  It is a volatile and risky asset.  It's difficult to see how this investment is the best path to your savings goals.
It is difficult to safely hold bitcoins - pick the wrong company and it could fail.  Store your bitcoins wrong and they could be stolen or become permanently inaccessible.
To make a moderate investment in bitcoins I would try to spread the risk between as many wallet technology baskets as possible.

It is an inherit *flaw* (some might call it a feature) to the centralized system.
So if your fiat is issued by a central authority then can similarly do a back door bail in which is to run a really high inflation rate.  This has happened even more frequently in history than bail-ins.
Bitcoin could do the same thing but would require consensus of the majority of the community not just a central lever.

As one example Trump believes the word of a professional spy turned president for life over Americans whose one job is to keep him informed regarding Russia's previous efforts to influence American elections.  As best I can tell he is doing everything he can to avoid lifting a finger to prevent the Russians from interfering in 2020 elections because he short sightedly thinks they will push votes towards him.  Everyone in America loses when the people's voice and faith in the vote is lessened.  I don't care what Obama would or wouldn't do, I care what a good president would do.  Trump misses the mark quite widely in my view.

Another way to look at it is if you go by [M2 money supply]( for the Turkish Lira between now and a year ago:  
(1) 2018 Lira = (0.74) 2017 Lira
For comparison based on [US M2](
(1) 2018 USD = (0.96) 2017 USD.  
And based on [Bitcoin circulation]( over the past year:
(1) 2018 BTC - (0.96) 2017 BTC
(though it's a stretch to use bitcoin supply to compare with M2)

because of the static inflation rate I would expect the market cap and the price can be substituted fairly freely since price is based on current but also future supply.
What has been interesting to me is that the price time series appears to have a pattern around halving events.  Since there have only been two so far it's a bit too few to claim a deep connection.  But since they are about ~1458 days apart I believe on your chart halvings would be at 3.16 and 3.46 with the next at 3.64

A rather smart company once wrote:
1) Investing is for meeting long-term goals; saving 
is for short-term goals.
2) Broad diversification, with exposure to all parts 
of the stock and bond markets, reduces risk.
3) An investor’s most important decision is 
selecting the mix of assets to be held in 
a portfolio, not selecting the individual 
investments themselves. 
4) Consistently outperforming the financial 
markets is extremely difficult.
5) Minimising cost is vital for long-term 
investment success.
6) Investors should know how each investment 
fits into their plans, and why they own that 
particular asset.
7) Risk has many dimensions and investors should 
weigh ‘shortfall risk’ – the possibility that a 
portfolio will fail to meet longer-term financial 
goals – against ‘market risk’, or the chance that 
returns will fluctuate.
8) Market-timing and performance-chasing are 
losing strategies.
9) An investor should not expect future long-term 
returns to be significantly higher or lower
than long-term historical returns for various 
asset classes and subclasses.
they all seem to be relevant

The interesting thing with bitcoin, and it is a property shared with most cryptocurrencies, is that it is a digital asset that cannot be copied and can be assigned.  That's the new idea created with a blockchain.
Now a typical bank account is a number in a database.  It's a subtle difference but it is an abstract idea that is represented as a computer variable.  Whereas a cryptocurrency is, provided the network continues to exist, a \*\*real\*\* digital asset.
And there is some value on the bitcoin network compared to other networks since so much effort has been spent towards creating a great many and very efficient mining computers.  The security of the network is protected by the sunk cost placed in the miners.  ... So what's the value of that and will the value of mining remain above the cost of electricity to keep it protected indefinitely ... that's the real question.  I can't answer that.  But it's not no value.

Now regarding fungibility.  I am talking about a fundamental property of the bitcoin system - you have global knowledge of all transactions.  This is different than with USD cash (and for that matter USD M2).  
And it stands to reason that this could create a fungibility problem since there are laws that prohibit the possession of property or money that a reasonable person believes was stolen.  Whether this will be a problem or not depends on the norms of behavior for actors within the bitcoin system.  For instance will the courts start establishing jurisprudence that three hops is fine, two hops may be fine, and one hop is not fine (I doubt it will be so clear) then it will settle on a similar level as USD.  But the possibility of a problem is certainly there.  And this is certainly something that should be part of a through discussion of bitcoin's properties as a currency.

A logarithmic scale is the only reasonable choice to fit the past data!

Will it continue until 2024?  You need to come to your own conclusions about that - the chart just extrapolates if you assume the later.

Bitcoin is a digital asset that you can send (assign really) to someone else through the internet for a small fee.  Compared to an internet payment company, like say Paypal, there are two major differences. 
1.  The measurement unit is in bitcoins instead of fiat currency.  
2.  You must trust a decentralized network and the system of fixed rules it uses instead of a central authority.  (ie no buyers protection refunds, but also no check fraud scams)
Due to number 2 Bitcoin can be thought of as more like digital cash or digital gold than a digital credit card.
Bitcoin was the first implementation of this decentralized trust digital asset system, which is known as a blockchain.  You can think of the Bitcoin blockchain as a spreadsheet with account numbers and current bitcoin balances (as well as the history of all transactions).  If you have what are called the private keys for an account number then you can send any bitcoins in that account to any other account number.  You can also always generate a new account (starts at 0 balance)
Bitcoin isn't really about finance.  If that is your interest your time would be better spent learning about other things such as commodity futures, stocks vs. stock deposit receipts, exchange traded funds vs exchange traded notes, active vs. passive mutual funds, etc.

Fiat is useful as a medium of exchange due to the promise to keep to small inflation over yearly time frames.  Note that small deflation would actually work the same for this purpose.  
It is less useful as a store of value for exactly the same reason - that the central issuer promises small inflation.  The loss of value builds up over time.  Some argue that this results in a better society by encouraging capital investment.  But it certainly does present a conundrum for small savers who must take on risk to preserve purchasing power.

Paul Krugman is a nobel prize winning economist famous for writing accessible and mainstream articles in the New York Times and other traditional outlets (as well as more technical treatments in academic outlets)
Many economists, and I'm going to assume Krugman is one of them, view hard money (currency backed by a physical asset) to be anathema to a healthy, growing economy.  The main article doesn't mention this explicitly but I take the closing line " If bitcoin is the future, then progress is in the past. " to mean economic progress.  Because while the bitcoin network remains secure it is the ultimate hard currency.  The reply, to me, makes the point that progress might be measured in many different ways.
What's interesting is that Krugman assumes that a fundamental property of a currency is a stable value.  It is interesting to question what happens to his argument if you relax this to a stable or increasing value ... then what decisions will rational individuals make regarding bitcoin.  It would seem to be a similar problem to one considered by Gresham's Law.

I make very minimal claims about bitcoin - merely that it has some value.  It need not be a large value and as I'm sure you are aware price does not equal value.
Bitcoin, since it is assignable, has obvious productive value as a medium of exchange.  It doesn't matter if it is not the best medium since as long as one person with real world goods to trade wants to acquire it (even if just for nostalgic reasons) then it has *some* real world value.  But I think there is actually good potential for it to improve on traditional bank transfers.  That's because it's much easier to verify a bitcoin transaction compared to a check.   Check scams catch a horrifying number of people each day because banks can't verify check transfers quickly enough before they are required to release funds by the banking regulations.  Checks should work more like bitcoin!

Crypto currencies becoming the primary source of global money supply is a possibility, but seems unlikely.  It's also possible crypto currency make up a sizeable but non-majority of the money supply.  And still also possible that fiat money will be much more valuable than cryptocurrencies in the future (ie Bitcoin crashes) and they make up only a insignificant fraction of the global money supply.
Fiat money has a much narrow range of future possibilities and a greater buffer of liquidity so it's much harder for the market to make big, quick moves.

I would tend to agree.  With the caveat that bitcoin seems to be useful as a currency when the local fiat is (hyper) inflating, and especially to circumvent capital controls, such as currently in Venezuela and perhaps Turkey.
Bitcoin also may turn out to be a good alternative to gold as a store of value.  The fixed supply is superior to gold which increases every year as more is dug out of the ground but the reliance on the continued security of the network is a negative.  It's a bit early to tell how this will shake out.
And finally Bitcoin is currently a pretty good international remittance currency - ie a competitor to Western Union.

I'm not sure I agree on the strength of comparison to the USD though I do agree on many of the points made.
The biggest unaddressed issue in the article is the difference in government induced demand between Bitcoin and USD.  US taxes must be paid in US dollars so there is a widely dispersed and rather high latent demand for USD.  Note that even if you do all your transactions in some other currency or asset, if done in the US then you create tax liabilities that must be paid in US dollars.  The USD and Bitcoin may have various properties that make them good currencies but they don't compete on a fair playing field. [
On the point of durability.  The Bitcoin network must endure for value to remain - which seems likely but is not a guarantee and certainly is different than the chance of the USD enduring.
On the point of fungability.  Electronic cash payments can utilize arbitrary decimal points.  And the pricing of gasoline is the most common consumer interaction with more than two decimals.  So it's not a strong argument taht bitcoin is better.  Furthermore due to the existence of the entire blockchain history you could make an argument that not all satoshi's are equal.  Since you can decide to devalue satoshi's that can be linked to certain other accounts (the most likely devaluer would be accounts associated with less than legitimate activities)

Can the Congress override the Constitution - granting executive powers that have no judicial review?  Article III lays out that no law is above judicial review - and that's the Supreme Court interpretation as originally given in Marbury vs. Madison.
You can claim that the branches should be co-equal arbitrators of the Constitution, but that doesn't match with US history since 1803.  So I'd defer to the courts.
And I'll reiterate that the court's opinion in this case is completely reasonable - that no immediate danger has been shown that justifies ignoring due process and separation of religion and state with an immediate order.  So it does pass the smell test and you are the one making outlandish claims.

It's very difficult to say.  If you mined with only a small hashrate and don't join a pool - then you'd need to get lucky and mine a block.  You would either get a full block reward (currently 12.5 BTC) or nothing.  It's likely you could run solo for years and never mine a block.
Now if you joined a pool or were large enough to be your own pool the cost of mining is the capital cost of the mining hardware and the marginal cost of electricity for the miner and for cooling.  The cost of electricity changes depending on where you live.  4 cents is a good lower number - but certainly not something most people have access to.  A cold environment gives you some savings on cooling.  So with current 14 nm generation ASICS like the S9 you are talking about generating ~$4 worth of bitcoin and paying ~$1.50 for the electricity.  But you need to buy the currently ~$900 machine to do that.  It's not looking good for the future profit of any home miner.
So at current difficulty to make one bitcoin in one week would take 200 S9 miners.   The electricity with 30% extra for cooling would cost ~$2800.  The 200 miners would cost 180k.

Intrinsic value has several definitions that get kicked around, so first you have to define what you mean by intrinsic value.   Commonly it's the value inherit to a thing without regard to it's market price.
Bonds have an intrinsic value because even if you can't sell the bond to others you can just wait around for the full term to collect your money.  Stocks have an intrinsic value because they are an interest in all the future cash flows of a business.  So for financial products you can price the intrinsic value in dollars using some sort of net present value calculation.
Gold is different.  As a commodity you can't price its intrinsic value in dollars.  Instead you can innumerate the inherent uses and possibly infer an inherent demand.  This demand is the piece that is separate from what might be called a speculative demand - the piece from people that only want the commodity to sell it later.  One way people think about inherit value absent the speculative piece (because you can't remove it from real markets) for commodities is saying what use does it have if the price was $0.  But Gold is an odd case for a commodity because a significant use of gold is as a store of value which goes away if the price is zero.  So trying to do an inherent value analysis where you have to ignore gold's use as a store of value seems a bit silly.
So saying Bitcoin lacks inherent value is technically correct (the best kind), but not very useful if it's main value comes instead as a store of value (requires long term access to a market) or medium of exchange (requires short term access to a market).
Yet I still think you are being too hard on gold.  It certainly has a large intrinsic demand from both industrial uses and as a raw input into jewelry.  Gold in jewelry gives it a good shine, is malleable, and doesn't corrode.  Jewelers would still use gold as an input even if it wasn't scarce.  Industrial processes as well.  They use it frequently dispute it's high market price.  Gold has intrinsic value.  But that doesn't mean it needs to have intrinsic value to be useful.

The ability to own and be able to transfer a digital asset without a central authority is a new thing.  Could be worth nothing.  Could be worth some fraction of global wealth.
So on a technicality I don't think it's in bubble territory so much as in price discovery territory.  How can one argue the price is irrational when there is nothing to compare it against (even if it were to fall in value by 90% tomorrow as part of the price discovery)?
The current price appears to be a function of a very inelastic supply.  Care to comment on that?

If I understand it right you are not giving them a line of credit, Alibaba is.  In that setup they are the boots on the ground.
You want to prepay to allow for production, but you want your money back if you don't get delivery.  These are fundamentally opposing goals.  In the case of non-delivery who do you want to be out money?  Probably the supplier but the *escrow* would have already given them the money so your *escrow* is put the money having prepaid the supplier and refunded you.  That's not escrow.  You are looking for the wrong thing by looking for an escrow service

It is assignable and scarce.  Humans are collectors so those properties are enough to make it valuable.  It doesn't guarentee a high value, but is enough to say it is above zero.

Is such a toothpick scarce?  
You assume that it is for your counter-example, but I don't think it is.  When I say scarce I mean something which has more demand than supply (and for now let's limit it to structural, so true for all time)
The toothpick example likely isn't scarce because it would have no demand (that was your whole point, obviously no one would want it).  But if you dig deeper you see it isn't an analogy to bitcoin at all - if you apply the scarcity heuristic you can guess it would have no demand because it is not difficult to recreate.  There are many toothpicks in the world.  There are many homeless people in the world.  It would not be difficult at any time to simply create a new one.  But let's look at the opposite - a toothpick that cannot be recreated.   For instance a toothpick crafted by the legendary (and dead) violin maker Stradivarius now that is something that would be valuable.  But even for that rare toothpick simply having value does not equate to being worth $1M ...
You asked if bitcoin has any value - but you're arguing if bitcoin has a high value / fairly priced based on underlying value.  Those are too different questions.

In my opinion you are asking far too much from even a business credit card.
Your money is at risk when you give it to a supplier.  You cannot do much about that without your own boots on the ground, and even then it would not come cheaply.
Your suppliers need business loans.  If you give them, that's a risk you are taking on

This isn't about any particular currency.
Money has three functions 1) medium of exchange 2) unit of account, and 3) store of value.  These functions are at times at odds with each other so that the ideal store of value may not be the ideal medium of exchange.  And bitcoin so far has looked much more like a store of value than a medium of exchange ...

You need to do more than weigh gold when transacting with it.  One must assay the purity of the gold before accepting it.  It's possible to find situations where gold is a better choice, but it's also possible to find situations where a digital asset is a better choice.  With bitcoin you don't have to trust any one person, just the collective system.

Yes, but it's the same.  Ignoring the fact that a law office may be organized for pass-through taxation, the corporate tax rates are still marginal!

How are you getting that number.
It's not just the prediction that matters.  It's the confidence that goes with it.  A grounded analysis is much more convincing than a baseless claim.  Are you basing this on decreasing supply to market or increasing demand?

Wait a minute.  Big monetary innovations haven't been the big movers that make up your list - why is this time different? 
Why did using coins instead of cattle, goldsmith loans, fractional reserve banking, and fiat currency all have more modest revolutions associated with them than bitcoin will?  (also seems this isn't the first time money has emerged in a new form after all)
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:49:41


so Bitcoin, a technical protocol, has aspirations for a specific way to 'succeed'


and you presume it's to replace fiat currency for everyone reading as a measure of account at the grocery store.
I disagree on both counts.

US tax brackets are marginal.  Let's use your round numbers.  If there are two brackets 25% and 30%.  And the 30% bracket starts at 90k.  Let's say you've got 100k profit.  The first 90k is taxed at 25% and the next 10k is taxed at 30%.  Taking a loss will never lower the percentage charged on the first 90k.
This means that the concept is false.
What you are probably thinking of is sham valuations of illiquid items in order to magnify a charitable donation amount to be more than what could be gotten through sale.  That's tax fraud.  And also depends on using an infrequently traded, hard to value item like a fine painting.  Literally the opposite of bitcoin.

But a currency has at least three functions.  You've highlighted that in bitcoin's case it isn't a great medium of exchange for business to consumer transactions and it isn't a great unit of account for salaries.  Yet so far it's been a terrific store of value - though you point out the forward looking catch 22 paradox.  
So I'd suggest the jury is still out on Bitcoin's utility as a *currency.*  There is certainly the potential over the coming years it ends up as a global settlement and remittance currency or as a valuable risk-off commodity.  But there's also the potential it ends up abandoned and splintered.  We'll have to wait and see.

High transaction fees demonstrate that despite the cost people find value in bitcoin transactions.  And it encourages miners to secure those valuable transactions.
I'm not sure minimum level fees are a good sign for this stage of maturity.

This is the reality
The solow model assumes that the number of workers and the level of technology grow at an exponential rate.  It shouldn't be surprising that it gives a resultant exponential GDP growth.  It fits post-industrial US economic data really well, so the model may be a good fit for the past and a predictor of the future *if underlying  conditions do not change*.  For a large part of human history the level of technology growth has been zero and per capita GDP has been constant - here is one discussion of it 
If you use solow and assume linear growth of technology then you get linear growth.  It would be pure folly to try to guess when we will switch from exponential to linear growth but you haven't proven me wrong until you can show exponential growth can continue forever.  I know of no natural or manmade case where that is true save models that are oversimplified ie bank interest (name a bank that would have worked over 1,000 years, model is oversimplified without chance of failure)
@_date: 2015-11-29 02:55:28
Afaik exponential growth of technology/efficiency/GDP has only been experienced since the industrial revolution.  That's a blip on even the human history timescale.
And if there is one thing that is shared by all known exponential growth processes - man-made or natural -it is that they eventually reach a saturation limit and cease to be exponential growth.
I'm not saying we are done growing exponentially - but it seems silly to expect it to continue forever.
@_date: 2018-04-25 02:05:08
It depends very much on your definition of currency.  By academic standards you could make an argument it fulfills some of the definitions, ie its money because it's a unit of account, store of value, and/or medium of exchange.  Colloquially if by currency you mean what you use to buy a coffee or something issued by a government to facilitate exchange/pay taxes then it's straightforward to evaluate Bitcoin against that instead.  The hard part is agreeing on the definition imo

Bitcoin has great "first mover advantage" as digital, distributed money
While the blockchain technology will almost certainly be used for other distributed accounting applications in order to supplant it as the primary distributed currency the new comer would have to be better than bitcoin as a medium of exchange or a store of value.
It seems more likely that the digital aspects of bitcoin could find themselves facing a better product than the distributed aspects that use the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-04-09 19:47:42
The miner reward is still 12.5 btc so that's subsidizing the security of the network and certainly helping drive network growth.  But the novel thing is a digital asset **that can be transferred** via a distributed network.  
One hopes that if it is truly a valuable thing that people will compete for the available transaction block space.
