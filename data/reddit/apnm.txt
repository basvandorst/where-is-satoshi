Hi, I would also appreciate if you could hook me up with a trial, if it is still available? Great work OP

Look up situational irony...

THIS. I wanted to make sure someone already said so before commenting. I was unaware of the tulip metaphor until recently, so decided to at least do some cursory research. (Wiki obviously). It explains exactly what you stated.  Good looking out and Good Look ; )  , specifically 'Modern Views.'
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:36:36
Agreed. I come across a post like this every so often. It seems like utter bullshit to me.
The responses tend to hint that the party responsible is some criminal organization that will hunt down the OP.

May be considered a type of situational irony. Irony has different forms, from a literary device perspective.

Guy, read through that forum thread. HIS gf went to the lesbian bar.

2015 mark?

Do any of you actually receive the price alert? On my iPhone, the alerts either don't trigger or they do so too late.

Thank you for connecting the not so earlies to this story! Wish I currently had enough coin to tip you .01 BTC. All in due time...

So, you're saying it WAS situational irony? The link you provided seems to suggest this. ; ) Your case for us, as the audience, being entertained by something the OP was not himself aware of may be an example of dramatic irony. Also, situational irony, as an 8th grader may learn, is the occurrence of something when that is the last thing one expects to occur. His hearing bitcoin talk at another table while checking coinbase seems to be in line with this, or even when he asked if the man was talking bitcoin, as he may have expected him to say no. I still side with the former. Thanks for the mental exercise. : )

Yeah that happens. Having ocd tendencies (to say the least), I skimmed through that whole conversation one night because people on reddit kept saying it was one or the other. He refers to himself as a dude and there are several other messages he writes where it seems clear he is male. Not that it matters, except for ocd's sake. Happy hodling my friend

Good info, thanks dude. I've been buying to hodl, but recently have been considering buying to hodl and trade. This is an interesting approach. Any other feedback/advice you are willing to spare? Did you send directly between the exchanges? I know LTC transactions are faster, but I read recently Bittrex customers were experiencing issues withdrawing. Any knowledge is appreciated, thanks again

Dangerous in what regard? As in they are going to hunt down or pay someone to hunt down billyhoylechem for voicing his opinion over a platform that is meant for voicing one's opinion? 
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:14:01
Goes to show how fucked it is to gauge tone over text. Until your response, I thought he used 'please' genuinely. As in "Please bitcoin, may I have s'more."
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:08:00
Haha thanks for the explanation. I don't generally watch crypto Youtubers so I didn't get the joke/reference. I thought billyhoylecham's argument was sound. I also understood your defense of Polk, as I clicked on the above video and was entertained without feeling the guy was full of shit. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:06:33
Dominant in what sense? As in people were using encyclopedias as their go-to for information? Or are you strictly talking from a business perspective? This kind of reminds me of blockchain over cryptocurrencies or alt over bitcoin.

Literally killing themselves? I haven't come across that yet, but have been hearing about it being a possibility for weeks. Any sources?
