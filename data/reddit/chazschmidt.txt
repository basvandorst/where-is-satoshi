You're proving my point. Journalism is under attack from all angles (regardless of it is justified at times). Yes, Obama had a bad record for abusing power on the press and he wasn't the first to start this chain of events but the stakes have changed. Trump isn't solely to blame but he took the gloves off so to speak. Trump/MAGA/GOP ushered in this era of post-truth. The fact you use the words "fake news" shows how even our societal discourse erodes the idea of reporting /news ever being truthful. If journalism wasn't under attack, we'd use the same language we used in the past "biased reporting."

I never said that. If you're average Joe is subjected to endless surveillance, why should those with power be able to hide in the dark? Why shouldn't public servants be held to a decent level of transparency?

Ok. Here's a start: how do you plan on transferring the cryptocurrency into fiat to buy property or make debit cards, etc?
