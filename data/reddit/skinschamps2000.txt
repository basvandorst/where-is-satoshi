dang, well, guess I need to get to the moon and start selling plots. lol
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:00:35
because the whole point is to get away from the corrupt banking systems of the Rothchilds. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:04:20
They can collect my taxes when they get taxes from people at their garage sales. lol.

when I see the words collapse, crash, and so on, it is an immediate red flag. a collapse would be 18k to 200 dollars within 3 hours, a correction is going from 18k to 16k. These articles are done by people who do not have any money to invest or are mad they didnt jump in earlier. lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:35:50
yes on all

Ok, maybe moon 2 then. lol

I buy a little of Bit, Lite, and Ether every day, 5 to 10, then on payday I speculate who may have the better week and put another 100 there. I have been buying BitBay, it is literally a penny stock like crypto, but if you look up what the company itself is doing, I believe it may turn into a paypal like company for bitcoin transactions. So, I own 10000 pieces of BitBay that I bought for an average of 0.0000645 BTC each. Now, if I specualte right and they become a huge company and all it ever does is get to a $10 BTC equal in price. I will be pretty happy, if it bust and never does a thing, I may be out a couple of 100 dollars. But, I have spent that on worthless crap in my life.

according to our Treasury Secretary Bitcoin is not real money. So, why would you pay tax on fake money? That would mean everytime you bought a Monopoly game you would have to pay Capital gains on that fake money in the game. Leave it to Big Brother to tax something they think is fake.

np, ask me anything anytime
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:24:40
Here's my thought on the matter, what if I took all the money and say, bought an island somewhere, created a sovereign nation then asked the US for foreign aid. Then, make them pay me and still pay no capital gain tax.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:14:36
I cashed out of coinbase last week no problem have reinvested and withdrawn again. If that helps

As long as you have the receipt, you monies will show within the next 7 days. I have had this happen once or twice. Other times it shows up right away. But, you get th buy in or sell price quoted on the receipt.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:23:22
Why would you sell for a loss then rebuy? You buy more when its lower otherwise why did you buy in the first place? Because you thought it was going to go up right? So, its still going to , why not gt more, then your cost dollar average would be less overall. Thats the smart move here.

Well, I bought Bitcoin in 2011, just 4 of them, spent 13 a piece. Now, years later, I think it was August 2017 I finally started investing. Now, I am buying 10 to 20 dollars worth a week. kicking myself, I knew it would be something, I will tell you for fact. This is only the beginning. When major money people are pushing people to invest in this you just do it. 
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:21:36
Right, Here is my intangible item, and my intangible tax.
@_date: 2019-06-28 06:56:27
pfft, I ain't paying no stinking taxes.
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:23:22
I have my wallet at coinbase. I bought 4 of them in 2011 for about $13 a piece when I first heard about them. When they hit $4k earlier this year I began to buy more in small increments every payday. Have another .4654 of another one from that. After all my research I truly believe this is only the beginning as speculators and casual investors who see and hear of people becoming millionaires will buy in as well helping to inflate. Also causing a surge in miners. The biggest thing that convinced me that this is the future is a friend of mine who is a retirement manager started taking his commissions and buying all he could with them every month.

I bought 1 full one for me and each of my daughters back in 2010, they are all now in college, I told them to wait until they graduate and have a down payment on a house. As soon as they started taking it in Vegas I knew it has no real cap. As time passes we will hate ourselves for not buying back when it was under 10k. This is the future of crypto.

Last week I sold almost everything I owned and bought in at 5300, when it hit 7200 today I was laughing, some people cant see it. But, yeah, think of it this way, if you buy even a half of a coin today at 7200 and it hits 10k in the next 6 to 8 weeks and show your dad how much he missed out on, he will believe then. Watch the movie casino and in it when the plane has a "mechanical problem" and the bring the Asian gambler Ichikawa back to the casino, listen to Deniro's statement. Its not about how much he was winning, he saw it as losing because he played too low. Same thing here. A person who says money isn't everything has to ask themselves a question. If its not everything, why does a guy like Bill Gates and Warren Buffet get up and go to work like a common guy at Mickey D's? Cause its never enough.

BEtween now and April, figure some will sell of a bit for presents and taxes, 529 plans and the like. Then, around the Superbowl something major betting wise will happen with Bitcoin along with March Madness. Then Boom, it will b the talk of the world. Gold Rush of 1840s will have nothing on this.
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:31:08
lol, no, I am 48 and retired. I still do secret shopper work and resume writing. I am disabled, so I can only do small jobs.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:48:11
Dropping hard, real hard would b going back to 4k or 5k, not 7800 to 7200. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:50:31
Just show him the last year and how it has rocketed, also, this IS the future of money. Imagine if he had bought a year ago, and even if it only did half of what has where would he be and what other investment would make him what he has. I believe it will hit 10k by Christmas.
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:47:35
lol. almost 11k now, I say go for the 12k, live large
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:29:04
Not sure what your credit score is or your age. But, I would go to Credit Karma and check your score and they will direct you to credit cards you could qualify for. You could buy the max let it grow and on the last day your payment is due pull that amount out and pay the card off then you play with what you have left. As for a job from home the best paying legit ones are transcriptions jobs. Pay is decent
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:33:06
Yes I do, and its the long haul game. 25k by end of next year easily

I have been a holder since 2012, I get pissed off at the use of words, for perspective, Gas is $2.49 a gal. today, tomorrow its at 1.99 thats not a plummet, plunge or anything like that. and constantly doing that when it happens is hyperbole and uncalled for. Now, if it went to .49 then I am fine with the word plummet being used. But, these pop up everytime bitcoin goes below a level. ending in 000. Funny thing is, looking at it from a 2 year ago investment, plummet and other downward words are just ignorant. And people doing it just tick me off, because they have no reason for doing it. Its just uncalled for.
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:28:41
Plummet? Plunge? Crash? Bottoms Out?   Look, stop the sky is falling crap. Yestrday it was over 10k, today its at 9700, thats not a plummet. Whats your agenda? You didnt buy in at $50 or less and made no money, but want to and b a cool kid so making post that say plummet can maybe get people to sell off in a panic so you can try and buy in and make a huge profit? Or you have no clue how it works and are mad that people made money and you didnt? Just stop. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:15:13
I buy $5 a week on payday regardless of its price, the cost dollar average over time will pay it off. So far I have spent $150 what I have is worth about $210 as of today, not a lot now, but I will eventually have a full coin.
