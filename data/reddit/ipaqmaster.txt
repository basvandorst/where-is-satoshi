I know!! What the fuck is actually going on here, I cant think of the word but it feels like a really bad image to make of cryptocurrency as such. All those poorer people who cant afford this technology watching it get smashed.

**POTENTIAL TROLL POST**
Bitcoin was an idea!
All the others leaching off its open-source'ness are just riding the train, and hell they're working too!
The idea behind a currency is that it's only worth anything because people *Think* it is.

Oh shittt!

It seems more like a reinvention to me
@_date: 2014-01-23 06:32:44
Yes that's a completely true and positive side, with google's support, people who have it can rejoice from how expensive it becomes and more people can learn. I hope they get servers dedicated to transaction confirmations etc for the world too. But only if needed I guess

Well, it's data. It exists less than the dollar bill people take for valve today. 
The reason for its high value is the belief that its worth something. Not to mention unlike government currency, once it runs out you can't print more

Good one

You can hate the phone all you wish, but surely there are unlucky people who could benefit from the phone or money. It just looks  as a waste of hardware and nothing else. 
Your replies to the other comments above mine are about choosing software and crap like that, it makes no ethical sense to just destroy such a high valued set of hardware (no matter how much you dislike it) just for the rise you seem to get.

That's true, so many people would want it it would delay for ages too. By that time mining wouldn't be worth it with everybody stocked with these
@_date: 2014-01-10 10:21:00
Get out of here with your spam
@_date: 2014-01-09 07:30:59
I would love if it could be used for video games too.
Wait, can it? Or simply only mining.

Thanks. I didn't want my only option to be '...or login' with a sliced paragraph.

Excitement will never be as high!
@_date: 2014-01-23 01:26:01
I don't know why but I get the sensation that big corporations [Google..] are just going to grab a majority of Bitcoin over time and just.. have it. Not spend it etc.
@_date: 2014-01-07 11:22:32
This is true. And not just a shortcut. A shortcut that tells the cmd to treat it like a program anyways. The biggest giveaway was the text files.. well, text? :P and the shortcut being needed.
If the text file was marked as hidden, you didn't see hidden by settings and you didn't catch on, somebody MIGHTTT fall for it.

If it really could be used on minecrafts rendering then it would work on everything else :\
0/10 not convinced
@_date: 2014-02-09 08:03:51
I was gonna say. It must be worth thousands now.
@_date: 2013-11-10 11:15:41
This. all the way. They really are hard to take care of compared to something that's in hand. Especially with all the theft.

He's pretty swell.

Wonder what south park are going to do on it, this is pretty big.
@_date: 2013-12-11 02:09:09
Very interesting

Crawl into a corner with a 9mm and trust nothing!
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:17:28
Looks like somebody was more interested in self profit than watching bitcoin itself grow.
@_date: 2013-12-29 11:15:34
Yes, if you buy it for low, you can still purchase things with it. If the price for Bitcoin rises to $1000 again, and you brought lets say, 3 bitcoins at $250 each, then prices on websites would adjust for when you purchase them with bitcoin. **TECHNICALLY** You would make a profit by paying way less than you would have if you would purchace it in USD for example.
That is the way I personally use it. Not buy for USD then sell back but rather buy for USD then use as its own currency. If the price for them goes up then I would be paying a lot less for things than I would with physical currency.
But that's just my opinion on the situation :)
There is a lot of talk going on about currency vs commodity on it however in the end the choice is up to you. You're better off having some experience if you plan to do day trading with it
@_date: 2013-12-05 01:55:16
That's an interesting scenario to be in, no money but your family gave you bitcoins to survive
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:19:36
Buy coins for $1k sell for $500 Can confirm am broke now
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:18:45
That's how trading works for fek sake. How does one get that wrong.
@_date: 2013-12-09 04:00:10
It's gonna happen..

Any post (LET ALONE ON FACEBOOK, you know, the place that is most known for pages trying to sell you shoes and tagging your friends in the posts, asking you to like and share shit for some reason that makes no sense and tagging friends) that asks me to Like or Share something for a prize that many have tried to get, ruining my accounts reputation as a human being by falling for that publicity shit.
Way too many idiots on social networking platforms, and this guys just trying to take advantage of it.
Bad post / 10
@_date: 2013-12-11 03:06:16
Well, gee
Thanks internet friend!
@_date: 2013-12-02 01:41:36
Their references sure do get picked up
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:33:57
Well yeah, I mean, moneys fuckin' cool man but my goal here is to see this itself become a currency instead of trading it like a commodity like people have.
@_date: 2013-12-26 14:23:15
@_date: 2013-12-03 00:26:07
I almost thought this wasn't the sub it was that bad.
@_date: 2013-12-11 01:59:15
Regardless, doing those things in order to debate about them from experience would be interesting.
or increase the death toll
@_date: 2013-12-29 10:41:53
Buy when its low and sell when its high to generate a profit for yourself. 
The general mindset that you are supposed to have is not treating it as a commodity that you trade off for real money, but to treat it as a currency itself. Crypto-currencys will never grow if people just look at them as a slab of ore that you need to sell as soon as its profitable, instead of looking at is like you do at the value of the dollar bill.
But with every great thing there will always be the people who do something else. No, solo mining bitcoins not profitable. If you really are in it for the money then trading is the way to go.
