Bitcoin is becoming a religion. Thing to remember, best things in life are those that cannot be measured in USDs. For the moment everyone is talking about price of bitcoin, which means that they did not understand anything. 99.9% of people in bitcoin just think about getting rich in USD and that is why it's failing.
We may actually pay with diamonds. There is a limited supply, mining expensive, needs to be kept under a lock. You will need someone to verify if your diamond is real. Most of the businesses do not accept payment in diamonds. Did we actually come up with something new here? Or we are just trying to use a screwdriver to scratch our back? It actually feels like scratching our ears for the moment.

And this is IMO why BTC was a great experiment but not usable for everyday payments. Same as lumps of gold. It may have value but a huge overhead. Lots of people got on this bandwagon with hopes of getting rich but this bubble is bursting as soon as the people will put 2 and 2 together.

Damn, really? If there is one sure thing I would be betting on food, water and shelter. But I guess you are right with all the floods and landslides all over the place. Over-inflated property prices in all the big cities. All the graphs that I looked at show rising trend with occasional drops over the years but overall 20x the value compared to 1970.

The decentralizest of them all.

I remember there was that storage argument that your DB will take up hundreds of Gigabytes of space once you increase the block size. I don't think this should be a concern. Storage space is getting cheaper than ever.

Great, who's the old guy next to satoshi?
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:42:11
I say hold... on to your hats, it's gonna be a bumpy descent. I just wish all the people manage to get out at the price they got in.
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:39:25
Exactly, this is not a currency anymore. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:15:33
I am convinced that governments will do everything in their power to keep their most efficient tool of control over people. I am pretty sure that legislation and regulation of majority of the countries will totally screw any attempt to have any free uncontrolled currency.

Yes, there is a lot of emotion in this. Some will be believers until the bitter end. As an observer I can stay unbiased and I see it this way.

This is Winston Churchill's quote.
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:02:52
Correct. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 08:33:16
Stupid religious statements.
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:15:34
Haha if Becky gets to you man it means that you are really on the edge. Make sure you don't have access to any weapons. You should forget this shit for now. Take a few months break. Your looking at the chart daily will not magically make the value go up. You own crypto,you should be happy about that. Value does not matter. It will come later. What should I say? I don't even have crypto. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:35:29
Same as you need bitcoin network to verify your hashes. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:43:55
It did already, there used to be a gold rush, people selling all their belongings, just to be able to go to new sites all around the world buy a piece of land and hoping to find gold. I hear the same stories now. People selling their houses to buy bitcoin. There are already suicides linked to price of bitcoin and there will be more. Big investors being able to capitalize on mining while small guy not being able to earn enough to sustain the costs. I see a lot of resemblance. As other people said here. Bitcoin does not have other use than currency therefore I see it's future quite bleek. Distributed ledger technology however is a great success. Bitcoin to me is/was an experiment and it's reaching it's end. At the end of the day there are more efficient crypto currencies out there. This one is unfortunately still the most popular. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:56:27
That is what I think too. It would be a good idea to put 20000 usd into each of them and one of them will make you a millionaire and then you just write off the loss of 300,000 on the rest that did not succeed. Brute force trading :D
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:50:58
Store of value is and always was real estate. It's an estate that is real, unlike money.

I would call it state of total confidence. It will dip 500 times again this year. Just trust it. Don't count on it as your retirement fund. Easy come easy go worst case scenario.
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:04:42
I know how it works. It's so trustless that no one accepts your payment until it's verified. And it does not need to be a guy, it can be a device. The point is bitcoin is simulation of something that already existed with additional challenges, and it's proving to be useless. You cannot pay unless you have access to your hashes and infrastructure that proves it. Bitcoin to me is nothing more than an experiment.

Funny thing about stairs, they go up and down at the same time. This is so spot-on.

Another reference to exchange value against FIAT.

We have seen South Korea recently if I am not mistaken.

One thing is for sure that it's a great hobby with a glimmer of hope of getting rich :D.

Exchange of limited commodity for goods and services in general. There are indisputable advantages of alt-currency for the people compared to currency in circulation.
I don't mean to argue, but I see it this way. The only advantage over diamonds is that value can be transported over the internet with use of encryption. But from what I hear transaction sometimes taking 4 days to confirm, the chances are that your tiny rock would get there earlier with UPS. I don't mean to ridicule Bitcoin in it's current state and I wish that these problems will be eventually ironed out but my view is very pessimistic concerning it's future at the moment. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:04:17
It's not that bad. Let me know when it will be back to $200 then I will tell you so...:D
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:01:45
Despite all this, I would sell. It's going to burst. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:19:41
Maybe if you wish strongly enough, it will become true. I heard a similiar story about tulips. Buy tulips and don't ever sell them.
@_date: 2018-03-20 03:28:10
Those coins are forever lost.

I am happy that I never intended to take it.

I think they are high already.

Yes it's predicted 3 times every minute by different bitcoin owners. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 17:09:18
Stupid that you have to battle your own network. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:00:02
I think bitcoin is becoming an altcoin ultimately turning into shitcoin.

Wow what a serious crypto application.
