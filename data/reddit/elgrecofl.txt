Don't put them in the closet. Give them to a friend who will appreciate them. Even if they are not profitable, they are an excellent way to light the crypto flame in one of your techie-friends. Pass the torch, man.

I found his initial mailing list post and the exchange that followed to be fascinating as well.

You can make it look like an iPhone, but you can't make it behave like one. 
I have to say, having recently switched to Android after being an iPhone user since launch, I'm not impressed. Hardware and ideology aside, if we're talking about a pure OS experience, I think Apple has a much better phone for the average consumer.
When I switched to Android, I got superior hardware, access to bitcoin wallets, the freedom to install whatever I want, and the joy of saying "eff you" to Apple and their totalitarian system. What I also got was a phone with a clunkier UI; no organization as far as system and application settings, location, and privacy controls; and a play store that not only has less depth than the app store, it also has a much greater likelihood of hosting something that will get me pwned.
I need anti-virus and malware protection on my phone? wut?
Anyway, I understand that everything is a compromise and I'll be sticking with Android for all the good reasons I stated above, but I definitely can't recommend it to the average consumer that doesn't care about the ideology it represents or the customization it allows. iOS just feels so much more seamless.

I'd like a Chumby Bitcoin ticker for bitfinex :)

Pebble is waterproof, if that matters to you. I love having mine on at the pool or beach.

Quick math tells me you'd have roughly a 1:25,000 chance of solving a block in a 24-hour period.

Be careful, some of them have 48 hour time limit before deleting the key.

How'd it go? Everyone saying "just pay them" is correct. You really have no choice if you ever want to see your files again. It's amazing how nasty  this type of ransomware is.

Customers pay in BTC, he pays his employees and suppliers in BTC, soon their local lunch shop will begin accepting BTC to grab their sales, then other restaurants will accept it to grab their dinner business, then the grocery store, then.... the moon. 
This is how it begins.
This is gentlemen.

It's flawless on my 4s. I normally don't even get a chance to see it centered before it registers.

Good luck, man. I'd definitely tip you. What part of the country are you in?

**Edit** I stand corrected. Still would like to see a iOS 6 version though :)
Agreed. You pretty much need to be jailbroken to have a functional bitcoin wallet, and most jailbreakers are still on iOS 6.

I don't know about anyone else, but this is def worth a RT.

You guys have a website? I'll try some bitcoin chocolate :)

Yea, I had the bad luck of them disappearing right before I hit my auto-payout threshold too :(.

This. I remember it like it was yesterday. The gox trading engine overloaded, people were placing market sell orders that weren't getting filled for over an hour. Gox finally shut the system down and didn't bring it back up for days. I may pastebin some irc logs later if I feel up to it. It was a perfect storm with gox deserving the lions share of the blame.

Really? When did that change? I thought apple forced them to remove that functionality a long time ago. Even the blockchain.info website says it: 
"Due to restrictions from Apple the bitcoin wallet functionaility is not available in the app store version. However it is still available for free download with limited features."
I'm too lazy to remove my cydia version and try it, guess I'll have to take your word for it. Someone should tell the blockchain guys to update their site.
