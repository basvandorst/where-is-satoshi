This is not unique to Bitcoin. People used to (and still do) store their physical gold at home, and they had to weigh the counterparty risk against the risk of theft/fire at home. Same with paper money. Do I trust a bank, and live with the counterparty risk, or keep my paper notes in my mattress, and live with other risks. The answer depends upon the individual. Some people are security and tech savvy, and are willing to handle everything on their own. Others aren't. Many will fall in the middle, and use a hardware/paper wallet for large sums, and keep "spending money" in places like coinbase/mycelium etc.

It was being political that lost his father's hard won support to begin with. People want to hear Paulian rhetoric out of this young man, but his political aspirations prevent him from speaking plainly. That's why it looks like he has no spine. He can't shoot from the hip, because he has to measure his words and appear as "electable" as possible, which completely neuters him and his position. So no, he doesn't need to be more political. He needs to realize that the only way he wins is by changing hearts and minds to his position, rather than hoping to water down his position enough to appeal to regular Republicans. No matter what he's probably not presidential material, but at least he could follow in his dad's footsteps and educate the public.

Hoarding is a loaded term. It is just saving, and it performs a valuable function in the economy. The idea that spending is the only thing that drives an economy forward is just the broken window fallacy. Saving affects the price of the money commodity, which guides decisions in the economy. The fear of deflation is unfounded.

Imagine you wanted dollars, and imagine you found this machine that gave you free pennies, you just had to crank a handle over and over to get them. Unless your time has extremely low value, you'd be better off just working at your real job and earning money. It's like that with these faucets. 
The only thing is most of us believe bitcoin is going to be worth much much more in the future, so the trivial pocket change these faucets hand out could one day actually be worth something. But so much more the case with just buying/earning the btc directly.

I will argue that gold doesn't have intrinsic value. Neither do bananas. Nothing has intrinsic value. If there were no people, gold would have no value. Value is only in the minds of the people doing the valuing. Even if everyone agrees that gold is valuable, it's still not inherent or intrinsic to gold itself. Even if it's the inherent or intrinsic properties of gold itself that make people value it, it doesn't mean the value is somehow inherent or intrinsic. Does petroleum have intrinsic value? Did it before people discovered it could be used in internal combustion engines?

I'm a libertarian, so I feel comfortable saying this, but bitcoin attracts liberty people, and liberty people are often social outcasts. They don't fit in, so they are attracted to a philosophy which make them out to be superior and everyone else "sheeple". So bitcoin has some of that element within it too. Probably the creepy objectivist streak.
I don't know enough about that guy to say for sure, but that's the *vibe* I get from him. Anyway it doesn't matter. He can be private if he wants, I just don't understand why he would agree to speak publicly if he won't even answer innocent questions like what year he first became involved in bitcoin.

The frustration you're feeling is what many of us feel toward the *truly* archaic (good word) regulations that make purchasing bitcoin with fiat such a hassle. But to blame this friction on bitcoin, even though it's the old system causing the problems, is unfair. It's as though someone invented a flying car, but government regulations made it so that you could only take flight from an approved airport, after jumping through ridiculous hoops and waiting in long lines. Once you're up in the air it's great, but talking off and landing is still horrible because of all the outdated rules and restrictions. 
But you're right, the difficulty you're experiencing is a major obstacle in the way of mass adoption. Coinbase has done a lot, but clearly more needs to be done.

You're only thinking about supply. Demand is the other determinant. It could be that the price will rise for the next 25 years as the inflation rate diminishes, but then some amazing new app is developed that causes the value to skyrocket. Or an amazing new computing breakthrough that can overpower SHA256, which could make the price 0. In other words, it's impossible to value btc looking only at supply.

I wouldn't wish Alzheimer's on my worst enemy, but it was wise of Satoshi to keep himself hidden. He should remain so until bitcoin's future becomes more certain. He could safely reveal himself after bitcoin becomes widely adopted as a global reserve currency, or else after it fails and crashes to 0. Anything in between and he risks far too much. Just look at the most recent fake Satoshi. He had his home raided by his government within hours of being doxxed. Yes I know that was for a tax issue, but the timing seemed mighty convenient did it not. So the real Satoshi is doing the right thing by remaining hidden (most likely in plain sight).

To really describe how things work in reference to the police in the US, I would reformulate it as follows:

2. You feel that infringes on your freedom, and refuse.
3. He tries to grab you.
4. You reach for your gun.
5. He beats you on the draw and caps you.
They shoot people for not complying with police officers in the US, no matter how trivial the initial encounter. 
Or, here's another reductio ad absurdum:
1. You break into somebody's house.

5. The homeowner shoots you.

Why the loaded term "hoarding"? It's called saving, and it provides a useful function both to the individual and to the network as a whole. If everybody who got btc immediately turned around and spent it, there would be tremendous downward pressure on the fiat value of btc. 
So an equally valid question would be, why would businesses be interested in accepting a money that nobody is interested in holding onto? 
The truth is that each individual should do what makes sense in his/her particular situation. The network can accommodate both savers and spenders.

Look, obviously being jailed and being shot are not _the same thing_. That isn't what I was saying. All I was pointing out was that there's no difference in principle between the two. It's like saying that nobody has been shot for not paying their taxes. 
If my point still isn't clear, I'm saying that any time somebody is hauled off to prison, that's clearly done at gunpoint. Whether the guns are used or not is simply a matter of compliance.
This whole discussion may or may not even apply to Bitcoin at present. In the US, I don't think anyone has been jailed for using bitcoin. It wouldn't surprise me if in less-free places some had. But if anyone ever does get jailed simply for using bitcoin, it isn't any victory to the Bitcoin community to say "at least he wasn't shot!"

I'm also skeptical of bits, but yes, people have a hard time with keeping track of, say, 4 versus 5 decimal places. 
And mBTC, uBTC, μBTC, cBTC - these are unfamiliar and intimidating to non-scientists and non-mathemeticians. Once you learn them, they're easy to forget, since they aren't widely used. The next time you see someone quote a price in one of them, you are likely to have forgotten how much they're worth, and of course they are fractions of a commodity whose value is constantly fluctuating. 
That's why, for me at least, I find the most comfort in thinking in terms of 1 Bitcoin, and then figuring out decimals. It's maybe more time consuming than talking in terms of smaller denominations, but at least I know I won't be making grave errors based on weird terminology I don't understand. And I've been involved in Bitcoin for a couple years now. I can only imagine what somebody just figuring this out today must feel.

No need to read that deeply into it. 
I was assuming he had somebody in mind who had been jailed since he said "can't think of anyone getting shot" rather than "can't think of anyone getting shot or jailed". 
Whether the high profile arrests of people like Charlie Shrem can be reasonably thought of as being "for using bitcoin" or not is debatable. Certainly though it's only a matter of time given the impossible contradictions between FINCEN and the IRS. And if not in the US then elsewhere in more draconian settings.
I hope you can finally find peace and comfort. Being baffled is an exhausting experience.

Jews have a long history in banking, because Jews have historically been social outcasts practically everywhere they have gone. One of the problems that social outcasts face is they don't have access to many of the reputable industries and lines of work in their societies. During the medieval period, when the Church ran the show throughout much of Europe, its confused theories on "the just price" and "usury" made lending with interest illegal or at least very limited. No reputable person would charge interest, because it was against the law, and you would go to hell or something.
So Jews, who were already pariahs, had much less to lose, and much more to gain, by entering into this business. Coupled with their cultural frugality and relatively simple lifestyle, they were able to profit handsomely throughout Europe by lending money and earning interest. By the time the Church's influence began to wane, and its bad economic theories lost respect, banking, as well as related fields like economics, accounting, and finance, had become something of a natural fit for the Jewish people.

That is _precisely_ what logical positivism is. [See?](
As for your assertion that math isn't a science, look, you're just begging the question. You define science, not as the systematic pursuit of knowledge, as it has traditionally been defined. Instead, you narrowly confine it to that pursuit of knowledge that relies upon a posteriori evidence. Anything that falls outside that realm is therefore called unscientific, but why? All you've done is assume away the very thing that's in question.
To quote [Mises](


Dogmatically asserting that science is only that which proceeds according to a narrowly-defined positivistic "scientific method" is the height of scientism, which is in fact unscientific, as Hayek [discussed in his Nobel Acceptance speech](

It certainly doesn't reject it. The Austrian position is that empirical evidence is simply not an appropriate foundation for economic theory. It can demonstrate theory, and is indispensable for economic history. But no amount of evidence can disprove diminishing marginal utility.
Even economists from other traditions implicitly agree, despite their lip service to hyper-empiricism. If a dataset seemed to indicate an upward sloping demand curve, they wouldn't throw the law of demand out the window. They would maintain their "unscientific" apriorism and look for other factors to explain the anomaly.

If you listen to his argument, he distinguishes bitcoin from the dollar by saying that the dollar's anchor is that you have to pay taxes with it. This is apparently where Krugman believes the dollar gets its fundamental value. And so, since bitcoin does not have this anchor, it must be a bubble waiting to collapse. 
Not saying it's a good argument (what about all the other fiat currencies that had the tax anchor, yet went bust anyway?), but it is more sophisticated than saying the dollar is backed by some tangible asset, which of course is false.

Now you're just going in circles. Bitcoin may not be the most technically advanced of the cryptocurrencies; there are a lot of experiments, but none have proven themselves to be valued by the market to any great extent. If one day a competing cryptocurrency renders bitcoin obsolete with some whizbang feature, then probably bitcoin will begin to lose its network advantage as people switch over. But as it currently stands, bitcoin is the best combination of advanced features and a thriving, relatively large network.
Betamax was more advanced than VHS, but VHS was more popular so it became the industry standard. Then later DVD came along and made them both obsolete.

It isn't that Facebook is unbeatable, just that it has a large advantage. When a lot of people ("bigness", which is the concept you're having a hard time grasping) use a network, that network is really powerful and valuable. It can be unseated by a better version, but it's much more difficult. 
Bitcoin is similar. There are altcoins with different features than bitcoin, and it's true that someday one of them may unseat it, but Bitcoin is "big". This means it has powerful advantages that any upstart altcoin would have to reckon with in order to unseat it. So it's not just about features, it's about the network.

At present, the smallest unit of bitcoin is the satoshi. So it's not infinitely divisible. However, should the need arise at some future date, the satoshi could be divided (via hard fork, which would require wide consensus on the network) into smaller units. This would likely only occur in the event of extremely large price increases in the btc exchange rate with major alternative currencies (eg, $5 per satoshi). This is obviously very unlikely, though not theoretically impossible. In that instance, consensus to make the satoshi more divisible would be reached, and it would happen.

Even if traditional banks are innovating in the p2p space, they still are still bound by borders. Bitcoin is not. No bank in the world is going to facilitate p2p money transfers beyond a border that their government doesn't want them to. This is where bitcoin can be extremely useful. It's censorship-proof. 
Also, so much of the philosophy that underpins bitcoin is based on the premise that traditional, government managed banking/monetary systems are fundamentally flawed. Satoshi developed bitcoin to act like digital "gold". So if you share that economic worldview, bitcoin is going to be a lot more attractive, irrespective of the lower transaction costs. It is an innovative way to tap into the desire that many people have to hedge against what they perceive to be an inevitable disaster within the fiat money system. 
Finally, even if most of the modern western world never gets around to fully adopting bitcoin, that doesn't mean bitcoin has no use. According to estimates by the World Bank, there are over 5 billion unbanked and underbanked people in the world. Whether due to bad laws, bad infrastructure, or both, many people simply have no means to access this advanced interbank transfer system. They can't even get a bank account. So they have to keep their savings under their mattress, to be eaten away by the inflation of the fiat money they're forced into using. Bitcoin for these people represents an incredible leap forward, like going from having no phone in the 90s to having a cell phone, bypassing the entire landline phase of telecommunications. 
In other words, bitcoin *is* offering a superior p2p payments system for the world, if for no other reason than the world is bigger than the US, Canada, Western Europe, and Japan. If we had to wait for traditional banking networks to organically develop throughout subsaharan africa and south america, we would miss out on some incredible advancements that bitcoin could foster.

If you believe it is undervalued and you have some disposable income, then yes, now is a good time to invest. If you don't know, or if you can't afford to lose any money on a risky investment, then now is a bad time to invest.

People who downvote this sentiment are stuck in a Keynesian influenced "spending is good for the economy" mindset, or more accurately, "saving is bad for the economy." It's just not true. Certainly any functioning money requires some amount of liquidity, which mean some people need to be willing to spend. But it doesn't follow from that that all people in that economy have a responsibility to spend. They do not. Saving effectively reduces the money supply, which increases the purchasing power of that money. Ooh scary, deflation. Spending has the opposite effect. Neither of these is good or bad for the economy. They just *are*, and a free market is perfectly capable of adjusting prices to match changes in preferences by holders of a money to increase or decrease cash balances.

I love how ginned up the audience is for him. Who was the fluffer that came out before these guys and got the audience so giddy? She asks him about bitcoin and you hear the audible inward gasps like "oh here it comes, I can't *wait* go hear his take on this thing!" Krugman sits there, goes, "uh", and the audience bursts into applause. 
And he's just so smug. I mean, I get it. He thinks the fundamental value of the dollar is that you have to pay taxes with it, that that's the "anchor" somehow. But there has to be more to it than that, considering sovereign fiat currencies all over the earth come and go every few decades or so, and they all make their citizens pay their taxes with their particular pieces of paper. It's true that the dollar has performed better than some of the weaker members of the pack, but that's only because the US has hundreds of military bases, nukes, naval fleets etc keeping the dollar the dominant economic force. But their ability to finance this global empire is based on the value of the dollar. So it's far more unstable a foundation than Krugman is (so goddamn smugly) making it out to be. And unlike bitcoin, which has been remarkably resilient *despite having no built in advantage like a monopolistic legal tender law propping it up*, the dollar desperately needs people to believe it's stable, or else it will collapse. Kinda like when Wile E. Coyote runs off a cliff. He can keep going as long as he doesn't look down. But as soon as he recognizes the truth, he immediately plummets. 
So the dollar is in this kind of suspended freefall. It's true it is holding steady, but that's because the armed forces and intelligence agencies are preventing foreign nations from leaving the global order. Any that do find themselves dealing with riots, coups, assassinations. Not only that, every other nation is so infected with Keynesianism that they're taking part in this same race to the bottom, as if Wile E. Coyote and roadrunner were trying to outstupid each other.
So in the short run, Krugman and his ilk can have their laughs, satisfied in the knowledge that they're sane despite what simpleminded folk say to the contrary. And their sycophantic followers, desperate to appear sophisticated and intelligent, will laugh even harder, despite being faintly aware that they might not get the joke.
When the economic cataclysm strikes, Krugman will deftly modify his message, claiming that he always knew there was a future for cryptographic based currency, that his insane troglodyte opponents will do anything they can to twist his words out of context. His followers will nod along ("It's true, people *do* do that!"), and be thankful that they are lucky enough to have a Mensch like Krugman on their side. 
You can already see him hedging in his answers, by the way. "Yeah it is pretty nifty technology, but I can't see how it's relevant," or, "sure there are technical differences between bitcoin and the dollar, but come on it's basically the same thing, more or less." Give it 6 months to a year. His narrative will move slightly farther away from derision of bitcoin, slightly toward just dispassionate skepticism, "oh I never said it was ridiculous, only that it was impractical for present conditions. I've always been a huge fan of blockchain technology. Anyone who reads my blog will tell you that."  At some point he will act like this whole anti-bitcoin phase never happened, and only his insane opponents will call him out on it.

Yeah. Even if that happened, it's pretty much a canard on Krugman's part anyway. If you're looking for a reason the dollar is so popular, I can think of at least three.
1. You have to pay taxes with them, like he said.
2. More importantly, they enjoy legal tender protection, meaning that *all* debts both public and private can be paid with dollars (ie a contract that insists on bitcoin repayment is not enforceable if the debtor decides they would rather pay an equal amount in dollars)
3. Most importantly, the whole petrodollar system, which gives the USD an incredible advantage over foreign currencies, and an insane updraft in value. Allow people to purchase oil using another currency or gold, and suddenly the dollar plummets in value. But WWIII would happen before the US would allow the petrodollar to die.

Probably true. Of course there's a lot of wishful thinking there, since if bitcoin did become the new Visa, we would all be filthy rich. Like you say, for most people in the developed world, bitcoin is sort of a solution searching for a problem. It's easy enough for most of us to get a bank account, and from there you can link your paypal/google wallet/apple pay, and you can basically send money to anybody you know without much hassle at all. I could go out of my way to get people to learn about and accept bitcoin, but it's really just easier to use existing systems. And I'm a pretty typical person. So it's doubtful that bitcoin is going to be much more than a geeky oddity for people in the modern world. Sort of like the Linux of payment networks, I guess. 
One scenario in which this doesn't happen is if/when there is a global financial crisis that is severe enough that people fly to the safety of other assets. If bitcoin is positioned well, and all this VC funding we're seeing bears fruit in businesses that can satisfy that demand, I could see it suddenly taking a much more central role in the developed world. If a major currency like the US dollar loses the confidence of a critical mass of the world population, it may never regain it, at which point bitcoin could see a huge rise in popularity.
Again, though, even if that doesn't happen, bitcoin could continue to grow as a decentralized payment network for people in places where centralization literally equals corruption. Or where people are censored by heavy handed governments. Or where inflation is unbearably high. Or where running water is scarce, but internet capable cellphones are ubiquitous. 
Also, even if it doesn't take over the remittances market, it can certainly benefit developing nations by eating into the outrageous profits currently enjoyed by Western Union.

Usage is important insofar as people actually want to use bitcoin to make transactions. I don't understand this idea that in order for BTC to succeed, people need to go out of their way to spend it and then rebuy. It isn't as though gold is worth over $1000 because people are going around spending it. It is worth that much simply because people are willing to buy it for that much. Bitcoin is exactly the same. There are numerous motivations to buy bitcoin. For some, it may be in order to be able to spend it. But there are certainly others who are interested in buying and holding. There is absolutely no reason to encourage people to stop doing what they want to do. The bitcoin economy can facilitate multiple styles of use, and there is value in all of them. 
And anyway, all things equal, the more people are willing to sell their bitcoin (ie, spend them), the more downward pressure there will be on its exchange rate. The more people demand to hold them, the more upward pressure there will be on price. And the higher the price, the more interest there will be (see: every bubble since 2009). So one could argue that the actual best thing for bitcoin is to buy and hold, and to spend only if you truly *have* to, but to make all other transactions in fiat. Then again, I wouldn't be arrogant enough to tell people what to do with their money. Every transaction has a buyer and a seller, and I am humble enough to see that each one has reasons for doing what they do. I don't need to preach to them about their financial decisions.
Now, I agree that more people might be willing to buy in if more merchants accepted it, and more merchants would accept if people would use it more. So there is value in spending in that sense. But at the same time, these will develop organically as the bitcoin ecosystem continues to mature. As that happens, and bitcoin becomes spendable in a greater variety of contexts, that will indeed cause long run increases in demand to buy bitcoin. But we can't gin the market into doing something it's not willing or ready to do simply by peptalking it on internet forums.

Well, I am already buying steadily. But my number one priority financially is paying down debt. So any extra money is generally used that way. But if I weren't already buying bitcoin regularly, and if my debt were under control, and if I had an extra $100 to invest, and I was okay with the risk inherent to bitcoin, then yes. I think right now is a fantastic time to buy.

Yeah, because cryptocurrencies are still in their infancy. Xerox is way bigger than any 3D printing company, but that doesn't mean 3D printing isn't an exciting new field with incredible disruptive possibilities. 
You shouldn't be comparing bitcoin or any other altcoin to established internet services, since they really have very little to do with each other. They are both on the internet. That's it. Anyway, remember why you and I are even having this conversation. You asked somebody else why bitcoin should be considered the most advanced form of money if there are altcoins with arguably better features. The reason bitcoin (at this point) still wins out, is that bitcoin has a much larger network. But it's all within the context of cryptocurrencies, which are niche as fuck. If you want to move the goalposts, sure you can make bitcoin look tiny ("Look at how many people use water on a daily basis. Now look at bitcoin lol!"), but that's not relevant. What is relevant is bitcoin versus darkcoin, feathercoin, redcoin, earthcoin, litecoin etc. These are the competition within the cryptospace, and they have such a disadvantage in terms of network usage that any features they might offer to sway people *in this market* (again, a small market, especially compared to the number of people with televisions) are inconsequential. This is what makes bitcoin the most advanced form of money. Not only does it have groundbreaking features, but it has the largest network of any money with these features.

People don't need to understand, they need a service that allows them to use bitcoin without having to understand it at all. People who do understand the financial system are more likely to be interested in BTC, but it's not realistic to expect most folks to suddenly care about a new, intimidating topic they have never paid attention to before. For most, they will only care about a new system if the old system fails.

Pretty sure it covers all angles. If somebody owns no bitcoin, and they have little or no income, my advice would be "buy only what you can afford to lose." Which would probably be 0. If a person with 20 bitcoin asked if they should buy or sell, I would tell them to look at their own situation and decide. If that $6,000 is this year's living expenses, I would advise them to sell, since they can't afford to lose what they are holding. Otherwise, I have no more concrete advice to offer without knowing them. If someone has a million dollars worth of disposable income tied up in bitcoin, and they dont mind gambling with it, then they should hold, i guess, if they want. Basically, anyone offering this guy more than "glib" surface level advice is either a sheister or uninformed himself. Anyone looking to Reddit for solid financial advice is an idiot, and my advice was the best and most honest he could hope for.

Aside from your rambling sentence fragments that in no way sound biased or emotional, I want to refocus on your idea of objectivity. 


I agree, but you said it yourself: we assign a negative value to the concept of murder. The concept itself requires a human mind to assign it value. If WWIII ever comes and humanity is wiped off the face of the earth, "murder" as a concept will cease to have value one way or the other. 
 It's true gold has objective qualities that make it valuable, but that doesn't mean the gold itself is "objectively valuable." There still needs to be a human mind to recognize that the element gold has useful qualities. After WWIII, an ounce of gold would still weigh an ounce. Its objective qualities wouldn't have changed at all. But we can't exactly call it valuable, either - there's nobody around to value it anymore. 
Another example. Petroleum is a super duper valuable commodity. But before the industrial revolution, most people saw oil as a nuisance. Black goo that gets in the way of farming  etc. That all changed though when the internal combustion engine was invented. Of course, the oil itself didn't change, but subjectively, people began to assign it a much higher value.
What about baseball cards. Objectively they're all pretty similar. Piece of mass produced cardboard with some ink on it. But based on the player's performance, which is totally unrelated to the objective nature of the card, the card's value will fluctuate wildly. People will pay hundreds of thousands for Joe DiMaggio or Babe Ruth, but pennies for some schmuck who stuck around for a cup of coffee. MUST BE A PONZI SCHEME DONT THEY KNOW BASEBALL CARDS HAVE NO INTRINSIC VALUE
So, I get it. You don't like "shitcoin". Great. But a part of growing up is realizing that the world doesn't disappear when you close your eyes. It means accepting that people can like things you don't like without being "objectively" wrong. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 14:04:25
Not on an individual basis, no. But to the extent that bitcoin is adopted, bitcoin users and holders will have an effect. They will have "changed the world." And mocking people for aspiring to do so says quite a bit about a person. It seems that everyone should want to change the world in some way. Otherwise, why be alive?

I've noticed that Circle hardly mentions Bitcoin anywhere on its site. You have to dig into FAQ to see it spelled out. It's conceivable that people could use them to "send and receive money" without necessarily knowing anything about bitcoin.

Yes I was being sarcastic. 
My point of view is that bitcoin's limited supply is nothing at all to be concerned about. First, each bitcoin is divisible to 8 decimal points, so if deflation were to occur, prices could easily adjust. No problem. Secondly, and more to the point, deflation per se isn't a bad thing. Gradually falling prices are the hallmark of a growing economy, wherein the stock of available goods and services increase relative to the money supply. This is precisely what happened during the latter decades of the 19th century, which was one of the most stable periods in US economic history.
I am aware of the ever present fear of deflation in economists and policy makers, but I don't buy it. Steady inflation hasn't brought about stability, as the economy has been more prone to the business cycle under the fed's control than under prior regimes. But just theoretically, one of the critiques of deflation is that it will cause people to delay purchases in order to benefit more from expected future lower prices. While this is undoubtedly true in some cases, I don't see why this is a problem. Moore's Law has been well established for decades, but millions of people nevertheless buy computers and related technology every year, even though they know they can get more bang for their buck if they wait another year. So the idea that people need to be goaded into consuming by eroding the value of their currency is completely wrongheaded.
Really though, there's a deeper problem. The idea that people need to be herded into spending rather than saving betrays an utter lack of understanding of the way an economy grows. The circular flow model implies that dollars sloshing around the economy is the source of growth, making not spending money pretty much pointless. But the truth is that a healthy level of genuine savings engenders genuine investment, which is the source of economic growth, the result of which is higher incomes and consumption. But production has to come first. In short, capital accumulation in the economy is the prerequisite of sustainable growth, since capital accumulation leads to investment leads to better capital goods leads to more productivity leads to more physical stuff produced at lower cost leads to lower prices. The policy lever of inflation is an attempt by bankers and politicians to goad people into spending their money. 
It's because of this misunderstanding of the economy that people think a deflationary currency would be bad for economic growth. It's not. Who it's bad for is governments, who to quote Keynes resent the "golden handcuffs" of sound money. Governments love paper money because they can print up whatever they need whenever they want. Or to be more modern, add zeros to their own accounts. They love the lack of accountability paper money gives them. But inflationary policy is a stealthy way of robbing the population of its purchasing power. It's a modern version of the ancient kingly practice of debasing gold currency by adding base metals, and pocketing the extra gold for the royal coffers. Obviously they don't justify inflationary currencies in this way. They talk about the need for flexibility by appealing to a faulty understanding of economic history. They blame the 29 crash on the idea of gold money,  for example, despite the fact that the federal reserve increased the money supply a massive amount throughout the 1920s, well beyond gold reserves. The crash that followed was essentially the result of the foregoing credit expansion, but most people just look at the fact that gold was involved somehow and assume that was the cause of the problem. This is incorrect. 
So a tldr would be, deflationary currencies are perfectly capable of servicing a modern, worldwide economy, and doubly so for bitcoin, which is divisible to the infinitesimal satoshi.

This simply isn't true. I don't live in a very big town, but if you sent me bitcoin I could find ways to spend it directly on goods and services I actually need. It's still not the most practical, but that is certainly coming.

A lot of people are sort of holding their breath for China to start really buying in to bitcoin. When that happens, people expect the price to rise, and that expectation alone, along with actual increase in demand from the Chinese, would set off a major bull run. So if the Chinese were interested in buying without tipping off markets, they may try to obscure it with these wash-trades, and therefore be able to buy more at a lower price.

I agree with it, actually. The first and last mile part, that is. Bitcoin has the potential to disrupt the remittences market, but first there needs to be a simpler way for people to move in and out of bitcoin, or else bitcoin needs to become popular enough that it becomes feasible for people around the world to use it as their primary currency. Until that happens, it's not like bitcoin is a mindblowing value proposition.
What I disagree with is the characterization that that's a flaw with bitcoin per se, rather than the traditional system it is replacing. So it's really quite disingenuous to say "bitcoin does not make remittences any cheaper", nor did industry leaders say so. Bitcoin certainly does make it cheaper. It's *getting* to bitcoin that can be expensive, and that's the challenge we face right now. But it's an important distinction.

SAR = **Suspicious** Activity Report. Withdrawing your own money is considered suspicious now. This should give anyone, even the most trusting like you, pause.
Lists are not scary in themselves, unless you can see more than an inch past your nose. You think the feds just like collecting paperwork, or might there be some purpose for these reports? I agree the IRS finds these useful, but they'll also be useful during the next financial crisis, when the govt passes capital controls. When withdrawing more than $1,000 will be suspicious. Or more than $100. When you will have to explain yourself anytime you carry cash at all (this already happens above a certain threshold with civil asset forfeiture). This is occurring all over Europe as we speak. To think the US is laying all the necessary groundwork to do the same thing, yet they just won't, for some reason, is precious.

There are other indices that measure such things (the PPI measures the prices of producer goods, for example). But yeah, people make the mistake of looking at consumer prices and assuming they tell the whole story of inflation, which isn't true. With massive amounts of money/credit injected into the economy, prices simply have to rise, whether absolutely or relative to what they otherwise would have been.
@_date: 2015-10-27 14:48:10
Ha. I am well aware of what has been going on. It's one thing to suspect that your web traffic or phone calls are being stored in a government data center somewhere. It's another to have private firms blatantly ask you questions on behalf of the government, knowing they will call the cops on you if you give the wrong answer. It creates a multiplier effect on the threat of "big government." So no, it wasn't the swat team kicking down my door, but it was a reminder of where we are and where we are headed in this country, and why bitcoin is so extremely timely.

Aaaand there it is. 
Aside from the fact that you are assuming there to be such a thing as objective value in the world, I'm curious why you think Bitcoin lacks "it". People value bitcoin, so bitcoin has value. Bitcoin has value because people value bitcoin. I am happy to offer more permutations of this relationship if it will help you.
If you want to know *why* people value it, of course you would need to ask each valuer individually. I'm sure there are going to be different responses, as each human being is unique and values things differently and for different reasons. But a nice guess would be that bitcoin allows people to transfer a valuable asset (there's that word again) instantly anywhere.
What miners do with that electricity is to secure and process the network. That is extremely valuable to a lot of people, which we know since people keep buying the bitcoin token.

Some products are closer to currency than others. Durables, canned goods, bottle water, ammunition, precious metals. These things hold their value very well, and are therefore much more liquid than other non-money goods. So substitute ops example with buying a large quantity of canned goods, and the checkout lady asking why you need so much. Point is, if the company itself required these questions to be asked, you might consider shopping somewhere else, since invasions of privacy are unsettling. But if instead you knew that the government required these businesses to ask questions like this, you might be legitimately concerned. This desire to keep tabs on the everyday mundane activity of millions of people all the time is not the hallmark of a free society.

This is typical. Make some supposedly universal claim about human behavior, and when the behavior of certain humans invalidates the claim, label them as somehow different than "normal" humans, instead of modifying your claim.
Intrinsic value is a myth, a fairy tale told by simple minded people to help them understand complex phenomena. There is only value, which is utterly and always subjective, and therefore *ex*trinsic to the object itself. 
Personally, I agree with you. I value bitcoin largely because it can change the world for the better. But you don't think there are some people who value it for other reasons? Even reasons diametrically opposed to our reasons? We could explain this away by labeling these people as wrong, crazy, or stupid, but guess what, if they are buying and holding, they are affecting bitcoin's price just as much as we are. So what does that mean for bitcoin's intrinsic value? The most you can know about it is why you yourself value it. But if you value it for one reason, and somebody values it for an incompatible reason, who is objectively right according to its supposed intrinsic value? You might conveniently say yourself, but so too would the other person. The truth is, bitcoin's value lies in the eye of the beholder, same as anything else.

I don't think it's you, because I can see your comments still. But the thread says there are 5 comments, when I can only see 4. So whoever we can't see is the shadowbanned one.

For such a big company, Rakuten has a surprisingly bush-league web design. It just feels outdated.

Thanks. Actually, no I haven't gotten around to watching Fargo yet. I've heard it's great. The username (and I assume that episode title) is a reference to a famous philosophical thought experiment. A donkey is equally close to two identically attractive bales of hay. The donkey is hungry, but without a rational basis to choose one or the other, he starves to death. It was designed to be a *reductio* of the idea of moral determinism. I just thought it was kinda cool.

The historical gold standard was a convoluted system of government imposed exchange rates between the various paper currencies, gold, and silver. Many of the problems commonly attributed to having a gold backing should really fall under the category of "reasons why government price fixing always fails."

First of all, OP did invite advice. He asked whether he should buy or sell. So I offered my advice. Secondly, your advice offered the same exact depth mine did. Your summary of my comment was "be smart", and your own comment is "think carefully". What are you trying to accomplish by differentiating the two?

Yeah, I have a massive library of PDF books I'll probably never read. Something about the format (and the freeness, I suppose) means I just never get around to them. But I really want to take the next step in understanding crypto more deeply, and I think paying for it will make it more likely that I'll actually read the book. 
Plus, any small support I can throw the author's direction is a good thing. His talks and podcasts have been really helpful to me.

The Russians I have met tell me that the regular people there have a deep, deep mistrust of anything to do with authority and rules. They don't give a fuck. If they don't know you, they don't trust you, but as soon as they do, they are fiercely loyal.

Still, the longer miners are unable to actually derive an income, the less profitable they are. Time value of money and all. With margins as tight as they are in that business, it's crazy to think people would be *more* likely to secure the network if they had to wait 18 months to get paid.

You just aren't speaking their language. Most people don't use words like spreadsheet, data, cells, array, cloud-based, distributed, decentralized in every day life. If the goal is to explain a new kind of money to a non-techie, you have to use simple words. Otherwise they'll shrug it off and assume it's over their head, even if the idea is perfectly simple.

Nothing has intrinsic value, since value is inherently subjective. What was the intrinsic value of petroleum in 1800, and what did it have to do with the market price at that time.
