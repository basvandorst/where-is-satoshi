"Bitcoin businesses accept bitcoin"
Do you expect all your Kentucky fried chicken to be fried in Kentucky too

I'm not sure but this reads as though the owner is an expat... As an expat myself I know that developing countries high on the corruption index look VERY closely at their immigrants from wealthy countries.. The government sees us as cash cows and we are scrutinised much more highly than the locals who are allowed to openly flaunt the rules (think multiple inspecions within a month on a remodelling I did vs my neighbour literally building a 3rd floor without licenses)
As for "he doesn't break any laws" in your example, regardless of how he reports his accounts (provided the second person arrives as you stated and he manages to cash out that way) if BTC is illegal in Thailand then yes, he's broken the law even if he's gotten rid of the criminal asset.

It's a place for crypto meetups and they're involved in the community. The Thai govt has made crypto's legality dubious. Doesn't warrant changing the business name, associated costs and removing the beacon for crypto enthusiasts

There's a huge difference between taking a financial risk and doing something that, as the owner said, may now cause him legal trouble after recent changes to the law. It's all well and good when you aren't at risk to your liberty or huge fines saying "you gotta take the risk too" but I assume this guy puts his wellbeing and potentially a family's wellbeing than Bitcoin's welldoing. 
Invest what you can afford to lose, why invest $5k that may hit you a $100k fine?

Those services still count as accepting bitcoin. Your argument is like saying well I know crack's illegal so I got someone else to buy it then sell it to dollars which I knowingly received.

My bad, I thought you were saying they saw a 400% gain after entering, not that it had just seen a 400% gain prior to their entry. You're right about them being morons for entering at that point (or at any point ever really aside from the lucky ones and scammers).

400%? Interesting maths, considering ATH of 20k from 12k entry point is a 66.666% gain.
