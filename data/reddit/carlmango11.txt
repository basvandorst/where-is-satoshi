Who is collecting this tax you speak of?

I'm sure nothing like that ever happens in the totally unregulated BTC markets.

Would those products require actually spending BTC? Can't imagine they'll be very popular. We're all HODLing forever, right guys? (Mass adoption imminent)

Oh I was actually being sarcastic, sorry.

How to keep &lt;thing&gt; safe:
1. Create safe place
2. Put &lt;thing&gt; in this place.
It's so simple

And while we're at it Italy should break up into the smaller states that it was made from. Florence needs to take back control of its sovereignty and borders!

The difference being that the vast majority of USD transactions are legitimate. The only widespread use cases for BTC is illegal purchases.

If you remove the transactions that are exchanging currency for another currency then the vast majority of USD transactions are legitimate whereas the same is not true for BTC

Isn't there something a bit ironic about the sign saying "hodl for life" while simultaneously getting people to hand over their cryptocurrencies for a cup of coffee? Kind of gets to one of the core issues with Bitcoin as a functioning currency.

Besides the fact it uses the same electricity as all of Denmark on arbitrary maths puzzles.
@_date: 2018-11-20 08:44:36
Whataboutism. Plus people dislike the amount of energy BTC uses because it literally just wastes electricity by design.

The system is designed to readjust difficulty so that a block is found every 10 minutes regardless of the number of miners.

Go go global warming!
@_date: 2018-03-07 15:07:57
Why do you think usage has increased?
From the [whitepaper](


the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of
blocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases.
And I believe [this]( is the piece of code that sets it

Surely if Bitcoin gets anywhere even close to moderate levels of adoption the network will be crippled?
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:34:34


Yes. Why would you make a purchase if in 6 months time it will be cheaper? Deflation is a well understood topic and it's mostly negative for an economy.
It's possible banks could move to a different more blockchain-esque distribution approach to clearing and settlement but if they were to underpin the system with Bitcoin in its current form it would be a disaster. The system can only handle 7 transactions a second.


Doesn't this just epitomise the fundamental issue with Bitcoin as a currency that I outlined above? I just seems like such circular logic to me. The Bitcoin enthusiasts want to not spend it until mainstream adoption which by definition means people spending it like a normally currency; but no one is spending it because they're all worshipping this "hodl" meme.
@_date: 2018-04-14 19:52:26
This is good for bitcoin

I'm not implying you can get a hold of any key if you try hard enough. I'm saying  generation and storage of keys can be compromised. Plenty of people are careful and lucky enough to not have had their keys stolen.
@_date: 2018-04-15 09:25:06


This is just so dishonest. 
* There are much easier and very commonplace ways to get someone's private key. It happens every day
* Once they get it, all your money is gone with no hope of return
* Banks have sophisticated anti-fraud measures in place
And crucially:
* Your bank will return any money stolen from you

And if the hardware wallet or flash drive malfunctions? I personally wouldn't feel comfortable entrusting my money in a flash drive. Hardware dies all the time.
Think about how often various scams occur online, and then think that if that happens just once with your private key your entire wallet could be emptied. It happens with people's bank accounts and credit cards all the time, the difference being the bank will refund the money. And if Bitcoin does become widely adopted you can expect the amount of effort put into stealing private keys to increase exponentially. There's going to be a lot of activity over on Personally I just don't want to lock up my money on a public ledger where a string of alphanumeric characters is all it takes to claim ownership of the lot.
@_date: 2018-04-08 13:26:34
Yeah just buy it and never spend it. Currency of the future.
@_date: 2018-04-15 15:13:40
Not having a central bank to manage the monetary supply introduces a different set of issues though. As I understand it, Bitcoin is deflationary by nature. There's a finite amount and that number will slowly decrease as people lose access to their wallets etc. If mass adoption does begin to occur the value of Bitcoin will rise even more. A currency that becomes more valuable as time goes on is not one that people will want to spend which is a massive problem and causes the economy to grind to a halt. The reason central banks exist is to tackle these exact sorts of issues.
And regarding your point of having the same sorts of customer services that we currently have only for Bitcoin rather than fiat currencies, I agree. That in my eyes would be the best outcome but it totally negates several of the benefits the Bitcoin enthusiasts talk about. If we had those services we'd still have longer transaction times for clearing/fraud prevention, possibly extra transaction fees and there'd still be a middle-man you'd have to trust. The only real benefit would be that the supply would not be controlled by a central bank.

There are countless ways someone with malicious intent could get a hold of your private key. Malware running on your PC or untrustworthy key generation software are two commonplace ways that spring to mind. All it takes is one slip-up and your wallet can be emptied with no legal recourse. That's not to mention the very real risk of losing the private key. Every backup is a new attack vector.
In any case, who wants to have to go to such lengths just to be able to keep their own money safe.

I'm willing to make that trade-off.
@_date: 2018-04-15 19:46:58
Again, you still have the same risk of malware running on your PC or insecure wallet generation software with the added rick of using a network printer.
Even if you manage to safety print the keys onto paper it's still just a piece of paper lying around your house. Would you leave your savings in cash in your home? Bitcoin claims to be modern digital technology and yet security concerns ultimately tend to be met with "use paper". Doesn't seem very revolutionary to me.

That's why you're not meant to hoard cash. It's a feature not a bug.
