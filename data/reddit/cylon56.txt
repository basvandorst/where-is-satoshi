Boy scout in Texas here. A man could have come in a dress and I would have accepted his business as long as he bought something.

Someone please explain what he is saying? Not sure if it's because he's too stupid to understand or I am.

Unfortunately no one did. Got some nice karma though.

You could also do cash deposits and Western union if you weren't worried about total anonymity.

Did you use a password similar to a password you could have used on a keylogged device?
@_date: 2014-01-06 04:49:09
Sounds great!

That sounds great. What particular subjects would you like me to cover or would you like it to be fairly overall. I'll message you my contact info.

Wow, they have some pricey premiums.

Doesn't sound that retarded. That is a serious problem that bitcoin faces.

If you call them to order you can get FedEx.

Are you in the DFW area

Did you get my message?

Bought some coffee the other day.

I signed up back in August but my account was put under review for verification. My account still shows as under review now. When can I expect contact from someone?
Edit: Mr. Brunner personally sent me a text and got my account up and ready to buy bit. Thanks @_date: 2016-07-01 17:49:27
Warren Buffet is a stock investor, not a currency or commodity trader which are categories Bitcoin falls more closely into. Even if he acknowledges Bitcoin as a good investment, I don't expect he will ever personally invest in it.

The advantages he mentions are fairly pointless and have nothing to do with how the dollar stores value, only reasons why the dollar is be used.
@_date: 2013-12-29 19:20:08
Bitcoin is just as valuable as the dollar in terms of store of value. The dollar is only valuable because people say it the same way bitcoin is valuable because people say it is. The only difference is that bitcoins are created by individuals not a central bank and can't be inflated into oblivion. If anything bitcoins have a greater store of value than the dollar in the long run.
