Same here. GDAX is buggy as hell. If only they had the money to pay for decent developers and server space.... /s

This is cool! But I don't have a printer (because nobody uses paper anymore). Can I trust printing this out at Kinkos or something? Man Bitcoin is a pain in the ass even after 9 years.

Plus...they said it in Tropic thunder, so it has to be true! :)

Awesome, I'm not too familiar with BIP38 encryption but it sounds like the way to go given my circumstances. Much appreciated!

I'm not the biggest fan of Coinbase either, but they were my first entry point. Can somebody quickly explain the pros of using Bitstamp or Gemini? Just curious.

Nice! What a fun comment section to read. People didn't know they were filling this guy's wallet with what is now almost $5k in BTC. Oh the good old days...

Oh wow...that instant clearing is enough reason to switch! For me, that means a lot more than slightly lower fees.

Honestly - I just haven't tried it personally! Care to provide a little more insight as to why it might be a better option?

How is it the better Ether? I'm honestly asking!

There is little chance Bitcoin becomes the norm for small transactions in the future. HOWEVER - I do see the potential that it remains the base for which all the other currencies are built. It already is when you think about it! You cannot (easily) get any other cryptocurrency without first getting Bitcoin. Stretch that thinking out a few years and I see an ecosystem where Bitcoin is used and valued at a macro-level, while a few specialized currencies are used day-to-day for specific use cases.

It bothers me that more women aren't getting into this space! We're experiencing the most exciting tech explosion in almost 2 decades—people are basically begging women to get involved—but they aren't hopping on board. I was part of a blockchain meetup in Denver and we tried working with WIT (Women in Tech) to help promote it but still, only dudes showed up. 
Is this because of STEM sexism? As far as I can tell, anybody with an internet connection can become a player in this space. You don't need to be hired/promoted etc. from a male counterpart.
I'm sure with adoption there will come more interest, but that in itself is disappointing :(

I see what you are getting at. I do, however, feel that despite this new Bitcoin functionality with sidechains, Ethereum is still much more advanced in smart contract functionality. It was built to handle this from the start, whereas what you are describing sounds more like they are creating patches and stuff to keep up. I'd imagine, as a developer working on a Dapp, the Ethereum space seems like a more promising foundation to build your application for the long haul. Either way, I love that I can open my computer each day and have my whole view of this market changed, so I'll likely have a different opinion next week :)

Are you US-based? If so coinbase.com is your best option by far because they have a great track record, an easy interface/mobile app, as well as a good exchange (GDAX) connected directly with their service. You sign up and deliver some identifying info (e.g. drivers license) and link a bank account/debit card to start buying, but it's very straightforward. 
Bitcoins bought via debit are filled instantly with higher fees, while those from a linked bank account take about 5-7 days to be credited to your account. Even if the price fluctuates during this time, you are still given the amount of bitcoins your ordered at the time of purchase. 
Once orders go through, they will be available on your Coinbase wallet or "vault" if you want some extra security. You can keep them here if you want to, but the best practice is to get your own personal wallet (mobile such as Coinomi or hardware wallet such Ledger Nano S for $70 which is what I have) and transfer them there. This will allow you to "own" your bitcoins because you now have them in a location where you control the private key. Keeping them on Coinbase means you are counting on Coinbase to keep track of them for you, and who knows what sort of legislation/hack might occur in the future? I'd rather hold them myself. 
If you want to fly under the radar and get some today, check out localbitcoins.com. It's basically like a craigslist for people willing to sell you bitcoins at a premium (8-15% above market value) in exchange for cold, hard cash. However, you will need a wallet address for this option so they can send it to you. 
I know some people take this all for granted but I've been a newcomer. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions.
