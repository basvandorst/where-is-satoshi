We need more people buying hardware to support the network. It's better than the pools buying it for themselves.

What's the point of this thread?

Realitykeys I think can do this.
Alternatively, betmoose.com has a 2-tiered resolution system that has incentive so there isn't a single point of failure Oracle.

You might also want to consider [BetMoose]( where you can create a bet with any parameters you wish - this could be really helpful to you if you're good at predicting prices at a set amount of time away for example.

I think this was tried and failed because of bots and advertising paying for the space essentially.

Check out  :: it's a user-friendly prediction market that uses bitcoin. This 'truthcoin' thing is like BetMoose but instead of going to a website, you'll be using a piece of software on your computer like a bitcoin client to do the same thing.
