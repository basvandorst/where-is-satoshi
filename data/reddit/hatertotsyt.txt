Shakepay just uses e transfers and I have never had an issue buying. Love them! Haven't tried any withdraw yet though.

I would love to see what the X axis is, assuming it is months. Just to see what this really means.

How far are we away from the lightning network becoming more mainstream?

I find coinsquares fee's to not be justifiable over Coinbase still here in Canada.

NeonExchange soon. Should be an advanced DEX with BTC, ETH, and NEO for trade.

Because you are in control of your own funds not a 3rd party. They are your funds and you own the keys.

I don't know if 8 hours is something to celebrate

Damn my regrets of not buying party hats at 200-300mil a hat are now the same as my regrets for not buying cheap bitcoin

But many other crypto’s settle in far less time, and bitcoin also settles in less time and cheaper when the network is not clogged so I don’t think that’s a good comparison. Lightning network is more responsible than this 8 hour transfer, that’s just very hard to use in every day life.
