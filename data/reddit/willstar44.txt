Is this common that all online casino make your wager 3x, ( without bonus ) just to withdraw... 
I don't understand  IF I walking into a real casino with $100 ... if I forget something in my car, the pit boss doesn't block my exit until i wager 3x 
I understand AML rule, but if your depositing 1 BTC in and withdraw that same 1 BTC  back to the same address or if you have Email them Dox 
what happens if on your first spin you win the jackpot ... you can't leave until you keep playing. 
The reason why I don't like this - you start playing, you lose more than avg and feel like the game isn't fair, you should get the right to walk away.

it looks like coinjar will give out their clients bitcoin cash . Check your email. 
Even though they warn you with email many time you still should have withdrawn your Bitcoin and start been your own bank.

I am getting bored with these spammy post from a Redditor for 4 day 
" I've been in the crypto game for a while " 
then you write crap like 
" I had my BTC on Coinbase during the BCC/Segwit1x fork and still have not received any BCC" 
If you don't have control over your private keys, you don't have control over your bitcoin. IE : you also don't have control over any fork coin like bitcoinCash. 
My suggestion is to stop creating new reddit account, Sell all your bitcoin for any value you can, and either leave crypto or learn and read about it before you invest any money into it.

If you have 5 btc,(worth $20,000) and you short them at $4,000.  
There a number of ways you can short them. 
On bitmex and okcoin, you would open up (20,000 btimex contracts) or (200 okcoin contracts )  
you can short them on margin with Kraken or bitfinex 
they effectively do the same thing.  on margin, you will have to pay margin funding cost, with future you  don't (unless you use bitmex  perpetual future) but there is a set time when they settle, and you will have to reopen them again 
so to make the calculations easy  say Bitcoin goes to Down to  $3000 or  up  to $5000

Now they are $3,000 each &gt; 5 BTC will cost you $15,000. so you have MADE $5,000 profit. ( give or take with minus for interest you paid for margin loan ) . Your balance Would be *5 BTC ( worth $15,000) + $5,000 **USD**. Now you can either keep your USD or buy an extra 1.66.

Go here instead now:
Press CTRL+F and look for "paymentUrls" and in the Bip21 and 72 you can see both the amount and btc address.

there is something majorly wrong with the world when company can losses a large sum of it clients money yet - walk away with billions in profit for it. 
I just wish they recalculated the balance or sold them and paid us out at 1K so at least we could buy bitcoin cheaper. 
If you had 1 bitcoin, the claim should be for 1 Bitcoin and at least 1 Bitcoin Cash
