I suggest you to invest you money in bitcoin, this is spreading too fast and I'm sure one day you'll will be glad that you're part of it. 
@_date: 2016-06-14 08:04:47

@_date: 2016-06-15 08:23:53
Sell it like she said, and invest in BTC.
@_date: 2016-06-14 18:17:34
Use hard wallet like MultiBit HD or Electrum, there's no need for syncing. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 07:51:53
Great, it looks really better than then the last one.

It's never too late to buy bitcoins. If you have possibilities, don't waste them and buy bitcoins and you can hold for a little while.
@_date: 2016-06-14 09:40:25
That's right, sill funny
@_date: 2016-06-09 22:30:19
Don't do it, buy bitcoins with your money it will be better choice. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 07:33:37
Maybe it's some misunderstanding, they should allowed your transaction, it's really weird.
@_date: 2016-06-14 10:52:33
It looks really nice, maybe little dark but good. 
@_date: 2016-06-14 18:08:11
It's individual opinion, I just fine the way it is and how it works.
@_date: 2016-06-14 09:21:23

Why to cure, it's not a disease. For sure it's normal.

Wow, it's really creative. Congrats to the couple. 
@_date: 2016-06-14 18:12:04
The main reason is halving. 
@_date: 2016-06-14 18:23:18
Use wirex.com. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 07:50:39
I don't get. What are you saying with this ?
@_date: 2016-06-14 07:47:16
That's is what I call trolling. You rock. 
@_date: 2016-06-10 07:37:03
Interesting idea, I think I'll hold around 5 coins from, it's not too much, bu maybe in future it will be worth a lot like 100k each.  
@_date: 2016-05-31 19:56:47
Yes you're in profit for sure, but there's not any reason to stop buying right ?
@_date: 2016-05-31 19:25:18
I think around $200 will be fair price, but like you said like a experiment.
