Actually I think he went long with a massive futures buy that expires next week and he needs BTC to hit $18,500 to profit.

When you look at the entire scope, I see your point. But another $9,000 in one year...unlikely. Look at the stock market. It took nearly 100 years to hit 10k

I would love to have it reach those numbers, but I am realistic.

I am thinking of past market performance

Pretty impressive since it can't seem to stay above $1,000. So basically needs to add $1,000 each month for the year...doubtful.

Mentions Linux but not the flavors or if devs were involved. Was this software or hardware?

Gemini is a great and lower fee alternative.

All companies are going to have a few customers that have issues. Sometimes the issue is the customers fault, sometimes Coinbases fault and sometime neither party is at fault and it is caused by outside forces. I'd say 99% of people don't fault coinbase and would continue being cool with them after issues if CB had decent support. Livechat would be pretty badass. A fucking phone number too. I have had 3 incidents over 2 years, one my fault (dropped cell in a lake and couldn't use googles 2FA) Took them 48 hours to have my account restored which was great as this happened on a weekend.
Another incident was with my wife. She used SMS code for the 2FA and the codes CB sent never worked. Every rep on reddit and via email was all gung ho at first. When their method to fix didn't work on first try it was crickets. This went on from August until 2 weeks ago. CB never fixed the issue.
Issue 3: I had a employee signup and sent them 3.x BTC for pay. They proceeded to cash part out to checking account and money never showed up. 3 weeks of CB claiming it was sent and an issue with employees bank. Then out of the blue, CB sends an email apologizing and they would now release the funds, issue on their end.
I am sure all of these issues could had been handled in 15 mins or less with adequate support that would listen to the problem and not reply with a cookie cutter response. Some people actually do check the FAQ's prior to going the support route and try everything in the knowledge base first.

Also NewEgg was just purchased by a Chinese company that also invests in mining operations. They were just a stakeholder in New Egg until 2 months ago. Expect a lot more mining hardware though being sold from Newegg in the coming months.

So basically I am being taxed on in a fiat equivalent for moving cash from the wallet in my left pocket to the wallet in my right pocket and it is up to me to prove I never sold and still hold the funds and the IRS is supposed to believe me?

Did the dude from Home Depot devalue their currency even more?

Depending on when you are looking to sell. Do you need the money back in less than 6 months? I'd avoid. If you plan on staying in BTC for over 6 or 12 months, buy a ton.

isn't this what Craig Wright was claiming and in shit for in AUS?

I bought a computer for 57 BTC. Someone on reddit was posting that we needed to start spending our bitcoin and supporting online etailers that accepted Bitcoin so I did my part. Fuck that guy!
