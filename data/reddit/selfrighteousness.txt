It is very usefull because people all over the world will just look at this top post with this tittle and then in all these internet forums about Bitcoin they will post: LN now has almost 700 nodes.! LN is getting there.
And then everybody will repeat that and they will say: look bcash shills we win we have LN.
SO it's very useful and it's good that this post was upvoted so much. A lot of good bitcointers here understand how important good marketing is. I mean technically we are not speaking the truth but people don't have a problem with that anymore look at Trump getting elected. LyiNg is going to the moon.

ZenBuddhistcoin should be a thing. Their whitepaper would literally be a piece of white paper and their blocks remain empty.

for every private key, there is 1 public key, and vice versa. But this doesn't account for addresses. There are 2*256 public keys, but only 2*160 version-0 addresses, so each address actually represents on average 2*96 different public keys.

Bitcoin's segregated witnesses. With LN watchtowers to look for evil guys like Roger Ver and Jihan Wu. These guys are so evil, you would not believe how evil they are.

I think it's Roger Ver making these posts himself and everybody here is falling for these posts. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 18:14:28
Why are you upvoting his posts then? This post was made by Roger Ver his alt account and he keeps spamming with posts about BCH. Bad publicity is still publicity. There should be a ban here on posts about BCH. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 18:11:32
Well I guess we got to go door to door to let everybody know that bcash is not bitcoin before Roger Ver visits them.

That's the primary reason why we are all here.

BCH is not the end of the world, but BCH supporterts should stop coming here making all these posts about BCH to drive up the price. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 18:10:18
Every new comer that comes to gets the feeling that Bitcoin Cash is the coin that everybody is afraid of. Roger Ver must be making all these posts just so the price of bcash goes up. I mean recently with all the posts here the price went up to over a 1000 USD.
I don't think that the moderators should allow all these posts about BCH because people are just only talking about bcash and not the real bitcoin and bad publicity is still publicity.

Good, then nobody will use them anymore.

Does Bitpay not allow you to make a manual payment to them? Or only over their protocol? 
@_date: 2018-06-08 08:57:28
That's why I support LN. With LN you can finally send pure peer to peer electronic cash without it having to go through a financial institution. And with LN the fees are zero and the transactions are instant.

There are Bitcoin wallet that don't allow you to send a payment to a Bitpay bitcoin address? Good! I am good that there are some bitcoin devs on the right side. 
@_date: 2018-06-08 08:56:12
Bitpay support the biggest enemy in crypto, bcash. 
If bcash wins, the world loses and all hope is lost. 
Fuck bitpay, they have to die and do does bcash. Otherwise it is game over. Hold strong my brethren.

Are there no LN wallets yet that allow you to receive? 
@_date: 2018-06-11 18:24:26
With what wallet can you also receive LN payments? 
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:04:09
Yeah now we can see what the real volume is. Trading the same Bitcoin back and forth a 1000 times a day gives a distorted view in terms of volume.

Coinbase and like minded businesses will make that fork that shall not be named a succes and this is bad for Bitcoin, the only winning move it to boycott all of these businesses and players and even devs, even the ones that made Bitcoin a success to begin win. All a bunch of traitors that have gotten weak hands and want Bitcoin to become useable at the price of being less secure.
