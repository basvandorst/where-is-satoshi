But who is that? That's what I'm not understanding... Are there "people" or companies who actually buy someone's Bitcoins for millions of dollars? And if so, what do they do with it then and where does that money come from? Obviously you can buy and sell it like a commodity but then that defeats the purpose of calling it a currency

That's not what I asked and that's not how real money works.

Thank you very much! This explained a lot!!!
I'm still not sure how or why someone would use Bitcoin over a regular currency but hey all the power to those who do I guess. Also, WTF who is buying all those bitcoins? (Yes I know, you don't actually know who and that's the point I guess)
Question about the value. If 1 BTC is worth $1000 dollars, how DO you buy a slice of pizza with it? I'm sure as hell not spending $1000 on a slice of pizza lol

Ahh very good point! I'll check that out

Except that a currency is something in general use. Bitcoin is a rare commodity that is traded for other goods and services as far as I understand it. Calling something a currency doesn't actually make it a currency (just ask the many countries that tried this with new currencies)

I think what I'm still not understanding is if no one is willing to payout what it's worth (in a large amount) then is it actually worth that amount? I understand people using it as a currency and so on, but if I can't get paid in said currency then what's the point? It's not really a currency but just a commodity

So you have to sell your Bitcoins to other people who want to buy Bitcoin. In other words, it's not a currency it's a product that is then traded for services and itself?

I meant large payout... All I ever hear is people who lose their drives which were worth "millions" in Bitcoin and so on. If it was worth millions, who was it worth millions to?
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:32:30
Honest question... Those with millions of $$$ in Bitcoin, who actually pays you for those Bitcoin? I don't think I've ever heard anyone getting a payout from their Bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:44:52
I'm not trying to make a point... I literally DO NOT KNOW how it works and am trying to understand.
As for the rest of that statement. It is the trust in the establishment that allows a currency to thrive. If you're saying there's zero trust in the BTC establishment then why should someone invest in it?

Question for you. If you want to buy something not in person, how do you pay them with BTC or any electronic currency for that matter?
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:49:51
My interac card is with a bank which is where my money is held.
If you do not use a Bank for BTC how do you pay someone for services using BTC?
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:24:07
Ahhh okay. Yeah sorry the extent of my knowledge doesn't go much further than what I read here. I still don't see it being any less corrupted than what we have now though.
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:06:25
By wallet you mean company who holds that money for you?
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:47:11
LMFAO... You really can't see them as the exact same thing can you? These comments are full of people giving their real life examples of how all the services they try and use are screwing them over in one way or another yet you sit there saying the Banks are evil while these unregulated companies do the exact same thing plus more.
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:35:21
I don't use BTC or any thing like it so I don't really have an opinion really. I don't know much about it, but it seems to me that a LOT of people have been really screwed over with BTC because there's no regulation. And yes I see the similarities in the fact some people get screwed over by banks as well.
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:47:24
Thanks, I'll check that out after work
@_date: 2017-08-16 06:48:30
Oh cool, I didn't know that was a thing. Makes sense really since to me I see no regulation or laws that would stop a wallet company from walking away with all your BTC
