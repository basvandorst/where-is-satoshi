It's trading platform from cex.io exchange.
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:14:47
I wasn't keeping them there, I was using them for trade. Money should work, they shouldn't just be on the paper.
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:46:45
The reason for the post was not to cry about loss. I was not keeping them on the exchange but trading with them. And I lost them because of a technical issue. Reason for the post was to warn other traders about how CEXBRO management resolves the issues. Money should work. This is my opinion and this loss won't change it.
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:30:24
If you are keeping your assets on the paper below the pillow it's your choice. I get used to put my money to work for me. And yes, I was ready to lose these funds, as I stated in the comment. I lost them not because of my mistake, but due to a technical issue. I'm not upset with the loss itself but rather with the service, they don't want to accept their mistakes. Today cex did this to me, tomorrow - your exchange can have "technical issue" and lose YOUR funds. Where will you complain then?
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:51:38
Below the pillow was a metaphor. The hardware wallet is a good choice to store your savings. This wasn't my savings that were part of my liquidity that I was using to trade.

Thank you for this information. Another reason to avoid CEX.IO and CEXBRO.COM
@_date: 2019-07-07 23:19:17
Thank you. As I said my account would be perfectly fine if not that issue. When you have short and long orders, your account won't be closed for a margin call because there will be enough liquidity on your account. (the short orders start generating positive P/L, compensating negative P/L from Long positions). So the issue was that my short orders were wrongfully closed, leaving my account only with longs and with big negative P/L
@_date: 2019-07-07 18:05:52
I was ready to lose these funds when I put them on trade anyway. You probably underestimate how much it cost to handle the case in the court, especially if you are not a resident of the same country. This case can last years, with appellations from both sides. The overall cost can be greater than original loss, with ghostly chances of winning. So the best thing I can do now - to warn other traders and users about CEXBRO.COM and CEX.IO
@_date: 2019-07-07 22:23:30
If you read closely you will see that account was doing ok and I had a positive margin, and I had a bunch of short orders to survive the bottom hit. I didn't say I had the same bug before, I said I had found different issues, and all of them were fixed, all compensations were paid.
@_date: 2019-07-07 20:05:49
If everybody hodled - this mean no movement of assets. No movement - no profit for miners. No profit for miners - they have to close. Miners close - price is going to 0.
@_date: 2019-07-07 22:19:35
I did not expect anything, and I don't expect any help,  except for spreading this information. This post is just a warning for potential customers of CEX.IO and CEXBRO.COM
@_date: 2019-07-07 19:34:12
Thanks, man. It was a part of my assets dedicated to trading only. So no worries. Just stay away from their platforms and be safe.
@_date: 2019-07-07 19:52:50
So your advice is that every trader should withdraw their funds from trading platforms?
Do you imagine where will end BTC price in this case?
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:41:07
Every Investment is a risk. if you read the comment you will understand why I had a certain level of trust into their platform - was using cex.io for a long time. And they were compensating all previous technical issues - related losses. I thought I was helping them to build a better product.
@_date: 2019-07-07 15:27:40
 
When CEX opened trading platform, I decided to try it out. I had already some experience on other platforms, so It was interesting to me to see how a new project starts up its flight. So I deposited some amount that I was ready to lose and start trading.
The first couple of months were ok. I was encountering some bugs and issues, and I was filling reports they were fixing the problems, and sending thanks letters. If I suffered any loss due to the bug, they always were compensating it in full.
Up to 1 of July.
If you remember that night price was going down rapidly. I had a lot of short orders opened and many of them were closed by "take profit" price, with high positive P/L. In the morning when I woke up I checked up the terminal. Not too many of my short orders left, just about 5.5 BTC in orders. Problem was that I had a lot of long orders with big negative P/L, but I was fine because I still had a positive usable margin. Now I just write the log with time:
At about 8:23 AM I decided to remove take profit price, because I saw that the price will go down. I had a positive usable margin at this moment. I was unable to perform this action - the terminal logged me out. When I log in again I tried to remove take profit price again. It wasn't removed. I tried to close some big long positions but they won't close either.
Then at 8:29 AM cexbro team saw the issue and they put unscheduled maintenance mode.
Then during unscheduled maintenance, these positions were wrongfully filled (remember, I was trying to remove take profit price):
8542405198051:01:8621 01/07/2019 08:48 Buy 1.00 BTC/USD10,501.386003590.00518214 8537179198051:01:862201/07/2019 08:48 Buy 0.50 BTC/USD10,519.586003250.00226242 8537168198051:01:862001/07/2019 08:48 Buy 0.50 BTC/USD10,515.786003220.00295306 8537157198051:01:860501/07/2019 08:48 Buy 0.50 BTC/USD10,500.086003190.00326741 8536756198051:01:833001/07/2019 08:30 Buy 0.50 BTC/USD10,600.086003040.00394550 8536767198051:01:830301/07/2019 08:30 Buy 0.50 BTC/USD10,611.986003070.00100855 8544258198051:01:830401/07/2019 08:30 Buy 1.00 BTC/USD10,613.486003620.00444143 8541545198051:01:830201/07/2019 08:30 Buy 1.00 BTC/USD10,605.586003560.00831466
After this, my margin fell below 0, because I had only long positions opened. I could not open new short positions at this moment since my usable margin was negative.
At 11:24 AM they send a ridiculous email saying that issue is probably in my browser. I did, however, what they were asking but nothing changed, because the problem was definitely on their side. Somewhere at this point, I noticed that what I was seeing in the terminal had absolutely nothing to do with the real state of the account. I could see some positions that were closed already in the terminal as still opened.
At 11:39 AM, they sent me an email saying that they finally allowed deposits again for my account. At this point, I could add enough liquidity to the account to avoid a margin call. But I decided that this is unsafe to put any money in the system when it's in a state of a complete mess. I couldn't even make an account statement to give them positions that were wrongfully filled.
At 2:49 PM, they sent a big email confirming that issue was on their side and promising compensation of 0.61 BTC (and no, they didn't pay it later)
At 3:31 PM, I sent an email, with my concerns of that because of wrongful filling of my short orders in the morning my account might be in danger of liquidation.
Ar 4:00 PM, they reassured me that I will get compensation for any additional losses.
At 17:10 PM, I asked them to speed up the compensation process. That small compensation of 0.61 BTC they promised before actually could save my account from liquidation because I would get the additional margin to open more short positions.
At 18:56 PM, they decided to close all my long positions, causing the damage of about: 6.33-1.15=5.18 BTC. At that time price has risen, and I should have about 50% margin cover.
After a week of exchanging email with support, including having conversations with their "Supervisor of VIP Customers Claims" guy (who probably spent more time typing large emails than actually looking into an issue) I decided to share the story.
The only thing I regret is time and effort I put into helping them to build a better product. But "A fish rots from the head down"...
I don't really think they would return anything anyway. But if you want to help - please spread this information.
If you have funds on their accounts - be aware of "unscheduled maintenances", this can cost you money.
Now I wouldn't trust them even one satoshi. And probably will withdraw leftovers IF they enable withdrawals for my account.
Today you can pass by and do nothing. But remember this:
"First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a socialist.
Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a trade unionist.
Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Jew.
Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me."
To end on a good note, couple hilarious quotes from support with my comments:
"we suppose the issue is related to your own browser. Please go to your browser settings, clear your Web Browser cookies and internet cache, shut down your browser and re-open it." (C) Morgan Larsson
\- Sure, that definitely would do the job!
"In addition, the system may become unavailable to you at any time for other reasons - for example, a problem with the Internet, or for instance a problem with Cloudflare which took place recently." (C) George Thompson
\- Sure, or a huge meteorite could strike the Earth...
"If you encounter problems which are the reason you suffered additional losses due to our fault, we always investigate each case and we compensate all the losses."
"We found out that you were not able change the take profit of your Short positions, because at that time the system was already partially or completely unavailable." (C) George Thompson
\- I'm I the only one who can see a contradiction in this email?

Hi, I checked it now. Doesn't look like a good experience for me. It is too complicated.

Today I have made my first payment on Amazon with Bitcoin.  
It took 7 seconds, and I had not paid any additional fees.  
It felt strange.  
I think that was the same experience as playing with the first Credit Card in the world.  
That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind (Neil Armstrong)
I have filmed the whole process:

I was talking about Lightning Network, not about Chrome extension, of course
@_date: 2019-05-15 22:29:45
I bet that less than in 1 year Amazon will allow bitcoin payments, I don't know if they will use same technology provided in video (if they are smart enough and don't want to re-invent a wheel again) or they will come up with their own solution.
