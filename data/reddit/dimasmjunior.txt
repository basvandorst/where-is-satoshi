I think it is because they don't have the necessary license yet.

Bitcoin may be very secure in its crypto, but there is no Operating System or Hardware secure enough to run it.

Maybe we should just leave wikipedia alone. Please take a look at this:
"Wikipedia doesn't need your money - so why does it keep pestering you?"

I like the name votecoin. The problem I see with your idea is that if the criteria to release the coins is the completion of a public work, how is it going to be financed if the coins are only released after it is completed? But maybe you were thinking of other criteria?

Not all virtual currencies are cryptocurrencies.

There's also this: "Al Gore is Satoshi"

You're welcome. I was searching for their donations page and came across that article. My opinion changed too.

Very nice.

The moment you break ECC, bitcoin becomes worthless. That said, thinking about legal problems makes no sense at all.

Wrong. They create money through debt. This is not possible with Bitcoin.

Who enforces the solutions can be selected by vote, the difference is that they can be removed at any time (just propose it and let people vote). If you don't agree with the method of enforcement, propose another method and let people vote.

He gets it terribly wrong. We should start a compilation of videos like this.

What a crappy try.
@_date: 2013-10-14 19:34:00
I agree, it's a problem of representative democracy. We need a mechanism where people can propose and vote directly in solutions, and not in other (corruptible) people.

Maybe that's not a bad thing. This income inequality may have developed through privileges conceded by governments (which may have been elected with money from these very own individuals).
Would people have voted yes for the Wall Street bailout? What about the wars?
