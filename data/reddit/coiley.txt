Hmm, interesting. 
But would it really be that new? Think of computer programs. A CD of Bioshock Infinite is a tangible moveable; a good. But a copy of Bioshock Infinite installed over Steam isn't a good since it's intangible. But nor is it a chose in action, nor does it have a long common law tradition recognising it, nor is it deemed to be property by statute.
And yet, here in the EU at least, the courts haven't seen anything wrong with treating the buyer as having a property right in it (separate from the IP held by the copyright owner) by holding that [it can be resold]( (I have no clue about US law in this area).
So maybe you're right and we are seeing a new kind of intangible personal property that isn't a chose in action, and software and bitcoins are both examples of it.

A large foundation of people using it as an actual currency (conducting commerce in it), as opposed to being used predominantly for speculation.

Not quite true - as the owner of a share in a company, you're entitled to a proportion of the company's assets if it's wound up.
(Of course, in practice companies are usually only wound up if their liabilities exceed their assets, in which case the shareholders, being below all the creditors on the priority ladder, will almost certainly get nothing...)

You'd have thought, but somehow they're doing it - e.g. someone's just in the last 2min sent the visible price crashing from $180 to $121 by filling the recent orders with small trades at that price. A bug in the way bitstamp calculates the price to show, maybe? Unless I'm missing something obvious, IANAtrader.

No-one's actually selling significant amounts at that price, AFAICT. Probably just someone gaming the 'last price' ticker (by selling tiny amounts) to try and cause people to panic &amp; sell, in order to buy in at the corresponding temporary price drop.

The address of your bitcointip account is 18kCrvSdTPJuwKfcQmWu8AUW1ULMWsSekM, yes?
[Looks like]( you sent 0.2BTC to the (valid) bitcoin address 1GadCvsdahxwP7kkxSXERpn28Ru69QsyLg about 13 hours ago.
If that's not what you told the bitcointip bot to do, possibly a bug in the bot. Message and ask him to investigate?

There are problems with the idea of a decentralised, p2p exchange. Transferring BTC from person A to B is easy enough, transferring EUR/USD/etc. is not. Bank transfers can take days to be confirmed. Giving money in person works, but is impractical and doesn't scale. At the very least you need an escrow service to prevent fraud, which will double the bank transfer time.

If everyone stopped accepting gold, it'd also be.. not worthless, but only worth its intrinsic value (for electronics and jewellery), which is a fraction of its current market value. If your definition of fiat currency is everything with an exchange value above its use value, that makes every medium of exchange short of bartering for food a "fiat currency", which makes it a somewhat useless term.

So what? There's no sweet wrapper clearing house to help automate contracts that use sweet wrappers as consideration, like "I'll give you [three sweet wrappers]( in exchange for a single of a song by The King Brothers". That doesn't stop that contract being legally enforceable. You're confusing two different issues.
You can contract for whatever you like. USD, BTC, gold, sweet wrappers, or anything else (that's a benefit moving from or detriment suffered by the promisee) can all be good consideration.


...With great ease, given that the every bitcoin transaction that's ever happened is publicly recorded on blockchain.info. If I have a contract to pay 1.3 BTC to address [1NGsBZ...]( anyone can look at the page for that address and confirm that it's been paid.
But even if that wasn't the case, it's just an evidential matter, and doesn't go to whether a contract is valid or enforceable. It might be hard to prove whether or not I gave you a $10 note, but that doesn't affect the validity of a contract for me to buy a foobar off you for $10.

IANAbanker, but it isn't really, is it. The *notional* value of all derivatives put together may be that, but that's not the true size of the market.
E.g. here's an example of a simple derivative: "In a month's time, I'll pay you £1m x (1 month LIBOR then - 1 month LIBOR now)". I'm betting that LIBOR (currently 0.2%) will go down, you're betting it'll go up. 
Now, the notional value of that contract, which is what that article is counting, is £1m. But neither of our real exposures is anything like that much. Even if LIBOR doubles (very unlikely), the contract's still only worth £2k. So the size of the notional value of the derivatives market is misleading.

Bitcoin addresses incorporate a 32-bit validity checksum. The chance that a random non-bitcoin string, even of the right length, will be a valid bitcoin address is 1 in 2^32 (under 1 in 4 billion). 
A Mt.Gox account number isn't even the right length.
TLDR: the transaction won't have gone through.

You can't chargeback obviously, but what makes you think you can't take issues involving BTC to court, by normal legal principles? There's no magic in a bitcoin where any contract denominated in bitcoins is somehow invisible to the legal system. It may not be recognised as money, but so what? A quarter share of the wheat I grow next year isn't money either, but if I make a contract with you for that, you can still sue me I break it.

...Am I missing something here? To me that seems obviously nonsense. Exchange fees at most exchanges are symmetric - they apply whether you're converting from USD to BTC or BTC to USD. Using the same argument for a transaction going the other way you could 'prove' the exact opposite, that $100 of BTC is worth more than $100. Applied to forex the same argument could be used to 'prove' that any currency is worth more than any other.
Even if some exchange (foolishly) did charge fees only to conversions into BTC (or vice versa), that still wouldn't show that BTC is inherently more worthy than the initial currency, it'd be an artifact of their revenue model.
Just because someone buys $99 of BTC with $100 of USD (or $99 of USD with $100 of BTC), that doesn't mean the two things have equal market value. The transactor is willing to take the slightly loss because it's outweighed by their reason for wanting to have the currency they're converting into.

Why not? I don't see why Bitcoins wouldn't be documentary intangibles. (After all, shares are documentary intangibles, and by analogy 1BTC is an 11-millionth share of the value held in the bitcoin network, kinda).

I'm not sure why everyone seems to be assuming SEPA transfers are like bitcoin, and after they're sent they show up at the receiving end in 10 minutes.
They're not. They can take up to 3 business days. Yes, that means if you (or transferwise) send something on a Friday, it might not even appear to Bitstamp until Tuesday, and that's before Bitstamp process it. (Yes, this seems archaic. This is one of the reasons for switching to bitcoin!)
Yes, UK people, I know you're now used to bank transfers taking only a few hours. That's Faster Payments over BACS, which is UK only. It doesn't apply to SEPA transfers, which is a different system. That's why your deposits to transferwise clear a lot quicker than transferwise's deposits to bitstamp.

"The price" at an exchange isn't centrally dictated, it's just an indicator of what people are buying and selling at. It won't "come back online at $150", it'll come back online and people will start buying and selling at the price they want to buy and sell at, which will be close to whatever the price then is at other exchanges.

If the bitcoin market is fairly efficient, the current market price takes into account the average expectation (by everyone who puts their money where their mouth is) of its future value. 
(E.g. if everyone knows it would rise to $1000 by august, the current price would also be $1000 (or a little less, by discounting)).
In other words, posts which say where one person thinks the price is going are more or less useless, since I can know something more substantial -- where everyone, in aggregate, thinks the price is going -- just by looking at the current price.

It's not instant. You're not selling to the site, you're selling to people offering to buy.
There are two kinds of order. You can put in a 'limit order' - e.g. "buy 1BTC at no more than $100" - which will be fulfilled only if someone offers to sell 1BTC for &lt;$100. Or you can put in a 'market order' - "buy $100 worth of BTC" - which will be relisted every few minutes at the current market price until fulfilled. (Possibly with a time limit, depends on the site). The second way is easier, but risky, since you don't know how many BTC you'll actually get.

That wasn't really what I was trying to get at by citing UsedSoft.
Oracle certainly argued that they weren't selling anything - they were just granting a limited, non-transferable licence to their customer. But the court rejected that and decided the transaction was in substance a sale ([42] onwards), since otherwise, "*suppliers would merely have to call the contract a ‘licence’ rather than a ‘sale’ in order to circumvent the rule of exhaustion*".
Once they decided it was a sale, the exclusive right of distribution was exhausted by the first sale. So UsedSoft doesn't need a license from Oracle to resell it. They can do it anyway, under normal property law. (There was still a licence granted to the first buyer, sure, it was just irrelevant, the licensee wasn't a party. Whether Oracle could have sued that first buyer for breaking the contract in selling to usedsoft wasn't considered). 
Here's the point:


That's why I was citing UsedSoft: that whole analysis relies on downloaded software being a kind of property that can be owned and sold (independent of the property in the copyright &amp; and associated licences)!
So I wasn't saying BTC is a licence, just that it might be this new thing which, like software, is intangible property without being in any of the traditional categories of intangibles.
This stuff's pretty interesting! (For what it's worth, I'm not a lawyer yet, just an English law student. Who should really be studying for exams rather than discussing the legal implications of bitcoins over the internet. Oh well).
