What's a dollar worth? It's the same question. How much X can you buy with it?
@_date: 2019-07-16 03:00:45

Hey Stupid, Call me stupid, but I think it's only inflation that does that.

I believe your semantics were correct. Don't take that shit. If you bought 3 BTC to start you bought your first Bitcoin and buying your first satoshi you bought your first Bitcoin. Just dont say Bitcoins to be cool.

That will never happen. Just like if you keep walking half the distance to to the wall in front of you, you'll never get to the wall. There will never be 21 million BTC.
@_date: 2019-08-09 19:27:48
Why do you think that?
@_date: 2019-06-08 13:03:34
Not yet its not
