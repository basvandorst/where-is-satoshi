There has been some speculation that Tether could be used to manipulate the BTC price but it was just that, speculation 
Don’t think it’s going anywhere, they’ve just got to get their 1:1 with the dollar settled and continuously audited... that’ll come... but selling it off for fiat doesn’t effect bitcoin and selling it off for bitcoin can only support Bitcoin 
That’s just the way I see it... I’m no expert though clearly lol

Lol I wouldn’t be surprised if Bankers were pushing it down... let’s face it who else has access to unlimited fiat to buy in over the last couple years then dump at will... knowing they can just print some more and  ��

Who was it who said (and I paraphrase) “Give me the power to control the money supply and I care not who governs the people “ ?   It was a banker 
The point being, Bankers couldn’t care who is in government, left or right... it’s not where the power lies
Right now isn’t there 12 ex goldmansacks guys in the whitehouse?  “Advising” 
But you are most definitely right... central banks couldn’t exist in a free market... it’s just as well we don’t have one of those ��

I think manipulation is bi sexual... it goes both ways

I think that’s because they’re choosing the colour for their Lambo... 
Agreed, no one cries “Down with this kind of thing!!! You’re pushing it up damn you!!! ”

I’d say governments do what the central banks tell them... they’re calling the shots

I think you’re onto something... dump, trigger capitulation, then pump it (to the moon?) ��

Right now you should be proud to be a hodlr 
Hodlr to me goes far far beyond the price of Bitcoin... it’s as political as much as a lifestyle 
Hodlr is the new hippie  ✌️

I agree with you on all but Ver... I used to have a huge amount of respect for him, I still think the bitcoin community owes him respect for how much he pushed bitcoin from the very beginning... but I do think he’s gone off the rails with his attacks on bitcoin over the last few years... it’s a real shame... I hope he comes good again one day... he’s a tour de force, passionate, visionary but I think he took the wrong path 
And yeah... Jihan... he’s got no soul for bitcoin... just on a selfish power trip... if he got rekt it wouldn’t be a bad day for bitcoin 
He won’t always be the dominant bitcoin miner manufacturer... one day Samsung, Intel, even Apple will be producing miners ��

Yeah I hear you mate and agree... but it’s the sudden drops I don’t get... it was practically flatlining... what triggered the sudden drop? 
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:45:13
Think of the tech mate... blockchain solutions are going to saturate society at every level... all purposeful Blockchain’s pass value... they use a crypto to do this... bitcoin can only get caught up and ride this wave it started �� hodl ��
