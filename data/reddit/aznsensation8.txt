I'm still hoping Yu-Gi-Oh cards to make a comeback. That's where the real money is at. That Mirror Force on my shelf is gonna make me rich one day.

My appendix ruptured and I tried denying it until the very last minute because I knew the bill would be nuts without insurance. 2 days later I leave the hospital with a $50,000 bill and my jaw dropped. An appendectomy is super  common. Could be happening to someone right now without insurance. The American healthcare and prison system are banking off of our pain and suffering. It's systemic evil that make's no sense at all.

Wtf? Just did a quick scan of all the consequences of getting caught with crypto. Holy shit you'd think we're all drug money laundering terrorists. Looks like this will give them free access to all your financial information and seize it, and lock you up at the same time. We're just trying to carry around some money holy fuck government leave us the fuck alone. Fuck every single politician Trump as put in office so far. Fuck you Jeff Sessions.

I can respect a man who uses his own receding hairline as his logo.
Edit: Oh what! My first gold ever. How much is this thing worth and where do I trade it in for some bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:40:42
Right? How the fuck did he end up there?

The hype train IS the value. Just like real money we all give it a real world value. From what I understand we are essentially moving that trust in the dollar over to Bitcoin as early as possible. There is already a predetermined amount of bitcoin that is going to ever be mined unlike gold.

That is the best shirt I've seen in a long time.

Fuck...I put in for 2k when it was 10. I probably would've done 20k if I could.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:20:24
I read an article awhile back where some guys where mining bitcoins underneath a waterfall using the water as a power source and cooling system. So yea apparently some people are not fucking around with bitcoin mining nowadays.

We all do. This we real money we're talking about!

Hey I was in the same situation myself. Sent them an email and they said they were behind. The next day I was verified. Try sending them an email. Worked for me.
