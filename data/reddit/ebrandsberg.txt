You do realize I was just trying to just throw out a few reasons why he may not be able to return?  Also, you can be banned from entering the Schengen zone i.e. "Europe" on many conditions, i.e. a "pronouncement of undesirability", such as the conditions documented at   So yes, he may have been "deported" from one country in Europe, and not able to re-enter any other Schengen zone country legally.

He didn't say he can't afford to do Europe, but he can't go there.  If he was young and into money, he may have gotten himself banned...

No, I'm saying he may have been in Europe partying and did some bad things and got deported.  Or maybe he is a neo-nazi, or from Westboro Baptist Church, or some other situation we can't even imagine.  Just playing Devil's Advocate.

Honestly, it IS a pyramid scheme.  However, the financial markets are making it easier for people to get into the scheme so it is far from over.  It is only for this reason that I got in on the act myself, and will likely get back out after the futures stuff stabilizes a bit.  I use the analogy of shares of stock in a company that does nothing.  It has no profit, it has no losses, it has no earnings.  You can buy and sell shares, and as long as someone else thinks it is worth buying from you, the shares are liquid.  As soon as nobody else is left to buy the shares, they will no longer be worth anything.  The technology underneath is irrelevant to this mad rush, what is important is that it is becoming easier to put money into it, and people are, and thus it will keep rising.

a) I've traveled to 40 countries, I think I know what a country is (and isn't).
b) At least some Westboro church members ARE banned from at least the UK.  At least some Nazis are banned from Europe:  
I'm not saying either of these are cases, I'm just saying there are reasons why someone may not be allowed to fly back to Europe that are other than financial considerations.  He may just be scared of flying as well (much more likely).

So you are saying that there aren't many people who can't travel back to countries in Europe?
