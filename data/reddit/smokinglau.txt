Thanks for your response. I get what you say, but there is still a huge gap between stocks and these funds. The stock market is heavily regulated by several organizations, these funds are not. They can go up in smoke in just a minute. And i have much more information about the stock market firms then these funds (report, news bulletin, history, ...)

To answer this you have to be aware of an important economic statement: the money you earn, is not directly the money that you'll take.
To clarify: 
You buy 100 btc for 35.100 dollar (you bought it from a user/company for a market price).
You keep it the 100 btc and they are suddenly worth 1.000.000 dollar (no one still hurt).
It's when you sell the BTC that you'll get your money. The value has risen (popularity, increased scarcity, a random idiot buying above price,...), but you probably won't sell everything to 1 person.
Now let's be realistic, 1 person will be like you and buy for 35.100 dollar of BTC which means he will get only 3.51 BTC. This is a market price, in this case everyone is happy.
The only person you took 965.000dollar from is the person you bought it from in the first place. If he hadn't sold the BTC to you 10 years ago, he would have 1.000.000 dollar (and probably more).
I hope this answers somehow?

Well this kind of explains the BTC community to me... a lot of wanting, but never give.

Ok so you have great questions, ill answer them by edits because I'm on my phone and I cant see your text while replying. 
Q1: the money comes from me and my investors. 
Q2: the profit and stock change question is a difficult one. In my mind you have 3 scenarios possible.
Btc value rises faster than the stock: problem, call in reserves? By handling short transactions you minimize big value changes (eg if you keep the stock max 1 hour or 2, the value of btc wont have changed dramatically).
Btc value is equal to stock value: no change, profit comes from small fee i would take for investors and operations (reserves get first priority).
Btc value is lower in rise than stock value: lucky for us, good for the company and reserves?
Q3: no big hot wallet will be kept, only transaction worth. So max 10%.
Q4: the goal is actually not so glamorous. I know there is a big difficulty for normal people to start investibg without having to risk a lot. When i was about 13 i wanted to invest in the stock market, i couldnt because of the high fees andy lack of knowledge. Even now there is still a lot of effort needed (papers, knowledge, starting fees, starting capital, ...). I just want to give people the chance to invest their money, even if it is just 1 dollar, with no big starting fees. Edit: perhaps its also a way to give back power to the people... 
Q5: there will be no info about the investments made before they are completed. The investors will only know the style of the investments and some examples. The transaction history will also tell them a lot. I want to avoid copy-catting and too much sharing for non-clients. Dont forget that of it takes off, 1 transaction can really influence a stock price which means bigger revenues for the client. I know it means some trust for their part, but on the other hand i hope they dont start by giving their full fund all at once with the risk of losing everything if we would be scammers ( not saying i am, just saying i like smart investors and clients).
I think i answered everything now?

This looks actually very handy... Here is my link and I'll see later on what else you have on it...

This is actually a year old bot I found for free. it's not maintained and very basic, but today I got my GHS from 7.11 to 7.43.
I believe I'm at a status quo. The parameters do work, but not good enough. It also has the option to use average and twitch, but both I don't know at all... 
You're right about the short end of the stick. I'm just wondering if there isn't a easier option to invest your bitcoins. example an accessible fund that doesn't ask for money before results... (and that can work for small amounts).

Who can fine-tune this EMA bot? I can't seem to find help anywhere..
