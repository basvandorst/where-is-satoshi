Bitcoin Cash is definitely a step in the right direction.  Idc which wins out as I have a very libertarian mindset for this sort of stuff.  May the best coin that competes the most efficiently against the others win.  That said, btc seems to be the defacto store of value going forward for now.

I love how all these people are arguing to sell at the bottom of a crash.  Some people are just allergic to making money.
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:19:26
Same sort of people tend to buy at the top though.  We could be at the tip of some sort of massive crash I suppose.  Sure the Twins could sell now, or they could wait 10 years to sell.  I’m betting that even if we have a massive crash today and lose 90 percent of value, in ten years we will be better off.  Maybe a crash now would be a good thing for crypto as a whole.  
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:33:40
All these replies pitching their next generation blockchains should tell you that this really won’t be an issue going forward.  BTC itself is a store of value but I’m not going to buy a cup of coffee with it obviously.  I’ll use one of those third generation pow no fee coins to do that.

I understand absolutely what it was meant to be.  Yes, you were supposed to buy a cup of coffee with it.  No, you can’t buy a cup of coffee with it now.  That’s just reality man.  Deal with it.  It is what it is.  I was there in 2011 just like you just as excited as you, but things changed.

The police and judicial system has been dramatically overreaching in power for the last 30 years.  The problem is that the constituents they serve aren’t making a big deal about it.  As long as it happens to a small subset of the population and doesn’t affect everyone, nobody cares.  Just wait for basic allowance to kick in.  They will be happy and content, and in the majority, while anyone who actually attempts to build wealth will be targeted by the authorities *and nobody will care*.  This is a major fallacy of our system of government, and it will slowly degrade until the system eats itself to death from the inside much like the Roman empire did.

Yeah I don't understand.  That money should not be theirs to give.  Why is it legal in Japan (and U.S.?) for a financial institution to take money that they have agreed to hold for other people (but not actually own) and use it as their own.  Should be separate.  Legislaters probably never had to deal with it because the governments would just bail out the large financial institutions if they ever got into any real trouble.  
Can you imagine what would happen if any of our large financial institutions went bankrupt and started using customer deposits to pay off bills?   This is just wrong.

Yeah you're right.  As usual I wrote my comment before doing more than a quick look at the website.  They address this exact thing on the security page in their site with:        
We keep some funds online in a hot wallet for faster withdrawals, but we can easily move as much money offline as we wish. If withdrawals exceed the amount in the hot wallet, we're notified, and once money is moved from cold storage to hot storage, withdrawals will continue. This protects everyone. We continually adjust the amount of online versus offline storage, aiming to minimize delays while still keeping most funds offline to minimize risk.
@_date: 2014-03-11 18:00:51
So... You put Bitcoin in a big central hot wallet...  You tip others with Bitcoin, and it stays in that big hot wallet.  What could possibly go wrong!

Man I respectfully disagree.  It is my understanding that the basis of the rise of civilization was rooted in the fact that as agriculture removed the need for a percentage of the population to spend all of their time hunting and producing food it freed them up to become more specialized.  We're reaching a point where if you don't actually want to do anything you don't have to, but that doesn't mean you don't have the opportunity to make something of yourself.

I'm starting to give it a lot of thought.  Maybe something like the transport layer of TCP/IP where the transactions are caught before sending and receiving and given confirmation, delay, and cancellation options.  Could be made so that next generation bitcoin services and applications can be built on top of it.  Just brainstorming a bit.  
@_date: 2014-04-01 20:05:24

I'm not buying anything with Bitcoin until it goes back to the amount of money I bought it for... Otherwise I'm just paying way too much for everything for the sake of using a cool digital currency.  If it does, I'll buy more to use it.  I just find that if I decide to buy some, the next two hours it drops 20-50 dollars and doesn't come up for air for another week.

I think he legitimately expected the price to jump up to 10k within a very short period of time.  Since it didn't, he's depressed.  He didn't really believe in Bitcoin long-term and that's what bit him in the ass.  Sucks, but he didn't lose ALL of his life savings, just a percentage...  Not going to comment on his post because it would just be rubbing salt in the wound.  
I honestly think he is very depressed and upset about Bitcoin not taking off to the moon like he thought it would.  I don't think it's THAT big a freaking deal considering the price is steadily rising again and he'll probably be able to get most of his money back if he's patient.  I hope to God he didn't panic sell at 450 or something.

You'd have to make it open source maintained framework that applications could be built on that encapsulated the data and added additional values to it around that encapsulation.  It would have to vetted and peer reviewed into the ground.  When sending the data would first go through this encapsulation and processing/validation, then sent on to the core Bitcoin client when it was done.  When receiving, it could be given the same treatment before being finally processed.  
I don't know...  I keep hearing that we need this sort of thing before the currency becomes mainstream.  It's kind of like using Armory.  You're trusting Armory to do all of this back-end work and they could probably hijack everything and send it somewhere else with none the wiser.  It would all be about trust.  I would say open source would work and selling it as a framework.  Preferably with some sort of proof of concept service that uses it as well.  
Wonder if some financial institutions aren't already working on this sort of thing.

What you regard as savings should be in the most secure area possible.  Limited spending amounts can go in a phone wallet so that if you loose them, it  won't be much different than loosing your physical wallet.

Guys.  The public pools aren't even the scariest part of this.  If a 51% double-spend attack is indeed possible, then you can bet that a government wealthy enough to invest in the resources or rich entity will eventually attempt it at one time.  This is a huge problem!

Good for those third world countries.  It's really great that people are doing things like this and the satellite concept with Bitcoin.  
FYI some very educated and smart people will tell you it's a horrible idea.  In fact, the more educated they are, they more angry they'll get at you for doing this.  I'm all about education, but I think it makes people more rigid and less creative.  I think it creates a person with a very specific skill set that someone can frictionlessly hire and plug into a high-level job.  They also make for good professors because they have confidence that they are the last-stop when it comes to knowledge about a certain field.  I digress.  A lot.

Cost basis around 800 here.  If I was going to sell at 800 then I wouldn't have had the faith in the currency required to hold these last few months.  I imagine others feel the same way.   I expect it to dip a few times before it hits 800, dip after that a few times, get blown away by some scary news stories and maybe a crashed exchange here or there, but finally take off and prove itself superior and resilient sometime down the line.

I don't think people understand how difficult it is to be poor in the US.  You open a bank account with no direct deposit, you will quickly OWE the bank $300+ within a few months because of fees, overdrafts from fees, and overdrafts from overdrafts.  I once opened a bank of America account with 500 dollars and left it alone for a year and ended up owing a couple hundred.  You don't get paid to keep your money in a bank anymore, you are the one paying for the priviledge.  I can't believe there are so many people who don't believe in Bitcoin here.  We used to be excited about this, but now we're flooded with people who are just here to moon.  There has to be a REASON for moon.  Those of you here just to gamble on margin trading are also in it for the wrong reasons.  Honestly I'm really excited for when BTC drops to 1k and we get a core community of believers again.

It’s not just Bank of America.  That is the standard for all of the large banks in America.  I’ve used several banks in my life.

That seems to be the overwhelming sentiment.  Watching the margin exchanges closely today.  
@_date: 2017-09-10 15:11:27
They forgot to add in margin traders who get liquidated on the flash crashes lolll

The misinformation and confirmation bias is so big on both sides that I really don't have the energy into getting a debate on this.  It never ends well.  I have seen people have the cops called on them here from these things (and here the cops prosecute someone no matter what when they are called).  So no thanks.  Please discuss crypto here.  You literally have the rest of Reddit to hate on Trump with.

I don't know he may be but I trust my own judgement on these things.  The majority of the human population could act as a big neural network and have 86% accuracy on this as some have said but I still go with my gut instincts.  He could be a moron, I just don't feel as though someone with his level of success could be one.  He could be bad for the country and the world and NOT be a moron though too.  That's up in the air right now.

Instead of taking 10 business days to get your cash-out into a bank account, you can spend it instantly.  That’s pretty neat.

That is just half the country throwing a huge fit.  They didn’t think any of this until the day after the election.  Just couldn’t think that there could be a possible valid reason their candidate could lose.  Typical post election shenanigans.  Same sentiment from the right when Obama won.  People thought we’d be a Stalinist dictatorship with conservatives put in political reeducation death camps for 2 years after the election.

Most of them have Correct Think (tm) skills.  But hopefully there’s a few stealth critical thinkers who know how to hide their nonstandard thought process from their profs so their grades stay high.

Use two-factor authentication at the very least and treat it as an extremely high-risk investment and you should be ok.  If you aren't super tech-savvy, Coinbase has a long term vault storage solution that can at least give you a chance to keep your Bitcoin safe if your account gets compromised.  There are off-line wallets, paper wallets, and hardware wallet options as well.  We are in the "money in the mattress" phase of Bitcoin right now.

Yeah I really like Armory and I'm not thrilled about the idea of migrating all of my wallets in there somewhere else.   Let's just hope it gets at least the basic support it needs to stay up to date with the latest versions of Bitcoin core...

This concerns me a little.. Is the US just kind of going to Shadow ban Coinbase accounts so nobody can end up selling their btc and withdraw fiat?

Sell, watch the market go sideways for 2 days, finally just rebuy near the same price, and watch the instant massive drop 2 seconds after.

Btc won’t be something you should spend until it hits somewhere up in the million per mark so that market swings don’t really affect the price when you have $100 dollars worth.

Saw one at the mall nearby.  It was unplugged into an open outlet.  Not sure why they installed it in an area some random passer could unplug it.  I was going to show my wife it works but oh well.

My hands down favorite book of all time (before Bitcoin even) is Cryptonomicon by Neal Stephenson which was released in 1999.  I can imagine that it's been posted about here multiple times.
