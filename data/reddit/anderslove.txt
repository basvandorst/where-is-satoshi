I think its more than safe for me after long days chekcing. 1. there are not any connectionlike as  Wifi/bluetooth/4G and so on. 2. only pass information via verifiable QR code. 3. cannot disassembly until you broken it.4.  support pass phrase , support import private key (I don't see it in ledger and Trezor)
