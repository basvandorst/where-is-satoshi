Why do people keep making these posts...
1. If anyone with even the smallest amount of intelligence knew that there was an upcoming opportunity for them to profit in trading Bitcoin, the last thing they would do is tell everyone else. If they told other people, they would also tell other people and the price would rise before they could capitalise on the advantage.
2. If someone is investing in Bitcoin, and is hounding others to buy in, There is a significant chance that person wants Bitcoin to become scarcer and for the price to rise, this means that by the time you buy in, you're more than likely already too late. This is a very well known strategy for whales, as the price barely needs to rise before they can flood the market with Bitcoin again and then the price tanks. You lose.
3. Don't trust a word anyone says because 100% of the people in this sub can't predict the future, myself included.

You can be around for as long as you want the iPhone's only been out for like 10 years.
I prefer the choice of installing whichever app I want over what Apple decides I should be allowed to do, especially on hardware bought with my own money. If you can't tell which apps are useful for you and ignore the others, then it probably doesn't matter anyway.
If developers are going to iOS first, the only reason I can think of is that they know it's easy money off chumps forking out hundreds every year for last year's android tech.

Well for me personally it's because my android phone can do more than an iPhone, like using Bluetooth for more than just an audio output and sharing 4g via Wi-Fi tethering etc. Or flashing it with a custom rom so I can have root access. Basically when an android phone comes out, You'll see those new features on an iPhone in 2 years time, unless apple decides they're too much like big boy toys for you to handle.
Smart people buy android, and they buy crypto too. 
Apple happily throws NSA their encryption backdoors so if your government ever decide they don't want you to even have crypto, I hope your wallet isn't on your phone.

The problem is that for as long as that is the case, the price will never settle, It will never be acceptable as a store of value or a currency because of that, As the true value of the coin is obscured and decided by who decides to sell their investment and at what price. For as long as it is treated as a store of wealth or an investment, It will never work in it's intended form as a currency, so it won't be able to replace fiat.
If Bitcoin is just being used as an investment rather than a currency, It's effectively a pyramid scheme - some chumps will be left in the end with useless coins worth nothing.

The only reason gold is as coveted as it is; is because people said it was worth something and ingrained that as it spread. It could happen with anything.

People can and have been taught of the dangers of leaving the coins on exchanges. Nobody in their right mind would consider leaving an investment open to theft or loss like that. If they can learn what Bitcoin is, they or the person responsible for their investment can learn how to keep it secure.
I've been using Bitcoin since 2011 so I've been here to see a few exchanges collapse, and they weren't small, Mt. Gox was handling 70% of all Bitcoin trades just before it collapsed.


Well I only recommend investing no more than you can afford to lose, so naturally as I believe in bitcoin, I wouldn't recommend panic selling like that.


There's a difference, the money in your bank account is guaranteed in the event of theft, and if you suffer from fraud or a hack, they will take steps to help you and protect you further. That doesn't happen with Bitcoin because once its gone, it's gone. Leaving money in a bank account is in no way similar to leaving it in the hands of an exchange.


That's an issue which is being looked at in various forms, and I don't think it's a good idea to not give proper advice as a remedy because it's going to be a problem one way or another, unless a scalable solution is created.

the asset's value is obviously zero if the wheel stops and you don't win but you still own that asset forever insofar as ownership is meaningful for assets of definite zero value.
That's not really true, Bitcoin could rise from reaching 0, but you'll never get that roulette stake back unless you instantly win. You can't compare the two, a game of roulette is not an asset.

What is the need for this? People who say they are hodling are really just long term investors, it's personal greed rather than wishing Bitcoin the best, or at the very least, a 50/50 of both. I think it would be detrimental to the health of Bitcoin if you were to make it easier for people to see just how inactive some of the funds are, when people are so quick to say that Bitcoin is not a store of value and therefore it's volatility does not matter. I realise this is not the mindset of much of this community, but I have been using Bitcoin since 2011 so I have been speaking to people using it for a long time. There actually used to be advice given very often in this sub to spend Bitcoin as much or more than you hold it, that is what would make it into a currency. Anyway I felt like this needed to be said but no doubt I'll be at 50 downvotes before you even see it.

The need to give refunds was one of the main reasons they chose to convert to dollars in the first place. They couldn't count on the bitcoin fluctuations NOT losing them money, if they kept it in bitcoin, and the value decreased between the time of purchase and the time of the refund, they would lose money on every single refund they did.
Another reason is that they probably don't have any suppliers which accept bitcoin as payment, so they would have nothing to spend their bitcoins on. The current situation means they have to convert back into USD so they can replenish their inventory.

I honestly don't know how I can make this any clearer, you wait for the price to be at an all time low and buy back in after you sell the first time. You are buying back every bitcoin you sold, your total bitcoins does not decrease, you are just getting them cheaper. Then once the price rises, you sell again, and then you repeat your large sell order slightly below market price.
@_date: 2014-10-02 18:56:15
Most people are probably at most buying into it a little to see where it goes, it may very well go down and stay down of course, but they will have googled it and seen that it's been higher before and think it could go there again. So you maybe get them buying 1 bitcoin if you're lucky, and that's probably only like 1 family out of maybe 10 at best I want to say? so it's really not adding much to the demand right now IMO.

the mining difficulty for bitcoins is high, I'm going to assume that they could get more profit selling them than keeping them to mine with. Not to mention there is no risk once the machines are sold. If the bitcoin were to suddenly plummet in price, they wouldn't make much money, it may or may not happen, it's a risk none the less.

They also pay for every debit they pay and sometimes credit they receive electronically. Businesses adopting Bitcoin would use payment processors or exchanges that charge a fee, so this would still be an issue.


You don't need to hack anything to steal credit card data from the magnetic strips, all you need are some tools which are available on the black market and usually cost about £500 all in. That way you have the data on your computer and you can just sell it, no fraud of your own need be involved.


Banks would be insured against this loss would they not? I think this would also apply to any Bitcoin payment processor in the form of them being potentially hacked. So no advantage to using Bitcoin unless the payment processors don't tack the cost onto the businesses using their service (They have to, or they aren't very good at business).


Businesses migrating to Bitcoin are still going to get screwed over, just by someone else. Most will have to use payment processors who take a cut.

I didn't mean a different method, I just meant it's easy to clone Bitcoin because it is open source.
I understand why crypto-currency works and why it is worth something and also the potential it has to change the way we do things more than just sending money, the issuing of shares for example.
What I don't understand exactly is why people think Bitcoin specifically is worth so much money, hundreds of dollars for a single one, when it can be replicated. When the Bitcoins have all been mined, and the value increases due to demand, what is to say that companies won't just switch to a different crypto-currency? They sometimes co-operate with each other just now for their own mutual advantage, why couldn't they in the future? even better, they could plan it well in advance, and decide to invest in lots of the coin they plan to switch to, then when they do switch, it might increase in price making them a fortune through their own force, many corporations could collude to make this happen no matter how safe crypto-currencies are.
There is no guarantee that if a corporation or many corporations decide to adopt crypto-currency as their means for transmitting money or selling shares, that they will decide to use Bitcoin, as opposed to starting a new one which would be just as easy to implement, or even using an already existing alternative.

Im not conflating anything. The person or group of people involved have a large amount of money stored in bitcoins. None of us know when these were acquired or what price they were acquired at. The fact is some of those are now being sold, I didn't say all, or gradually, or accidentally, all I said was they were selling some, though I would presume purposely causing fluctuations.
Your two points are not incompatible, why they couldn't both be done by the same person? you get in early, the price inflates very fast and suddenly your theoretical $10k is now $100k, but that's not enough for you. You put up a sell order to sell your coins at $95k, suddenly the large amount of bitcoins you own and are selling below market average causes the market average to lower. You sold at $95k, but the price is still dropping more, you've already made $85k profit on your invesment because the bitcoins only cost you $10k in the first place. So now you can buy in when you feel it has reached its lowest for the time being, let's say its $80k, so you buy back in, you now have $80k worth of coins which is the same amount of coins that you previously bought for $10k and then sold at $95k, and you also have the spare $15k (more than your original investment). Then you just wait for the market to go back up again, and your $80k worth of coins becomes $100k again, and then you just repeat what you did in the first place, all the while making more and more money every time you do it.
I could also be wrong, but hey, I'm allowed to have a guess as much as the next person.

no it doesn't. I visit localbitcoins everyday without using a proxy
@_date: 2014-07-22 15:45:41
Well I'm allowed to have an opinion right? Maybe at the point when bitcoin comes into true prominence, people will no longer trust banks, bitcoin arrived just after the economy collapsed as an alternative to storing money with the very financial institutions that caused so much damage. Maybe people won't want to use banks anymore, especially since credit unions are becoming more and more popular.
@_date: 2014-05-22 12:36:34
I agree
@_date: 2014-01-18 12:16:05
yeah something fell, or dropped.
@_date: 2014-01-10 14:43:51
That will only ever be able to happen if the bitcoin stabilized permanently. Overstock probably aren't under any obligation to return the funds via bitcoin due to bitcoins current stance in US law. Its not ideal for the user but you can't expect overstock to risk a fortune
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:57:16
Well that would obviously depend when these people bought in, you are assuming that they bought in when it was high, with the amount of coin they have, they could have bought in a long time ago when it was like $20 a coin. So they post a sell order under the current average, and it goes down, does it stop there? no, it continues to fall, as you've seen today. That means they have the opportunity to buy back in lower than they sold at, resulting in a profit, they then wait for it to return back to higher, and then they repeat. Even selling below the current average, they could still be making a fortune based on what they may have originally paid for it. And then they also get to buy back in at a new low.
@_date: 2014-01-18 09:35:04
they aren't accepting bitcoin, they are allowing people to sell bitcoin and other crypto-currency through classified ads. It's basically like putting them on craigslist or gumtree.

What if when all the Bitcoin have been mined, people just rent them out to exchanges
@_date: 2014-10-30 19:54:40


Sorry I misread.


I thought you were referring to banks having large cash volumes on hand.


Which requires them to use a third party, this time instead of a bank, its a Bitcoin payment processor AND then usually a bank (still using a business bank account due to legalities, also still paying transaction fees to the bank for debits)
@_date: 2014-05-30 14:01:55
Actually its called having an amazing payment system, its a business, its not forced upon anyone, all they did was create and implement an excellent system that nobody else had done yet and people adopted it due to its convenience. Nobody has a gun to your head...

The US refused to acknowledge patent laws for the first 100 years after they won independence claiming they were a developing nation. China isn't the only country to ignore licenses.
@_date: 2015-01-04 07:15:29
Adoption isn't set to move at specific intervals, difficulty is and only goes in 1 direction. Many people who buy bitcoins have never and will never try to mine them. So no I don't think adoption and difficulty are correlated.
@_date: 2017-02-21 19:13:21
Then hide your coins better
@_date: 2015-01-04 15:33:59
that is correct but there will never be a point at which people stop mining, and if it does happen, this entire subreddit is moot.

Thanks for this, now I understand the problem 
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:55:54
It usually is, as it means they can do whatever they like with your Bitcoin. You may want to Google mt. Gox. It's obviously dependant upon how much money you want to put into Bitcoin. As always my advice is don't put in more than you're prepared to lose 
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:21:37
I'm sure you could read any thread in this subreddit and pick up many problems people are having in relation to Bitcoin. This request is rather vague and I'm not sure you'll get the answers you need because of that. Plus it's quite lazy asking people to submit information to you when you're the one supposed to be doing the research. All the information you need is already here?
@_date: 2017-11-23 11:23:35
I think it's just going to have to wait until most of the coins are mined and the reward is so low that most miners will be focusing on processing transactions for profit. Increased competition should mean lower prices.
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:09:27
Yes that's a link to something about Bitcoin core not Bitcoin unlimited. You obviously haven't read my original comment or that last reply properly.
Edit: Did you really not read the words Bitcoin unlimited twice? I'm saying that the miners will have complete control of block size **if it's implemented!** What the fucks so hard to understand?
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:53:03
It stops a few people from being able to make decisions that suit themselves more than the millions.
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:16:12
It definitely has not sailed. Bitcoin is only just coming into its own, not only do people know what it is, they're starting to learn it's not just a pyramid scheme. There's nothing stopping them doing that, but why would any rational person pay them higher fees for a copy of something that already works which isnt even decentralised anymore. The key of Bitcoin core is the developers, that's why any other start up currency has failed to overtake Bitcoin, and it will continue to be the case

Coinbase has control of the wallet, it's theirs so you don't get the key. You can download a wallet onto your computer or mobile device, but it's very important to properly research the one you're going to use. A wallet actually stores your currency, it's not like loading up online banking and viewing your balance. If you lose access to the wallet, the currency is gone 
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:10:46
If big companies start using it there could be mass adoption. There is by design a limited number of Bitcoin. 21 million ish, so once all are mined, the cost will rapidly inflate as demand vastly outpaces supply

The 1991 not giving you any clues in my username huh. I didn't say it was proof of stake, yes there are ways of hiding it, but that also leaves it open for employers to potentially find out about. It's a risk, however small or large.

Jihan Wu is the co founder of bitmain who ~~invented the ASIC miners~~ invented their own ASIC miner. They currently control about 16% of hashing power through their cloud mining platforms. He is a strong proponent of hard forking Bitcoin into Bitcoin unlimited, which would give control of block size to miners. This would be disastrous as greed would lead to inevitable consensus between miners on mining pools and rich companies to keep increasing the block size so they make more money per block. This would shut out small miners effectively taking away de-centralisation entirely, being at the mercy of rich companies.
But McAfee is a fraud and a fool.

Bitcoin is more flexible than Ethereum, isn't there like 5 mining pools that run Ethereum? thats way too centralized to be called more flexible than Bitcoin. Not to mention that Bitcoin may very well be at some point capable of doing some of these things alt coins were created for. Bitcoin development is far from finished.

They dont really have a choice, foreign economies like china and russia have switched to purchasing gold instead of USD. Those countries have also stopped purchasing government bonds from the US I believe. There just isn't the need for as much USD now. If they kept producing as much, it would devalue the currency greatly.

Well I'm asking a question and I was expecting an answer, I'm not pegging anyone. I'm assuming you are of the opinion that increasing the block size and decentralisation isn't a problem since you said it's just fear, uncertainty and disinformation? Which is what segwit2x was about I think if I'm understanding correctly.
So what is it that you think is FUD?

Everyone has seen chips on a motherboard, they are in practically any electronic device we use, I highly doubt that information is going to get lost. The specifics of traceroutes on an iPhone PCB are irrelevant in my opinion. And I see your point but there's no-one living in a first world country who hasn't heard of an iphone.
The point is I am talking about people having the knowledge of it being done, rather than finding a tesla and wondering how the fuck did this come to be, they will know that cars were manufactured in factories by hand at first and then by machine, and if they don't, Wikipedia has that information.

The thing is, with mining Bitcoin, if you have knowledge of it and know how it works. What have you got to lose? When it started, any old pc could have mined probably thousands a day. I wish I knew about it sooner. I also wish I didn't sell my 77 coins in 2011 for £700. Or the 2 coins I sold for £300 about 4 years ago.

I dunno, everything is recorded these days. If Wikipedia alone survived I doubt there's a need for an iphone. Of course all of our data and knowledge that is digitally stored will be moved to whichever technology we move to. It would be stupid not to do so. I also didn't say the iPhone would be on the ground, merely comparing it to an archaeological dig.

Well actually if you think about it; we understand how people died in the dark ages better than they did at the time. That is probable to continue for the rest of time as long as humans continue to scientifically progress.
