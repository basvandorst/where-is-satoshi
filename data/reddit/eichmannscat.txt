Google store of value. It’s either a high-risk speculative investment or it’s a store of value. It can’t be both.

it's a 3 week old account making hilarious assumptions about the price of BTC with no justification, lol
It doesn't even count as an opinion.

yea it seems like OP forgot his first year econ courses.
Thanks for fighting the good fight.

You also can't completely ignore the [four actual functions of money]( and expect economically literate people to keep reading.

If you were actually an economist, you would know that that's not true.

I really don't think anyone should be in bitcoin (or investing by themselves anywhere for that matter) without reading that text, among several others.
...but then there wouldn't be as big of a speculation bubble, and where's the fun in that?

It seems like, to you people, anything other than being a Putin lap-dog makes you a bloodthirsty nuclear menace.
@_date: 2016-12-20 21:22:28
that is a solid line.
I still disagree with you, but it's harder now.

1. wtf is MA
2. Commodities have intrinsic value by the definition of a commodity. In this context intrinsic value means they have a value as somethign other than as money.
For example, copper has intrinsic value because I can make wires with it
....or, alternatively, I could make a solid rod, the use of which would be to beat some sense into people who have forgotten everything they learned in first year.

You know how I know you're old and decrepit? You don't even know how to use [links]( on reddit.
Also, speaking of shit you haven't figured out yet cause your kids only introduced you to the internet 4 months ago: 
 about getting chicks on the internet is the most cringe-inducing behavior you could partake in. You are embarrassing yourself.
idn how I can make it more clear.

....of Arts?


I'm fucking aware of the current understanding of the Theories of Value including the subjective theory. We've already established that.
What *you* are doing is the classic undergrad mistake of an apples-to-oranges comparison:
The [subjective theory of value]( you are referring to relates to the value of Goods and Services. Money, however, is not economic Goods or Services. In my comment, the term "intrinsic" means something different than you think it means, because you are applying a theory of value that does not apply here.
@_date: 2017-04-17 14:55:16


\^ prime example of why I didn't feel I actually needed to provide arguments. You gave up actually arguing a long time ago.




Let me explain something: You brag about your degree while disgracing your claimed field of study. You creep other peoples profiles and talk about getting chicks **on a bitcoin forum**. You talk to your betters without even knowing what an over-earnest retard you come off as.
My guess: You are fat, lazy, married to some vacant whore, and probably don't work in the field for which you studied (I bet you teach highscool). Notice how I haven't had to humble-brag about my accreditations? Probably because I know how cringe-y it comes off as...
If I were you I'd go back and open up your undergrad textbooks and stop running your mouth on the internet. ^^trick

1. This is incorrect
2. If this is how you attempt to explain yourself after 6 years in post-secondary I would seriously consider asking for your money back.
@_date: 2017-04-16 00:50:23
the *real* funniest part, is that OP already conceded my point, I conceded his, and we're friends now.

I took first year econ, thanks.
In the context of currency (backed, fiat, etc) it means something slightly different.
@_date: 2017-04-15 22:55:53

\&gt; doesn't trust USD because it isn't backed by intrinsic value
