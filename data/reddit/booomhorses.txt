Look at what happened to MT. Gox. It is believed it was an inside job. And nowadays I feel at least suspicious when something like this happens. After all, if someone gets away with it, that probably inspires other people to think of it. Even more seedy enterprises might consider it a business model of sorts. In the black market plenty of vendors / market owners ran away with the money. I've read plenty of news about little joints closing up, leaving people on the hook, and allegedly stealing funds..

All these bitcoin disaster stories make me realize how dependent we actually are on regulation. The Bitcoin protocol might not need trust itself, but when you want to do anything else with it, it does. And it seems that its digital nature makes it more easy than ever to scam people.

Ok, thanks for your long reply. Some of the things you said made sense and partly convinced me. Obviously you have other priorities in mind and I suppose you don't mind for fees per transaction as opposed to as a % of transaction.
I'm not "bitching" but obviously complain because I felt not only fees went up but speed significantly decreased. So yeah, from my point of view, it has gone downhill (although your explanations make sense too)
I wonder if hypotetically this fixed transaction was changed into a % transaction, what percentage that would be? You will obviously not like how this sounds because it is not benetial for your interests... But I could also argue that you would be paying MUCH LESS than you paid in taxes hah. So let's say instead of a fixed fee a 1% of the total transaction value with a minimum of 10 cents and a maximum of 100 dollars. Would that make up for lost income? Also make a single tier of priority or make it so miners cannot prioritize some transactions over others? I just think this leaves too much room to manipulation of the fee market and there are many ways already those into the bitcoin business can make money. Otherwise mining would not be such a popular endaevor.. Including more shady reasons like laundering and tax dodging..

@_date: 2017-02-06 20:44:14
Well, I felt miners business was mostly mining NEW bitcoins. I don't understand this animosity and this "if you don't like it gtfo". Back when bitcoin started everyone a bit of an idealist and people praised the capacity of bitcoin to be a great way to microtransact with neraly zero fees and it could even be an alternative to VISA and so on.
But the high priority fee is over 50 cents... For payments under 10 dollars that is more than what credit card companies charge..
@_date: 2017-02-07 02:46:54
Well if you look at energy prices and so on sometimes free markets don-t work the way you think they do. Essentially the miners have more or less a huge cartel since a few huge mining conglomerates control the the blockchain and more or less can do what they please.
I mean I don-t know exactly how they work, but if they don-t like something htey can just say they will start their own hard fork..
@_date: 2017-02-06 20:40:57
I don't know the technical part of what goes on when a transaction occurs, but I felt you did not need to be a miner to process it. For what I read, miners get those fees to reward them for solving blocks.. But aren't they already rewarded with new coined bitcoins?
I just felt perhaps all the big miners were somehow pushing the fees up and taking way longer to confirm ALL transactions but the high fee ones?
I think a few years ago it took like 10 minutes for a transaction to confirm, my last transactions have taken a few hours... With normal priority..

Well, I see how BTC allos the average Joe to make some money. Still, I believe sites like craigslist could have been created today. (1 guy, one idea). As more big players come in, the game will change.
Also Bitcoin will succeed only if governments favour it. Perhaps China and Russia might be in favour of supporting it, since they always play catch in terms of financial prowess with the UK-US.
If it really became an obstacle, regulators can just block it and that's it. It will not grow over a certain point if its illegal. That is why I don't believe in its unlimited revolutionary power as some claim.

As mining  becomes more technical machines become more expensive. In my opinion this benefits big mining groups or institutions with the resources. Just as it happens with fiat currency nowadays. So it is possible that in the future those institutions will take control and governments will pass regulation that might not necessarily be advantageous for the average user.
Wouldn't it be possible in the long term for the developers and big institutions to get corrupt and start printing more bitcoins? In sufficiently small amounts as not to draw people off. And probably when bitcoin can absorb it somehow. I mean, this is what happens basically with the federal reserve, isn't it? They print money and banks are governments take advantage of it, and the 'average user' pays for it through inflation and so on.
If it makes sense its bound to happen. So it does make sense at any given point for powerful mining collective or institutions to lobby for an increase of the offer. Since they will more easily control the mining-power (and voting rights) and they will take most of what new currency is created, while the reduction in the price of bitcoin is shared amongst all users equally, even those that no longer participate in the network and thus have no 'voting' rights.
@_date: 2013-11-12 03:17:59
I wrote in another post my concerns about the bitcoin system becoming corrupted in the future.
There is no reason to assume powerful institutions will gain or at least try to gain control of bitcoin or whichever cryptocurrency comes next. 
I mean, the internet was an important evolution, but the world has not changed that dramatically because of it. I think things might change at a micro level, but at a macro level things will remain the same.
@_date: 2013-11-12 05:19:04
Bitcoin is a bottom up approach. Grassroots in a way. So a few of us start and hope to become important enough that everyone else joins in. We are countless individuals, plus whatever institutions join in.
But at some point a gov't might say: hey, we love this idea. Lets implement it and force it upon people (not force, but if you start getting paid in crytpo-dollars, then you would want to spend them) and then instead of having to convince people 1 at a time you suddenly have 100 million people getting paid in crypto-dollars.
I mean, being able to print money is too great of a thing for the government to let it slip.
@_date: 2013-11-24 07:27:26
Thanks stingy cunt! Now seriously, thanks for the thumbs up! And don't worry, I don't mind the lack of bitpennies. 
I'm not sure it will be as great as you claim, but I still think there might be some room for the use of the term.
Volatility right now is a problem. If someone says: I paid 1 bitcoin for it you don't really know what that means. And if they say I paid 500 dollars for it it doesn't reflect the fact that they paid in bitcoins.

Nothing is too big to derail. 
I do think that electronic currencies are the future, but it is very possible that some large institutions create a consortium in the future to push their own currency.
I see bitcoin as a bottom up deal, while there might be some top down attempt soon enough.
Bitcoin is cool but is peanuts compared to the global financial markets. Many things will happen until the world adopts electronic currencies in lets say 20-30 years perhaps.

Sorry I did not explain myself properly. 
I don't mean that it would be pegged to the dollar. I just mean we would use bitcoin dollar to refer to a dollars worth of bitcoin, regardless of the value of bitcoin that day.
Like saying a dollar worth of gold.
A dollar worth of oranges paid in its gold equivalent.
So intead of paying or buying 0.0004, or mBTC, or uBTC or satoshis... You would pay 10 bitcoin dollars, or 10 bucks worth of bitcoin.

They can buy fractions of bitcoin. Then instead of buying bitcoins we will be buying satoshis. When 1BTC=1,000,000$ then a Satoshi will be worth 1 cent. Perhaps then they can decrease the size of fractions which wouldn't affect the monetary supply.

Ok, I would be interested in knowing exactly how immune is the system to this sort of systematic corruption. When the large financial institutions of the world came to be probably most of the people who were going to be directly benefited by them strongly supported the cause. That didn't stop the system from evolving into something less than perfect. With a minority gambling the system and creating rules that covertly and often undetectably incline the balance in their favour. Now Bitcoin is a happy world because its not important enough (yet) for the big players to join the game, but this might soon change.
What I wanted to achieve by mentioning the Federal Reserve is how in my opinion the Bitcoin structure could become really similar to the one it is trying to change. I still think Bitcoin can be great in many other ways, but its great to asses its limitations.
People started using dollars and financial institutions and still use them because they choose to. Because it is convenient. That does not keep the structures of power to push the boundaries of what is moral/ethical to maximize their output whilst keeping you hooked to it. 
About the last paragraph:
They would devalue it (considering it does devalue: america has been printing dollars for decades and it has taken a while for people to care) as long as what they can mine brings them more wealth than what you loose by devaluation. 
SO if there are 100 btc in the economy and you have 10 and there is a new emission and you have a lot of mining power because you can control when new coins are going to come out, and lets say you manage to secure 2 btc out of a new emission of 10. Before you had 10/100. Now you have 12 btc out of 110, which is more than having 10 out of 100. Thus you loose like everyone else, but you win more than everyone else. You share losses equally, you corrupt the system into benefiting yourself preferentially. 
Sorry if my explanation is not the best. Im not saying it will happen, I'm just saying people will definitely have incentives to do so unless there is some sort of tight control over the developers ability to even try to do something like it.
