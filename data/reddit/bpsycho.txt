The nist recommended parameters for curves are compromised. Not all the Koblitz curves altogether. Satoshi didn't use the nist recommended standard for generating secp256k1 fortunately. He used lucky number 7 and in retrospect it was very lucky indeed.

Its best to set up a wallet from an offline Linux based computer. You should have two wallets one for spending/everyday use and one for cold storage/savings.  If you don't want to go thru the trouble of doing all that just use blockchain.info  with Two Factor Authentication.  Warning if you use paper wallets move all bitcoin out of it when you need to spend from it because paper wallets dont have change addresses.

Fellow Jupiter owner here I can verify If the miner gets below 60c cores will start shutting off and your hash rate will go down. Yes its counter intuitive but Jupiter miners run better when they are hot. I use to put a towel over the vents to raise the temp to get the cores to turn on but they have since released a firmware upgrade to let you control the voltage of each core so i just raise that till they activate now .

Well if the PC you use to access your armory wallet is online you could get a key logger virus that steals your password as you type it in. If you like armory this is what i recommend you do for the vast majority of your coins.  
*  Download [Universal-USB-Installer](
* Download [Ubuntu](
* [Create]( a bootable USB stick With Universal-USB-Installer.
* Download the [Offline Linux version of Armory]( (Click the penguin) Put on a separate USB thumb drive.
* [Boot]( the bootable USB stick you created. Select "Try Ubuntu". (Warning: Beforehand unhook ethernet and/or do not connect to wireless connections in Ubuntu).
* Install [Armory]( from your second USB (Warning: Do not Remove the USB Ubuntu is running on). 
You now have an offline portable armory wallet! PS: Remember to print Backups and encrypt. What I like to do when learning a new system is to transfer small amounts and practice with it back it up recover etc until I know I am doing it all correctly. Depending on how much BTC you have its best to spread it across multiple wallets and methods.  
@_date: 2014-01-07 19:00:19

Cloud mining is a centralized activity that puts alot of hashing power in a small place controlled by a small number of people. You have no say in the decisions that the company would need to make if something went wrong on the network. The best way to support bitcoin is to buy and use bitcoin. If you must mine do it yourself and do ALOT more research its not something you go into lightly.

The fee can be changed by the user at any time. It is optional to include it. Different wallet's default to different amounts. The reason the price has risen per transaction is because the people using the wallets haven't made the choice to change from the default setting. As the price rises more or stabilizes people will be more inclined to adjust the default and fair market value will be found. 
tl;dr  You can change the fee of a transaction to any amount you wish.

The most interesting thing about this is how strange they are acting. Ebay/Paypal is a huge company and I'm sure they don't take Bitcoin lightly because it could one day be a serious threat.
Nice to know these eBay stories have some credibility tho because I thought it was some seriously skilled hackers messing with us.

The hashing algorithm is modular within Bitcoin. Bitcoin is open source so "Technically" this algorithm can be changed leaving Bitcoin unaffected.  (Miners would have to buy new hardware ofc)

Point me to a single post supported by the community that says "Put alot of money into bitcoin its safe". Regardless if someone kills themselves over losing everything due to an enthusiastic text based character someone posted on reddit perhaps that's just evolution taking course.

He is probably talking about deflation being a bad thing for a [keynesian]( based economy theory. Also he has obviously never heard of [Bitpay.]( He would probably like Bitcoin more if he had.

"why am I just hearing about it?"
 Because Is has coin in its name and you cant tell it apart from the other 5000 coin themed business names?

That is insane! This could be a worthy index of Bitcoin growth. Coin desk or TGB should do a write up on it at least!
