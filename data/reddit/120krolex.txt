Like I said there will most probably be a large pump at he end of the year similar to last year. 50k I hope lol

That’s partly why it pumped so much in december.. people poured their holiday gift money into bitcoin for FOMO

Once you pull out that’s when it’ll rise again, is what I’ve found out. The whales are waiting for people to lose hope and sell so that the price moves down and they can pump the price up again. Don’t forget how easy it is to manipulate the price for them. I still don’t believe it is done going down since the effort it would take to move the price back up to 20k would be too much for only 2-3x profit. Whales are looking for 5-10x profit. There will be a long period of silence with this and the dumping will happen in phases, and I don’t think we’ve reached the final phase. Personally, perhaps unreasonably, I believe Bitcoin will have to drop below 5k for people to start panic selling, thinking it’s going to 0. That’s when they will start accumulating until the price pumps even higher than it did in December.

Why are you so triggered
@_date: 2018-05-16 01:16:02
I am waiting to buy in at 5k. Which it will hit soon and I am willing to bet a lot on that. Can’t short on Binance though. I doubt you’d be so mad if I came in saying that I think Bitcoin will moon soon.

Buy the rumor, sell the news. Bitcoin does not follow many economic principles. It’s basically whenever whales feel like they can make most out of pumping the coin, which will probably be around a 2-3k bitcoin

There will **never** in our lifetime be inflation that will make the price of bitcoin in the billions.

Lol you’re high kid, you’re what’s wrong with the crypto world.
@_date: 2018-05-16 03:26:08
I might take you up on that. I personally suspect a 2-3k bitcoin before it hits ATH
Willing to eat my words if I’m wrong
@_date: 2018-05-16 22:49:09
I might wait until ~3k actually, or just buy in as soon as I get my check and short it
@_date: 2018-05-16 02:44:32
Personally I think we’ll be seeing a 2-3k bitcoin by the end of the year, or maybe next spring, until a huge pump comes
@_date: 2018-05-16 02:58:44
Lol fuck off. There is not enough money in the world to make it in the billions. You’re delusional
@_date: 2018-05-15 23:58:43
My point was new money at the end of the year from christmas gifts, new years money, honukkha, etc
