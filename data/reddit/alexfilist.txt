This guy knows how to do things right

Not the happiest moment for Keanu's character though
@_date: 2019-11-27 17:37:19

MJ's been around for millenia, so has human's will to keep predators away so I highly doubt your prognosis makes sence

Don't forget that MU promote Bitcoin as well

You'd be deemed crazy and posessed by demons if you said it like 600 years ago

If we ban them all there'll be like no info at all. There are some unbiased educational channels and I don't think it's a good idea to ban them even if it's like 10% of all crypto video content

Actually all people are born gay, it's just some dna error that makes them hump the opposite sex

So that you could sell them and get a quick buck in 5 years

This is literally what's going on in my brain when I look at dem graphs
@_date: 2019-12-04 23:49:01
This is my pulse when I saw charts on Dec 17 2017
@_date: 2019-12-27 02:22:51
But what if we reach a point when majority will choose not what is actually necessary and useful for humankind?
@_date: 2019-12-29 04:08:44
A little lie is a precursor to tyranny
