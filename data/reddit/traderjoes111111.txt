You're crazy, only reason btc is where the price is is because of silk road, and eth and monero alphabay pumped their prices, as soon as they were implemented they gained hundreds per coin, hell eth went from like 10 to 100 the first week they announced it.
Markets have been a major part of this wealth, they're actually using the coins for hundreds of thousands of transactions a day, that's what gave them worth to begin with.
Bitcoin was a great idea but without the unconventional means that it was used it never would have gained the ground it did at this point, not to say it wouldn't have gotten to where it is but the markets got it there much faster.
Now the drug dealers who hoarded their coins are rich and our homes are paid for and we are driving Benzs n shit when 2 years ago we was driving Honda's lol
Kinda feels like the government lost the war on drugs in that regard doesn't it? Especially coupled with the fentanyl epidemic with a good portion of it coming from markets.

This is getting ridiculous I still have a ticket from 7 days ago that hasn't been answered by anyone I can't afford to wait a week or more for someone to answer my ticket.
My money should be in my account now that 25 Grand is losing money.
If you guys can't scale you're never going to make it binance is going to take your ass over, take some of those Millions you've made off of everyone this year and last year and hire some workers.
I bet it's costing you money right now because new users don't want to use a site that half-ass works

The guy said he's made a lot of money on it you all assume that this is his total amount in Bitcoin and he's never sold any or has any in another place.
He could have cashed out a hundred million and invested it all responsibly he certainly a patient person because anybody that would watch it go from single digits even up to 100 would be looking at cashing out if they were money-hungry in that type of situation.

How about the Tor project and Tails, maintaining anonymity and our rights to it is going to be important.

Well if you really think about it China actually owns the US, anytime you owe a drug dealer thousands of dollars they pretty much own your ass.
Now think about owing someone trillions of dollars, what do we do if they decide they want their money? Or sexual favors? Then all of your children are sucking off Chinese guys daily to pay the American debt!
America....land of the free....and home of the cock suckers... And in China your daughter only has to be 14 to legally suck cock...

Interesting... but nothing we didn't already know, we are aware one person with enough money can manipulate markets, crypto is easy to manipulate as are people.
While you're trying to figure them out they've already worked their way into your mind and know how you think and know their next move to manipulate how you're going to think.

You can own as little as $10 in Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:34:05
100 is nothing lol people that really have Bitcoin make and lose that every second of the day when the price changes

You mean like creating Bitcoin cash to replace the obsolete core coin?
You just proved Bitcoin cash point....a new model that makes the existing obsolete....
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:59:48
Except the 3 to 4 million that are considering lost forever

Not possible.... Bitcoin is still up over double for December..
You had to make some dumb-ass decisions to lose money, in which case you deserve to be left for being an idiot.
Hell I lost about 50k with the crash but it didn't affect me a bit I'm still ahead so how are you behind?

I mean he could have bought those coins at a dollar $10 $100 1000 and made boocoos of money hell he could have bought it 10,000 and still made many millions.
7.25 million profit it's still a great payday especially from nowhere
People don't seem to realize money goes a lot farther in things like that when you have a lot more of it

When I was broke I met a guy like this and did a job for him....2 years later I had surpassed his fortune and he called me, I let him know​just because he was a millionaire doesn't mean shit, your still an asshole that noone likes. Even your wife left you your such an asshole.
Then you're left with nothing but money and miserable because noone likes you and you have noone to share it with.
Money doesn't equal happiness it takes many other things.
