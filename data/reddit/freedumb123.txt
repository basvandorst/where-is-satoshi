Just telling someone that they're wrong. Great counterargument. Bravo.

Tell that to anyone that bought in at $1000. The main reason people are interested in bitcoin is because it's supposed to be deflationary or at least not inflationary. If the price goes down, guess what? People are no longer interested in bitcoin.

My suspicions are confirmed. welcomes posts solely about a price increase and is completely silent when it crashes.
Could this be any more of a circlejerk?

Notice how when the price crashes, you can't find a single post on about it, but when it recovers it's the second on the hot list. This place is just for you to circlejerk about how much you love bitcoin. I bet the price could drop to zero, and you'd all still think that one day it will recover.

Is it though? I've been browsing this subreddit for over a year, and I've consistently seen contrarian perspectives downvoted to oblivion because they contain bad news. This subreddit is not supposed to be about price speculation, but I routinely see posts about upward price speculation after there was a large increase in bitcoin's price, whereas posts about downward price speculation are not welcome.


I don't wonder why I'm getting downvoted. There was obvious sarcasm in my comment. I've had enough of @_date: 2014-11-21 22:00:31
There's lots of posts and comments on about *upward* price speculation.
But thanks, I didn't know about I'll go there instead.

That's called confirmation bias.

Why do posts that are critical of bitcoin and posts related to bitcoin's fall in price get downvoted into oblivion? However, posts like these about bitcoin going up in value, get upvoted?
@_date: 2014-10-14 04:04:26
Uhm... That proves me right... Why are you agreeing? That's exactly what I said. That this subreddit is 'all but silent' when the price falls.

Oh, what a surprise. Downvotes, for an honest question.

No, you're wrong. Whenever the price paid/sold for an investment is taken into account for present decision making, it is considered to be related to the sunk cost fallacy. I would imagine that the OP would be angry because he had bought in at a higher price, and if he/she sold now and the price went up, he missed a chance to recover his prior economic loss. Why else would he/she feel more anger if the price went up rather than down?
However, regardless of what you want to call it. It's irrational to let "anger" guide your investment decisions. If it's not "sunk cost fallacy", it's certainly some other type of fallacious reasoning.
