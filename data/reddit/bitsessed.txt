Potentially great news.....but I'll postpone celebration until Apple specifically names Bitcoin as an approved virtual currency.

+1....I'd trade both/either MSFT dollar GC's or SBUX GC's for bitcoin.

Have to be honest, I'm pretty impressed with the things the dogecoin community is accomplishing.  I'm going to need to buy some and take a more active role.

I received the same error (Error: origin_mismatch).  Pretty cool idea for a site though!

Confirmed,  I traded in a $5 AMZN eGC and received bitcoin for it a couple hours later.  Will be trading in more AMZN eGC's.

There is a picture of a flyer on the thread so I would imagine a bunch of those were posted in the general vicinity of the last known whereabouts of the dog.  I'm sure the posting on bitcointalk.org is one of many online postings attempting to find the lost dog......not a lone attempt.

These tipping threads are making it easy to tell new individuals about bitcoin and send them a link to get them started.  Thanks for doing great work all!!

I couldn't agree more.  The site could use more exposure to attract buyers.  There's actually some decent items for sale.

Can use either to buy with Paypal funds without any verification steps at your stated amount.

Haven't checked you guys out yet; will do that now.
Congrats on 2 years!

Depends on which timeframe you're looking at.  Up almost 16% over the last year.

Why wouldn't the community want proof of allegations?
@_date: 2015-09-24 21:00:29
Oh no one even came close to inferring (yet alone stating) that the fate of bitcoin rests in these patents. 
@_date: 2015-09-24 20:05:03
Would you prefer if Paypal or Mastercard received the patents instead of Coinbase?

I'm not so sure cardforcoin.com is actually paying anything out at the moment.  I submitted a GC in April that has maintained a status of "processing."
EDIT: Order just processed and payment received.

Just for perspective, it took Amazon ~ 10 years to return to its high from 1999.

I found this funny as well.  Reminded me of that episode of Shark Tank where Kevin O'Leary heard how much revenue one of the entrepreneurs had produced in the prior year and O'Leary replied:
"WHOA, you've literally sold dozens!!"

Oh I've had the updated app &amp; iOS.  I just deleted the app and then re-downloaded and still not seeing a tipping pot balance.
@_date: 2015-02-13 02:52:45
Every time I've opened the app since the change to XAPO I see the tipping pot is "sold out."  Has XAPO contributed to the pot yet?
@_date: 2015-10-27 18:08:26
What fees does ATOMBIT charge for the transaction?
