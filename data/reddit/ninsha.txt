So, I've come to the conclusion that BitInstant is a noobtrap.  It really only provides a necessary service to people who are "cooking on high-heat" aka, people that need bitcoins RIGHT NOW!!111uno.  This is because they haven't done their research, and are trying to catch a ride on the gravy train.  Little do they know that between the possibility of a broken transaction, and the higher fees, they lose a lot in exchange for very little benefit.  After you realize that this is a long term thing, and there really isn't much reason to need to instantly have bitcoins, an option like Coinbase or CampBX is a lot more sane.  Just my two satoshis on the matter.
I still think that the ETF is a good thing, because like it or not, it brings exposure to Bitcoin in a time where there is no such thing as bad publicity.

Because they are not a company that is concerned with what their customers think of them.  Not only is it apparent in all of their actions and customer service that I put one shelf above Comcast, but even the recent interview with Charlie Shrem betrayed how oblivious they are of how customer service works.  If I had to guess, they hang out with too many banker-types, who really don't give a shit about customers.

I think that the price drop of the USB Block Eruptors so soon after release is a sign that sales were slowing down, or not up to par in the first place.  Hopefully the price drop resulted in enough increased sales to pump up the dividend for the week...but ultimately I'm more interested in the sustainability of dividends more than the week to week fluctuations.
And well....since you asked...here is an amazing Pasta Puttanesca recipe for two.  Good for date night, or a night on the trollbox.
1 ounce olive oil
1 tablespoon minced garlic
3 anchovy fillets, chopped
2 pounds tomatoes, concassed (peeled, seeded, and cut into strips)
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
6 ounces dry pasta, cooked al dente
1 tablespoon capers
2 tablespoons Nicoise olives, pitted
1/2 teaspoon fresh minced oregano
8 fresh basil leaves, torn into pieces
1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley leaves
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
Freshly grated Parmesan
In a saute pan, heat the olive oil. Add the garlic and saute 1 minute. Add the anchovy fillets, 1 1/2 pounds of the tomatoes, and red pepper flakes. Bring to a boil and lower to a simmer for 15 minutes.
Add the cooked pasta, remaining 1/2 pound of tomatoes, capers, olives and oregano. Toss to mix and coat pasta with sauce. Turn off heat. Add the basil and parsley. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Divide onto 2 pasta plates and grate fresh Parmesan cheese. Serve immediately.

This is where I go to see Bitcoin news. I appreciate the spirit behind what you are doing, but if those posts aren't here, they do not hit the majority of readership, which means that those companies that are accepting Bitcoin would get less buyers from it.

If you think that the fact that you had a successful transaction with them is post-worthy, then I think you should also understand why there is a lot of negativity.  The internet is not a community good at forgiving and forgetting.
@_date: 2013-08-21 16:49:09
It does need a strong Bitcoin market.  
I guess what I mean is that when you look at Bitcoin from an "Average Joe" perspective, the main benefit is lower fee transactions.  
Average Joe is about as concerned with "mining" bitcoins as he is with the minting process of Dollars.
Average Joe doesn't care about all the details of crypto - he just needs assurance from experts that it works.
the list goes on.
What Average Joe DOES care about, is the value of the currency,  and what it does BETTER than a Dollar.  And what it does better (to Joe) is long distance transactions without large fees.
In the future, I truly believe that it will be universally acceptable, but we are a long way away from that.

Most small miners migrate to altcoins, and then convert to BTC.  It's not a bad gig tbh.
@_date: 2013-05-17 13:35:28
The major problem I have here, is that these are essentially being sold in a "Business-to-Business" model.  Big minimum order, and the price is honestly, simply too high for the product.
Their goal is to promote these "group-buys", where people BASICALLY do all of the heavy lifting of managing a  retail operation for them, for free or very little benefit to themselves. 
The inherent problem (that I see) is that the price point has left in an extremely small margin for profit.
That is to say, ASICMINER, and it's shareholders are the only ones actually making money off of these.
If I bought ONE of these for 1.99 BTC right now, I would have  ~$215 fiat equivalent invested in it.  The likelyhood of of a 300mh eruptor EVER earning it's initial investment back at that price point is not very likely.
I'm extremely glad that they have released a product, which other companies are utterly failing to do....but I'm extremely disappointed with the price point.

In retrospect, my success with the BBB has only been measured against bigger companies (namely Microsoft, Apple, and Razer),  however each time I have filled out a detailed claim to the BBB, it has been responded to by an ass-kissing rep from the above-mentioned companies, and they then went above and beyond to make sure that I was happy.  Which is all I wanted in the first place.

Very cool.  I'd love to get involved in mining at some point, but I just don't know when the right time will be.  I guess maybe I'll get involved when ASICMiner puts out their next generation chips in November-December.
@_date: 2013-05-19 03:42:13
Sure. 
So, for most food you have a four hour "serving window"  where it can be in 'open air'.  Typically four hours, after which it must be discarded.
What it mostly comes down to is temperature control, which is of course to control the growth of bacteria.
This brings us to the 'four hour rule'.  As food warms up, it is more and more able to harbor bacteria, and some would argue that after four hours, that can reach dangerous levels.  So the 'stolen' food that has already been out all day (probably more than four hours anyway), is pretty likely already teeming with bacteria.  Is it going to kill you?  Very unlikely.  In fact, the new bacteria in your system would most likely go completely unnoticed, or at the worst experience some intestinal discomfort.
But much like internet security, in situations of legality, you HAVE to prepare for the WORST CASE SCENARIO.  That means that you don't assume that it is begnign bacteria.  You assume that every bacteria infested piece of food has E.Coli, or Salmonella, so it is viewed as a very real health risk.  
To put it plainly - if you mess up your job, someone could DIE.  
I could talk about this stuff for hours, but honestly, no one is going to read my walls of text about food safety and cross contamination and temp control.

@_date: 2013-09-04 18:17:05
Sure - in hindsight you are absolutely right.
But for people who **already** bought with fiat, they are going to continue to mine in the hopes that the price of BTC will rise enough that it is worth it.
@_date: 2013-07-31 12:40:01
Poorly run company is poorly run.
On the one hand, I'm a little annoyed that we still have to point out how bad BFL is, but on the other hand, it's extremely important that we continue to rail them, and make sure that those that are new to Bitcoin don't make a bad decision that could turn them completely away from cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2013-08-20 15:27:48

I don't believe you're correct....from the description:

As someone who used to work for a BIG catering company, trust me, we hate throwing the food out just as much as you hate seeing us throwing it out.  And when we catch you 'stealing' it, most of us turn our heads the other way and pretend we didn't see nothin'.
The fact of the matter is, it's a liability issue for us, and when it comes to open-air perishables like fruit that has already been sliced for a tray, the food banks and homeless shelters don't even want anything to do with it, because all we're really doing is transferring the liability to them.
The long and the short is - it's an insurance risk.  Someone eats the food and gets sick, guess who it falls back on?  The good samaritan.
In my early days working in catering I once had to individually open and pour down the sink 6 cases of perfectly good beer because they were expired by 30 days.  Nevermind the fact that the beer was really perfectly good, but because someone would have gone through our dumpsters to get to them if we had just thrown them away, which apparently would have fallen back on us somehow.  Bullshit I'm pretty sure.
It sucks, but unfortunately, the fixes for it are more expensive to implement than the value of the food, so often times the money is better off being donated.
I've literally watched my banquet staff hold back tears while throwing away tray after tray of perfectly good food.  And I know a lot of people turn their heads the other way when 'expired' food or food after an event gets tucked into a bag or a jacket.
We know it's good.  They know it's good.  But it's a legal risk.
It's a tragedy.  I don't really have much else to add, just thought I would give the perspective from the other side of the coin.

You may be absolutely correct, and there is a good possibility that you are.
Obviously people are going to pump their investment - anyone with a few days following online investing knows how to spot that, and I think that what you've said about people coming out in droves to pump their investment is 100% true.  
However,  I don't think that this is a fly-by-night, any more than when the Google IPO came out, people pumped the crap out of it; and many people made a LOT of money from it.
Is ASICMINER Google?  No.  But I see their potential as being higher than it is now.

And that is why they are banking on the price of BTC going up.

This is another example of adoption for Bitcoin that is not necessarily the adoption we need.  Don't get me wrong, anyone accepting Bitcoin is good news, and should be applauded, but it would be really nice if it wasn't a hacker group....we are kind of trying to dispel that image.

I think that in the long term you are correct, but in the short term, the barrier to entry Bitcoin right now is VERY high, and a system like this has been sought after now for some time.  Those low fees can still be had, but you lose the convenience of instant transactions.  I think that it's a trade off that you have to be willing to make.
Also, many, many, many of us live in locations where local bitcoin transactions just aren't feasable, and the idea that meeting IRL with someone to exchange Bitcoins is our best option is not only laughable in the internet age, but it's pretty absurd when you're talking about a technology as liquid as Bitcoin.

Although I have never heard of Kipochi before today, I am very hopeful that this is good news for Bitcoin, and I believe that a broader range of adoption across Africa would certainly be great news.
I think when the dust settles, where Bitcoin TRULY shines the most as a currency is the ability to be transferred internationally for pennies on the dollar, compared to the ridiculous fees from services like Western Union.

You're deluding yourself though - people have "voted with their wallets" so to speak.  The official price of BTC is the number that it is bought and sold for on the exchanges.  It's a floating number.

These posts are pretty much daily at this point.
Chances are very good that you do not need your bitcoins as "instantly" as you think.  Make a Coinbase account or a CampBX account. After 30 days and a confirmed transaction, you can instantly get coins on Coinbase, not sure about CampBX.
 Bitinstant is a shitty service, and you should not support shitty services.

I'm not 100% what the current legal environment is like for it everywhere, but where I was, it was more or less this: It's illegal to give away potentially hazardous food, which means that no contract/waiver etc will be valid, because you can't contract/waive something that is against the law in the first place.

I think your valuation of AM is a bit low, I think 4 BTC is more realistic as we move forward past "The Summer of IPOs".  Eventually the tried and true will eclipse all of the hype surrounding the newcomers.  Even though it's not a zero-sum game, a lot of people moved money out of AM into these other stagnating or failing IPOs.

Very nice, level-headed analysis.  
In the defense of the original writers that were quoted in the article, to someome who is not entrenched in Bitcoin, the security risks are not as apparent for a lot of people, whereas the security risks associated with something like gold are much more tangible to a reader that knows very little about gold.
What this means is that it is a lot easier to attack the security risks of Bitcoin and evoke an emotional response from the reader; the uninformed reader is made fearful, while the informed reader is made furious.

ASICMINER is probably the safest security that you can invest in.  But you would still have to choose the exchange you go with (BTCT, Havelock, or Bitfunder).
I highly recommend reading up on and on the Bitcointalk.org forums section on Securities so that you can make your own judgement.
For full disclosure: I own shares of ASICMINER.

I love that quote, but I would like to insert the expanded full quote here so that the gravity is more fully understood:
“All warfare is based on deception. Hence, **when able to attack, we must seem unable**; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; **when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away**; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.”

You could do it with penne, but to me personally, it kind of cheapens it because penne seems to be the go-to noodle for casseroles and other mass production pasta meals.  My personal favorite though is bucatini.  Think of a macaroni noodle, but the length of a spaghetti.  They take a little longer to cook, but if you're boiling water in the first place, the cook time on the noodle really isn't that important.

Remember though, just because YOU can't pull money out of MtGox doesn't mean that lots of other people can't.
There seems to be an ongoing movement to make the MtGox price irrelevant, but European &amp; Japanease withdrawals are still going through from what I understand.  And honestly, if you had THAT much money tied up in Gox, you could always just pay the 5% fee to have it removed.
