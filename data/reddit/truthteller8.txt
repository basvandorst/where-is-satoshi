You're under the assumption that BTC will hold or appreciate going into 2018/19, which is anything but certain imo.

Better sell low, that's always a good idea. 
Remind me to chase again when it hits five figures again at the next halving.

I got in at 11.7k. Is it gg for me or not? I don't mind holding LT.

BTC isn't my only crypto holding. I have a few other alt coins I view as the most promising alts. 
At the end of the day, my crypto holdings make up between 4-5% of my current worth. I don't know whether crypto will ever moon. No one knows for sure. But I am confident enough to effectively bet 4-5% of my current worth on it. It's called a calculated risk on on asset class that's still in its infancy. If all coins go to zero, I'll still be okay financially. 
As they say, no risk, no reward.

I mean eventually if it keeps dropping, it's going to get to the point where the reward greatly outweighs the risk and new money starts buying in. It's inevitable if it keeps dropping. 
And like I said, that's a good thing for the next bull market. When people have, say a 3k basis, they're more willing to hold on than say people with an 8k basis who are more susceptible to selling at the first sign of trouble.

Still holding here. Not too worried. I believe it will make its comeback in the next few years and was smart enough to only invest both what I could afford to lose and only make crypto a small percentage of my portfolio. 
Not sure if it reaches its all time high peak any time soon, but do believe it will reach the low 5-figures at least in the next year or two. Everything runs in a cycle in the economy, this is no different.

Agreed this is good LT.  We need new money in the space and people to be able to either get in with lower basis' or average down their basis'.

Other systems aren't simpler. There's really no other system available where you can instantly transfer a large amount of money between two parties nearly instantly and be able to use that money instantly. 
Not to mention cryptocurrency is in its infancy still. Investors, even the ones who decide to invest today, are still early adaptors in this sector.

Just like all those other times when crypto was done forever, right? ����
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:19:07
Literally any amount of money into a financial instrument without a guaranteed return is a risk. 
I'm not in the market to disclose my own personal financials on here, but remember that 4-5% can vary greatly amongst people.

Great, then I advise you not to invest here if that's how you feel ��
