check out wallet.fail

It appears to now be suspended.

He provided a pic, it still didn't happen the way OP describes.

Luckily for him and everyone else, that Bitcoin is permissionless.

Ethernet aside, I'm sure they'll notice the noise and huge increase in power draw coming from one room in particular.

Forget TX volume per block for a second.
Regardless of how many TXs are in a given 1MB or 100 MB block - the bigger the block - the bigger the blockchain growth over time. Which answers your initial question.
@_date: 2019-01-15 10:09:44
But what does it say?
@_date: 2019-01-21 23:33:33
What are you talking about..?
Re-read my comment agian, slowly..

Prohibition has never, and will never work and this includes prohibiting of things on the internet.
People inside of China can still access Facebook if they wanted to, the same will go for Bitcoin.

I just watched the wallet.fail presentation last night, and after watching that I would highly suggest that they would have a field day with this new wallet... Adding Bluetooth, to me, just seems like another attack vector. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 03:43:36


lmfao the fuck.. I can't even read this out loud to make any sort of sense let alone trying to solve it...
Major props to those that understand this, maybe I'll learn one day... Maybe...

You have two options here;
* Take the huge amount money you are going to need to spend on GPU/ASICs and just buy Bitcoin directly instead.
* If you **really** want to be a miner, mine something else and exchange that for Bitcoin.
Good luck.

Fun fact: Bill Gates never said this. 
During the 1990s Bill Gates wrote a syndicated newspaper column in which he answered questions from the public. When he was asked about the saying in 1996 he replied:

A Blockchain is a chain of blocks.
But what Electrum is asking you essentially is, how fast do you want this transaction to occur. The faster the confirmation in terms of next blocks - the higher the fee.
@_date: 2019-01-06 20:51:35
Because of maths.
Let say we have 1 MB block size, after an hour we'd have (on average) 6 blocks mind. So the block chain has grown by 6 MB in this timespan.
Now, if the block size was 100 MB, the blockchain would have grown by 600 MB in the same hour timespan.
This is assuming that all blocks are at full capacity during the observed hour timespan.
@_date: 2019-01-06 20:43:21
Yes. Block size directly impacts the total blockchain growth over time.

A lot of the negative comments to do with the exchanges are usually due to the user breaking ToS or doing stupid shit.
To my knowledge Coinbase has not suffered any hacks, but in saying that everything is watertight until it isn't.
Just buy your Bitcoin, then withdrawal to your own wallet.
@_date: 2019-01-07 04:28:06
It's probably the safest providing you don't break any of their copious terms and conditions.
In saying that, don't leave your coin on there too long. Buy your Bitcoin and send it to your own wallet.
@_date: 2019-01-21 22:40:34
Now you're just shifting the goalposts...
First you said the Nano **Protocol** was to blame, and I countered with the fact that Bitcoin **Protocol** has also sufferered it's fair share of hacks, bugs and exposures. 
Now your stating the Bitcoin blockchain has never been hacked, well no shit sherlock. Neither was the Nano blockchain.
@_date: 2019-01-21 20:00:59
Do people still trust Bitcoin after all its hacks, bugs and exposures? What about after its 20th? 40th? Not including exchange thefts. Yes we all seem to trust it still.
@_date: 2019-01-22 01:21:58
Why in the fuck are you still talking about Blockchain hacks... Neither the Bitcoin nor Nano blockchains were hacked, ever, nor did I state such a thing. 
You are the only person in the thread talking about blockchain hacks - when your initial bullshit comment were all about **Protocols**. Blockchain =/= Protocol. jfc.
@_date: 2019-01-22 03:19:20
Neither. Don't use paper wallets.
But if you absolutley want to use one - at least use the one where address is spelt correct - and use it offline.
@_date: 2019-01-07 22:21:32


No thanks, I don't trust nor do I need a 3rd party bringing any trust - I verify, and I also hold my own keys.  


So its going to be a middleman in a p2p network?  
Am I excited? No - Unless I'm really missing something here?

We get a lot of this in our company email accounts, the Bitcoin addresses are always different even for the same recipient if we get multiple emails. I guess they know not to reuse addresses.
Education and prevention is the only way to combat these types of scams.

Whether you think it is nonexistent or not, it still meets your listed criteria.
@_date: 2019-01-16 03:13:18


Sorry, you have long missed the boat to mine on a laptop. It would take 100's if not 1000's of years for you mine enough using a laptop just to cover the withdrawal fee from whatever pool you were looking at.

@_date: 2019-01-07 22:23:57
Exactly, I don't know why quite a few people are jumping up and down thinking this will get us to the moon.. This is just further steps away from the fundamentals of what Bitcoin is.
@_date: 2019-01-19 23:37:17
Pretty sure Bitcoin been down before. Once in 2010 and again in 2013.
Still, having an uptime of 99.98% over ten years is still impressive.

Which version of which dictionary of which year of publication would have been chosen, and every type of wallet would need to use that exact copy? 
There needs to be a set of words that every wallet can refer to, therefore making the same seed valid on a lot of other wallets. This is BIP39. Here's an [interactive site]( to play around in. **Do not put your personal seed words in here.**
With a 24 word seed phrase there would be 2048^(24) combinations, that is far more combinations than we'd ever need.

With Samourai Wallet, you are 100% in control on your own keys. Their servers in no way, at any time, know you keys nor your seed.
