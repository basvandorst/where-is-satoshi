Your post encouraged me to make a video on my youtube channel. I mentioned this post in it. Hope it helps!

This is incredible! Thank you for taking the time to help others.

It is. I make that mistake all the time. After a while I just forget where it's at

I love people that make assumptions before even watching. If you had any actual positive criticism, I might take it into consideration.

I clearly know who he is... I just couldn't remember his name. It's been years since I looked up his work that he did on reusable PoW. You're telling me that you remember every devs name that has ever worked on Bitcoin's code?

Hahaha. I have an actual show in my house. Sometimes I'm at work on break and come across something really interesting that I want to share. Sorry if it's not your cup of tea. There are plenty other shows on YouTube for you to watch.

Is anyone really an expert, when it comes to Bitcoin or blockchains in general?

He's a huge deal. Reusable proof of work is the main problem that all programmers ran into before him. I wasn't trying to disrespect his legacy in anyway. I apologise if it came off that way.

You da real MVP.

I've been investing in Bitcoin since 2012. You can view my bitcointalk account or my emails from mt gox if you want to discuss experience. I'm sure coming into crypto in the 2016/2017 craze makes you feel like an oldtimer with tons of knowledge but guess what? You're just like the rest of us. You're here to make a profit. Anyone that says they're here for "the technology" is full of shit. Keep making yourself look like an idiot. Maybe next time you'll do a little research on the people you try to shame online.

Okay, keyboard warrior. At least I put myself out there. It must be hard for you to type out all of these shitty words.

Redditor for 4 days, eh? Don't ever come back. No please. No thank you.

How could anyone take you seriously, with the way you type? Are you a middle-school-aged girl?
