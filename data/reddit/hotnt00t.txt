Lol. Good one

I fully support that strategy. I myself ignored the price from 2014 to November last year. Since then I’ve been obsessing and checking to much. Not healthy.
If you understand the tech and believe in every aspect of this possible revolution and new store of value. Hold!
Bitcoin is finished mining in 2014, that’s quite crazy. The US has piles of debt, the whole euro zone isn’t looking to good. I would say there is a huge upside for us all
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:30:24
Indeed. This is fake news! 
@_date: 2018-02-21 11:23:33
So, Im going to buy a second hand pc to set this up and contribute! I have a 1gb fiber connection so bandwidth is no problem.
1. Set up a full node, no BTC in it, but I will be contributing to the decentralisation.
2. Full archive node. Is this a separate thing or can I do it in the bitcoin client?
Regard the node n00000b

You seem to know what your talking about! If I run a full node without any BTC in my wallet. In what way do I then contribute? And what is the difference in terms of contribution with a wallet with BTC versus a wallet without BTC?
@_date: 2018-03-28 00:14:50
Nice post. This site is great. This news is actually huge but it impact the USD very slowly. China is positioning themselves and have a great position to do so

Kraken works great for me!
@_date: 2018-03-14 03:04:00
FUD. Kraken works perfectly and support is great. There must be some detail you are forgetting to mention here
@_date: 2018-03-25 20:44:58
Nice man!
I have bad experience from trading, basically I don’t know what I’m doing :p 
Do you follow any sort of strategy or have advice on where to learn? Would be cool to use a small BTC amount and try to increase it.
@_date: 2018-02-18 19:56:35
So what! Good for him and good for BTC 
@_date: 2018-03-27 11:18:42
Leave the man alone. He’s smart, if you don’t use your car a lot, making 200 bucks a day on renting it out is nice. Imagine, he can buy the dip with that extra money. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 00:05:39
So how does this work in theory? I know I can send someone BTC and include a message. But links and fcking porn? 
I’m a rookie and would think that getting access to such things are quite complex?
Is this a threat to BTC? One thing is a 51% attack another is the Blockchain being flooded with illegal content 
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:24:28
And the cartel guys launder their money. So after washing it they are also “regulars”
I must admit that I’m curious about the “bad guys” and if they are diversifying their portfolios into crypto. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 02:30:46
Nice, thanks!
@_date: 2018-02-09 23:43:15
This guy isn’t as stupid as he looks. This whole statement is very seductive for the audience! Don’t you see the patterns of his sociopath like behaviour 
@_date: 2018-03-19 13:17:08
@_date: 2018-03-23 19:43:17
That is correct sir 
@_date: 2018-03-20 20:54:57
I have great experience with kraken! I’m sorry for your situation and hope it gets resolved. My gut feeling is that he is raising some red flags and that the documents not being sufficient.  KYC and AML is strict as hell! Have you tried helping him with the documents? 
@_date: 2018-03-24 12:41:15
Unhook from internet and make a backup of the wallet to a thumb drive 
@_date: 2018-03-27 01:01:34
Do it OTC over a number of various exchanges. The services work fine and you can minimise your paranoia by doing so!
@_date: 2018-03-26 11:43:56
What u mean
@_date: 2018-03-23 23:03:37
Congratulations and Fantastic!

Sounds like he’s gonna start a sect
@_date: 2018-02-21 11:24:26
And in regards of a watch only. What difference would that make from not adding it?
@_date: 2018-03-25 02:28:09
Great man. Welcome 
@_date: 2018-03-24 12:37:57
@_date: 2018-03-24 22:51:27
How much if I can ask? 
@_date: 2018-03-26 12:27:56
The cartel are the ones with huge money. Crypto needs the cartel! 
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:30:02
FAKE NEWS! 
@_date: 2018-03-24 23:27:11
Curiosity Sir 
@_date: 2018-03-24 23:26:41
Awesome 
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:14:32
Very cool indeed! Know a lot of HODLERS in Canada?
@_date: 2018-02-09 23:31:14
Wow! Great place to start! A lot of foreign money on that island and region! Tax haven money...
@_date: 2018-03-24 21:54:06
@_date: 2018-03-28 00:16:40
Lol wtf
@_date: 2018-03-19 16:55:21
Whats your plan?
I would say hold for at least 5 years. Mining will be finished in 2140. That’s crazy and past our lifetime 
@_date: 2018-03-23 23:04:07
Can you please include bitcoin on the cake is some way and share it with us on Reddit?
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:53:34
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:15:13
 Bcash
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:56:55
What is this advertising? 
@_date: 2018-03-23 19:34:35
The supply is 21M so what your saying doesn’t make sense 
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:38:45
@_date: 2018-03-20 00:10:18
Sell the amount you need, if urgent and keep the rest 5 Years minimum. Mining is finished in 2140(!)
Bitcoin could potentially become a new digital gold. I consider that it already is 
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:22:22
That’s cool 
@_date: 2018-03-26 12:44:19

So, running a full node with a Wallet without BTC In it. Would that contribute to the network?
I thought only BTC miners contributed?
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:49:56
I want to contribute! Running a full node without any BTC in the wallet. Would that contribute in any way? Would be great with input to this
@_date: 2018-03-25 19:13:17
@_date: 2018-03-22 00:14:58
Why do you consider it better than the nano?
@_date: 2018-03-21 23:32:39
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:46:15
Good one ‘ya!
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:00:46
Only joking! I’ve heard nocoiners say that the CEO of bitcoin has moved away from it and gone the bcash way... pretty sad, yet fascinating how manipulative Roger Fuckface is!
@_date: 2018-02-09 22:02:10
@_date: 2018-02-15 07:53:10
I though Roger Ver was the CEO of it?!
@_date: 2018-03-26 11:31:38
I wonder if the Sinaloan drug cartel are making purchases from the one in Culiacán ��
@_date: 2018-03-25 16:48:51
Good for him! New halvening In 2020, make sure he knows that. And that the end of mining is around 2140
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:03:49
Very cool
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:39:47
Lol. He seems like a simple man
@_date: 2018-03-25 03:26:25
Heard about that boat for some years now ;D
