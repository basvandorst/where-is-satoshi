No one would ever wait for $13k. People sell when they make a good profit. That’s the smart thing to do. I bought some BTC at 300 and sold most of them at 900, used to money as a down payment for my house. I kept a couple coins but I wish i hadn’t sold any. However, if I didn’t sell at 900 I would probably have sold at $2k. I’m 100% certain that I would have never risked waiting till now. I had a goal, my moon was to get a down payment for a house and I got there thanks to bitcoin. 
No regrets but I do think about the fact that I could have fully paid off 2 houses and had some left over if i waited till now. The growth this year has been beyond my wildest dreams.

It won’t be the first time bitcoin goes up like crazy and loses a ton of value. But it has always come back bigger than before. If there is a crash short term, we’ll see another steep rise in 2021, shortly after the halving event. There was a halving event in 2016 and we saw a huge rise in 2017. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:55:19
Yep! I bought a small purse for my wife on overstock, it was about $80 bucks in bitcoin. I’m too lazy to do the math but let’s say that’s $5k today. I tell my wife she’s got a $5k purse better take care of it!

The market cap for all cryptos at the moment is half a trillion dollars. It can be 100 trillion by end of next decade, it’s truly revolutionary tech. However, due to the issues we’ve seen with bitcoin, it may never reach its full potential. Too many alts do what bitcoin does but better. This means that it’s very likely that other coins will grow and BTC stagnates. For this reason I suggest that you diversify. Pick 6-8 coins and buy some of each. Buy more of the safe bets like Ripple and Monero. Buy a little bit of the risky ones, who knows, they may get you 5000% gains long term.

The total value of gold ever mined would exceed $8.2 trillion. There is a market for gold and it gets bought and sold everyday. Rich people use it to store their wealth, or parts of it anyway. Why not Bitcoin?

People won't want to spend it, they will hoard it and only sell for big ticket transactions like buying a house. They won't spend it on coffee, they'll spend fiat for that.

Without giving up the secret sauce, how does it work? 
@_date: 2014-12-10 22:39:46
For long term I look at risk vs reward. Risk is there but it's low comparing to reward, which has ridiculous potential. Bitcoin market is around 5 billion at the moment. I see a future where it's hundreds of billions.
Number one rule is, DO NOT INVEST MORE THAN WHAT YOU'RE WILLING TO LOSE!

I have several copies distributed around. My mom has one. I keep one at work. If anyone finds it, it's useless to them because they don't have the password, as mentioned in my last comment.

Yes and blockchain users got hacked. Long term storage you need a paper wallet bip38 printed offline. Or trezor. 
@_date: 2014-10-23 23:49:12
I disagree. In order for mass adoption to happen we have to think in bitcoins as a unit, bits or xbits or millibits will simply not work. You have to consider the general public.
Thanks for your input btw, just cause I don't agree with it doesn't mean I don't appreciate it. It's important to have these discussions.

I really like BreadWallet, it's awesome! One question I have is, would you trust thousands of dollars on BreadWallet or just a few hundred bucks?
@_date: 2014-12-30 13:50:07
You can find someone on Craigslist. I found a person who's whole job is to buy and sell coins. She's basically a private/personal exchange. She met me in a public place, we made the trade, it was very easy. This was a cash transaction, as anonymous as it gets. 
Someone suggested coin base but they track your coins, as some people here have found out recently. 
Obviously finding someone on CL is risky but if you're smart, you can stay safe. Meet in a well lit area with security cameras, don't go alone, wait at least 30 mins for 3 confirmations. Wait an hour for 6 confirmations if you really want to be sure. 
@_date: 2014-11-27 14:29:55
I have, so far so good. 
@_date: 2014-10-23 22:42:52
Yes there is, confusion will hinder mass adoption.
@_date: 2014-11-06 16:32:57
I don't think they banned it yet. When or if they ban it in Russia, there will be another huge boom. Russian black market is huge and anything the government bans will definitely fuel adoption in that country.

The person robbing me would have to find the private keys and beat the password out of me since they're BIP38. But guess what, someone can break in your house and steal anything. If you really want to protect them, put it in a safety deposit box. 
Paper wallet and/or trezor will ensure that a hacker on the other side of the world can't touch your coins.

You should watch the scene, it really has nothing to do with bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-10-23 23:42:01
Like it or not, bitcoin today is not a currency, it's a commodity. One day, hopefully, we'll have an end-to-end bitcoin ecosystem where it will be looked at as a true international currency, but not today. We need to make this change before it's too late.

@_date: 2014-12-09 00:55:36
Those are the only safe methods of storing large amount of bitcoin. Otherwise they have to trust a 3rd party. And my point is, why? Bitcoin was designed so that you never have to trust a 3rd party with your money.

2 siblings (I forget their names) reaching the age of 25 in 10 days will able to sell 45% stake of their company which would bring them combined total of 3.1 billion dollars. The other 2 people in the room (one of them is old) are very upset about this decision. When asked what they want to do with that money, they say they want to be entrepreneurs. One of them says, "maybe invest in bitcoi.." and he get cut off by the old man who says "shut the fuck up &lt;insert name&gt;"
This is funny because it's clear that this particular sibling is the dumb one and no matter what he says, it's immediately dismissed cause he's in idiot. Anyway it's hard to explain without context, watch the show if you get a chance, it's actually a pretty good show.

Last I tried, bip38 wallet didn't work. The only thing I use it for is to watch my paper wallets. 
Breadwallet for spending. 
Bitwallet for monitoring cold storage. 
@_date: 2014-11-15 04:03:52
I have my Bitcoin savings in a bip38 paper wallet that I printed offline using piper wallet printer. I'm 100% positive my coins are safe as long as no one gets the password in my head. 
Even if someone gets the private keys some how, they're useless because of bip38
@_date: 2014-10-23 23:47:23

There's one other person who has it. 
@_date: 2014-12-08 01:16:01
I use piper wallet
I can print paper wallets that are bip38 encrypted. I then use bitwallet to load up the public keys so I can watch them. I keep several copies of each wallet laying around, at home, work. I also made digital copies I emailed myself. I'm not worried about anyone finding those paper wallets because they need a password to access them. The worse thing is they'll know how many bitcoins I have.
@_date: 2014-09-20 18:32:32
That's correct 
@_date: 2014-10-23 23:45:04

I'm not going to pretend that I know enough about the history there. I know Kiev was the capital of Russia at one point and I know Ukrainians met the Nazis as liberators in WWII, that's it. 
I know this, Russia's actions in Ukraine, regardless of who initiated the conflict, caused US and EU to implement sanctions that are causing the ruble to fall.

Tell your friend to get an iOS device with bread wallet. It can make a QR code requesting any amount in U.S. Dollars and it will automatically convert to amount of Bitcoin based on exchange rate. This way he will have a new address for every customer and it will always request exactly 1 dollar.

I recommend moving them yourself at that point, since there are 2 devices now with access to those coins. 
@_date: 2014-11-12 16:35:48
I think some people are afraid it's a scam so they don't sign up for changetip. If it's been a couple of days and they don't collect, I send them a private message so they know I'm a real person and not some bot. So far only 1 person hasn't collected.

I got one a while ago and it's awesome. I guess the only complaint I have is that I spent $230 to print out a few paper wallets for cold storage and have never used it since. I was too lazy to do it the old way of using a linux CD with a cheap printer.
@_date: 2015-05-26 00:33:26
Are you telling me that every private key public key combo is on this database? How is that possible? Would I be able to search through it and find a public address that I know has a bunch of money in it and steal those coins? What am I missing here?
@_date: 2014-09-21 01:42:07
Go to coinbase.com and register an account. Give them your bank account number so they know where to get the dollars from. Click buy Bitcoin and purchase $20 worth. 20 bucks will disappear from your bank account  and $20 worth of Bitcoin will get deposited in your coinbase account. Minus fees. 
@_date: 2015-05-16 20:08:25
I know android is a requirement but I highly suggest that your dad get a iPod touch or iPad mini and download bread wallet. It's super simple to use and you can install the same wallet on multiple devices. If one device gets stolen, they won't be able to spend the money without Touch ID or passcode and you could easily use the other device to send the Bitcoin elsewhere. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 17:52:17

@_date: 2014-12-08 20:57:19
What's your point? They can take the keys if they want, they can't do anything without the password. The password should be in your head and maybe a couple of relatives that you trust.
Safe deposit box keeps the keys safe in case someone breaks in your house and tries to beat the password out of you.

I'm in the same boat as SobeTrader. I bought a Piper Wallet and printed BIP38 protected paper wallets. I use bitWallet app for iOS to keep track of my coins but I never uploaded the private keys anywhere. The best part about a BIP38 paper wallet is that even if someone gets a hold of my private keys, they're useless without the passphrase.

You can configure coinbase to automatically and periodically buy a specific amount, for example it will buy $200 every 2 weeks. This is called a dollar cost average strategy and is the safest way to invest in volatile assets.

Sorry but your math doesn't check out. If market cap is $4 billion right now then 10X that means each coin would be worth 10X what it is today, making it less than $3k, not $10k per coin. 
However, I think $40 billion market cap is too low. There are $60 trillion dollars out there, that's a ridiculous amount. Even if bitcoin fails as a currency but replaces gold as store of value, even by a little amount, we can see a market cap well about $100 billion. Hell, even if all it's used for is online gambling we can easily break $50 billion.

Not sure why but it would have been nice to have them mention the fact that Bitcoin would have been just fine while the whole banking system melted down. I kept waiting for someone to mention it.

Doesn't that make OP_RETURN useless? Why would anyone take money that can never be spent?
