Even the altcoiners listen – they can't help themselves
@_date: 2016-08-07 05:57:47
What's you objection? You never voiced it...
@_date: 2016-08-07 05:14:13
Okay then, care to please explain your position?
@_date: 2016-08-07 02:24:28
Are you even a Bitcoiner?
@_date: 2016-08-07 05:56:12
Wow, now I'm *really* interested in seeing the BU guys interview him
@_date: 2016-08-06 04:37:34
It's amazing how they took over your podcast app to make it impossible for you to pause and restart at a later occasion. 
These guys must be very powerful 
@_date: 2016-08-07 05:54:58
@_date: 2016-08-07 05:07:21
You saying that he has a message?
@_date: 2016-08-07 05:18:15
Like I said, I know and like them
@_date: 2016-08-07 05:47:00
So you think that would not be an interesting interview- why?
@_date: 2016-08-07 04:50:41
Do I look like "those guys"?
@_date: 2016-08-07 05:12:41
So my answer to your whitewashed question of whether I am "associated" with them was:
I know them and I love their work so if that's "associated with them" then I guess perhaps that's a yes
PS. I hate whitewashers 
@_date: 2016-08-07 05:21:06
Are you usually a whitewasher?
@_date: 2016-08-07 05:17:15
I did state what my "association" is 
@_date: 2016-08-07 05:10:02
He/she is indeed ;)
@_date: 2016-08-07 05:03:59
Why did you white-wash your comments?
@_date: 2016-06-17 23:52:46
Exactly, they need special treatment in Bitcoin. Safe spaces required!
@_date: 2016-06-17 23:45:16
Yeah, they are going DAOwn
@_date: 2016-06-11 05:49:23
@_date: 2016-06-18 08:00:44
That's how the name was chosen - no?
@_date: 2016-06-18 06:13:48
You're right on the money
@_date: 2016-06-18 00:25:12
Ahh, so that's where she got the encouragement that she was smart. Much explained – thank you!
@_date: 2016-06-18 06:41:33
I'm sure they're open to suggestions. What are the ways you have in mind?
@_date: 2016-06-18 06:48:37
Is that real life? Damn! She should get away with saying anything she wants for sure. 
@_date: 2016-06-18 06:24:05
Like MySQL Cluster? They should do a crowdsale. Wait, that's Oracle. Hahaha
@_date: 2016-06-18 08:35:35
You sayin that as a woman?
@_date: 2016-06-18 08:38:26
What interactions did you have?
@_date: 2016-06-01 14:11:51
That should be stickied somewhere. Well done!
@_date: 2016-06-18 00:20:25
When you make yourself look stupid one must threaten a lawsuit
@_date: 2016-06-18 01:58:14
Okay, got it. agree
@_date: 2016-06-11 05:51:09
What do you guys think of the 'Spokeswoman of Bitcoin'?
@_date: 2016-06-18 06:09:34
That was a good TL;DR
@_date: 2016-06-18 01:33:55
Explain that? No time to Google :)
@_date: 2016-06-18 07:00:45
You're right, they were unfairly easy on her. Good observation!
@_date: 2016-06-18 06:18:59
I agree
@_date: 2016-06-18 06:21:30
Blythe is on her advisory board
@_date: 2016-06-18 06:12:59
Solid point
@_date: 2016-06-18 01:29:52
Right, that doesn't pass the sniff test
@_date: 2016-06-18 01:57:05
yeah, dinner :)
@_date: 2016-06-18 06:42:32
Yeah, that guy's a prick :)
@_date: 2016-06-18 00:21:10
That's what she's asking herself. LOL
@_date: 2016-06-29 00:37:14
Even though the BU guys were somewhat appeased after they talked to Big Vern, there is no way that I would have gone near Cryptsy after watching them interview him.
I wonder how many other people felt that same way and got out or just stayed away.
I think "the two dumbest men in Bitcoin" potentially saved lots of people a big chunk of change.
@_date: 2016-06-11 06:58:11
Can you be a little more vague?
@_date: 2016-11-10 22:09:17
You need to climb all the turtles until you get to the top turtle
@_date: 2016-06-17 23:01:42
I listened to her interview and IMHO she did an embarrassing job. Here it is:
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:27:12
now you did it - those compliments are gonna go to his head!
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:35:49
To the moon Alice!
@_date: 2016-11-09 22:34:39
They would be the first to admit that they're idiots
@_date: 2016-10-31 02:41:36
That is very self-serving of you. Everyone here already thinks that I am you just because I'm a super-fan of your content. 
I feel like I'm talking to myself. ��
@_date: 2016-10-16 21:39:21
Golden teeth for the underserved FTW!
@_date: 2016-05-02 20:13:32
Yeah, that was amazeballs. I happened to unmute the TV just before that came on!
@_date: 2016-05-02 20:40:41
It seems like someone in the production department of that news network has a sense of humor and probably 'gets' Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-05-03 00:21:48
Your comment made me laugh out loud :)
@_date: 2016-05-03 01:29:05
No worries – the original is on my iPad :)
@_date: 2017-07-25 01:51:04
This is sooooo stoooopid! These clowns have not even thought this through very well :/
@_date: 2016-07-06 16:57:17
This was during a regular Bitcoin Meetup and Bitcoin is mentioned throughout the interview
@_date: 2016-07-07 00:40:16
Wait, are you an actual Onecoin retard or are you just making a parody?
@_date: 2016-07-06 22:22:31
The people that come to our Bitcoin Meetups usually walk away smarter unless they are committed to some kind of agenda that keeps them stupid
@_date: 2016-07-18 06:01:49
agreed - but if that was in the critical path then the 2 hour drive with 5 people may never have happened. The most important thing is for people to commit to show up and blow up their bullshit any way possible.
people are gonna get hurt by this scam
@_date: 2016-07-18 06:05:20
Onecoin refers to themselves as "The Bitcoin Killer". To me that *IS* relevant to @_date: 2016-07-06 19:21:35
That's comedy gold right there
@_date: 2016-07-18 02:44:06
Yeah, they're my favorite idiots 
@_date: 2016-07-19 19:08:29
I found it very boring and only made it 50 seconds in before dipping out :/
@_date: 2016-07-18 06:02:54
you have seen the worst - the audio is far less damaging :)
@_date: 2016-07-18 04:39:52
These scammers are all over the world. They need to be called out.
@_date: 2016-07-06 22:18:29
I think they are targeting the older less technical crowd who feel like they missed the boat
@_date: 2016-07-18 02:01:49
Maybe his underwear is not as comfy?
@_date: 2016-07-07 02:56:24
Sorry, I misinterpreted what you said. My bad. 
@_date: 2016-07-07 17:27:26
That was the most valuable post in this entire thread. I'm gonna keep that URL handy. Thank you.
@_date: 2016-07-06 19:01:35
This guy attends about 80% of the weekly Meetups. Their entire pitch tries to leverage Bitcoin as a baseline for their arguments
