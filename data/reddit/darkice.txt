Two possibilities.
1. He is real Satoshi, things will get more interesting.
2. He is not satoshi, then the Real guy should put out an irrefutable(pgp, blockchain) message that says that guy is not satoshi leave him be.
Powers that be are really interested in finding Satoshi because the really need a scapegoat to pin this bitcoin thing on, they still believe finding him/her might be effective method of getting rid of bitcoin, this is like trump wanting to turn off internet and go ask bill gates about it.

you can just factory reset your device you dont need a new one, they just want to see and selectively block the traffic, Leave the privacy issue aside, it just won't work, that's why I'm wondering whose idea was this.

We should also hide the posts and put a single button, anytime u push it a random vote goes to a random post.
@_date: 2015-12-02 20:47:01
That, will not work. At all. Whose idea was that :)

Not if he is in custody, you can still argue he can work with a third party to release such a message when he is in custody.
Most IT related mysteries or hackers etc did not got caught because someone found em, they got caught because they couldn't keep themselves from boasting or telling someone. Being silent is really hard on human psyche.
I have no opinion on the subject that if he is or he is not SN, I believe the real SN is smart enough to at least prove the point by sending a clever message. Yea he can do it himself but I think it's unlikely.

we should actively stop using mastercard as a payment system and they should feel that was the wrong move

Attempt at market manipulation, mixing known facts with things like 750k BTC stolen. Insider atbitrage in Gox is also known and only logical for them to do.
True Facts about Mt. Gox are
1. They were going down for almost 6 months know.
2. Instability of their exchange is hurting bitcoin
3. We do not know the current amount and safety of the bitcoins inside mtgox because no one but mtgox knows those numbers.
4. Mt gox. Finally dying or closing shop etc is good for the mid-long term
5. After Mt gox BTC will see a price drop then recuperate
6. Please avoid using words like panic,btc is dead bla bla.
7. BTC survived a couple disasters like this before history is repeating itself.

First of all, whomever or whatever you do business with, get a clean computer and create your own paper wallet, only you should do it, no one else no friend no whatever. Than burn that computer and the printer u used to print the wallet with, then give your friend the address of the wallet which you created, let him/her send the money to it, check the transfer from blockchain. Take the paper wallet with you and go.
Don't loose the paper wallet. Creating the wallet yourself is of extreme importance that will ensure only you can reach the funds. 100k is a lot of money for almost anybody in the world.
And you don't need internet connection on a computer to create wallet and transfer funds to it so VPN is not necessary.
Good luck.

I seriously believe Chinese officials are playing a yes/no/yes/no game, simple fact is they want absolute control over their currency and bitcoin is a threat to their deeply traditional we are in control feelings. They will say yes than no etc as many times as they could, we should just ignore them i guess, but unfortunately chinese cannot ignore them, which is unfortunate.
All of us who has the luxury to ignore those guys should just ignore them, they will give up eventually.

Please kick Karpeles out of bitcoin foundation. Mtgox is dead.   They were dead for a while now. Spreading fud like that and hurting bitcoin and the community is bad. We should punish people like that so no one in the future might consider such a stupid move.

Only if they found those 200k coins earlier, they could have continued the charade for a couple more weeks :)

Wel this might cause the block against Russia to embrace bitcoin, Which is good in my book :) , but it is sad, Totalitarian wannabees like Russia China etc dont like what they cannot control. It wont change anything in the long term, when something is better , faster cheaper and easier to use it will eventually take over the old clunky and expensive. 
I am happy that I am not Russian, my  sympathies to friends in Russia.

Cash can be used by terrorists.
Cellphones can be used by terrorist as an excellent comm device.
Guns can be used by terrorists.
Flashlights can be used by terrorists.
Hell I'm sure terrorists are using toilet paper too, we should do something about that toilet paper should be regulated.

They will complete JPY withdrawals and close shop. Its logical for them to not have any legal issues inside Japan for their own sake. this is just a last minute fix on their part before they go down.

Well, when you think about it, it's not that crazy of an idea, it's even logical.

You can check your transaction with website like blockchain . info (do not trust or click any links in any bitcoin related environment google it yourself and check the security certificate, that includes my link as well) if receiving address has the bitcoins you should see the transaction from there

%99.99999 percent of the worlds illegal transactions are done with US dollar bills, they are easy to carry around and mostly very difficult to track and I should mention they are being produced by a shady private organization that US government cannot audit or check in any way.
Obvious conclusion is to ban US dollars from being used right ?

@_date: 2013-07-05 23:24:29
you are mathematically right, can you also calculate the difference in percent. personally I wont mind having one of those tickets :)
I mean 2^256 is
if you divide it by 2000 it is
the difference of chance between the first 1936 tickets and the last 64 is
that number is so incredibly small i think it is negligible  :) , but you are right it is higher than zero. lets call it epsilon :)
@_date: 2013-07-05 22:25:58
% operator does not divide in python it is mod operator. so it will be mod 2000, not division
