The time between blocks is a random variable of an exponential distribution. To cut down on math, put this string into wolframalpha to calculate how often (on average) the time between blocks is longer than `X` minutes:
    1/Exp[-X/10]
Examples: [40 minutes]( [an hour](
So 40-minute block happens on average every 54 blocks. Which is quite often… about every 9 hours. So while it might be a bit surprising for a non-math person, such long blocks are to be expected and do not mean that miners are slacking.

Let assume you've got 200% of current mining power hidden in a closet. Then you can mine two blocks and decide which nonce you want more. 
Now, entities like NSA or Google could have enough power to do so. Then you wouldn't want to use it for cryptographic purposes.
I am also unsure how nonces are chosen to be checked by mining software. If they just go from zero and check consecutive numbers, the useful randomness would be only in few last bits of nonce.
As unlikely as it might seem, /dev/random is probably faster and more secure anyway. However if all you want is to make another kind of geohashing, nonces would be good enough.

You can see the discussion linked on OP's page. TL;DR: some people think the specific technical solution chosen is an ugly hack which will be difficult to maintain later. And while there's an alternative solution, it isn't much better. A quote from third page of discussion:

I doubt it. Even if they were generating one key every microsecond (which is impossible unless they'd have lots of machines dedicated to this task), they'd have just 10^14 keys.
@_date: 2012-01-22 15:14:30
If you take birthday paradox under consideration, that value reduces to about 1.78x10^14. This is because addresses are generated at random, so it takes about sqrt( 2^160 ) == 2^80 addresses to be generated before a collision has a significant chance to happen (collision means two people having the same address).

It all depends on the miners because they accept transactions. If you manage to convince 51% of miners to modify the algorithms so that e.g. blocks will be worth 50BTC forever, then it will happen.
Rules have been already changed few times. See [Bitcoin Enhancement Proposals]( However now a change of total number of bitcoins would be considered very controversial…

Again, API uses timestamp in microseconds as transaction id, so my guess would be that the transactions are simply processed as fast as server can. So probably no minimal spacing between transactions except for the time server takes to process a request. Anyway, on a mtgoxlive without zooming the resolution is about 1 minute per pixel (assuming height being 1000 pixels).
@_date: 2011-12-16 12:21:36

If you read news about [bitomat takeover]( you'll see that they were fighting with some ugly bugs for the last few days, and that they actually planned to launch this on Monday. I fear they didn't actually fixed all the bugs yet...
@_date: 2011-10-20 20:02:55
There was something like what you propose earlier: CPUShare ([archive.org's clone]( One italian guy wanted to make a marketplace for CPU time. People could sell/buy CPU time (sellers had to give some RAM too, and the price could vary depending on whether someone has faster processor, higher bandwidth and so on... I assume if GPGPU were known back then, it would also be a price factor). However, it didn't took off and now the site is closed.
There were few problems to solve: how to ensure that the code you get to execute is safe, how to provide a safe environment so that neither the seller can look into the computed data, nor the buyer can access any data on seller's machine. Also at the beginning the code had to be written with CPUShare in mind, which IIRC was pretty difficult (the environment was very limited, e.g. no disk access) -- only later they started using real virtual machines where possible.
That's loooots of work, and integrating it with bitcoin would be even more complex.
I imagine that keeping this kind of service independent of bitcoin infrastructure and making a marketplace where you can buy CPU/GPU time for bitcoins would be even better: simpler, and would make more people use bitcoins.

There's more than 200 depth points: I took a random depth file from my archives and it had 1600 points). And there's more than 100 price points during a day (otherwise you limit yourself to resolution "once in 15 minutes"). A json file with depth as sent by mtgox API takes around 15-20kB.
Also note that this is JavaScript, which means every number is represented in 8 bytes (a `double`-type variable), not counting whatever overhead containers have.
I'm not saying it is impossible. I say it might be tricky to get it right.
@_date: 2011-12-21 23:02:36
It already uses 10^-5 BTC, or maybe even something smaller--never cared to check. Also, usually distance between ask and bid is ~1% (twice the amount of mtgox transaction cost).

You cannot limit code to CUDA. You have no input/output then. Even if you'd make some magical wrappers about data getting sent into GPU and retrieved, you almost certainly have to make some routines that prepare/interpret data to limit bandwidth usage, otherwise 100MBps would not be enough. That's why it is so hard...

So, a method similar to the one used for Bitcoin transfer fees. Except that bitcoin's is still a bit more complex, taking the age of coins into account.
That would add complexity (probably not that much, though—it doesn't have to be computed by the matching engine), but could indeed help.

The logic used for calculating lowest allowable fees in standard bitcoin client seems to be here:

Age is only used in the (required, but not yet sufficient) condition of allowing the transaction to go free.

Ok. To give some perspective, situation in Poland: checks are basically unknown here, and banks aren't even really prepared to handle them well—fees and delays are outrageous. Credit cards are used mostly to deal with foreign business—I think most people here don't have any real credit card, some have only ones for electronic-only use. Transactions in-person are either cash or debit cards. E-commerce is either debit cards, local money transmitters or bank transfers. B2B, government (taxes/social aid), salaries and person-to-person electronic money transfers—bank transfers.

TBH, I don't know what is usually used in the finances. I guess the simplest applicable test for volumes would be probably [Welch's t-test]( — it's quite possible that not only value of volume, but also its variance has changed, so it would be risky to apply anything simpler.

You can get quite a lot of knowledge by just tracing a single address and all related transactions.
For example, if someone publishes a donation address, it's already over—you can check how much did that person get in donations. If he doesn't manage his transactions carefully (hint: it's impossible with default bitcoin client), you can track his other addresses if even just a single of his transactions has inputs from both the donation address and any of his private addresses.
The same thing is with businesses. If a customer pays for anything with bitcoins, the customer knows one of the company's bitcoin addresses. The company will then probably use customer's transaction money in some other transaction, therefore allowing the customer to track some of the company's other addresses. This is not a sure information, but with enough data (ie. multiple transactions) you can have a significant probability of having meaningful data.
Then, if business A buys anything from business B, it can trace back transactions made to other addresses of business B. Assuming that business A has its own customers and can identify them, business A can now find out which of their customers were also involved in transactions with business B. Easy way to find out which customers happen to use your competitor's services.
You need a layer of abstraction (like: payment processors who mix transactions over all the businesses which work with them, and which behave as gateways in both directions) to hide the transactions against a casual, external observer. But then the payment processors get lots of identifying information…

That's not enough, though. Another condition for the one-bitcoin-day rule is that the transaction itself must be smaller than 10kB. You can count every input as ~200 bytes, therefore you can send only ~50 inputs in a single transaction for free. OP seems to have 175 inputs to spend.

This is what happens when you actually give back responsibility to manage money to people who always depended on others to keep money safe. Almost all of normal folks don't even know that a dictionary password is weak. This is bound to happen till exchanges start requiring using strong passwords and 2-factor authentication, like real banks. Otherwise there will always be people too lazy to learn—the increase in frequency only means that more and more normal people start with BTC, not that there's some weakness.

Verification in bittorrent works in parallel because blocks in bittorrent don't depend on each other for validity. On the other hand, you cannot decide whether a block in bitcoin is valid if you don't know whether the previous block is valid or if you don't know which transactions are still not spent in all the blocks up to the one you check. So, the data structure itself is inherently unparallelizable.
