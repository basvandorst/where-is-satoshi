I've used GoldMoney for years. Mostly as a holding for my gold and silver.  Anyway, I wrote to James Turk in June of last year suggesting that he take a look at Bitcoin and consider it as a method of exchange for GoldMoney gold/silver.
This is the email that he sent to me:

MtGox accepted it. Whew!
@_date: 2011-06-04 21:02:16
If that happens they are gone. The same as if you dropped your wallet full of cash into the ocean. On the other hand, it's possible to back up your wallet.dat file. I currently have a scheduled task that runs every morning and copies it to my Dropbox folder.
@_date: 2011-06-04 22:36:02
Well, I'm a bit paranoid so I do encrypt it and I don't keep all of my bitcoins in one place. 1/3 in MtGox, 1/3 in my wallet, and 1/3 on the pool servers.
@_date: 2011-05-10 05:05:34
Shit! I just double sent bitcoins to MtGox. My computer was mining and was sluggish and I click the send button twice in the Bitcoin client and it shows 2 sends of 5 bitcoins. The time is off by 1 second between the two transactions. What happens if Mt.Gox doesn't accept the second transaction? Does it come back to me?
@_date: 2011-06-12 02:39:12
In a manner of speaking. I tried selling at $18 when the price was sliding. I tried 4 times to enter my order but it wouldn't take. If MtGox can't handle a few thousand sells then yeah, my confidence is shaken.

I just installed a new HD 6950 and I'm splitting my mining between deepbit and slush's pool. I'm doing about 318 MH/s. I'm also running a couple of CPU miners off hours. I'd be willing to throw some mining your way once you're up and running.

I was thinking about something else today that might work in conjunction with an open exchange: bitcoin insurance. The idea being that people can contribute bitcoins to an insurance pool. People who want to take out insurance against an event like what happened at MtGox would pay a percentage each month to cover their coins that they have in the exchange. The monthly fees would then be distributed to the insurance pool based upon how much each has contributed. 
A couple of things. This would only cover bitcoins in the exchange against hacking. Insurance wouldn’t cover personal wallets on users computers. Users of the exchange would need to have a password of a certain complexity to qualify for insurance. I think that the admins would be able to verify that a password was adequately complex without knowing what the password is (citation needed). Participating exchanges would need to provide regular security audits to the insurance pool, which they should be doing anyway to promote legitimacy. 
Pooled insurance participants make a profit on the premiums. Insured exchange clients get peace of mind. Exchanges get an extra level of security and legitimacy. It’s a win win win situation.

I'd prefer an exchange that wasn't based in the US.
@_date: 2011-05-07 21:34:27
I was thinking about that... If the value of Bitcoin were to rise to a point that it became very popular, my guess is that the US government would simply buy them all up on the exchange. They have plenty of fiat money to do it and once they have them, take them out of circulation. 
@_date: 2011-08-03 12:31:57
As a Libertarian, you must understand that the free market will strengthen Bitcoin over time. Businesses that do not protect their customers’ Bitcoins will fail. Those that do will succeed. Likewise, Bitcoin users who do not take precautions or use wise judgment with their Bitcoins will lose while those that do will succeed. 
Truly it is the wild west of currencies. If you want someone else to protect/ regulate/ watch over you then perhaps Bitcoin isn’t right for you. This isn’t a judgment against you. Bitcoin isn’t right for everyone. It comes down to the age old question of security vs liberty. Choose one.
@_date: 2011-06-21 13:57:08
No, but thanks for jumping to conclusions. It became clear very quickly to me that this wasn't normal market behavior. I concluded that MtGox had been hacked. To what extent, I did not know. In order to protect myself, I wanted to transfer my Bitcoins to my safe wallet on my computer. 
Panic selling? On the contrary, I want to buy the hell out of those cheap coins. But alas, none of my buy orders showed up. 
@_date: 2011-05-10 00:29:35
@_date: 2011-06-21 18:45:25
Nobody knew what the hell was going on at this point. Was this a real market "correction"? Didn't seem natural, but if it was I wanted to buy, damn it! Was MtGox getting hacked and were everyone's coins being sold out of their accounts? I don't know but I didn't want to wait around and see my balance go to zero!
What would you have us all do. Wait around patiently for the guberment to figure it out for us poor simple minded citizens. I'm sure that they would put in place some well thought out regulations!
No thanks, I'll take my chances with Bitcoin. You don't have to play. There's a reason why I took half my bitcoins out of MtGox a couple of weeks ago. You can be sure that I won't be putting any more into an exchange that is so poorly managed and secured.
This is called REAL capitalism. MtGox didn't put it's profits into security to protect their clients and now it will fail, as it should. People will have gotten burned and will move their business elsewhere.

1 x 6990 doing ~720MH/s and 1 x 6950 doing ~318MH/s. I have a 5770 sitting idle because I don’t have a rig to put it in right now. It was the first GPU I bought when I wanted to start playing with mining. I also have a second 6990 on back order for NewEgg. I’ve been waiting 3 weeks since I ordered it. 
I had this idea of getting a big case and a new motherboard/cpu to put the 2 x 6990’s and 1 x 6950 in with a couple of huge intake fans and an exhaust fan connected to a dryer hose going into the attic crawlspace, but now I’m wondering if even that would keep it cool. Heat is a major issue. I live in Florida and I’m afraid to see my next electric bill.
@_date: 2011-05-06 01:43:15
No real benefit. I'm trying to determine which is the more profitable. So far, Slush has more has more accepted but it also has more stale than deepbit. There is actually one benefit, if the connection to one drops out I don't lose any mining time because all of the processing will fall to the other.
@_date: 2011-06-19 18:05:07
I have a negative $149 balance! WTF?????
@_date: 2011-06-21 14:01:31


Sorry, there is EVERYTHING weird about that. And just because you clicked sell 13 times and I only clicked sell 12 times does not make it okay or acceptable. 
I'm getting out of MtGox because this is not the first time this has happened. The last time there was a big sell off I was prevented from buying too. I kept getting "SQL error" when I tried to make a transaction. So until MtGox gets its shit together I won't be playing. They make plenty of money on everyone's transactions to invest in better infrastructure and security.

The problem I have with Kevin's story is that he was even able to put in an order to buy. While all this was going down I wasn't sitting there picking my nose. I tried to buy. I tried several times. I tried to withdraw my BTC. Nope. Couldn't withdraw even 1. I don't know about the rest of you but all I could do is watch in horror as I was locked out of any possible action to either take advantage of the situation or protect myself by pulling out my coins.
BTW, as soon as MtGox comes back online I am pulling everything out. 
@_date: 2016-07-08 22:26:28
Well.... if enough miners drop out then difficulty could drop so other miners may then join. However, if too many join then difficulty would increase again.

This. When supply is high and demand is low, it will take longer for your offer to be accepted. That can change in a minute should Bitcoin prices start to rally. 
To get your offer filled, lower the APR and/or increase the number of days of the loan. The good news is your offer gets accepted. The bad news is that when the rally happens you're locked into a lower APR for a longer time. If you think a rally is eminent then wait to offer at a higher rate/shorter lending time while it's happening. However your are not making any interest while your are waiting for the rally to happen.
My suggestion would be to split the difference: offer half of your funds at a lower rate to get them borrowed and then wait to offer the other half of your funds at a higher rate when the rally happens.

It appears that your video card is an HD 6870 which means you should have a hash rate of about 300/Mhs which factors out to approx. .02 BTC a day. This will decrease over time.
Some will argue that it's not cost effective to mine using that hardware due to electricity costs. This is probably true for today. However, if you believe that Bitcoins will one day be worth 1000's of dollars then you need to ask yourself if running at a loss today is worth a possible profit in the future.

Overall, my experience has been very good. They are still in beta so you have to expect the occasional glitches. Customer support is great and Raphael always responds to my emails in a timely manner. With that said, during the crazy run up yesterday, the system was unresponsive a lot of the time and I was tearing my hair out. 
On a bright note, I accidentally sold 10BTC at $909.00 due to the lag.

I thought about that, but I like the idea of someone getting Rhonda really cheap. I would love to see someone like a student or out of work/financially struggling person win her for a small amount of Bitcoin. She has been there for me through some really tough financial times and has only ever needed some minor repairs. 
On a more selfish note, I could make a lot more Bitcoins raffling her off then auctioning.

The government doesn't need to shut down Bitcoin with a massive amount of hashing power. 
Let's put ourselves in the government/central bank's place for a moment. Bitcoin is a huge threat. How is the best way to destroy it - forever? 
Step one - Begin buying up large amounts of Bitcoins. This can only be done slowly due to  the limitations of getting money into the exchanges. This is easy when you can "print" billions of dollars.
Step two - Drive up the price. Let there be occasional drops but nothing too drastic. Keep the price rising but not too crazy either. The goal is to raise expectations
Step three - Use the media to talk up Bitcoin. Throw some decent into the mix but the object is get people aware of and talking about Bitcoin.
Step four - When all the Libertarians, gold bugs, OWS, and others are full entrenched in Bitcoins AND when the quiet but disillusioned with the US financial system middle class types have started getting some of their savings involved, start the demonization propaganda against Bitcoins. This will center around reports of Bitcoin being used to fund terrorism, along with other bad things like child porn, drugs, etc.
Step five - Sell off the huge holdings of Bitcoins and crash the market. After the panic selling, buy up the Bitcoins and do it again, and again.
Results: People get burned and scarred off from ever considering another digital currency again. Low probability of getting caught due to Bitcoin's anonymous nature. If the market crash can be attributed to the government, simply state that they had evidence that terrorists were heavily invested and that it was done to combat global terrorism. The US was victorious. 'Merica!!

If someone's PC is being utilized as a part of a botnet to DDOS, it's basically unusable during that time anyway. Once the botnet operators stop the attack, that particular PC's ip address would stop sending traffic to MTGox and the LOIC would stop flooding it with traffic and move to other ip addresses that are DDOSing MtGox. It would be dynamic based on the feed coming from MtGox.

The story presented in this video is fiction, you realize. However I did notice something presented there that defies your proclamation that banks are not all evil. Did you miss it?
When Jimmy Stewart starts handing out money to the humble masses in exchange for them not initiating a run on the bank, he asks them, "how much can you get by on for just a week?" One woman says $20 and another says $17.50 (for which she gets a kiss). 
THERE is your evil. In 1946 your could "get by" for a week on $17.50. How many of us today could get by for a week on that?? Your "not evil" banks have stolen that much value from the dollar. If that isn't evil, I don't know what is.

Ask yourself if you can stand to lose $1299, because you very well may. It's a gamble. Not only is it a gamble that you may never get the device, but also that you will receive it so late in the game that it could take a very long time to recoup your investment.
Additionally, the price of Bitcoins are very volatile. You may get your device and find that you are mining Bitcoins that are worth a fraction of what they are worth today.
With all that said, I took the gamble and purchased a 30GH/s model. I won't be mining as many Bitcoins, but I was more comfortable with possible loss of money. Plus I paid for it with Bitcoins that I generated by GPU mining...

Yes, the developers write and maintain the software, but the real power resides in the pools. If the devs decided to make a major change to the software, the majority of the pools would need to switch to it for the change to have a an impact. Miners/pools have a vested interest in integrity of Bitcoin.

I was just thinking about this today and had an idea that I was looking for some feedback on. What about peer to peer BTC collateralized lending. Sort of like a Lending Club or Prosper but utilizing BTC as collateral. 
Here’s the scenario: someone who has some Bitcoins suddenly needs some cash (USD). They for one reason or another don’t want or can’t qualify for a loan through the normal channels. Likewise, they understand the value of Bitcoins and don’t want to sell them all on one of the exchanges. So he/she decides to take out a loan using their Bitcoings as collateral.
On the lending side, multiple individuals put up some cash into the pool. The pool receives the Bitcoins from the debtor and then the debtor receives the cash. The debtor agrees to pay back the loan plus monthly interest (lets say 10%). If the debtor pays off his loan he gets back his Bitcoins. If the debtor defaults, the Bitcoins are distributed proportionally to the pool of investors.
What do you think?
