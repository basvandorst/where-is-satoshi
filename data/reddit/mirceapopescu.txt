It might have been, maybe they see it as more dangerous to the USD than to the EUR.

Wheres' yours, Matt ?

Reddit is worth 240 mn in the sense FB was worth 100bn : complete puff. They'll sell for 500k or w/e in a decade, much like Myspace. The notion of a valuable website is nonsense.
Bitcoin is worth 120 mn in the sense the electronics industry was worth 120mn in 1950, or firearms makers in 1400. 
In other words : Bitcoin always was worth more than Reddit. Arguably, it's always been worth more than the Internet (and certainly more than the Internet in terms of the publically-accessible Internet as seen by Google).

Possibly misconstrued as "left". Some examples ?
@_date: 2012-11-05 11:09:56
Also, why the fuck are you using the last 8 characters of my gpg signature for a reddit nick ?!
@_date: 2012-11-03 08:48:26
That part was clear, you could say outstanding volume at any point reflects some judgement of my creditworthyness (not of the arrangement itself, because the bot is financed by bondholders). The "price" part is not clear, how do you extract a price from there ? 
But at any rate, seeing how something like 99.x% of options volume in 2012 happened there, I'd say it's safe to title it as it is. 
@_date: 2012-10-31 00:25:30
My thoughts exactly.
@_date: 2012-10-29 07:53:52
I. I don't necessarily think moving over signatures to the BTC infrastructure is a bad idea. As the girl pointed out it's not a question of PGP being in any way new software, but then again the point stands that from the pov of a multitude of users it is in fact new. Just like Bitcoin was new from their pov, a month earlier or whatever.
II. PGP in all implementations is specifically designed to allow and more importantly facilitate the exchange of encoded messages. BTC in all implementations is specifically designed to control and more importantly limit the exchange of encoded messages. It may seem on the highest level of abstraction that this marriage is in fact a bad idea.
III. While PGP suffers no detriment from public keys being publicly distributed, some arguments can be brought that BTC suffers some detriment from public keys being distributed. I'm not quite familiar enough with BTC to judge the merit of the arguments themselves, but I'd certainly like to see a thorough discussion of this point. I suspect nobody is yet sufficiently familiar with the entire matter to judge how slight exactly that detriment may be.
IV. Why centralize ? We have a system that does money flow and a system that does signatures. Why join them into one thing ? Banks and courts are separate entities historically, maybe there's some value in that ? If there is or if there isn't, what exactly are the advantages of centralisation, other than "ease of use" (with the caveat that ease-of-use in regards to signatures is a sword that cuts both ways, note just the prominent disclaimer included in stock BTC client about what messages to sign).
Really looking forward for more discussion on this topic (and Rassah, make a blog for chrissakes!)

I think the mechanism Tyrell describes above is spot on.
@_date: 2012-11-02 17:26:30
Afaik that was some anarchism flavour.
@_date: 2012-11-04 10:19:29
Certainly, on both scores.
Maybe it's time for some actual research into "how do people check bitcoin addresses" ? Any psych grads in thehouse ?
@_date: 2012-11-06 02:59:57
MPEx is commited to never distinguishing among coins. I'm sure everyone else will follow suit or face irrelevancy.
@_date: 2012-11-01 13:36:25
Pretty much only possible explanation.
Alternatively, techcrunch died the death of irrelevance a few years ago.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Highly entertaining discussion. I especially like the guy who has a friend in the NSA who has leaked to him that they have secretly cracked bitcoin's "code" because anything that is "electronic" can be broken. And the other guy who claims that "Bitcoin and federal reserve notes are the same animals". And the one claiming "Bit coin has been proven to be terribly flawed." All without any backing arguments, of course.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Who was saying a couple days ago that ZH consists of finance professionals/hedge fund managers etc and it's really important and relevant and all ?

Posting on reddit has got to help.
Back when they were ~$2 this summer people did a lot of reddit posting and soon enough BTC went up.
@_date: 2012-11-02 04:14:01
Indeed a good link.
@_date: 2012-11-03 08:51:01
Indeed. If you bring nothing to the table cotton picking awaits. Better get crackin'.

Haha sounds like a plan.

Well if what is actually true doesn't matter there's little point to a conversation now is it.

I think you grossly overstate the importante of ZH. To most of the financial community ZH is a sort of Maddox : a mix of the atrociously stupid, the incredibly exaggerated and the plain out wrong which is so over the top as to be amusing.

For most entry level kiddos this would be a step up from obsessivelly reloading brazzers or w/e they did in college. Since we're playing the "people like you" game and all.
@_date: 2012-11-02 12:12:20
Well maybe it was a little bit harsh, or a lot more than a little bit. And yes, there's nothing wrong with competition, but here's the thing : random guy throwing sticks in Africa is not competition for the NASA. 
I kinda dislike people starting to "build things" without even a cursory understanding of the field they're "building" into, mostly because virtually all the "hacks" constantly giving Bitcoin a black eye in the press originate in such endeavours. Ymmv.

It does help against _true_ inequality (ie, disparity between revenue and merit). It blows a hole in any plans to "improve" fake inequality (ie, disparity between individuals).
@_date: 2012-10-31 20:13:07
This.

I'd guess somewhere between a half and a quarter.

"And while it is one thing for the Chairsatan to say gold is not money but is merely "tradition", it is a whole new level of panic when a major central bank is forced to defend itself against an electronic currency."

Electricity isn't a major cost with the new asics (if they ever arrive).

The occupy movement was a public nuisance. It wasn't even a movement, just a bunch of retarded/malfeasant kids. 
The Liberty Dollar, which everyone seems to consider related, was an out and out scam. The guy made "silver" dollars which were worth about 26 cents and encouraged a bunch of idiots to pass them out for the real thing. If his silver dollars were worth a dollar he wouldn't have needed to either infringe the copyrights of the real coins nor do all the rest of the shady shit he did.
Bitcoin has nothing to do with either of those. Bitcoin isn't about retards crushed under a mountain of college debt which they can't repay cause they studied useless bullshit a la women's rights. Bitcoin isn't about smarmy surfers trying to pawn off forged coin under the pretense of some vague california-y "spiritual" mishmash. 
It would be great if everyone would stop associating the various harebrained schemes idiots came up with so far with Bitcoin. Bitcoin has nothing to do with either idiots or their harebrained schemes.
@_date: 2012-11-02 04:12:31
It's possible the cost of electricity becomes again relevant at some future point, but for at least years to come the main issue is obsolescence risk. What makes or breaks a post-asic mining venture is whether the asics it uses are rendered obsolete before they cover costs or not.

@_date: 2012-11-03 08:52:32
In that sense, yes, Bitcoin is only fate inasmuch as it's representative of cryptocurrency (ie, relevant). So far that inasmuch is pretty much.
The powers that some think may be can't do jack shit, and certainly not for hundreds of years. In fact, it'll be quite a work of wonder if they manage to save their hide for a couple decades at this point.
@_date: 2012-11-02 20:54:12

@_date: 2012-11-04 00:40:22
The presumption that humans only read a few characters at the beginning to validate an address is kind of weak. Some people probably read starting from the end, some others probably just notice patterns in one and check against the other.

The rating system already exists, it's called WoT. 
The scam listings already happen on btctalk. It's relatively useless anyway.
"Working with vendors/merchants" is something everyone's trying. There's no clear reason any vendors/merchants would give two shits about you (and indeed you seem to imagine they'll somehow care what you have to say merely because you're saying it).
There's no point reinventing the wheel, and there's no point in furthering this "i made a website" presumption. Go do something useful.
