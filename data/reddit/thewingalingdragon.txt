I deeply thought about taking a contract job out there and living in a little cinder block bunk house with nothing but my PC and internet, all 2mbps of it. 
I really really thought about it, 180K a year almost tax free and I would have put almost all of it in bitcoin. 
Then I got my dream job in the states and met my dream girl... She is on my side with bitcoin and is also investing her own money... But we have bills and we are living comfortably. w
It is a trade off, but I do envy you. Living hard now... You're going to probably be doing very well for yourself soon. 
I hope you return home safely and much more wealthy than when you left. All you guys out there deserve every bit of it. 
Keep HODLin out there and stay safe out there brother.

I actually clicked on his list of echanges link and immediately got hit by a stupid sounding warning and multiple Windows saying my phone was infected by a virus and to download virus protection now "ignore this message at your own risk" and other similar wording. I just killed the reddit app and reopened it to find this comment again, downvote it, and post this warning. 
I wouldn't click any of his links if I were you.

The flurry of self deprecating comments reminded me of "casually explained"

Now it's up over 1000 more than the price I quoted them =/
I feel like my inability to convey the importance of this is going to cause them to resent any amount of financial gain I am able to benefit from. 
But my gf and I talked it over. I tried, they listened, and they decided against it... That's all anyone can do. They can make and live with their big kid decisions and I can rest guilt free.

I've been mentioning it to my family for a few years and they've always brushed it off. 
I would bring it up causually when the conversation was turned to investing. 
I knew I was getting annoying so I backed off. 
The other day, at 5700, I sent them all a message which basically read:
"I won't message you guys about it anymore but I can't, in good conscience, go without making one last heart-felt attempt to reach out to you all about it. 
Here are two videos that quickly explain what it is and how it works. I am available to answer any questions you may have, to help get you started, and to point you toward resources for you to do your own research. Please just give it a sincere look with a critical eye and I think you'll recognize the value and potential. 
I am trying to talk to you about Microsoft before anyone has heard of Windows... Apple before mp3's were a household name... 
Blockchain technology is going to completely revolutionize the financial industry in our lifetime. 
I love you all and this is the last time you'll hear the word bitcoin from me."
My dad inquired why I wasn't spending all my money on it If I had so much faith in it, I told him "I am, everything I can afford" He said he would look into it and hasn't said anything since. Nobody else really bothered to reply. I think my sister and her husband are researching it but I'm not sure. 
It up almost 600 bucks since I sent that message to them four days ago.  I don't think they give a shit but I'll sleep a lot better knowing I tried.
