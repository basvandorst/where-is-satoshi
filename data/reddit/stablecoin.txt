I can, it would mean serious pushback. Possible developer or bitcoin celebrity jail time, exchanges shut down. The longer we have to decentralize onboarding the better.
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:05:02
I know this is the funniest thing to me. We are all using cryptos where you need specialized software and/or hardware wallets that you also have to hand write down and physically store a backup, there is very little option for real world day-to day purchasing, and some of these exchanges have such a bad UI you have to be a web developer to use it. On top of that to even purchase crypto in the first place many people have to physically go to their bank and wire funds to an exchange. And even in the early days before exchanges you would have to use these scummy western union fake services at Walmart or meet someone in person and hand them cash you took out of your bank.
And after all that we will now have the ability to transact instantly, but "Oh My God I HAVE TO OPEN A CHANNEL??? LIKE CLICK SOME BUTTONS AND BE ONLINE TO OPEN IT??? No way anyone would go through all that hassle. LN is a complete failure don't even know whey they are developing it."

That is always a risk but I think that ship has sailed. Digital currency before Bitcoin *was* shut down due to the fact it had one developer or company behind it. Bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies are decentralized enough, and there is a satellite that beams the blockchain down to earth. Are they going to shoot that down? Blockchain runs on such simple equipment you could probably configure a cell phone to run it, it is too easy to run a node. Because of that I think technology has finally surpassed what methods that government had to interfere. 
At some point a civil government does have to give into the will of it's people. Look at South Korea right now, 200K participants signed a petition to protest even the mention of shutdown. Japan is embracing Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to stay ahead in the global market. The US government can't pass a budget right now, and the Fed just came out yesterday and is publicly pretending that there is no threat - 
The longer this goes on the harder it will be to try and shut it down.

Electrum for desktop is a very good wallet, haven't tried it on mobile. Even though Electrum has Segwit address capability, since Coinbase does not originate from a Segwit address your transaction won't enjoy the benefits of Segwit in the form of faster tx, lower fees. 
You need to use an exchange that supports Segwit for their outgoing transactions, and also make sure that when you created the Electrum wallet you use the Segwit capable option.
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:02:33
That really isn't a Bitcoin problem specifically but a scarcity problem. Speculators help with price discovery in an asset, if there were no speculators then adoption won't happen or there is no market of sellers to give into the next round of users. How should the value be determined?
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:43:18
This is amazing and one of the biggest social features missing from BTC as the fees made it impractical. So glad to see it back.

I suppose but to this day you are able to run your own e-mail server on any desktop PC pretty trivially. The requirements to run an e-mail server have not really changed since the invention of e-mail. If people want convenience then a lot of times they will sacrifice something like their own control.

Segwit2X was a complete technological and social failure whereas Bitcoin cash is still operating smoothly for now as a separate chain. The difference is when B-Cash forked it provided replay protection, had it's own miners, nodes, etc., they are a different coin on a different network. They are technically a successful fork and only still fighting for the Bitcoin brand socially.
Segwit2X was an attempted fork with no proper replay protection and commitment from many (most?) of the miners to switch with them. This was only agreed upon after a meeting in New York by a few higher ups in Bitcoin companies and some miners, no users or developers had a say in this meeting nor were they in attendance. This was a complete hostile takeover attempt in hopes to completely halt or slow Bitcoin blocks, confuse Bitcoin nodes, and socially try to adopt all users with via airdrop of Segwit2X coins. It was completely contentious and Bitcoin developers had to work overtime to provide proper replay protection and many node operators needed to upgrade in preparation. When there was such backlash from the users, node operators, and developers, in addition waning support from miners, the original signatories of the NY Agreement decided to announce plans to cancel the fork of Segwit2X. Even worse, the fork still went through though it was coded badly with a 1-off error and the chain split never even triggered. 
 
There are reasons that Segwit2X is a complete failure as mentioned by Andreas but mostly it tried to mesh rather than fork and be separate like B-Cash. I like to remind people from time to time that companies such as Coinbase were very eager to essentially freeze the Bitcoin network. Users should have left them that day, and it is no surprise we find out now they are still actively working against Bitcoin's interests.

In a traditional equity bear market (recession) do you see people going into crypto though? That seems incredibly risky if you need the money to pay bills. If not then are you saying the market has run it's course, all the money has already come in? What about institutional money? Canada opened up a new retirement ETF (forget what it's called), Japan and Korea seem to be falling over backwards trying to support crypto through traditional channels. These are all new events announced within the last few months though, it will take some time to be realized as purchases I would think. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:17:04
You seem to want assurance of a sure thing, you should try government bonds. We are watching the growth of the most anticipated upgrade to Bitcoin in its entire history. Get out of here with your FUD, people will care that their fees will be lower and they have the option to instantly transact. In addition there is an entire new use case for Bitcoin (micropayemnts) that has never been possible since it's existance.
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:20:41
I think Lightning Network could spell the end for Bcash if they don't already see it. The channel opening might be awkward at first but I'm confident it will be smoothed out by software eventually, and the one example I saw had dual wallet which already seemed pretty easy to work with. Once the network is relieved due to exchange -&gt; exchange tx being taken off chain, the main chain should be cheaper too as Segwit will also be more prevalent, and even LN channel opening won't be as drastic of a cost/time as today. Eventually you should be able to buy on a lightning connected exchange, and transfer to a lightning wallet, and just never leave the main chain for those quick spends or crypto exchange transfers. Then there are atomic swaps that require Segwit which will also help to reduce on-chain load and give blockchain to blockchain value transfer, which they also won't have because they need....Segwit. This will open up greater connectivity to directly interact with Litecoin and Vertcoin which do have faster on-chain blcokchains...Oh and they will also have Lightning Network. The only thing they can claim by that point is having Bitcoin in the name, and maybe miners will still have to buy Bcash for equipment until a real competitor takes hold. 
It might not all happen this year but we are already seeing a lot of improvements early in 2018 hitting the front page and am excited to see more every week. If Roger really did sell off his BTC he won't be able to afford the shill brigade forever, although we should probably be ready for lots and lots of LN FUD not being Satoshi's vision.
@_date: 2018-01-22 02:32:34
I think it does to an extent. It has to work at some point, LN adoption is a little priced in at those high prices. There was a healthy pullback but as LN gains more adoption the news events will help push back to all time high.

@_date: 2018-01-26 19:10:13
Only an alt can claim this. With LN it actually will be faster and remain cheap because there are more channels to route through.
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:06:29
This is just your opinion, many people have been saying this at prices of $0.10, $1, $10, $100, $1,000, and now $10,000 per Bitcoin. 
Regardless of the price of Bitcoin if you purchase one from an exchange and transfer out to a wallet or offline wallet that you keep control of the keys, you will always have access to that Bitcoin (or fraction of a Bitcoin) as long as the network is running. Many people believe in this technology and it is fairly trivial to keep the network running even with a small amount of participation. The only way to get burned is if you invest more than you should or if you do not keep your keys safe.
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:35:50
They are both important and both will be needed for scaling. Schnorr will be good for businesses with lots of inputs/receives (ala Coinbase's economically locked wallet) and LN will be good to move non-trival transactions and things like exchange-&gt;exchange off of the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:30:12
I know you put /s but Bitcoin developers do have the ability to add even more decimal places for smaller units, just in case a satoshi does become impractical one day. I think it would need a hard fork though and who knows by then if a hard fork would ever be accepted.
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:30:39
It can and Bitcoin's capacity has never been impressive. Lightning will scale magnitudes higher than 3x of Ethereum. Now Ethereum also has scale roadmap so I don't know how that will look, but Ethereum today won't compare with Bitcoin Lightning. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:04:18
This is my favorite argument...Bitcoin is so unusable because everybody is using it.
@_date: 2018-01-19 04:00:26
From what I've seen explained it won't be easy for BCH to implement the same Lightning since they don't have Segwit. Other coins could implement it if they have Segwit capability, but I don't know if it would strengthen their position since it was designed specifically for Bitcoin and they will be getting it first. It is open source from my understanding so I'm sure it will be ported as much as possible.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:00:53
Overtaking something like the USD would be incredible, I too think that is a stretch especially at this stage. I do think though that a few major crypto-currencies will act as a major force outside of current banking practices that help keep them in check, and a country or central banks ability to manipulate their own currency for the benefit of the few will be mitigated. There will be a future where fiat and decentralized crypto are both accepted. I don't know the value in the end but I do think it is much much higher than today.
@_date: 2018-01-14 19:48:52
It lends credit to Bitcoin's strength of decentralization as that is one it's core requirements. It is not arbitrary, in fact it is quite an achievement because had the Segwit2X actually taken off then Bitcoin would have been a complete failure as socially we were to accept that humans were not meant to think on their own and follow authority in all walks of life. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:50:28
It legitimizes Bitcoin as a real tradable asset. It can be painful while big players try to game the futures contracts but it means more money (both long and short) are entering the system and at the end of the day more money will be required to make big movements.

It's not incredible to people who understand the technology and what trustless transactions offer. No longer do you need a government intermediary comprised of humans who are susceptible to rampant corruption...absolute power corrupts absolutely. This technology will free humanity from theft through inflation, unnecessary wars, and even corporate slavery. It will take some time and there will be bubbles and crashes along the way, Bitcoin might not end up being the world reserve like we all hope it will, but I assure you we are just at the beginning and we haven't seen anything yet.

They literally attack everything hoping something will stick. Its obvious to longer Bitcoiners but feel bad for new people trying to sort this all out. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:59:52
Good thing it is just your opinion. No longer will transactions be at the mercy of government intermediary comprised of corrupt individuals with absolute power...absolute power corrupts absolutely. Crypto will open up humanity in ways not even imagined, it introduces convenient and universal ways to protect from inflation theft, will help stop needless wars, and even free the corporate slavery that most are forced to live in. We are in a once in a generational boom that will connect global commerce at a scale only dreamed of when the internet first took root. This technology is so revolutionary and it is just getting started, in a few years it will be so obvious that many will feel bad for missing out just like when they scoffed at the horseless carriage, the personal computer, and even the decision for a bookstore to deliver books to your home. Heck, I remember when people thought that Netflix's decision to focus on streaming only was controversial, now they are a staple that threatens the entire cable television industry. Keep on having your opinions and I'll be thankful they are just that.
@_date: 2018-01-07 02:42:20
I think that is exactly what will happen. Coins like LTC and Vertcoin that also have Lightning and atomic swaps will be used to reduce the load on Bitcoin's main blockchain. It will all be seamless through swaps and Lightning Network, so people will just use what they have and get paid in the coin they desire. Gonna take a while to build that out and connect them still.

Even just taking the common transactions off chain is going to lower fees for everyone else.
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:43:09
Bitcoin developers and most users agree with that. There was also a bit in one of the recent Bitcoin upgrades (Segwit) that rendered a hidden mining optimization obsolete. One of the largest Bitcoin miners is also a producer of mining hardware, and is also the largest main miner for the Bcash chain. So there was economic incentive NOT to upgrade and instead keep on doing the same thing. When the users decided to force upgrade to Segwit last year he had no choice but to start his own chain to try and keep that optimization working. Bcash has no Segwit to this day. It takes some understanding but you seem like you are on the right track in your research.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:23:41
What is the catalyst for this crash though? Back then there was one exchange and research shows possibly one user single handedly drove the price from $150 to $1200 then Mt Gox exited with stolen coins. Now the ecosystem is more robust, and the general sentiment in crypto worldwide is nothing but mass adoption happening. More people getting involved, big money starting to realize. There was a catalyst for a crash then, but what is it now? That is how you can tell a bear market vs standard pullback. Check back in 2 months after the new cash is flushed out.
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:39:30
It will take some getting used to though I've seen the analogy that 'locking' up your funds is equivalent to transferring to a checking account (or pre-paid debit card) where you can spend with anyone else with a channel opened on the Lightning Network. The funds are always yours and you will have access to them until you spend them all or close out the channel. When you close out the channel any remaining or excess funds (if you sold or provided a service) are returned back to your original main-chain wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:26:16
Andreas said before that exchanges likely won't run Lightning due to KYC laws that they have to follow. I could see though it being very convenient if Coinbase stored your coins on a LN hub and allowed you to transact within their app, they would basically be a bank account in that regard.
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:00:56
If Bitcoin crashed in price like that again the amount of users would also decline significantly, thus lowering fees and network congestion. Also check around because things are moving around fine today. 
Also the alts will also get wiped out (assuming it is not a hack or defect in the Bitcoin protocol) and nobody would be taking over anything. In fact it would probably let Bitcoin network breathe a little and things like LN and other sidechain updates to roll out more methodically without the false urgency that big blockers are creating.
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:14:19

@_date: 2018-01-13 19:11:11
That's the most confusing part of their claims. 10-minute block times are probably the slowest of any crypto yet that's the sword they want to fall on. Bitcoin was never really fast like a credit card until Lightning Network.
@_date: 2018-01-16 00:23:42
Segwit will gain more adoption eventually and LN is slowly rolling out. It will survive and thrive though you may need to change your current practices and have to hang out more on the 2nd layer for spending.

Yeah people forget how things used to be even a 1-hour settlement is light years ahead of the old system. Still, will be nice when LN is an option for most transfers as it keeps Bitcoin current.
@_date: 2018-01-30 00:19:23
Bitcoin stops working. Fortunately there are fees that miners will still collect after all the Bitcoins are found. In the far future the fees for the blocks will be the only thing supporting the network. There will be several layers of functionality by then though and probably most users and transactions will never see the main chain.

They are realize at this point we are trying to ask people to send an e-mail before popular clients like outlook or online services were offering it for free. You could always send mail using your own personal smtp server but most people didn't take the time to learn how. Big improvements will happen they just take time to iron out common user interface, back-end operation is important too and that's what is being hardened now.
@_date: 2018-01-30 05:58:42
I think that channel opening will be a thing for a while then at some point most services and retailers will move to LN. Then there will be ways to conveniently fund your LN wallet, you only transact off chain for large important purchases or cold storage holding. Plus you'll be able to use atomic swaps on LN so you might just be doing transactions with someone and just swapping out coins to have it settled on another cheaper chain if Bitcoin gets too expensive again.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:25:24
That's something to think about though the cap of USDT is about 1.6 billion vs. a 500 billion crypto market. I would be more worried about Coinbase running a fractional reserve because they are the bulk of Bitcoin tx, but so far nobody seems to be up in arms about that. I think Teather is in a tough spot because they want to help crypto exchanges who are unable to work with banks, but at the same time they don't want to share information about their customers unless legally required to. So far they aren't.

@_date: 2018-01-30 04:11:43
No they need a malleability fix and it doesn't have to be Segwit. They only don't want Segwit because Bitmain can use his covert ASIC boost for a mining optimization. 
They can have a fix without segwit, but there is question as to if their devs are talented enough to do the fix on their own. So far the best they came up with on their own was larger blocksize and the enhanced difficulty adjustment that would swing wildly in both directions to try and oscillate miners from Bitcoin to flip the profitability permanently but that never got close. It also gave them a bit of inflation since blocks were being mined so fast during the swings.
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:51:57
Yeah I think BTC price won't be affected by Microsoft news. Bitcoin is a bad payment system for small transactions anyways until LN is adopted, this was always known.

From the desktop, you can try transferring the money in Coinbase to your G-Dax account, you may need to make one first. Gdax is the same company as Coinbase but it is their trading platform, and if you have an account in one you have or can set up a linked account in the other. 
Once on G-Dax you can then transfer any coin free of charge I believe, but they might require a minimum and the .10 USD may be stuck until it is a much larger amount. Another option is to purchase more Bitcoin from Coinbase, transfer it to G-Dax, then transfer that along with your 10 cents to leave the account drained. Last time I used it Coinbase charges you to withdrawal but G-dax covers the outgoing miner fee for you, it should still be the case.
EDIT: you said you already used Coinbase but I would also recommend a different exchange that supports Segwit transfers, support the exchanges that want to evolve Bitcoin.

The value lies in whatever someone is willing to pay for it or use it for. Right now there is lots of speculation because the market is young and price discovery has to happen. You may not buy to avoid inflation or protection, but many others will. I was hearing the useless bubble and tulip mania talk when Bitcoin was $10, $100, $1000, and now $10,000, it comes out most when there are large corrections. There is a value to this technology and one day in the future it will be realized by the masses. Where and when mass adoption happens I cannot control but I do see that the network is getting stronger every day, more and more players are getting involved, and even governments around the world are embracing this new ecosystem. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:03:18
Well, for a currency to matter you don't want something so simple as the washer to destroy it. The washer in this case is a hostile takeover from other greedy humans and known convicted criminals. We haven't seen Bitcoin's final form yet, so far we have already seen Cash's.

@_date: 2018-01-17 17:09:52
I agree with everything you say but I guess I'm on the side that this isn't a crash yet, merely a shakeout. There is too much going on with crypto in general and it is a global phenomenon, I don't think the full bubble has even happened yet. It could be that 20K Bitcoin needs some more Lightning Network adoption, and right now it is moving forward nicely.
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:15:13
I think it has to be everything at some point for it to be adopted. Currency first...gets popular and slows down so it's an investment...gets fast again with LN so it's back to being a currency. Bitcoin has many utilities and they will all need to be showcased for people to feel comfortable trading fiat for it.
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:44:30
You said 'crash' and talked about becoming rich, so it could only be about price. The network has not crashed, the developers have not crashed. The only thing I can assume you meant was price.
@_date: 2018-01-05 00:48:30
Bitcoin is supposed to be completely decentralized, as in anyone can run a node themselves to verify transactions and keep a record of the block chain....BE YOUR OWN BANK. Upping the block size will make running a node less feasible on lower grade hardware and slower internet connections. Nodes are important because they keep the contents of the blockchain and validate the new transactions and new coins the miners mint. They also keep the network online if there are outages in certain parts of the world. Basically more nodes means that the blockchain record is stronger against hacks, network attacks, internet outages, etc. Ideally every user would run their own node. Some less affluent users and more importantly less affluent countries may not be able to continue to run nodes if the hardware/network requirements increase. So if you start to alienate the node operators and what hardware/connections they can use you are beginning to centralize the nodes to certain parts of the world or certain types of users. 
If all you do is raise the blocksize then you don't really force development and users into other scaling solutions like Lightning Network, Schnor signatures, sidechains, etc. The greatest innovator is necessity and keeping the block size in tact basically forces these actions now rather than later when Bitcoin is even more popular and more relied upon. If the block size was upped then everyone would continue on doing what they are doing now to fill up the block sizes in the first place, with no real reason to use new scaling solutions. There are also things like miner spam driving up fees and tx counts that help them gain more BTC per block mined in fees. Bitcoin would probably be fine with a small increase now, though major services still haven't enabled Segwit which *WAS* a blocksize increase, and it would be best if we exhausted all other scaling solutions to ensure that the future node operators are not hampered as much. Also remember that Bitcoin is a very strong network, if there are less nodes it would be more susceptible to attacks and internet outages which it has not yet had to face.
This is a lot to say that the downside is that you are just delaying the inevitable if you don't force the spam, small tx, unnecessary stuff off of the main chain now while we can.

People here are excited about LN and other updates, people there are good at coming up with names like "cripplecoin" and tricking new users to purchase the knock-off. In addition this infighting is causing nothing but disdain for all of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general, and it doesn't look like it is going away anytime soon.

I don't see why not. They would have to have the BTC locked in channel first and have a method to add to the channel as BTC is bought, but adding / topping off a LN channel is possible. It might make more sense like a Coinbase interface and not the GDax exchange, but it should be possible with the right implementation to handle the shuffling of coins around.

It really is a terrible thing for Bitcoin development because it is money, and the potential value is very high for something that can be used by the entire world and is limited in nature. Because of that many who have bought in have an emotional attachment to future riches and they will get frustrated beyond normalcy if they think the value of their investment isn't being protected enough by faster development or what looks like no-brainer upgrades (block sizes). The one's that do understand what every upgrade implicates (devs) are cautious and want to understand everything and do it correctly so that the protocol remains bullet proof. Human nature is going to be the end of Bitcoin over anything in the physical world.

Such is the world we are in, people refuse to look 2 years into the future. Luckily the engineers do and I think it will basically take all of the other alt-coins to get jumped into and they too will refuse to scale properly or get interfered with for being too decentralized, slowed down, bloated, etc. Then look who you can turn back to, that Bitcoin and a few of those Segwit coins have Lightning Network and it works pretty fast and cheap just like my alt did when I switched to it.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:56:07
Maybe you are misrepresenting my position. Bitcoin itself won't and cannot be regulated, the only regulation of Bitcoin is consensus. Those that chose to operate the protocol and connect to the network are free to, and those that don't won't. 
I don't think it will be regulated in the sense that the US Dollar is, where it is legally required to be accepted for all debts public and private. I think it will be regulated more along the lines of how the crypto exchanges in the US currently are, in a matter that integrates companies or services into current societal expectations. If something tries to change consensus through regulation, it by definition won't have consensus and cannot be manipulated in that way. That is one of the features of Bitcoin.
As far as the "crashes", Bitcoin was designed to combat the boom-bust cycles created by the central bank and government manipulation. Right now all of our economic activities are at the whims of the few who control the banks and the laws. Booms and busts are natural forces and I don't think that will be changed, as you said greed is in our nature. The things that will change are crashes like the 2007 housing bubble, the savings and loan bubble, etc. These run-ups and crashes were intentionally done by banks and laws that circumvented basic safety nets to maximize company and personal profits at the expense of society. So while few got rich, the many were left to clean up the mess. Things like this will be minimized if there is an alternative to the current banking system. I don't know if Bitcoin will be that alternative in the long run, but it has a chance to. The people who develop it believe they are doing something to help, and many people are buying into it. There can be a future where the central banks actually are kept in check because of the existence of crypto currencies, that is something to strive for.

The only way to lower difficulty is to have less hashpower (miners looking for blocks), and that would mean the difficulty is slowly adjusted to find the 10-minute per block equilibrium. 
There could always be a hard fork to change this though it is difficult to estimate circumstances that dictate this so far into the future.
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:12:11
The very old Bitcoin used to have unlimited block sizes and services like Satoshi Dice were basically doing this same effect. I think it just goes to show that if it is available to a human it will be used in an unsustainable manner until it is too late. Bitcoin core has taken the approach to force adoption into more sustainable services now rather than later when there are potentially many more users.

I didn't even use Segwit to send to an exchange last week and paid $3 fees, and it went through within 2 blocks. It's not as fast/cheap as most alts still but not nearly as bad as what the complainers make you believe. Just hard to respond to everyone you see so it makes it sound much worse than reality. 
Now, there are times when the mempool is really full then the low fee tx do take up to 24-hours or possibly longer, can't deny that but it's hard to blame Bitcoin when we keep seeing evidence of companies like Coinbase not helping to prioritize efficient block chain usage. Also it is not all the exchanges fault as there are really bad wallets that were designed when Bitcoin was worth much less, so the estimated fees then were actually reasonable but now that Bitcoin is worth so much they are more in USD value. Just a culmination of things and enough people still pay high fees so it drives the prices up if you need it in the next block.

Tethers allow convenient transfer from exchange to exchange when users don't wish to cash into the volatility of any crypto. Transfering USD between exchanges is not possible without cashing out and wiring over, and that's on the off chance they accept USD wire. Tethers also allow many exchanges to exist in the first place since they can't operate with USD or even their local fiat currency, banks are very skeptical when working with crypto companies. Without tether many exchanges wouldn't even exist.
Also there is only one exchange that theoretically will actually cash in your tether for USD (Bitfinex).

I never get tired of seeing these.

I don't think Bitconnect was a surprise to anyone paying attention. If you invested in that it was expected by most that it was a ponzi scheme.

@_date: 2018-01-19 16:32:55
Yes it adds uncertainty to BTC though if someone is paying attention they can tell BCH does not really have anything solved other than short term method for transacting cheap, which many alt-coins currently offer too.

From what I've seen explained their upgrade might be more intensive. Their main chain can handle more tx than Bitcoin but that honestly is not all that impressive. Bitcoin has always been about 7tx per second because of the blocksize and 10-minute block time.

Well yes and no. In time if Segwit gains adoption, exchanges start using better practice, and common transactors move to LN then fees should remain low and there won't be as much of a swing in main-chain tx demand.

Complete speculation but I've seen comments stating that only 6-10B fiat has actually been used to enter this market, so if 2.5B is fake thats over 20%. The exchanges that use tether could be wiped out, and many of the alts would have been propped up by nothing.
After Mt. Gox crashed it was theorized that a single user helped to drive up the price of BTC from $100 to over $1200. There can be a lot of damage done with just a little money because the markets aren't naturally allowed to correct.

Paypal spun off of eBay in 2016 due to investor takeover, they are no longer under the same company. Ebay did purchase Paypal in the mid 2000's and that is what secured Ebay as a trusted sales platform since Paypal could 'protect' buyer and seller payments and insure confidence in the online platform. 
If 2/3rds of the world (I don't remember the exact number) is unbanked then why WOULDN'T ebay want to look into Bitcoin? They would open up their customer base to the entire world rather than just the one's paypal lets in. Ebay successfully adopting cryptocurrency would be in their best interest, of course they will do it when the time is right. As to when though, not sure but maybe something like Lightning or a payment provider like Coinbase could assist the integration.

I wonder if this is why alt-coins will remain a thing over Bitcoin sidechains. What is the value proposition for a company to develop something that needs high fees (on top of an already high fee blockchain comparatively), vs develop your own cheap alt token on another smart contract capable chain, and let that act as the fee. If adoption happens then fees could be adjusted for market tolerance and your wealth via founders tokens grows exponentially. If you need the most secure chain then I guess you would pay the 20% RSK fee, but even POW has competition and while different some other systems might be good enough security for some businesses.

He's right in that your reply was way off the mark. He said "regulatory captured", which means that private interests are so intertwined into government at all levels that they are basically making rules through government backing to enjoy better protection and enriching themselves usually at the detriment of everyone else.

Create it securely and keep the paper safe and it's more secure than any hardware or software wallet today. 
The biggest downside to a paper wallet is spending it, you have to basically spend the whole balance to a new wallet when you are ready just like breaking open a piggy bank. So if you want to spend occasionally then a hardware wallet is probably better, or do a combination of both.

Very good summary, I feel like something like this should be stickied for new users. 
 Also you forgot about covert ASIC boost which Segwit update fixed too. That was being used by the largest miner and producer of miners on the Bitcoin network. So on top of the LN taking away fees, covert ASIC boost was no longer an option for mining more power efficient so it was a double whammy. People love to jump onto the alt-train though they will learn pretty quick about disagreements and delays when there are as serious of financial implications and power holds that Bitcoin can offer.

If Bitmain's intent is to kill BTC via this death spiral, then he is killing his 4 billion yearly profit for something that basically is a black eye in the crypto space. If it were successful and Bitcoin was halted due to hash rate falling off a cliff, then Bcash would not be any sort of safe-haven people would flock to. All of crypto would be set back for years, and the next crypto to take over would probably not be POW. The whole point of Bitcoin game theory is that every participant acts in economic best interest, how does killing all of crypto help his bottom line?

@_date: 2018-06-21 03:05:30
I understand being frustrated about not increasing the block size, but what about the whole idea of consensus needing change in Bitcoin? The whole social agreement of Bitcoin is that a change needs overwhelming consensus, and if a group of developers are able to break Bitcoin by their suggestion/support then isn't all of Bitcoin broken anyways, no matter how big blocks are? A block size increase was also proposed with Segwit 2X and that failed miserably, and was coded so bad it caused a freeze before the fork attempt.
I'm not saying that core developers were correct in their public support of no increase, but so far it seems to be working as I sent a tx earlier today and it got through in next block for 1 sat/byte, the lowest that my wallet will allow. Segwit is getting more adoption than last Nov/Dec and I have a feeling the devs were correct in suspecting spam attacks on the network which also seems to have ceased. Even using the Bitcoin main layer I have never been able to send instantly or even as fast as something like Litecoin, or Nano, or whatever alt has faster send ability. How does increasing the blocksize make Bitcoin faster than Litecoin? In your view a block size increase couldn't even fix something that is already broken on a fundamental protocol level.

The point is that the fork was still powered through specifically without core dev support and incompetent developer(s) was made the lead on the project. All the while they tried to hijack the Bitcoin brand.
If they didn't have core support they should have forked the coin into something different that they could control, like bcash.

It has been pretty amazing lately that some of the impoverished nations have started to embrace cryptocurrency due to necessity (N.

I wasn't discounting the 1 sat/byte but eventually it will go up again as Bitcoin transactions grow. Even at today's low fee it is still too expensive for micro transactions and streaming money, which is what Lightning will enable. It looks like we are saying the same things.
@_date: 2018-03-30 12:42:44
I have to disagree, it was much worse in February but I have no facts to back that up. I think lately it has been more positive overall with Lightning Network updates, Abra, Tom Lee, Africa adoption, etc. Price is price but Bitcoin and the ecosystem are getting stronger every day. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:09:58
You basically hit the nail on the head with your reasoning. Banking and government are too intertwined, there is no separate entity and the powerful banks who control the government do not share any of the societal risk or downside with their practice any longer. When the economy tanks because of poor (and downright illegal) banking practices only focused on short term profits they are then subsequently bailed out by taxpayer dollars, rising inflation, and even outright theft of deposits in some countries. Right now we have technology to mitigate central banks abuse of power by removing authority from our commerce. Therefore if the banks decide to be reckless with their Bitcoin (or whatever the future ends up using) then there will be no one to bail them out, and society can move from a failed bank rather than a now larger consolidated one using the same risky practices that is now too big to fail in the next cycle.

The reward is that people continue to use their service. If tx fees for Shapeshift are $1.00, but we all know that tx are clearing at $0.10, people will still look for something else. There is no 'good enough' in business, it is either used or it isn't. The market participants are always looking for cheaper and faster options. If Shapeshift isn't the cheapest and the fastest they need to know or they will lose customers.

I don't mind Ethereum or any other coin really that is trying to service a need that even Bitcoin doesn't have or might never have in it's development. It is just crazy to me that I see many people completely disregard Ethereum's history with a hack and fork to fix lost funds, their inability to commit to a coin cap, and even new updates that support recovering of lost funds, and they will spout off things like Eth is a better store of value or currency than Bitcoin. Eth is different, but 1 ETH will not always equal 1 ETH as guaranteed in the future. It says a lot about this space and really the world's lack of understanding of how money (even fiat money) operates. I don't know if that is good or bad for Bitcoin but long term probably good as more people wise up. Eth can be completely successful and even overtake Bitcoin in market cap, but it is not a currency that is meant to maintain a store of value of sound money. Problem is it could be a lifetime before problems arise in coins like ETH or faulty POS models that actually make them question things effectively.

The minute you stop complaining is when the other side thinks they are doing OK. Its like when Coinbase came out late last year (long after Segwit sf) and said that Segwit adoption is not even near their top top customer requests. Everyone who supports and uses Bitcoin knew it was THE biggest way to help with the fee problem yet they continued to pretend it wasn't important.
@_date: 2018-03-22 04:55:47
My favorite was when Segwit2X froze it's own network before it even forked. Yeah, and these companies wanted Bitcoin to run off of that code.

Lightning uses the same (or similar?) routing style that TOR does. It should be completely anonymous though it is suspected that TOR can be compromised with the proper resources. Even then you'd have to be somebody worthwhile to put in the effort.
@_date: 2018-03-06 00:29:24
Well if they are batching then I suspect Shapeshift is collecting some of the extra. It's not difficult to monitor the fee market and put through a tx fee that is going to get picked up in the next block. 
If everyone pays $1 on a large batch with 100 tx Shapeshift probably isn't giving $100 to the miners fee when 10 cent transactions are clearing.

Ok been one month since this call and it's at 11K today, pretty far above your estimate. To be fair it did dip lower but unless you bought in at 6K you probably didn't play the bottom right, and it happened so fast and you had such a bearish tone I'm not sure you would have even bought at all last month. Now if you want to re-buy at 11K its a 3K improvement in price for you, or do you sit out longer and still wait for sub 8K possibly even 2-5K that many were preaching?
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:32:44
Fees of 2-6 satoshis/byte are clearing in the next block, just like before the hype. In addition to lower volume, Segwit starting to take effect, more pressure for exchanges to batch, people are being better about efficient block chain usage. This in addition to Lightning Network rolling out (hit 500 nodes on mainnet) will help fees remain low and fast in the future. People act like Bitcoin devs don't do anything but in fact there is more going on in Bitcoin than the last 3 years, mainly due to delay of Segwit for...reasons.

My favorite was at the Davos summit they had a whole section about Bitcoin and crypto. They are worried about it for sure because it is a legitimate threat to the status quo and how countries perform commerce. They don't like to change to things they have no control over, but as you said they can't shut it out (if they could anyways) otherwise they will be left behind in the future.
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:39:42
Nice to say with hindsight and all, we all felt the run-up was too much but it is a fact that you yourself could not tell me weather the top was 8K, 12K, 20K, or even possibly more if it went. Why also was 4K not the top from 1K? What if you sold out during the run-up at 5K like many people because that was too fast? You would have lost out on almost 4K (in paper) even after this most recent correction. Maybe they did buy in later and are now negative, maybe they didn't and will never touch Bitcoin again because it is above their first buy-in price. How much in taxes will you have to pay for trading at the top then rebuying in again, could you even buy back as much as you'd like after paying taxes? Most people in r/bitcoin (and in general) are not traders, so part of the community adopts the HODL mentality indicating that they don't know the future other than we still think nothing has changed fundamentally in Bitcoins operational ability and it is still moving forward in it's progression. So while there can be successful traders we generally advise not to invest more than you can afford to lose, that way when the price crashes hard you don't have to try and time the market to save your investment if the reason you bought was for long term outlook.
For everyone who is a 'fool' for not selling at top of a frothy market as you say, there are plenty of others who sold out early then bought in too late, and probably sold again lower than the bounce we are currently at. There is no way to accurately predict Bitcoin's price from hour to hour, day to day, or even month to month. Maybe timing the markets are your thing, but pretending that everyone else can easily do the same is what is foolish. Tell me how long the correction will last and what the price next month will be and I might believe in your market reading skills too.
@_date: 2018-03-16 12:55:30

@_date: 2018-02-06 22:07:01
It is a guessing game and the early adopters will be handsomely rewarded. I think Bitcoin will remain a major player because it has proven itself as secure, it is still being worked on by the best people in the space, it has a large ecosystem already and more pieces being added every day (ATMs, exchanges, futures, liquidity, apps, etc). It is also one of the simpler blockchains but now onto building its 2nd layer that allows tons more features and better scaling. I like to use the examples of how the internet built out, it was never the best technology in every scenario but it just kept chugging along because it had people supporting it and working to upgrade the system they were in at that point. For example when audio/video was not streamable they worked on compression rather than a new sending protocol to handle more bandwith. With Bitcoin it's the same thing, there are challenges for upgrading but people tend to find it easier to integrate rather than start from scratch. Bitcoin has also already proven it's value as digital gold in that people are fine with buying to hold for a later date. 
Yes any coin could technically just copy Bitcoin and many do, but look at what happened to Bitcoin Cash. It has not taken off even though it's basically the same exact copy and even had the same exact users when it forked off. Not the same number of users, the same exact users that Bitcoin had and they all understood how to use it. On top of that it has pretty much the same name. At some point the plethora of coins will just be ignored and people will start to build off of the Bitcoin protocol. There is a gold rush right now so it is too lucrative to just add to Bitcoin, I think that will tire down eventually.
@_date: 2018-03-02 17:35:54
This is the only reason but they will try their best to say things like Bitcoin is slow, expensive, old tech, etc. It may be some of those things some times, but your ALT wouldn't even exist if Bitcoin did not grow to scale and need to improve on those things int he first place. They completely discount the constant attacks on Bitcoin via network, hack attempts, hard forks, socially, from the media, from crypto exchanges, from banks, etc. No coin has or will ever face this amount of backlash and Bitcoin is just blazing trails where no trail was thought possible and it is making the road easier for all of them.

Digital blockchain assets are a new class but in the case of Bitcoin we look to gold for some signs. It differs in that it has more utility than gold as it is unseizable, easily transferrable, and easily accessible with any number of devices connected to the internet anywhere in the world. The gold market cap is worth about 7 trillion, and the offshore banking industry (quick google search is 10% worldwide GDP). It is reasonable to estimate that in just those two use cases alone Bitcoin could chip away at some market cap of gold and off-shore banking. Even more if Bitcoin becomes a commonly accepted currency which developments are already underway to speed up and reduce transaction fees, making them more convenient for smaller purchases. 50K-70K per Bitcoin puts it about 1/5th the size of gold market cap, and it almost got there on the last run-up. After that you'd need to see serious use case of digital currency and evidence of people hiding their money from taxation to start serious growth.

So do central banks and the fiat supply. What is your point?
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:56:38
Bitcoin is about taking control away from central banks, wall street banks, government, and their corruption. The same banks that are too big to fail invest recklessly at the detriment to society while sharing none of the risk. The amount of "certainty" you mention will change depending on how big the next bailout needs to be. National debt is at an all time high and there is not one ounce of sound monetary policy being mentioned by our leaders. Government borrows more, they tax more, and they drain social services all at the behest of their donors who are...well they aren't working in your best interest right now. Your money in the bank is at risk of theft from inflation, state seizure due to KYC or even banks discretion, or even deposit bailouts as we have seen in other countries. 
Bitcoin is not perfect monetary policy, it is sound money. You can know with certainty there will never be more than 21 million Bitcoin, and we can estimate the rate at which it is mined. It is something introduced as an alternative to central banks and fiat system that we haven't had before, it can act as a check on their recklessness if it's popularity grows. Valve and other companies have gone on record stating that Bitcoin is too volatile, that will decrease the more value overall it is given. It is too early for Bitcoin to be used as a day to day currency, the technology is being upgraded to allow for that. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:31:38
You see this piling on a lot when the price is correcting, but the people that understand this technology know that it is only a matter of time before mass adoption happens.

I agree with you but am a believer that some money might move into crypto for the reason it has proven to be secure, it is still a growth industry, real estate is hard to purchase in smaller exact amounts, and even buying gold is pretty questionable as to what you own when you purchase from the stock market.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:06:04

Everything will be a failure in their minds, most of them seem to want a centralized coin that does not need separate nodes and relies on the miners and businesses for all verification.

It says "Lightning" in the title and the instructions look like they are for the Bitcoin-Core full node and a Lightning Network node. I think if you are running a Lightning node you need to open a channel with a small balance of Bitcoin so that you can connect out and others can connect to your node.

This mania is actually normal (somewhat) in crypto.

Sounds like you played it as perfect as you could. Understand though if you want to try and time buying and selling based off of market macros than the HODL meme isn't for you. This is a young market with a lot of noobie investors, they are more than likely to make mistakes on timing until they have an understanding for market sentiment, they are the one's that are fattening up your stack with buying and selling at the wrong times. They sell low when there is a non-factor causing a dip, or buy high with FOMO, cycle repeats over and over. If everyone actually followed the moves like you then the market would be completely different. There is a reason why Warren Buffet suggests buy and hold index funds over stock picking for regular people, and it's the same reason why r/bitcoin recommends HODL over trading to maximize profits. *MOST* people (especially in this space) don't have the ability to be right all the time so if their investment outlook is long term then buying and holding, dollar cost averaging, or adding onto the dips for a few years will outweigh the performance of trading in shorter timelines.

It has no leader, or company driving it's development, only a shared consensus on all parties involved (developers, miners, users) on how it will move forward. Currencies that have a unified leader or group are easier to influence through social or even violent ways. If there is going to be a worldwide currency that gets some sort of mass adoption (not necessarily replace all fiat transactions just common enough that almost everybody knows about it), then it is likely to be the most neutral so that every one has common ground. IE -
 people in Switzerland may not want to adopt some currency that is only developed in the USA as they might make developmental decisions that benefit people in the USA more. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:16:23
I can't stand that sub. Everyone is so sure that ETH is going to take over Bitcoin and once it does then Bitcoin will just die and roll over and stop innovating. And already it died because it didn't innovate with a block size increase to save it's customers tx time (how they put it). They seriously have no understanding of the fundamental differences between ETH and Bitcoin. 
I'm no sage, and ETH could very well overtake Bitcoin in cap looking at current trends, but if it does it's not like it would stop anything from happening on Bitcoin. They are two different blockchain models at the base that serve different purposes.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:58:02

I don't know that big banks were/are buying in yet themselves, but especially not near 1-4K range. There were some investment firms (not Sacks, JPM or the likes) getting in around 5K I remember reading about, but even earlier in the year Bitcoin was still very much speculative and questionable. At some point though Bitcoin will be big and the large banks and even countries will own some. It really has a mind of it's own with some game theory mixed in. It's a tradable asset not controlled by anyone, and that has power and utility of ultimate trust in the system. I mean, even investment banks need to work with each other in a system that nobody can cheat, otherwise the competition wins and in that world when the competition wins you are absorbed or CEO's are kicked out. Never before in history have we had the opportunity for trustless payments without the oversight of a central bank or governing body, this technology is so revolutionary that it won't stay unadopted for long now that the cat is out of the bag. There will be price manipulation as you say, there probably already is to some point, but in the long term when price is much higher it will be harder to manipulate in the same way. It will just be a bumpy ride to the future.
I feel bad for some of the sellers but there is a rule in crypto that you only invest what you can afford to lose. If you took loans out or bought too much at 19K then you didn't do your research, and you weren't prepared for up to 90% losses which has happened before. Bitcoin has had 4-5 large bubbles and crashes already in it's 9 years, but with each crash the price has recovered to unimaginable heights beyond the previous high. Many people that buy into Bitcoin though aren't as concerned about the day to day price more so than the benefits of future adoption and what a free monetary system can do for society. In addition, in the history of Bitcoin you have never had to worry about a compromise to the system. Every single crash has been cause by some sort of failure in the ecosystem built around Bitcoin, never with Bitcoin itself. It has always worked as designed, and even in todays crash there was nothing really other than it ran up too fast and we've had an entire month of FUD after FUD in a jittery market that has probably topped for a bit. Bitcoin isn't perfect though, it needs updating from time to time and faces challenging adoption hurdles, but the people that work on Bitcoin and the core users running nodes, submitting bugs, testing lightning network, etc., all have a stake in it's success. They all have a chance to change the world. Even just owning Bitcoin is proving your belief in it's transformative powers. Because of the limited supply of 21 million there is a lot of speculation (from myself included) that the distant future price will be much higher than it is today. 
As for WHY people are doing it? Some are just in for a quick buck or gambling on short term price swings, some for the chance to be apart of something transformative, some are a mix of both they come for the gains but stay for the revolution. I see post after post how people bought Bitcoin because they learned about high price rising but then learned about it, read Satoshi's whitepaper, etc., and held through the next crash because they too understood. I started out with Bitcoin because I liked the fact that I had complete control over my money, that was a power I could take back in world where we continually see rights taken away by corrupt leaders. Your economical speech is protected by the blockchain, and only the protocol determines what happens.

There will probably not be one coin to rule them all in the future, it will likely be a mixture of coins that serve different purposes. In our case Bitcoin aims to be a currency coin and store of value, like easily spendable gold. 
I did forget to mention (and it's Bitcoin's best feature) that Bitcoin is the most decentralized currency. There are no leaders driving the ship, there is only consensus between developers, users (includes node operators), and miners. Most other coins have companies or leaders driving the ship, which is good for quickly making changes but that also means there is a centralized point of weakness. For example, Ethereum is a great coin and offers a lot of features that Bitcoin may never have. It is not directly comparable to Bitcoin though because it was never created as a currency coin. Ethereum has had hacks before because of it's complicated nature, and their blockchain was rolled back. So someone looking into storing value may not want to pick Ethereum as there is a possibility of the chain being modified in the future for a reason you don't agree with. Large entities that are looking to enter the space may not choose Ethereum as there are additional risks not associated with Bitcoin. 
At the end of the day you need to research what you are putting your money into.
@_date: 2018-02-23 17:48:16
It's important to remember that what is obvious to you is not obvious to someone else. Especially with Bitcoin there are reasons such as misunderstanding or lack of understanding, denial to keep the status quo, desire to retain power and/or influence. Bitcoin is not treading lightly in it's quest for world domination of sound money and there is still a long road towards mass acceptance. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:34:18
I know I don't understand this argument. Yes in 2013 you could have sold at 1K, put your money in something else for 2 years, then got into Bitcoin again before the next run up.
If you do this you HAVE to actually time the markets. You have to know when to sell your 'traditional' investment and put it into crypto. What if your 'traditional' investment lost money though? Houses and stocks lost a ton in 2008, it's looking like there could be a repeat to some effect soon enough. Every investment has risk and only hindsight ever guarantees making the right choices. I spend long enough enough tracking Bitcoin and crypto (for fun/enjoyment), its my 'extra' investment money after 401K, house payment, emergency savings, etc. If I spent any longer studying regular stocks or assets in addition to tracking crypto to know when it's a good time to enter/exit, well then I'd need more time in the day and I would be a fucking genius who beat both markets consistently. Most people don't beat markets, and they aren't geniuses in one thing let alone two. 
If you believe that Bitcoin will be part of a global currency that many people will use for transaction and wealth storage, then buying some now is better than buying some in the future. I just keep it simpler that way and don't really worry about these corrections and just buy some more.

I don't know if it's an obsession but it is technically full Segwit to use a bech32 address. Wallets such as Electrum that support full Segwit give out bech32 addresses (prefix bc1). From my understanding Segwit addresses that begin with a "3" share some properties of a Segwit tx though do not fully segregate witness data, sort of like a crutch or transition option. Many services that claim they support Segwit do not actually recognize bech32 addresses for sending to, and it is a pain for those that use Electrum Segwit addresses.

Unfortunately I think most of the level headed folks on Bitcoin side have made up their mind around the time of split and want to focus their energy on making Bitcoin better, and for good reason. It takes a lot of effort to always be on the defensive and keep explaining the confusion that Bcash likes to create. There also hasn't really been much development I'm aware of for Bcash that they can promote, so they tend to focus on attack to stay relevant which in turn makes people who are always on the defensive lash back. It's not right, but I understand why some choose this tactic even when it doesn't do any favors to Bitcoin community. Another problem with this whole mess that if there is confusion about Bitcoin no side really wins, but at the same time it seems to be their biggest strength so they use it with impunity not really thinking about long term effects.

We are probably 5+ years off from any crypto being used as a currency in the traditional sense. Bitcoin is the most decentralized and censorship resistant so it has the best shot at mainstream adoption. Also to be used as a currency the price has to stabilize, for that to happen it has to be much higher. In the meantime all you can do is learn about, contribute to it, and speculate on it's usage.

The network effect of Bitcoin is pretty powerful compared to other cryptos. You aren't adopting the technology per se, more like the network of players buying into the system (miners securing it, developers working on it, users keeping it decentralized).

The problem is precisely that people think there is validity to both sides that deserve equal discussion, on a similar peg to climate change scientists vs. deniers. When one coin's whole existence is to confuse and obfuscate through social media and other 3rd party Bitcoin services it starts to wear on people. All that Bcash has ever done is take the Bitcoin code, add some modifications to try and steal hash power (security) from Bitcoin network, claim that they have Bitcoin in their name, and publicly shame Bitcoin users and developers without ever producing anything of value. It has never been about promoting Bitcoin Cash or the improvements over Bitcoin for them. Tons of alts transfer faster and cheaper than Bitcoin (there can be many reasons for this) but there is generally not any hate for those coins as they are working to promote their coin through use and functionality.

There are many instances where blockchain can replace a database, but it is not actually needed. That is the problem with current companies' understanding, they think they need to adopt blockchain but in reality they are already successful at what they are doing without it. In that case they are just fitting a square peg into a round hole. 
There are projects though that blockchain is preferential, it is mainly needed when trust between two parties is required but not guaranteed. So far one of the best cases for blockchain is Bitcoin. I think the space is still in it's infancy like when the internet was being developed so it is hard to see exactly where it will end up. As far as Bitcoin it will mostly affect people who live in less than ideal conditions due to strict government controls or lack of financial access. The idea is that when everyone is on a level field the world will look much different. If it adopts in more stable countries it will be because of distrust in the current financial system, which there is plenty of these days.

You can do what you want, I can't tell you all your money is going to OK. Ask yourself based off of world events what the future of finance is going to be? We've had 40+ years of banking scandals in western countries perpetuated by boom bust cycles that have only rewarded elite by handouts from governments and central banks. The big players have profited off of society in the booms, then again on the bailouts by sharing none of the risk or downside. There is no wrong they can do because it will all be forgiven with your tax dollars or bank accounts. They do not want to change the status quo one bit.
Now we have a technology that can mitigate their control. Bitcoin is a check on their system (still in it's infancy yes, but a check nonetheless). It is a way for regular people to safely store their money without risk of seizure or state theft or negative interest rates. It is value that is easy to transact with with no controlling party completely outside of their toolbox of control. They can't attack it, they can't hack it, they can't put it's creator in jail, they can't shut it down. The only tool they have left is to buy up and control some of Bitcoin and play along to make sure they have something in this game too. If you sell then you are giving up some of your future influence to save your fiat value today. Best thing you can do even when you are down 50%...look at the charts and zoom out.

I don't get the inflation eating into poor's savings either, poor people don't have savings. What Bitcoin and crypto will do (assuming enough people adopt) is change the current rules of inflation and take away power from central banks who have their fingers intertwined into government at all levels. Once they can no longer print money at will through inflation and taxpayer bailouts, the boom/bust cycles that further destroy our economies and help consolidate power to the top will no longer be possible. There will still be booms and busts but they will not be artificially inflated with the backing of taxpayer dollars, and the companies that fail will really go bust with Bitcoin and cannot come back. You cannot bail out failed banks if there is no more Bitcoin to print. Banks will then tighten their lending practices and only give money to people they actually think will pay back, they will stop investing people's savings in highly complicated derivatives that may or may not have an actual backing, and the cycle of endless consumerism which takes massive tolls on our society and planet could be reigned in. 
There are benefits to a Bitcoin/crypto backed economy that we need to consider beyond inflation control.

I think the tactics like with Bitcoin.com,  twitter handle, etc., are really what grinds people. Bcash in general marketing seems to use deception to trick new users into thinking Bcash is Bitcoin. Now a new user could start buying Bcash but not be able to transact with another user with Bitcoin. They are so similar in tech though incompatible, when you try to keep the same name and same social presence it only adds to the confusion and will only turn people off. It is just generally not good for Bitcoin and crypto as a whole. Many other Bitcoin forks kept Bitcoin in the name and there isn't any of those problems.

Weird because I thought BCH was formed after Jihan was ousted for using covert asic boost and to keep mining without the Segwit malleability fix, and at the same time spam the network to help push the bigger blocks now narrative to further delay Segwit. 
Segwit is now implemented and gaining adoption by major players, and spam suddenly stopped a few months ago for reasons we can only speculate. Bitcoin didn't actually need larger blocks right now as I can send tx in the next block for 1 satoshi/byte. The "core" of Bitcoin population you speak of seems to only care about low tx fees and disregards decentralization and capable developers.

Because of Bitcoin we are able to collectively circumvent or at minimum minimize this type of manipulation for those that wish to participate in the new economy.

I think if Bitcoin gets that popular and priced high enough, then early adopters will spend (because that is why they invested in the first place), and enough businesses would start accepting Bitcoin because they prefer it to fiat for various reasons. There will always be people who don't adopt in, and Bitcoin doesn't actually need the whole world to use it just a big enough portion to where the value doesn't fluctuate so wildly. At that point too Bitcoin would not be as volatile and the people looking to grow their wealth would have to turn towards something else. Bitcoin would just be your boring deflationary currency where it might earn 2% a year.

This is the biggest point of pain I have myself with some of Bitcoin's hate. 
I think the electricity used is worth the financial sovereignty Bitcoin provides. It is probably far less than what banks and credit processors and paper producers and branches and server farms and security firms and fuel and on and on and on that the normal system uses day to day. 
Then you can look at the human consumption problem and I never see any hate about eating meat, flying in airplanes, purchasing shit trinkets from overseas, new phones and PC's and TV's every year, etc. Everything about our advanced societies demands power and resources and it will never reduce though we can use more efficient and sustainable practices over time. Bitcoin is also probably going to help drive the adoption to solar, and hydro, and geothermal alternatives quicker than anything we have now, yet people get so hung up on the power consumption for mining because it sounds like a big number. They forget to look at their own lives and see how everyone can contribute in a positive way by reducing meat consumption, purchasing local food, biking more, smarter consumption, etc., but it's always someone else that's doing the damage and easy to lay the blame.

Plus as you can see via Paypal, Coinbase too, once you capture someone's money they will tend to keep/spend/secure it with you. These apps are not even apps anymore they are full fledged banks that the younger generation is comfortable using. I'm not endorsing square as an investment but I do use the cash app to buy Bitcoin once in a while and I like how it works.

Thank god I was getting worried we might miss it.

There's no such thing as free lunch. Fees, mining, block times, etc., were placed there by design to keep the network functioning and secure. Free tx will open them up to spam attacks when it becomes profitable, and there are unknown security risks due to the DAG structure over a more battle tested traditional blockchain. I have some NANO myself but it is by no means secure and trusted, Bitcoin has been working exactly as intended for about 9 years.

Which sucks because we are all supposed to be on the same side...the enemy is the banks but good o'l Roger had to butt himself in the middle of all this disruption.

If BTC hits 100K the last thing I would be worried about is tx fees LOL. Even still, it is possible at some point in the future and hopefully by then things like channel factories, Schnor signatures, and further advancement of Lightning Network and atomic swaps (being able to onboard to LN and transact with Bitcoin via Litecoin and Vertcoin who are extremely cheap to transact), and even other sidechains will eventually push most things off of main chain. Its a lot more to do yes, but scaling this way using many solutions will allow people (and ultimately the software) to be flexible with how they transact and even which coins they transact with.
When you look at how technology progresses it is usually something constantly building on top of something else because it just works easier that way. Something like Nano would still need to be proven, then bootstrapped as a currency. I think Bitcoin is much further along in terms of adoption only due to first mover advantage and it's mostly decentralized nature that almost every other coin cannot really claim (development, nodes, not so much mining right now but it is going to get better).

And when large banks start closing their doors due to insolvency, and central banks crank up the printing presses, and when negative inflation becomes normal, and when emergency bailouts on savings deposits are mandated by law...All these things have happened before and all of them will happen again. The real question at that point is who wouldn't park their money into something like Bitcoin? It may fluctuate but you know for a fact your fiat will be worth less and at risk of state seizure to protect the banking system. At some point people collectively will accept that Bitcoin and crypto currency is a better system that does not succumb so easily to human intervention. It does need some time to mature though, but building a new monetary system for humanity doesn't happen overnight.

I don't have the article links but recently Wyoming have come out and said they will accept crypto payment for taxes, and Arizona has a bill in the works. Already too you see articles that you can purchase houses and property with Bitcoin. This is all a small start but the Bitcoin network effect is growing, at some point stores and property managers and bars will accept Bitcoin too.

If you don't have access to your keys then they aren't your Bitcoin, same as a bank it's an IOU. I'm not saying they will but Coinbase could get hacked, they could freeze your account, etc. In all the history of Bitcoin and crypto it is always advised to store your own keys for the long term. 
There's lots of ways to have offline access and that's what I'd recommend. Storing on a Windows PC is also unsafe.

The preview memes are better than the actual memes they tease. Meta.

While not immediate the effect would just be that banks tighten their lending standards for people that will actually use and re-pay the money. As long as you can pay it back it's not an issue, eventually though the irresponsible people will not get loans for homes/cars/credit/etc., and that should have a positive impact in society as a whole. 
I honestly could care less if Ford was unable to hit quarterly numbers because less could get loans, this endless consumeristic society cannot last forever.

First you look into how central bank money is created/managed/abused through co-mingling of politics and human greed, then you look into Bitcoin and decide that it is a more free open value system that does not care about political affiliation, war, or aggression towards towards dissenters. You either use Bitcoin and follow the same rules that everyone else agrees to, or you don't and move on. Some of us real believers can sound pretty crazy but at the same time we are comfortable in supporting a future with a choice that many didn't ever have in the first place through legacy finance.

I can hardly wait. I vividly remember 9K being such a memesplosion that all the meme creators completely blew all their creativity on the Vegata 9K memes, and then 10K hit like 2 days later and nobody had anything to say about it. Hopefully people have 10 and 12K's queued up this time so as not to miss those golden opportunities.

Money, assets, land, Bitcoin, paper gold, even physical metals probably wouldn't be worth anything in that scenario. Only water, food, guns, and bullets would be worth hoarding/trading. Grid down and society collapses, perhaps when rebuilding starts back up in 100 years something like gold could get to be exchangeable again. Bitcoin is designed to survive the end of banks and help advance society. It probably would be the most resilient currency to the end as there are miners and nodes all over the world keeping it alive, but it probably also won't last through a total grid failure event.

This is like the new time traveller, or perhaps the same person?

I saw that too, could be the wrong build they linked I bet it gets fixed soon enough.
