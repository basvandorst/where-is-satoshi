The feels!

It's quite possible.

yeah, my fat fingers hit the link on my mobile when I was trying to scroll. it opened a new browser window and I closed immediately. Are there any precautions I should/can take to protect a mobile device?

I anticipate a gigantic class action lawsuit in the coming months. The guy literally just challenged the public sue him. Some lawyer out there is going to take this personal and fuck him sideways.

I had and still keep a stoploss order at $10k. I’m not convinced this is over yet. If my stoploss is hit, my buy order is double what I currently have invested at $8501.

I clicked it on a mobile before immediately closing it. What are my options?

It's already at $16,472. Probably going to hit $17k before lunch.

I have a substantial wire stuck pending in GDAX right now. As soon as it clears, I'll be making 1 final BTC purchase and then moving everything to Gemini for all future trades. Also, I was considering using the coinbase vault but fuck that. Shit's going straight to cold storage.

Remember, remember the 12th of November!
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:38:22
Is this legit?

I'm in the same boat. Submitted a transaction at midnight moving 1BTC from my wallet to coinbase with a b1,961 fee. I am new to this and don't really know what to think at this point. Any advice is greatly appreciated

How nice. I’ve never had Gold or Silver. Looking forward to trying it. Happy holidays!
