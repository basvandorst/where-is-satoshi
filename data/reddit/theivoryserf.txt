There's also the constant drag that the whole thing is bullshit when you're doing it. So I have to pay 30% when I change to fiat, plus a percentage on each trade that got me there? How much has my sovereign government facilitated these gains? Not hugely. I'm fine with paying some to keep social infrastructure rolling, but at a certain point they're asking for (legal) evasion.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:09:45
Why is Bitcoin better than its many competitors? It's only trajectory is down...
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:04:12
It's going to be beaten by other coins way before it scales.

@_date: 2018-01-31 06:49:35
Why would Bitcoin go up again
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:18:50
If you left it in a bank you could draw a decent wage off it for the rest of your life.
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:12:35
'cuck' = you're a moron
Bitcoin Cash is as bad as Bitcoin. That's like debating between AskJeeves and AltaVista
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:51:05

@_date: 2018-01-31 17:01:50
Really? Ven ain't down
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:45:45


What does Bitcoin do better than its competitors? 
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:47:18
Just trying to help people not lose money
@_date: 2018-01-25 01:30:28


@_date: 2018-01-31 07:22:45
He's right. Bitcoin is old news
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:07:00
I'm in on Vechain too. Good call. COSS also, but a little more of a long shot.
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:44:36
Yep. All Bitcoin has is network effect and public knowledge. Functionally it's poor. It really is MySpace in the Facebook age.
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:47:36
Correct. Most recent Bitcoin investors probably never heard of Ethereum even
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:06:44
Why is Bitcoin better than its competitors
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:48:10
Why do you think Bitcoin will be worth more? It's going to be outstripped this year.
@_date: 2018-01-25 01:27:05
For now.
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:04:19
Except that gold has been desirable for hundreds of thousands of years. Bitcoin is filled with 'get rich' idiots 
@_date: 2018-01-28 01:24:38
Well I agree, but I'm just saying that theoretically it could definitely last your entire life
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:48:50
LN is pointless. It'll probs never work well and competitors are already so much quicker/more private.
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:45:21
Doubt it. Bitcoin is getting surpassed in all areas.
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:49:15
Probably never heard of other cryptos and FOMOed
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:44:55
Very much right. Bitcoin will be dead by 2020.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:02:13
Why do you think it's a dip? What does Bitcoin do better than other coins?
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:21:51
Sooner or later it'll go down for good. Outdated tech
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:50:29
Investing in Bitcoin in late 2017 is like investing in MySpace in 2008
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:14:58
It certainly takes part in it. If more people want tulips the tulip price goes up - so make tulip memes. Ignoring the fact that (allegorically) it's a bit of a shit flower
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:33:19
Haha OK
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:31:39
There will always be 'could have beens'. We must learn to appreciate the present
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:00:09
Yeah you're right. MySpace and AskJeeves will never be replaced by shitsites
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:25:16
I definitely agree.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:31:06
buy the 20 year dip
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:51:48
Exactly. It's a 'get rich scheme', not useful technology in and of itself. It will be replaced within five years
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:24:54
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:25:58
Hint: very few people are in Bitcoin for the tech right now
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:16:43
I mean, that's implied
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:02:18
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:22:41
Perhaps. But I think Bitcoin is potentially too inferior to newer movers. You could say 'if users leave AOL, they'll also leave text messages for a newer messaging service'.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:56:29
Remember this is the legitimate currency of the future **not** a Ponzi scheme
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:30:43
until it crashes hard
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:07:24
Guilty. But not without reason, in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:08:38
the quicker the people learn that Bitcoin could be Myspace/AOL/Yahoo the better
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:08:07
yeah bitcoin is gonna die by 2020 tbf
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:36:06


say goodbye to that when the bubble pops mate

Sooner or later Bitcoin will be replaced - it's shite
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:20:50
Sounds healthy!
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:02:40
Until it doesn't
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:06:34
I was in Bitcoin until very recently. Glad I'm out - useless as a currency. Regressing in terms of acceptance. Slow, expensive, surviving by getting dumb, greedy money of people who don't understand the technology and will flee at the first sign of panic. Ie a massive fucking bubble
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:36:39
''Nexus seeks to Free humankind from centralized systems. Merely being decentralized is not enough. We must decentralize the decentralization. '

@_date: 2017-12-08 12:05:06
Who said anything about Bcash? If you have to defend with deflection you should be concerned. What does Bitcoin do better than most upcoming altcoins?
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:23:36
Pump and dump.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:55:16
yeah, move somewhere without it mate
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:41:43
How will it ever have increased liquidity when most are speculating on the price and the network is slow and expensive?
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:05:04
No it wasn't, I've held for 5 years and Bitcoin is palpably shite now.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:55:37
Yup, I was joking. Bitcoin is crap as currency, I've moved out of it in the last year
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:35:19
Both, which I think is fine. When I stopped believing in the project I sold, at a large profit.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:24:27
It's being manipulated. People don't believe in the coin, they're trying to make a quick buck. Recipe for disaster.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:23:34
I'm not, I sold. The project has lost its head
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:11:25
or, you know, a good cryptocurrency
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:26:24
People here don't care about anything but price - which is exactly why Bitcoin will eventually fall. And it won't be pretty
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:22:55


*Why there's going to be a monumental crash in the next few months*
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:09:26
still pretty damn good
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:40:09
i don't know either. I think there's a strong possibility of a heavy Bitcoin crash that hurts crypto for years.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:56:03
Absolutely. I'll be glad to see Bitcoin fail now I see the people still holding - mainly greedy and under-informed.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:32:02
Look at this sub. BTC is getting worse as a currency as the price skyrockets. Definition of a bubble and some people might get hurt soon
Edit: selling now is not 'panic selling', it could be banking an insane profit in an immensely volatile market
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:54:49
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:00:09
I've just got fully out of BTC and feel much better for it. All it has is brand recognition at this point. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:19:36
This is such an obvious time to cash in and leave. Bitcoin is slow and expensive - almost all altcoins are better. Steam has dropped payments and support is actually regressing while the price skyrockets. There is a huge amount of dumb money pumping Bitcoin up to an extent I don't think we've seen before. Lots of people are trying to make a quick buck with no understanding of crypto or attachment to it. Big players are trying to manipulate the market now. Buy some altcoins now for the love of god.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:15:35
It was superseded by better competition 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:02:19
D'you think Google would be a thing if AltaVista never existed?
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:33:47
Not the entire raison d'etre of this sub at all
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:03:52
I was in Bitcoin for six and a half of those years. While the fundamentals improved and infrastructure got better, it justified the price rise. Now it's forgotten any pretence at being a currency. It's slow, expensive and not future-ready. Being pumped by big players for a short. Get out soon.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:52:04
Bitcoin will be dead in five years
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:59:05
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:03:15
lol Bitcoin is MySpace
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:24:35
Personally I think creativity is the key. If I can eat and I have a guitar I'll be OK. People need an outlet of self-worth that isn't material, imo. Easy to say of course, and money does make a difference to quality of life
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:21:03
And then the bubble bursts
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:04:17
What about IOTA?
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:54:15
Yup. Sort of works, sort of sucks, but first. Will be surpassed by better coins.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:40:48
It takes part in the ponzi scheme, which is to convince more people to buy in 'to get rich'. What is Bitcoin useful for?
 Who care! Seriously, look at the posts. Does that look like stable money to you?
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:56:38
Yep, still very early days though - like BTC in 2010 sorta thing
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:13:43
Well, obviously we see things differently. Best of luck!
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:34:37
Nice counterargument. Bitcoin is a dead currency being pumped

@_date: 2017-12-07 11:22:01
What does Bitcoin do that altcoins don't do much better now? It's surviving on brand recognition and idiot hype at the moment and will soon come tumbling down
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:32:28

Cryptomarkets. Bitcoin is being pumped hard for a short right now.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:13:44
Haha this is exactly what I mean. Steam has just stopped accepting Bitcoin - price doesn't mean shit if the basic functionality is actually going backwards. This whole sub is just speculation from people who've never read the white paper. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:44:04
I concur! Will be interesting to see how it crumbles either way
@_date: 2017-02-12 16:39:16


No...but Bitcoin is a gamble.
@_date: 2017-03-22 09:45:02

@_date: 2017-03-10 17:08:09
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:40:19
Absolutely, I find this really hard to believe. It's sad if your parents wouldn't respect you at your word at all about something they know nothing about, let alone randomly disposing of the item (!). My parents would *sound* very skeptical but they'd definitely take me seriously if I impressed it upon them.
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:51:49
This seems fake to me.
@_date: 2017-01-18 05:32:11
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:44:43
You wouldn't casually say it sarcastically though...you'd explain very seriously what the scenario was and tell them to Google 'BTC USD'.

I feel sorry for this dude that lives in the sitcom world of contrived misunderstandings.
'Hi mum. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency stored on hard drives, and this may well contain a lot of them. If you Google BTC USD you'll see they're worth over 4000 dollars a piece, and there could be hundreds on the drive. I need you to please store it somewhere safe, in the very possible scenario that this currency is contained there. Sounds crazy, but I am not joking.'

@_date: 2017-08-17 17:38:11
Too many crumbs
@_date: 2016-11-04 13:57:15
Let me be clearer - I'm a left-leaning social democrat with sympathy for civil libertarianism. I think there is a place for a decentralised currency. if not as people's day to day money.

Precisely. No point buying until there's a single sign we're out of bear. Which we there isn't, and public sentiment towards Bitcoin is awful.
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:11:59
Bitcoin holder from 2012-mid 2018 - it still sucks ass as a currency. Like, it's literally worsened in terms of speed, cost and adoption.

The past doesn't necessarily repeat itself forever.

@_date: 2018-11-26 23:45:30
You're presuming that Bitcoin is the predestined future. I think that if it works entirely, govs will cripple it and build their own versions.
@_date: 2018-11-27 01:57:41
I got it in 2012 and it has never happened or looked like it was making significant progress towards adoption beyond a period around 2013-15. Everyone is just price speculating.
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:53:32
I've been hearing that all year lol
@_date: 2018-11-25 23:09:50
I've made a lot of money out of it but it's still as unwieldy as it was five years ago and no closer to mass adoption. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:57:07
And yet it's been fairly stable in its purchasing power
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:56:01
Most day traders lose a lot of money
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:03:20
Who's adopting Bitcoin and why?
@_date: 2018-11-26 23:47:59
Because I've held BTC for 6 years and it's still *exactly* as useless and confused as it was then

No, people saw that coming for decades because it was obviously useful.
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:54:16
Yes but if you markedly improve upon Bitcoin you can eat into its market share, as it evidently happening

Also Bitcoin is quite possibly on its way out vs other currencies
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:01:10

@_date: 2018-02-05 13:11:38
No, I sold Bitcoin last year because I didn't see a future for it. LN is a hack that still isn't working after several years. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:49:53
Correct. Bitcoin deserves no more than 10% market share
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:31:19
Yeah I'm only up 4000% in 5 years now!
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:26:53
Doesn't need spamming
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:52:02
Yup. Bitcoin has network effect, brand recognition and 9 years of not being hacked. These things count but it's being seriously challenged in many areas at the moment. Monero is better for privacy, Nano for speed/cost and Ether/Neo/VeChain for use cases

Only in that it's spent a long time not being hacked. In terms of privacy Monero shits on it, speed/cost Nano shits on it, usage opportunities Ether/Neo/Vechain shit on it

but bitcoin is still almost entirely useless...

Friedman is a pillock
@_date: 2018-11-25 22:19:22
It's still a completely useless technology
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:49:17
Nano is already doing instant, feeless transactions. Sure, it might run into scaling problems, but as a pure medium of exchange it's already blowing Bitcoin out of the water
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:47:32


Or they've actually built off Bitcoin's tech and built in better solutions. But I suppose that one isn't worth considering...
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:54:27
I'm just saying that just because Bitcoin has been very resilient before doesn't mean it will always be
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:55:39
Isn't its volume already above Bitcoin's?

So greater decentralisation? I can certainly dig that. The issues with a world without tax as I foresee is that those who fall on hard times, whether as a consequence of their own actions or not, rely on fair-weather charity to survive. As clumsy as taxation is, I just can't see a way to avoid it and not have a society even more wildly unequal than the one we have today.
I'm glad cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin exist though and think there is a large niche for them - post Snowden my trust for Western governments is incredibly low.

I'm a socialist who owns Bitcoin...it doesn't really work
@_date: 2016-10-19 23:25:34
Societies are two way contracts. You use the apparatus of the state - roads, education, police and military protection - and you have to pay to keep these things functional. There are countries that don't want nearly as much tax and I suppose anyone is free to move to one of them. Bahrain? Cambodia? Kuwait?

The whole of Europe/the civilised world is at turns in hysterics at/appalled by American gun culture. It's mental.

Why the fuck is Ross Ulbricht on the front page as some kind of martyr? He's a would-be murderer to my mind.

Honestly, as a socialist who owns Bitcoin, I agree with her. I'd never want it to replace sovereign currencies, personally.
@_date: 2017-07-16 10:57:02
But they want to be digital-age John Galts!

One shouldn't be so stubborn as to stick rigidly to their principles to the extent that it ruins what they were trying to protect.
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:49:14
I'd like to know this too...
@_date: 2017-07-19 23:47:07
what about people who can see in 20/20 vision
@_date: 2017-07-18 00:26:08
Literally an hour after I decided to sell up and buy at a low :')
@_date: 2017-07-15 12:01:04
What a load of shit, Bitcoin's used for all kinds of heinous crimes.
@_date: 2017-07-16 10:55:15
@_date: 2017-07-18 00:27:28
I sold immediately before it started recovering, fml
@_date: 2017-07-16 11:01:05


@_date: 2017-07-16 11:16:39
Selling at £1500 is still selling high for this fella who bought in at £80 a piece. I'll buy in again later, I think it still has a way to fall.
@_date: 2017-07-16 10:58:38
Once Bitcoin's reputation's ruined it won't matter when it is
@_date: 2017-07-16 11:00:33
Absolutely agree. They all see themselves as virtuous John Galts of the online sphere, but they haven't realised the obvious appalling flaws in pure libertarianism that would utterly cripple society if it were the ascendant ideology.

Burn it all down, sick :)
