There's a gamut of difference in what Google tracks and what Facebook/Twitter/Instagram track. For you maybe it doesn't matter much but I find myself at much peace using duckduckgo a lot of times honestly. Well maybe you're right, you cannot avoid actually a lot of things even if you avoid Google's search. They have their presence everywhere. Google photos, cloud, YouTube etc etc. But shit doesn't seem scary right now. It could be after years from now, maybe after your death? You have no track record of your grandparents do you? Well wait until Google sells your history to your Grandchildren.

I'm not targeting you really, I know you meant the crypto markets. But that's exactly how it should be taken and talked about - the market. Just get annoyed sometimes because i see a lot of guys these days being smart-asses thinking they know everything in the "crypto" world now just because they've invested some money in it and try to explain blockchains and LN to every person in the room even though most of the times they're wrong. Just try going to the parties and you'll realise what i'm talking about. Anyway, i'm way too unnecessarily triggered with all the crypto geniuses these days using that term a lot. But its fine. I know what you meant :)

"to the world of crypto". Not trying to be cocky but it feels like every other person nowadays behaves like he/she really knows a lot about "crypto". I bet no one even knew what the term actually meant a few years before bitcoin. Everyone tries to show they're really profound in the area. The parties are even much more annoying these days.

You mean a $.1 for a kilowatt-hour? (I assume you are not charged for the power but the energy)
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:27:37
Lol man i hope you're right

I find Ripple the most promising as well - read everything about it, but it won't rise as high as bitcoin. There can be just too many of those 100b. Bitcoin will be 21m max. Would be surprised if xrp reaches $10. But again that's another reason why it seems to be a more plausible currency

It's a meme/misspelling for HOLD that started from here by a rambling drunkard:

To prevent you from swiping left to right unconsciously. 
EDIT: just don't use it for small transactions right now

Well sharing my experience, after completing a deal with the seller i.e receiving the bitcoins, i asked informally if the prices are negotiable. The guy said yes and i thought i missed the chance. Also happened the other time when i said if the prices are negotiable and the guy called and said that he can help if i want to buy these in lower prices. He'll remove the current ad and add another one then later lock it if my case for negotiation is convincing. So yeeah, i guess you should try sometimes!?

Won't go that far. Wonder how many bitcoins would a lemonade code then

Cryptocurrency is the future but NOT NECESSARILY Bitcoin. Not until LN. There are better alts.

Stop buying high and selling low. Try to be early.

It's Bajirao Mastani. Not Padmaavat. Both are similar and good movies though. Wonderfully shot historical epics

Don't go with percentages. I used to be 200% ones. It will never be 20% again.

It's a song from an Indian historical epic "Bajirao Mastani". The whole movie has great cinematography like this. Pretty good movie. This actor has some great stuff. Watch the movie "Gully Boy" as well or the trailer. You won't be disappointed.

The trailer for "Gully Boy" has. Otherwise it's just a foreign language film. You'll get the subtitles online. It's on Netflix/Amazon prime as well.

But what is the "Amazon of Japan"?

That's a revelry after some kind of victory. It's Hindi (a language in India) and the song ofc is from Bollywood. Name of the song is Malhari. Anyway, that made a hell of a meme!

Here's my observation: Before this spam post, the last guy's last activity was 4 years ago. What did I miss? 
@_date: 2018-02-17 03:09:41
Well I think there is some veracity to what he's saying and the account is fine :). There is a comment in the Lawschool sub that he made 4 years ago. Plus the guy has deleted what seemed to be like the spam posts. Anyway, I don't really see other reddit accounts. Enough with the sherlocking. Moving on to the video. The puppy is cute!

work? "exponential equivalent"? I don't want to sound like a dick but you're making y = mx + c and y = e^(x) sound like a research paper. Doesn't work that way in risk market

You know you're going to get downvoted so you created a new account for this one :p. Nice Sherlock.
