Not trying to be an ass here, but if an exchange lost, say, 5%, 10% of customers funds, it might be well over the amount they are able to cover.
5% of Bitfinex's holdings is a huge number.

It's not the user because without the platform nobody can move money.

You can pay a bitcoin expert once, say, $1000 to setup an easy and reliable system for you.
Or you can pay thousands per month to lawyers, accountants and banks.
Obviously the expert could fuck you by making you use a single signature address and keeping a copy. But technically, banks could also fuck you.

I didn't mean the password database was leaked, only the e-mails. Why I posted this is because only 2 other bitcoin related companies (one trading intelligence, one a small local bitcoin exchange) know that address is related to bitcoin.
The reason I posted this is to see if your company, being the biggest, was the source. Since we didn't have anyone else here relaying the same experience, it's doubtful.
I'm sorry for the accusation, I wanted to be sure this wasn't the case.

Your bitcoins would be in both, in such scenario, as long as you don't spend before said fork, until it has stabilized.
The danger is not in spending, but in accepting bitcoins. If you pay something, the seller is taking the risk of his coins being erased in case a rollback is necessary. You wouldn't be facing any risk. 
@_date: 2016-01-08 16:16:26

@_date: 2016-01-27 00:18:34
It removes the signatures from the blocks, thus shrinking transaction size to 25% of what it is now.
So, with 1 MB blocks you could fit 4 times as many transactions.
Plus, all the other benefits seg witnesses give to the protocol.

If you accept terms and conditions without reading them, you can't complain once they enforce them.
Your deposit is tied to accepting those conditions. Nobody forces anyone to send money.
If you get 20 grand wired into your checking account, your bank is legally obligated to ask you what's the origins of the funds.
You can't go and tell them "I don't want to give you that information, reverse the transfer".
Exact same laws here and the sub is throwing a fit based on naive libertarian idealism.
The law's the law, if you don't like it, you can work to change it. Or go against it and accept the consequences.

Regarding your wallet being on your SD card or not, even if it was, you are risking 2500 on you not losing your phone, having it stolen or having a technical issue.
That's not bitcoin fault.
Mycelium explains pretty clearly what the seed is for. If you read that (or not) and then lose the money because you don't have the seed used to derive your keys, that's on you, not bitcoin.
I agree Bitcoin-Qt is NOT friendly, and it's not meant to be.
But Mycelium is!
What you are asking from bitcoin is what? Hold your money for you, so if you don't backup as clearly advised, you can get your money back? Seriously???
I mean, you don't buy a chainsaw and start swinging wildly at trees without taking the time to know what need to do to operate it safely, do you?
You expected the wallet to be backup up to the cloud automatically. This criteria could have made you lose documents, photos.
Sorry for bashing, and I agree using bitcoin IS harder than a credit card. And instructional manuals should be clearer.
But shifting blame to the protocol when a simple step that is HIGHLIGHTED when you create your wallet, and takes 1 minute would have kept your money secure.
You decided not to do it because in your mind having someone access your paper was a more likely scenario than losing your phone. Well, you decided, face the consequences.

No, what I'm saying is that a bank's anti fraud system is built to protect the user against the fraudsters who might have copied his credit card. Also, regulations and insurance, but they are on your side.
In the code of a bitcoin selling agent, they need to protect against fraudsters that might use stolen bank accounts to buy bitcoins. And since bitcoin is non reversible, it's a pretty big risk for them. Hence, the adversarial relationship can never be eliminated between the companies and their customers.

Not trying to be an asshole, but I work at IT security and if you don't enforce the use of proper channels, you didn't do your job well.
You can have the best standards in the world but if a user who doesn't know better (nor needs to know because it's not his or her specialty) is able to fuck up your plan, the mistake is yours, not theirs.
Why allow users to use different channel settings than the ones determined best for the region? Limit the options, at least, hide them in an "advanced" menu and warn properly.

Sorry, I deleted my comment because I was stating a fact without knowing anything.
I recall now, I've heard an interview I think one of you guys gave at a podcast and there is isolation, being on a different chip.
So I'd trust this as much as I'd trust a hardware wallet. That means I'd trust a decent amount of money, but if I had (which I don't) $300.000, it's cold wallet. 
@_date: 2015-07-11 01:08:52
Sure, why not! 
@_date: 2015-08-27 14:07:27
Exactly, maybe that was their plan all along, the mythical long-con.
@_date: 2015-07-13 15:42:07
Then there's something weird. Blockchain.info, right?
They see your transaction.
Try login in from another computer or a mobile device. If that's not possible, try with another browser.
They use a pretty thick webapp and might be a local cache issue. If that doesn't help, contact their support.
But first triple check that you actually own that address on your blockchain account, just in case.
@_date: 2015-07-14 04:45:43

Emmm, that is a confirmed transaction, like the other posted asked, is that the correct address? 14VwemxsuV55iGXpoE5FSs4xPQS1B5jFNJ?

What more than a confirmation tells you is how exponentially harder it is for a miner with a large percentage of control over the network to go back a few confirmations and successfully mine divergent blocks that could double spend.
