**Secure Asset Transfer &amp; Settlement - Digital Bartering**
Bitcoin allows people to settle debts across the room or across the world, instantly. It simultaneously acts as a unit of account &amp; also a unit of value store. And anyone can do this instant settlement without a centralized third party (like venmo, or your bank account, or credit card)

This is actually not incompetence; instead we are witnessing malice. 
if you feel it's incompetence: please explain their decision to first roll out BCH trading (but not BCHvsBTC pair) instead of working on simple batching of transactions? 
Batching just their own tx will eliminate the majority of the mempool issues.  They CHOOSE to delay this to attempt to further the narrative that "bitcoin is broken" but, in fact, it is their behavior which is broken.
Furthermore, they do not even give their customers an option of what fee to use. It is auto-set by coinbase absurdly high, and the customer pays for it. Crucially, coinbase does not bear any of this fee burden. That point is very important to let sink in...
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:58:37
Hi OP - we all pay for mining fees *in bitcoin* - not in terms of USD. Very, very, very important point.
Anyone telling you to base your mining fee off a specific dollar value does not fully understand the fundamentals of how the mining fee system works.
Each bitcoin transaction costs a certain amount of bitcoin per filesize of the transaction itself (more bytes = more bitcoin needed) this is completely irrespective of the absolute value of BTC being transferred.
Using that website (which is awesome, and johoe is similarly awesome for providing it for free) you want to look at the bottom most graph. You can then rather accurately figure which transactions will be chosen for "the next block" based on the amount of satoshis they pay per byte. Note that you cannot ever predict precisely *when* that next block will occur, or how many new transactions will spawn into existence after you broadcast your transaction...
But, it is always around 1MB worth off the top of that sorted pile of the bottom graph.  There is a considerable amount of "garbage" transactions with 0 or 1 or even 2 satoshi per byte. 
Example, if you pay even just 3 satoshi per byte - all those 0, 1, and 2 fee-size transactions are effectively eliminated from your perspective. The site allows for clicking on the legend to hide those levels from view making the chart more readable.
Fees in terms of USD will **obviously** increase as the USD value of the bitcoin asset itself rapidly appreciates (as more and more rich people realize it's something they want, but can't have)
Fees in terms of BTC &amp; the mining system itself are more-or-less completely unchanged for many months/years - the value of the BTC is what changed. Don't let people tell you otherwise...
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:05:55
OP, what you should really be asking is: "How many High Net Worth Individuals are there?" (these are people worth $1M and up)
And the [answer is on Wikipedia]( (about 13-15 million humans worldwide)
The reason you want to ask this question, is if Bitcoin is seen as a "normal" asset in a well balanced investment portfolio, *and* these rich people wish to obtain 1 full Bitcoin, which would *(currently)* be a tiny fraction of their aggregate wealth........ they simply can not do this. There are just not enough Bitcoin to go around.....
Then answer yourself: "When was the last time a super-rich person only wanted 'part' of something?" And realize that the law of supply and demand will dictate the value of this asset should be rising exponentially as it becomes a toy of the rich and powerful.
If you happen to have 1 single BTC of your own, and a job that pays your bills..... do **everything** in your power to hold at least that 1 BTC and don't sell or trade it for *anything*..... in a few years time it will either be completely worthless or absolutely priceless.......
Don't worry if you don't have 1 full coin- luckily BTC breaks down 8 decimals to the satoshi, so you can still buy and sell $50 worth even in this scenario of rapid value appreciation.
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:51:42
The filesize of a bitcoin transaction is determined by the length/number of hex characters making up the raw transaction that is actually broadcast and included in a block. Each pair of characters that makes up a hex value is 1 byte. So if the string of characters is 450 in length, it has a byte size of 225 (this is the most typical 1 input 2 output transaction)
What you are not fully understanding is that a single address can have multiple "chunks" of bitcoin that were sent to it. And each one of those chunks needs to be fully spent in an outgoing transaction. This is primarily why change addresses even exist in the first place.
So, it's hard to say without knowing how you received your bitcoins in your address(es) and how you are constructing your recipients to figure what your ultimate mining fee will be.
Each address is actually a pair of strings, one public and one private. Your wallet is a collection of these keypairs.
Your "seed" is most likely the random bits of entropy that create all the keys in your wallet (assuming this is an HD wallet)
Ultimately miners choose which transactions to include in their prospective new block based on the most fee per byte paid (because longer byte size tx costs them more processing power/time.... and nothing in life is free; more power it costs them, more satoshi it costs you) --- So it's not correct to think that a "large fee" is correct or not simply in absolute BTC terms. You want the tx fee appropriate to the mempool peers based on the standardized "satoshi per byte" metric.
Your wallet app should be able to tell you all of this if it is properly written.

Hi there!
Bitcoin ATMs are a great way to turn paper currency into bitcoin quickly, safely, &amp; securely!
When buying bitcoins from an ATM, please keep in mind there are different exchange rates for each ATM. The machine should tell you what it will be charging you *before* you put any cash into it. Almost always this rate will be different than the rates that your wallet app or an online exchange uses.
We recommend people to use their own wallet on their own phone, like breadwallet or mycelium, when accessing the bitcoin ATM and **not** a web based wallet, like blockchain.info or coinbase. Once the coins are sent, it's simple &amp; secure for the user to then send where they wish.
We have a number of locations in NY/NJ - so if you're in the tri-state area, give us a shout! Map of all our locations &amp; hours on our website: 
Also we have a brief tutorial on bitcoin, paper wallets, &amp; wallet apps, too:

For any onlookers wondering..... the volume numbers on local are deceiving. Yes the raw number is very high, however it belies the fact a good portion of those coins are resold on LBC. 
The same bitcoin can be bought and sold many times without ever leaving the website and this all increases that volume number, since the trades are public and aggregate on the API.
@_date: 2015-12-08 14:09:46
Respectfully, I am not talking about robotic arbitrage on exchange, my point is very true for LBC. I am talking about a trader obtaining a large clutch of coins from another, and then reselling those coins to other people for various payment methods. Which also get resold back and forth. All on local's website.
Source: I am the one and only coin_trader on local. I know quite well how the ecosystem works, and can safely say that jeremias and his brother at local are far and away the best bitcoin company on the planet in terms of security and profit. Historically and still currently. They run a proper ship.
@_date: 2015-06-07 14:16:13


Eh...Pretty much....
There are two words to describe why weekends are consistently lower volume than weekdays:
***Cash Deposits.***
The volume on LBC is almost entirely based around the banking hours in USA.
After that, there's a decent smattering of other payment types but the vast amount of volume **in escrow** goes through cash deposits. 
Remember, the only trades you see on the LBC charts are those that are handled through the escrow system &amp; do NOT go into dispute. If you meet in person and send direct, no records of the trade exist in the charts. If you trade and put it in dispute for admin resolution, the record does not make it into charts either.
However, the charts do include "fake" volume from people trading with their own shill accounts to boost stats. I've seen some rather odd trades in the raw data. Think they would've sorted that all out by now..... *Regardless, there's plenty more real volume than fake volume on LBC.*

Hi Max,
With all due respect, PayPal is not risky at all for the buyer of bitcoins. We speak from vast experience here. For the *seller*, however, it's effectively an "honor system" and there is indeed heavy risk -- of which, there is **no recourse**. But, when you are the buyer of coins with PayPal, you'll have no worries once your account is properly set up. 
That being said, it IS incredibly convenient, since you can do it all from your couch. And when people find a reliable and consistent trader, they generally stick with them. You're more than welcome to examine our LBC account trade history and see exactly what is meant regarding our PayPal experience...
Once we even purchased coins directly from one of your bosses via PayPal :)

You are making quite a few assumptions, OP.


There's the first problem. Past performance is no indication of the future. VERY important to understand that things can change at any time.
Second problem is that you're casting very negative light on the future based on paranoia of what you have read/heard on the internet. Please do not equate a VC-backed exchange with Gox. That's really unfair to compare the hodgepodge amalgamation that was the result of someone who arguably has Aspbergers &amp; his head in the clouds vs something that needs to be bank-grade compliant and has hundreds of millions of venture capital backing &amp; regulatory oversight.
Third assumption is that you feel you cannot "sell enough" via OTC when the price "is still close to the top". Couple points: Yes, you can sell enough. People are always buying and selling. Even at the top and even at the bottom for the past 2+ years we've been in the space. 
But in the end, the major problem is that **no one can predict the top**

They're trying to push their wallet service. Yes, you need your ID verified to receive. Yes you can reverse payments (error, fraud, etc)
Like was said in another comment, you can already use bitcoin with email (or SMS, or IRC, or anything with text - even snail mail). 
You definitely dont want your private keys stored on an email server, by the way.
With all due respect, bitcoin already "works" with email as-is.

Seriously though, if you're giving your bank account information to random strangers on the internet and expecting to sell bitcoins with no blowback in return.... you're asking for what is effectively bacon wrapped unicorn farts.
No middle man company (which is all that bitquick does) will reimburse you when the bank decides to black list your SSN and prevent you from opening accounts or doing business with them in the future. 
There is not much (beside the law obviously) stopping some bad actor from doing one small trade to receive the account information, and then drawing up fake checks/making fraud ACH pulls off your newfound info - all sorts of nasty things you want **NO** part of. When your account suffers such hardships it puts you at an higher level of risk for the bank. They have to eat the costs on the fraud and make good on anything those bad actors did. This more than likely will cause them to "rethink their business relationship with you" because you are now costing the bank money. 
**TL;DR - don't give out your bank info. Unless you know and trust the person you're giving it to.**

Absolutely not. As pointed out, different payment methods are worth different rates. 
In other words, there is a different "price" for a dollar as physical cash in hand vs a wire transfer dollar vs a gift card dollar vs a cash-deposited-in-your-bank-account dollar, etc. People make their own spreads based on the risk they are willing to accept for different methods of payment, and the site keeps the escrow centralized to do their best and enforce honest trading.

The data on the charts is pretty lackluster and not very clear. 
**Pedant Rant:**
First off, this is only trades that complete inside of escrow. Second, it's not explained that the bars on each chart are the # of bitcoins traded weekly totals, and **not** the amount of fiat currency volume during the period. Because bitcoin is historically much more volatile than fiat, trading 50 BTC on LBC today is a much different "amount of wealth" than a short while ago. Whereas trading $50 on LBC, whether it's today last month or last year, is basically the same "amount of wealth" and is a much more accurate metric to judge use &amp; adoption. Whoever made the page should regenerate the charts with the "volume in currency" button checked for a more accurate analysis.
It is also worth noting the absolute sheer volume difference between USD and all the rest of the currencies. USD is vast majority, when it looks rather "even" since the charts scale equally for themselves. Example: USD has traded easily well over 12k BTC every week since beginning of year, while most other currencies have trouble trading more than one hundred coins per week. Big. Big. Difference.
*The only thing the charts do show clearly is that LBC is slowly starting to become more and more adopted for trading BTC in local currencies around the world.*
And I must add: I do love the tagline at the bottom of the page: "The revolution will not be centralized." - clever

PayPal is only as safe as the person you're trading with.
This is a good rule of thumb for ALL trades. As another post said, definitely look at feedback first. The traders with thousands of feedbacks are what you should look for. Hundreds of feedbacks or less are just "meh" when it comes to PayPal trades
We purchase bitcoin via PayPal all the time. Been doing this for years. Never a problem when we are the buyers. We have people who specifically will only trade with us because they know we are here for the long haul and not out for a quick buck. Consistency, reliability, &amp; honesty helps.

Hello mate,
Congrats on your find! Wonderful to hear of a story where the old wallet that held bunch of coins gets found after being lost for so long! 
To answer your questions: Yes Kraken is very legit. I have personally met Jesse (the CEO) when he came to my office with some other big names in the bitcoin world. And I know Austin from when he was in the NYC bitcoin scene.   They are now HQ'd in San Fran last I heard
Definitely consult an accountant who specializes in virtual currency and/or your lawyer (and make sure he/she/they know and are up to date on all the gov't guidelines for your local jurisdiction) every country has their own tax nuances.
Oh and also, **very important**, triple check to make sure you're not putting that wallet on a computer that is pre-infected with malware..... preferably do it on a new computer.... 3700 BTC is currently well worth the excuse to buy a new laptop just for this purpose

Well, currently, most merchants need to purchase their stock via conventional fiat means, usually direct bank wire and ACH-style transfers. There's no major signs of that changing, so the only reason for a merchant to keep their sale profits (net or gross) in bitcoin is for speculation. Generally speaking, businesses that wish to survive do not heavily speculate with their earnings. 
**TL;DR:** This software does not send fiat to your bank, which is usually what merchants want (need) to continue to stay in business.

The vast majority of customer support issues we deal with arise entirely from the use of "bad" or "crappy" wallet app software. I say that in quotes, because, in a pinch, you can get away with it and be OK.... but fundamentally, you are trusting someone else (the wallet server) to hold your coins safe. Furthermore, you are beholden to that server's internet connection in addition to your own merely to access them or even just to look at them. 
So, if you use website, like blockchain.info - and blockchain.info is down (frequent occurrence historically) then you can do nothing with your coins.
If you are using your own wallet app on your own phone, then you do not need to trust another service to access the bitcoin, since the keys all live on the phone. The phone broadcasts to the network itself. The phone is in your pocket where no one else can grab it and steal your keys. It is also most likely way more secure than your PC/laptop, especially if it is NOT jailbroken.
**TL;DR** - the good wallet apps I mentioned are safer more secure than any web based wallet. It is for a more pleasant user experience to use a proper wallet.

@_date: 2015-05-20 23:21:24
Have always thought the best way to buy lots of bitcoins for cheap is to first manipulate the exchanges by selling BTC to tank the price... Then lock up large OTC deals for many more coins when the price is low. Ideally, you would want to sell enough on exchanges to cause a mini panic with weaker hands further depressing the price- so you can buy more coins direct OTC.
With how thin the liquidity is in the orderbooks on all of the exchanges, it means you can usually move the price with relatively little money. This effect has gotten much "less" in recent months, however it sure still appears viable.
Once the OTC deals have been solidified and you have net more coins than you started with, you can use the fiat on exchanges (that you acquired from the initial dump) to bring the price back up, and, if you really wanted to be a dick, repeat the process again and again.....
Example: Keep in mind this changes by the second, so at different points in the day will be more/less beneficial to do......... but if you went to sell 10k coins on finex (at the moment this is being typed), it would bring the price down to around 200 - and will credit your exchange balance a little more than 2 mil USD in value. Let's simplify the armchair math by forgetting about the other exchanges and assuming these numbers are for **all** exchanges at the moment. This means, if you can buy back more than 10k coins via OTC methods @ ~200 per coin, you have now made some $$$$ and can now use the 2mil fiat on exchange to pop the price back to where it was, as soon as the order book is thin enough for it to make financial sense to pump.
Is it a gamble? yes... But depending on OTC contacts &amp; the time of day this maneuver is executed, it's less risky than may appear at first blush.

You wanna sacrifice security for usability go ahead, that's your call. Furthermore, Armory is *not* crap for usability. That's your opinion.

Conversely, Ledger Wallet is a product you need to purchase and has not been really reviewed open source code. There are a handful of 3rd party implementations to interact with the hardware and are basically unused on github. The hardware itself is not open source.

This ponzi was unrelated to bitcoin *(shocking, I know)* until just recently when the ponzi operators decided to start taking BTC instead of fiat for payments into the scheme. IMHO, this is causing the massive price discrepancy over there.
We're not about to give them any extra publicity so don't ask for a name or a link. Fuck ponzis... google it yourself if you are so inclined.

Nope, nothing is wrong. Bitcoins are Bitcoins and Dollars are Dollars. 
As others have pointed out, you are assuming all apps and exchanges reference the same rate (they dont) and you are also incorrectly assuming that the price of bitcoin-in-dollars will remain constant during the time it takes the bitcoins to move from one address you own (your mycelium) to the other (your changetip). 
Both of these misconceptions will lead you to arrive at the errant conclusion of "not having enough money!" when the coins finally show up in changetip.
I will wager if you check your balance (in dollars) in a few hours it will say something different even without moving your bitcoins at all! This is the nature of how exchange rates work. You will have the same amount of bitcoins, but they will be worth either more or less than the 10 dollars you started with depending on how the markets have behaved.
Welcome to bitcoin :)

Hello there OP,
Sorry to hear about your troubles with them. It's never a fun time dealing with problems that you didn't create. We wish you the best, but it's doubtful any legal channels (like lawsuits) will help you with this price mishap from their system... My suggestion is to simply make people aware of your situation and move on with the knowledge to protect yourself from this in the future. They are Boost VC funded, so perhaps with enough negative PR someone will investigate and reimburse you for your loss... That's about your best angle from where we sit.
Professional curiosity: What made you choose to sell coins on the BitQuick platform as opposed to LBC, which has a *vastly* larger userbase &amp; less fees?
We happen to be well established traders both on LBC and locally here in NYC. If you wish to trade with a competent counter-party, feel free to contact us anytime!

This is how it currently works, how it would behave with 2MB blocks, and also how it would (eventually) work with even 8MB or 32MB blocks.  FYI: current fee to guarantee including a transaction within a block or two is about 19 cents per transaction in USD equivalent. It has been like this for little over a day with the "stress test" going on right now. Yesterday it topped out around 32 cents per tx for "prime fee" --- My node has sent few hundred transactions in this time period, none of them got delayed with the fee levels stated above. For my use case, these levels are acceptable. For others, this is not the case...
Simply by having an upper limit on the blocksize ensures that there will in fact be a fee market at some point in the future (if not already now)
Unless there is zero block size limit, and at any given time a miner can cement ALL mempool transactions, I don't see an end to FUD and fee market BS. And that is unlikely due to logistics of shuttling bytes around to propagate all that data between the nodes.
*Unfortunately, for those who wish to have bitcoin be used for micro-payment transactions of a few cents themselves, this model is not economically feasible. I feel this is what is causing the majority of the strife online.*
@_date: 2016-03-09 23:09:14
The short answer is no.
The long answer is that "bitcoin" is "bitcoin" only because all of the bitcoin software in the world is using rules that are **the same** -- and if you want a different parameter in the rules, then you now have **a different thing:** like litecoin, or dogecoin, or ethereum... So can it be like gold and silver? meh.. guess so? But, what's the point. Just use a different crypto if you want different parameters.... 
@_date: 2016-03-16 21:39:39
well.... considering the whole block size debate really heated up around the exact same time as the xt/classic/unlimited advertising pushes... it seems very coincidental here...
Definite answer? no... but very probable to make strong educated guess for sure...

With respect, don't think Coinbase will last for you very long, given the "high risk" nature of your profession. They are not in the business of dealing with any "high risk" businesses. But fear not, there is more than one way to get you happily accepting bitcoin &amp; using!
There are other better wallet solutions for you, all on mobile, where you retain full control of the money (private keys) and not a corporation who may decide to freeze your funds for reasons you may never know.
Check out Rack Wallet, breadwallet, or Airbitz - all of those will give you complete control. Get them on the official iOS and google play stores.
**By the way**.... Here's a little tip for you *and anyone else*... if you're ever near NYC, come visit one of our ATMs in the vape shops in manhattan &amp; cash out your bitcoins at 4% over market!
My company is the world's largest Bitcoin ATM network.  - Some of our 2-way machines will cash out bitcoins **above** market, so you make extra $ on your hard earned bitcoins!

Hello OP! 
If your coins are legally obtained, and you wish to get that turned into cash, then we are happy to do this for you. We are even ok to give it to you as bricks of physical paper cash!
But first you would need to talk to our compliance officer and explain exactly how you first got the coins, and what "various activities" you did to increase their number. You mention that you don't have much information, but clearly, since you did this yourself, you must surely have SOMETHING else to say about it to discuss the coins origins and how they came into your belonging.  **If you satisfy the compliance requests**, then there is **no limit** to how many coins we will buy!! And we will pay you spot price at the time of transfer(s), too!
As far as paying taxes on this sale - yes, always pay your taxes!!! That is how teachers and firemen get paid, and how roads &amp; bridges are maintained... Ya know.. Things necessary for a well functioning 1st world society....
Regarding the 40% tax amount..... You should definitely consult a proper tax accountant on this, you're talking over 200k USD worth of coins held for (I assume) awhile. I am not a tax guru (instead, we hire them) but I know that there are different tax levels for assets held &gt; 1 year vs shorter term capital sales... You **may** be closer to 15-20% tax level on some of the coins depending on your activity. Definitely consult a professional on this. I cannot accurately advise you on it.

Hi there OP,
For historical lookups, there exists 2 API services I know of:  (scroll down for the historical docs) 
quandl, which has many various aggregations such as: 
however neither will give you the granularity you are asking for.
I don't believe there exists any historical data beyond ~month old that can be anything finer than daily pricing.
I personally have written scripts that run 24/7 and record every trade on finex, btce, stamp, &amp; local bitcoins USD trades. I can build my own candlestick charts on-call for whatever time periods I wish since the scripts began running. But that's specific to me and me alone.
Wish there was a service that provided this data, so I didn't have to build &amp; maintain it myself...... *hint hint*

Hey, so this title is horse-shit. Reading the actual summary of what the TAC [the tech committee] will be discussing, here's a direct quote for the relevant part of bitcoin: 


Meaning, the CFTC wants to use blockchain ledger-like technology for derivatives markets, because what they have now is basically shit. This is not news and has been talked about previously. Personally, it's about damn time the legacy markets get closer to instant settlement! 
**TL;DR:** There is no f*ing way any govt can 'regulate bitcoin'. Governments can (and should) continue to regulate their own fiat currencies. They simply cannot regulate mathematics and data transfer protocol, which is effectively: bitcoin.

**Was his intention to kick off the chain and mint the first block exactly on Jan 1?** fresh year, all nice and new, perhaps unix-epoch timestamp would have become bitcoin-epoch? ...or did something unfortunately stupid delay him and the world didn't see bitcoin for another 2 days thus mucking up the would-be-perfect new year start? 
Like maybe the power blew and he had to reset lol

We have alluded to something like this before in a previous post...
We're all fans of graphs &amp; data viz.... so, please go to:   or  and notice how the level of core nodes is relatively steady while the number of classic nodes has skyrocketed. 
*Now let's think about that.*
This logically would imply a whole heap of new users to the bitcoin ecosystem. However, we know damn well that is not the case, as there is no rampant fervor or mania on the spot or OTC markets of people looking to purchase coins for the new nodes. It's basically same ole' volume.
More likely this is all part of the ongoing block size debate. Which in our humble opinion, is incredibly childish &amp; political. Best of luck to both parties. We here really couldn't care less about the ongoing games.

Right. The US govt seized US Dollars that they themselves created. 
Since when did $2.1m USD magically become bitcoins? Sounds more like to me they seized their own fiat currency from a bank that they themselves issued bank licenses to....

Hi there, neighbor- welcome to the city! That’s one of our many locations here in NY- we are glad to be of service to you! We’ve got 91 terminals currently in NYC, Long Island, and NJ for your trading convenience
If you or anyone else has questions or comments - you may call or text that phone number on the kiosk screen and one of our live human representatives will be happy to help you out! ...Y hablamos español!
We also offer some of the most aggressive &amp; favorable margins for large cash trading too (after account approval, of course- which takes at most 1 biz day) with rates as low as only 6% for trades $5000 and up
..And the opposite direction, when you cash out bitcoins, is just flat 5% at the time of transaction regardless of cash size. 
That particular location is 24/7 as well! All of our bitcoins are broadcast every 15min, so you are guaranteed rock solid service- like clockwork!

With respect- and apologies in advance for being pedantic, but legacy ATMs and term “ATM” speaks of allowing people to access their own money which is held on their behalf by a financial institution, custodially in their own bank accounts.. our machines do no such thing. At all our locations the user is directly trading with us, the company. They are trading paper USD and receiving real actual bitcoin (not an IOU, not a custodial token) sent directly to their scanned or printed wallet address like clockwork.
Our machines are much closer to a currency exchange or gold/silver dealers than a traditional bank card processing system. We are also not custodial over their money (no pre-funding or funds advance required- just cold hard cash)
Granted i believe you are speaking about online electronic exchange trading, like with Gemini or coinbase - and this is indeed not that. However, is is not mincing words to say we trade between paper USD and bitcoin. 
Many people, actually, do not have bank accounts to trade electronically with - for variety of reasons - and are therefore excluded from the bitcoin ecosystem aside from our kiosk portals. 
Furthermore, it would appear you are referring mostly to people cashing out their bitcoin for paper USD, which this particular machine does handle also. However it is worth noting that even though our margin for cash-out trades is by far the lowest around (at 5%) the VAST majority of our business is people putting cash into the machine to acquire bitcoin. Not the other way around... 
In other words: real people want real bitcoin using real paper money. Once they have the bitcoin, they generally don’t wish to cash out that much... they hold it or buy things with it or send it to friends / family. 
And likewise, we still do consider it “trading”, as there is no user’s right to the money until the trade is consummated by the user sending the correct amount of bitcoin to the unique deposit address - only at which point the cash is earmarked and reserved for them to grab. 
That all being said, we have been operating for many years- through all “price swings” and can unequivocally say that (some of the) people who have bought bitcoin from us years ago sold it back to us and made a very good profit on the trades- and we fully encourage and support that personal investment behavior activity! Good on them!!! It’s about time wealth gets spread around
A rising tide will lift all ships, and bitcoin helps grant financial freedom and wealth to those that may not have ever had it before. It is quite certainly an amazing phenomenon - we are honored to be in the position we are to help the people we help 
Lastly, we appreciate and welcome your comments and dialog - especially when you can present a logical differing opinion, or suggest new terminology to have everyone on the same page

This tetra site and the OP are advising traders to flaunt US money transmission laws. This behavior is *incredibly risky.*
Guess what, OP? Canada is not The USA... By telling US Persons they will be "routing through your compliant channels" they will then have a false sense of security that they can avoid prosecution for running unlicensed money transmission businesses.
Crucially: They will still be prosecuted...
From the [FAQ](




Traders: It does not matter what service you use to try and "shield" or "umbrella" yourself under: if you are trading **US DOLLARS** in excess for **ANYTHING**, you need to **know the person** you are trading with, and cannot rely on some escrow service to do the verification and then give you a thumbs up or down, or remit the funds on your behalf. You need to actually **have** the information on the counterparty, which is called "due diligence".  It does not matter if you are trading Bitcoin, or Gold, Lawnmowers, or Chevy Trucks. Anything for **cold hard cash is what counts.**
Some states are stricter than others, too. Always known one's own jurisdictional rules/laws and not rely on what is "too good to be true".
Trade carefully, people. Lest you wind up behind bars.

Hello there! In order to trade bitcoins (or any digital asset) in NY state, one must be licensed by the Department of Financial Services. It's not a quick or easy process by any stretch of the imagination.

Most likely, yes, the entity engaging in the trade from a business perspective will be the party prosecuted..... however, crucially, the law makes **no distinction**, so you are risking whether or not the government decides if they wish to prosecute or not.... at their discretion.
You wanna take that chance? Cool. Roll the dice then................ but before you do, google for all the unlicensed bitcoin traders that have all gotten arrested in recent months.

What do you mean by "confirmed way" ?
If you have BTC.... and someone else has PayPal, and you trust them, and want to trade...... you trade. it's not rocket science....
If you're asking is there a way to make sure the individual you're trading with will NOT chargeback on your trade after the fact, that is impossible to determine. You need to trust your counter-party with PayPal transactions. No getting around that caveat.
We've had good success with buying bitcoins via PayPal since we have a very high reputation in the OTC trading world and it is known widely that we are quick &amp; do not ever chargeback. We do not, however, sell bitcoins for PayPal due to chargeback risk from others.
**TLDR**: There is nothing inherently wrong, illegal, or against PayPal terms for trading bitcoins. It's just not covered under the seller protection since it's digital goods, which is why you need to trust the other person.

Newsflash:  Bitcoin is not anonymous. Calm down, mate. No one is nabbing your kids for your bits. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:16:57
Yep, little bit of fail here. Let's go step by step:
You bought 0.13678774 BTC when the price of bitcoin was 685.65 right? that means you spent 0.13678774 * 685.65 = $93.7885139 for those bitcoins.
Using your other values, that gives you also 0.37809573 * 2010.12 = $760.017789 and 0.22542489 * 1469.89 = $331.349792 too
So, now we take all the bitcoin numbers and add them up. 0.13678774 + 0.37809573 + 0.22542489 = 0.74030836 BTC total
Let's also add up how much USD you spent total to get those 0.74030836 BTC... 93.7885139 + 760.017789 + 331.349792 = $1185.15609  
Ah ha! We now know that you spent a total of $1185.15609 for 0.74030836 BTC, meaning you paid an average price of 1185.15609 / 0.74030836 = $1600.89519
Just about $1600.90 is your answer.
@_date: 2015-08-06 18:42:35
Umm... wow. So, does this ATM software handle the AML compliance aspect of collecting the user's information before allowing them to trade? Because this video is shot around NYC, one would hope this software is compliant, otherwise no one can legally operate them in the state of NY.... 
And let's not even get into that it's accepting PayPal for bitcoin which is like..... wow. All can be said: "Good Luck!"

Uh, wut..? they let you create an account before verifying your residential address &amp; ID? ....**AND** they let you send them fiat money too? How did the app let you "buy" --&gt; via your bank account? That's crazy!
Aren't they supposed to be regulated and should've not let that happen in the first place?
Hmm... it seems a little weird, no?
FWIW: their wallet app is pretty poor technology, and will not respect a payment QR code properly, nor does it allow for the importing of private keys... May be a wise idea to check out a proper mobile wallet, regardless of how it turns out with your account.

Hi Kent. Here is the link to the law: 
As we had mentioned, if the trader is doing one time small trade for himself, **should** be fine, but there is big problems if the government decides that it is a “business activity” and the parties have no license between them... and it’s really up to their discretion.
Again. Both parties are taking the risk when trading as unlicensed entities.  And it is reckless to gloss over the state virtual currency law.
We also cannot assume how much OP is trading. Maybe it’s $20. Maybe it’s $20k.

Umm... using our machines is not suspicious and does not immediately result in anything being reported when the user follows directions and falls within our expected use cases.
Instructing people to avoid our machines, however, is definitely suspicious, and raises eyebrows. ~~Oh look, it was a comment from a throw-away account... figures.
@_date: 2015-08-02 14:40:07
Our Genesis machines already handle multiple cryptos... However, there is little to no demand for people buying alternate crypto via ATM that we have seen, and therefore we don't even use that capability of our existing machines.
....Everyone who buys crypto daily with cash, uses bitcoin.....
Also, as the other poster said, portable ATM is the worst idea - it **will** get stolen. There is a very good reason why all the normal ATMs you see around the world are bolted down into the ground.
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:58:42
Wow... um.... speaking as a regulated financial entity myself.... that behavior is, well, to put it nicely..... not correct....  This means they allowed you to trade anonymously on their regulated platform....? How precisely did you link the CC? Just entered the details like you would adding a card for your Amazon account or similar online webstore? 
And you are sure they **definitely** didn't ask you for ID when linking the card? This seems pretty gnarly for them.... If this is true I cannot even fathom how much credit card fraud they must presently be getting hit with.....
Anyone from coinbase care to comment? 
OP are you able to withdraw the bitcoin from the platform to a bitcoin address of your choosing?
@_date: 2015-08-29 18:57:41
Hi OP, 
LBC's warning is correct, as is another poster. Effectively, any bitcoin transaction taking place in, or involving a NYS resident/biz entity, requires just **one** of the parties to be licensed and fulfill their stated AML policy, or they would be in violation of this new law... 
You may or may not be aware: we have applied within the required timeframe and have a provisional license to trade bitcoins for cash legally with in and out of state residents and businesses alike!
We have 9 ATMs in the city &amp; boros right now, with a few more launching next week and the following week!
**Current NYC list:**
- Henley Vaporium @ 23 Cleveland Pl, New York, NY 10012
- Henley Vaporium @ 350 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10010
- Vape Supply Co @ 40 Bushwick Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11211
- Sonny's Groceries @ 767 10th Ave, New York, NY 10019
- Apollo Deli &amp; Fruit @ 2350 Frederick Douglass Blvd, New York, NY 10027
- B-Papa Mini Market @ 689 Ralph Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11212
- 89 Deli @ 164-03 89th Ave, Jamaica, NY 11432
- The Bagels Road @ 1424 Sheepshead Bay Road, Brooklyn, NY 11235
- P International Style Barbershop @ 104-106 East 167 Street, Bronx, NY 10452
The top 3 are full service 2-way ATMs capable of buying or selling coins. The rest are only for putting cash in and getting bitcoins out of the machine.

Hi Jesse.... our legal counsel has informed me on very similar topic earlier:  if your user actually has a bitlicense themselves.... Then you're all good, actually. 
Take us for example: We are an existing bitcoin business operating in NY. We dutifully have applied for this bit license, therefore, we are legally able to trade freely with in-and-out-of-state residents and businesses just like always.  Our doors are always open...
Only problem is the "businesses with bit license" isn't really your target demographic...
**TL;DR for bitcoin transactions involving one party in NY: both parties don't need bit license, just one does.**
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:35:01
.... my jaw = on the floor....
Can you withdraw the coins?
@_date: 2015-08-13 06:37:20
First of all - **Yes, we have applied for Bit License with NYDFS** and furthermore, if anyone engages in transacting bitcoins for cash as a business activity (**not** for the acceptance of goods/service) in or with NY residents/businesses, then they must apply for licensure too. We are a registered federal MSB which follows all applicable laws &amp; legally required guidelines.
Few things are completely *misrepresented* in lots of posts regarding this new law. LBC is making this *legally correct* decision to block NY State (and let's not forget Germany) from their website - perhaps the local jurisdictions were deemed not worth the overhead cost to comply. **It is not illegal to trade, just illegal when trading unlicensed**. 
However, since we have been an existing bitcoin business before the law existed **and** applied within the 45-day grace period, we get what is called a "provisional license" where we are allowed to continue trading freely with in-and-out of state residents while NYDFS reviews our application materials &amp; engages in back and forth dialog with our compliance officer &amp; legal counsel.
**TL;DR** We've mentioned this before on reddit, but it's worth repeating... as explained by our legal counsel: *For crypto (bitcoin) transactions involving one party in NY: both parties don't need bit license, just one does.*

According to how the law has been explained to me, there is a carveout for merchants who accept payment for goods &amp; service via bitcoin. A ticket for a comedy show, the downloadable content of that show, or any t-shirts, mugs, other merchandise, etc he wishes to sell all would squarely fit into the "goods and services" carveout for him to be except and **not** require a license. 
Don't worry, Louie's good to go.

Well, **if** (and is a big IF) the OP is directly purchasing goods/services with bitcoin, that is indeed part of the carveout for not needing a license. But, OP did not specify this... OP did not mention how much cash was involved, either, nor the method of payment. And that alone (if it's cash and crosses the CTR threshold) is a mandatory requirement...
All OP said was that he/she identified as a NY resident to the LBC trader, and this seller still sold bitcoins to the OP. Beyond a shadow of doubt the seller is in violation, regardless of where the seller lives/is; and, depending on the use case, **perhaps** the OP too, but maybe not..
Respectfully, you are projecting what you think OP has done instead of anticipating all possible scenarios.
What you consider "big time seller" may not be what another considers "big time seller". Most recent arrest of an LBC trader was with someone who is alleged to have traded "thousands" of dollars over a few years. Doesn't sound all that whale-like to me....  This is precisely why I said it's a gamble if you conduct business with unlicensed traders...

Better illustrations on this link that show the farce known as EDA with Bitcoin Cash.
There are spikes in hashpower when the EDA kicks in, and the miners flock to and then away from this chain as they dump their coins on the various exchanges to a bunch of bagholders who buy into the hype without realizing the technicals that underpin what a blockchain actually is...
Furthermore, node analysis has already been done on the BCH chain too. 
Conclusion at the end of the article:


Also: In just a few months it will be relatively trivial to re-write the BCH fork due to its consistent slow loss of hashing security, so get ready with some popcorn in early 2018 for the reorgs....

Hi there OP / redditor for 3 hours...
What you did was, most likely, not very kosher with respect to the NY rules and regulations regarding virtual currency.... But, if we can assume you did a small one-time trade, proactively learned about the relevant cash-trading laws, and you don't make a business out of trading virtual currency for cash prior to obtaining the required financial license... you may be ok.
As other posters have mentioned, you should **seriously** consider signing up with a regulated online exchange, like Gemini, to freely and legally trade at your leisure by linking your bank account online... or, if you prefer to trade in physical cash, and also live near NYC, you may *100% legally* use any of our company's kiosk network, which, happens to be the largest fully compliant bitcoin ATM network in NY. We have just under 50 terminals in and around NYC for our users to interact and trade with on a daily basis. So you can rest easy that there are already solutions to the problem!

LMFAO @ **"The local currency is transferred through a payment processor that supports non-reversible payments"**
hahhaaaaa wow. where's my popcorn.... 
*From OKPay's own ToS, because clearly none of you lot know how to read:*
Section 4. Description of Services
4.1. OKPAY' E-Wallet Payment Service and Gateway Service facilitate the execution of payments from a customer to the Merchant. Any payment monies collected from customers and received by OKPAY shall be transferred into the Merchant Account immediately after deduction of any fees due to OKPAY.
4.2. The Merchant is aware that the receipt of a payment into the Merchant Account does not amount to the receipt of cleared funds.
The Merchant remains liable to OKPAY for the full amount of the payment and any fees deducted therefrom (the "Reversal Amount") if the payment is later reversed for any reason. In case of such a payment reversal, OKPAY will first debit the Merchant Account with the Reversal Amount and any applicable third party chargeback or reversal fee. If OKPAY is unable to fully recover the Reversal Amount and the applicable third party chargeback or reversal fee from the Merchant Account (including any monies transferred into it after the payment reversal), it reserves the right to invoice the Merchant for the unrecovered balance.
4.3. OKPAY reserves the right to suspend, at any time and at its sole discretion, the Merchant Account (or certain functionalities thereof such as uploading, receiving, sending and/or withdrawing funds) if transactions are made which OKPAY in its sole discretion deems to be (i) made in breach of this Agreement or (ii) are suspicious with regards to money laundering, terrorism financing, fraud or other illegal activities. OKPAY will make reasonable efforts to inform the Merchant of any measure unless OKPAY is prohibited from doing so by law or under an order from a competent court or authority.

Hi there OP, is good that you circle back with them... will give benefit of doubt that your folly is not coming from a place of malice. however, it is not same model as a traditional exchange. At all... forgive my tone if it comes across as gruff, but the US enforcement actions are nothing to joke about or take lightly....
When you sign up with bitstamp or Gemini etc, they are becoming fiduciary on your funds. They also KYC you and every other user of their platform... there are zero anonymous accounts in these situations. Trader is then able to trade dollar credits for bitcoin credits on said platform freely in the centralized order book &amp; matching engine. If a trader wishes to then withdraw actual assets, the exchange fiduciary is on the hook if they are remitting to criminal entities. You will also need the licensing per-state, which is much higher than 1M for all USA when all is said and done.
Now, here’s the rub. As if that wasn’t enough headache: If you as tetra do compliant KYC in every user of the platform, they must be trading directly with you and your bank accounts, and you are then indeed a broker/exchange like stamp or coinbase. And that is totally fine and dandy too. But, if you merely KYC them and allow them to trade directly with each other as private traders, and also can’t or don’t or won’t provide each traders PERSONAL AND PRIVATE details to each other instantly/automatically/always - then there is problem because the traders do not “know” each other and will fail their reporting requirements, which could very well put them in hot water to say the least. Also, then you’re in the business of transferring lots of sensitive private info to individuals who may or may not know how to securely store/protect that info...
It’s actually worse risk for them than it is for tetra... the burden of compliance is on the individuals trading in the US states.... so they need to do their own KYC and/or have licenses... unless you are the direct broker/trader with them, but then you would still need the relevant licenses to facilitate the 2 legged trade....

That's a rather funny advert, but just FYI, our 3 bulk note ATMs in NYC (Bronx, Harlem, and Sheepshead Bay locations) already do this for you.
30 bills accepted in one stack. Want more? Just auth &amp; keep going... Where else can you turn phyiscal cash into bitcoin without talking to a human in just a few short moments?
Avg user transaction time is under 1 minute... 
 
**Those 3 bulk notes are located at:**
Barber shop on 167th between Walton &amp; Grand Concourse in the Bronx
Apolo fruit &amp; deli on 126th &amp; Frederick Douglas in Harlem

With all due respect, if you take a bitcoin ATM to a meeting or gathering, people certainly **are** buying directly from you, since you are there in person watching over the tiny bread box sized machines that can easily disappear. Also, the small machines generally don't have any AML capabilities, either. They become quite the hassle for the operator...
This defeats the purpose of an Automated Teller Machine.... They are meant to be remote and in any area, which is why you find regular ATMs all over the place: Convenience for the end user.
As for "an add-on for a local business"... heh. I take it you've not ever operated an ATM before? It's quite a bit more work than just plugging in some hardware and expecting one's bank account to grow.... There's lot of work involved, and the business owner has an existing business to run already.

Hi there,
You are in the unfortunate situation of being a Greek with money in Greek Banks.
As far as the rest of the world is concerned, the digital euros in your account are effectively worthless, so no other bank abroad or financial institution of any kind will accept your funds anywhere near a 1:1 ratio (if they even will accept at all), because the issuing bank (your Greek Bank) is basically in open default.
The money in your bank is effectively Monopoly Money. If you have physical Euros in your hand, you are in slightly better shape, because those physical Euros will at least work in other EU nations. However, their value purchasing power compared to the rest of the world currencies (GBP, JPY, USD, etc) will be significantly lower.
If you wish to obtain bitcoins, you can not currently do it with the digital Euros in any of your financial institutions (unless they are accounts in other countries) but instead must rely on hoping to find a human being to exchange physical Euro for BTC, or the one ATM in Athens to insert Euro and get BTC.
Best of luck.
*Silver lining: once your country is kicked out of the Euro and back on drachma, everything will be dirt cheap to the rest of us and I'll finally get to visit your beautiful country on the cheap! So +tourism for you guys soon...*

Hi there,

We currently run a network of 7 ATMs. 5 in NYC and 2 in Cali. We also have a 6th on the way to Upper Manhattan and should be online soon.
Just FYI: if you go with Lamassu or Skyhook, your machines will not be compliant in the state of NY. Their current hardware simply cant support the new regulations. Check with your local jurisdiction before buying anything.
We speak daily and are very close with the manufacturers for our hardware: both BitAccess &amp; GenesisCoin. What do you wish to do? Successfully running ATMs is *much* more work than simply buying one and hooking it into your bank account....
@_date: 2015-07-04 13:21:55
That is a Satoshi 1, yes,  but it is not the first one "in the wild"
They have been out for a little while. We personally have 2 of them deployed here in NYC for couple weeks now actually. Also, ours have the additional bulk note feeders to allow the user to insert up to 30 banknotes per stack of currency (like when you deposit into a bank ATM it lets you do more than 1 bill at a time)
It is as noted, however, the only Bitcoin ATM in Greece at the moment. There are some more on the way to the troubled country as we speak.

Hi OP &amp; welcome to the world of trading. To get your average position rate:

Add up all your BTC gained. Save the number. 
Add up all your USD spent. Save the number. 
Divide total bitcoin saved number by total dollar saved number = volume weighted average fill price for while position.

It depends on how much cash value you wish to trade into/from bitcoins.
if you want to trade up to $1000 worth of BTC **in a single day** we just need your full name and street address. More than that? Up to 3k and we need a non-expired govt-issued ID. More than *that*? Contact us directly, we don't let the ATMs auto trade high value single transactions; those are all manual review. We are happy to increase/remove limits on a one-by-one VIP basis if you are legit &amp; can certify any coins you are selling, and all the cash you are buying with is legally obtained by you. 
**TL;DR**- *Full Name &amp; Street Address.*

We run the largest bitcoin ATM network in NYC. Imagining the logistics of doing what we do now, **even without** all the regulations we follow for compliance is a very large undertaking... 
Also, no offense, but the fact that you're implying you will create &amp; run your own backend is laughable. Being a full stack dev &amp; ATM operator at the same time? You are superman too, yes?
If you're truly asking these questions from a position of honest ignorance (not trolling), and you **may** only have 1 partner to help run the business, then please save yourself the headache and don't get into the field. Running ATM networks are not instant goldmines ... they are LOTS of work and require teams of people.
When ATMs pop up and then disappear a month or two later because the operator got all their bank accounts shut, or the machine never has coins, or the internet died and it takes days to fix, it looks bad on **all** ATM operators. People tend to lump everything in together good with bad.

Sorry, OP - but how exactly did you buy? 
Did you only sign up for an account and still need to verify ID, and simply sent the new account your own BTC?  Or did you actually get to send money in exchange for BTC that coinbase has given you, but now you cannot sell the BTC back for fiat in your same bank..... or is this wrong info?

It is a valid choice, sadly.
You are trying to preserve your "wealth" but that term is kind of funny because it's just a number on a screen, and when someone tells you your "number on screen" is not really the 9 you thought it was, but instead a 5... what really did the 9 mean in the first place?
If you convert your "wealth" into TVs, you will then have physical goods that *may* be able to get re-sold.... at a loss most likely, TVs don't appreciate in value last I checked. But still...
The sad choice is "something" is better than "nothing" and while a '4' is not a '9' it's not a '0' or '1' either.
@_date: 2015-07-10 14:36:25
Who is the author of this blog? So that I may correct them due to their lack of investigative reporting skills....
**They got NYC completely wrong.**
Take it from someone who lives here and **is personally** the largest ATM operator in the city.... First of all, there is some bullshit on the coinatmradar list. 2 of the ATMs are skyhooks which do not count as an ATM - they are always broken, and since we are very well connected, we know the volume for the machine at the whitehall terminal is effectively nothing and is barely used. I frequent the East Village often, and still can not find the lamassu machine that is supposedly in a french cafe/diner. Maybe it was short lived? I also believe the one in the hookah bar in the bronx also got pulled.
Regarding **actual** ATMs
"FIFO BTM" does NOT have the majority of ATMs. We do, actually. And the majority is NOT lamassu's shite garbage hardware. FIFO does, however, do a significant amount of volume. Their lamassu ATMs frequently run into hardware issues &amp; go down constantly. 
We personally own and operate FIVE ATMs in NYC. 2 are in manhattan, 2 in Brooklyn, and 1 in the Bronx. 3 are BitAccess and 2 are Genesis. A third Genesis will be deployed in Harlem in a couple days (it's currently on a truck en route here)
@_date: 2015-07-12 02:06:30
They're very slow to make updates to their map &amp; blogs. Will let them know the error when our 6th NYC machine launches this week uptown.
It's probably a sub-contracted article not written by coinATMradar itself, because we manually have to submit our locations to the website, so they definitely know our email address has submitted 5 ATMs...
Regardless, we have lots of experience with the various ATMs and their capabilities. Skyhook are effectively paperweights. And Lamassu is in very dicey territory when it comes to NY compliance. They also have tiny cash boxes which aren't worth their weight in salt for other more lenient markets either.
Don't see what offense is taken by stating any of that... 
@_date: 2015-08-19 22:27:56
Hi there,
Yes indeed our ATMs are always very active! We had applied for the BitLicense within the required timeframe, and therefore have a 'provisional' license.
We have a total of 9 ATMs in NYC now, with another 2 in California, and 2 more coming to NYC in about a week's time.  
@_date: 2015-07-14 13:15:11
That is actually the message that ships with the machines (we own 7 BA machines ourselves) and you have to manually send them a damn text file for them to upload for that field. They still do not allow the operator to change it on their own. It is not editable on the backend console. You have to "ask" to change it. It is definitely on the screen when you first plug the machine in. So yes, it's "in production" too.
OP: Don't get me started with whether they are or are not professional. Moe &amp; Haseeb, If you read this. You know damn well what is meant. Get it together already.
if has 9 machines themselves, then surely they too have similar experiences and also knows what is meant. Maybe it's better when you're domestic in CAN...
@_date: 2015-07-29 22:49:01
Some are, some aren't.... Would they ever be profitable in the middle of nowhere at a rest stop in the desert? Probably not....
We are in NYC, which has high pop density and we also happen to be very large OTC traders originally, with a decent customer base.... So one would imagine that seriously helps our machine volume... 
Aside from that, the cost of legal compliance is *very* high. Not getting into exact numbers, but I do not see how this would be profitable in NY state if you're paying for compliance with profits from just a single machine or two. We can absorb compliance cost across multiple machines..... If you were to start from scratch, it would be a mammoth task, and I wouldn't expect ROI for many months... hope you're well capitalized....
Regardless, it will probably become a full time job if you plan to keep the ATM online all the time, with enough coins and cash management in place to keep generating new coins.
Best of luck!
@_date: 2015-07-20 14:35:25
Online bitcoin trading and newbies really don't mix well.... They simply don't know how to spot nefarious activity. And honestly, why should they? They would have no prior experience to know what to look out for. It's like expecting a dog to play Mozart. Allowing someone who's not been around the block a few times to trade bitcoins for gift cards is like leading lambs to slaughter.... 
We personally do not accept gift cards **at all** anymore, and we've been trading for very long time.

.... wow... just..... wow.... TIL coinbase allows anonymous purchases of bitcoin with credit cards... Not only does that seem orthogonal to their KYC policies (and therefore BSA laws which could put Armstrong in orange) but it's just flat out silly from a risk perspective.
RIP coinbase.. 
Looks like they are flying a little too high to the sun and gonna get burnt by the CC fraud/reversals or fines/jail.
This is gonna give all of us regulated entities bad juju when it implodes :(

Depends on your city and how many ATMs you want. 
It's much more difficult than simply buying hardware and plugging it in... We currently have 6 in NYC and 2 in Cali.
They are a full time job in and of themselves, forget about any existing OTC business.  It's not a one-person job, so hope you have help that you can trust.
Expect to spend lots of hours dealing with customer support issues with broken hardware/internet issues and compliance, or simply trying to explain to people how to use the machine, or what bitcoin even is.

Please see the bitcoin core 0.12 release notes - newly released &amp; is live just the other day.
Opt-in RBF is now enabled. This would fix your problem if you were using bitcoin core.
@_date: 2016-02-24 23:32:30
My core node has done this correctly for months, i tweaked its behavior myself.
For the uninitiated, now, bitcoin core in version 0.12 has similar features to my mods, stock out of the box. So anyone who is running core can now optimize their fees similar to how my node has always done it, and ensure every single transaction they send will in fact make it into the next block or two...
I completely agree these things are not made apparent to the casual user, and all wallet software should be more obvious as to what will happen when a transaction gets sent.

Simple answer? Because too many people are using it. It's gotten too popular for that use case!
Alternate answer? It's still orders of magnitude cheaper than sending comparable amounts as fiat.

Jesse is a pretty good guy and has been around the bitcoin space for quite some time. I had the pleasure of meeting him in person when he came to NY to visit my office years ago, although we have not yet had any business dealings.  Glad his exchange got you sorted out!
**Friendly Reminder::**
When you're sending bitcoin from your old mining node (or any other wallet) to Kraken (or any exchange/person for that matter), make sure you are including the best/most optimal mining fee so the transaction can get credited quickly.  You can always gauge the current fees as Satoshis-per-byte by viewing: 
At the time of this post, it's looking like around 100 satoshi/byte is good to use.

Well, if you send something with too little of a fee ratio, it could get "stuck" for quite some time, as there would be other higher fee transactions for miners to be including, and your low-fee transaction would remain unconfirmed until the global network worked through the backlog... but yes, the difference is a few pennies in USD spot value. Approx 30-60 cents or so right now.
Then also, there are are some people who believe bitcoin would be **much** more valuable in the future than it is today, so those extra satoshi may eventually add up to something very significant...... or not.

Erik, could not agree less....
The world works based on the price of things in a currency unit of account, which in turn give those things value. All of those examples are generic orderbooks valuing one thing in something else - sure - but they are all based on the underlying fiat value of the chair or carpet tile to make that rate palpable. Someone had to decide (you or the hungry person) how many bitcoins a pizza is worth....  No one would trade lawn chairs for Xboxes because Xboxes are not liquid and fungible or easy to store/transmit.  And I don't know any real estate developers who are flipping buildings for diamonds... You have to (currently) use fiat because it is the smooth grease that moves the wheels of commerce.
You most certainly do need to create your own ecosystem if you do not wish to play by government rules. If at any point in the other side of those 200k transactions, the bitcoins get turned into dollars, euros, yen, etc - the trader becomes subject to that jurisdiction's rules because they're now using that jurisdiction's fiat currency... and are storing that govt fiat in state-protected insured banks...
It's also little disingenuous to say all 200k daily blockchain transactions are 'non-fiat' when we all know plenty of the daily transactions are housekeeping tasks between businesses' wallets or inside one's own wallet.... forget the obvious fact that vast majority of blockchain activity involve exchanges or merchant processors -- which all exist because people are trying to get fiat from their bitcoin in the first place... 
The meme from the Matrix with Neo asking question to Morpheus best encapsulates this, paraphrasing: "One day you're saying I can sell my bitcoin for millions of dollars??! --- No, I'm saying one day when you are ready, you will not need to."

After verification, all of the Cottonwood Vending bitcoin kiosks are 7% over bitcoinaverage for trades $2000 and up... And this drops even further to 5% for trades of 5k USD and up. The rates are tiered: the more cash per transaction, the lower the markup. These are arguably the cheapest rates for legal cash conversion from a kiosk in about a thousand miles of the big apple... All of those locations are on the map here: 
If you want to buy on exchange with no markup, then you will need to link your bank account to another licensed entity, like Gemini or itBit. Gemini does ACHs and free deposits, by the way.

Got you covered. Here's a crash course on mining transaction fees:
Your bitcoin wallet app is *supposed* to get you the "best fee" automagically.... problem is, sometimes the apps don't calculate it correctly, or are using hard-coded fee numbers (old software)
Each bitcoin transaction is a certain amount of "size" similar to the filesize of the pictures or documents on your hard drive. This size is determined by the number of inputs and outputs of the transaction. Most normal bitcoin transactions are 1 or 2 inputs and 1 or 2 outputs. These typical transactions come out to a size of around 227 bytes, give or take; this is the sum of the letters and numbers that makes up the actual hexcode transaction which is broadcast to all the other nodes around the world. The global miners are incentivized to include a new transaction into a new block based on its fee ratio of filesize to mining fee. Wallet software is **supposed** to monitor the recent transactions on the network &amp; the newest blocks, and calculate what fees were paid on the transactions that actually were put into the blocks. This can then be analyzed to see what fee it took to get into those blocks, and with a reasonable amount of certainty one can gauge how much fee it will take for the next block...
Because there is variance and each miner is a unique snowflake who can choose their own rules for inclusion, it's not something that can be 100% predicted all the time. It's kind of a living, breathing thing, this "optimal" fee rate. 
You would view the chart to see visually what the recent blocks &amp; estimates are looking like if you want to check the wallet software's fee math yourself. This way you can see in advance an idea of how long it will take to confirm
Here's a little real world example, right now... the fee estimate from bitcoin core is 0.00198896 and is denominated as bitcoins per kilobyte... So, to get the Satoshis-per-byte it's simple as turning the bitcoin value into satoshi (multiply by 100000000) and then drop down from kilobyte to byte - so you get 0.00198896*100000000 = 198896 / 1024 = 194.234375 Satoshi-per-byte estimate for including a transaction within 2 blocks (according to bitcoin core's estimates)
You might say: 194? isn't that a little high for right now? The answer is YES! Yes, it is a bit too high for right now, and you would be wasting some satoshis needlessly, because the magic fee estimation isn't always 100% correct.... this is why it's wise to monitor the fees yourself so you can check the calculations and adjust accordingly so as to not spend too much or too little!

As for us: Our machines actually exist physically right now, and have been operating for weeks, accepting stacks of cash from people and turning them into bitcoins very quickly.

@_date: 2017-04-30 14:45:32
Common misconception that the fiat value of the bitcoins, or the absolute amount of bitcoin/satoshi transferred has anything to do with the required mining fee.
**It does not.**
Mining fee ratio is entirely based on the filesize of the transaction, which is all about how many inputs and outputs the transaction contains.
If your $70 are from a wallet that got them as 70 x $1 chunks of bitcoin sent to it over time, like from a faucet, the single outgoing $70 transaction would require *much* more mining fees than if someone had sent you $100 in one shot and you then sent that $100 as $70 to recipient destination and $30 as change back to yourself.
First scenario is 70 inputs and 1 or 2 outputs, second scenario is 1 input and 2 outputs. Same dollar value, same bitcoin value. Completely different filesize.
@_date: 2017-04-20 16:59:34

OP, with all due respect, if you don't want to deal with "the state" then don't use fiat money *at all*. Use **only** bitcoin or other crypto, and then DON'T price things "in dollars" or "in euros" to pay for that "value" in bitcoins.  
That is still effectively using fiat.
If a case of soda cost $100 and you paid $100 "worth of bitcoin", the vendor needs to buy more soda with USD because no wholesaler takes BTC nor do they price their goods in crypto. So, again, there is still a ton of FIAT used in the transaction. The base underlying "value" is fiat. Bitcoin is just a means of transferring that "value" from the end retailer to the wholesaler...
AFAIK: there is absolutely **nothing** priced *directly in bitcoin* that doesn't fluctuate with a spot market "price of bitcoin"
Don't get it twisted.... if there's a shred of govt money involved, you gotta play by their rules.  That's just how the world works.
If you want to play by your own rules - you need to create your entire own ecosystem, and that means pricing things directly IN the arbitrary token of bitcoin, like bartering...... Similar to 50k BTC for a pizza........ 
Everything still anchors into a fiat currency... Just sayin'

Hi there,
You can legally purchase as much bitcoin as you like, with cash, from the many Cottonwood Vending bitcoin kiosks in NYC &amp; Long Island. Currently there are 45 convenient locations. Map &amp; store hours here:  -
 The accounts department does manual verification to raise your limits beyond the machines automatic limits, too. 
That means after you are verified, you can easily purchase all 8 bitcoins in one transaction, and since it's over $5k in USD value, the trade would be only a 5% rate; which is arguably one of the cheapest rates anywhere for convenient &amp; instant cash into bitcoin.

The license is to transact with Virtual Currency. The definition of *Virtual Currency* enumerates the types of things the regulation determines to be covered by that wording. Alt-coins, and other crypto-currencies (but not in-game credits or store loyalty points) are pretty plainly in there.
Not sure what is unclear about it. The license is not specific to bitcoin, it is all *Virtual Currency.* If you read a little further, just 2 pages later...
On Page 7, section 200.3(a) it states: *License required. No Person shall, without a license obtained from the superintendent as provided in

It depends on the country you are in and also what "end result asset" you wish to get for your bitcoins: fiat in a bank account, or physical cash in hand, or digital gift codes, etc...
If you are in the US, and you want fiat in a bank account, we highly recommend you use a domestic legitimate regulated exchange, like Gemini or itBit.  If you're outside the US, the recommendation is to use Bitstamp or Kraken and NOT Bitfinex or BTCe or OKCoin. Those last 3 are having banking issues right now and the price reflected on those exchanges is not indicative to the true price of bitcoin, but more people's fears and liquidity issues...
if you want physical cash in hand, and happen to be in the NYC area, we have a network of kiosks for you to trade bitcoins for physical cash. You would be charged 3% for the cash conversion from bitcoin at our machines. You can pick up this cash for your coins at any of the blue pins on our website map:  -- If you're in other areas, there are other kiosks in those areas too operated by different companies and/or people with which we have no affiliation. 
There is also localbitcoins if you want to trade peer to peer and figure out a custom method of payment to suit. There is just about every payment method traded on LBC.... The site itself is most certainly not a scam, however, you should be very aware of what you are doing and read up first on anyone you decide to trade with.

You may have thought the transaction was urgent, however you did not send it with "urgent" fees.
This is a problem primarily with your wallet, as it is not properly estimating fee, and your transaction will remain in limbo for a while considering the rest of the current network snapshot.
**TL;DR:** Use a different mobile wallet.

Unfortunately, not all exchanges provide full depth of market.
You will not be able to ascertain this information without the exchange providing it first.
Personally, I would argue the list of time &amp; sales (not the real time orderbook) would give you the best indication for an exchange's liquidity. If there is lots of ticks and big orders going off all the time, then that is a sign of a heavily used exchange. Whether or not it is a robot trading with itself, if you can get your own order filled quickly, it should be all the same to your account balance...

This is not *exactly true*.. It is not technically a "currency" in the sense that you can use it to buy goods services from every merchant or pay bills everywhere.... the counter-party needs to **want** to accept it. They are not forced to accept it (like fiat money)
What it really is, is an irrevocable, very divisible, wealth transfer between 2 (or more) parties either across the table, or around the world and does not need involve custodial middlemen.  
Since that "wealth" is in the form of this digital bitcoin "thing", that makes it technically bartering. Just like if you were paying someone with a few bits of gold dust or a case of their favorite sodas.

To be fair: The show did make the strong point a few times that the sentence actually issued to Mr. Ulbricht seemed way more than it should've been for the convicted crimes. The violent crimes he was sentenced for were never used in actual jury record (but the judge factored them in for sentencing, which is technically, and legally, wrong)  And they also correctly note his case is on appeal.  
At the end of the day, he **did** break the law (regarding the illicit substance marketplace), but the sentence most feel was way too harsh.... **Very curious** if the color of his skin helps with this appeal..... time will tell...... the judge was very clear that she sentenced harshly "to prevent future similar crimes by others" but the show also points out (and even shows the onion url) of what they say is the largest DNM, apparently orders of magnitude bigger than SR ever was...... so, good job, judge.... /s
Maybe the Andy Greenberg interviews were how the show tried to counter-balance the nuances of the case and cast the real negative light on the 2 corrupt government agents.
The show correctly illustrates how bitcoin is also the farthest thing from anonymity...
One thing to notice: was the show's *very* lax take on technical details of how "tor servers leak IPs every so often" - which, pretty sure is not true... They never quite say exactly how the IP of the server was discovered. Just that it eventually was found.

@_date: 2017-09-04 14:13:34
uh... there is an issue with this transaction here, and not bitcoin in general. As others have pointed out, the fees you are paying were far greater than the normal.
Furthermore, the behavior of this transaction is **very weird** if you say it's indeed from Xapo.
 explore...
Just going off your screenshot evidence &amp; the public blockchain...
This does not appear to be a standard "large service" transaction... meaning, xapo appears to *not* be grouping together multiple people's transactions into a single send. Which is preferred behavior for all large services and companies that do lots of transactions, like a hosted wallet or exchange. My company (one of the largest bitcoin kiosk networks) does many many transactions per day, and utilizes a grouping mechanism that I developed to save space on the blockchain and also save fees by sending multiple transactions bundled together. Many other companies do the same or similar things. This helps reduce overall mempool consumption, block space, and ultimately lowers fees for **everyone**.   And... maybe they are grouping, and at the time of your withdrawal there was simply no one else withdrawing.... but even if that's the case....
This transaction you pasted appears to be using 2 inputs with one of them (the 0.001) being "untouched" showing up as the same amount in the outputs, and, also un-needed for the transaction to send the 0.002705 (which, based on what you said, is your withdraw)
If you are saying **you** are paying the entire fee, then who/what the hell is the 0.001 for? We'll call this "the other person" for clarity... I'm assuming the 2.0xx amount is the service's change address.
There are few possible scenarios here:
1. You are misrepresenting what that transaction is. (it's not really your withdraw from xapo)
2. You are not actually paying the *whole* fee for the transaction. (sharing it with the other person)
3. You are paying the whole fee (and so is the other person, you just don't know/see it)
4. You are paying the whole fee (and the other person is not)
Based on what you're saying and the screenshots, it does in fact seem real &amp; that xapo is taking the entire fee from *your* chunk of coins in *your* hosted account - which is weird/wrong/unfair to say the least. Unless of course, you signed some terms of service agreement that indicates their fees.... did you?
I would advise you to try to contact their support and rectify this. I feel that as a company, to be as transparent as possible, the mining fee should be split evenly amongst all the customer outputs, or they as company should eat the fee entirely from the change output (my company fully pays our own mining fees)
However, if they are doing  from above, that is very "interesting" to extract excessive fees from all the customers... to say the least.... 
Finally - their math is gnarly; they rounded up a satoshi extra from your screenshot evidence.... 0.00201894 + 0.002705 = 0.00472394 -- but your account screenshot shows minus 0.00472395  -- so even if you are paying the entire fee from just your chunk, they are still adding an extra satoshi deduction from a rounding error... lol wow.... that kind of rounding math stuff adds up to major problems over time...
*If they are an honest operation, I would fully expect them to investigate and fix the situation... if, of course, what we've discovered is in fact true and is brought to their light....*

hate to be pedantic but.....
Fractional Reserves implies one actually has a bank account that has *some* amount of actual fiat reserves...


Tether, on the other hand, is printing millions of new tokens "just because"
And, the tether-based exchanges are by no means an insignificant part of the market ecosystem... bitfinex and poloniex are two very well-known and widely used exchanges that don't have a shred of real USD on them, yet plenty of asset pairs trading one crypto against "USD"...
Finally, regarding Gox... the price was elevated there not really because of fractional reserve, as gox did no loans or investments of any kind, but because they lost BTC from hacks (allegedly, to the operators of BTC-e of all places) and were then insolvent when people made a run on their now-dwindled reserves;  people could not get their money out of the exchange in USD form, and instead had to buy up BTC to withdraw (until that too ran dry)

This will increase significantly when core finally releases 0.15.1 so change addresses by default can be segwit (it's not making it into the 0.15 release unfortunately)
currently, right now, the only way to get a segwit change address is by crafting raw transactions - which is a dangerous thing to do... so when it's a part of the normal RPC and GUI commands, i wager will have much more widespread adoption.

Hi there OP.
I feel like I must clarify something... Even though one of the CSRs from coinbase posted in this thread with a link to the fee schedule, it is worth noting that Coinbase and GDAX (same company) have different trading structures.
Coinbase is a direct broker-dealer style trade. You are trading directly with the company (ie, coinbase is selling you their bitcoins for your cash, or vice versa) and incur the relevant fees listed on the linked page. Whereas GDAX is a matching engine, otherwise known as an **online exchange**..
The major difference is that with GDAX (or other true exchanges, like: Gemini, or itBit, or Bitstamp) you are trading directly with **other people** not the Coinbase/GDAX company directly. Therefore, you are getting the "free market" rates.  Please note, also, that you need to pre-fund the GDAX account in order to trade. Coinbase will allow you to trade directly from your bank account (which is why they are waiting for the ACH to clear before finalizing the trade and giving you the bitcoins)  -- also, for the record, Gemini will allow you to trade against your USD credits instantly on ACH initiation, so you can lock your price (but then you can't withdraw those resulting coins for a few days until the original ACH clears)
If you wish to stay with Coinbase/GDAX - my advice would be to get your funds out of Coinbase side and into the GDAX side of the business, this way you can buy and sell to your GDAX account wallet (again, not coinbase account wallet)
This keeps your funds digital (and, crucially, in their possession) however, the benefit of this is you can trade immediately at market price as the funds are already "on exchange"  if, however, you wish to get the cash back into your bank account for whatever reason, you will incur some bank transfer fees... Those fees further depend on if you want an ACH (wait a few days) or wire (same day)
Finally, this is directed at -- have you guys gotten enough compliance staff yet to properly handle another bitlicense entity (meaning: my company) or is GDAX still focused solely on the retail market? Let me know, I can come into the office in person &amp; say hi. We're basically neighbors...

The particular kiosk operator is choosing to keep their markups hidden. Here in NYC, we keep ours public and they are shown on screen... typical ranges for other kiosk operators around the country are anywhere from 10-20% 
With regards to automated cash trading, I have only seen the low 5% markup fee on our network of machines -and only when the user is trading $5000 or more (our machines use tiered pricing, so larger single trades = lower fee percentages)
For the record, it will always be cheaper to buy “on exchange” than with cash at any kiosk. There are much higher overhead costs for kiosk operators than with all electronic trading like coin base. The key benefits for the user of a kiosk are the *physical* cash aspect and instant gratification.

Regardless, when comparing bitcoin's historical USD quoted values to current real time quotes, it holds true for nearly every point since the genesis block, aside from a few recent weeks. You'd be doing better off, in terms of USD value, if you convert the fiat &amp; hold BTC.
Also, should go without saying, but worth always mentioning: having one's "net worth" entirely in one "thing" is .... effectively gambling. 
 Putting all eggs in that one basket? Perhaps not the wisest financial idea.....
@_date: 2017-09-09 13:54:55
2.1 Trillion is indeed "a lot", but, is certainly not the ceiling of money..... There's plenty more wealth than that just in USA alone..... And, that's not even factoring in the rest of the world's wealth!
The problem with your postulation is that you're looking to "ride the next unicorn" and "get rich quick" from bitcoin in terms of fiat money.
Suggestion: instead, forget that bitcoin even has "a price" .... Remember, it goes down 8 decimal points... You are thinking of it just as a single unit.
In the end: BTC will either be priceless, or worthless. There is no in-between. Either, in a few years, you will not be able to get rid of BTC for anything of value (completely useless crap tokens) **or** each full coin will be around the equivalent of an original Picasso. 
Your decision, therefore, should not be a question of "how much is it going to be worth", and instead should be "do you think it's *worthless*, or *priceless*?"
Personally, I'm in the latter camp... 
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:11:19
History tells us this is the correct answer. 
Dollar cost averaging at *any* points in the past will have yielded solid fiat profits for the trader as the asset has increased in value tremendously since we are at ATH currently.  
If the price dropped far below your average...... don't panic! just keep buying on schedule as planned, and similarly your average price will drop too. Then when the BTC spot price pops back over your average.... it's like magic! you're entire position is back in the money....  
If you wish to "hodl" and don't want to try and predict the tops and bottoms, then dollar cost averaging is a very good trading strategy.
 Remember: No one has a crystal ball.... 
The way I look at it is this: BTC will either be worthless, or priceless. There is no middle ground. It's binary. Either you won't be able to get rid of them for any amount of value....... or...... each coin will be like an original Picasso.  
@_date: 2017-09-03 20:13:25
*.....if only it were real*
tethers are not supposed to be "created" without corresponding USD in bank accounts held in reserve...... but tether has no bank accounts anymore. There is no reserve. There is no way to send them more USD as all US institutions have blackballed them. They cannot receive new money and cannot disperse old money (if there is even any real USD left in the organization)
That ~370M ([your figure of 340 is wrong]( is all ghost. It's not real. 
Conversely, things like LTC or even BCH are actual other "things" that are not willy-nilly minted in large chunks whenever the creators so choose.
That's exactly the kind of behavior that caused everyone to scorn the central banks!! And is precisely the environment that has birthed our beloved bitcoin

Ha, no.. sadly the current core client overestimates the fees way way too much. I already run my code on top of headless bitcoind &amp; my logic constantly sets the fee to pay based on the current network environment.
Suppoedly 0.15 is going to have much better fee estimation, but from browsing the code, it's mostly geared towards retail users (of which, i am not) 
...but it's certainly a step in the right direction!

The best answer to "why did you buy bitcoin in 2017?" is "....because i didn't do it earlier"
You will either look back at this decision in 5 or so years and realize it is what made you very wealthy, or you will look back and laugh about that time you lost some cash on this magic internet money....  As long as you don't invest more than you can afford to burn/lose, you will be a-ok. 
....And whatever you do, don't ever sell for a loss....

The only "fees" are a flat markup/markdown from live market rates. The displayed rate is based off bitcoinaverage and constantly varies depending on market liquidity and volatility. The rate number on the physical ATM touchscreen is exactly WYSIWYG
TL;DR - Generally, when user is buying coins, they will pay between ~12-15% markup and when user is selling coins, it's ~5% markdown
***These are the rates as they exist today. We are working with the manufacturer to allow for custom pricing for fully verified users (think: the more you verify, the better the rate)
@_date: 2015-09-22 12:22:51
Vlad, with all due respect, and as you well know, there are a few employees we have helping with the online marketing. The ones you speak to on email are not the most informed and merely copy-pasted our previous ads instead of using the correct information they were instructed to use.  
You also have not been forthcoming with removing older images from locations for machines that no longer exist. 3 locations of ours still mention previous hardware that was removed over a month ago, and there are a number of other locations not owned/operated by us that have yet to be removed from the map entirely.  For an example, one of our older locations that had its hardware switched was this one: 
And because the listing was not properly updated when we had asked and submitted the new photos initially, users were confused and on sept 4 someone wound up thinking it was still a 2-way location and travelled out of their way to go and use it.
So my comment on 3rd party webmasters not being quick &amp; responsive to the contents of the ATM listings remains true. Since we don't have control over those listings, people really cant trust with 100% everything that they say unfortunately.
@_date: 2015-09-21 22:56:20
With all due respect to circle and coinbase, they don't deal with the physical cash itself. Our ATMs do. There are lots of costs associated with handling and processing physical cash.
Also, many people **don't have bank accounts** and can't use circle or coinbase because they don't have anything to link up with. 
Bitcoin is great for the unbanked to be able to take their actual cash and turn it into something that can be used to make online purchases.
@_date: 2015-09-21 22:26:26
Ok, because it seemed like you implied that the either we or ATM were untruthful to you, which is not the case. Our rates are always stated on the ATM screen itself before any cash is inserted.  It is difficult or in some cases impossible to display the ATMs rate to 3rd party websites where we don't control how the pages are updated.
Hopefully, since you make time-sensitive transactions, you now see the value in having a machine in NYC that accepts cash and is available all the time - also at your leisure.

Yo, OP!
You rock. Have an upvote, this is a nice info site!!
Question: any specific p2p/network or relay fee settings on this node, or is it stock vanilla core bitcoind? What language(s) did you code it in?
Couple suggestions:
1. when you mouseover, it would be nice to show all Y values for that X time underneath the mouse cursor, not just the one value...
2. are you using the 'vsize' or 'size' for each mempool entry? (ie, is it properly factoring in the witness weight) ?
3. consider adding longer timeframes beyond 24hr... I'm assuming, however, that you recently just made this so data is not yet available...
Guessing you already know of  right?
Keep up the good work!

Cybersecurity is a large aspect of overall security nowadays. We take the threat of hacking and leaks very seriously.

Hi - Thanks for pointing that out, the stated fee of 8-12 is not correct, it is frequently closer to 20-25% right after a weekend. In fact, 4 days ago when you messaged directly asking about what the rate was, we replied it was around 15-18%, which, at the time, was indeed correct.... Didn't realize there were adverts that say '8-12' - those should not exist, they are out-dated.
There is a very complex algorithm that handles the pricing across our network and factors in cash processing and compliance fees. The machine in Harlem you used did the correct rate for the time when you traded earlier. It always says on the screen of the ATM what the rate will be **before** you put any money into the machine, so it shouldn't have been that surprising unless you went too fast and didn't check the price shown on the screen.
Will get around to updating the online adverts today, but some webmasters are not quick to respond to our edits.   Please remember to always check the price on the ATM itself in the future.
@_date: 2015-09-19 15:57:29
Clever. It appears to be a twilio-style app that allows users to interact via texting to get deposit instructions and utilize a private wallet service. Whomever runs the twilio app also runs the bitcoin node and controls all the keys. 
Given that it's available to anyone with the internet, if this entity in AUS doesn't record the proper data for New York residents/businesses that use their service, they would be technically breaking NY state law. The service holds user funds on their behalf &amp; also allows for the transmission of digital currency too.
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:57:39
whoa whoa whoa now. hang on and let's back this trolley up, shall we?  No one said anything about an attack, or that it was the OP's fault.
"offer an opt-in solution" ? what in the world are you talking about? Everyone already HAS an 'opt-in' solution... It's called your own wallet with your own private keys..... The OP is complaining two things: 1, doesn't know how to access airdropped tokens, and 2, is fearful of "missing out" on this "free money" - OP can simply withdraw his BTC and learn how to split his coins from this wonderful resource called Google. 
Retort for this: Why does coinbase have to hold OP's hand? Can coinbase charge him a fee for the coddling &amp; special help? Would you be cool with that? What fee is then "too much" ?  I'll gladly offer my time/services and help people split their coins..... for 50% of the tokens. Is that price gouging or am I giving them 50% of something they would never have figured out how to do on their own, which is better than nothing, right? Would that be ok for coinbase to also do? ... kinda messed up, eh - see what i mean?
Coinbase/GDAX and every other exchange are not stopping the users from withdrawing coins and figuring out how to "split" their coins on their own.
Let's not forget that coinbase is in the business of **trading** assets, and they can certainly choose which new assets they wish to allow for trading on their platform.
Why should coinbase (or anyone else) rush and spend development time &amp; fiduciary risk on something that is not their primary business? It's arbitrary and capricious to dictate specifically *what* assets a private exchange should list. Especially when a lots of evidence points to this BTCG 'thing' as being just another 'shitcoin'. And it's further nonsensical to force/expect coinbase help their users split other airdrop tokens. Why aren't there posts lamenting about them not helping users get Byteball, hmm?  
I completely disagree this has anything to do with your analogy of gas and the procurement/refinement of petrochemicals. 


What does that even mean? That the coinbase wallet app doesn't have segwit addresses or something? There are many bitcoin wallets for OP to use...... Coinbase/GDAX primary business is trading bitcoin, the app is just a helper/companion/data-mine. And frankly, it's not even a very good wallet. A good portion of our kiosk traders have issues when sending bitcoins from a Coinbase wallet. There is something funky they do with fee estimation and some small amount of satoshis get taken out of the recipient address, which frequently breaks payment request QRs. But, I digress. That's beside the point.
Lastly, and most importantly, OP (and anyone else with an account) does not own **any** bitcoins when they are **on** coinbase/GDAX. OP has basically an IOU from coinbase to deliver X amount of BTC. Age-old wisdom in this digital world is *You don't own crypto without the private keys.*

Interesting. 
So, instead of risking their own servers crashing (again) coinwallet has opted to post waves of privkeys from the massive array they have assembled from the previous 'stress test' into public forum posts....
Before anyone thinks they can go ahead and score free coins, please be aware there are already scripts that trawl the boards looking for privkeys that auto-consolidate and send the value elsewhere... the owners of those nodes are going to be in for a bit of a shock...
Which is why I actually laughed out loud when looking at the +100mb mempool right now. They managed to shift the burden of signing and sending the transactions from their own servers to random users/bots around the world who are now processing the privkeys for them.
All because it's a 'giveaway' *pretty clever.*

It's understandable for you to find frustration if you're not used to the 'why' it's required.
Please be assured: It's nothing personal, but our machines are public-facing and need to be secured against all types of people, not just honest people...
It's worth noting if you're purchasing bitcoins with legally obtained cash, we have no problem trading **whatever amount is desired** *(provided we have sufficient documentation on the source of the cash used in the trade)*  There is nothing 'preventing' the actual trading with or obtaining bitcoins from a licensed entity.
The only thing that is 'prevented' is keeping oneself anonymous from the licensed entity (in this case, our ATMs) 
@_date: 2015-09-20 13:59:47


Then they can use their cell phone to authenticate with the machine and follow our stated rules. There is nothing stopping them from buying what they wish once the they are authenticated properly and we have sufficient information for the daily trade size.
If you feel like there should NOT be any currency laws, you are free to run for elected office yourself and **change the laws you disagree with**.  We are not forcing anyone to use bitcoin, nor our machines. If access is wished, we simply need the legally required information from the user.
No one is framing anyone as a criminal. Whether KYC is a good or bad idea is also a moot point. It is currently against the law for us to allow trades **without** taking the proper information first. And we are not interested in breaking any laws. So, unless someone repeals the relevant law requiring us to obtain this info, our machines will continue to operate as they do to remain compliant.

OOH! A fun thought experiment! :D
According to google, there are 3billion people on the internet. Clearly there is some estimation involved here.... 
[credit suisse]( has the total net worth of everyone in the world at 241 trillion (as of a few years ago, and they're projecting increases to 334 trillion by 2018)  - For our purposes let's call it an even 300 trillion.
Google has the species at 7.125 billion asses sitting on our collective rock.
So we can do some **rough** estimations here for this game. 
300 trillion / 7.125 billion = $42,105.26 (if everything was split evenly, which it isn't but just bear with me since the wealth distribution in the world is so skewed, that all internet users would most likely have wealth. The not-yet-on-the-internet humans basically are impoverished)
Since there is this great disparity and global poverty, let's just consider the 3 billion internet users and the full wealth. 300 trillion / 3 billion = 100k
So, ~100k is what everyone has as their net worth. That means everyone needs to hold about $1000 as bitcoin to have 1% of their net worth in this asset form. At current spot price, that's like 4.21 bitcoin
**SO!** *Now we're talking!* 
3 billion people purchasing 4.21 bitcoins.... Truly there is no way to determine where the price would settle, but it would be somewhere between the sky and the moon! There is nowhere near enough coins that will ever even exist to cover this!  We would need 12.63 billion bitcoin to make everyone happy!!! Since bitcoin is hard locked at 21million units, this leads us to a factor of 601x greater!  If the spot price were to reach an equilibrium to match this hypothetical scenario, market price would be little over 142k USD per bitcoin. 
**TL;DR: ~142,000 USD per bitcoin. Super rough math.**
Edit: spelling &amp; typos
@_date: 2015-09-15 23:31:34
To be completely pedantic, bitcoin is worth that right now......... so long as you can find someone to pay the price!
As far as the 'spot market price' reaching 5000 USD per bitcoin, that is entirely debatable and completely up to people in general. Simple supply and demand. 
Unfortunately no way to predict with any certainty. 
But if you've got a few bucks to burn, the general wager is that **if** bitcoin is around in a few years, it would indicate *more* people using it than there are now, and therefore more wealth needs to be transferred through the system leading to a higher spot price. **OR** it will not exist (possibly supplanted by something else) and/or become worthless. We personally believe in the 'bitcoin will still be here' scenario, however no one has a crystal ball to tell the future.

Well, from a frankly legal perspective, if we *DIDN'T* isolate an individual's profile via cell phone number there would be nothing stopping any criminally minded individual from "breaking" the limits and doing countless $50 trades one after another to wind up trading tens of thousands of dollars in a single day. **Which, if you don't take verifiable ID information to prevent against abuse, is completely and totally illegal**. Therefore, we limit the users of our systems to only those with cell phone numbers, so we can enforce the stated limits in our AMLKYC policy.

Hi there,
We have a few ATMs in NYC that allow for the dispensing of cash when you send them BTC. 
Two are in Manhattan vape shops called The Henley Vaporium, one in SoHo at 23 Cleveland Place, between Spring &amp; Kenmare streets; and the other at 350 3rd ave between 25 &amp; 26th streets. We also have a third machine that dispenses cash which is in bushwick, brooklyn at Vape Supply Co on 40 Bushwick Ave.
Machine sends SMS code for cash redeem after the coin tx has 1 confirm on chain.

You are reading it wrong. 
As this message is typed, the global price as reported by bitcoinaverage's API is 616.31 .... and the machine rate is a tiered % above this rate based on the trade's cash amount. So here's an example: Depending on how much cash you insert, the effective rate will be either 616.31 * 1.072 = 660.68432 rate for $2000 or more, vs 616.31 * 1.16 = 714.9196 rate for up to $499 inserted. The rate middle tier of 500 - 1999 is 12%
Please note, since the time of the previous message you are commenting on, the upper tier was lowered from 8% to 7.2%
Again, by going to coinatmradar you can see the live reported prices &amp; effective machine rates at your leisure.

Actually, what keeps the mempool "full" is these garbage transactions... I run one of the largest bitcoin kiosk networks in the world, and my production node sends many many MANY transactions per day. I have to constantly monitor the mempool and see all sorts of shenanigans at play.  Any given bitcoin transaction, by default, will stay in a node's mempool for 3 days before it is dropped/scrubbed from memory... unless it gets rebroadcast &amp; relayed for free of course... The garbage can simply continue to get rebroadcast perpetually. This happens. Often.
You are (mostly) correct in the rest of your assessment, in that all normal users need fees higher than this "wall" or "floor" at 100-120 spb if they wish to get confirmed.  
However, right now there is no such thing as "time critical". There is either "you pay up and get confirmed" or "you pay less and never get confirmed"
...it's a bit more like extortion than a free auction-type market.....

Ok cool - so your problem is that the fees you sent were super-tiny. Basically you did not include enough for mining fee and the transaction is very low priority, when compared to other transactions going across the network right now.
There is currently not a large mempool so you may get lucky in a few hours and have it confirmed in a couple blocks.
**TL;DR: Just sit tight. Next time add proper mining fee (set your app to dynamically figure it out on its own, don't try and calculate fee yourself)**

They don't miss *any* fees. 
As this message is typed, there are currently 40 megs of transactions between 100-120 satoshis / byte.  And an additional 20 megs between 40-60 spb. Together just those groups of transactions are 2/3 of the global mempool, and equates to 600 blocks worth of transactions.  This is far beyond the amount of blocks needed to burn down that queue before any of those unconfirmed transactions would be scrubbed from memory pools (by default).
This causes all wallets with dynamic fee estimation to calculate a higher than needed amount for the mining fee. This behavior benefits **all** miners, as the entire mempool has elevated fees due to "whomever" made the floor at 100-120 spb.  Remember, when you want to demonize someone for this behavior, think: who benefits from an elevated, artificial fee floor? ... it's one group, and one group only: _miners_.
Most normal wallets use dynamic fee estimation which would not allow for their own sending transactions to get stuck, they would simply pay more to jump the queue.... Which is why everyone is complaining about high fees.

The lesson here has nothing to do with bitcoin. It's all about risk management.
Hopefully you have learned not to invest that which you can't afford to lose. Doesn't matter if it's bitcoin, penny stock, blue chip stock, real estate, comic books, etc.
If you follow that logic, and can afford to 'forget' about investments 'in the red', then: as long as you don't ever consummate the trade back into fiat (assuming that is what you started with to buy the asset in question) for a loss, then you will never lose money on your investments. Just weather the storm and wait before you claim profit.

First off, you need to stop using the blockchain.info wallet. Export your private keys into a proper wallet that calculates correct fees and never look back. 
Second, you should complain to roger ver, because he controls blockchain.info and has decided to freeze up a good chunk of other people's bitcoin (like yours) in the mempool so that all normal users wishing to actually get confirmations pay significantly more. 
Why is he doing this? Because he controls a few mining pools too. All elevated fees are shared amongst the miners. Your loss. His gain. 
All users of blockchain.info globally are paying the same 120 satoshi per byte mining fee for about 2 weeks now. This is what creates the massive backlog of transactions and makes yours "stuck" - it is in their interest to continue broadcasting as many stuck tx as possible at same fee calculations to keep mempool full and prolong the wait
Normal wallets that correctly set the transaction fee do not have confirmation problems, you just have to pay a few more cents than historically. This will get cheaper again in August once the network moves away from the miners stranglehold

@_date: 2017-05-12 13:19:39


LOL no it wouldn't...  I believe we're talking about different things.
I'm specifically saying there is an artificial floor of crap transactions at 100-120 satoshi/byte mining fee in the mempool. Has been there for days, and will remain there for days.
These transactions do not get mined because economic incentive of *all* miners is to include the highest spb fee transactions into blocks to get most rewards, which are real users &amp; businesses, and not these garbage spam tx.
It is TRIVIAL for any large miner or bad actor with a single wallet to devote a few bitcoins (currently this is like 45-55 BTC, overestimating)  it requires no collusion at all. You can even do it yourself!! Anyone can!  -- those coins have a very low risk of actually getting lost (read: confirmed by another miner), because they are frozen up as unconfirmed transactions that will never confirm. They exist merely to game the dynamic fee algorithms of all wallets so that normal users pay more in fees.  And if you have, say, 20% of the hashpower and get approx 20% of the blocks, you get 20% of the increased elevated fees...... your "investment" of freezing up some bitcoins in the mempool to increase the flow from legit mining fees will pay itself off in spades.
THIS is how miners make fees off empty blocks.  Each normal block right now produces around 2 BTC in fees give or take 1 BTC.  You can do the math and realize it does not take long for those frozen BTC to pay themselves back in mining rewards as the fees can remain arbitrarily high for quite literally forever.  
Expect them to go up when the miners realize they can get greedier and raise the floor.....
@_date: 2015-10-12 15:34:54
Correct. It is indeed possible 'next time' the originator of the transactions could pay more fees to clog up the memory... But who's to say what the amount they are willing to spend? Personally, I feel this is all mitigated if core nodes were able to change the min relay fee value without restarting the software. Ideally, it would be dynamic and transparent to the operator (like the estimatefee functions) and the nodes could then handle their own memory usage that way automatically. Operator would say "don't use more than X% of [or Y mb/gb] my system memory" and that is that. Node will prioritize memory pool to only have transactions included that are above the threshold and drop lowest ones if it got too filled up. 
It kind of comes down to ideology: if the 'attacker' is paying sufficient 'fees' then.... is it really an attacker; are they legitimate transactions? What exactly *is* a legitimate transaction? How much are people willing to pay for fees on their transactions before they get angry or is uneconomical for them?
Gets tricky... like playing jenga on horseback.
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:06:15
Respectfully, I don't agree with you. 
If bitcoin behaves normally with no artificial floor on the fee tiers in memory then all miners get X for the possible fees they could get from the block. 
That's how we all understood bitcoin to exist...
But once a miner figured it out, that they can simply lock up a few bitcoin in the form of thousands of transactions that go back and forth together - each with a similar fee between 100-120 satoshi per byte - it would eliminate the possibility of transactions with either the same or less mining fee than "the floor" from ever confirming. 
This now means real bitcoin users need to pay more in fees if they want to get confirmed. Fees that go to any miner in the world.
The X fees they normally got is now much larger than X, because each normal transaction is paying double or more what it would need to if there was no bullshit congestion of garbage transactions. 
It's silly to think that a few bitcoins which will never confirm or leave the miners wallet ultimately, which would generate tons more as incoming fees from the world, isn't an obvious game...
The "immediate fees" are way up for the miners. Because they are making you and everyone else pay more. 2/3 transactions in the mempool right now are not real. 
Also, mining is indeed very monopolized.... 
@_date: 2015-10-13 14:57:43
Hello OP.
The transaction you are originally inquiring about will **never** be included in a block. The reason for this is entirely because of what said above. The pieces of your transaction that create its spendable coinage were already confirmed in *other* transactions. To be exact, 6 other transactions were created and confirmed using the same inputs as your transaction.
"The coins they sent me" is a bit of a misnomer, as no coins were ever sent *to you* - the same coins were used in other transactions. Coins can never be copy/pasted they can only be moved, so your transaction became invalid the moment one of those inputs got confirmed in a block before this one in question.
If you know the sender, you can ask them to investigate and re-send the same amount you were expecting. If they are honest and competent it will not be an issue; the blockchain does not ever lie. 
If they are not......... then you are out of luck unfortunately

Hello there,
For any type of bitcoin buying &amp; selling in the state of NY, one of the parties involved needs to be licensed and complying with their stated AML policy. That is how it's been explained to us by our legal counsel.
Your example of circle.com is perfectly fine, since they do in fact have a BitLicense. Dealing with circle and other licensed online methods (like itBit or bitstamp or gemini) are great if you want to go from digital dollars to/from bitcoins. But for cold hard cash into/from bitcoins quickly &amp; on your own schedule......... that's when you would use one of our ATMs.
When it comes to buying and selling from ATMs, if you do it from **our** ATMs, then you are 100% fine, since we are above board and have our provisional licensure status. You can find a map of our ATM locations at our website here:  - however please note only 3 of the locations will also dispense cash, the rest are only for dispensing bitcoins. The locations that do both directions are the ones in the Vaporiums/Vape Stores.

Hmm good questions,
Just checked, and the daily limit is per-24 hour period, midnight-midnight. I believe it resets all the limits every midnight, Eastern Time. We do have some 24 hour locations also, so you can access the machines at your leisure! The store hours are also listed for each location on our website listed in the initial post.
Each ATM of ours has the same limit policy, yes. Currently, our AML policy for automatic limits on new customers is: for transactions up to $900 just your proper phone number is needed to trade. If you scan your ID with the machine, then it will grant you up to $2900 per day.
We can even manually raise the limits to any amount, however, that type of request requires our human compliance officer to review some verification docs/photos.
@_date: 2015-10-08 13:04:31
OP, you are instructing people to set the threshold erroneously too high.
I was guilty of this misnomer myself when first setting the value to 0.00016 (my thinking of 1 higher than his limit) on my nodes.
This is incorrect, and after doing some digging, then testing, the minrelaytxfee parameter works to prevent the mempool growth spam at even 0.00005 and I wager it would probably work at 0.00002 for this particular attack also.

It is all the more better for them if the block is empty because then global fees continue to spiral upward. 
They are making up the "lost" fees from an empty block with incredibly elevated fees from normal user transactions. 
.... like... If you have 20% of hashpower and get approx 20% of blocks, it means you also get 20% of the juiced up fees that the world is overpaying. 
So why should they care if it's an empty block here or there? They will take their empty block reward and have the knowledge that next actual block will give them the reward PLUS some extra fat fees from everyone. And as long as there is an artificial floor, all miners get more fees.

Hello there fellow New Yorker,
According to the state law passed few months ago regarding virtual currency, if you are trading **as a business** with a resident/business of the state of NY then yes, one party of the transaction needs to be registered/licensed and complying with their stated &amp; submitted AML policy.
*Some tips:*
* If you are getting your friend squared up over the dinner tab, no worries. No registration needed for that.
* If you are selling t-shirts/food/piano lessons/etc for bitcoin/digital currency, again, no worries there. The law has a carve-out for merchants accepting crypto as payment (you still need to report taxes obviously)
* But if it's cash, or something else similar to cash (like gift cards that are redeemable for cash) that you're trading for cryptos, that requires license because it's "money"
Please understand, we did not write the laws, we just follow them. This is how it has been explained to us by our legal counsel
All that being said, we are fully compliant and have registered with NYDFS, so if you wish to legally sell your bitcoins for cash **in NY**, we are happy to oblige!
@_date: 2017-07-08 08:45:57
 answer: No.
Long answer: No company (bitcoin or otherwise) can really enter into any type of "contract" or "binding agreement" directly with a minor exclusive of parental support.... so if you have "terms of service", as an operator/company, these are null/void and unenforceable with a minor, since you technically cannot form a legally binding agreement with such a person as they are not "of legal age" yet. Additionally, there are federal laws regarding children's informational data storage.
This is why basically all services (see Uber, Lyft, Square, Spotify, etc) stipulate the user must be at least 18.  
In the scope of bitcoin trading, this becomes extra problematic where the company must retain records for regulatory purposes, but then must also be able to delete the records of a minor if the parent/guardian wishes (which it is unable to do or be risking violation of KYC laws in its jurisdiction)  
The simplest solution is to prohibit minors from accessing the service as they cannot legally and knowingly agree to all the terms (which are actually very important for a company's own protection)
For more detailed reading, see [info on COPPA](
Also [here]( is an article explaining these legal aspects with regards to Uber/Lyft accounts.
@_date: 2017-05-12 02:07:27
I posted this explanation in another thread where they didn't understand what was going on with the fees; it is relevant here...  
A bitcoin transaction's mining fee has absolutely NOTHING to do with the dollar value or even the absolute amount of BTC.  It has everything to do with the amount of satoshis per byte size of the raw hex transaction. **that's it**
As this message is typed, there are currently 40 megs of transactions between 100-120 satoshis / byte.  And an additional 20 megs between 40-60 spb. Together just those groups of transactions are 2/3 of the global mempool, and equates to 600 blocks worth of transactions.  This is far beyond the amount of blocks needed to burn down that queue before any of those unconfirmed transactions would be scrubbed from memory pools (by default).
This causes all wallets with dynamic fee estimation to calculate a higher than needed amount for the mining fee. This behavior benefits **all** miners, as the entire mempool has elevated fees due to "whomever" made the floor at 100-120 spb.  Remember, when you want to demonize someone for this behavior, think: who benefits from an elevated, artificial fee floor? ... it's one group, and one group only: _miners_.
Most normal wallets use dynamic fee estimation which would not allow for their own sending transactions to get stuck, they would simply pay more to jump the queue.... Which is why everyone is complaining about high fees.

The height of the 'attack' saw the mempool of a full node running default settings grow to bit over a gig.
Simply increasing the minrelayfee from its default of 0.00001 to 0.00002 fixes the issue completely since this particular attack consisted of majority tx where fee = ~0.000015
Please note this manner of 'fixing' one's core node memory bloat is something anyone can do on their own at any time. It is not the value related to the fee required to get a miner to include the tx in a block, but instead the fee required for an operator's full node to even care about the tx in the first place. Either pass it along to rest of network connected p2p nodes, or ignore it when it first hears of it.
As to your question for sites with good statistics, the current ace that i know of is  (transactions dashboard)  And you already know of tradeblock, which is also awesome.

FWIW, we run multiple full nodes that stay connected 24/7 and have been working throughout the spam attacks perfectly fine with min relay fee set to either 0.00003 or 0.00002
All of the nodes' mempools, right now, are listing around 40mb. I feel that is pretty reasonable.
AFAIK the 'default' for this value if you do not set it (before any upgrade/patch, as it stands right now) is 0.00001

Wrong answer is wrong. *No offense..*
The mempool is mostly full of bullshit spam.
[Easy peasy to see]( when you look at it on a longer timescale.
The activity of the low fee transactions is **not** human. It is the result of a robotic script employed by a bad actor that wishes to impress the illusion of much more activity than there really is. The transactions spawn up linearly with regards to time and the events occur roughly on a 24hr interval cron job.
True economic transactions between users is nowhere near full capacity, strange as that may sound if you have not been monitoring the mempool constantly...
But hey, you bought into the bullshit, so cheers to the miners for their successful ruse! 
 well done, Jihan.

Hi Jeff,
Has there been any instances where private keys have been derived from solely the public key? It is my understanding with a sufficiently large keyspace (as bitcoin has) the attacks you are alluding to with ECC are all theoretical and revolve around possibly using a quantum computer (also still theoretical) to brute force the key... 
Are you implying one can derive the private key now, today, or are you future-proofing people? Please link me to some more info on how to do that... ya know... for science...

And again, as I stated after listening to them: it's understandable why he hung up because you were flying off the handle at something that was not his fault and were cursing, argumentative, rude, and belligerent to him. I'm happy to link the call audio here too if you wish to jog your memory on what exactly was said.  Not sure why you think I'm lying, other than lashing out for not being able to trade with us, and are upset at not getting your way?
Second: Details you sent in? The machine asked you for further information. You entered **incomplete** information. Example: you put down only 8 digits for a SSN, but valid SSN are 9 digits. And you did not list any other information that it asked for either. Furthermore, your ID also does not have a valid street address. PO Boxes do not count. 
You continue to call us names and speak rudely; it is clearly not your agenda to see the perspective of needing to operate within the legal framework in NY by providing correct ID. No matter how much you curse and scream, it does not change the fact you refused to provide the machine with a valid ID. Nothing we can do to change your chosen actions. 
AND your coins have already been refunded first thing in the AM to the address you specified by email, but you do not care to acknowledge this, you just want to vent about losing trade access. We are not obligated to trade with you, and by not providing us with the required information you are not adhering to the Terms of Service that you agreed to in order to use our service, so we must now refuse you this service.

What is this now? Lack of security protocol? Sorry, you got your refund and you're still complaining...? *sigh* Some people just want to watch the world burn... What you're doing is called **Gaslighting**, and it's very similar to tactics employed by schoolyard bullies and Donald Trump...
Spoofed emails? No one spoofed your email. The email you sent stated your phone number that was used in the machine &amp; that you also used to call support, the problem you were having, and the bitcoin address that you were requesting your funds returned. They were summarily returned...
You continue to spout off and make threats because we refunded your coins and are refusing you service. And I feel you're going to continue to post negatively about this because that is clearly your agenda. Nothing I can do to stop that. I cannot re-instate your account or change what was said on a support call. We did nothing wrong. You refused to provide information; we refused to provide service. You got your coins refunded back. It's rather simple. The only thing "scummy" here is that you continue to imply that this company did improper things, when it is in fact YOU who is and was acting very improperly and refused to answer any questions.
I did not lie about anything, when I posted about the disconnect it was prior to listening to the full call audio from the customer support logs. After listening to both calls, I corrected that statement in the next post and did not edit previous so all can see that I don't cover things up. That said, I still feel that the first support rep was berated by you for no fault of theirs and they are certainly not to be your punching bags. 
Also, I've repeatedly said on these posts if you had used proper ID in the first place this would not have been an issue. Compliance noticed your ID was invalid and then the machine asked you for more information. You didn't provide it. So it froze the trade. Then I had to manually refund it when I got to the office next morning. What is unclear about this situation? 
EVEN AFTER IT WAS FROZEN: Had you entered your proper information and not given only 8 digits of a SSN .....Guess what? It would've traded fine and you wouldn't be spouting off on reddit.... But you didn't do this. You chose to not simply answer the machine's questions and got angry expecting the world to bend around you and your threats - instead of understanding there are laws which we all must follow..... Then you make threats about some "moral duty" because we won't let you get your way to trade since you have refused to comply with our Terms of Service.... 
It's very childish what you're doing.... You had the power to fix your account freeze and let this all go through automatically on your own, but chose not to, instead to scream about the company rules and how you feel they shouldn't apply to you.

if the words came from the mouth of roger keith ver, there is a very high likelihood of those words being complete and utter FUD. [This]( is a rather accurate explanation of his behavior.
@_date: 2016-07-25 16:57:33
Customer Support has no control over account access... The decision to freeze the trade was made by Compliance, while you were trading, and as soon as it was noticed, because the ID and information you had just supplied was not able to be verified. Not a decision by Customer Support... 
No one hung up on you, sometimes the calls get disconnected, and in fact they did continue to keep trying to help you. Just because you were not allowed to trade by Compliance decision does not mean you should take your anger and frustration out on Customer Support. That is quite unfair to assume the people who answer phones have the power to over-ride Compliance - or to be your punching bag.  You also had the option to contact the Accounts department and clear it up by submitting proper ID, but you chose to "take it to the extreme" instead. 
Calling people names is childish... 
Again, you had an issue on Sunday which was rectified and refunded to you by Monday AM. If you think that's too long, then I don't know what to tell you. Less than 24hr on a weekend seems pretty good for response time...
@_date: 2017-07-15 00:02:30
Very true.
[It's sooo obvious!](
There are plenty of blocks that are not full, because the miners simply choose not to mine full blocks. It's their "right" and they can do this as they wish to keep driving the mempool fees up as they let the backlog continue, and the FUD spread.  
None of that small fee activity is "real" economic activity. The transactions spawn into existence in linear fashion with respect to time. That is the work of robots that belong to bad actors... not real users transacting with each other.
[Miners causing this with recent not-full blocks](
 data not fear

Not kidding, however after listening, I was wrong on the disconnect. I have now fully listened to the call recordings a few times over. He did hang up on you, because you were acting very belligerent to him for about 2 solid minutes... You were threatening and cursing at this first customer support rep because, like mentioned earlier, Customer Support has no power to control account issues and you just didn't care for the reasoning &amp; wanted to get your money ASAP - on a Sunday. 
Bottom line: The machine asked you for more info. **You refused to provide it**. So, it halted your trading ability. You didn't like this.
He advised you a few times to email the accounts department to rectify the issue - but this was not good enough for you. You "wanted it now" and got all bent out of shape on him. He doesn't make any decisions about any accounts and has no power to unfreeze accounts. He just answers phones and he was doing his best to advise you on how to most quickly clear up the issue. No one said anything about "a week to get back" except for you. You assumed that email response is "a week" which is flat out ridiculous. He rightfully said he doesn't know how long it takes for them to respond. He never said a week; you did. You accused him of stealing your money; he didn't touch your money. Again, this entire situation has been resolved within 24 hours. On a weekend no less.
All the while you continue to call us names and curse at us because we refunded your bitcoins and are refusing you trading service since the ID information you provided was inadequate for our legal compliance.  If you actually entered the information the machine asked for, and used proper ID in the machine, this would not have been an issue. 
Plenty of other people trade just fine on Sundays.
I'm very sorry you feel wronged, but we are required to have this information, and since you do not wish to provide it, we cannot trade with you.

Also very correct. # of transactions means jack shit, really. kB size is all that matters.
@_date: 2016-07-02 16:46:26
Sorry, but this is not a "simplified version of the current debate"
in fact, if one looks at the actual blocks being mined, and checks the tags the miners are including in these newly minted blocks, **only** KnCminer is for something other than core's stated roadmap. 
*Everyone else is doing what they were always doing.*
The "rumor" of "all the chinese miners" doing some "terminator" plan is absolute fabrication and, frankly, a crock of horse-shit to put it bluntly. 
The current debate is about a small but very vocal amount of people who are pushing their own agenda on social media and trying to stir up discussion. And, honestly, more power to them. This is similar to what advocacy groups do in politics. Just like the NRA. They have one singular task, and they do it rather well. Whether you agree or disagree with their respective stances, no one can argue they certainly get their message heard...
@_date: 2017-06-26 19:00:18
Sir/madame, I did not make any complaints. I merely pointed out observations that the typical estimations currently available to end users tend to be unnecessarily high...  I personally have coded my own proprietary logic for fee calculation that commands my core node to properly adjust to an ever-changing mempool.  It works *very* well for my specific use case, and simultaneously saves me tons of money due to the increased efficiency of the calculation. All the while my recipients get very quick confirms &amp; I don't pay a satoshi more than is needed... 
Furthermore, I don't know what you think I implied, but "yeoman's work" is synonymous with "efficient or useful help in need", as in: I have much respect for his contributions because they are a much needed efficiency boost to the fee algorithms. I did not call him anything. Kindly re-read my post with this phrase's meaning in mind... Also, the PR is an overall good thing because it improves upon existing stock behavior, and does indeed offer more granular control. 
However, my original point still remains: one cannot predict the future 100% and there's not much that can be done pre-emptively to combat that variance with an initial calculation alone... 
@_date: 2017-06-26 13:08:49
Yes, I've been following this PR.. Alex does some yeoman's work with the fee algorithms... Still, however, most typical bad user experience is not about getting an accurate transaction confirm estimate over such long timeframes like 1008 blocks.... People have rather short attention spans &amp; typically want to get their tx confirmed as soon as possible.
Still going to stick with occam's razor &amp; say the simplest calculation of drilling down from the top is most ideal &amp; even then, isn't a full 100% guarantee due to future variance &amp; probability. Which will always be the case....
If something get's "stuck" you better hope your recipient didn't spend unconfirmed funds, otherwise you cannot "unstick" it with an RBF fee bump.
95% predictions are great &amp; all..... unless your tx is part of the 5% statistic that gets missed...
@_date: 2017-06-25 14:52:19
Hi there OP,
Something you should know about "fee estimation"
 all bullshit
... reason being... one can *never* tell precisely when the next block will be found, and how many transactions/kb size it will eat up from the mempool. Or even how many **new** transactions will sprout forth in the time since you sent your tx and a block being found, so those "unknown unknowns" will adversely affect your confirm wait time and are impossible to accurately predict.
The simple solution is to NOT try and predict what is impossible to predict, and instead just calculate what fees would be optimal for getting a new transaction into the very next block or two. That's about all you can do for "prediction" and it doesn't add extra "fluff" in the mempool, which just goes to lining the pockets of the miners for no f*ing good reason.
Judging what is or is not "low fee" based on what just got mined is a fallacy. Typical miner behavior is to drill down the mempool from highest satoshi per byte to lowest (with a few caveats for like CPFP transactions) but for the most part, this is how the vast majority of miners behave &amp; my observations of the mempool match this hypothesis.
Services think they are being fancy by trying to do heuristics but the truth is that the future is probability and variance... there is no guarantee a new block will be found in 1 min 10 min or 1 hour.
That's just how bitcoin works...  
core and 21co both grossly overestimate the fees, because they would rather have their users get confirmed quick &amp; the user is usually not knowledgeable enough to care about paying too much, they just don't want to get their tx "stuck"
FWIW: as this post is typed, the mempool is about 30mb in size, with 85% of that size below 20 satoshi per byte.... with a "next block guarantee" of, currently, about 200 satoshi per byte. but nevertheless, 21co is saying it's 330 SPB and core default is more like 350..
@_date: 2017-06-23 03:16:55
This is very very correct.
We employ custom proprietary fee logic for our own kiosk network. It works *very* well... Granted - up until a point.... Crucially, the only thing it can't predict for is the future (kinda obvious, but still worth saying)
No matter how good any fee "prediction" is - you cannot predict when the next block will or won't get found (like, for an hour or more) and then a dearth of transactions come in ahead of yours during this drought causing backlog....  
If your recipient of the unconfirmed bitcoins goes ahead and spends them without waiting for confirm, you can only then hope they spent that child transaction with a heavy fee to unstick the two of them.... otherwise, they wait.
Such is life...
FWIW: Right now, our logic is predicting 41 satoshi per byte as the most optimal fee..... and all the tx are getting confirmed in the very next block or two.
Also, FWIW: we monitor the mempool constantly, and are quite certain there are either bad actors spamming with large kb size and high fee all at once, so clearly from a single "entity", or really REALLY shitty algorithms in wallet software that exacerbates the phenomenon enormously. 
 paying too high a fee does is line the pockets of miners for _no good reason._
@_date: 2017-06-24 13:48:21
not sure what OP is doing... maybe using bitcoin inefficiently and also during times of high simultaneous usage, when everyone else in the world is also using it and causing competition for fees?
I can tell you **right now**, as this post is typed, typical fees are on the order of like twelve cents USD value.
Example:: Here's one of my company's tx from earlier this morning: 
already whole slew of confirms.... 
Perhaps the problem exists with the OP and the OP's wallet or behavior?
@_date: 2016-07-25 16:26:07
Normally we don't respond publicly, but OP was cursing and screaming at my customer support reps, who are nice people just trying to help out and answer questions. We feel it necessary to let people know that yelling and acting aggressively will get you nowhere. We are a regulated entity that must comply with NY law. You were asked for proper ID and refused to provide it. Therefore, we sadly cannot offer trading services to you. We didn't write the law, but we are still required to follow it, because... well... it's the law! It's unfortunate you think that this is targeted specifically towards you. It is not. 
For the record, OP: your bitcoin that you had attempted to convert to cash were returned to your requested address first thing Monday AM. This issue occurred on a Sunday afternoon/evening, and there's no one in the office at that time to process refunds. 
We respect people's privacy, so will refrain from posting the txid or address publicly, but you can check your wallet at any time to see the coins are there.
All the best,

Actually, no - that's not true at all. the machines charge much less than that. You can always check our live rates on coinatmradar.  The machine OP was at: 
The machines are tiered pricing. $500 and over is 12%... For trades $2000 and over it's actually just 8% above global average.... This is pretty competitive and cheap for the (usually) 24hr convenience of walking up to a machine in your neighborhood and putting in cash for bitcoins at your leisure. 
Also, for the record, OP was selling bitcoins to our machines, which are actually the best rates in the entire area. It is nearly an even-money conversion at just 1.5-2% off the global average price. This is 2x as good as the next closest competitor who charges over 3% for cashing out coins!
