Oh damn I'm looking at the Coinbase stock prices 
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:31:17
Ok so what's the lowest I can pay for a fraction of a bitcoin? And if the bitcoin price goes higher I will be getting a profit right and if bitcoin prices really low will I lose the bitcoin like is that a possibility?

What would you recommend I buy lite,bit or ethereum?

Ok so let's say I buy $5 worth of bitcoin and the value of bitcoin go higher will those $5 be worth more?

I plan on selling my bitcoin from coinbase does anybody know if it will reach my bank account faster now that the new transfer thing came out?

What about other cryptocurrency? 
I’m not mining for the sake of profit but just for holding a large amount of coins  
The only reason I chose to mine bitcoin was because it had guides that weren’t outdated
Do you know any coins that can be mined easily
@_date: 2019-09-28 20:39:05
I downloaded bitcoin core from bitcoin.org 
Is this a good wallet?
I also wanted to start mining so I followed a guide that led me to using nicehash is that a good miner?
@_date: 2019-09-28 21:20:08
Is that a no to bitcoin core or NiceHash?
