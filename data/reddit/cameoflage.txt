I understand that decentralization is important but to be honest, I couldn’t explain to someone why, exactly.
If someone wanted to come up with basically a script for a video to explain  why it’s so important I would love to animate it. I made a short video about surface level basics of Bitcoin and want to do more videos to spread the word about how life changing blockchain could be.
Here’s the video I made: [What is Bitcoin?](

Haha, I mean did he say anything idiotic in the video? He warns of the possibility of a crash but I didn’t get the feeling that he’s painting it in a negative light.

That’s a good way to live your life.

I’ll look that up tomorrow. Thanks!

Glad I posted my noon question cause I just learned about mBTC, satoshi, etc. Really cool.
And thank you! I’m hoping to be able to buy small amounts on a regular basis in which case I’ll need to learn some things I imagine.

Truth. I also like being able to say I own 95,000 satoshi a lot more than $100 of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:54:34
I did not know about satoshi. I like that.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:00:36
That makes sense. So $100 right now is like, 1,000,000 satoshi?
Or am I doing that math completely wrong?

Always got the same advice from my family growing up. I’m happy to have even a few hundred dollars I can afford to lose now.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:25:56
Awesome, thanks for the advice!
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:27:26
Ah ok. So I was only off by 900,000.

Oh really? Why is that? How technically savvy does one need to be to store elsewhere?
