no one is forced to trust them. No one is forcing you to hold USDT. if you trust it you use it if not you dont. its very simple.
this flamewar against tether is so annoying

what did you expect how the atm would make money and be paid for? 
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:07:29
well at least we are paying at least 50% or more tax to the  government and with this the government provides housing and food  for the poor people.
In germany the poor get a own apartment and about 600 usd per month to spent (+ free health insurance)
we pay a high tax for it, but everyone helps everyone else.
meanwhile in india the people life in their $80,000 us dollar apartments (pune, baner, hinjawadi, for example) while next door the poor life in a iron sheet and beg for food.
how can people be so selfish
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:26:27
it is written in my original posting. usd converted to bitcoin at bitstamp rate on day of payment

ok you could be a orthodox jew as well. sorry for my assumptions
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:16:50
yeah google craig wright.
you can also google falkvinge who also is in the bitcoin cash gang (joger ver, jihan wu, craig wright)
falkvinge wanted to legalize child porn  when he was a politicna
jihan wu owns bitmain and  is the founder of bcash and is pumping + promoting it. because segwit destroyed his business concept
googel asicboost segwit
they also bought  several websites und domains to promote bcash but they are all a bunch of liar.
roger ver made in 2013? the youtube video were he was at mtgox and confirmed that they  are solvent and that he saw all the money and coins.
all of them are scammers, promoting a scam coin

why would you pay 100$ for it? Just double spent the same transaction again and pay  a 5$ tx feeß fees are low right now
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:38:08
Iam sending all the withdrawals back to gdax with a  total fee of 3$
thats worth it for me. i will continue costing them money
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:51:19
this could also be all bitstamp deposits for example. they accept segwit deposits
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:06:16
Yes social engineering. right now all the noobs/new users are getting filled with lies and misinformation in order to make them love bcash.
bitcoin isnt spending any money for propaganda but bcash is, so of course bcash is winning in the short term
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:03:12

Maybe you should go and ask  coinbase for a audit?I think they run on a federal reserve system

bitcoin cash is a scam. better buy bitcoin
you know craig wright? he claimed to be satoshi and he is in bitcoin cash.. (of course he isnt sattoshi)but craig is a sick liar

"his is where it gets interesting. In 2011 Dan Kaminsky, a leading Internet-security researcher, investigated the currency and was sure he would find major weaknesses. After he studied the code, he found 9 possible ways to compromise the system, but every single time he started his attack the system would return the following message to him: attack removed. He said that the creator of Bitcoin had to have superhuman programming skills."
so where are the github changes ?
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:20:55
" you just need to edit the key derivation path (change 44 to 49) as you set it up"
Maybe you give a step by step manual for  low level users like me? "Just editing" sounds so easy...
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:04:24
because bitcoin users are not here to make money but rather to support a new great idea.

maybe joger ver and jihan wu stopped the spamming machine? I heard the spam machine is really expensive to keep it running for alonger time
on the "all" view you can clearly see how they turn it on and off from time to time

the united nation has the world food programme running. They dont waste their money on advertisment. thats why nobody knows about it.
if you donate to them it will do the best. because they dont use 50% of the donations for salaries or advertisment.
they spent everything directly where it is needed, at countries with massive hungeer
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:47:17
their subreddit   has 590 abonnents. And you seriously think they are not a scam? with 500 customers?lol
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:50:47
the hasrate increased immense in the last day. we have up to 10 blocks per hour sometimes. thats why we process transactions  faster.

You only know 5% of  btc. there is 95% of more bad things about it.
it is owned and mined by jihan vu (bitmain) and basically no other uses it.
BCH is attracting noobs that has no clue about bitcoins. everyone else is ignoring it

Why are they speaking german in the video?
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:44:08
why would anyone use this exchange? I never heard of this name before. Why not use established exchanges like bitstamp for example? they deal in euro
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:28:23
you can still redeem the full bitcoin cash. get a light client like electrum cash for example
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:46:38
is it a exchange or only a wallet?
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:46:50
you must be stupid. electricity is very expensive in germany and no one can deny it.
miners dont get a discount there
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:17:23
35% is nothing
in other countries they take 35-50% from your salary
and then when you go into a store to buy something they take another 15-20% VAT
so total is 55-70% taxes.
even more if you buy fuel in europe for exampe. gas/petro/diesel has 80% tax
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:28:17
No you can prove that you are satoshi by signing a message with his pivate key.
he claimed to have signed a message but it turned out that it was fake! so this is how they found it. 
he provided a signed message and it was fake
@_date: 2018-01-23 01:45:33
then just double spent the coins and sent them to your own adress? fuck the merchant. you keep the coins and can spent them on  another merchant
the bitpie or bither android app offers a paid accelerator service that should work

you dont get this as a endconsumer however and miners are endconsumers.
 in fact the users are paying a higher price per kwh because of the excess power
@_date: 2018-01-28 04:46:26
jihan vu and joger vers spam bots stopped as it was to expensive to keep the spamming up for  a long period. this was not the first spam attack we saw.
 you can see it very clearly when you chose the "all" view

Well every full node gets compensated. Usually full nodes are also having some bitcoins in their wallets, and with more full nodes the  value of each bitcoin grows. We  wouldnt be at 11,000 otherwise now

Bitcoin is still in a beta or alpha phase. It is still in development. What do you expect? Of course it has bugs and flaws  but what is more important:
IT MISSES MANY FEATURES
and as soon as these features come to the market a lot of problems will vanish (blockspace)
If we still have blockspace problems in 5 years we can still increase the blocksize, but right now it is stupid to increase the blocksize

blocks can hold  transactions size of up to 4 mb right now

it is the amount of bytes the block would have if it didnt use segwit. so basically this 2mb block stores tx that would require 4 mb in a non segwit block

Well I think bitcoin is still in its baby phase. maybe less then 0,1% know about it or use it. It still has massive growth
there can always never be more then 21 million bitcoins. Now imagine how many people are on the world.

You have a misunderstanding, there is no "core"  and also not 1 developer team that as like a to do list by years.
Everyone can submit a change on their github repo and it gets into the next release.
So if you decide today to work on schnorr and make the changes in github it would be live in a few days/weeks (assuming you are that fast in developing and not having any bugs)

Changing the algorithm would not help at  all. Bitcoin would be dead then.
What happens after you change the algorithm? You still have to give the old users access to their coins. so how do you do it? With  the private key ? Well the sha cracker now has the same private key as the old users, so who do you give the coins?

we dont need a fork to reduce the base reward per block. bitcoin as a so called halving that halves the reward every 4 years.
mining will get more and more unprofitable and investments are going to stop. people will then mine for nonprofit just to support the decentralized aspect

I think families making less then 30k a year and having 2 children dont have any money to invest into bitcoin. they are probably in debt.
@_date: 2018-03-04 18:52:36
Well dont be sad. If you had a house fire or something else  your coins would  also be  gone forever, since you never had a real backup....
A real backup should be fireproof or in a  different location

If you get paid in bitcoin and you sell them every week or month that is okay.
@_date: 2018-02-12 22:46:48
but why would a millionaire invest 100% of his money into bitcoin?

such a bullshit.

coinb.in  can do it and the website is legit
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:09:45
I would mine even if I dont make any money just because I like to be an enthusiast and to support bitcoin. I think many people have the same thoughts as me. It would actually help bitcoin if you cant get rich quick with mining
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:32:28
I think you dont understand  bitcoin. The worst case scenario is not that he cant spent the 1 sat but everything else aswell, as you cant sent 1 sat alone but you also have change that will be unconfirmed

bitcoin going to 1 million usd soon

4 million
@_date: 2018-03-05 13:23:16
this guy bought $1.5 million and bought/sold it to cash for customers for a commission.   Thats clearly a business and cant be done illegal.
Its a total different story if he just sold his own private coins he owned..  but he did it for the comission
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:14:10
what is your transaction id? did  you sent coins or receive them?
If you sent coins and they have 0 confirmations so far you can just make a  double spent and sent the same coins again with a higher fee somewhere else.
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:02:03
the risk of going there is that you could get brainwashed

Your idea of going all in sounds great.  However I want you to only invest in Bitcoin and not some other shady coin. All coins are tied to the value of bitcoin. When bitcoin goes down they go down to  and when bitcoin goes up they go down too because everyone wants to board the bitcoin ship.
just buy bicoins and keep working for 2-3 more years. then you will have reached your moon

Did you forget about the 200k coins when you declared bankruptcy?
If you would've found the 200k coins before declaring bankruptcy would you than kept the exchange running in hope to making the other coins back?
Or where the withdraw request already higher than 200k coins ?

Bitcoin has the most developers and the most upcoming projects additions.
The best currency is a currency that has everything (storage of value, instant payments, smart contracts)
Ethereum can do smart contract but bitcoin cant. But bitcoin is getting so many additional layers that it will also be able to handle smart contracts.
So basically with a few more years of development bitcoin alone can do everything what each other currencie has a feature..
also instant and  anonymous payments are soon perfectly possible with lightning network.
the winning currency will be the one with the most features and functionalities

Maybe he exchanged some coins through bitcoin builder? because the 3.5 million are not 12k coins.
@_date: 2018-04-08 11:55:30
well they sold a lot of miners during the last bubble. these might slowly get shipped/arrive now to the customers
@_date: 2018-04-04 11:50:48
maybe you should stop listening to this reddit and listen to your stomach feeling (sell the coins)
buy back later. So far everytime the bubble "popped" it there was at least a 2 year depressive phase where it goes lower and lower before it rises again
7000 is still very high and maybe overvalued. Imagine all the people  that only invested 10,000 usd @ 250 USD 2 years ago can still sell now and have  350,000 USD now.. so now you know how many people might still sell now  and their money.
@_date: 2018-04-03 21:07:49
No. some altcoins say they have some  benefits like smart contracts  for example. However all these features will come to bitcoin to.( a lot of stuff is in development with sidechains)
bitcoin has the biggest potential. Bitcoin is lik a embryo thats still in the mother and starting to grow now

I just check the creditor list and he is inthere
335126397 JPY and 
385117 US Dollar
total = 3.545.358 so roundabout 3.5 million USD
@_date: 2018-04-04 10:18:00






you can look in the creditor list if he is listed there. if no than he got his coins because otherwise he wouldve claimed  it in the bankruptcy and be in the list
@_date: 2018-04-04 10:27:08
Joger Ver is a creditor with only 577 BTC so I think at least he got the chance to withdraw the coins from the exchange

oh boy i just called the fbi

If mtgox enters civil rehabilitation, it means that the company would than pay out the remaining 160k bitcoin.
Would YOU or the rehabilitated company than try to run the exchange again? A lot of creditors would probably like that if they get as a gift part ownership of the exchange and maybe a small extra return over the next 10-30 years?
They could also sell their share of ownership to investors
Please do that
How many million USDollar would it cost as a investment to start the exchange running again? Maybe money for that will be found
@_date: 2018-04-08 14:44:44
well  now roger has to buy it again
@_date: 2018-04-04 10:48:37
Did you ever consider to create your own new cryptocurrency ? call them goxcoins and give every creditor a 1:1 distribution :maybe that coin will go off sometime :) and maybe that coin can be exchanged for shares /ownership of a exchange

dude this is a fucking government agency. You dont think that they have a photo of you, size and  depending on eu country also a fingerprint.
What else happens if your passport gets lost while traveling?! since you are a citizen of country x, country x cannot deny to give you a passport.
I personally own 2 passports (germany) because I told them that I needed 2 for traveling to make complicated things easy. Easy done and I own 2 of them now
