The mechanics are more or less the same everytime, whales start moving into ALTs, make the difference, a bunch of people follow them, when they're satisfied, they come back to BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:16:35
It's not panic, it's a call for action. Drop all these wallets and exchanges that will not implement Segwit, and when they start losing thusands of users, suddenly they will realize they have to work on it fast. As usual, real power rests on the very users.
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:40:15
If the only reason people is buying the bank token is because the misleading 'cheap' point of view, then we diserve the whole system go to shit and never recover. I'll mean an instant faith in humanity lost situation.
How is that even possible that a centralized bank premined token could do any harm to Bitcoin? The whole thing is fishy as hell.

Where's the market response?
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:55:00
These times are over. Bitcoin became a mere entry point to speculate with ALTs. In part thanks to the fees.

@_date: 2018-01-03 17:51:33
ConBase doesn't implement Segwit? Simply GO AWAY and close your account.
Now replicate the same with every non-Segwit wallet and exchange service.
But Jesus Christ, do it already. How ConBase is STILL fully functional is beyond me.
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:07:13
There's no "on chain" scaling possible with blockchains. It's just impossible if you want to mantain descentralization.

Amazing discussion, we need more of this here. Specially with the recent rise of banking tokens, for instance.
@_date: 2018-01-04 21:07:01

I don't think btrash going down and this token going up is a coincidence though...
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:20:28
Ethereum went Up 8000% in a year. Bitcoin is stuck un price, 1300% in a year, and -4% in a whole month. This is not looking good. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:13:12
Eventually, the developers plan to scale RSK orders of magnitude further. “As part of RSK roadmap, parallel processing of smart contracts, full node incentives and transaction compression will provide an additional increase of up to 2,000 transactions per second,” Zaldivar explained. “Those improvements combined with Lumino off-chain technology built by the RSK team will enable processing of more than 20,000 transactions per second.”
Holly fucking shit.

This idiot is a fucking joke. OMG just drop the fucking ConBase already, move to another Segwit exchange ASAP.
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:18:23
20 days, moved from 0.2 to 3.1
If you were to project the same for Bitcoin, it would mean that Bitcoin there should be around 186.000, with a starting point on 12.000.
It's just impossible what's happening with that token. This is EXTREMELY manipulated.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:20:53
And yet... the market doesn't care.
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:05:33
Centralized exchanges, the irony...
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:40:17
and while teh devs "take time", a centralized banks token went to the moon because "it's free, it's cheap, banks love it!".
The exchanges allowed the trojan horse, now it's a big problem.
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:00:51
Anonimity makes perfect sense for this "person" or "group", if not, they will rapidly be targeted, think about what happened to that guy from the UK exchange.

Now go back to be a good sheeple.
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:04:22
Btrash is falling hard, for the first time really separating from Bitcoin trends, JUST when the Ripplemania started.
Yeah, that doesn't look suspicious at all.
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:44:27
People, Bitcoin price will be more stable than ever, these times is only used as an entry point for ALTs speculation for some and store of value for others.
This happens in part because the inability of Bitcoin to work as a cheap payment system.
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:43:47
OP what did you grasp regarding Segwit implementation?
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:57:37
Three services you need to drop ASAP:
1) Coinbase
2) BitPay
3) Blockchain.info
You already have plenty of options, there's NO excuse.
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:01:31
Its a bank token now apparently. Premined, centralized.
And the idiots are buying it.
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:41:53
It depends, are you talking about present time, or future times?
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:47:28
If nothing is done, Bitcoin has no use beyond "digital gold". Heck, I believe not even that. Even a bank token seems to be a good competitor these times.
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:52:06
They were all in with Segwit2x, when it went to trash, they just started to silently boycott Segwit. All people should drop that fucking piece of shit exchange.
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:38:04
Maybe because the main players, big exchanges, wont adopt It? So, its rather very simple: drop these wallets and exchanges and move to the ones using Segwit.
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:02:20
Basically he's giving away 5 BTC, if true he must have several times that. Lucky bastard!
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:20:28
Can ETH continue being relevant?
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:59:38
I'm just mentioning because it's the same kind of attack they use with Bitcoin aswell. Please, who would ever dump ETH for BCH at those levels, makes no sense.
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:45:26
And in the meantime, Bitcoin does... nothing. And the bank token keeps rising.
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:24:53
Other coins can do that... with how much transaction volume exactly?
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:26:40
So we just drop Bitcoin then? Because ALTs are literally killing Bitcoin right now, mainly because 2 reason, Bitcoin high fees and pure speculation with "cheap" ALTs.
@_date: 2018-01-03 14:41:20
THIS how can this be done? Something has to change, people STILL believes "oh noes Bitcoin 15k pretty expensive let's buy something else" It doesn't help at all!
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:54:25
Too late, the "ripplening" it's over, now it seems we're on round 2 for "etherning" for some reason, sigh.

Where are these tokens being sold? I dont see them at Coinmarketcap.
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:19:47
The only thing can help is to massively convince people to drop Coinbase, it will force the company to implement Segwit in order to avoid losing tons of clients.
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:36:25
You forget that because exchanges, you can SWITCH from BTC to these centralized "alts" that, like Ripple, are basically the tojan horse from banksters.

He's a fraud. There are no time travelers.

Why? Litecoin is way better. Bcash has no long term scaling solutions besides increasing block size, with leads to centralization. Makes no sense.

Add the constant issues with the "poorly" regulated exchanges, and you have a timebomb.
Regarding Lightning, I completely agree, but we already have Segwit and no everyone is using it, for instance, Coinbase. Four months since Segwit activated but for these guys, it's "not a priority".

Increasing block size is a short time solution and worse, it aims to centralization. The second layer Lightning Network approach makes a lot of more sense, it solves fees and transaction times and basically render useless a lot of altcoin, including Bcash.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:14:29
Oh I see, so basically Bitcoin price completely unpredictable as usual lol

@_date: 2017-12-09 19:00:51
Regarding to 3) I think since it's an open protocol, always can be updated/improved, so the others projects must be really different in order to survive long term and eventually flourish. And since Bitcoin is the most "popular" and can be improved, there's no real sense to "switch" massively to another coin.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:41:54
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:55:44
Segwit implementation will solve greatly the current problems. You can help dropping wallets/exchanges that refuse to use it.

@_date: 2017-12-06 22:11:39
I implore you to inform yourself properly. Even the Tether company afirms in their website that the 1:1 doesn't mean it's actually backed in US dollars. And that's just one bit of all it.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:10:28
Around Dec 17-18 a lot of people migrated to some ALTs. Take a look at Verge, for instance. This is a gamble, going from BTC to ALTs and viceversa. that combined with the stupid fees and transaction times makes the things a lot worse.
Segwit should have been a hardfork, now we have these problem because of that. Since the exchanges don't give a fuck about the network fees, they never migrated to Segwit. I mean, adoption around 10% after months, that's a complete failure.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:33:26
Sigh not this shit again, listen to me troll, nobody gives a fuck about these fees, nobody should be wasting any BTC for that matter, it's a deflationary coin, do you even know what it is? As worst, you could be cashing out thousands worth of bitcoin to buy a car or some expensive objetcs/materials and by then you will give a flying fuck about the $20 fees. Sigh how many threads these btrash lovers are going to make on this forum?

Ha! Speaking about brutal honesty. I wonder how many criticism on the MSM comes because they didn't get on the boat a year ago.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:00:54
Sell all their fucking shit and dump It to zero. Ver and Amstrong are attacking Bitcoin on purpose, they used the difficulty change yo suddently make the attack. This is enough, sell all the bcrap to zero NOW and all leave Coinbase NOW
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:37:04
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:25:35
Eventually yes, not tonight. It must correct.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:04:14
You have it, it's called Segwit and CONBASE refuses to implement it.
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:47:37
oki doki
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:59:40
Btrash isn't competition, is a scam coin, with people colluding and attacking the Bitcoin network, misleading and manipulatin artifically markets. Once the selling is ready in ConBase, drop it into oblivion once for all.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:04:04
You're short, since you're taking 2015 as point of origin. You should've taken Jan 2017, for instance.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:35:19
No, the correction just arrived.
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:15:02
Cashing out lol
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:42:21
Apparently a so called centralized token asociated with banks is the main responsible... sigh
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:45:57
The whole thing is a big charade, with this and the Tether fraud were facing a complete meltdown of the entire ecosystem, including the shitty bcash altcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:44:19
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:04:05
Indeed. Was completely expected.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:54:49
1 million before 2018 ends.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:08:33
The Tether manipulation could be a problem and eventually make cryptos crash.
The futures also could be a problem apparently if big whales start shorting.
I think these are the two main menaces so far.
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:22:11
Yeah well I present you the reality. It's not enough.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:39:41
Destroy btrash, sell It all, switch to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:37:07
Bitcoin can still grow from x100 to x1000 in the next years, I understand the point of the video but truth is you need to look at least anual charts of growth on the let's says top 20 cryptos and compare. Sometimes they pump a lot like recently with Iota, but sometimes will do the opposite.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:18:31
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:26:46
It's just not practical to send such low amounts right now, Lightning will solve these issues.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:03:41
Sure, 1700% pump in a year, but Bitcoin is dead.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:41:07
Why weird? A few whales have a lot of BTC, they manipulate the price as they want.
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:15:52
Extraordinary article.
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:24:10
They don't care about your complains, they only will act when they start losing clients because of this lack of implementation. After a proper complain, you should inform them you're droping their services because the lack of Segwit.
Take a look here:
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:34:59
You could be multiplying your funds on a 100x factor un 2-4 years, so yeah.
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:18:38
Whats the incentive? Easy as that, that's why people wont run full nodes.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:58:46
Who would be wasting BTC on regular small buys considering the jump in price registered during this year? I'll understand people cashing out to buy a car or such, but come on, it's a deflationary currency!
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:30:59
Why yo switch to Bcash having Litecoin ir Dash?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:27:14
This is game over for the shitcoin, and also, remember dropping ConBase for good once you traded all your free shitcoins into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:03:54
You should donate to the halfers, you know, people that never can round up to 1 entire BTC and always having a fraction lol.
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:45:09
The article ends stating that the source gives a 11.500 per Bitcoin at mid 2018. Lol.
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:03:38
And here comes the correction.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:23:10
Correction will come eventually. Anyway, it went up 65% in a month. If it were to mantain this ratio, you could expect the 1 million BTC by September 2018.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:02:28
Move to Gemini, whatever you like, its time to deadly injure Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:39:57
Steam just dropped BTC as payment method. LN is required to drastically reduce the fees problem, then Amazon could consider adding it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:48:09
Yes about the 200k, not about the other part.
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:54:27
Coinbase and similar exchanges have the key to really making a improvement on this area. Talking and asking doesn't work with these guys, they only understand money, so I say, drop Coinbase and other exchanges that refuse to implement Segwit. When they start losing tons of users, they will rapidly implement the necessary changes.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:41:59
20k and will correct, stay around 17.5-19 a couple of days, and again over 20k but this time steady.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:19:13
Pure maths folks, pure maths.
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:37:10
lol great site.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:54:22
The fucking scammer is pumping his shitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:09:43
No its not and second layer applications will boost its value to Heaven.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:54:23
Network effect. Boo bye.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:37:21
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:12:42
People putting money on banks coin?
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:46:36
WoW 250 coins, sigh, and i'm here fighting to reach a full one. Thanks for the depression pump.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:17:40
Lightning will solve it, but you already knew that, right troll?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:02:14
Gonna correct eventually. It always does.
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:34:27
Excelent interview and insights.
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:42:43
This thing will blow up eventually. Make my words. This is not good for the Bitcoin ecosystem.
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:50:52
Here we go again...
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:41:29
Bitcoin reaches $10, is a bubble, bitcoin reaches $100, is a bubble, bitcoin reaches $1000, is a bubble,  bitcoin reaches $10000, is a bubble...
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:13:03
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:21:21
Start looking here:
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:36:42
Whales having fun, market manipulation.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:03:04
regarding to 2), Lighting Network will allow almost real time transactions and zero fees between partners, using payment channel off-chain, and the balance eventually is put on-chain.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:17:51
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:22:51
No, drop expected. It cannot sustain this growth for much longer.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:04:56
artifically moved by the Ver squad and himself to not let die his shitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:14:30
If the Tether fraud doesn't blow up, I'll call it conservative. Bitcopin price went up by 65% in a month, do the math if the behavior replicates.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:02:06
Well you have to also consider the CEO trashminers clogging the network on purpose.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:38:55
Actually all the coins are doing the same.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:15:02
You want lower fees and rapid confirmations, you have plenty altcoins to choose that NOT pretend to be Bitcoin, trying to steal the name, trying to artificially pump the value, trying to destroy Bitcoin network with blatant and consistent attacks, trying to collute with ConBase and CNBC to confuse and manipulate people and markets. I say it again: DESTROY IT.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:09:24
He claimed Bitcoin at $1000 in 2015, never happened. FAIL. Next?
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:03:26
Download electrum wallet and move them there.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:02:27
DUMP IT ALL!
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:03:35
Fud is strong on this one
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:04:23
Regarding to 1) for all I read/watched, it seems that short term, could be a lot of volatility, but eventually it will settle, and volume should increase notably.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:10:10
Innecesary, eventually LN is deployed and it will solve all that.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:59:50
It's delayed since the scammer shitcoin CEO is artificially pumping his btrash.
@_date: 2019-11-02 16:28:04
Argentina here.
Yes, indeed this happened. As usual, governments going against their citizens when their privilegies are being compromised.
You can just purchase 200USD every month. This already happened 10 years ago.
This country is just a leftist shithole.
The Peso is the coin you're forced to use, and since there's around 60% anual inflation, your savings just get crushed.
President Macri was a complete disappoinment, he just followed more or less the same economic path that the leftists before, worsing the situation with debt, and now he lost the re election, paving the way to the guys that destroyed the economy during the previous decades.
This is just insanity. We're rapidly becoming Venezuela 2.0.
@_date: 2019-08-12 20:06:20
I'm argentinian. This is madness. Current government did almost everything wrong, inflation rates and poverty levels are worse than 4 years ago. A golden change opportunity gone.
And people just voted for a "communist" alternative that have proven before to be a complete disaster. This is justa  primary election, real election comes in October, but difference is around 15%.
Pray for us. Venezuela 2.0 is coming.
@_date: 2019-08-13 04:45:18
It got a pretty active community.
@_date: 2019-10-11 00:25:38
It could take a year or more after halving to reach prices around 100k.
Look at previous halvings.
@_date: 2019-10-25 20:06:25
Bold. Any more details?
@_date: 2019-10-25 20:08:49
@_date: 2019-10-21 18:48:52
No, if STF works, price around 55k is expected at least 1 year after halving.
@_date: 2019-06-30 05:40:30
Yeah well there's something called money demand. It's not that easy.
@_date: 2019-10-13 21:01:52
Certainly around 2021
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:26:41
Two months? Think before new year.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:06:12
It shows two things, decentralization doesnt exists and worse yet, this level of instability wont ever help bitcoin to become mainstream and help into adoption.
The whole thing is a joke.
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:32:15
Hope in humanity restored, right? Such a nice gesture. Who knows, that amount could make you a millonaire in some years. Crazy times. I mined half BTC in 2014, it took me about 6 months and that's it, my PSU blew up lol, so I stopped. I mined during one month in Nicehash just 0.01 BTC :(, but warm season is starting here so I had to stop. I'll wait until BTC reachs 1 million price, yeah, I know, maybe I have to wait for a long time... maybe it never happens.
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:13:40
So, BTC replaces USD for global commodities trading but under 10k per coin. Nice try... oh, wait, not even close.
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:09:04
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:42:53
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:22:28
Makes sense. Perfectly possible.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:47:22
BCH remained as shitty altcoin for months, all of the sudden is the best thing ever happened. Wtf is this. We're puppets, the so called decentralization is a joke. We're slaves of the middle man: the miners.
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:08:02
China banning BTC but alowing bch and neo.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:54:40
Completely possible, and it could be close to the 100k.
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:39:17
I mean, BTC price goes UP just when Theter market cap goes UP.
Does it sounds like printing money from thin air or it's just me?
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:52:22
Wow that escalated quicky.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:13:56
Maybe the drop had something to do with this?
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:23:09
Old link, Buzz un Twitter now is that they're only banning BTC but allowing BCH
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:20:50
Man I wish I had a time machine, I'm now every day watching the price going up and up. It's very difficult here in Argentina with the current inflation to do any savings. I just got my hand on about half BTC. I'l holding the same for over 3 years now. Never spending a bit. To whoever is helping with these "digital" gestures: 15H1B2bX4rDB2DVQKfYETiLgw5pgpzBRCc 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:29:42
I'm optimistic, but going to 330.000 next year is pure nonsense. Sorry, won't happen.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:50:49
I think the 40k scenario is perfectly possible, we have up movents of around 1500 USD in just a couple of days, these price variations are the key because show the potential growth.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:07:48
Not a natural dip, Ver and his troupe are pumping btrash again.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:46:42
Its nothing in the global scale. Nothing.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:43:55
haha fuc.ing amateurs.
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:13:36
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:12:28
This is ridiculous. A bunch of fuckers with tons of Asics are doing what they want.
This is a very strong warning to the Core team.
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:17:27
huh... never thought about that.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:59:43
Ask John Titor.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:07:38
Bitcoin means transfer of value, person to person, online, without intermediaries. It's a revolutionary concept, it means eventually the end of third parties and even a lot of banks functions.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:39:19
Cool, my goal is to have 1 entire btc, I'm currently at 0,57, any help will be appreciated.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:46:13
Yes, I can: the whole thing is a big charade controlled by a few hands. Its destined to fail.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:55:06
Thanks I've set my sell order at 45k
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:02:33
Shit not again. Tired of this stupid dance.
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:27:33
1 million dollars per coin. 2025-2030. Hodl until then.
@_date: 2019-12-01 02:38:02
Never did, mined LTC in some years ago.
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:02:32
done reported as scam to Google.
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:10:56
With so many forks, just doing that isn't practical. Eventually if you want to reclaim fork tokens, you have to move everything to a new address.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:11:08
All cryptos going down, profit taking
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:16:43
Yes exactly, this is revolutionary. Kudos for all the people behind these funds.
@_date: 2019-09-10 23:07:00
Nobody will tip 1 BTC from now on. Ever again.
@_date: 2019-09-11 04:51:25
Yes, somebody, please. ��
