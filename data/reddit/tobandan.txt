To be honest, I've never had trouble with Coinify as a payment processor through hungry.dk (a just-eat alternative)
Never had to wait more than 5 seconds after sending the transaction through my client.

The roller coaster is wild today
@_date: 2016-06-06 21:43:18
Happy cakeday! :)
EDIT: Aww, I'm too late :(

Please let the ride stand by until I can get moar

On a bit larger scale it's trending up
@_date: 2015-11-06 07:11:24
Whelp, I guess one can only ride the wave like everybody else and hope for new wind.
The long game is ahead of us still. Bitcoin has tremendous potential.
@_date: 2015-11-06 19:39:59
So get ready for a huge up or downward shift in price?
Watching the graph tick about is mesmerizing
@_date: 2015-11-07 01:30:26
Anything can happen in the future if the majority of users agree on it.
Even bit retrieval.
@_date: 2015-11-06 05:55:33
It's possible!
@_date: 2015-11-06 06:25:56
I say it's a scam for some bit grabbing action
@_date: 2015-11-07 01:56:29
There is not. You'd have to own 51% of the network at least to call any shots whatsoever.
@_date: 2015-11-06 01:27:26
The total amount of bitcoins in circulation would decrease, and as such the price will correct given no bitcoin tech catastrophes happen.
Keep calm and HODL

I could gift you a card if you want?

Bitcoin IS money, but it's not backed by the financial institutions of today.
It's so far from dollars that they might never be supported in the current system.
@_date: 2015-11-07 01:11:50
That's how I feel towards the 50BTC I once sold at 12$

Exchanges will exist as long as people require fiat. 
That is a fact we can't change without tremendous force.
@_date: 2015-11-17 18:04:41
How much is it?
I wouldn't mind helping a fella out. I'm in the EU too.
@_date: 2015-11-11 17:17:11
@_date: 2015-11-06 03:59:39
Oh, thanks! I hadn't noticed actually.
I recall mining about 5-6 from laptop mining as well.
How do you cope? Have you re-invested?
@_date: 2015-11-04 03:30:16
To the mun!
@_date: 2015-11-04 02:16:01
Can't wait
@_date: 2015-11-07 04:29:30
Post the resulting powerpoint/document when you're done :)
@_date: 2015-11-06 19:56:32
All around good dude, but there are legal issues I'd look into if I were you :)

You might want to look into coinify.com. They allow sending invoices to clients making them pay in fiat, but converting them to bitcoin and sending them to your address afterwards.
I believe they take a commision of 3.9% but it lowers after you increase your level by use and verification.
