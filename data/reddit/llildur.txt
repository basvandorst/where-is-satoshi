In my opinion Monero is a better option regarding security and anonimity, Dash isn't designed to be a anon crypto, Dash uses x11 algo, the blocksize is limited to 2 user transactions, that's what they have to rely on masternodes to obfuscate the transactions, they try to implement ring signatures one year ago unsuccessfully because the bloat-issues.

This is misleading in the extreme.
In 2010 someone produced a contrived transaction that made a billion bitcoins out of thin air. Users applied a fix for that bug, and naturally the network reorged to exclude that transaction after a majority of hashpower was fixed. No normal funds were confiscated, the network wasn't hardforked. Old clients continued to operate.
In the second, unknown to anyone older software was unreliable at reorging when blocks were very large. A miner started producing larger blocks and there was a block race, the vast majority of nodes on the network ended up rejecting the chain that that miner was on. But most miners were already on newer software and didn't. After it was clear that most of the network was rejecting the chain they were on, they switch to the chain accepted by most of the network. Again no hardfork, no confiscated funds, and older software continued to work.
By contrast there have been many large services that lost tons of coin (including mtgox's insolvency which was on the order of 10% of all existing coins), large losses in mybitcoin, bitcoinica and many other cases. No one called for a network bailout in these cases and if they had they would have been laughed at. These cases are the closer parallel to the situation with ethereum.

Many people in Mexico don't have acces to exchange their Bitcoins for fiat in an app so in spikes of the price of Bitcoin you should see many people trying to take advantaje of price and a decent volume of fiat of course, not to everyday volume but of course in certain times like spikes and dips of the market if you are really trying to support Bitcoiners then adding this feature will really help people otherwise is a waste of time and no reason to use your service cause US people already have Coinbase and multiple exchanges who offers a superior service but for Bitcoiners of Mexico and others countries were they can't use a credit/debit card will be a huge advantage.

Alts are the extension of Bitcoin capabilities, is the lab were you can build everything that Bitcoin can't risk to, as you say Alts are primarily a speculative field in all senses, to me the best alts build upon Bitcoin like XCP and OMNI, because they benefit from each other, ETH in the other hand is aimed to supress the network efect of Bitcoin like a competitor. focused in smart contracts and inflacionary monetary base, personally i support the alts that work like  second layer of BTC but there are some interesting projects like BTS and NXT that caugth my eye.

I'm not surprised the vast majority of supportters of Ver are miners and companies since the 1M block allow more people to run a full node at lowers costs, AFIAK BTC is not damage because up layers only settling micropayments on the main chain like Visa or Mastercard does with central banks BTC is not intended to be the US Dollar of Crypto is intended to be the XAU of it, or more properly the SDR of Digital Currencies, Ripple, ETH and many more can experiment with smart contracts and whatever they want BTC is already acomplishing their mission in that sense i think Satoshi failed to recognize that, first of all because the very scarse supply of BTC and secondly for the great value per unit, the primarily function of BTC is a store of value, it doesn't deny the other  properties of money but in a sense is the gold standard of crypto or the SDR of central banks IMO LN can allow to acomplish the Visa Function but the IMF and central bank function remains on BTC core. If more people can run full nodes then centralization is not a great problem but if not only a handfull of miners can they will manipulate the important decisions in this space, like is happening rigth now with segwit.
@_date: 2016-12-25 19:30:49

None BTC is primarily a store of value like gold, nobody goes around spending gold, instead, they keep it safe and preserve wealth. you can use BTS,NXT,ETH, like smart money because they cover other aspects, most people don't get that,  like Ver and blocksize trolls, the main function of BTC is to be the most secure and decentralized chain around.

@_date: 2017-04-23 00:01:08
The Chinese mining cartel does not care about blocks at all, it is the same 1Mb or 100Mb for them as far as they can still influence and profit from BTC LTC or whatever coin, they only believe in money and power nothing else, all this debate Is not for the size of blocks is for profit and power over the people and the whole system, just heard those pedantic miners talk, how they try to arrange this "roundtables" to secure their interest not in favor of comunity of course, that's why They support this useful idiot called Roger Ver with BU, but they are careless about those philosophical dabates as far as they have centralized mining, in other words power to decide who lives and who dies, but they can´t stop an idea and can´t stop the progress UASF now.
@_date: 2017-04-13 18:02:51
Why they don't just make his own alt and do whatever they want with that, why they still keep breaking the balls of all Bitcoin comunity? it's obvious that BTC can't be the everyday coin because is scarce and precious like gold how don't get it FFS.

Segwit average 2-4 MB block we don´t even tested yet so you can't argue this would be obsolete in short time, lets bring Segwit then look for other options, but the core issue here is not full blocks is profit, power and influence of miners over the whole comunity that's the real problem, don't you see? they are careless about tech or comunity, they think we are their employes and can fired us anytime, they hostage tech in favor of their interest they broke the social contract and extort all of us.

I disagree anyway if someone purchase stuff with big retailers they instantly convert this amount in worthless fiat again there is no sense in spending some very scarce resource like bitcoin in trivial stuff and BTW the value of bitcoin doesn't depend on number of transactions at all, it is just a parameter of interest and especulation in the markets, the real value is far far away this measure.

Oh no this shity economic grow theory again, bitcoin is Not a every day good or service you have to promote or grow organically is a piece of tech that can change the way u make business and interact with other people, is much more than that indeed, this is the chair game, everyone is looking for a sit please don't fall for this romantic view of a nice organic grow economy of bitcoin. HODL only spend if you need to.

This is amazing for me and all the mexican people, until now here there's no easy way to buy Bitcoins, some minor exchanges exists but this is a really game changer, if this going further, maybe will be the mexican coinbase, easy and reliable, we really needed something like this happen in our country.

You are missing that the halving reduce the overal infaltion also, so probably the crash after the bubble don't spill so much cause this time the price just gonna go upwards, and since ETH has no capped limit when it crashes not even the floor can stop it without mention that ETH is so much overbougth ATM, and the infamous DAO has more than 10% of total supply ready to spend.
@_date: 2017-05-16 05:47:28
seems legit
@_date: 2016-05-17 06:46:05
That's right baby, from here to beyond there´s not more dump without regret because this ship can only go upwards.

Nothing has happened? please give me a break.
@_date: 2017-06-15 02:35:44
Their are trying to shake all the weak hands, everyone is runing towards ETH but is game over by now, new millionares been made since one year ago now the only way is down, the real value in ETH is now over new projects not in the ETH by itself, honestly i never saw a rise like that in just one year almost the same marketcap that BTC accumulated in 8 years, that was just insane, ppl will regret this hype in a non distant future.

Bittrex is better than polo to me, except for volume is the most reliable exchange, polo manipulate the market at their will,  server is bugy, not so much interesting coins  and not so many analizing tools, capchas every refresh page and so on and so for, Bittrex only  ask for captachas on the login stage then you can surf the site without this hassle.
@_date: 2016-07-02 07:34:43
ETH as we know it now is pretty dead good luck with that.
