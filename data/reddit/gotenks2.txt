very simple. First Mexico checks all CC purchases to compare it to your income and see if you're evading taxes.
And the US is interested first in tax evasion as I said and the most important thing... For visa aprovals; Keep in mind that mexicans are required visa to enter into the US and the US goverment checks a lot of information to determine the eligibility... Also keep in mind that Mexico is the country with most US visa application in the world. Don't you think all that info would be very useful for that purpose? (Specially considering that most of the illegal immigrants in the US are mexicans)... If I could see your bank statements and/or CC purchases I'd know a lot about you (personality, income, habits etc..)


We all know that Mexico is a partner of the US (for not saying the backyard) ... Here it's very known that the Mexican goverment shares and sends all the databases to the US gov.

It's not spam... they sell a service but I think we all must know what this law is... Beleave me I don't reveice anything from that firm.. I don't even think they have something that it's worth but what concerns me is the law itself.
 I thought that wasn't true but that law is on the US Dept. of the Treasury webpage... this is real.
Here's the link if you want to read it...
And the worst part of this law is starting after July...

Yes... Mexico. Here, the goverment watch every bank and credit card transaction. Even when you pay some shopping by credit card the menchant keeps one copy of the receipt another one is given to you and another one is provided to SAT (Mexican IRS) electronically with all your information.... And besides watching us, the mexican goverment sends all the data to the US goverment as well (they share all the info).

I think overnight is pretty exaggerated too and it's to scare you and sell you his product but what I think is that eventually probably in the coming years if the US gov continues with this law the IMF and many countries would consider to switch to another currency as international currency... the thing is Which one?... The only probable one could e the Euro but probably is in the same or even worse situation than the USD. So it wouldn't be so easy.
And what I think is that this law definitivaly will affect bitcoin somehow... It'll benefit it in some ways and harm it in others, like I said, to some exchanges that work in USD like bitstamp.
@_date: 2014-04-26 04:02:02
And I think that bitcoin exchanges that deal in USD like Bitstamp will be affected by this law as well... either they have to comply with the law or switch to another fiat currency.

With your explanation now I finally understand how Income is considered... I'm not US resident but I travel a lot there, sometimes for business and sometimes as tourist and when you apply for the visa you're told that you cannot get any kind of income in the US and it's strictly prohibited. And I have even got an example that if stay at a friend/family house and I do some kind of work (like making their garden or something like that) in exchange for the food and my stay IT IS CONSIDERED INCOME... hence I'd be breaking the law.
It sounded stupid to me but with your explanation now I get it.
Of course that's in theory but in practice if someone would do that of course nobody would tell the US Gov. and it's almost imposible for them to figure it out, but that's what the law says.

Yeah they want to sell their service and I'm not interested in that but what I mean is the FATCA law itself... here's what it says (it's actually more in the middle if the text rathen than the last part):
"Here's what's happening...
In 2010, the U.S. Congress passed House of Representatives bill H.R. 2847.
Hidden within this bill is a provision known as "FATCA," which stands for the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act.
This bill does several important things, as of July 1st, 2014:
1. It forces all worldwide banks to comply with the IRS if they have any transactions in U.S. dollars.
2. Because the U.S. dollar is still the world's reserve currency, it essentially means ALL WORLDWIDE BANKS, except for the smallest community institutions, must comply.
3. To comply, banks can either spend a fortune segmenting, tracking, and potentially "taxing" their U.S. dollar transactions by as much as 30%... or they can simply get rid of all of their U.S. customers.
In other words, the U.S. government is saying to all banks around the world: If you deal in U.S. dollars in any way, you have to give us full, unfettered access to all of these transactions... or you have to get rid of all of your U.S. customers."

And now at $ 640 in 5 minutes.... that's volatility... time to invest
EDIT: $650 !!! in lees than a minute
@_date: 2014-04-15 01:57:38
And it is ironic how a fat guy steals millions (almost a billion) of dollars in BTC from a lot of customers and receives no penalty... The system is so stupid.

I got everything fixed. The thing was that I sent that time my Credit Card statement as a proof of address and now they no longer accept them, so I sent a utility bill and that was it.
Besides as I'm not trading for now cuz I think (in my personal opinion) is not a good time to either buy or sell I withdrew all my coins and sent'em into cold storage to have'em safe for now... (after what hapenned with many ppl Goxed) and if the price raises enough to sell I'll send them or if the price falls enough to buy I'll fund fiat by ripple and that's it.
I know many ppl say it's unsafe to keep the money in exchanges but the thing is that when the price is very volatile it's very slow to have it in cold storage and send it back to the exchange... surely you'd lose a good oportunity when the confirmations get to the exchange. But now that it's stable I think it's good time to have the coins in cold storage

I didnt mentioned to be prosecuted by american justice... He stole not only americans but citizens of all over the world (japan included)... what is ironic is that this affected a lot more ppl than what Charlie shrem could've done and no one is even interested in investigating that case.

Probably what it says is very exaggerated but the part of the law and how the US gov. is in debt is not... and this law somehow will affect bitcoin... probably will benefit it or nor but affect it after all.... For ex: the exchanges... would have to either comply with the law... or switch to another currency and avoid USD.
In the other hand probably many ppl who doesn't want to be watch by the IRS or the US Gov. will switch they invesment into bitcoins... but I think this will be interesting in the coming months.

Here's in wikipedia too..
@_date: 2014-05-07 19:31:18
I don't know but this is becoming insane. I know many ppl with payments delayed for those stupid policies. What I don't get is that they become scricter with that and others exchanges like BTC-e ask you nothing.

And here's the key fact of this law:
From Wikipedia:
*    **Foreign relations.** Forcing foreign financial institutions and foreign governments to collect data on U.S. citizens at their own expense and transmit it to the IRS has been called divisive. Canada's former Finance Minister Jim Flaherty raised an issue with this "far reaching and extraterritorial implications" which would require Canadian banks to become extensions of the IRS and would jeopardize Canadians' privacy rights.[36] There are also reports of many foreign banks refusing to open accounts for Americans, making it harder for Americans to live and work abroad.[37]
*   **Extraterritoriality.** The legislation enables U.S. authorities to impose regulatory costs, and potentially penalties, on foreign financial institutions who otherwise have few if any dealings with the United States.[38] The U.S. has sought to ameliorate that criticism by offering reciprocity to potential countries who sign Intergovernmental Agreements, but the idea of the US Government providing information on its citizens to foreign governments has also proved controversial.[39] The law's interference in the relationship between individual Americans or dual nationals and non-American banks led Georges Ugeux to term it "bullying and selfish."[40]

I think what would give a lot more value to the Bitcoins would be an easier way to get em... For example putting more ATM's.
Here in Mexico for ex. and many other 3rd world contries it's not so easier to get BTC than in the US or Europe. Here we only have several options on localbitcoins or send a wire transfer to an overseas exchange which cost money and time. 
I have no problem because I live close to the US border and I have a US bank account so I have more options to trade but if I could find an ATM at my corner store or at a shopping mall nearby and exchange there to send money to my brother who lives in Spain it would be a lot worth than anything else.
SO I think the future in this wonderful technology would be more exchanges and ATM's to get it easier to get.

I forgot: The same reason why they'd be interested (Us Gov.) in having an NSA spying center inside the US Embassy in Mexico City, spying phone lines, cell phones, emails and many communications of all mexicans... and that is confirmed by both the US and mexican media (you can find that info online)... it was confimed and authorized by the mexican gov. as well
And it's also known they have another spying center in Monterrey (northern mexico)... not confimred by the Mexican Gov.

That's right. Here in Mexico as Public schools are a mess and awful, most middle-class and even lower middle-class ppl (and of course the rich) send their children to private schools... and public schools are almost for the poorest, hence there are a lot of private schools anywhere (from liitle ones to big ones) and you can find private schools for as low as 100 dlls a month... They're pretty cheaper than in the US or any first world country.
In the US it's different because public schools have good level (or at least a lot better than public schools in Mexico) so middle class ppl send their children to public schools... but here if you want your children have a good or decent education level, you have to pay, but as I said, that makes private schools cheaper.
Besides the goverment here put a law where you can deduct the 100% of your private school payments from your taxes... which is logic as your kid's aducation is not costing the goverment.
