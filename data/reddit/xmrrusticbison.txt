The UX will be different. The process/outcome will be the same.

From their own [FAQ]( 
*"Ultimately, we will call the fork with the most accumulated difficulty Bitcoin. We will wait for a period of time after the fork, before finalizing the naming."*
*"We hope to re-enable deposits and withdrawals for BTC and B2X within 48 hours after the fork, but this is subject to network considerations."*
You're welcome to roll the dice with the primary backer of the network disruption.

Never trust a third party with your Bitcoins; never leave your Bitcoins on an exchange. Once you've given your Bitcoins away, consider them gone.

Because it is a vocal supporter and signer of the NYA, Coinbase has a vested interest in the outcome of the fork. I would not trust them/GDAX with any coins, as they might use your own money to trade against your interests. They could also prevent withdrawals, claiming the network is unstable. 
Don't forget that they are still holding their client's funds from the last fork, perhaps loaning them out and earning interest....

A tiny little increase in the block size, from 1MB to 2MB, would help to weaken the distribution of the Bitcoin network and make it easier to attack. I'm starting to think that this proposed fork and a lot of the FUD and strange behaviors I've seen recently could potentially be the work of [an organization famous for intentionally weakening encryption standards](

The best thing to do is to simply run a full node.

Falcon Bank is a well known private bank in Switzerland, it is currently trying to build a strong reputation for itself as the digital bank of the future and is making very good progress. Until now, it's been very difficult for Bitcoin whales to outsource the responsibility of protecting their Bitcoin. Not everyone wants to sleep with their money under their mattress, especially if you have so much of it that it causes you to worry all the time. This move also opens the door to investment in Bitcoin by [family offices]( and other wealthy individuals who would otherwise have difficulty investing in it.
