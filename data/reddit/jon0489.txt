Absolutely, Gifts cards are subject to discretion by their processing bank or institution. I was unable to use any prepaid visa cards bought in the USA in most middle east and eastern European countries. I called to find out why and was told that it was because they are" high fraud areas" and there is no way to use the cards in those countries.

Lets just hope they didn't get hacked.  Fingers crossed.

Better question is, have you bought anything yet with your Bitcons?

There goes my 15.9 BTC. . .   :(

WOW CNN. THIS IS WHY YOU SUCK. GET SOME FACT CHECKERS. MILLION NOT BILLION.
"There are currently 11.9 billion bitcoins in circulation. Some bitcoin users tend to get more attention, such as those illicit buyers at online black markets like the recently closed Silk Road. They tend to be drawn to the anonymous nature of the currency."

You all are better off spending the money on Block Eruptors. Your BFL units will provide nothing but network security by the time your order arrives. Want to mine something but dust? ASICMINER is your only sure bet. Good luck... I suggest Eleuthria ...He is a great guy who is selling them at near cost.

I am so pissed. I trusted tradefortress. I feel like such an idiot.  All my  savings have been stolen.  Such a dumb move to keep my funds with coinlenders. It's all gone .    :( 
I am such an idiot to trust a pseudonym with all the money I had in the world.  I suppose what everyone says here is the best advice; only trust a web wallet where you know the owners identity and where they can be prosecuted by law.

You live in a communist country.  Youre going to have to get used to these actions. If they control a fundamental right such as the amount of children you can have this action should not come as a supprise.  You are better off leaving China and going to live in a democracy. Come to America, you are welcome to be a libertarian and have as many children as you want.

Yup. I think the demo instance preface on coinlenders was a prelude to this.

They now use inputs.io to deposit. Your old deposit address will not  work.

Who knows. This is a speculate market. Whatever the markets choose will be the price.  If people knew, market fluctuations wouldn't swing so drastically.   You are asking people to predict the future.  I wouldn't come here for market advice. r/bitcoin is a huge circlejerck. Most people only give advice that benefits themselves.  Honestly Bitcoin has some serious growing up to do.  As many have stated it will need to stabilize to be integrated as a true ecommence payment method this is just one of the many hurdles it must overcome.
