Sure but then there’s another scenario which is you invest an amount you’re not upset in losing say $1000 and it turns into $40k at its peak. Then it goes down to $20k. I’m sure most hodlers would be upset in losing (unrealized but still) $20k. But no, just hodl because everything is FUD and we’re going to the moon this time it’s different etc.

A trader can guess wrong but still make a ton AND have an exit strategy every time the tide turns, so that maybe when the tide turns for good his money will be out. Hodling will outperform disciplined trading most of the time until btc crashes for good or something else happens to cripple the entire market for 5 years plus

This “hodl and you’ll win” shit is getting on my nerves. If you read the post he was using over leveraged positions in an irrational way without any discipline or risk management. 
You can absolutely lose trading, but you can also absolutely lose “hodling” fucking hate that word. Just because it has worked in our near perma-bull market to hold crypto doesn’t mean it always will and if there is a real crash without recovery, it won’t matter if you hodld for 1 month or 6 years your asset will dry up and lose 90% of it’s worth. 
This isn’t fud, I’m a believer in crypto, but bad shit happens and telling people to stfu and buy the dip and hold is such a trash approach to “investing”
Edit: also the argument that trading fees turn trading to a zero sum game is baseless. GDAX doesn’t even have fees for limit orders

Pretty much all. Some stuff has other pairs like eth or neo, but when btc goes down so do those lol
@_date: 2018-09-03 23:51:50
Bull run already started
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:30:32
Alts go down with bitcoin because it’s the most common trading pair. When the asset you’re buying an alt with becomes much less valuable you can buy less of it

No you won’t

Why doesn’t the fact that a bitcoin can be infinitely divided to adjust to its higher price provide an argument against your statement that bitcoin as a deflationary currency is not effective? 
People could just buy a coffee with .0000001 BTC instead of .001 BTC.

Shouldn’t it be impossible for a group to manipulate how many transactions bitcoin can process?

Too late for what? If you believe in btc you think it’s will go to 100k in the coming years 
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:56:09
This is a trading subreddit so I assumed you knew how to make that decision on your own. Ideally though a crypto would go up for at LEAST two weeks straight before entering after a massive crash like this. If it falls again then you stop loss
Edit: nvm I realized this is in not which explains a lot
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:48:32
Exactly, it may not be btc. So hodling btc no matter what still doesn’t make sense
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:22:35
Not really
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:54:28
This really does seem like something posted right before an economic collapse 
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:35:02
It will 100% be worth it if BTC never recovers and goes to 1k or lower. Not saying I think this will happen, but BTC is about as speculative of an investment as you can get and I’m happy to be out even if my reentry isn’t much lower than my exit 
@_date: 2018-03-11 13:31:55

Golds current mcap is I believe ~7 trillion. BTC current mcap is 125 bil. 7 tril / 125 bil = 56 times.

With increased price comes more attention from the public which in turn introduces BTC and blockchain to new people that may become involved in the space. Price absolutely plays a massive role in the adoption and development of BTC.
