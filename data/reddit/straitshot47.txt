Lmao ya go from the Euro, which can't be created out of thin air, and large countries benefited because the larger population acted like inflation.  
Where the small countries got really fucked.
You wanna tell these small countries to use bitcoin?  They'll laugh in your face.
@_date: 2019-07-25 16:13:21
Hell no.
Why do you advocate using bitcoin over gold?
@_date: 2019-07-25 20:59:52
I understand money better than most.
Does the video explain how an average joe, just coming onto their own, working 40-50 hours a week buys a house without a loan on a bitcoin standard?
I want to understand how a world of bitcoin will work for the children or those not born yet.
@_date: 2019-07-25 16:34:49
All of those points are extremely debatable....
If  less intelligent people knew how to use gold for the past 4,000+ years.  Explain your points bud...
@_date: 2019-07-25 15:57:23
I know going back to a gold standard is wrong.
@_date: 2019-07-25 22:39:42
Yes prices would go down until the amount of resources hits a limit, and since a price can't go below 0 there would be a floor.
In fact you would reach a point where people would have to pay you to buy a product.
Again houses would have to abide by the above rules.

So long as we have a growing population inflation will be a thing.
Why do you favor deflation when you overpay on your taxes?
@_date: 2019-07-25 15:51:26
And you just wanna go back to a gold standard basically.
@_date: 2019-07-25 17:02:19
The US was on a gold standard when the great depression[deflation] hit.
Deflation is not based on debt, plus what about negative rates?
@_date: 2019-07-25 23:12:08
How about a spiritual or intelect exchange?
@_date: 2019-07-25 15:16:00
I hope we can move past currency, they're all worthless.
If the resource is there and can be utilized why the need for currency?
@_date: 2019-07-25 21:05:10
Do you know how much deflation will need to occur to buy a house without a loan?
@_date: 2019-07-25 22:23:29
It's just mathematics. In a fiat system population growth can be accounted for.
In a fixed amount[gold/bitcoin] and deflationary system you're going to have to do annual pay cuts to account for population growth. If you don't how can you afford new hires?
 Put on top of that there's only so many homes out there.
@_date: 2019-07-25 19:42:50
No crap.
But it helps afford things like a house or car.
You probably live in a home that was paid for by a mortgage, or maybe your moms basement that was paid with a mortgage, or an apartment probably bought with a loan by the owner..
@_date: 2019-07-25 15:44:50
Because all you're advocating for is the gold standard.
@_date: 2019-07-25 15:27:23
No sane person thinks we can go back to the gold standard.
If you believe what's in that paper, then why not just go back to the gold standard?  Utilize the block chain, but just go back to the system and rules we already had 100+ years ago.
I'm not going to read that whole article, but does it state why bitcoin would be better than gold?
@_date: 2019-07-25 16:55:39
Look at greece and italy, they can't print their own money.
@_date: 2019-07-25 21:19:20
Except there's 330,000,000 Americans here now.
Do you know how much deflation would need to occur to make this viable?
@_date: 2019-07-25 15:33:22
This is insane.
@_date: 2019-07-25 20:26:13
You're right in a fiat system population doesn't matter.
But in a deflationary/gold/bitcoin/fixed amount scenario population definitely has something to do with it.
How do you propose people buy houses in your no loan/bitcoin world?  Wages[in bitcoin]are gonna have to be substantially higher and house prices are going to have to fall astronomically.
@_date: 2019-07-25 15:33:42
This is ridiculous.
@_date: 2019-07-25 16:38:59
If only most backera of bitcoin understood what you're advocating for they wouldn't want in.
@_date: 2019-07-25 19:03:06
And I showed you that Greece and Italy can't print their own currency.  Greece went bankrupt 8 times.
