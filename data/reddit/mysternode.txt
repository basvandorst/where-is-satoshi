Many people get paid in BTC.  Other people actually went ALL IN.  
It isn't that easy to live on BTC and this app will help and not regret the necessary purchases they make along the way.

Comparing deflationary currencies to inflationary currencies only has value in the short-term.

Lower interest rates = increase supply of USD by printing more = More Inflation = USD loses buying power.
Therefore, it takes more USD to buy BTC.

All financial instruments are manipulated.
The price is the price at this moment but what actually matters is that 1 BTC = 1 BTC.

I used Purse many times over the last 2 years with great experiences. 
I just had an issue with interface and customer support was awful.  Zero accountability - No voice support - I had to pay for their mistakes.

Why didn't he at very least address whether or not he saw Bitcoin as HEDGE in the upcoming crash.

1 BTC = 1 BTC
The value of 1 BTC in USD fluctuates, not the amount of BTC you will have...

You will never understand bitcoin if you don't understand money.
Step one:  Understand what money is and how it is created and what gives it value.
Step two:  Read Satoshi Whitepaper

It makes sense when you're able to see a world where the dollar is no longer used....

The website has it all wrong... 
It's emphasis is 100% on bitcoin's growth rather than the USD's deterioration...

1. RUN FAST from [Libertypool.com]( or Ponzipool 
2. Buy Bitcoin with what you can afford to lose.
3. Hold it in a hardware wallet
4. Maybe you'll be wealthy and NEVER invest in ANYTHING that tries to hook you with the "Financial Freedom" - maybe you'll just hedge inflation but at least you won't lose your ass in Libertypool.

The % should be based on Organic commodities since that is all there was in the 1950s.  Example is not Apples to Apples and therefore underestimates real inflationary rates.

The segment was a historical account of bitcoin and could have been run in 2015.  No aspect was very timely or newsworthy...  It was more positive than expected.

No need to run a node...  
Here's the bes thing you can do for bitcoin based on the info you have provided.
When you buy anything, especially from a mom and pop place - just ask if they accept Bitcoin upon checkout.  Merchant adoption is paramount and the voice of one's clients is essential for businesses to accept new forms of payment.

Familiar with "Buy on the rumor - Sell on the news"?
It applies to Bitcoin too...  Play the long game, we'll get there when we get there...

Those are good friends.  
From 1st hand experience, it is really hard to see it when you're in it.  But you'll likely realize other toxic things about your ex as you become whole again.
Best wishes!  And congrats on the weight loss!

Craigslist has a cryptocurrency option.  Less trustworthy as a platform and  I have contacted some folks about buying Cars with Bitcoin and it appears they checked the box with no idea what crypto is...
