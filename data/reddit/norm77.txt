About 2000 BTC were burned, equivalent to $2mln at the time.
That's one hell of a "pre-mine"!

Burn gave 1000-1500 XCP per BTC. BTC back then was around $1000.
This summer you could get 350 XCP per BTC but the price of BTC was much lower. In terms of dollar the price wasn't that much higher.
Also, this summer there was a working GUI wallet and a flourishing Counterparty ecosystem. 
Today there's a lot - A LOT - more going than during this summer.
I'd say XCP is a better investment now than it has ever been before. But that's just my opinion.

If they did I'd run my node on the old code. So would most nodes. Hence it is impossible.
Btw, there's no need to create more XCP. It's divisible up to eight digits. There'll never be a shortage.

Can Counterparty assets be used as a decentralized DNS ala Namecoin?

Gavin Andresen said that Ethereum is "playing whack-a-mole with security and DoS vulnerabilities". Isn't there a risk that a badly written smart contract can crash the nodes, i.e. the entire Counterparty network?
Even if the technology is secure, how do you plan on incentivizing users not to spam the network? A fee will work, but how to set it a decent level? If XCP goes up in price, the fee can become crippling high.
As Counterparty grows it will be expensive to run a node. You plan on "burning" the fees, right? So there's no direct reward for running a node?
Finally, may I ask how much XCP that are in the hands of the founders? ;)
Keep up the good work, guys!

Anyone can make a platform for that. I'd love to see a site on format  where the owner of TOKEN can publish his web site.
