Which is why this is widely recognized as the first bubble that's been solely publicly driven.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:30:20
You're correct that nobody knows what'll happen-- I absolutely could be wrong.  This chart, coupled with the recent fervor, is as best as I have to guide my investment decision making.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:57:23
If I can make a friendly suggestion-- don't go 100% in at 12.  Use dollar cost averaging and invest on the wave.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:22:06
Being worth something in the long run isn't necessarily related to a bubble. Just look at NASDAQ circa 2000s
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:24:09
Up. 400% or down 75%. All a perspective of when a person got in (note- I sold at $18k two weeks ago expecting this shit)
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:17:47
It'll stop around $5000.  You might see it go up again before that but yeah, this bubble is a poppin'
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:32:01
A rise was expected. It's behaving exactly like a bubble that's about to pop.
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:39:22
I love this so much.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:04:21
Back when NASDAQ was at 5000 in 2001 a couple of companies made poorly timed large stock sells that triggered the crash. It just takes something small when people are already on edge from large gains.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:00:24
Judging by my downvotes I'd go for delusion :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:52:40
Sell brah
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:08:37
No, I'm saying that if this is really the bubble popping vs just a normal sell off, you should expect to see BTC go down to around $5k or so

"redditor for 2 weeks" 
got it
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:35:19
People don't want to hear the real news when it's bad.  They'll regret not listening when it's too late.
I SODL two weeks ago knowing this was coming.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:14:11
How do you read that sells are down to 2k? The buy/sell spread is right around $4329 from what I can tell
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:05:21
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:40:12
I guessed that the first sell off was around $5000
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:13:34
I'm aware that others have said this earlier in the year; this isn't new information.  I'm also aware that the month of May, BTC rose around an aggregate 25% to just over $2k, and subsequently took another 4-5 months to double from there.  During the first two weeks of December, BTC went up just more than 2x from around $10k to $20k.  Nothing about that is healthy.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:48:10
If this is really the bubble popping it's going to go a lot lower than this...
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:37:58
You have no control over what Asian markets do; they're behind the recent astronomical gains.  
The second largest Korean market went bankrupt because of a North Korean hack... do you think that instills confidence in their market?
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:28:26
And Bitcoin isn't a currency sub (re: fiat bubble), that much should be fairly obvious by now with the volatility we've seen this past year
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:40:31
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:47:26
Much familiar?

"redditor for six weeks"
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:52:30
I know I'm going to get a lot of hate for this post, but this forum needs a bearish outlook against all of the feel-good $100k predictions on here.  Feel free to compare BTC's rise since March 2017 vs this chart on your own time.  I don't dispute the long-term value of bitcoin and blockchain, but this definitely seems like the bubble is about to burst.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:30:58
I'm trying to get your goat, man.  Mission accomplished.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:00:01
Bitcoin is all speculation right now. If you can't admit that then there's no helping you.
Look at what's going on with Coinbase right now. Also, compare NASDAQ from 1995-2001 and compare it to BTC this year;  the charts are almost identical. Tulips, Dot com, housing market, etc.  A bubble is a bubble is a bubble

Disagreed. I'd argue that the inflection point between enthusiasm and greed occurred somewhere around the $12k mark. The first sell-off occurred at $5k

"Im a hodler since just about 3 weeks back, lately the fees have gone up to more than 20 bucks. This cant be sustainable in the longrun. Im not selling my btc, and im not buying bcash. Ive heard and read about segwit and lightning but it will take awhile until its implemented, if it even works properly. Isnt this going to result in btc going down?"

There's a lot of posts like OPs right now, I'm guessing from people who just got in recently. The 2000% increase is meaningless to them.
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:38:54
Is there any way to do that through a reputable exchange?  CBOE only takes institutional investors and I'm not that bigly
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:36:36
Also-- if you created this chart, you should update it. We're in the "return to normal phase"
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:45:55
I don't dispute the value of bitcoin or blockchain as a whole (I'm actually writing a 10k word research paper on it).  I'd rather play the bubble as best I can to maximize my gains.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:42:19
There's a reason why technical analysis is taken with a grain of salt in mainstream investing.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:29:11
U mad cuz u got in @ $19k bro?

I hate to say I told you so but... actually I don't.
