Pools should be accountable to participating miners, and in general, to the users. Most do have web presence, but all they post is inane PR bullshit instead of substantial information. (Respect to Slushpool for being the exception.)
I'm not worried about me. I'm worried about havoc on the network.
@_date: 2018-09-26 13:38:19
Do we know anything about the responsiveness of the developers who create the modified software for the mining pools?
And in this case, if an update is issued, who would have to update? The pool operator, the individual miners, or both?
@_date: 2018-09-26 12:11:10
It may be rejected by non-mining full nodes, but other non-patched miners will still build on it, which is pretty bad. If only Slush updated, a split would mean super-long block times for updated nodes until the next adjustment, and, well, inflation for the rest.
And I don't believe your point is true, because most nodes (92% as of writing) [haven't updated](

If you verify, you can get a $10k/day credit card withdrawal limit or even unlimited if you verify to the "plus" tier. If you withdraw from card to cex.io, they charge something around 3-4%. Then you can use the "Trade" tab to do exchanging.
If you use the more direct "buy/sell" tab, they charge around 8%.

So Coinbase Vault holds the private keys to Vault accounts?
@_date: 2017-02-04 18:52:59
Does this Vault have access to the private keys to the addresses on which your bitcoins reside?
If the answer is "yes", it is not *your* money completely, but at least yours and Coinbase's. In a worse case, it's only theirs, and all you possess is a promise. If you are unsure about the ownership of private keys, ask them.
It's all very well that these services make life simple for some people. But remember, when they are gag-ordered by the local government for whatever reason, assaulted by an asset forfeiture order (remember Cyprus?), or hacked by people with evil intentions, people who kept their money there will lose what they had very quickly, and may even end up on a list with their personal info which they rather wouldn't. I can believe that these services are honest and with the best intentions, but even that doesn't defend them from the threats I outlined. They can help to certain lengths to secure assets, but only You, the rightful Owner can practice ownership, through the exclusive ownership of the private keys.
Bitcoin is about liberty of private ownership. That is very unpopular and rare in our present mainstream culture and infrastructure. That is why these seemingly extra steps are involved (like generating a seed and using different addresses), and that is why so many people are confused about it and find it difficult. The techie aspect may be scary. But the reason these measures are needed are much scarier to most. And knowing them, I'd rather teach myself or those who matter to me some techie knowledge, than maintain the possibility that a good portion of my savings is not in my sole control.
I don't think that setting up a wallet in Electrum is that difficult, but there are mobile wallets which simplify things even more. Getting a bank account and a credit card is **so much more** difficult, it's just that you have a smiling assistant sitting there to give an impression of smoothness. Be that assistant to your Dad if needed be.
**AND PLEASE, DON'T EVER DISCLOSE PUBLICLY OR SEMI-PUBLICLY HOW MUCH CRYPTOCURRENCY YOU OWN, EVEN IF THIS IS A DISPOSABLE ACCOUNT AND YOU ARE FROM TOR. THIS THING BECAME VERY FASHIONABLE HERE LATELY. THIS IS NOT A COMPETITION OR A ONE-UP GAME, YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE ANY ADVERSARY FURTHER CUES TO TRACK YOU AND YOUR FUNDS. If I were you, I'd edit the original post to exclude these data.**
@_date: 2017-02-03 21:06:03
It 's not "instant" in the sense that you say. You have to verify your credit card and also your identity, I think they will be done with that in a day or two. After that, there are no other steps.

I can understand that. But don't worry - there are many extremely smart women in the bitcoin space. M. K. Lords, Julia Tourianski, Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof, Stephanie Murphy, Tatiana Moroz, Blythe Masters, Amanda B.

Guys, stop announcing how much BTC you bought and for LIFE'S SAKE, don't provide direct tx info to it. The system makes sense when it's as anonymous as possible. When this stash will be worth hundreds of thousands and dollars and the authorities will have state of the art blockchain analysis tools, your savings and life will be in danger.

True, Masters is not in the freedom-minded camp. But at least she does understand the technology level of the blockchain, even though she is approaching it from a regulator-friendly end. Her private blockchain project (Hyperledger) is open-source and I don't necessarily have a problem if a company chooses a private blockchain for certain solutions.
This is not to say I vouch for private blockchains; I see little chance that they will succeed anyway. They will learn through their own mistakes why private blockchains won't work for solving high-stake problems. Neither do I support Masters's political agenda in ANY way - regulation, KYC and such. I included her due to her competence, which is clearly not there in the case of Perianne Boring.

Usually, a mining pool's contributors get a share of the block rewards and the fees in proportion to their contributed hashpower. The mining poll operators obviously has their own income thorough percentages from the above income, I guess they paid it back from that. (Makes more sense than asking for x mBTC from every miner.)

Cheap electricity and capital it does.
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:14:54
This doesn't show which chain each pool is on, or what ratio of their hashrate is directed to which chain.

Thank you for the quick answer!
Do you think that this will stay this way? Is it the main obstacle that Electrum chose to pair the native SegWit (bech32) address type with their native wallets? I mean, if a derivation path would be established for BIP173 (i don't know if that's possible, but Electrum probably uses *some* derivation path to generate bech32 addresses), then could the process be similar to the one you introduced above?
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:47:44
Thanks! Any ideas on how to create a bech32-address wallet from a BIP39 seed in Electrum? Does that have a derivation path? Because i couldn't find one in the BIP173 specification.

Or just don't use wallets from incompetent companies who have shown distaste towards crypo's trustless nature before.

"Trustless" is indeed not a well-definable term and can mean different degrees of trustlessness. Even on the Bitcoin blockchain I trust that nodes will relay my transaction, that at least one miner will try to include it in a block, and that others will accept that block as canonical and build on it. When the degree of reliance on one single party is small enough that it becomes irrelevant, and the set of these parties is open for anyone to join and try to compete, I consider that trustless.
All decentralized public blockchains rely on game-theoretic assumptions. Indeed, Cosmos and Plasma have not yet been tested with real value at stake. I mentioned them because they are the most probable to realize trustless sidechain technology the soonest. I don't see where Strong Federations involve reliable game-theoretic guarantees.


Right, that sounds reasonable.
If Liquid tries to contest e.g. Hyperledger or Corda -- the commercial blockchain space -- I see that as a good positioning. Blockstream exploiting them being associated with Bitcoin Core, and marketing Liquid with Bitcoin is, however, malicious and can be even harmful.
@_date: 2018-07-05 00:59:54
You're right in that I didn't word my comment properly. I wanted to write cryptoeconomic punishability, some incentive that the protocol itself handles and not an external system which is much more dependent on the human factor.
The participants of a federation only have to agree between themselves about each others' membership. And if the membership make-up is successfully marketed to the public, then that's it, they won their trust. Don't think that even 5% of future users are able to verify the legal standing of these entities or know how to have legal recourse.
I loathe this Eos-esque narrative that somehow legal jurisdiction will ensure that nodes will behave honestly. Choosing jurisdictions where enforcement can be evaded is something these very entities specialize in (e.g. Crypto Capital Corp, Bitfinex, Binance), because crypto companies in general had to learn to escape enforcement, regardless whether they are good-willed or malicious. Also, recourse may be impossible. Companies can be shut down, people can be arrested, but if a threshold number federation signatures abscond with 10,000 BTC, then that's 10,000 BTC stolen forever and there is nothing that can undo that.
Moreover, this is dead against the idea of external censorship-resistance. If you build on these suppositions of legal reach and authority, then federation members can also be adversely affected by the whim of legal jurisdiction. What is the FATF or the recently formed tax supergroup J5 decide that Liquid is used for money laundering, and they force entities to comply in handing over keys? All the BTC in the root chain multisig will be gone, not to talk about the value that lived on the sidechain. The fact that these entities will be publicly known makes them very vulnerable to any kind of attacker.
Marketing all this as "backed by Bitcoin" is irresponsible. In this regard, Liquid is like a number of exchanges coming together and running a database. You don't really need a blockchain for this, and positioning it in the public with the blockchain element creates a false impression of security in the user.
Sidechains/pegging are trustlessly safe if
* the sidechain can provide the security of the root chain (see [Plasma]( (but for something like that, you need massive protocol changes in Bitcoin, which is a far cry, just see how SegWit wars went),
* or if the validator set remains open, and validators have a stake to lose (see [Cosmos]( validators).
@_date: 2018-07-03 17:28:39


This is false. You are relying on trusted third parties (members of what's called the "Strong Federation") in differing degrees:
"The Liquid Network is operated by functionary servers, each securely hosted by geographically dispersed, independently owned and operated Bitcoin exchanges."
( "How decentralized is Liquid?")
"In a  Strong  Federation,  functionaries  have  the  power  to  control the transfer of assets between blockchains and to enforce the consensus  rules  of  the  sidechain"
( II./B "Improving Sidechains with Strong Federations")
"... it replaces the dynamic  miner  set  with  a  fixed  signer  set ..."
( III./C "Achieving Consensus in Strong Federations")
"If a blocksigner suffers hardware failure, and cryptographic keys  are  not  recoverable,  the  entire  network  must  agree  to change signing rules to allow for a replacement blocksigner."
( VI./E "Hardware Failure")
"If enough  watchmen  collude,  they  can  overcome  the  multisig  threshold  and  confiscate  all  the  bitcoin  currently  in  the sidechain."
( VI./H "Confiscation of Locked Bitcoins")
**tl;dr: Neither consensus-formation, nor root (Bitcoin) chain asset handling is trustless on Liquid, and federation participants can't be punished for any malicious behavior. Liquid isn't "Bitcoin-backed" in the sense [Blockstream makes]( most people believe: it doesn't inherit the security of the root chain.**

You are a defeatist scum who tries to win an argument via presenting a false dialectic, projecting a "lesser of two evils". You draw the picture like there is something wrong and broken in Bitcoin. From the perspective of your area of focus, there is zero problem with Bitcoin. The problem is you, the subservient and implicitly threatening mindset you operate on.
