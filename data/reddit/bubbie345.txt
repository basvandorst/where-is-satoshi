Coinbase is a very popular exchange app/website for beginners and the minimum limit you can buy is $1.99 worth. I recommend it!
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:39:09
No shit 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:09:13
I suggest Bitcoin cash for a coward like you

Calling anyone who is against trump basically a pussy definitely makes you a coward. This isn’t about bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:41:38
But if they can afford to invest for you why wouldn’t they just keep it for themselves since it’s their money?
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:32:30
You expect us to take the risk while you reap the rewards? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 08:03:59
Holy shit he's mad! Lol well he's certainly not An expert in Bitcoin

It will be a scenario like we are seeing in Venezuela and Zimbabwe where it costs 1 thousand dollars to buy a gallon of milk 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:00:07
25% give or take 
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:09:25
Coinbase currently needs a purchaser to be 18 to buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:02:28
We use Bitcoin to buy products??
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:06:38
You’re the 40th person to say it

Faux news*

I mean if you actually planned on only buying $2 worth, Bitcoin may not be your cup of tea as it is volatile but maybe you can turn that $2 into $100 one day if the price of Bitcoin skyrockets to $500,000.  The more you buy the fee becomes less and less of a percentage compared to your principle so I suggest investing a little more if possible. And with a $2 Investment, you're not gonna have many options unless you wanna accept the fee.

One of my favorite movies! " don't point at it, don't even look at the guitar"
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:54:09
Nope! The closer you get to an object it appears bigger. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:02:43
Amateur mistake! You should have had a diamond wallet for your bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:04:48
All you can reasonably afford. While it may be only showing growth as of now, the future remains to be seen. It is still an investment and should be treated as such 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:29:17
Passes to the man and boom goes the dynamite!

 Got my $10 worth of Bitcoin from Coinbase in about 5 minutes after I bought the $100 worth
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:06:54
The tastiest Cryptocurrency in all the world!

I guarantee he's never gonna have another slice lol!
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:09:17
I hope it stays missing! More value per coin that way!
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:09:55
My advice is buy $100 dollars worth. Not too little right now that it won't grow but not big enough to put a real dent into your savings if tomorrow it's all gone 
@_date: 2018-02-15 09:22:21
Besides the rampant prostitution and starvation, yes almost no ones in debt!

I’m not trying to be bitter, I think highly of India and wish to go there someday, I’m just trying to convey that a credit free society is infeasible
