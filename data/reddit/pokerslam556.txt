@_date: 2018-01-26 15:07:29
Lol I don't know. Only have been looking into this for a day. Also I'm just 19, never started a business in the past.
Tips/Resources are welcome tho. :)

Hahaha beast! Nice that your wife is into the plan :p
@_date: 2018-09-13 14:17:02
It means Bitcoin is here to stay and the trust is strong
@_date: 2018-09-05 06:06:48
So its on its all time high vs the Iran currency or vs usd? 
@_date: 2018-09-05 06:14:12
Also people who have the conversation where someone asks: When are you selling? And Im like never.. And they just cant get there mind to it. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 16:24:59
Hahaha I almost cant believe TA is giving going to 5k the highest likelihood. 5k.. Seems to good to be true. What a gift from god if we hit that number
@_date: 2018-09-11 18:44:29
They mine a lot of BTC tho, what can stop bitmain with that one thing? 
@_date: 2018-09-30 21:04:23
Yeah we need coinmarketcap and all exchnages listing satoshis. If people can buy x amount (like 1000+ satoshis for 1 euro or 5 or what ever. Bitcoin will go wild
@_date: 2018-05-05 22:50:16
Usd ha-ha scam coin.

He better shoves 5% of his net worth in to a short position. I would respect his statement then
@_date: 2018-05-05 14:47:03
Yes, you do not, the explosives shit is bs
@_date: 2018-05-16 11:48:05
Probably, but still he is right. Fuck the law. He never agreed to it
@_date: 2018-08-11 22:32:25
@_date: 2018-05-28 23:16:46
Uhm, so the banks can buy all the bitcoin and my friends and family get to work there asses off? No thnx, I will tell them.
@_date: 2018-05-19 15:43:41
Its in the middle, I see it
@_date: 2018-05-06 17:15:29
Lol had that too
@_date: 2018-05-05 10:13:21
Downvote. Fraudster is a big word. I'm on Bitcoin core for world currency but Roger has done a lot for the crypto space and you may not agree with how he is pushing Bitcoin cash now but in his mind that is probably the good thing to do for crypto. Calling him a Fraudster is just unrespectful.
@_date: 2018-05-05 10:52:11
You have no emphaty.
@_date: 2018-05-09 08:10:16
How drunk are you? We've gone over 9000 multiple times ;)

Why do country's leave there gold in america? 
@_date: 2018-05-05 10:09:18
After april, may it goes down again and makes a low in august. In 2013. Do not forget that. If history repeats, we have not seen the low yet and this will be just another bull trap.
@_date: 2018-05-11 22:37:43
I dont really care, he is right, it could happen
@_date: 2018-05-13 18:22:44
Yeah! Whooow! That's is what got me hooked on crypto. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 16:40:39
Okay, thnx!
@_date: 2018-05-05 10:22:28
I'm talking about comparing the charts, you can believe what you want..
@_date: 2018-05-20 11:25:32
Is this true? You couldnt buy tickets with bitcoin for the conference or for consensus? Wow.. that not good
@_date: 2018-05-05 10:41:08
Not saying that, you just can't call him a fraudster. Also people changed the idea of satoshi which he was a fan off since 2010. He also thinks core developers are shady motherfuckers
@_date: 2018-05-06 16:37:07
Crazy? For keeping 50% of your money in fiat, do you mean that?
@_date: 2018-05-18 12:09:15
Who said soon? 
@_date: 2019-03-31 22:57:03
All miners already know this. 
@_date: 2019-03-03 17:19:47
Does it matter? It may make people easier realize that it is real money. Not just magic weird shit on the internet
@_date: 2018-10-09 20:26:36
Jamie dimon, what a joke
@_date: 2018-10-10 13:40:19

Hahah this ya
@_date: 2018-10-15 09:55:54
If Tether dies, its a good lesson for all peope that want to buy BTC back lower. If you sell your Bitcoin and or dont hold it yourself. You are never sure if you will ever get it back. 
@_date: 2019-08-30 15:51:57
Was a good decision, you just had to buy the bitcoin from the money you normally spend on electricity then
@_date: 2018-06-01 19:49:20
You are going to get insanely rich my friend
@_date: 2018-06-11 15:25:51
I hope you will get rich quick! When you cash out in 1 year and put it back in to your bank account. I will get another 10x from that point.. while your fiat will deflate more then 50%. "Lose whealth fast" your new motto
@_date: 2019-02-08 20:29:52
Hyperwave Tyler says Gold is most likely the outcome. But bitcoin is a good bet and he hopes Bitcoin will be the solution. 
@_date: 2019-02-08 20:32:45
A woman in the bitcoin reddit. This is adoption. Bull run confirmed. 
@_date: 2019-02-07 15:39:29
Anyone else that just not believes these transactions are real? I mean everyone was sending bitcoin in my environment, now no one is anymore. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 11:25:55
Get some hookers man
@_date: 2018-11-21 14:55:55
You do something for the coin. The supply gets smaller, so if others want to buy it more scarce. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:58:46
And this is why blockchain and crypto will 90+% sure happen. AT SOME TIME. May be 100 years, (probably not) but it will.
@_date: 2019-01-31 18:59:11
True also have seen it multiple times now!
@_date: 2019-01-07 00:44:50
Btc won! The flag is out! 
@_date: 2019-01-17 16:03:45
Fck yeah, we got more orange 
@_date: 2019-01-17 12:44:14
No one is transacting with it, its just that fees are low that people send transactions to make it look like it is being used. 
@_date: 2019-01-07 15:54:57
Could the girl not have a orange hat with bitcoin on it? Edit: Sorry, seems negative reaction. It surely is beautiful! Love it.

@_date: 2018-02-23 00:18:01
I was expecting number one comment: "fuck you!" But this one is beautiful��
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:28:20
So this is what came out? Or is there still a live webcast today?
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:53:21

Bro, she is a keeperrrrr.
@_date: 2018-04-26 18:57:25
For all people saying Nick Szabo is satoshi, he is not. If he was he would never retweet anything like this. Satoshis is openminded and wanted the community to do its own thing. He would not critises bitcoin cash or an other fork. So than that is out of the way.
@_date: 2018-04-17 22:03:11
I'm not concerned. It is just a good way to get adoption.
@_date: 2018-04-04 23:13:46
Beautiful chart
@_date: 2018-04-25 09:49:22
Yeah most people dont see that. But lets talk about 1 million of purchase value.
@_date: 2018-04-26 15:22:12
The day all bitcoins are mined will be a celebrationday in the entire world. Would like to be there.. drink some beers, spend some satoshis. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 22:04:55
Hmm good point. We may not be ready yet. But lightning is coming!

Everyone says that about commercial breaks on television and still they work. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 22:09:41
Its not sure Verge can handle the volume bitcoin does / Mass adoption.
@_date: 2018-04-14 11:33:59
Thnx bot, you rock
@_date: 2018-04-21 09:15:48
No true because Tone Vays doesn't trade. He is to bussy with making content and just hodls.
@_date: 2018-04-25 10:58:44
I'm in for the bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-14 11:33:14
Why definetly did the 50:50 in January.

Good point from him.
@_date: 2018-04-25 10:11:36
Awesome bro! 
@_date: 2018-04-17 22:10:08
Who cares, the emblem is on the main page.
@_date: 2018-04-21 09:16:34
Over 9k doesnt mean we are not hitting 5k. We are not in the next bull run yet. We can say that around 13k or so
@_date: 2018-04-25 08:31:16
He gets that.. he just doesn't wants Bitcoin Cash to be an altcoin. It is the original Bitcoin because it uses the same idea of the original Bitcoin unlike bitcoin core. I'm not for Bitcoin Cash. I own mostly Bitcoin Core, and I like the way they are going. Just don't post delusional shit like this
@_date: 2018-04-24 10:50:03
If crypto goes 50x from here. Surely his money will protect him then.. He will be one of the riches people on earth. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 09:47:34
Fuck dollars, I'm not in for dollars.

Bro, I'm in. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 10:02:13
R/cryptocurrency is the same tho. Posted a discussion about if altcoins would multiply more then Bitcoin over 5 years. With some arguments for how the could and how not. Got downvoted to 0, If I do not post there favorite altcoin will go 100x they downvote you.
@_date: 2018-04-21 09:22:24
Because it is a game of odds. He said it could go up. There where just higher probability's to go down.
@_date: 2018-12-11 22:04:23
I start to believe logmarithmic growth is the only good long term indicator of price we have. 
@_date: 2019-05-09 13:19:49

What there are two bitcoins? 
@_date: 2018-12-03 09:08:15
Was this last year? 
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:54:18
Ya but some tech analysers say it can go lower for sure. I mean 1.2k is a good point of resistance for sure. (previous high) nothing is keeping us from getting there. Ofcourse 1000 reasons for never hitting that point. I realize that we can go as low as that because Bitcoin is an Asset as of now. We as bulls find this hard to realize, I bought a lot at 14k for the longterm, I thought it would crash but who cares, its going to 300k right!?
