not to be confused with fdc42aedd18cO3f10f8d5a842a4513cf05f7fe20 or fdc42aedd18c03f10f8d5a842a4513cfO5f7fe20 or fdc42aedd18c03f10f8d5a842a4513cf05f7fe2O or

it's not a good one, because it's not true. 
i live in ukraine, have an account with a ukrainian bank, use my credit card on a regular basis in cafes, supermarkets, shops, online, etc, and never have problems buying something with my credit card from ukrainian or international companies. 
the only problem i've had is when i made a larger than usual payment from outside ukraine, and my bank phoned me up to check if it was me using my card. a pretty cool bit of anti-fraud security on their part.
what is interesting is the similarity between the performance of bitcoin and the hrivna in 2014. 
here's the performance of the hrivna against the dollar this year. almost 40% decline.
 
and here's the performance of bitcoin against the dollar this year. also down almost 40%.
 
the hrivna is the worst performing currency on the planet this year so far, and bitcoin mirrors it! there are machines where you can buy bitcoins everywhere, yet no one is buying them because they charge 8% fees. why should i change my hrivna into bitcoin, at a cost of 8% when it's doing equally as badly?
tldr: my ukrainian credit card works fine for buying stuff in ukraine and internationally.

"Let's start with the basic fact: Nobody listens to sales pitches. (Do you listen to them? I don't. Especially if they are coming from some bozo I just met.)
To make matters worse, when most entrepreneurs give their "elevator pitch," they talk really, really fast so as to cram as much as information as possible into a short a time as possible.
In professional sales, this is known as the "spray and pray" method. It's not only ineffective, but it's irritating–especially if your listener didn't sign up for an information dump."

where does the money they raised go if there's any left over? they keep it. this seems to be the incentive.
this is actually quite a clever con. the 2 original students have found a new way to create a new bitcoin fundraising scam. raise half a million dollars promising to give it out to "**every** undergraduate student", then quietly announce it as only available in an extremely short sign up period. a few people sign up to collect, and they pocket the rest. easy money!

@_date: 2014-06-06 09:41:02
you've misunderstood what i meant :)
all i meant was that it's easier to use sites in your 1st language to talk about anything, than to do it in a 2nd language. that's why Baidu has mainly speakers of chinese discussing issues relevant to them, reddit has mainly english speakers doing the same, and so on for vkontakte, etc...
it's not what they're talking about that matters - it's how they're doing it. i'm lucky in that i know russian and english, so i can read/discuss stuff in sites using english and russian, but a lot of people can't, so they stick with what they know, because it's easier.
in a world where everyone used the same language we could have a truly international forum for discussion, but at the moment we have what we have.

no they are not. ukraine is the name of the country. 'the ukraine' is incorrect, and has been for over 20 years.
"The Ukraine" is incorrect both grammatically and politically, says Oksana Kyzyma of the Embassy of Ukraine in London.
"Ukraine is both the conventional short and long name of the country," she says. "This name is stated in the Ukrainian Declaration of Independence and Constitution."
We may conclude then, that the use of the definite article in English before the name Ukraine is awkward, incorrect and superfluous. Writers who care about good style in their English grammar and the correctness of their language will always avoid the use of "the Ukraine" and use only the simpler and correct "Ukraine."

you've got 3 choices really.
1: hire a large empty factory, fill it with about 3,000 machines and some industrial ventilation fans, pay $50,000 a month for electricity, and profit.
2: build mining rigs, accept thousands of prepaid eorders, but don't send them out, repeat step 1, profit.

If it gets increasingly more expensive to mine them, and people think it's worth paying an increasingly higher price for them because of scarcity - yes. If people gradually lose interest because they have no need for them - no.
When i first got interested in bitcoin in 2013 the main selling points were free and instant transactions, be your own bank, micro payments, cut out the middle man, and a store of value.
Looking at what there is now, transactions aren't free or instant, people don't want to go through the hassle of being a bank, micro transactions failed, and to actually use bitcoin a middle man is very common. 
so all that is left as a selling point is as a store of value, which is why this sub works itself into a frenzy every time the price rises. This attracts new people who buy in high, become new hodlers, and wait for the next bubble.
@_date: 2016-06-06 18:26:16
I understand it very well. OP made a broad disingenuous statement about value. I responded in kind.
To be precise then, if i had got 1 bitcoin at it's peak in December 2013 ($1124 as per OP's post) it would now have a value of $586. A loss of $538 (plus fees and service charges).
If i had got $1124 in December 2013 it would now have a value of $1108. A loss of $16 (plus service charges).
I would have lost almost half my investment going by OP's parameters, as opposed to the cost of a cinema ticket if i'd bought the equivalent in dollars.
that better?

So I find the thing I want on Amazon, contact someone with a gift card. They buy the thing I want. I convert dollars to bitcoin, send them bitcoin. They send me the thing and convert the bitcoin back to dollars.
Or, and maybe this is just crazy, I click pay on amazon and get the thing I want the next day, without the extra layers of Bullshit.

this is so stupid it makes my head hurt.
I live in Ukraine, and like everyone here, convert my savings into a stable currency like pounds, euros, or dollars. 
if i'd bought 1 bitcoin at the height of the 2013 bubble and sold it today i'd be down $400, plus money for fees, service charges, and wallet. 
if i'd bought $1000 dollars i'd still have $1000.
this is the comparison that people here make when looking to invest.

How many miners and people that get paid in bitcoin are there do you think?
Then, how many of them will buy stuff using the purse app from Amazon?
Is that final number anywhere near the 2.3 billion figure in this article?
If yes, then this article is a great description of the current situation.
I'd no, then it's just another over exaggerated meaningless clickbait title that sounds great, but actually only applies to a very small number of people.

I live in Ukraine, one of the countries in OP's list, and get paid in Hrivna. I'm one of the 1 billion people OP is talking about. 
In reality no one in Ukraine keeps Hrivna as savings because of the economic collapse. I, like everyone here, convert my savings into a stable currency like pounds, euros, or dollars, and as a result have lost a slight amount from the depreciation of their value. 
Ironically, the Hrivna's collapse happened during the same time as the bubble in bitcoin's value. I had a choice to invest in bitcoins or one of the above mentioned currencies and, luckily for me it now seems, I chose pounds. If i had bought bitcoins i would have lost half my savings.
@_date: 2017-01-15 06:21:30
Nah. Capping the number of bitcoin at 21 million to create artificial scarcity is the cause, and is also why no one wants to spend them. HODL exists as a thing in bitcoin for precisely this reason. Most holders of bitcoin do it because they think they're going to be worth a fortune in the future. It's against their interest to spend them
Traditional currencies like the pound, dollar, etc.. are inflationary and lose value over time and so people use them on a daily basis because it's in their interest to do so.
@_date: 2016-06-06 14:25:08
I have no idea. just giving you a perspective from a real person in Ukraine who gets paid in the local currency, and why it was a better investment for me to buy pounds in 2013/4 as opposed to bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-08-12 23:16:27
this is hilariously out of touch with reality it's painful.
I live in Ukraine. are you interested in buying any Ukrainian hrivna? of course not. since the revolution in december 2013, and then the war, it's lost 60% of it's value.
am I interested in buying bitcoin? of course not. in the same time period it's lost 60% of it's value.
from a ukrainian perspective over the last year and a half bitcoin has been literally as bad an investment as the hrivna. the only thing that's kept anything near its value is the dollar, so that's what people here (and the other countries you mentioned) are buying. 
@_date: 2015-08-13 07:20:52
ummmmmm okay... except that has no bearing on the real world i live in. 
at the beginning of the ukrainian economic crisis in deember 2013 it cost me 8 hrivnas to buy 1 dollar, now it costs 24. it's depreciated to a third of its value in the last year 18 months. 
it would have cost me $900 to buy 1 bitcoin, now it's $265. it's depreciated to a third of its value in the last year 18 months. 
so, since the crisis started here in december 2013:
if i had bought dollars/euros in november 2013 they would still be about the same value now.
if i had held hrivnas they would have lost 66% of their value
if i had bought bitcoin they would have lost 70% (plus fees for converting)
that is the reality i live in, and also why ukrainians aren't buying bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-07-28 17:25:38
no. it's just the designated name that is officially used, and has been for over 20 years. 
the official name on maps in english is 'the united states of america', in the same way the official name on maps is 'ukraine'.

um no.
it's pseudo science waffle based on wild speculation.

@_date: 2015-07-28 07:21:27
bitcoin is a very bad idea from a ukrainian perspective
when it all started in december 2013 there were various options: hold the hrivna, buy dollars/euros, buy bitcoins, etc..
say i had 10,000 hrivnas
if i had bought dollars/euros they would still be about the same value now. 
if i had held hrivnas they would have lost 66% of their value 
if i had bought bitcoin they would have lost 70% (plus fees for converting)
basically ukraine's economy has tanked, along with the value of its currency, but in the same period the value of bitcoin has performed equally as badly.
this is also the reason why other countries going through the same shit don't all rush to buy bitcoins. for someone looking to put their money in a safe place, bitcoin is very unattractive.

i've been interested in, and following bitcoin developments here and in other forums since 2013. i find it fascinating, but there's also a lot of hyperbole and disinformation that goes along with it.
i'm in this particular thread because every now and then for the last year there's been a topic about Ukraine, where either these terminals are heralded as somehow leading to mass adoption here, or somehow the whole country is going to suddenly transfer all their money over to bitcoins. this is normally accompanied with phrases with phrases like 'this is huge!', and 'Whoa!!! Crazy!'. It makes me feel like a lab rat, or an animal in a zoo, with people looking in at 'the exotic' poor people who are going to all leap onto the bitcoin band wagon shouting 'this is gentlemen!'.
here are the exact same terminals in a topic 1 year ago (i've actually had one right outside my flat for the last year :)
and the 5 months ago classic 'bitcoin will change Ukraine forever'
so when i saw the title "Wow Go Ukraine!!! Is that over 9,000? The whole country now has access to Bitcoin" i had a bit of a chuckle because, as the another guy who lives in Ukraine posting here said above, the bitcoin community here is a "really tiny minority". and he promotes and uses bitcoins on a regular basis. nothing has changed in the bitcoin sphere in Ukraine, and these terminals have been up and running for over a year. since the economic collapse no one except the super rich have any spare money to buy anything except the essentials. basically, OP's post is a non-story, but appears exciting if you don't know this.
the thing that really blows my mind is that even though at one point the Ukrainian Hrivna was the worst performing currency on the planet, it has since recovered stability. this means if I had brought dollars, Hrivna, and bitcoins at the start of the economic collapse the biggest loss for me would be from bitcoins, and the safest bet dollars. this is the same calculation people here make, and explains why dollars are the most popular currency for saving in Ukraine.
no one really knows where the bitcoin experiment is going, but living through war and economic collapse has certainly sharpened my real world knowledge of how mass adoption of bitcoin as a currency in countries suffering economic crisis is not going to happen. 
this is what goes through my mind every time i see this kind of post
Why are you here?
@_date: 2015-09-15 19:16:51
@_date: 2015-09-28 20:23:01
someone who actually lives in Ukraine here.
these terminals have been around for a while. they have a multiple options for different payments for gas, electricity, phone credit, crypto currency, etc... the thing is they are used mainly for paying bills and phone credits. 
no one is buying bitcoins from them. the mark up is too high, and bitcoin is a terrible alternative to the dollar for Ukrainians.
to show you what i mean 
at the beginning of the ukrainian economic crisis in december 2013 it cost me 8 hrivnas to buy 1 dollar, now it costs 24. it's depreciated to a third of its value in the last year 18 months.
in december 2013 it would have cost me $900 to buy 1 bitcoin, now it's $238. it's depreciated to a third of its value in the last year 18 months.
so, since the crisis started here in december 2013:
if i had bought dollars/euros in november 2013 they would still be about the same value now.
if i had held hrivnas they would have lost 2 thirds of their value
if i had bought bitcoin they would have lost 2 thirds of their value (plus fees for converting)
that is the reality i live in, and also why ukrainians aren't buying bitcoins.

so this sub is only for people enthusiastic about bitcoin? i was under the impression " is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem."
we had a revolution here in the winter of 2013, followed by russia annexing crimea, followed by war. these events created and worsened the financial crisis in ukraine. i've lost most of my savings from devaluation, and get paid in Hrivna, so now get a third of what i used to, while prices have doubled. this is why that date is the start point for comparison, because the collapse of the hrivna coincidentally ran in parallel with the collapse of the price of bitcoin. sorry if that is a "a silly contrived example".
and yes, everybody has lost here, except for the super rich. that's what happens when a currency collapses in a country. i hope you never have to experience it - it's very depressing.
