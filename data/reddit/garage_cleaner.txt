A 2% inflation rate may doom them due to the resulting necessary increase in bond yields. Japan's current debt is 200% of GDP, and with their deflation resulting in -1% inflation yearly, even a 1% yield on their bond rates, gives a net 2% yield. Increasing inflation to 2% would require a 4% bond yield to match the net yield it currently has. That level of increase pushes japan very close to defaulting on their loans when they currently use over 20% of their revenue just on debt repayment. 
Japan's debt is at $80,000 per person, their debt makes Italy look stable. Their economic state is actually far more dire than you realize. 2% is nothing compared to historical trends, which dictate an average of 3%, but that rate would possibly ruin japan.

Its true that miners did not come up, nor did much on how bitcoins are secured, anonymous, etc. It's just a something that introduces people who can barely grasp how QE massively distorts our currency, how something that happens in Cyprus affects the world economy and makes things like bitcoins very viable. A lot of people out there have very little understanding of the monetary process, like how the secrete service not only protects the president, but also protects our currency from counterfeiting.
Its like the Dunning-Kruger affects, but the knowledgeable are so confident that most people have a base knowledge, but really most people are pretty clueless. I'm starting pretty low brow, but really, I can't even convince people I know to go on reddit.

It's actually very terrible already, when the yen was trading as low in 78 to a dollar, most Japanese companies were losing money. It's already doubly horribly that they have no choice but to make bold moves because they already have public debt on the order of $70,000 per citizen! They bailed out banks on bad housing bets during the 80's, deemed everyone too big to fail, the propped municipalities that were bankrupt. Japan's economy is pretty FUBAR, despite the relative strength of their currency. I have a feeling this round of abenomics will not end well.

I believe in bitcoins, and I'm pretty decent on the concept of it and a bit of the economic side, but fuck this shit prevents me from really diving in. I need to get schooled in a bit of Linux, for printing out my paper backups, and get a dedicated offline cheapo computer and printer. Also, I need more info on truecrypt. This should be on the FAQ, how to not get fucked using bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:20:15
Maybe, if you look towards Japan, which has been suffering from over a decade of deflation, its a terrible thing as they have an export driven economy. When the yen is strong and they sell goods overseas they receive less money due to the relative weakness of foreign currency. This drags on the economy as business' cannot stay profitable in this environment. This leads to economic contraction, people fearful of job security hoard their money, delay purchases, etc. Its really how strong currencies affect economies, its not really analogous to bitcoins IMO.
Bitcoin is not a nation, there are no exports to worry about, but it is a currency in its infancy. However, in a way this run away valuation may be good for it, as businesses see the relative strength of bitcoins it makes them more apt to adopt it. The more people become interested in bitcoins, the more they wish to buy into it. As it reaches a certain level of ubiquity, prices should begin to stabilize. There are other factors that may cause some major contractions,  e.g. the UK bans its use, but for the most part I feel that this exposure is good for the community.  However, if people don't spend their bitcoins and business' begin to see adopting it as a waste, then maybe it will all collapse, those who bought in as an investment pull out and it all falls to shit. 
Tl;dr Maybe, but i don't think deflation is the apt term for what is happening to bitcoins.
edit: I can't grammar.

However, wouldn't you agree that utilizing craigslist would demonstrate the interest and people's willingness to trade goods for bitcoin similarly to any other currency? It would also demonstrate that this is unlike credit cards and that any person can obtain and utilize some. It gives potential to change the business model and decrease reliance on third party online payment endors such as paypal or the use of credit cards.
I think it's an aspect that can be highlighted.

For a political scientist, you're not up to speed on much are you? Either search abenomics or Japan QE and you will find they are about to begin a $1.4 TRILLION release of Yen to DOUBLE their monetary supply. So, yeah this isn't some tin foil craziness, this is some major economic intervention. If you're really a political scientist, you'd also know that Japan has suffed from nearly continuous deflation for over a decade and the writing was on the wall that something major was going to be done with Abe back as PM.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:59:46
In terms of Japan, deflation is terrible because its makes the yen strong relative to other currencies. As a net exporter that means they get less profit form oversea sales, which drives their economy. Thus, the insanly massive QE planned.

Better yet, imagine you want to open a business. You buy your inventory and price it accordingly. No one wants to spend because their money is only increasing in value. People do not spend, you drop the price of your goods, still no one buys. Suddenly, you're bankrupt and can't pay back your loan. The bank now is out even more money, because the currency has strengthen and each dollar loaned out a year ago, is now equivalent to a $1.50!  Banks are sitting on tons of bad debt, businesses are going bankrupt, people lose jobs, economy is in the shitter. 
People only buy what they need, they delay purchases like homes, starting businesses, buying cars etc. The economy stalls, joblessness increases, more insecurity, more savings, and its a vicious cycle. 
Why would countries wish to adopt this type of currency? Look to Japan for the past two decades.

It's also kind of dick for the store to chain rates to a market that has frozen trades for the next ten hours. Actually, I'm only certain that bitmit does this, if others average a market aggregate, then it's a dick move on the customers.

I'm unsure why you didn't want to utilize craigslist more. I don't think it's cheating when you advertise something you want and find people who are willing to accept bitcoin. You seem wary of "cheating" a lot.
I think this may be a good plan for a place to stay seeing as this is how many people actually find places to rent and would not be out of the norm. Also, for temporarily renting a car/bike/ mode of transportaion for a week, I'd use craigslist.

I agree that "miners" provide so much more, they provide the infrastructure that confirm transactions. It's imprecise because without gold miners we could still use the gold that is above ground, but without bitcoin miners transactions could not be confirmed. It's imprecise but the closest thing that I can think of are like stock exchanges that provide infrastructure for exchanges.  That in itself may be hard for lay people to comprehend.
It's sometimes difficult to dumb things down without losing the essence of what you want to convey...but I never doubt the ignorance of my fellow humans.

I'll help you out guy. If you're in blockchain.info and have made a wallet, then you should have an address, you could've copy pasted your address once you had access to the recalescence coin wallet via the send money tab. It's rather quick.
As a note I didn't get it because macs blow and didn't allow the blockchain QR code feature to work. Missed it by thirty seconds as I had access and then got confirmation the coins had been spent as I was about to send via MANUALLY typing it in. Apple really blows when it comes to bitcoins :(

At the very least, I hope you were a miner or early adopter and really just "lost" unrealized profits. It happens, the money was never really real because you never cashed out.

I usually never get this far, as people are like, "oh, so you're buying this stuff now." And then when I say, "Well, not yet" it kind of ends it and I feel awkward and weird. Either that or they say "We'll, it's not like people use gold now." 
You could explain hashing like this, like gold, hashes are buried in rock, you have to brute force go through a lot of rock and mud to find a hash, which is like an unrefined piece of gold. After time and effort, which costs money, they come out in these blocks of bitcoins. That seems understandable, right?
