Well, to look on the bright side, this hack shows we have capacity for several more thousand transactions per day.

This is SICK! Love everything about it, make it a poster and I'm buying :)

This is a great observation!  The kids today who are using faucets and saving small tips will have a significant amount of BTC when they reach retirement age.  I wonder what effect this will have on the attitudes towards saving money on future generations.  Clearly, the debt based economy today has made current generations have very little concept of why it is good to save for the future.  
@_date: 2015-12-12 23:09:57
You're right. I made the projections more conservative since we do not know what future difficulty increases will look like.  In all likelihood, we will see these block rewards a few years earlier than predicted.  
@_date: 2015-12-13 02:22:14
Because the software the miners are running is hard coded to say if block number = x, then reward = y.  If a mining pool released a version that broke this code, they would fork from the network and none of the blocks they solve would be valid to the rest of the network.  The miners themselves would break away from this pool and join other pools who are part of the consensus.  It's important to realize that individual miners are in far greater numbers than the number of pools, and so it isn't a matter of the pool operators colluding.  It would be the pool operators convincing thousands of miners into making a change against the interests of the greater bitcoin ecosystem.

If you take the decimals out far enough, you're right, it will never reach 21,000,000.

This looks interesting. I would buy one for sure.  For those who want to go straight to the product, it's:

Along the same vein, if anyone is interested in purchasing a copy of the Wired Nov. 2011 magazine with ["The Rise and Fall of Bitcoin"]( article, let me know.  I have a few copies that are still new and sealed in the original plastic.  
I'd also be willing to part with 1-2 of the famous [2014 Newsweek]( with Satoshi Nakamoto on the cover. These are hard to come by and are also new and sealed in plastic.

On one hand I can see what you are saying, but on the other I think we might be considered like people who invested heavily in tech stocks during the 90's.  People did not look at the tech millionaires/billionaires with disdain, and certainly not pariahs. Instead they gladly made them rich by buying up as many PC's, software, and gadgets as possible.  
Just because someone is late to the table doesn't mean they won't happily join the party.

Define SHTF. In a world where Bitcoin is the dominant currency, it means 190+ countries accept it.  I don't see a scenario where it's lights out internet for the entire world. Life will still be going on, *somewhere*.  You can just go there, and enjoy the benefits of a global, ubiquitous currency which requires no concept of moving money in and out of a specific geographic locale.  As long as you have the means to travel to a place that is not currently having shit hitting the fan, people will still be doing commerce, on the blockchain, with no trouble.
@_date: 2015-07-24 00:03:19
Bitcoin almost died but the blockchain really saved its ass.  
@_date: 2015-07-20 21:01:30
Yeah but anyone who signed up as a novelty just to see what the fuss was about could also be implicated here.  
@_date: 2015-11-25 12:20:48
They do, and that's what I'm using. It's called the [Multisig Vault](   
I own the Trezor and Ledger, but it's the Coinbase multisig with 48 hr time lock that lets me sleep at night.  Once Trezor or another wallet gets this, they'll probably get me to switch.  
@_date: 2015-11-25 20:13:38
Again, I'm not claiming them to be doing anything unfairly. I have a lot of respect for Pieter and Greg, as I do for anyone who is contributing to core. You're taking these comments as insults to their character when I am only pointing out there are unanswered questions with regards to the funding of Blockstream and it *may* result in some conflict of interest given their influence on core protocol decisions.   
With regard to Gavin, yes MIT is large but he is salaried and I don't see any profit motive for him to be swayed in any direction. The same is not true for, as you said, Pieter and Greg "starting a for-profit company for themselves".  Do you not see the difference?  Even if you don't, do you not see how others might see a distinction?  Again (and I'll say this because you have twice now put words in my mouth), **I am not accusing them of having done anything to hold bitcoin back**.
You have twice now redirected this debate to discuss my personal qualifications and how unqualified I am to discuss this. Frankly it's irrelevant and quite funny considering it's from a 6 day old account whose entire existence on this site is filled with hostile comments around raising the block size.  
@_date: 2015-11-24 22:56:38
I won't move them out of Coinbase until another wallet service has something like the Vault's 48 hour time lock.

That would only be true if Core chose to do nothing in response to overwhelming support of XT. The new Bitcoin would still be the old Bitcoin if only they implemented BIP 101.  Many people who switched to XT in protest of small blocks would likely switch back to Core in this scenario.  


I agree, and I think the discussion we are having is an example of that. We can disagree but still be civil.


Glad we see eye to eye on that. Cheers.  
@_date: 2015-11-25 18:23:44
Not to add fuel to the fire, but it is non-neutral to say XT is an altcoin.  
I'm not really on any side in the debate, but calling it an altcoin and censoring the discussion across the entire subreddit was infuriating to me and many others.  It intentionally disregards the consensus requirements that would need to be reached to diverge from core.  
By the way, nothing about bitcoin is neutral. Bitcoin, at it's very essence, is powerfully disruptive and evokes many emotions from it's supporters and detractors.  I think it's crazy to expect that everyone be neutral and polite when it comes to something like this.  We need sensible moderation that understand this, not censorship.  
@_date: 2015-11-25 12:32:46
The funding source is much more relevant than other startups because Blockstream's team has the capability to change the Bitcoin protocol.  
If my business was set to become significantly disrupted by Bitcoin, and I wanted to delay or mitigate that risk, the path of least resistance would be to gain control of the intellectual property within the development team. 
Other options to undermine Bitcoin such as trying to gain significant hash power to alter block generation or acquire a ton of coins to manipulate the market has less long term consequences than controlling the code base (not that they wouldn't be attacking on these fronts, also).  
@_date: 2015-11-25 15:49:01
Bruce, while you are technically correct, what are the odds that a BIP that Pieter and Greg disapprove of will make its way into Bitcoin Core?  The average person has about as much a chance getting a change into Bitcoin Core as he does getting his congressman to pass an amendment to the constitution.  
@_date: 2015-11-25 17:33:12
Nope, Multisig has the 48 hour time lock just like the regular vault.  I don't know of any other option for multisig unless they've changed the configuration.  
@_date: 2015-11-25 01:18:28
No. Sorry, but no.  Type a couple extra digits and your coins could be locked for decades.  
@_date: 2015-11-25 17:49:56
I have not suggested they have censored anything.  I'm just pointing out that they wield a significant amount of influence over anything getting into core. There are only a handful of people with this kind of influence, and at least two of them are paid by Blockstream.  
I actually think having companies like Blockstream funding core development work is a great thing for bitcoin. But unlike with Gavin and the MIT initiative, the motives of the people funding blockstream are not well understood, hence this thread and the questions.
