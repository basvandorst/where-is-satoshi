It doesn’t matter whether or not it seems like a stretch or not, they’re throwing out a statement that could be complete bullshit. With a source, we can verify that it’s an actual fact and not a random redditor pulling numbers out of his ass

Currencies are a solution to the [coincidence of wants]( They’re a payment solution. Don’t argue semantics unless you understand the semantics you’re arguing

The dollar is a solution to payment

He’s also allegedly British (from linguistic analysis)
@_date: 2019-03-27 21:05:15
Okay, so explain to me how there is a greater payment solution than the dollar at work when I exchange $1 for a cup of lemonade?

Ross Ulbricht facilitated the sale, purchase, and distribution of controlled substances. While it sucks that they’re making an example of him the case IS pretty cut and dry

Big disagree, deflation takes a front seat. Token economics of any blockchain is one of the most critical aspects to consider.

Inflation is key to growing an economy, but inflation that is not transparent cannot be controlled. A cryptocurrency has a predictable inflation rate. I’m not necessarily saying DEFLATION is better, but I am saying that since the deflationary model is viewable in real time in Bitcoin whereas inflation isn’t with traditional fiat
@_date: 2019-02-10 17:11:48
I think that a single entity having total control over money printing w/o protocol or oversight is bad. I said the benefit is transparent inflation.

bch fork happened in August. We all knew the problem existed before the worst of it came
Edit: this subreddit is laughable. saying that bch exists isn’t endorsing it but y’all can’t even see that ticker without getting sad

“The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks” was embedded into the bitcoin genesis block. 
Bitcoin was created in the wake of a potential inability to trust the world’s reserve central currency.
Lehman brothers was one of the banks that was not bailed out.
