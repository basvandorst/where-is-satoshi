Not OP, but when I was like 13 or 14, I remember always being really proud of my ability to type words into chat sessions that were spelled the way you'd say them.  Woulda, gotta, gonna, etc etc.  
I was well-educated and didn't have a spelling problem, but in hindsight, I wonder if people just thought I was typing that way because I thought that was proper spelling.
It's possible OP likes being able to type the way he'd carry a conversation.

This hits a nail on the head that I feel like people have been turning a blind eye to lately.  
Sure, OP is now getting paid in a currency with way more fluctuation that (s)he normally would be paid in.
Sure, OP now had BTC instead of fiat, and that creates 'issues' when it comes time to spend.
But yeah - if nobody was on board with doing that stuff at a time when there's tumult and turmoil, then why would anyone expect the currency to survive?

It's way better than the roulette 'system'.
You put $5 on red.
If it hits red, take your $5 win and put it in your pocket, and put $5 on red.  KEep going.
If, OTOH, it's black, you double your bet.  Put $10 on red.
If it hits red, take your $5 profit and put it in your pocket, and put $5 on red.
But if, again, it's black, double the bet again.  Put $20 on red.
Keep doing it.  Eventually, red will come out  Take your $5, wipe the sweat away from your brow, and start over, or walk away.

Back when Cuban announced that he'd accept Bitcoin for ticket sales, the Bitcoin Twitter handle tipped him $25 of bitcoin cash.  Clearly this is precisely the sort of thing we can expect from an unregulated realm like this, but it does also seem to beg the question: If we're looking to use bitcoin and blockchain as a way of replacing currency, why would we think the ethical high road is preferable to the 'at all expenses' route, where the movement doesn't fall victim to things like this.  Yes, I know all the reasons it *should* work out to our favor, better a b c, stronger x y z, but like everything in a competition, you try to offset your weaknesses with your strengths.  If abc and xyz are our strengths, isn't the high road our weakness?

See below paste.
Shouldn’t you announce your goals, so friends can support you?
Isn’t it good networking to tell people about your upcoming projects?
Doesn’t the “law of attraction” mean you should state your intention, and visualize the goal as already yours?
Tests done since 1933 show that people who talk about their intentions are less likely to make them happen.
Announcing your plans to others satisfies your self-identity just enough that you’re less motivated to do the hard work needed.
In 1933, W. Mahler found that if a person announced the solution to a problem, and was acknowledged by others, it was now in the brain as a “social reality”, even if the solution hadn’t actually been achieved.
NYU psychology professor Peter Gollwitzer has been studying this since his 1982 book “Symbolic Self-Completion” (pdf article here) — and recently published results of new tests in a research article, “When Intentions Go Public: Does Social Reality Widen the Intention-Behavior Gap?”
Four different tests of 63 people found that those who kept their intentions private were more likely to achieve them than those who made them public and were acknowledged by others.
Once you’ve told people of your intentions, it gives you a “premature sense of completeness.”
You have “identity symbols” in your brain that make your self-image. Since both actions and talk create symbols in your brain, talking satisfies the brain enough that it “neglects the pursuit of further symbols.”
A related test found that success on one sub-goal (like eating healthy meals) reduced efforts on other important sub-goals (like going to the gym) for the same reason.
It may seem unnatural to keep your intentions and plans private, but try it. If you do tell a friend, make sure not to say it as a satisfaction (“I’m going to run a marathon!”), but as dissatisfaction (“I want to lose 20 pounds, so kick my ass if I don’t, OK?”)

While I don't disagree with your version, it's worth noting that there is a very broad spectrum when it comes to how people see things like $.  Earned, invested, found, etc.  Some people are able to stand on the side of the line where once the initial investment is returned, it's 'free money'.  Others - myself included - count every penny and dollar, not matter how it came to be ours.
To you his/her construct is false and artificial, but it works for him, because it's real - to him/her.

Of course you don't have to invest the money, but when the IRS sees you moving money onto an exchange and not investing it it is a flag.  If it doesn't conform to your previous years' behavior it's a flag.  If your money earns interest in your bank account for 7 years then you move it somewhere, the IRS will, understandably, ask itself 'why did they do that?'
None of what I'm saying equates to 'you're going to get audited if you ______.  And I didn't say that moving $ to an exchange will trigger an audit.  But the behavior, along with other things that you or your money do(es) or do(es) not will raise enough flags to cause an issue.
It's fine if you don't think I'm right, it's fine if you want to say I'm spreading misinformation.  I don't know what you're basing your statement on and I won't speculate as to whether it's anecdotal or insider knowledge.

This is great news because now only did I make money this month but I can also declare a loss on my taxes. 
This reads like a shittylifeprotip more than an actual explanation.

It is a scam from what you've described.  It was probably a sponsored result - that's really the only likely way it would be above other legit results.  
Report the ad to google, submit a ticket to Bittrex letting them know, and be happy you didn't get taken on this one.

That would be 1 way to do it.  You could also ask if anyone in your life wants it, withdraw from GDAX to a wallet, then give them the wallet.  GDAX won't charge you fees to pull it into a wallet as it stands today.

Doesn't matter if you've gained or lost - if you send a sizable amount to an exchange they can look at when you did it and decide if it makes sense to audit.
I'm not suggesting everyone's getting audited or there aren't whales being overlooked - I'm just saying that the potential ROI for having a keyboard jockey inputting some info to automate a process decision of audit vs ignore would seem to make it worthwhile.
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:47:32
I mean, yes and no it's sad that 10% haven't heard of it.  Keep in mind that many people aren't technically inclined, so asking them about a whitepaper would be like asking someone if they'd read the FAQ like 20 years ago.

This advice is good, if the 30K loss isn't something he can overcome.  
If it's an awful outcome, but doesn't make life undoable in terms of payments, support needs, etc, than not cashing out may not be the best.

This is exactly how the old penny stock spam worked.  Send an email to 1m people - half get a tip that it's going up, the other half that it's going down.  Then, resend to the group that you called it correct on - again, half saying up, half saying down.  Eventually, someone's going to believe that yo've got info since you've nailed 7/7 tips.  Then they do what you say, and you've bought into or sold out from whatever your next tip is.

Unless I'm misunderstanding something, you're only ever going to earn, proportionally, what you put in.  It's not as if being in a bigger pool gives you some perk, like access to otherwise-unavailable market pricing, or something otherwise unavailable to the masses trading BTC.

@_date: 2017-12-23 01:25:54
Hey - good to see someone trying to adopt it as a payment method.  I'm not an expert so someone else will have corrections or things to add, but here goes:
1) You'd need to do it with a QR code, but what you've described is as close to a workable version as I think you'll get as it stands today.
2) If you get 2.4% merchant account fees that's amazing!   And whether you accept BTC or not, most people will be paying with card.  Your accepting coin should be more about adopting and trying to further the movement, as opposed to being a matter of convenience or something else.  I mean, sure, it can also be an easy way to be accruing BTC on hand as investment, but that's up to you.  
As it stands, right now, depending on what your average sale amount would be, fees are higher than you'll be happy with.  I think.  That should change in, hopefully a few days - a few weeks, but that doesn't mean it's not going to happen again where the fees are higher than you'd like.  Lather, rinse, repeat this cycle (anyone agree?  Disagree?)
3) Now's not the best time to be asking that.  There are a lot of exchanges that people like / prefer.  Coinbase is one of the easiest to use, aside from pain in the ass verifications, support issues, etc.  At the end of the day it's fairly simple, but there are fees.  I would say go GDAX (owned by coinbase but not as fucky towards you on the fees), or Gemini, but I'm sure no matter what I answer someone's going to shove it down my throat while they scream 'reeeeeeeee'!
4) YMMV depending on numerous factors.  I wouldn't expect to have a scenario where you pull your money out for a short-notice, high-priority payment.  If you've plan in advance you shouldn't have issues getting money from an exchange to a bank account.  But again, remember, this is all in its infancy right now, so shit doesn't always work 100% of the time.  You might run into an issue, so don't expect no speed bumps, but don't be too surprised if you don't hit any either.
5) I'd say start simple for now.  Diversifying your coins should be up to you.  You're the businessman here - if a bunch of people start asking if you take 'x' other cryptocurrency, maybe consider starting to accept it?
6) You're going to need a screen showing people their price, and this - right here - can be the biggest problem you'll face.  Right now, this currency swings a few grand in a few hours on a heavy day.  I don't know how people are going to react - you included - if you are getting paid that much more or less than you (or your customers) intended.  Like I said, I just don't know how people will feel.  I'd say it's reasonable to use whatever the rate of the receiving exchange is.  For some customers they'll come out ahead, others behind.  But you're not going to stand and look at everybody's various exchanges' current rate, do the math, check over your shoulder thinking 'fuck man I don't wanna drop $4 on this'.  
7) Not me, but I'm hopeful someone else from your side of the table will offer more insight.
GOOD LUCK!  HAVE FUN!
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:35:35
Yes and no. It was worth a few grand more the day before yesterday. 
If you wanted to do this to do something, either sell t on an exchange and take your money back out, or find someone who wants to trade or do a direct sale of something. 
You can also search for vendors that accept bitcoin online and do something there.

They need to be able to audit who's doing what on their exchange.  Routing numbers on their own / paypal don't really link your identity to the transaction.

Depending on how you sell, yes.  Not to confuse you with things like market vs limit, but there's a way to effectively say 'I see you telling me 1  BTC = $x, so I am hereby selling you xBTC for that number of dollars.

1) No
2) It depends how you buy and cash out, so even more so - no.

Here's the thing - most people believe in the long-term payoff. 
Some are actively trading trying to hit highs and lows to make a bit on each side while waiting for the bigger payout, others have put what they can afford in and are now sitting, nervously waiting for it to shit or get off the pot. 
So what you've said about people's behavior and how it's not 'right' may be true for whatever your unique situation is, but from what I've seen and heard from many people, it's just not true for them.

My friend John wanted to buy bitcoin and ended up with bitcoin cash.  He had to sell it so he could buy bitcoin.  He lost money on the BCH, then had less money to buy BTC with, so he lost money by losing on BCH, and had unrealized gains on the BTC.
Now, since someone's named an actually person who lost money on it, move on to the next asinine angle.

You are not wrong.
If you move $10K USD onto coinbase, and something happens, it's insured (according to Coinbase, anyway) by the FDIC and you will somehow someday be compensated 100% of that loss.  
If you move $10K USD onto coinbase, and buy $6K of bitcoin, and both your coin and USD are stolen, you're only covered for the $4K USD.

I'm not suggesting this *will* happen, but be prepared for the possibility.  Sure, a nano or Trezor is a fair amount of $, but if you ever have to look - in hindsight, at the $100 you saved to not buy your own wallet, at the cost of a few grand, will you kick yourself, or pat yourself on the back and say to yourself 'it's ok, self, shit happens, and we'd do it the same way again if given a redo.'  If the answer is no, then I'd say no, your coins don't belong on coinbase.
