Seems like a lot of work for very little money.

Aw man, they don't ship to my country :/

Someone probably removed it and that is good :)

You can try and then just remove the parts that break their rules because if it's the advertising that is the problem I remember when OPSkins launched on of their employees posted there and told people about their service.

Looks great! Will it be on Android and iOS?

Just a tip be careful about this list because they list Bitin.co as a legit place to buy bitcoins and it is not. I tried to buy bitcoins for 550 dollars from them and never got my btc.

I do my banking online but the bank transfers only go through on weekdays.

I feel you, always so hard to try and get the bottom of the dip when the transfers takes so long.
@_date: 2017-09-25 15:29:56
Ah okay, thanks for the input! Having trouble to decide which one to buy. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 15:15:23


Why is that?
@_date: 2017-09-13 22:44:19
Took like 12 hours for me on 0.14.2.

And wears the freshest clothes.

It's a coin toss for me, some days it's slow as hell and the next it runs smoothly. But I haven't had any other problem than the website being slow. 
Have you had other problems with them?

Wondering the same, thought that guy was responsible. That guy must have felt really bad this whole time if he was innocent.

Can you do the [bitcoin guy]( riding the roller coaster in black and white with hodl over it?

I was planning on keeping them in my own private wallet as I have done since I bought bitcoin, but I was thinking that it's very convenient to keep them on Kraken considering they are going to support Bitcoin Cash. 
I would like to do this because I will probably sell them and I don't want to accidently screw something up and maybe lose my bitcoin when I setup the Bitcoin Cash wallet.
So is it worth the risk keeping my bitcoin on Kraken when the fork happens?

Sent a SEPA transfer to them like a week ago and in like 1 day I had the funds on the site.
