That's funny
@_date: 2018-01-17 07:05:18
Does it give me a blowjob?
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:43:49
Why doesn't SEC care?
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:02:26
It would've been better had Bitcoin didn't complete its 15 minutes of fame, it's really hard climb after that. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 07:19:22
With moon bases and nukes enough to end mankind
@_date: 2018-01-17 07:31:01
They don't see the potiental. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 07:36:56
Looks like we will make it to 8k yay!
@_date: 2018-01-25 08:23:55
And unless it's popular people will not appreciate that
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:48:18
The problem with idealism is its fickle as fuck. I rather put my money on the ever lasting flame of hate. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 07:38:30
They won't, once it drops below 10k it's a slide to the bottom with no anchor. This is it. This is the end. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 07:14:32
Unless it's where memes become reality
@_date: 2018-01-17 07:33:28
You would've been knee deep in pussy right now. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:11:06
"bitconnect is the best"
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:21:18
hmmm, you can care, but quietly
@_date: 2018-01-17 07:45:25
You are right, this is very important.  Bitcoin at it's most famous, didn't change anything, didn't take the opportunity to present a new vision for what's best. Didn't harness the popularity to give something benefitially new. It showed people that high or low Bitcoin doesn't actually become better or worse, it doesn't change anything, don't need it necessarily. I treat Bitcoin as a celebrity, who upon being famous makes the news and goes to the talk shows, enhances his brands, builds trust and shows what's in store. Bitcoin was the shy nerd who people already had suspicions about. I see it time and again, it's the end of careers, and end of Bitcoin bubble. Below 8k is my guess, possibly resting around 5k.

Grandma's are the worst with money. That's what a real estat guy told me, he preys on them.

Fake news is an American speciality.

japanese used to be very violent with samurais and kamakazi. now they dont know who they are anymore and its affecting their mating habits.  
@_date: 2018-01-17 07:07:44
This is barbaric ritual, Bitcoin is the S&amp;M of finance. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:49:41
Thanks man
@_date: 2018-01-17 07:10:43
I think it's going to go down more to very bottom levels. This is a restart. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:11:52
We can expect this to happen more and more. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:19:07


they were very collectivist no question asked? They lived many centuries with this honor, its all they know and now they live in a false reality.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:14:39
I want any car
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:45:16
Fuck that's stressful
@_date: 2018-01-25 08:22:16
The truth you speak it. Bitcoin was an experiment
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:02:36
Can't undo, that's why Bitcoin can't replace banks. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 07:13:05
But with Bitcoin it goes up fast again
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:47:26
Watch the big short. When strippers are buying you know something is up
@_date: 2018-01-17 07:37:29
Yeah it's very good but life can't be so predictable can it?
@_date: 2018-01-17 07:35:13
I just wish Bitcoin showed up later after I had income not when I was struggling  and wasting money for college. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:21:15
I think he's glad Bitcoin won't make him rich. You know how stressful it is to have all that money? What will you buy? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 07:06:29
What's cool about Monero?
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:12:22
you will reap the rewards in about 10 years
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:31:51
fuck this, dont deal with them people
@_date: 2018-01-17 07:31:45
Op sold to buy toy car, suck on that HODLers
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:25:14
That's what I want to know. I figure prices will adjust to make people with early Bitcoin less rich. Without bubble ever bursting. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:04:18
So altcoins are just for mining?
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:33:20
We winning too much, I'm tired of winning
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:18:25
Which wallet should one use?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:23:08
Will we all become rich or will things become expensive? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:04:52
What's hashing power? How do you sell power?
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:29:52
he bought
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:51:08
I wank like crazy everytime Bitcoin value gets higher. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:30:56
All or nothing,this is it, Bitcoin is the answer to all our financial problems. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:54:50
Who are these developers how are they elected? Where is this free money from? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:28:33
Riding straight into the future is definitely smart. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:48:27
What's better than Bitcoin? Nothing!
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:03:27
when is this fork?
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:50:17
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:45:33
Open source doesn't give me confidence. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:37:13
solve all your existential crisis needs by investing in Existencoin, a virtual currency that knows its virtual.
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:07:49
How another ETH?
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:46:18
I think people would want to match me.  This is very good time and in 5 years Bitcoin will be more valuable than gold or oil. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:26:19
what if its a bubble? why is it even splitting into two? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:26:24
I think not putting them in Bitcoin is a waste. I should take out loans for sole purpose of putting them in bitcoins. I'll be doing everyone a favor. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:06:39
are you telling me people now with millions because of this? why am i not seeing these people?
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:09:04
Dip into 5k?
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:56:06
the law was first applied to telephone companies and transitioned onto internet. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:22:24
i didnt and that could be the biggest mistake ever. i thought it was a scam. i dont even know who made it or what could happen to it. i didnt see govs letting it be unregulated.
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:17:16
Why buy now at all?
@_date: 2018-02-04 09:07:34
I wait for it to get to zero then I'm all in
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:16:28
I told everyone it would crash which is why I didn't buy the dip or hodl. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:33:37
What did the wallstreet fat cats do??
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:18:21
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:39:13
That's like college tuition money
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:15:12
When it drops it drops no coming back. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:32:33
And now it will end up at 2k and stay there for years. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 08:48:57
How about FNO? We didn't hear about GTZ and GTH either. I guess that means we are very OTE on this thing right haha
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:32:52
His 999 plan
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:29:22
Those that do not hodl will be punished by God
