To address your last question specifically, yes, that is what I have in mind. Some kind of key that grants you a one-time authority to create X bitcoins, as long as those bitcoins were destroyed first.

So was the idea of bitcoin before it was born.

It is my understanding zerocoin is an extension to the bitcoin protocol, which depends on miners, clients, etc adopting yet another layer to bitcoin. The idea here is to implement within the bitcoin protocol directly.
How would zerocoin work if person A uses it but not person B?

My thought process has been if you do modify the software or whatnot, you lose the cryptographic integrity that was associated with destroying those bitcoins.
And you would only gain this feature if you destroyed coins first. In other words, it should never be possible to create bitcoins out of thin air.
I don't know enough to know if this is cryptographically possible, provable, etc but I have read of other companies doing things off the record from the blockchain. So we are just to trust that, but not the idea of destroying bitcoins which provides an incentive to then recreate the same amount elsewhere?

Thanks for the thoughtful reply.
My thought process has been - yes, this would be an off-the-record transaction for exactly the reason of attempting to make bitcoin more like cash.
My reasoning is - if the system let someone destroy bitcoins (and that could be recorded in the blockchain...) then the person who destroyed the coins has an incentive to re-create them, and they could only re-create as many as they destroyed. If they attempted to modify the software or whatnot, then the coins would be lost forever. Is that possible as an OTR transaction?
Besides, it could also help "solve" or at least reduce another "problem" - the dependency of miners to secure the network. It would help spread out the risk a little more, perhaps?
