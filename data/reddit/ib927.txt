Given the alternatives available, wouldn't the rational choice be to move your business elsewhere?

Setting students up with wallets would be another way, given the current interest that companies are giving to students, I don't think it would be a stretch to parter up with someone such as Coinbase. We can provide a booth that helps you set up an account with a small balance, and you can then donate that amount if you want.

Money was already fast and cheap, bitcoin is what made money global.

I see great merit in doing that. But doesn't that require people to actually have Bitcoins in the first place?

First try doing some research on the colleges procedure to open a club. It should be available online or at the Deans office. I then talked to some friends that have previously opened other clubs. Also approach your professors to see if they are interested in helping you out. I got great advice and a lot of guidance doing that.

Lets distribute a stamp that has the bitcoin logo. And every time a bitcoiner uses paper currency, we can stamp it.

What makes your exchange proprietary to other global exchanges? 
Isint the whole concept based on breaking rather than building borders?
I dont understand what your trying to achieve by building an exchange for the middle east. What problem are you solving?
If your talking about creating an easy way for people in the region to buy bitcoin, then you need to approach this differently.
