So there are 2 systems
* Offline System - Creates PK's and then encrypts it, the etched key is already encrypted. The PK is discarded but the key to decrypt it is stored in the offline system. 
* An online system which is used to interact with the offline system via QR codes. 
* A whole gamut of checks and processes, before anything can be released etc. 
* The etching is done using laser , and can last quite long.

My bad , I am so used to coming here and r/ethereum , that I did not realize there are other places. Talk about living in a shell. Also, new to Reddit, let me know if I should remove this post and post it there or something.

Whitepaper is not behind data collection, the DApps model revolves around exchanges and not the user. As such we have no need for collecting data with the intend to use it. All data is encrypted both in flight and at rest. Privacy/ Anonymity is central to our system , if you just take a peek at our **timeline/roadmap** you will see thats the case.
Bitcoin is trustless you do need more middle men there. But that being said we still need to find a balance between the various parties involved because we still live in social systems. 
**No need to start hating, we need more love in this world and community.**
