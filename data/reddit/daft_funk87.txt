No, and there shouldn't be cause then the price wouldn't drop far enough for the patient ones. 
I have a hypothesis (or conspiracy theory) that large financial institutions are buying small amounts but amassing tons of them (Like Leo's Holes in Wolf of Wall Street). And then they'll put a run on Bitcoin, mass selling and then buying all the way down, taking the profits and tanking the price to scare people back to the 'safety' of Fiat.
And it'll kinda work, lots of people will lose money and savings and curse crypto.
And that's when the ~~Sharks~~*Hyena's* come in. And BTC will rally and buy back in for the real moon lambo HODL ride.
I hope for millions of BTC investors I'm wrong, but that's just what I see playing out.

The market cap grew by almost 100 Billion USD in 7 days.
Anyone who is not prepared for this either: is delusional, drank too much of the kool-aid or hasnt done their research.

Lol Depends when you bought and what you believe.
I believe has the potential to be NetScape or IE at this point.
But I also think this run is a false start. If what I believe will happens occurs, you'll see the price tank drastically, and people will compare it to the DotCom bubble. Every coin will take a hit. 
Thats when you buy and HODL until 100k.
But again, I could be and I hope I am wrong.
I'm not some sage investor, just...feeling it out.

I absolutely agree.
Anyone who has significant BTC holdings would be remiss NOT to buy a fuckload of Put options, then start their own fire sale, and ignite that panic.
This rise is not "THE" rise, but I have no problem betting that it will be within the next two that the price would stay above this point.
If the futures thing happened before Christmas, thats when I'd strike. In the wee hours of North America, Fire sale, crash the price, strike the fear into people to shy away form BTC.
And thats when I'll buy.

Well considering it pumped from 17K to 19.K on Gdax in under 2 minutes and GDAX just crashed...
