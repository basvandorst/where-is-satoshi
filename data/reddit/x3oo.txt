he is stupid. he's going for a big part of coins and this puts the whole network in danger and also all his investments. he should do it like butterflylabs. get rich by selling hardware and spreading mininghardware to get a healthy network from which he will benefit because he could get paid in btc. those butterflylabs guys are smart.

my bubble is a little bubble... just the topping of the cake.
i dont think bfl is going to sell their btc, because they've got big funders now. so no need for $.
beside that, theres always the euro crisis hanging like the sword of damocles over every $-pile. if you believe in bitcoin it would be stupid to sell your btc because of the euro...
@_date: 2012-07-17 17:57:16
@_date: 2012-07-16 18:58:09
pretty simple, because bitcoins don't inflate and the only reason they dont mine for themselves is because that would destroy bitcoin, since its only based on trust. if you spread the mining hardware you're going to achieve a better distribution so that you get a more stable network
@_date: 2012-07-16 21:13:16
it doesnt explain the main bubble but the smaller bubble. Everyone who still wants to order the new sc-chips has got to buy btc because transfer by wire wouldnt work until 23. i dont believe bit-pay is releasing them back in to the market instantly. so here's  my hypothesis: btc price on mt.gox is gonna slightly increase until next monday and then drop for 1-2 dollars... for example we hit 9 dollar on friday and got 7 dollar on thursday...
@_date: 2012-07-16 18:59:23
why would someone like bfl destroy their own jobs?
@_date: 2012-07-16 17:57:01
everyone is buying bfl chips and their deadline for orders ends in a week. so thats the reason for latest rise...
they only accept by wiretransfer or btc. wiretransfer needs to use emailcontact for instructions and so on, so that you risk missing the deadline, so everyone who wants bflchips is going to buy btc to pay bfl in btc...
--&gt; bubble is gonna burst on 22/23 july.
@_date: 2012-07-16 21:15:59
why are they inflating? do you have any facts? mt.gox is on my side...
@_date: 2012-09-18 02:03:16
bitcoin is based like any other currency on trust. if someone gets all the btc it would be stupid to buy btc because the one who already got a majority has ultimate power over your savings. if someone gets all the btc btc is going to lose trust --&gt; actually losing value... so that it's a pretty stupid idea to aim for a majority of bitcoins, instead try to support a good distribution of btc for a healthy ecosystem

Yes i know, but if you think of it as an guarantee, you didn't get that paygo can't work forever. It's a brainfart to think of it that way. 
It's like saying: It's a guarante and than proving that it's not a guarantee. You're disproving that it's a guarantee by supposing it's a guarantee. That's just a mindfuck. It's like going to a red car and supposing that it's blue and then disproving that it's blue. It's just totally wrong to think about it that way.
With PAYGO you are not investing in your own SS, you are litterally paying old people based on how much they payed other old people before. nothing else.

In a 2009 interview by the magazine Computerworld, Assange claimed to be in possession of "5GB from Bank of America". In 2010, he told Forbes magazine that WikiLeaks was planning another "megaleak" early in 2011, from the private sector, involving "a big U.S. bank" and revealing an "ecosystem of corruption". Bank of America's stock price decreased by 3%, apparently as a result of this announcement.[172][173] Assange commented on the possible effect of the release that "it could take down a bank or two."[174][175] In August 2011, Reuters announced that Daniel Domscheit-Berg had destroyed approximately 5GB of data cache from Bank of America, that Assange had under his control.[176]
edit: Assange was probably bullshitting about the reason they weren't releasing the information.

I think you're totally right. From my point of view:
1. BTC has a lot of financial benefits (useful)
2. BTC has proven to work over longer timescales (tested)
3. BTC is used already (If you buy bitcoin your not in some kind of lock-in technology like proprietary technologies use to do)
There is no way that rise is a bubble in overestimation but it's a bubble according market entry gate.

4. people arent paranoid enough to use btc perfectly anonymously, somewhere somehow they are going to find your adresses, at least for a majority of people. just think about how much google knows about your bitcoin adresses or skype etc etc...
