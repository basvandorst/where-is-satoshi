youtipit founder again: we adjust the rates manually, so our rates are sometimes a bit higher (or lower) than the mtgox rate.. 
We might be automating or binding the rate directly to mtgox (or somebody else)  in the futue..

I wouldn't mind that at all. On the other hand I'd like youtipit it grow slowly and let it stabilize properly. There are still so many seemingly small ,but necessary things we need to do. 
On the topic "reddit with money", we already have a simple prototype of an api working, with which you can create junkets for webpages, and have them "automaticaly" appear on, that page after you have created them. It just requires the addition of some javascript to the page..

paypal prohibits the sale of bitcoin (or any form of currency exchange) in their policy. So if you find somebody who does it, it will only be on a personal level. 
Their purchase protection is a nightmare for merchants, as you as a buyer can always claim that the bitcoins, were not delivered in the ordered color and ask for your money back...

Youtpit founder here: The cow is the youtipit mascot and we don't like plain stock fotos.. 
The cow stems from the fact that if you google youtipit, you will find many questions regarding "Does a cow fall over it you tip it?"
This is a question which has mankind still needs to  find an answer for..
