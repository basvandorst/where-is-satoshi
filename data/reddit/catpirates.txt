lol I really don't care I was just saying that using the fact that you took a photo doesn't prove anything. I don't even know what the game is. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 03:19:29
what's stopping you from putting a screenshot on your phone and then taking a photo in that case?
@_date: 2015-09-08 11:14:03
the word you are looking for is worst.

so your example is a flaw of the software used and not the Bitcoin protocol itself?
tell me more about "using Bitcoin wrong". 
@_date: 2015-03-05 11:12:10
man, these threads always turn so hostile. 
just fucking relax guys.

"Are you aware you are using Bitcoin wrong?"
wow, someone show me the Official Bitcoin Rules list please. Are you aware that they can use Bitcoin however they want? There's no right or wrong.

why does it indicate that PYC has a compromised wallet? you don't need to accept a transaction.

it definitely sold weapons.

Sorry! I should have included those details. If you wouldn't mind, I just posted some details here:

Hey dillpicklechips,
I'm sure you weren't losing any sleep over it but I wanted to let you know I got it sorted. I had 60c in my other wallet and transferred it across into the wallet I was having trouble with. It then said I only had 60c available to me!
So I reset the blockchain and transactions and now it's working.
Thank you again for your help! I really appreciate it.
Hope you had a good weekend :)

That wallet is the one highlighted in MultiBit -- are you familiar with MultiBit? What I mean to say is, do you know if I delete/uninstall MultiBit, that it is easy for me to gain access to my wallet again? Sorry for bugging you for tech support for the program, I'm just really unfamiliar with troubleshooting something like this! If it was a game or not related to real money, I would just uninstall without thinking twice.

That's okay, thank you for your help so far anyway -- it's greatly appreciated. :)
@_date: 2013-12-29 10:10:23
So I decided to look around on there, I'm not too familiar with blockchain.info -- does this mean anything to you?
Sorry for not including my Bitcoin address details earlier.
Thanks for your quick reply and help :)
Edit: I just realised, that doesn't show anything really -- but it links to my bitcoin address. I thought it was related to my problem, but it's actually from the 18th of December -- damn it!

you're not a moron for thinking that. :)
