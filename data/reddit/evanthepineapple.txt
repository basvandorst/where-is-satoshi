You are going to hear this a lot, but unless if you have full control over your bitcoins then you have no control over your bitcoins.
The whole point of bitcoin is that you get to be your own bank. So it really defeats the purpose to let some one else control your money. More over it is a major security risk. With sites such as coinbase it really is only a matter of when, not if, they get hacked. 
The great thing about phone wallets is that with the SEED you are able to replicate your wallet if your phone ever gets lost or stolen, same thing with a hardware wallet. It really is the safest and most convenient way to bitcoin.

If I wanted devaluing inflation then I would just stick with Fiat, plenty of inflation there. 
Bitcoin is perfect with its current rate of inflation, in fact money for most of its history never even had inflation, which is why currencies such as the Spanish dollar was an internationally accepted for over 200 years without a decrease in value. A Spanish Dollar made in the 1400's had the same value in the 1800's!
Inflation is fine for national currency but for a supranational currency, no inflation!

This is really only a decision you can make, if you believe that the fundamentals are there, that it does serve a purpose or at least will serve a purpose, and you are willing to hold on until you are redeemed in that belief then bitcoin may be a good investment for you. Personally I believe any price under $1000 is a good buy price for bitcoin in the long term and that the current price range is quite logical so bar any major unforeseen catastrophes and fuck ups now is a good time to buy.
@_date: 2016-08-06 09:02:12
That's good though, as really bitcoin was never designed for banks.
 Bitcoins path of success revolves around people cutting banks out of the loop. That way, once the banks realize they are on the outside, banks will invest in the infrastructure to make bitcoin widely usable, as an attempt to get back on the inside. 
It is probably the only way bitcoin will ever reach its full potential.

All fine and good but considering all the other basic income schemes I have seen it is essentially a ponzi scheme. What is basic income payment algorithym and how does it work. My guess is it is dependent on new people paying in an extra fee when they join that they can then make up by bringing in more people.

If Segwit does deploy there will most likely never be any blocksize increase in the future,rather scaling will go off chain (lightning network, etc).Hence the divide is between on-chain scailing and off-chain scailing.
Obviously it is against miners interests to have Segwit despite the potential upside of a full blown LN system in 20 years from now which they could profit from. As for the users it depends on wether or not you want to go to the world (off-chain) or let the world come to us (on-chain).
I think the best way to think about this is to go back to 1994 and ask your dial up internet service provider to invest 100% of their profits into highspeed fiberoptic network that wont be operational for 10 years while acknolwedging they may not even still exist in order to profit from its completion.

Roger introduced me to bitcoin and there is no one that I am aware of that is perhaps more passionate about bitcoin then Roger.
 If you look at the big picture Rogers work has only strengthened the community and even in regards to the scaling debate proposing another way of doing things and bringing awareness to the fact that a privately held company, with many different investors, has some influence over the main bitcoin development team.
I think in the long run this just makes bitcoin and the community stronger. 
We need to argue, to fight out ways of doing things and to learn and evolve. There is no perfect strait clean drama free path to success, success comes from turbulance and difficulty and obstacles and arguments.
Long live bitcoin!

I think the opposite, a UBI would need an non finite currency. With a constant rate of inflation consistant with the desimination of money among the population. Eventually a sandwhich would be worth $10,000 but it wouldnt matter because you would be receiving $1million a month. Next year the cost would be $12000 for a sandwich and you would recieve $1.2million a month. Bitcoin would be very sought after as it wouldnt be subject to the inflation of the UBI.

Okay but it seems there will be a week or two off posts saying something like "why doesnt BU just fork off already" and things of that nature, then in the last two days I see more and more posts saying this like BU better not fork or if BU forks its going to be a shitcoin which may or may not be the case but the way it seems as if people feel like a BU fork is a threat.
I Think the majority of pro segwit bitcoiners want a BU fork so that they can get rid of BU and have segwit.
@_date: 2017-03-10 08:55:07
Yeah I mean it honestly looks like at this point a hard fork is the only thing that will allow for innovation and for bitcoin to realize a path forward. I think those not in favour of a BU fork (wether pro BU or pro Segwit) dont really understand that as we are now in terms of the status qou is only going to hurt bitcoin in the long run.
A hard fork is necessary to clean this up and determine once and for all the next step for bitcoin.

The value wont change, and you will have double coins for the most part split between the two chains.
One chain will lose value though and as more people sell off it could go down to zero. The good news is of you pick the right chain to sell you can essential almost double your holdings on the chain you do want. Potentially.
@_date: 2017-03-13 21:57:02
Yeah honestly I thought this was going to be one of those stupid deversified posts but actually this is a great example of why you should ever consider selling some of your bitcoins.

Well to be honest if bitcoin is fragile that It cannot handle the reality of human society then so be it. I honestly think bitcoin will do just fine with such hostile and violent changes. And if it weathers them well, more people will have faith, and if it doesnt. Back to the drawing board.
@_date: 2017-03-27 01:13:15
Well the idea with a floating blocksize limit is that the fees wouldnt fluctuate based on network traffic.
The idea of fixed blocksize + 2nd level payment solutions is that the fees change based on increase in tx but as the fees rise more tx would flow to payment channels so it is theorized this would then help to regulate the fees from getting too high.
@_date: 2017-03-08 01:01:37
That is ussually never the case when it comes to technological innovations. Besides bitcoin will never truly take off without a massive failure of the current financial system. Segwit was never going to be the final piece of the puzzle in what will be a long road to a bitcoin future.
Arguably softforks and hardforks are currently off of the table. We need to look at creating a more cohesive and educated community with a firm understanding of the technical and economic aspects of bitcoin so that we eventually can work together and move together.
In fact arguably this moment now, the idea of a UASF, contentious and rebelous factions, is far more dangerous to bitcoin then taking a breath and trying to figure something else out.

This is non sequiter. Many people are on this sub that dont neccesarily believe in Segwit as a blocksize increase. Remeber this is r/bitcoin not r/segwit. Although it can be hard to tell sometimes with all of the "you are either with us or with them" devisiveness.
Funnily enough it is that kind of herd mentality and self assured smuggness that turns me off from the Segwit as a blocksize increase argument in the first place.

The "State" is not the "Public" although it likes to pretend it is. Your parents are not you and just like your parents the State can be very helpful and useful and have good ideas for your life, but they can also be horribly and utterly incorrect or malicious. 
People who argue against the free market or for a regulated market dont realize that just because you engage in regulated markets doesnt make reality go away. If anything it can only delay reality.
Free market is reality and as much as you think that you can create  and live inside your perfect artificial world with no danger of scams or blah blah blah the fact is sooner rather then later reality is going to poke its ugly head into your unicorns and rainbow world and hurt you.
The free market existed before governments, it has existed longer than any government, and it will exist as long as there are people to engage in trade.

If you have free electricity and if you think that the halvening is going to reduce the amount of miners and drop the difficulty level then buying mining equipment makes sense. If you believe the opposite of that then mining equipment is just a waste of your money.
To be honest it is all up in the air at this point but I personally believe that the gold rush is over, and mining has entered the large scale industrial phase. That means that perhaps you will get something out of mining but after electrical costs and equipment costs and the fact that your equipment may become outdated faster then it can produce. It is the equivalent of swimming upstream.

When people first started to trade food or other items.
It wasnt called the free market back then, it was just the market. Not much meat available, then you needed to trade more arrowheads etc etc, werent any meat subsidies or regulations on berry trading. 
That market still exists outside of the regulated market, just it is now where illicit substances and things of that nature that are traded.
So the free market is still alive, even thriving in a way, just right now it is called the black market, but it wasnt always that way and it wont always be that way.
Look how well the regulated market in venezuela has worked out. Suffice to say if it wasnt for the free market that has naturally sprung up in its place then the suffering would be considerably worse.

More like a temper tantrum then a summary.
The fanboyism surrounding blockstream is disconcerting. 
Specially considering that blockstream appears to consider corporate onramping as the primary growth opportunity for bitcoin and is looking to lock that sector down.
As a business person I can see where they are coming from. The logic is that corporate on-ramping will drive consumer usage.
Unfortunately blockstream will control this sector of bitcoin. It will be a monopoly.
and we all know how bad monopolies are.
This is going to be such a headache to route around ten years from now when we will all be forced to essentially use monopolized payment method to interact with corporations.

We should all be now working to better obscure transactions and figure more ways to bring anonymity to bitcoin. I think in the long run this will be a good thing. I also believe that this will be the begining of the end for centralized exchanges and hence a price rise due to the premium that decentralized buying options put on fiat to bitcoin transactions.

Why is locking in SegWit crucial?
Why is SegWit even important?
Your saying it is not the best solution and doesn't even solve any of the major issues bitcoin is facing.
It feels very top down and "take it, it is good for you, just trust us."
And yet I cannot see any real benefit for the average user of bitcoin user beyond perhaps it helps stop double spending. Although I imagine we could do that without SegWit.
@_date: 2016-12-05 03:53:11
You make it seem like excessive spending is a good thing. deflation allows for less spending and more investing, You will only invest in worthwhile business and infrastructure ventures because only those will satisfy consumer demand. Your purchases will focus more on necessities and quality. 
The economy is smaller, but stronger and more progressive.
Deflation is ultimately a good thing. It is like switching from cheap whisky to a nice expensive vintage Scotch. You drink less but you savor every drop.
Ultimately it means an end to manufactured obsolescence, cheap garbage that pollutes our planet, and real technological break through to justify consumer purchasing.

really the complete opposite would be true. 
Right now fiat to bitcoin makes up the largest portion of bitcoin transactions hence the increase in value comparative to fiat (bitcoin to fiat would make for a general decrease in value)
 A denial of such a transaction would ultimately be good for bitcoin as people would need to offer real goods and services in exchange for bitcoin instead of fiat. That means a real bitcoin economy would emerge as opposed to the fiat economy that we are piggy backing off of.
Ultimately this would be most likely to occur during a massive economic downturn.

I think your belief is shaped by your enviorment. I can easily see how such a concept would be logical to someone who has grown up in a centralized system. 
I think though that you are missing out on a coming paradigm shift resulting in a decentralized power grid and distributed computing that could easily make bitcoin highly decentralized.
Both are likely outcomes. I think though that centralization is going to meet the maturation of the information age and while centralization may not be completely defeated it will be the begining of a new world order, one that resembles a world we thought only existed in the history books

I would move 50% into bitcoin and keep the rest liquid. It sounds risky, but I am 95% into bitcoin right now and just about to pull out of the stock market with record gains thanks to this current bull run. 
The reason I would keep the rest liquid is because you are in no rush and should wait out a cheaper time to buy into the stock market, or god forbid the bitcoin market. 
 The 50% into bitcoin because if you believe in bitcoin enough to put 7% in then you misewell go 50% in.

Bitcoin was designed to be money, it is most valauble as money, and we must seek to use it as money. Not convert it to fiat but actually buy and sell for bitcoin.
What people dont seem to understand about what you are saying to them that the best store of value is something that is actually usable. 
So all you down voters of u/BTC_Forever, tell us one thing that you can buy with digital gold ownership as it currently stands on the commodities market?

Anything below $800 is cheap right now. Anything under $1000 is a good buy. Higher then that and I would be sceptical with out seeing some correction prior to the price slowly moving up

If you are going to invest long term buy a hardware wallet such as a trezor or a ledger nano. Then purchase coins with cash through local bitcoins. The price will be a little bit higher but it will save you a lot of trouble later on.
Next how do maintain access to your coins 10-15 years into the future? You are going to need to take good care of your seed. Making multiple copies and storing them in secure locations will help to maintain security. Perhaps even disguise the seed to make them more difficult to steal

It is a great idea seeing how you are a tech company. If they dont know about bitcoin now is the time for them to learn, if they cant figure it out well they probably shouldnt be in a tech company, but I am sure if it is a smaller company those that can figure it out can help teach others. It is a great way to build cohesion and introduce the money of the information age.
@_date: 2016-11-21 10:41:46
Precisely. The CP doesnt see bitcoin as a threat to China, rather to western banking cartels. The Chinese are premier  experts in economic warfare they realize that bitcoin is highly favourable to them long term. It is not favourable to western nations though do to our reliance on the financial sector. I highly reccomend the book, Currency War.
@_date: 2016-11-25 09:59:21
This is where people are confused. Selling bitcoin for fiat brings the price down, but if people are using bitcoin to purchase items directly and bitcoin is not converted to fiat then the price does not fall!!!!!!!
That means if bitcoin is used as money it is very stable!
but if it bitcoin is used as a store of value then people will only be converting to fiat and that is what creates price volatility.
@_date: 2016-12-18 20:02:08
It depends on the type of trading. But reading your post about tax issues I would avoid trading and just purchase with cash. 
A good way you might consider to gather money due to only about $24,000 in income would to sell of anything and everything you can get your hands on. With millions in income there must be a lot of shit your family have accumulated using your name.
Convert that into bitcoin. Get as much bitcoin as possible and then design your escape plan.

Okay all great advice thank you. I would be in Bitcoin not for trading but as a long term investment so I think I will wait until after it is decided. hopefully the price won't have gone up to dramatically. I suppose that it may even go down because people like myself that are just getting interested in Bitcoin may be scared off by this development due to their lack of understanding on exactly what is happening.
@_date: 2017-04-10 08:00:00
Okay but then wouldnt you end up with the same problem then as the nodes only accepting the segwit blocks would fork the miners off from the nodes that accept say BU or Classic blocks right?
@_date: 2017-04-10 09:34:54
Of course it would, the whole point of UASF is to force miners to accept segwit by orphaning their blocks if they dont. But essentially a BU UASF could also be implemented that would allow non  segwit miners to continue to mine and then we would have two chains.
So it appears no matter what we may end up with two chains.

This isnt an experiment anymore. What you have stumbled on is most likely the future. Gold backed currencies dominated the agricultural age, the petrol dollar came along with the maturation of the industrial age, and most likely a digital currency will be the currency of the information age replacing the petro-dollar once the information age matures and surpases the industrial age.

Yes it would, but you may possibly lose money if the price of bitcoin goes down during the period of time between when you buy and when you sell. Likewise you may gain money if the price increases after buying.
I think a transaction like this on an exchange would take multiple days to accumulate bitcoins and that would prolong the risk. the good thing is that it is essentially 50/50 if the price increases or decreases.

When I use circle my denomination is in bitcoin so when I buy bitcoin I just enter the amount of bitcoin I want to buy and as soon as I press execute it puts in an order at that price point and deposits the bitcoin in my account. Showing up as say 1.5 btc.
Since your account is in dollars I am not sure how that works, did you actually purchase bitcoin or did you only deposit money into the account? I know that circle can be used for USD transactions as well.

If you have a debit card or bank acount either head over to coinbase.com or download the circle app. Register your account and buy away. In the future Coinbase may allow purchases from paypal.
