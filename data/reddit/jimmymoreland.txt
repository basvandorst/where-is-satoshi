This is quite possibly the worst possible advice one can give.  Absolutely do not listen to this FUDster. He’s either investor illiterate or attempting to scare you. Again - don’t listen to jackasses like this. 
My advice is to dollar cost average this dip. If you plan on putting another $1,000 in - maybe do it in 3 or 4 separate purchases. That being said, conventional wisdom is ‘time in the market beats timing the market,’ so there’s no shame in putting in the full $1K and continuing on with life outside of crypto. 
Edit - I am an experienced holder 
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:57:38
What was the price of Bitcoin in 2010? What is the price now? How much would you have gained by holding that entire time (hint - it's a wee bit more than 60%)
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:46:55
Lol at your ‘friend’ on LinkedIn who wrote an article on only his good trades. Carry on pal - this conversation has gotten too dumb for me to handle.
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:12:34
Bitcoin still has yet to even dip 50% from it's ATH. Until that happens, this is just a correction in crypto world 
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:00:37
Well what’s gold backed by? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:33:05
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:52:59
What do you have against monero? 
@_date: 2018-01-24 22:27:09
While I don't disagree completely, why not? Back up your statements 
@_date: 2018-01-24 22:18:40
Care to elaborate on this claim? Breaking up centralized mining power and reducing carbon footprint seems like a pretty good system to me. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:44:09
Of course it could be. There have been major events before. This could even be the start of a major bear market but to say this is the beginning of the end is ABSURD and shows your lack of knowledge on markets and bubbles in particular.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:42:32
You’ve got to me kidding me. Coppers conductivity is greater period. Copper is cheaper. Period.
Does gold last longer? Sure - but for most electronics the longevity of gold doesn’t even come into play. 
Are your really arguing that gold is used more than copper? Are you really making this argument? 
Edit - as for my finances. Well it would probably make you sick knowing when I got into bitcoin. On top of bitcoin I max out my 401k and Roth IRA and put 70% of the rest into traditional investments. The other 30% oooo weeee has that exploded from buying and holding. Don’t worry about me pal. I’m doing just fine :) 
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:38:31
This is called a market correction and it happens quite frequently. This is completely normal 
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:50:31
And yet the network congestion at cryprokitty mania peak was still far less than bitcoin... 
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:45:31
Point to where I said bubbles don’t happen? Of course they do but pointing to one to predict another just doesn’t work. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:36:33
Who said it wasn’t a bubble? Of course it is. That said - it’s crashed before and it will crash again. I’m very invested in this space and this crash hasn’t phased me in the least because 1.) I’m still 300% up and 2.) I did not invest more than I’m afraid to lose. Amazing what responsible investing can do for ones psyche ;) 
@_date: 2018-01-24 22:28:13
What are you talking about dude? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:06:19
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:04:30
You do know this isn’t even the biggest correction of the last 12 months right? Every single time we’ve had one, this chart has been shown and shown to be Incorrect. Point is there is no textbook definition of a bubble... never has been. Could this be it? Sure - but not because of that dumb graph. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:32:00
Not material enough for you? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:08:38
And Satoshi made Bitcoin. What's your point? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:41:19
Sure does and it took 5 years and a $5T marketcap to occur! 
Before the crash took place, you will find many, many similar shapes over those years.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:30:35
Thank you for your sacrifice 
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:21:40
You realize I'm on your side right? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:39:23
He's talking about you...
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:42:58
Stop making so much sense Jesus. Sheesh...
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:25:31
He bought in for the first time at $14K (or so he claims) 
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:34:34
Because how was I supposed to know 20K was the top of the run? Almost everyone thought $10k was the top and then it just kept going and going and going. I’m an investor not a trader. Have I taken some profit along the way? Sure - but I’ve been in this game way too long to think I have the ability to time the market. No one can so it’s easier to just hold. 
The better question is whether or not I think bitcoin will be worth more than $20k someday. I do so I continue holding. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:27:10
Lol I’m still up many times over. My investment technique has proven super fruitful. How bout you? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:29:45
Who is? The gentlemen directly above you is 100% correct 
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:10:15
Please do not listen to this advice 
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:36:27
Lol at 20-30% being 'carnage' 
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:21:37
Yes of course noone is buying coffee with Bitcoin now. We aren't even close to mass adoption and thus stabelization. My argument is under the assumption of mass adoption taking place.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:27:23
Maybe it’s the masochist in me but I kinda love days like today the most. Makes me feel aliiiiiiive 
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:29:26
Apparently you weren’t aware copper beats gold in pretty much all categories of conduction. You kinda sorta sounded smart in your response though! 
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:04:28
The same day a NYT article basically goes all in on Ethereum? Color me confused
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:07:43
Bitcoin will always have a place in my heart and I think it’s future is still bright. That being said Ethereum will truly change the world. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:26:18
I was being sarcastic. Of course I was. I’m on your side man :) 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:16:17
And what happens when you zoom out? How about in? Does the graph change? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:34:36
After a quick Google search
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:03:44
What’s wrong with small fees if they ensure decentralization and are way lower than inflation? You REALLY don’t understand this whole crypto thing 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:58:02
I love bitcoin but why on earth would you sell your ether... right now? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:55:39
Lol if you've been in this game long enough you'd know holding has been much more lucrative than trading....
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:10:56
Not even going to try with this one. Good grief ��‍♂️
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:58:28
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:29:04
Instead of squinting your eyes to see if the bitcoin graph matches some made up diagram, the more accurate indicator would be total market cap. The .com crash happened at $5T. Bitcoin is currently just above $.5T. 
Could it come tumbling down? Sure - but it’s not because you made yourself believe bitcoin is perfectly following your bubble graph. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:39:03
That’s the entire crypto market cap pal, and absolutely the best indicator we have. You do know publicly traded .com companies  were brand new at one point too right? You do know websites are a relatively new thing in the grand scheme of things... right? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:28:31
This is why you don’t sell (as long as you arent overextended) 
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:51:18
Because Bitcoin has never done a rollback?
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:16:18
I’ve lost half my crypto worth many times before and every time it’s bounced back stronger than before. I did not invest more than I’m willing to lose, maxed out my 401k, maxed out my Roth IRA, and put 65% of the rest in index funds. After doing all that the other 35% over the years has been guilt free and made me a lot of money. On top of all of this, because I hold, ill never having to pay a dime of short term cap gains tax. 
But hey keep spreading fud. I’ll just sit here cool as a cucumber still up many times my DCA even after this ‘crash’
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:54:36
Almost definitely huh?? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:36:18
It is very easy to find charts that match our bias. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:31:34
The entire crypto market cap is just over half a trillion dollars. It’s going to take much more than that for these swings to become less violent. It is still VERY early. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:35:46
Lol at stockbrokers. If there’s one thing that was proven to us by warren buffets bet it’s that trying to time the market almost always loses to just being in the market. Your customers most likely would have been better off reading personal finance blogs and long term investing on their own. There’s a reason your profession will soon be gone.  
If only you knew what holding bitcoin has made me and million of others who decide to stick it out for the long term... Find me one trader who has seen the same returns over a multi-year time frame and we can chat. Until then...lol
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:47:17
This is absolutely incredible. Bravo, sir, Bravo!
Nothing like Reddit liars whose past post history comes back to bite them in the ass ��
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:13:31
If inflation costs me more than the transaction fee (probably does) than I'd be happy to pay said fee on my cup of joe
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:19:25
The irony...
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:39:25
Ladies and gentlemen - THIS is the dude who started this thread. He is a complete and utter fraud. Happy holding! 
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:25:16
Never said it wasn't a bubble. Bubbles usually form around world changing ideas (railroads, automobiles, .com, etc). But i believe it'll bounce back no matter what happens and that has proven incredibly lucrative for me (and many others) over the years. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:26:00
Well in the last month ETH is up 48% and BTC is down 42%. There’s one recent example for ya. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:08:38
I completely understand the situation at hand. Tech has always threatened China’s sovereignly. This is nothing new. In the past they have been able to ban centralized websites (Facebook, Amazon, etc). In the case of bitcoin it is not so easy and will become next to impossible as soon as decentralized exchanges become the norm. 
As for mining - those farms will just move to other cheap regions. Expect Central American mining farms to grow. 
Again - this is just a blip on the radar and crypto will live on just as it did after the last 10 China FUD stories. If you don’t think so then you don’t understand the space. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:20:59
It actually already did briefly. Bounced right back though 
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:15:50
You have literally 0 clue what you are talking about. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:32:58
Good read on the possibilities and also why I’m most bullish on Ethereum. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:24:17
Lol yup. THIS time it’s REALLY crashing! 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:23:39
God damn do I love this shit.

Traders only tell you about their good trades
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:46:29
Stop using the word trader. There's a difference between trading and investing. Not everyone trades.
As for the tulip comparison, just stop. A one time freak bubble that occured for about a year is quite a bit different than a technologcal breakthrough which created a brand new asset class that has been going strong (with many little blips along the way) for almost a decade 
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:45:02
People like to say Ethereum is less decentralized because it has a figurehead. In reality - as this article states - its much more decentralized at the moment.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:23:14
I’ve more than quadrupled. It would take a drop much further than this for me to only double it. This is child’s play (so far) compared to past dips.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:17:56
Lol do you remember what email was like as late as the year 2000? World changing tech takes time man.  The automobile did not go from Model T to Lambo in just 9 years...
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:44:38
Rarity is its value huh? The irony of this comment...
lol at thinking a rock has any value outside of what the market says it’s worth 
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:04:57
What in the actual hell are you talking about? Do you know anything about Ethereum? I love bitcoin but Ethereum arguably has the most valuable coin/token model in the entire space at the moment. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:13:01
Smart 
@_date: 2018-01-24 22:29:07
Bitcoin has been rolled back too. Make all the excuses you want to but the two events aren't very different.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:05:40
Lol a long time ago my friend. It would have to drop much much much much much further for me to only double my money. I’m chilling. Your lack of knowledge on how blockchain tech works is what’s concerning. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:10:46
You think this is bitcoins first big rise? This is actually bitcoins weakest bull run in terms of % gained. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:22:00
Ahhh so what your are saying is that outside of uses for electronics (there are much better and cheaper conductors by the way) it’s backed by many years of trust stemming from people thinking it’s pretty and/or a good store of value. Lol got it. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:43:27
You've got to be kidding me. China FUD has been going on since the very beginning of Bitcoin. There is NOTHING unique about this dump.
"The lesson from the Internet is, anything China bans, invest in it”- Fred Wilson (USQ) in 2014
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:59:19
And then it may get serious. Point is - many of us in here have held through MUCH WORSE than where we currently are. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:30:28
How long have you been in this space? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:57:39
Wut? There are many people - 2.2 billion in fact - that have a smart phone and no access to financial institutions. Seriously - what in the actually fuck are you talking about? 
Edit - Whether or not bitcoin solves this problem remains to be seen. OmiseGo (OMG) is specifically trying to solve this problem. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:42:39
Like all bubbles? Man I’m glad someone didn’t tell that to google, Amazon, and all real estate companies! 
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:31:11
Consolidating in the 10-13k range for awhile would be fantastic IMO 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:20:12
BTC will never only have 1-5% swings until it gains mass adoption. Less than 1% of the world owns bitcoin. It’s entirely reasonable for a new asset class or currency to experience volatility as this takes place. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies cannot be compared to traditional markets. 20-30% is normal in THIS market and happens with regularity. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:05:58
Wut? There’s a big difference between investing and trading. Truly wise investors aren’t concerned with short term price swings and honestly probably don’t even look at price all too often. 
As for your friend - that is very very sad and I hope he’s okay. If he is, if nothing else, this will be a lesson in not overextending himself in the future. 
If you don’t invest more than your comfortable losing these dips are pretty easy to handle. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:39:25
Depends on the project. I could easily see the entire marketcap doing another 5x though. Hodling always wins. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:22:50
So I should cash out my index fund and 401k during the first sign of trouble? Lol got it. The people who lost in the Great Recession were those who cashed out before the second greatest bull run in history started. 
Remind me never to ask you for investment advice. Not that I’d need it...I’ll just sit here laughing at you atop my huge piles of digital coins that I’ve slowly accumulated through long term investing.  By all means though - continue trying to time the market. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:06:07
How about across borders? How about when adjusted for inflation? Come on man you know it's not that simple...
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:33:08
Pretty epic 50 year return...
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:45:16
Again those bubbles all popped after many years and a huge market cap. The crypto market cap is TINY in comparison 
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:03:19
And by your logic Myspace or friendster would be one the most valuable companies in the world today.
Ethereum has the most and arguably best developers in the space and is ahead of most at the moment. Could that change? Sure - but as it stands now it's absolutely absurd to declare Bitcoin as the only game in town. It's this kind of hubris that has taken down huge companies and even entire industries 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:24:50
He blocked off January 2017 until now. What in God’s name are you talking about? You could zoom into many points in bitcoins decade long history and see something that looks just like this “textbook crash” 
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:59:34
Wow - you have no understanding of how this works. Decentralized architecture algorithm? WTF? You do know blockchain =/= decentralized right? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:37:57
And what makes you say that? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:38:26
This drop is far from over 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:56:01
Dude we are talking about a market cap bigger than coca-colas. If random fud on Reddit is damaging to bitcoin than bitcoin has bigger problems than we want to admit. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:10:18
Or noobs who got in on the 10k gold rush will say fuck this and bail with their minor profits. Could go either way 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:43:48
They are literally just exchanges. Every time someone sells BTC, someone else is buying it. This is how any and all exchanges work - just not crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:13:32
Yep this has a lot further to drop 
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:00:37
Catch ya later 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:11:14
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:31:40
Bitcoin could very much be the MySpace of cryptocurrencies. It has ton fuck ton of issues and if you don’t believe that you are being a bit naive. The fact of the matter is that there is much better tech out there now and if bitcoin doesn’t get its shit together it could lose out.
Also - centralized shitcoins? What kind of regurgitated BS is this? At this stage there are even more decentralized projects than bitcoin. Bitcoin has serious political issues that have led to consolidated power. Me thinks you haven’t don’t much research... 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:32:56
Yep no chance im buying for a bit 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:23:49
Not even sure bitcoin and ethereum can be compared. 
Ethereum = oil
Bitcoin = gold
For investment purposes both offer tremendous potential and aren’t going anywhere anytime soon. Gold is pretty and shiny and offers no utility, but it acts as a tremendous store of value. Oil is not pretty at all but powers the world. Take your choice. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:03:33
But it still functions better than bitcoin with twice the transaction volume...
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:24:55
Monero 
Ripple is on its way to being MUCH more decentralized.
Ethereum is already more decentralized IMO (although others will argue this). That being said, when it moves to Proof of Stake it won’t even be a question anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:30:32
The two aren’t related. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:16:15
You’d be able to write it off as a loss if you cashed it out or traded it for another crypto. The first taxable event stands based on the prices at the time of trade.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:25:19
What’s ethically wrong about it? Seriously - if someone you knew who worked at Apple told you they would soon be announcing a product more revolutionary than the iPhone would you really not act on it? How is this ethically wrong? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:18:55
Lol because he’s not wrong. Bitcoin is a fucking nightmare in many aspects right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:51:19
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:45:07
Lol okay man - everything is rainbows and butterflies and the bull run will never stop ever. Happy? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:59:34
Because going from $10K to $19,500 in a matter of days is not healthy or sustainable. People take profits and it sets off a chain reaction. Strap in cause this could get ugly 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:24:37
Hold on to your hats! 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:17:22
If you made hundreds of thousands (maybe millions) in a matter of days would you take profits? That was not healthy growth and support hasn’t been established since what $6K? This is gonna drop for awhile.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:39:35
Apart of it in what way? Like mining farms and exchanges? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:07:17
Redditor for 1 week. Relax young buck. This is how crypto works. Either buy all the way down or start drinking and don’t look again til after New Years. Either way - you’ll probably be fine 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:52:38
Yes more merchants take bitcoin right now but it’s also been around much longer. I see no reason for companies not to take follow overstock.com’s lead and also allow Ether as a form of payment. Plus who is actually spending their bitcoin right now anyway? 
The better store of value argument still doesn’t hold up though. While both are volatile, Ethereum currently has greater returns than Bitcoin and will also start rewarding holders once they move from PoW to PoS. Better returns (potentially) AND ‘dividends?’ To me it’s clear which blockchain acts as a better store of value. 
Much of this is speculation as Ethereum also has a very long way to go and has its own scaling issues to work out. That being said - Bitcoin being the  superior store of value and transaction platform just doesn’t make sense to me...
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:37:02
That’s fair! Currently people seem to be moving to BCH...

Welp this looks like the slow bleed period. Welcome to the bear market... 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:43:39
It’s going to be very interesting to see what Proof of Stake does for Ethereum. I personally think it’s going to be a game changer 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:21:47
1.) you are not buying bitcoin from Coinbase when you purchase. I can’t imagine you believe otherwise
2.) It’s a startup who had no idea the amount of volume that was about to hit them this year. Predicting growth and scaling is the hardest thing for a startup to do. I work for one and we go through similar issues. This is certainly not a cash issue - they’d love to take your fees if they could. 
Shitting on Coinbase has become incredibly fashionable here which confuses me because they are the sole reason bitcoin has broken into the main stream. You can literally thank them for your gains but instead you choose to bite the hand that feeds you. 
They are a young company in a space that is just starting out. It’s the Wild West and we are all figuring shit out as we go. Either understand the risks and buy or don’t.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:17:44
Care to back this statement up? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:17:43
It’s definitely got further to drop 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:01:06
Because you make it sound as though eth is some stable asset. This type of advice could really hurt someone. Eth is incredibly volatile and not any sort of safe haven from huge swings.

@_date: 2017-12-20 20:20:15
That’s literally what bitcoin cash is.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:12:36
Not buying it. This has further to go IMO 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:19:17
Nothing like an epic ether pump to start the morning

Calling sub $12k 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:19:48
Here we go again!! 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:47:50
Of course we are. At some point soon we’ll be at an all time high. Right now is not that time 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:41:16
I find it much easier to hold when it’s going down than up 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:37:49
This is the whole BTC vs BCH debate. In the short term fees are just going to keep going up (as long as the network keeps getting more and more congested) unless BTC raises the block size - which seems unlikely. Long term the problem should be solved with the lightening network but that’s a year or two away. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:44:30
The irony of people shitting on the company that brought crypto into the mainstream and is the entire reason for 2017s bull run....
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:19:07
Always HODL. That said, this could be the big one. Strap in and buy the fucking dip! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:05:44
That’s like - your opinion man. 
Is it the fast block times and low fees that make it a scam? I’m confused - please explain for me.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:48:28
Lol at definitively saying this is the bottom of the dip. Come on man, this is crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:03:53
You’ll have another chance 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:10:58
Why is it worthless? Faster transaction times and cheaper fees seems pretty valuable to me...
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:39:59
How do you explain ether then? It’s doing twice the amount of transactions bitcoin is and it’s speed and transaction costs blow bitcoin out of the water...
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:33:22
For sure but the capacity necessary is still being worked on and there is a clear roadmap laid out. In theory Casper and sharding should solve it. Time will tell. 
All that being said - even at the cryptokitty peek (close to 800,000 transactions) Bitcoin was still slower and more expensive. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:33:43
Whatever I can afford. I’d definitely get into ethereum as well. Incredibly undervalued at the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:33:10
Nah this isn’t close to being over 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:31:52
Historic? This is par for the course. Shit it hasn’t even corrected 50% yet
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:50:50
I actually find there’s something exhilarating about watching my net worth swing wildly. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:45:04
Lol please don’t take your buying advice from me. I know as much as you do. Of course it will come back down at some point, the question is when? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:33:25
His response is incorrect. Bitcoin network fees are absurd no matter which platform you are initiating the transfer from. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:11:43
Or maybe it’s more telling that the OG bitcoiners believe it Cash’s version more. Just because you don’t own it or think it’s the better coin does not make it a scam.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:40:22
This is hardly pain 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:59:20
Strap in! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:05:17
This is completely untrue 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:29:32
It will be if all goes according to plan and I don’t even like ripple or own any
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:19:23
Yep. This is very very healthy. You don’t just go on a 400% parabolic bull run without a major correction. No market works like that... ever 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:10:26
So how’s everyone doing this morning? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:36:25
Then you should know things don’t always just bounce right back 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:13:14
Problem is people are learning that bitcoin isn’t the only option for said liberty and that there are other cryptos out there with arguably better tech. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:19:43
For the love of god, theres no hidden premium fee on gdax. In fact there are barely any fees at all on gdax. Demand determines price. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:35:34
Considering it’s a true and free market with no regulations, theoretically TA should work for crypto even better.
Hodler and not trader 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:42:13
Because they think it will go much lower. I’d venture to guess they are right 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:55:54
In my opinion it’s got a lot further to drop, yes. I think we’ll see 4 digits. That being said, I could be very wrong. I am very often. The truth is no one knows and that is why I hodl. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:03:20
Bull trap 
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:55:44
I don’t - not at first at least. I think we are in for some pain in the short term. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:58:07
You’ll have another chance 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:52:33
Lol I don’t have a dog in this fight other than holding a smallish amount of BTC. I believe in ethereum more than anything. Just trying to understand why BTC maximalists reject BCH so strongly. Seems mostly emotional rather than rational to me...
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:18:04
Yep because god forbid people have choices
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:26:04
Here we go ladies and gents 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:38:52
Never once said fatal flaws. It can be fixed. That being said - 7 transactions per second, $15 fees, fork after fork after fork,  community infighting, and consolidation of power is a good place to start. At this point bitcoin is so far away from its original vision it’s scary. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:41:03
Was jus saying this to a friend of mine. It’s the masochistic side of us. For some reason I find it weirdly pleasurable watching my net worth plummet 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:24:08
His point was that it’s linear 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:29:18
Huh? It’s literally processing double the amount of transactions for faster and cheaper today with a clear non-contentious scaling roadmap ahead. If Bitcoin had to process as many transactions as eth is doing on a daily basis it would literally take twice as long as it does today and that’s saying something. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:44:53
10k IMO. That said - I don’t know shit 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:57:00
Fundamentals matter. They especially matter in a space still in its infancy and rapidly advancing. To assume Bitcoin will stay on top strictly due to first mover advantage is hubris at its finest and the exact reason it could fail. It’s a story as old as time and if you don’t think so you are being incredibly naive. 
EDIT: Also no one gives a shit about other cryptocurrencies? Is this a joke? There are more devs working on ethereum and ethereum based projects than all other blockchains combined. Ethereum has numerous large companies and governments in its alliance. Coinbase’s (the gateway of crypto) CEO is far more bullish on Ethereum and is building a dApp store. On top of all this Ethereum will soon be Proof of Stake which will pay out dividends just to hold. Investors love dividends.
I am not trying to shill ethereum over bitcoin. I am making a point that many many people care about it (and other blockchains) and if Bitcoin doesn’t get its shit together it can easily be taken over in size and scope. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:18:34
Like the for profit, centralized lightening network? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:31:56
Why is it unfair and how can it be used to manipulate a market? 
Edit - Bitcoin is supposed to be a libertarians wet dream; yet when competition comes around and markets swing, all of a sudden the community starts crying for regulations to protect it. Sounds to me like you want to have your cake and eat it too.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:28:57
Damn I have a pretty bearish short term outlook but yours is way worse than mine. Define shit hitting the fan.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:16:16
While I agree with this, this is very easy to say when your only 2 weeks are mostly good times and gains. Let’s see how you react when the market corrects 65% over multiple months. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:14:15
The cost basis is based on the USD value at the time of the trade
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:35:59
Am I missing something? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:34:14
Lol please don’t make any decisions based on what some random Internet stranger says. I think we are overdue for a major correction but that doesn’t mean I’m right. In fact I’m usually wrong and that’s why I HODL
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:00:45
I’d personally wait til after futures anyway 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:20:04
How long have you been in bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:36:04
Might as well sell if you can’t handle this small drop. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:53:18
It could easily dip that low. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:28:27
I wouldn’t be that shocked ��‍♂️
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:52:25
Well this isn’t true. Trying to trade the volatility is gambling but just being in the market definitely is not (as long as you know why you’re in) 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:22:00
Yes and those convenience fees are not hidden or baked into the price. They are sitting there in black and white for you to see. The price of the coin itself is based on the market value (from gdax) at the time of purchase.  
Do you think that every exchange in Korea just happens to charge and exorbitant fee? No - the demand is greater there. Econ101 shit.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:24:16
I think it will. That being said, I don’t know shit so you should prob buy now 
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:59:49
Google is your friend. Tons of news and announcements on this recently 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:34:42
My biggest fear with bitcoin. At some point fundamentals trump brand. It’s a story as old as time - especially in tech. While I have confidence in the team - the lack of innovation compared to other blockchains is a little concerning.  That being said - Bitcoin usually finds a way and I’m confident it will continue to do just that. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:29:50
4 figures here we come 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:16:21
Yeah accept youre wrong. Check your GDAX highs and lows. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:00:52
This makes no sense 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:05:08
Me too but I suspect not for the same reasons you do. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:56:44
Meh while I agree that this has further to drop, I disagree with your ATH assessment. No one can guess the top. This bull run has seen all time high after all time high. People who invested when it hit $7k for the first time are pretty happy right now 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:11:36
Lol I’m very aware of the differences. So raising the block size risks centralization because you can’t run a full node on your raspberry pi yet Blockstream and the lightening network do not? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:23:20
See my response to chocolate. You noobs have a lot to learn. Well soon find out who has weak hands.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:52:41
I don’t believe it’s monkey business.  It’s still a very new company and there’s no way they could predict the kind of volume they are getting this year. Scaling is the hardest thing for a startup ti figure out. I should know - I work for one. It’s actually gotten a lot better since the early days of summer 
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:37:23
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:24:18
Are you suggesting increase in price is Bitcoins value? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:35:44
This is not true. Ethereum is doing more than twice the transactions Bitcoin currently is and it’s fees are almost non-existent...
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:20:59
Yet bitcoin cash is the more centralized crypto? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:13:28
Please don’t listen to this guy. He literally has no idea what he’s talking about and probably has only been in this game the last few months if he’s making comments like this.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:55:03
I agree. It just feels like it’s been on the edge of a massive correction for 3 days now.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:54:20
Lol I’m still up hundred of percents. I’m doing just fine pal 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:24:47
No it’s not a gray area. Cryptocurrencies are treated as property and thus any sale or trade is a taxable event. Period. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:32:09
Lol we haven’t even fallen 50% yet 
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:20:17
Let’s play guess the bottom. I’m going with $11,750
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:36:15
Sure you can. Bitcoin has been an incredible investment and I believe it will continue. That being said - you can definitely lose. Speaking in definitives like this is dangerous.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:58:55
I’d say below 10 for sure. I’ll buy again once it goes below 11k though 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:02:14
My point is that my opinion has no real reasoning behind it. It’s just my personal opinion and I could be very wrong. I often am. Again no one fucking knows what will happen no matter how intelligent they sound saying it. If this seems like a good price to you - buy. If not wait for a better one but know you could get burned. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:20:47
Hodl your ETH tight 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:20:21
Dead cat bounce? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:51:55
I agree actually. This has much further to drop IMO. Strap in boys and girls cause things might get rough. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:17:16
This makes bitcoin core look petty af 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:16:19
There’s a jewelry market because we assigned value to it. If one day we decided gold wasn’t cool to wear anymore it would lose said value.
Electronic sure but there are better and cheaper conductors than gold. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:39:45
Don’t listen to this advice 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:22:48
Not buying that was the floor. This has further to go IMO. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:41:58
Good luck. Gemini takes forever to verify 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:14:17
What? You said that in the 1600s and it proceeded to drop another grand. Personally I believe this latest jump is a dead cat bounce before more correcting. Time will tell. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:11:48
The correction has not finished IMO. I think we have a lot further to drop
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:09:18
Why are they idiots? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:14:40
That cost is peanuts compared to being able to buy in $2,000 less. Moving forward I’d use GDAX (your Coinbase credentials will work) as the fees are minuscule. Unfortunately this time your funds probably won’t clear in time. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:51:42
I think you’ll have another chance today 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:00:57
Dude this is how it’s always been. The last couple weeks haven’t felt out of the ordinary in the slightest 
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:31:25
It’s literally bringing people out of poverty in countries whose money isn’t worth anything due to inflation. It serves MORE purpose to people in developing and corrupt countries. See Zimbabwe and Venezuela.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:53:23
While I expect it to drop A LOT further theres no way I’m selling. I’ve been in this space long enough to know that what I expect is 50/50 at best. Hopefully, for your sake, it’s not all the way back when you wake up tomorrow. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:23:43
This is what a bear market feels like 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:32:22
This is a ridiculous statement. Ethereum is the platform and ether is the currency. Ether (the currency) already performs much better than bitcoin in terms of speed and transaction costs. Oh did I mention it is doing this while doing twice the transactions bitcoin currently is? 
As for store of value - please explain what makes Bitcoin better right now because I am not seeing it. Beyond the right now - as soon as Casper is implemented and proof of stake goes lives - Ethereum automatically becomes a better store of value. Free ethers just for hodling? Yes please. 
On top of all this - you mention alt coins are in a bubble. Yes - most will fail but you do realize more than half of these (and dApps) run on top of Ethereum and thus need ether - the same ether you claim isn’t as good of a store of value. When you buy ether your are buying the gasoline that literally runs the entire ecosystem. 
Honestly - as I see it right now - I don’t see a single thing bitcoin has on ethereum aside from first mover advantage. That being said - I am willing to listen and be proven wrong so please hit me with a sound rebuttal. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:22:55
Not trying to sew FUD but this is screaming bear market to me 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:45:20
Of course and that is called dumb money and very very scary for bitcoins future
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:50:30
Excuse me? Bitcoin transaction fees are astronomical right now....
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:12:19
Yes when you do your taxes 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:41:36
Bitcoin is slow af 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:40:52
Lol yeah let’s shit on the company who is basically the entire reason for cryptos incredible bull run this year. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:17:45
Redditor for a week. 
If you think it always just pops right back up you have a lot to learn...
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:16:54
You know Coinbase is the number 1 app in both the Google and Apple app stores right? All new money is going through it. This kind of volume greatly affects the price causing its price to go higher than other exchanges. This happens quite often. This was a bit of an extreme case but it was nothing out of the ordinary 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:24:22
Very fair statement and it’s definitely exciting to be a part of the both. 
Edit - Fuck EOS though 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:39:45
I used to think that. Lately though I’m not too sure. That being said - still incredibly optimistic about the space in general 
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:52:16
Buckle up...
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:48:36
After holding ether from 420 to 120 this feels like an itty bitty dip 
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:08:02
Huh? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:43:24
 And you just lost any and all credibility. Have a nice day. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:30:43
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:12:21
So you support bcash? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:40:22
Strap in!
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:46:34
Coinbase is an exchange that makes their money in fees. It sounds like you need to do your own research before trying to explain bitcoin to someone else. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:19:12
lol I’ll be sure to do just that noob 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:24:41
Strap in this could be where it gets truly ugly 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:08:07
This is textbook correction. Not even close to a really big one yet though 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:00:26
Plus the fact that it just rose 70% in like 5 days... 
Do people around here really not understand that growth like that is not natural or healthy? It’s fun as fuck sure but if you didn’t see a huge correction coming you probably haven’t spent much time in this space or watching markets in general. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:13:56
Ether looks poised for another eruption 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:13:35
Why would he sell everything? I see a dip to the 4 figures coming as well and I don’t plan to sell shit 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:09:41
Of course but after a parabolic rise, people are more likely to panic sell than buy. Think with a Wall Street mind. If something rises 700% in just a few days would you be more likely to short it or long it? 
I’m not saying I think futures is going to crush BTC in the long term. I just think we are in for rockier times in the short term. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:08:49
Haha again - you must be new here.
Nothing goes straight up. Nothing goes straight down. Not how markets work.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:20:56
What if we rephrase the question. WHY do YOU believe BTC is superior to BCH? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:14:41
If only it actually worked that way 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:40:22
This is not how it works at all. You realize price is determined by supply and demand and not the exchange right? Comments like this make me nervous about this parabolic price action
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:09:20
Weak hands 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:20:09
It’s also gone through extended bear markets. To say it always just pops right back up is very, very wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:47:21
What you just said has literally nothing to do with my statement. That being said, while we are on the topic of buying things with bitcoin, sure you can buy stuff with it! You just need to wait 10 hours for it to be confirmed and pay a few that’s more than the cost of the ice cream. Again - fundamentals....
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:22:22
So based on this logic, Ethereum will be  in market cap in no time? Right? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:34:02
Lol nice retort. Keep thinking Bitcoin which is controlled by 5 mining pools and Blockstream is the end all be all of decentralization.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:17:51
Well $15 avg fees and 10 hour transfer times doesn’t provide much utility IMO
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:48:05
You might just not have the stomach for crypto because honestly, this is nothing, and I personally think this has a lot further to drop.  Or it might not. Time will tell. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:11:42
No one knows the answer to this. It has l dropped quite a lot but could it go lower? Absofuckinglutely. If you think the price is good now, just buy would be my advice. Or maybe 50% now and the other half if it drops more.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:37:47
There’s a big difference between investing and trading pal. Investors don’t give a shit about the volatility cause they aren’t selling anyway. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:22:35
Lol why? Because you can’t run a full node on your raspberry pi? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:25:14
Personally I’m EXTREMELY bullish on ethereum.
That being said - seems like you want to do this for the wrong reasons. Don’t FOMO into ethereum because BTC is dropping and ethereum is not. This is a natural cycle for both and it’s best to hold them at the same time :) 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:13:39
Yeah this isn’t true. You do know what the difference is between the two coins right? 
Ethereum has more than twice the traffic of bitcoin and it is 10x faster and 20 times cheaper. Considering Cash’s block size it would probably be the same
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:11:57
And when did you buy for the first time?

Today I have learned that 90% of the people on this board can’t tell me the difference between bitcoin and bitcoin cash - yet also believe that bitcoin cash is ‘garbage’ and ‘a fraud.’ This is basically a sociology project on the power of groupthink! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:56:54
God forbid people have choices 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:40:00
I think we see 4 digits 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:17:01
What’s centralized about it? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:19:31
Insider trading investigation?! You realize crypto is an unregulated market right? This investigation you speak of is being conducted by Coinbase themselves. Nothing illegal was done. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:23:33
Kinda like the influence Blockstream has over core? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:02:01
Spot on. They STILL don’t even have their own blockchain! By the time they do Ethereum will have announced 15 more Fortune 500 companies who want to make the Ethereum vision a reality! 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:08:17
You do realize that ethereum is doing twice the transactions that bitcoin is RIGHT NOW and it’s cheaper and faster right? 
I understand that there is stuff on the horizon but the internal bickering needs to end and progress needs to begin.

You shouldn’t sell at a loss anyway. It sounds like you didn’t know what you were getting into when you bought. This is a crazy fucking ride and there will be periods where your investment drops A LOT. During times like these I buy more. If you aren’t comfortable buying while it’s plummeting than just try and forget about it because it eventually will come back and you’ll look back and laugh at how scared you were that first time. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:32:41
Lol you must be new here 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:56:05
You must be new to crypto 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:32:20
Umm I believe he’s talking about network cost homie. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:34:58
This isn’t done 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:32:24
9K is my guess for the bottom 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:54:27
Lol this isn’t close to that yet 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:22:07
Lol you think ETH is less volatile than bitcoin? 
Redditor for 3 weeks makes perfect sense ��
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:55:03
 Not a damn person in here knows. That being said - if I were a betting man I’d say this is dropping below the teens. Because I think this you should probably buy now 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:28:07
Also -  Believing a correction is coming after a parabolic run is not ‘fud’ it’s realism 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:22:43
Well there are many reasons. The first is that even if you believe something, there’s still probably only a 50% chance it actually happens. This is fucking crypto and those of us who have been in this space awhile recognize that. The second reason is he may not want to pay taxes for gains if he sells. If he believes it will come right back up, why deal with this. Third? He just doesn’t give a shot. This is crypto - 50% corrections happen often.
Edit - I also believe a massive correction is coming. I’m not selling a single thing.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:56:39
Absolutely - no disputing that. Point stands that even before that it was doing over twice as many transactions as bitcoin making the response incorrect. 
Ethereum has a lot of work to do as far as scaling goes (as does bitcoin) and hopefully it’s completed before the 870 dapps currently being developed hit the platform. That being said - the fact that 870 dapps are already being developed for the platform is pretty incredible...
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:10:42
You need to report your gains 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:52:22
There are still huge network fees 
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:49:54
Huh? 3%?!? The S&amp;P 500 returns about 12% on average. This year it’s been on a ridiculous bull run and has almost doubled that average. Prettyyy sure you are thinking about GDP which is doing great when it’s growing at 3%.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:43:26
Yeah it’s what I believe. Speculating on a correction is not FUD. My post history should show I’m very pro bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:56:05
I don’t think so 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:08:20
lol everyone says they’ll buy back in when the price is plummeting but few actually do 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:56:27
Until it’s back down again. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:09:51
Yes - it is always a good idea to hedge. Don’t let maximalists tell you otherwise 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:11:15
Yeah I think it’s got a lot further to drop 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:53:34
Lol at random internet people on reddit damaging the entire ecosystem. It doesn’t work like that....
As for alt coins dropping harder. This makes sense considering their lower market cap. They’ll probably bounce back higher too. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:38:42
What do you plan on doing with them until then? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:42:15
Please - I’ve done this long enough to not do anything besides buy and hodl 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:58:10
Not a chance. By promises from a shady group of people who haven’t even created their own blockchain yet. EOS talks a big game but there’s a big reason most tokens and dApps flock to Ethereum. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:06:02
You could put in 50% in now and if it dips more throw in the rest
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:01:59
It could be bad because it’s fairly easy to manipulate the price. Institutional money can drive up the price of bitcoin, put in a short, and sell. Personally I do think there’s a chance this happened. Time will tell. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:24:55
Volume picking up and very jumpy. Could go either way but I don’t think the bull run is over. We shall see! 
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:26:21
Relax
