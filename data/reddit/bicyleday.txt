If I knew I wouldn't be asking ;) 
So ALL data gets checked and confirmed just as often and thoroughly as it is now, they just split it up into two separate blocks, so to speak? Just seems like that would make it easier to manipulate blocks then (again, I have no idea about the technicalities of how Segwit would get implemented). Also, I'm sure this question has been asked many times before, but why not just increase blocksize then?

The suspense is killing me.

Was just thinking the same thing. Holding bitcoin is risky for Chinese investors now (who knows what the government will do next - maybe they'll declare it illegal and confiscate all coins). So the moment they unfreeze those accounts we are going to see a lot of selling. Same thing happened when they halted trading during their last stock market bubble btw, when people were finally allowed to access their stocks they sold like crazy. 
I'm not sure if it would affect prices in the long run, but definitely something to be aware of. Surprised no one else is talking about this.

Don't listen to that guy! The Chinese government is not invested in Bitcoin. He's probably just trolling (at least I hope so).

That's not a really good comparison. In theory an ETF does hold all the underlying assets, but there are many exceptions now with swap based ETFs and what not. They always do hold something though, unlike bank credit where the majority of it just gets created with no real assets backing it. How it is going to be like with the Bitcoin ETF I have no idea, I actually always assumed they'd buy actual bitcoin 1:1, but now this makes me think. This is something important to know for anyone who wants to invest in that ETF!

Can the witness data then not be compromised more easily?

If by laugh you mean fill you with rage then sure - felt that too!

Those people are idiots. By that logic anything is a pyramid scheme.

Plus free shipping! You're forgetting about the free shipping. Do you get that with your Bitcoin? No, fees are sky high.

Please don't give them any clicks, Bild is Germany's Daily Mail.

Haha, yeah, I chuckled as well. 
Not too surprising, though. At least they didn't mess up anything worse. Those were probably already the digital currency "experts" in their unit. They then went to write a report where they had to dumb down the lingo for their even more technologically illiterate superiors :(

I used to trade when I was still living in China. There were no fees for trading Bitcoin on the major Chinese exchanges. Did this for a few months and made a bit of money. I would have made more than double the amount had I just bought and held. Lesson learned. Don't day trade! Same goes for stocks btw.
But feel free to try it out yourself, of course.
