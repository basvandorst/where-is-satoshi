Bitcoin wasn't invented to destroy or compete with PayPal. Bitcoin was invented to destroy or compete with the central bank. And if you understand how the world runs today and who is really in control you will realize that this Bitcoin changes everything.

Meh they can hard fork in anything that remotely appears to work and their supporters will just run it.
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:11:57
Kind of answered your own question. BTC came first so people already have BTC. Then August comes along and 20% of Bitcoins user base, the short sighted ones, decided they need bigger blocks now and so they fork off. Now everyone who already had BTC because it was first also has BCH. Since the market decided bch has value people are going to spend it. Especially people who think it's a complete dead end Band-Aid coin and probably want to get rid of it by spending it on real s***.

@_date: 2017-12-28 16:48:23
No, it will bring the rise of other altcoins on account of the fact that it can atomically swap in between them with programmatically negotiated exchange rates. That's my prediction anyway. The fact that Bitcoin will still only be able to handle about 7 or whatever transactions per second in it's blockchain, even if all of the transactions going into the blockchain are Channel opens and channel closes there still isn't enough room for everyone in the world to be opening and closing very many channels certainly not at a cheap transaction price. So I think alt coins with low transaction fees will be used to on board into crypto and then people will just use them to make payments through lighting hubs that can shift the value to whatever currency the end recipient wants.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:24:36
When this proves to be harmful you'll be glad that there is no Central Bank of Bitcoin sitting ready to create unlimited new Bitcoins to keep paying people.

How does losing all control of the monetary system benefit them? they can't know how much money any of their subjects has they can't know what the tax liabilities are and they can't follow the money as it moves to any individual people. all they can see is transactions publish to The Ledger they don't know who's doing them they will have to put their entire police force, no draft the entire population, to track transactions and have teams of people watching every other person it will be complete Insanity and totally untenable.
And even if they could prove you owe taxes to them there's really nothing they can do to actually force you to cough up the Bitcoins.

Sadly those of us who want freedom and don't want to be ruled are in a tiny minority. My anecdotal evidence of talking with people suggest they want to be ruled, almost all of them. The evidence shows in the types of governments they repeatedly select. I know there's psychopathic manipulation of the masses coming down through the political authority system however that can't completely explain the plebs continually demanding for the same types of policy on its own.
@_date: 2019-08-06 15:55:18

If you take a job in your country using your tax ID code to get paid then your employer is going to report the fact that you made money to the tax authority and you will be liable for the taxes. does it matter what form of money or paid in the taxes will be due in the native currency of the land. the trick obviously with a Bitcoin salary is to officially get paid a very low rate and then take your bonuses off the books.

The mempool is the group of transactions that have not been included in a block yet. they are fighting for space in the next block and typically the highest bidders aka the ones that want to pay the highest fee will be the ones included, up until the block is mined with as many transactions as the minor can fit in to make the most money off transaction fees. 
so by visualizing the mempool and and recent fees you can get an idea of what kind of fee you might be able to get away with in order to get your transaction included in short order. 
During peak periods of transaction volume fees can go up into the multi dollar range, but during the low times the fees can be practically nil e.g. 2 cents
so depending how much money you're moving it can really pay to have a look at what the lowest fee you could probably get away with is and go with that amount

You lost all claim to them when you handed them over to an entity operating in a foreign jurisdiction.

I would suggest to you that as long as your customer never mentions any illegal activity in any way then your trade should be okay. if your customer starts telling you about the illegal things they are going to do with the bitcoins they buy from you or that they have done with the cash they are trying to give you, it could very well mean you are being subject to a police sting. I personally would abort any trade where the customer mentions any illegal activity at all.

They can make it illegal. they can grant a very large budget to the team of people tasked with enforcing the law. But that's what they did with marijuana. Marijuana was an obscure drug that very small number of people used when it was banned. despite the ban in an ever-increasing prohibition enforcement budget marijuana use flourished.
another thing they could do to harm Bitcoin is out mine the network with empty blocks that don't have any transactions in them. They have the money to literally build unlimited factories producing unlimited Asics they could completely blockade the network if they decided to put money into doing that.
