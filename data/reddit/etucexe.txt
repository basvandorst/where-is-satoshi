Hi! Between personal pick-up versus bank transfer, my personal guess would be bank transfer.
Door to door sending of cash is pretty popular here. I think one popular use-case is for recipients who are unable to travel to a remittance agent, either because of the location of the agent or the capacity of the recipient to travel.

I don't get this sentence.  
We charge a 1% fee. **We don't earn on the exchange rate.** Simple as that.
Even if you obtain your Bitcoin at 6% mark-up  (Coinbase charges 1%, exchanges 0.5%), fee still totals to more than half compared to WU. And that 6% doesn't even go to us. Where's the BS in that?

Hi I'm part of Rebit.ph (SCI).
I'm glad you went through the trouble of testing out our rates. Even more glad our math checked out!
As for the bitcoins we collect, these will soon be used in our other verticals that would need Bitcoin liquidity. We'd love to own as much Bitcoin as we possibly can but, again, you are right that if (and hopefully when) we are successful with Rebit, we wouldn't be able to handle keeping so much Bitcoin without exchanging part of them back to fiat.
Here in the Philippines, there are two M-Pesa type services (Globe Telecom's GCash and Smart Telecom's Smart Money) at the moment, but none of them have been as successful as M-Pesa has been in Kenya. We do have plans to support them should demand rise.

I never claimed Western Union charges PHP 600 on a PHP 1,000 remittance.
Ok, so I tried sending PHP1,000 at westernunion.co.uk to the Philippines. It adds a fee of GBP 1.90 which is PHP 136.12. Their exchange rate is GBP 1.00 is PHP 71.6417441. Googling 1 GBP to PHP gives you PHP 72.53. That's a 1.22% pad on the exchange rate.
Compare 13% + 1.22% in fees for Western Union versus our 1%.

We didn't know about that, a coincidence for sure. We did register our domain a few weeks ago, if that helps clarify the coincidence. 
Congrats on the honorable mention! Would love to connect with you and the team you mentioned had the same idea. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 15:10:29
Well, you seem to be a stickler for a few cents.
@_date: 2014-07-16 06:22:28
Which difference in rate are you referring to? If there is any discrepancy, I will personally cover it. I will even send the same amount to coins.ph. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 06:51:17
So which difference in rate are you so willfully referring to, Ron Hose? I still fail to see why you think we would profit a few dollars over a donation drive that we ourselves have personally donated to.

Uhm, yes?


It's not. It's plus 4% which WE DONT CHARGE. It's Palawan Express's fees and is AN OPTION for you to get your money.
You obviously have 0 clue as to how things are done here in the Philippines. Palawan Express is a chain of pawnshops with remittance services that are found in remote locations that even Western Union does not reach. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, it's not the only last mile delivery we offer. That's actually one of the most expensive ones, because, well it reaches locations some telcos don't even bother putting up cellsites in.
@_date: 2014-07-16 07:25:00
So, is [this]( the discrepancy you're talking about? It's 0.22% which is caused by us caching the prices every hour and it so happened that the caching were not synchronized between the 2 sites.
To give everyone an idea of what "discrepancy" is referring to, the 0.22% comes down to around PHP 35 for the current PHP 15,705 donation. That's USD 0.80 of a USD 360 donation that is claiming we are keeping.

I just got my beta access to Bitreserve. I have a question, Let's say I put 1 BTC ($500/BTC) into my USD Bitcurrency card.
Next day (or month), Bitcoin surges to $1000/BTC. I then want to buy something that is sold for 0.1 BTC. If I use my USD Bitcurrency card, will it be debited $50, which is based on the deposit rate, or $100, which is based on the current rate?
@_date: 2014-07-17 01:58:36
How stupid do you think I am? I never said on any of my posts that I am not part of the team, Ron. In fact I referred to the donation drive that **WE** threw resources on.
@_date: 2014-09-18 06:50:50
If someone flies in from Hong Kong to claim the free pickup in Makati, I will make sure to alert you.  
Thanks for pointing out that our "starts at" label has been rendered inaccurate after we've set the limit to P1,000. That is a mistake and we will fix that.
@_date: 2014-09-19 15:18:51
You can't send less than $10 on there. If you are planning on donating more than that, and you don't have Bitcoin, sure that is the easier way to donate. This post doesn't claim to be the only way to donate.  
I guess Red Cross is expecting a donating of more than $9 from you then?
@_date: 2014-09-19 12:26:44
As opposed to?
@_date: 2014-07-16 15:09:45
I'm sure they're just reacting to the fact that you just accused them of stealing a few cents from a donation drive we just threw resources on.
@_date: 2014-06-30 19:15:02
Thanks for pointing out your service, Ron (I'd like to clarify though, and this is true especially for traditional remittance services: It's not always about the fee. Check the exchange rate as well. See  . This is how they (sometimes deceptively) market themselves to seem cheaper. The exchange rate is where they make their money.
Going back to SendMoney.ph versus Rebit.ph, although we do pad 3% versus your 0%, we still pay out only PhP 94.10 (USD 2.15) or 0.35% less if sending 1 BTC because your BTC to PHP sell rate is lower than ours. (You pay less for a BTC than we do) And all payout options you offer, we obviously can offer. The decision to not offer all those options was based on a usability perspective.
Rates above are taken at the time of posting, I have screenshots of it.
@_date: 2014-09-19 15:21:27
Not sure of the exact amount, but we sent all of what was raised plus some more from our staff. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 18:03:04
Hi! I'm one of partners. I'd like to point out, too that our fee structures will be very different. Not nearly 10% as you are expecting. It won't even be 4%.
Bitmarket.ph, is our payment processing service, one of a number of products we will be introducing really soon. It will be part of a planned ecosystem that revolves around Bitcoin -- this is why we won't be charging more than 4% to enable our merchants.

Hi, I'm part of the Rebit team.
A typical exchange of USD to Bitcoin (Coinbase) would be 1%. So that puts the total cost of sending money at 2%. Bitstamp is 0.5%.
About Western Union, do you mind sharing the settings you used?
I set my location to United States and then chose to send PHP to the Philippines. Money in Minutes. Comparing the USD to PHP conversion (exchange rate) and Google's "1 USD to PHP". As of this posting:
Western Union gives you PHP 42.6076 for every USD 1.00.
The current rate we use is what Google (actually Yahoo but they're the same) gives which is P43.79 for every USD 1.00. That might not seem like a big difference but that's actually a 2.7% mark-up on the exchange alone. The transfer fee they pad is USD 5.00 which is PHP 213.038.
Taking into account the low exchange rate, you actually would have spent PHP 245.79 to send PHP 1,000.00.
We would charge PHP ~~100.00~~ 10.00 and you might have spent an extra PHP ~~10.00~~ more to buy your Bitcoin. So PHP ~~200.00~~ 20.00 versus WU's PHP 245.79. Now that might not sound like a big difference (only around USD 1.00) but if you scale up, WU and other remittance services increase their transfer fees and maintain the low exchange rate (USD 6.00 transfer fee for PHP10,000.00). We stay 1% no matter what.
Mind the exchange rate. WU actually charges you a transfer fee PLUS 2.7% hidden in the exchange rate. transfer fees are at USD 5.00 for PHP 1,000. USD 6.00 to send P10,000.
**STILL TL;DR:To send PHP1,000 Western Union will charge you PHP245.79 in fees. Rebit will charge you P10.00.**
Rebit charges 1%. That's it. We make it clearer here: 
EDIT: I was mistaken. I said we charge P100 for P1000, it's actually P10 only.

Sure, we can even deliver to Crame... this isn't serious, right?

To help with liquidating our Bitcoin, we plan to roll out Bitcoin ATMs around the country. Other than that, there are 2 other specific products we're releasing very soon that's part of our BTC out channels. I'd love to discuss this privately with you, if you'd like. 
@_date: 2014-06-30 19:57:20
This is in the pipeline. Part of our strategy is to obfuscate Bitcoin as a transfer mechanism to those who are not inclined to learning the technicalities.
We're carefully finding and assessing the right partners in different territories. We will also adjust our pricing strategy to take into account whatever fees the remitter may incur in exchanging their fiat to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-09 10:14:18
The exchange rate is set when you click on "Send Money Now" and is locked in for 15 minutes. The 15 minute count down is presented when you click on the "Send Money Now" and you close the QR code pop-up dialog. So to answer your question, if you are able to pay the BTC within the period of 15 minutes, your recipient receives the full peso amount, as you have entered on the "How much do you want to send?" field.
Our risk is effectively limited within the 15 minute window. I hope I was able to answer your question correctly.
@_date: 2014-08-26 09:59:15
Yes, that's true. And we believe this. In our opinion though, in order for our outdated fiat systems to upgrade to the crypto-currency system, there needs to be a "transitional" phase that would require such services as Rebit. (Also Bitpay and our version of it called Bitmarket.ph). Why? Because we can't just quit fiat cold turkey. It just can't happen like that. People need to be eased into the new system first. If and when the time comes that we aren't anymore needed, then we will consider our goals met.
@_date: 2015-01-08 15:25:09
It potentially makes it easier for the customers, not the companies involved.
It also makes it cheaper compared to when the conversion process is done externally via correspondent banks. 
@_date: 2015-11-14 00:08:13


I would disagree with bitcoin stuff adding complexity. Let me give you a scenario that makes Bitcoin useful and keeps the transaction uncomplicated.
Let's assume for a moment that you want to send me $10. You're in the US, I'm in the Philippines. I'm a millennial who doesn't have a bank account, no credit card, but I do have a cellphone. (*Unlikely? Not at all because in the developing world, specifically the Philippines, 80% are unbanked, 95% have no credit cards and we have 110% SIM card penetration.*)
How would you send me the $10? Moneygram would charge you a $10 fee up front, and another 2-5% exchange rate spread. And that would also mean I'd have to spend another $1-5 to commute to the nearest Moneygram branch.
With [Boom Cash]( you can send $10 to me via my [Boom Cash Address](  and I would get the funds in minutes and in Philippine Pesos. No internet connection required on my side. It's also cheaper as Boom Cash's exchange rate spread is currently at 1%. Now, to cash that out will still entail me going to a cash pickup location via [Rebit.ph]( and that part we are still working on improving, but all in all, you already see a huge benefit to having an SMS based Bitcoin wallet. I didn't have to know the complexities of Bitcoin. If you, as a sender, used a service like [Coinbase]( then the Bitcoin parts would have been all under the hood.

Hi, I work with at SCI.
It's pegged to the peso because most users we plan to target can't afford to weather even a dollar or 2 in price volatility. Having said that, there are plans to create just a Bitcoin wallet -- which is actually much easier for us to manage. 
@_date: 2016-07-07 14:30:28
I would think that miners who still incur the same costs to mine would liquidate the 12.5BTC they get rewarded at the same rate as when they got 25 BTC. But then again, the market is a strange black box.
@_date: 2016-07-08 17:32:26
Spot on. Another point: a worldwide remittance network based on an open value transfer protocol such as Bitcoin allows for faster integration among different Bitcoin operators.
disclosure: I'm part of [Rebit]( and what this article says has always been the vision for our product. It can't be free (yet) but we're definitely lowering costs for remittances.
