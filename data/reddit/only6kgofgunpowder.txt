O.K.  So 1.0 do-dahs goes to 0.001 do-dahs?
Doh!  You made it even smaller.
1.0 goes to 1000k do-dahs.
The d.p. moves left.
Which bit of this basic mathematics do you fail to understand?
@_date: 2018-02-13 11:30:39
No way 9k is a ceiling.  Just caused by FUD, Ver, machinations, and an over-ambitious price before X-mas.
The correction - which was inevitable - is essentially over.
Steady climb from here on.
20k by mid-year.

There's a fascinating battle going on around 11k.  I think the erect green dildo's will defeat the red smears at some point tonight.
15k baby born by Friday.

I see BCash is now 7th for trading volume.  Such news always gives me a warm feeling.
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:45:49
Don't go down the BCash ignoramus route please: the correct grammar is 'fewer and fewer.'
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:56:51
There's a high probability.  
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:31:16
As I predicted.  11k by CoP tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:58:36
Do you mean Dr Craig Hatamoshi Fuckiwanker Satiwoshi?  
He has a PhD in - wait for it - Theology.
(Not much blockchain creation going on in religion, as far as I know.  He's a good mate of that Ver cunt.)

I just wish I'd sold all my honest coin for Shitcoin Cash.  I would love to experience that loss of credibility and money.
@_date: 2018-02-18 18:51:00
Interesting, but is this real?  
Needs a thorough fake news check I think.
@_date: 2018-02-17 13:04:31
Probably too much info in the public domain for a patent.
The Bcash shillers have all these stupid conspiracy theories.  
If there were anything dishonest about BTC they could have patented..
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:51:41
Hmm.  Not so sure.
@_date: 2018-02-18 18:47:36
Really nice work.
What you should do is collect all the parts together and sell them as a DIY package on Ebay.  I'd buy it.

One solution is to put your gf on the game for Monero, then gradually convert it to BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:50:05
I hate the BBC, with a passion - but they are not under UK government control.  Certainly not directly.
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:55:38
Don't short BTC.  Just hold it.  Short shitcoins.
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:41:21
I just want them to inform me - not push an extreme liberal agenda. 
Every other story is about women's rights - you would think nothing else was happening in the world.
@_date: 2018-02-18 18:26:18
Roger Ver admires LN.
He knows it is a huge threat to the entire BCash scam, and has even claimed in the past that it will work better with BCash than with BTC.
AND IN REGARDS TO LIGHTNING NETWORK AND THEIR PLANS FOR FUTURE SCALING, ALL THOSE THINGS THEY WANT TO DO IN REGARDS TO LIGHTNING NETWORK AND LAYER TWO WILL WORK BETTER, FAST R, AND CHEAPER ON TOP OF BITCOIN CASH BECAUSE THERE'S MORE ROOM IN THE BLOCKS FOR EVERYTHING TO HAPPEN AND THE BLOCKS WILL BE HAPPENING MORE RELIABLY AND THE TRANSACTIONS WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE BLOCKS MORE RELIABLY.
Not my caps. There are also similar views in his previous Twitter posts on the subject.

How about Virtual Insanity (Jamiroquai), converted to
VERtual Insanity 
with some BCash failure memes.
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:31:49
Yep, this has been happening.  
But the value quoted is a made up figure.  50 million?  Nah.
500k maybe.
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:22:18
You mean moving the decimal to the left?
@_date: 2018-02-17 20:54:53
Are you ready for this?
The tip of an iceberg is small, due to ice having a lower density than water.  About 1/9 of seawater.
So you see about 1/9 of the actual iceberg.  Most of it is hidden underwater, and that is not a good thing: it is a bad thing.  
Because - well, you've seen the movie.
So 'tip of the iceberg' is rather a menacing thing, rather than a good thing.
Edit: obviously it is not 1/9, must be 9/10.  Anyway, you get the idea.

Public minded and good of you to post this.
You're right - there will be 1 in a 1000 who did do something they're ashamed of recently, and some of them will cough up.
Credit for posting.

I have no idea.  Embarrassingly, my Mum, who is to the cryptoworld what Ver is to honesty, called me and told me it was on.
(She is worried that over xmas I lost a girlfriend, and 50,000 USD.)

Heh!  :)
@_date: 2018-02-15 09:16:08
Have they been buying BCash?

See my name on these boards - he claims he only sold a few grams of gunpowder.

You need a TV license in UK to watch iPlayer, and ANY live TV - even if it does not originate in the UK.
@_date: 2018-02-18 18:30:05
Well that would fuck up all your other payments too!  You silly sausage.
@_date: 2018-02-17 21:08:17
Doh!  OK.
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:43:32
Oh, fuck off, BCash shitcoiner.
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:47:56
Hmm.  Like I care :)
I just believe in honesty mate.
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:55:51
Brilliant.  But I don't fancy those beans.
@_date: 2018-02-13 09:33:19
Would you pay this govt tax just to watch Blue Planet and Sherlock?  They are both excellent, I agree, but people outside the UK have the option to watch these by pay to view.  I'd rather have that option.
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:38:44
It is not quite correct to state that the BBC is 'owned' by the UK government.
It has its own charter and leadership, and is often in conflict with the sitting government.
It is also ultra-liberal.
Nevertheless, if you mean it is a massively trusted and far reaching news organisation, you are correct.
@_date: 2018-02-18 20:10:44
Interesting.  Shame it wasn't the sentiment mid-Dec 2017!
@_date: 2018-02-18 20:38:02
It is biased nonsense, based upon numerous false premises about the growth of networks.
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:15:38
Because I would be forced to buy a TV licence.  I could get away with it, but as a matter of principle I won't watch any live TV in the UK, because you have to pay the government for it (Even if it is not BBC.)
@_date: 2018-02-13 11:32:36
Short-term trading BTC is a mug's game.
Short altcoins; not a big unpredictable beast like BTC that is essentially medium to long term.
@_date: 2018-02-13 10:08:17
BBC pays for Blue Planet partly through our absurd taxation for having a TV, but also because these top quality shows sell very well throughout the world and pay for themselves.
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:21:35
One of Ver's mates.
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:47:48
That PhD in God-bothering must have been seriously useful when he 'invented the blockchain'.
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:39:03
Possible hatchet job.
BBC is a schizophrenic mix of ultra-liberal and establishment.
So who knows how it will come out?
No doubt a bit of a pump tho.
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:47:25
Er.  But but is not impartial to point out that economically, socially, militarily, diplomatically Brexit will be a disaster for Britain.
That's not impartiality, it is the truth,
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:25:20
And his shoulders are very narrow.  In fact, I'm not sure he has shoulders.  I think he is just a mad head on top of a BCash T-shirt.
@_date: 2018-02-17 20:27:41
Er, not a good metaphor, but I am with the sentiment.
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:51:28
How shall I do that, without accelerating time, master?

THIS is may favourite comment.
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:36:30
Who knows - I don't really care.  Just keep my BTC and Monero.
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:35:45
No.  The British Broadcasting Corporation wouldn't interview a cunt like Ver.  (Probably.)
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:42:12
Nope.  But it doesn't matter.
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:57:35
Could you also rig one up to do it by Shitcoin Cash transaction for comparison?
@_date: 2018-02-11 21:48:42
What's your thing with buying coffee Shitcoiners?
Do you realise that 99.999% of the population don't give a shit?
@_date: 2018-02-24 00:51:24
The only risk I would be concerned about (and also a reason to hang onto private keys or seeds) is that there may be unclaimed airdrops that occured when your coins were in that location.
I almost threw away the seed to an old wallet, then realised there were several hundred dollars worth of shitcoin there, which I successfully claimed.
So your old keys/seeds don't need ultra-security, IMO, but keep hold of them somewhere.  I keep mine in a 'Legacy' folder in one of my secure storages, just in case.
@_date: 2018-02-18 20:29:39
I'm confused now.  
Is BCash the shit coin with the green logo?  Or the shitcoin with the orange logo?
We need Roger Ver to jump in, stick up his middle finger, and explain what is going on.
I'll pop over to r/btc and ask.  They know all about shitcoins.
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:27:05
Everytime I have sold BTC, it has been a mistake, and because of some FUD on Reddit.
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:32:50
Agreed.  I've asked for redditors to put it on youtube.
I'm not paying a cent to the BBC.
@_date: 2018-02-17 20:56:00
I predicted 11k last Tuesday - but I was out by a day.
@_date: 2018-02-18 14:06:17
Unless there's some disastrous FUD, I can only see it go higher.  15k by next weekend? - I wouldn't be that surprised - but there again :)
@_date: 2018-02-18 19:11:50


Yep.  Looks legit.  A cryptocurrency search on their site brings up the article.
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:10:40
I remember the excellent meme.
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:44:48
I think the journalists are extremely biased, and largely stupid, but that's just the trends in education moving into our lives.
I'm not sure the organisation itself is under government control - it is just out of control with its own meandering philosophy.
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:27:53
The Beeb are ultra-liberal, but all mixed up with authority - a bit of a totalitarian post-modernist mess.
But they try desperately to be even handed and unbiased.
So it will be a pump economically.
@_date: 2018-02-14 10:08:40
Agreed.  Before x-mas the prices were climbing exponentially.  That simply couldn't go on forever.  I expect a good steady climb from here on.
@_date: 2018-02-17 12:18:17
Let's imagine that BCash (a.k.a Vercoin Wank or Shitcoin Cash) tried to implement LN.
What would be the point - if BTC is already running it?
Their malodorous lying coin would be even more irrelevant than it is now.
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:10:17
He is right, by accident - major UK TV current affairs, Panorama - BBC, about BTC. 2030 GMT.
Watch the natural pump.
(Thank me later - or upvote me - I fucking need it, after all the hammering I get from BCash Ver lickers.)

You need a TV license to watch all iPlayer content, and also anything live whether it is BBC or not.  You could only legally watch a BBC program if it were streamed non-live by another channel.

Ver wrote to me you know - but I can't find it now!
