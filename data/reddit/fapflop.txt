What is the benefit? How are sidechain transactions being verified, if not by the bitcoin network?
If you're saving yourself from downloading the main chain, how will the side chain not grow to the same size?

It's all dictated by the bitcoin protocol/algorithm that everyone agrees on. In that algorithm, it dictates that whoever finds the next valid block gets a reward of an amount is determined by the block number.

They were worth somewhere between 6-8 cents each in that timeframe. $15 would net you just shy of 200 BTC, or $48,000 at the time of this post.
Edit: As far as your second question goes, you would want to pay the tax man his share when you cashed out, so it would depend on your tax bracket. 
Also, you can open an account with Coinbase to sell your coins. Given the amount, you may want to contact both Coinbase and your bank to let them know you're about to get a large deposit.

Always send a miner's fee. It may be a while before you get your six confirmations. In the mean time, do some googling on how to pull your transactions out of limbo due to not sending a fee.

Maybe they can use the extra time to make the search and general usage less terrible.
For instance, aside from searching specific models, I don't know how to browse graphics cards. "Graphics Computing Systems" has nothing in it.
Another example is searching for 'AMD CPU' doesn't bring back any processors, but going to "Microprocessors" brings up *two* AMD manufacturer categories. After that, I can't select socket type or anything.
Needs a lot of work.

Incorrect. No coins ever go into any "wallet." Nothing is held anywhere. When you send coin to someone, you're saying "I release these coins to x address, Signed MonkeyDeathCar." When you want to spend those, THAT'S when you'll need to connect to the internet. Your wallet will download the blockchain and say, "Oh hey, a few months ago I was given x amount of coin." That's when you can spend/sign those coins to another address.

The average Joe likely has no use for bitcoin at the moment. Why should he use bitcoin when he can just use PayPal like everyone else?
Bitcoin is most useful* for those who want to move money across borders or want a store of value that might also appreciate with time.
For the average Joe, there's Coinbase, its app, and the service it provides. That's good enough for him.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but if there are no confirmations and blockchain.info wallets are having an issue (which they seem to be), you can import your private keys into a different wallet (that isn't blockchain.info) and resubmit the transaction.
No, there is no help service. If you're getting 0 confirmations, then the transaction was never submitted. Worse case scenario is your second transaction from the new wallet is rejected from the network because your first one finally went through.

It's a bummer, too. I was just about to give Mt.Gox a chance as my verification is coming around.
Back to CampBX..

As someone that just went through YYZ on Monday, fuck that place. They're all assholes.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:06:48
I just pooped.
@_date: 2013-03-29 16:28:39
Are there any other services like that? I'm wondering how pretty much every transaction I look at seems to be shuffled.

This may be stupid simple, but I just want a context menu for Chrome that look up a highlighted address on Blockchain.info.
@_date: 2013-04-01 14:23:36
Yes. You can buy .0001 BTC for $0.01 if you want to.
Anywhere that sells bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-14 15:32:00
They accept bitcoin?
Well that makes me an idiot.
@_date: 2013-04-17 12:51:02
So.. this bet's event date is off by a week.. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:47:37
I could see that being used to make a cast for a more durable material.

You're not using your bank account with the cash deposit option. What you do is start the deposit on Bitfloor, and it'll give you a total amount (with a 1-4% fee applied). Go to a teller and ask for an out of state deposit slip, and fill it out with the information that was emailed to you when you created the deposit. Turn in the deposit slip with cash.
I did this yesterday and the funds were in my account within 5 minutes of depositing.

I feel that more people should be looking at the 1 day period on carkmoody rather than the hour or minute periods.

Bummer. Sophos has your site flagged for malware.
@_date: 2013-03-30 02:52:53
Not at all. I get about 0.025 BTC a day with a 6870 and a GTX 660.
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:34:18
Anyone have a recommendation for a type of paper to print this on? I would want it to be waterproof and possibly tear proof.
Same goes for printing paper wallets.
@_date: 2013-11-14 13:26:54
One bottled fart, please!
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:19:31
Are you asking reddit for financial advice?
@_date: 2013-10-30 22:44:47
There's an emblem creator for the game. You can make whatever you want with the shapes they give you. This emblem has 18 layers of squares and circles.
@_date: 2013-05-14 20:57:52
Time to step up, CampBX.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:41:54
Yep. 
@_date: 2013-05-17 19:03:17
I'm down with that.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:00:05
Correction is the word you're looking for.
@_date: 2013-02-28 23:37:51
You said you wanted to buy in at $1.
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:00:26
Sitting at 213 mBTC right now. Dude's making bank.
@_date: 2013-02-28 01:06:02
I don't think anyone's dropping $48M in bitcoins anytime soon.
@_date: 2013-08-26 22:30:28
Eh, wouldn't they still need to report sales tax?
@_date: 2013-10-18 21:58:56
Your face is killing me.
@_date: 2013-04-23 18:05:22
Using it as a light savings account, and have spent the rest on weapon attachments and other accessories.
@_date: 2013-03-30 03:49:54
I was agreeing with you. 
@_date: 2013-05-10 22:33:49
One of the more significant brands on there for me is Papa Johns. My first goal when I started to mine a couple of months ago was to get enough to buy a pizza using bitcoins.
Using pizzaforcoins was going to cost me over $30 for a large pepperoni and some cheesy bread. Now I can get a gift card at 0% markup and pay actual price.

That's because it's irrelevant. The code is open source.
@_date: 2013-04-25 17:31:39
You mean to tell me that you don't want to narrow down your processor selection by selecting one of five manufacturers named Intel?
Edit: Damn, I was going to provide a link to how ridiculous it is, but it looks like they just broke their site.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:31:24
This guy knows what's up. ;)
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:10:34
Yes, the bubble is popping. They'll be back down to $15 shortly.
Tell you what, I'll make you a deal and buy your coins for double the value. $30, what do you say?
@_date: 2013-11-23 18:40:57
Perhaps an NFC tap would speed things up a tad.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:48:04
It doesn't work that way. You're "rolling the dice" to get a number that the system will accept. You could think of it as trying to roll a 3 or lower on a 512 sided die. You need to join a pool.
@_date: 2013-04-22 20:52:15
Recommends for speedy confirmation. Not required.

It stopped updating for me the other day. Only at work, though. :(
@_date: 2013-06-04 13:34:35
Your reward based on your contribution against the pool's speed. Your reward getting halved would imply that the pool's speed has doubled while your speed hasn't.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:09:56
@_date: 2013-04-02 14:55:38
Excellent, thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:45:52
Yes, please.
@_date: 2013-10-20 18:49:12
I think you need to see a doctor.

Don't watch the SOPA hearings.
