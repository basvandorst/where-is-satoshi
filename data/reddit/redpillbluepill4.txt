Investors, and most people, fear uncertainty. Facebook kicked the hornet nest, and now we don't know the extent that crypto will be regulated. I agree, that in the long term regulation could be good for price. But right now, it seems like a big question mark. Congress could tax the shit out of crypto or require much more strict KYC with all parties in any transaction, etc etc. They don't have to outright ban it. If crypto is so regulated that every bank/merchant/person that transact in crypto is watched (and banned at will), then bitcoin becomes worth less than cash and gold, which at least cannot be tracked.
@_date: 2019-07-18 20:03:16
It's short for government regulated. Regulated alone can refer to anything, bitcoin blocks or taking a shit. Bitcoin is not government regulated as a network, the way that banking is.

@_date: 2019-07-30 19:35:46
Ok, but when the government tries to pass laws banning bitcoin, they aren't going to care about the kind of cyclical regulation that exists with bitcoin. They will only care about government regulation. Semantics isn't going to help the situation. Truth is, that it's amazing that the government allows bitcoin to be legal. And if we pretend that the government can't or won't regulate it much more than it has been, we will be deluding ourselves to our own risk. The US government is practically all powerful, basically running the world financial system through banking but more importantly military power and sanctions. That being said, any US citizen is free to move to another country, such as somalia or Russia, where the laws might be different.

I think at this point taking out a loan is riskier than when bitcoin was $100. The chance of bitcoin going 100x in next 10 years is pretty low.
Having said that, if the loan is low pressure then it's probably a good bet with the halving coming up.

@_date: 2019-11-22 08:59:13
Mining difficulty has nearly tripled in the last year. I seriously doubt that there will be a huge sell off. 
Miners can't afford to sell cheaper.
HODLers would be stupid to sell cheap with six months until the halving. I believe it could theoretically go into the low 6000s but I don't see how supply and demand would currently allow it to go lower. Unless the government seriously started talking about banning it.
@_date: 2019-11-22 09:31:52
Except that miners must double the price they sell bitcoin for after the halving. They must, because they're getting half as much bitcoin. Well... Technically if there was a massive Exodus of miners and the difficulty decreased quickly some could survive. But more likely the price will increase.

There's a million reasons to give up Bitcoin, even though it will go up:
1. You need to buy food, clothing, shelter, cars, boats, jewelry, iPhone, or any real good. 
2. You're retired and ready to spend. 
3. You need to pay taxes in USD
4. You need to do business with any entity that doesn't accept bitcoin.
5. You need small change to buy coffee.
Most things go up in value over time. Yet people sell gold, homes, classic cars, and Bitcoin.

You're right, brain fart. Each person would have about $171.00 if there's 1.2 Trillion USD in cash. 
Or they would have $1500 if you include all the digital USD in banks (M2 money), not just the cash and coin USD.
If there's about $85,000,000 worth of bitcoin (17 million @ $5000), that leaves each person with $12 worth, or .0024 bitcoin each person.

From my Cultural Anthropology Class today:
"Also, modern transportation, telecommunication technology, and electronic cash transfers make it possible for diasporic communities all across the globe to interact with relatives and friends who have settled elsewhere, as well as with their country of origin. Today, most migrants reach across the miles to loved ones, sharing news as well as emotional and financial support. **Worldwide, electronic transfers to developing countries total about $440 billion per year (World Bank, 2015)."**
$440 Billion per year is being sent personally to developing countries. Think about that.

learn about dollar cost average. Don't spend all your money at one time. 
Personally, I don't think it will go below $3,000. If it does, it won't be hard to find $1,000 to buy another 1/3 bitcoin will it?
If it goes to $2,000 then $500 will get you .25 bitcoin. Pretty good deal! The cheaper it gets, the easier it is to buy with pocket change.

Maybe, I would have to study that to give an opinion. But the bottom line is still the same: Bitcoin will essentially stop inflating compared to USD or gold (assuming that gold doesn't run out). 
And given that there is only enough bitcoin EVER for each person on earth to have about .001 bitcoin each, Bitcoin will be scarce indeed.
@_date: 2018-11-26 05:42:02
Except that Bitcoin supply will never actually 2x. To reach 2x would be about 35,000,000 Bitcoins. In 19 years, there will only be around, what, 20,000,000 bitcoin? I know that you put the 2x figure based on the current rate. But you didn't include the halving of the rate every few years. So the 2x figure of 19 years is not really accurate or meaningful. 
Good post overall, though. Instead of 19 years in the bitcoin column, I would just put N/A.

Bitcoin and dollars have no intrinsic value. 
That doesn't mean they don't have value to the degree people believe in them. 
If the US government was gone, USD would have almost no value overnight. Gold would, even if no government existed. But most of golds value is in our minds.
Bitcoin needs no government. But it only has the value we assign to it. Still, it's a limited supply as long as it's not hacked. Therefore it could be viewed as digital gold, with no value as jewelry.

First, when you buy a house the bank usually creates the money out of thin air. They do this by creating two entries in the banking system. One for the 300k debt, and one for the 300k in their checking account which gets sent electronically to the seller. 
I'm not exactly sure how Bitcoin loans work, but bitcoins can't be created out of thin area at will. So it will be harder to get a Bitcoin loan for a house, unless it's some kind of alternate accounting system, derivative, etc. 
Bitcoin is really more like gold than people realize (potentially).

I think what's really amazing is that bitmain didn't just keep the original bitcoin cash chain. After CR forked, bitmain could have supported the original chain and kept bch as bch. 
But now everyone just thinks bitmain and crypto enthusiasts are idiots. 
Even if you hate bcash, having someone as known as bitmain get into a war really looks stupid.

You know that when it crashed to $200 around 2014 it lost more than 80% of its value, right?
You still haven't explained why its a worse investment now. You say nobody wants it, yet its value is far higher than 5 years ago and its acceptance worldwide is increasing.
Again, you would have sold at every crash.

BTW, there's still bitcoin atms in my neighborhood, there's still big players like nasdaq, nyse, fidelity getting into the game. I'm still using bitcoin online.
For some reason, the market has lost its mind. But this will pass. 
I'm pretty positive there's at least:
5 million people in the U.S. who will hold an average of 1 bitcoin long term at $3000 or $4000
4 million in Europe 
8 million in Asia and rest of the world
Of course, if there's lost coins then those figures can be lower.

P.S. My bitcoin investment has lost value since I got in. I'm okay with that. I like the project and I like crypto. I think it's got a bright future in the long run.

If bitcoin kept giving out lots of coins still, the value would hardly rise. It's good that it's scarce. A lot of those early coins are lost or sold a long time ago anyhow.

Bitcoin as an investment has historically had three qualities:
1. High risk to reward ratio
2. High volatility, with deep gains and deep losses (partly due to manipulation).
3. Over the long run it has given much higher returns than the stock market.
99% of the trolls on here don't understand the above.
Like I said before, put on your big boy (or girl) pants and take the time to actually understand what you invested in before you start crying here on reddit.

Good Lord, why did you invest all your money in bitcoin? Literally everyone said don't invest money you need for survival.

Good strategy. Buy high sell low.

Given that bitcoin is being sold below the cost of mining... We're probably near the bottom. I don't know who's selling but I can't imagine it going on too much longer. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 01:11:13
If you bought bitcoin because you believe in the long term value in the world, and you're able to hold fit at least another year, then do. 
If you feel almost certain that bitcoin is unlikely to ever make a comeback, then sell. 
I still believe in the fundamentals long term so I hold.

It doesn't have to be faster or cheaper. That's why some merchants do accept it. Still, I think it will mainly be digital gold. I see no reason that it has to be used for a daily transaction.

Where's the HODLer ???
@_date: 2018-12-07 21:13:05
Right... If you factor in whales then my scenario is even better. If whales hold half the bitcoin, then you only need 8.5 million regular people to each hodl 1 coin each at $3000 - $4000 for us to move back up. 
8.5 million is about 1 out of every 1000 people. Or 1 out of every 100 people in a wealthy industrialized nation.

.05 bitcoin is significant. 
Economic models show that it's not unrealistic that someday bitcoin could reach $50,000. 
.05 of that is $2500
You can also buy more now. Then if it goes to $6000 you break even. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 07:13:52
The problem with panic selling is that you do better in the short term, but in the long term you lose to the hodlers unless you buy back in at the right time. 
Just ask anyone who sold at $300 and never re bought.

Who's fudding on here?
Your complaints of price decrease aren't relevant unless you actually hold bitcoin. 
But if you hold bitcoin then you shouldn't be spreading FUD , because that hurts the price of your asset. 
Conclusion: fudders on here don't own bitcoin. Your FUD isn't relevant to us in the game.

Except you don't know when to get back in. And wham bitcoin is at 7k again and you lose.
Long term hodlers don't need to day trade. 
Oh and for every person who sold at 6k recently there's someone who sold at 1k and bitcoin went up. Just cause you got lucky doesn't mean selling is always the best strategy.

People need to understand percentage declines.
If we say 85% of bitcoin's value has been lost since ATH. 
And then we say that it's gone down 10% in 24 hours. 
That doesn't add up to 95% loss from ATH. That's because 10% from $4000 is only $400. Whereas 10% from 20,000 is $2000.
Bitcoin could lose 10% of it's value every 24 hours FOREVER and still have value.
It could only lose 10% of value from ATH for two days before reaching zero.

Does anyone think it's possible that an exchange, such as bitfinex, is flooding the market with fake bitcoin? 
Suppose you were the ceo of tether and knew you were going to prison. Would you flood the market with fake bitcoin to get a bunch of cash and dissapear?
By fake bitcoin, I mean when an exchange sells people bitcoin that don't exist on the blockchain... They only exist as entries in the exchange's ledger. 
I mean, that's how ponzi schemes work. I know bitcoin isn't a ponzi scheme, but exchanges can easily run ponzis.
