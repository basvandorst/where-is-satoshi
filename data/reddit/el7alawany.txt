First of all thank you for your opinion. 


How ? can you explain please.


I don't think so .. 
1- they can burn and print.
2-people can't totally replace cash.
3- in the current situation of the crypto market i can buy bitcoin from otc market without affecting price that much the only way to make a big difference is to trade on exchanges site  which of course haven't that much of btc at the end. 
4- and they can prevent btc trading which will effect the market and of course without any imaginary dreams we are fully under government control and what's the point when only some people in some country can benefit from btc .
5- And of course the big one if government restricted mining operation they can just attack with 51% and of course they can. 


OK i agree that's will become true at the end but why Russia and China will go to crypto ??!! i don't think that will happen at all .. why not just print Fiat and cover it with gold ? is not enough? and for sure that's a good solution once bitcoin have a problem that's the lost wallet can't be restored that's economically a huge problem .


I hope we can go further . but holding isn't enough the real value will grow when btc  Subject to supply and demand .
