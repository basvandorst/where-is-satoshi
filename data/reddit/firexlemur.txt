Don't be so down on yourself. I let my wife talk me out of making a large BTC investment at $130, and when it broke $800 I was a wreck for 2 days. I decided I would rather risk losing, than risk not winning. I quickly got my shit together, signed up on Coinbase where verification is quick, and you can get 1BTC/day instantly after submitting an ID and proof of address. I bought in at over $800, and I am happy that I did.
There's a Japanese proverb for this: The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is right now.

No good news – my money is gone, and BTER is impossible to contact.
From the looks of my situation and everyone else's posts, BTER certainly appears to have been selectively scamming users for at least the past couple weeks.

You are absolutely right, I am an idiot for using that site. Once glance at their page gives a number of red flag indicators, yet I had used them successfully for smaller transactions so had a false sense of security. I was in a hurry to place a trade, and didn't want to endure the lag at Cryptsy. Lesson learned. At least I learned it with $2k instead of 10 or 20...

This article incorrectly states that "China has barred trading in Bitcoin". I wish these people would do a little research before posting such garbage.

At the risk of sounding like the Grinch, this smells like a holiday scam! Although you did make sure to emphasize that it's "not a scam" in the second sentence, and also made sure to include a lengthy explanation of the fresh posting account with no history.

ISSUE RESOLVED, and bounty goes to bluegreen over at quark.cc forum, who provided me with the QQ number for BTER. I was unable to find their contact info, until I followed his instructions, and clicked the chinese flag on their site, then deciphered the customer service addresses and contacted them via QQ using Google Translate. Funds were promptly returned... God what an adventure.

Careful taking cryptocurrency advice from someone who can't even keep a web site up...

Same issue here. BTC deposit from over 2 days ago still not credited to my account.
Any news or contact from support?
@_date: 2013-12-14 02:41:51
Thanks – I sent this user a message, and will be sure to post here if I ever receive a response. However, I have been emailing their support for days, with no reply :(
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:39:14
Yeah, I shouldn't have used caps. It seems to attract trolls with CamelCase user names.














@_date: 2013-12-14 02:13:20
Yes, no contact from support after many emails, and the address is correct. I can see the funds were received, and subsequently transferred. It was even shown on my account as "processing" for over 24 hours before it disappeared.
@_date: 2013-12-12 05:45:52
Yes, it was confirmed all over the blockchain many times. I can follow the trail where it was transferred by them through several other addresses into a larger holding wallet that was flagged as "hot".

Thanks man, I appreciate it.

It's a shame they were able to get that site listed – The people listing these sites should at least take 2 minutes to make sure it's legit before endorsing it as part of the event. The childish web design, unbelievable prices, lack of a phone  and broken English on the "About" page are the kind of red flags I recommend keeping an eye out for next time.
@_date: 2013-12-14 02:41:01
I have – still waiting for a response. I am not very hopeful, however.
@_date: 2013-12-27 21:37:41
Would a Chinese speaker please summarize what this basically implies in regards to Bitcoin. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-12 03:15:01
Yes, here's a link to the transaction:
@_date: 2013-12-12 03:30:11
See my post above – I had 2BTC disappeared on me by BTER.com in this manner, and then sent a small test transaction for .001 that went through right away. It certainly looks like selective scamming to me.
@_date: 2013-12-08 19:55:11
Seems like bad publicity for Bitcoin. I stopped watching when he asked for "5 bucks" to join his mailing list.

Sure, here it is:

THIS IS A SCAM.
Just in case anyone is stupid enough not to realize.
THIS IS A SCAM.

About 15-20% BTC, with some Litecoin and Quark as well, the rest in cash. I have a good income flow, and will continue to invest in cryptocurrency as long as the market is this viable. 
I'm glad the "sane person without a gambling problem" below doesn't have any say in my financial decisions... Good luck getting 5-10% annual return on your boring fiat investments :)

I wish I had seen this post earlier, because I just sent $2000 worth of BTC to this site yesterday, that disappeared and was never credited to my account.
Here is a link to the transaction:
It leads to an address flagged as a "hot wallet" containing 50BTC, so I am assuming I have been ripped off.
