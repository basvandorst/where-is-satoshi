Yes. Gox withdrawals went completely offline around $100 or whatever right before it hit $1200.  I'd much rather have control of 64% of my funds right now with the vesting token or whatever then trying to get back less than half of that three years from now after a gigantic bull run has already happened. The chart setup is very similar.  We are already creeping up on the previous all-time high again.

If this goes to bankruptcy you'll be begging to get 5-10% back 3 years from now after BTC hits new all time highs and crashes again.  Ask people who were on Gox.  The lawyers will take nearly half of what remains, and governments will take most of the rest.  Pick up the pieces and move on.  Don't cut off your nose to spite your face.

The state is not your friend. We need to keep governments and lawyers out of this as much as possible. No single solution is going to satisfy everyone. I had no Bitcoin at all on the exchange, just USD... &amp; I will gladly take a haircut and allow them to roll back the most kick ass margin position I have ever placed if that means we can keep this out of bankruptcy.  If you want security, go make 5 percent a year in the stock market and lose most of that to taxes and inflation.

No, Bitcoin plunges after it is way over-bought by less informed buyers during the halving.  It over-shoots the LRMA by a tiny bit after the finex hack.  Correlation is not causation.  It was going to happen regardless of the hack.
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:54:17
Anyone who thinks they can take this to court or bankruptcy and come out with better than a 36% haircut... I invite you to wish in one hand and crap in the other and see which one gets filled faster.  Cut your losses and get your head back in the game before Bitcoin hits new all time highs.

Funny, until you get BitMex'd one day.  Kicking traders while they are down won't net you new customers.  Would have been a great opportunity to explain how Mex is different in a polite and to-the-point manner.  This actually makes me less interested in BitMex.

Of course I was speaking very generally, but you have to consider all of the other costs taking this into bankruptcy. Anyone complaining about this right now can wish in one hand and crap in the other and see which one gets filled first.

Current Thoughts.
1.  I once accidentally sent BTC to a tether address, and the exchange fixed it because tether essentially uses the BTC blockchain (correct me if I'm wrong) and they were able to manually change the private ledger on their end.  In the event that the core chain doesn't have enough hash power to thrive, is tether equipped to handle that? I assume so , because it's centralized. 
2.  In that event, it's possible that we could see extremely high btc fees and block times... how will that affect Tether's settlement across exchanges?  I would imagine large Arbitrage opportunities would exist for tether between exchanges.
3.  Tether has actually done a pretty good job of holding the peg over the last two large price movements, however it has fluctuated about $0.20 within that time frame, and about 0.10 during each of those price shocks.  I'm interested and how well it will hold during the occurrence of a Black Swan event, perhaps a bitcoin price drop of 50% or more in which we see cascading margin calls.
EDIT:  in regards to your question, take a look at commanding heights when it discusses the Mexican peso crisis. When you have a currency pegged to another, when Supply or demand rapidly changes for one of those currencies, but not the other, massive triangular arbitrage opportunities will exist.  People like George Soros have made their money draining central banks of their reserve funds during these times.

Lol, all in right before the bubble bursts and we retest $1200 - $2800.  Best of luck.  Hope you know how to short BTC.

Take a glance at a few historical charts. This was to be expected. Look at the one week chart. We're still above the moving average.  We're not going to hit $6000 in an hour. It will take months if not another year.
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:53:38
I don't disagree with your assessment, but that's not the point of this post. The question is quite simply, how would a potential Fork or 51% attack affect tether and its ability to peg the dollar?
@_date: 2015-08-02 02:16:04

I'm a big BitUSD fanboy, admittedly.  But honestly, the thought just popped into my brain this morning.  Not meant to spread FUD, but to get honest opinions on the matter. Hoping someone with a deeper knowledge of tether could actually put these fears to rest.  
Edit:  In regards to due diligence, I have a pretty good understanding the Mexican peso crisis, and there's a reason why bank-pegged currencies make me squirm.  IMHO, BitUSD is a much more elegant approach. But at the moment, that's neither here nor there.

I have a pretty good understanding the Mexican peso crisis and pegged currencies in general (aka the effects of price controls during shocks), and there's a reason why bank-pegged currencies make me squirm.  IMHO, BitUSD is a much more elegant approach, and I'm admittedly a fanboy, but at the moment, that's neither here nor there.  I'm not here to spread FUD, I'm genuinely interested in other people's opinions on the matter who have a deeper understanding of tether at the moment.

I understand how margin works. Trust me, I'm bullish on Bitcoin long run, but we're going to have to retest the 1w 20 period MA at some point.  It's gonna happen.

Get a trusted VPN and connect from a remote country.  There aren't any decent platforms for US customers. Kraken blows (very small margin limits, constant platform errors when submitting orders, and lack of lending market).  Polo is fine, but no USD margin.  Stamp will supposedly have margin soon.  Finex is the most liquid.
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:09:38
It can, and it will.  We will reconvene in a couple of months.  I didn't say it was going there forever, but we are going to retest lower support levels over the next 4 years until the next havening.

I'd rather not say what coin / how many... but it was significant.  With that said, I forgot to mention that I did ask the mod in the trollbox to help speed up the process. They said they would pass it along. Not sure if they actually did or not. For what it's worth, no matter how nervous delayed withdrawals make me, I find that being extremely polite usually gets me preferential treatment.  I don't immediately jump threats.

The BTC ATM works great at the D, but the ultimate irony is that my wife walked into the gift shop right next to it while I was using it and the cashier lady stole her credit card info and tried to buy some $400 boots at a local store 1 week later.  I know this to be true because the whole trip was paid for in Bitcoin and cash, except that one CC transaction which was later investigated and confirmed via camera by mastercard.  I really want to like the D because they were early BTC adopters, but the music is so loud that the craps dealers can't hear you. After getting into a shouting match (and nearly a fist fight) with one of the pit bosses over several hundred dollars in misplaced bets around the table, I decided to hit up the Deja Vu strip club BTC ATM instead, which needless to say, had a better view.

Doesn't seem to have similar whois data when compared to btc-e.nz or btc-e.com.  No btc-e cloudflare.  Private listing.  Registered in 2014.  Last update was today (assuming to point it to the other exchange that I have never heard of).  Doubt it's owned by btc-e. My money is on btc-e.nz if the exchange does ever come back online.

I had the same problem. I will share my experience. I submitted a withdraw, 1 hour later it still had not processed.  I contacted support, they got back to me within the time frame they said they would (said 24 hrs, got back within 2 hrs). They requested that I disable 2FA and reenable it using one of the new methods (google, authy, or SMS).  They no longer allow email for 2FA. That was the hangup. For some reason when I did that it reset my password though, which put another slight delay on my withdrawal. However, after I changed the 2FA, they promptly initiated the withdraw. No additional information or verification was required.  I also added the suggested "trusted address".
I have had an unverified account for about 2 years.  If you've been a customer since before the recent update, try the above and share your experience.  I would be curious to know if it works for you too.

@_date: 2015-10-22 02:34:58
I 100% agree. I just try not to jump to the threats too quickly. These days in the crypto world a couple of hours feels like a long time for withdrawal. But I remember the days of waiting weeks when dealing with more traditional exchanges for my withdraws to go through.  Hell, if I wanted to even make a trade I had to call somebody on the phone. That wasn't that long ago.  :)

From official btc-e twitter today, assuming the fbi doesn't control that now too:
07/31/2017 - 07:47:20 AM 
More detailed information about what happened to the BTC-e service.
On July 25, 11:00 the FBI staff came to the data center where our server equipment was located and seized all equipment, the servers contained databases and purses of our service.
Almost for 6 days we could not get from our hosting provider the sane information, what happened to our servers because of this information we publish only now.
July 28, the domain was confiscated.
To date, part of the service facility was arrested by the FBI
The next update will include information on what options are available to restore the service, and also the procedure for obtaining funds, in the event that the service is not started. In the current situation, if the service is not started before the end of August, then from September 1 we will start the process of refund.
In the next 1-2 weeks, we will evaluate and publish information about how much money fell into the hands of the FBI and what amount of funds is available for return.
For all those who buried us, I will remind you that the service has always worked on trust and we are ready to answer for it.
The funds will be returned to everyone!
Arrest of the Russian Vinnyk Alexandra: 
Officially declare - Alexander was never the head or employee of our service.
Sincerely btc-e
P.S. In the subject write questions as far as possible we will answer them.

Seriously though, the core wallet should have an import wallet function, you'll just need the password (if any) that you encrypted the wallet with. One of the light wallets would probably be able to handle it as well if you didn't want to download the whole blockchain.
