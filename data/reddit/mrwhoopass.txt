Translation: 1 or 2 whales pumped the market when they saw bitcoiners were euphoric. And once the sheep are done buying the whales will dump again. 
Only happened 150 times before but i'm sure this time it's different. 
@_date: 2016-10-22 09:34:19
Don't be ridiculous. People move millions through banks all the time without any issues. 
You don't suddenly have 5 million in your account that gets frozen because you can't explain where it comes from. 
Billions get moved through banks daily. It's what they are made for. 
Yes, you're right, nobody will ask where that money in Bitcoin comes from. Congrats, you found a use case for 0.0000001% of the world population. The rest will move their money through banks because it's easier and safer. 
But don't let that fact stop the little circle jerk you're trying to start. 
@_date: 2016-10-14 23:18:48
No matter the answers in this thread, it Bitcoin would hit 10k tomorrow 99% of this sub would sell their coins instantly. For dirty horrible worthless bankster fiat of course. They would build a prepper bunker, buy a human female and never look back. 
@_date: 2016-10-17 18:07:10
If the price of Bitcoin goes down, how does that fix inflation?
@_date: 2016-10-08 05:57:49
Sorry, i stopped reading after the redditor for 12 days part. The rest will be equally sad.

Haha what? Fiat is gonna collapse? How and when exactly?
@_date: 2016-10-19 19:55:52
Because no person with an iq above 70 would use them. 
@_date: 2016-10-07 11:32:15
And what if Bitcoin drops to say $300, which as we all know is very possible? 
@_date: 2016-10-20 14:35:47
That guy makes it sound as if being right-winged is some kind of sickness. 
@_date: 2016-10-20 13:42:20
I use Bitwala and am very happy with their service. I bet there is a fee but i doubt you can't afford a few euros a month and i think it's very unlikely you'll find a free alternative. 
@_date: 2016-10-07 12:30:46
I use Bitwala all the time. Great company!
@_date: 2016-10-07 22:33:32
Yes, right. Of course. And of course our own Gonzobon in this very sub has access to this information and knows more than all of us. 
@_date: 2016-10-15 15:50:44
And this is gonna happen soon, i take it?
@_date: 2016-10-07 15:49:30
What do you mean with that? How was there less violence?
@_date: 2016-10-07 17:53:56
By FAR the majority of violence happens earlier on in the chain. Before the Silk Road vendor sells it online. It doesn't by magic appear online without 10 steps before that. Selling stuff online doesn't eliminate any steps before that. Cartels aren't selling online by the gram. 
Also a dealer in real life has no interest in harming a buyer. None whatsoever. 
I can't believe i have to explain this all. 
@_date: 2016-10-07 16:14:54
Ok i get that but how was there less violence? You act as if the drugs never exchanged hands offline. Silk Road just added one more level to the whole process from creator to dealer to user. Silk Road didn't magically make the violence associated with drugs dissapear. 
Edit: imagine being able to discuss things here like adults without downvoting everything you disagree with. Wouldn't that be something!
@_date: 2016-10-21 15:16:52
This is getting ridiculous. 
What do you think they get in return? Hot air? Bitcoins? Take a fucking guess.

You just pick a specific period of time depending on the topic. Hilarious.

Ah no evidence. Just downvotes. Surprising.

Yup, sounds about right.

1 or 2 whales bought some coins because they saw how euphoric bitcoiners were. 
You're highly delusional if you think it's anything else. 
In the last 7 years there is not a single piece of evidence that any currency going down anywhere made Bitcoin go up, other than a few bitcoiners buying in hopes to start a rally. 
@_date: 2016-10-14 13:54:47
Ridiculous title and ridiculous article. 


Bullshit. Pure speculation based on absolutely nothing. 
Why does this click bait shit get posted here? What's the point? To circle jerk about made up facts? 
@_date: 2016-10-17 13:38:46
Yeah, he should've Dogecoin instead. Or is that also not allowed? Only Bitcoin, right? ONLY Bitcoin would've saved his ass. 
@_date: 2016-10-22 21:53:47
No. Of course not. 
@_date: 2016-10-20 09:38:12
Wait, what? A ridiculous sensationalist click bait article on top of the Bitcoin sub? That usually never happens here!
@_date: 2016-10-13 18:38:31
Why are you telling me that? Who is trolling?
@_date: 2016-10-19 21:32:34
Nothing points to interest and adoption driving itself "these days". 
@_date: 2016-10-14 23:43:16
Hilarious. 
Anyway, i'll play along with your delusions. 
All fiat on earth "collapsed". What does this mean according to you? That nobody can buy anything anymore?
@_date: 2016-10-07 10:08:33
Their currency isn't collapsing and why the hell would they need Bitcoin? If one Pound bought a loaf of bread yesterday it still does so today. 1 gbp = 1 gbp
And tell me where they are gonna buy their loaf of bread with
bitcoin. 
Also putting all your money in Bitcoin is just ridiculous. Way too dangerous as history has shown. The price could drop 30% overnight. Will you compensate all those people in case that happens or will you just say SFYL?
@_date: 2016-10-20 18:41:28
Funny, when i point this out i'm labelled a troll. 
@_date: 2016-10-15 00:42:19
Fiat will lose its value and bitcoin will be fine. Because reasons.
Of course, what other possibility could there be. Thanks for the lesson. Going all in in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-10-16 09:47:57
Not all bitcoiners are freaks. But you, you really are batshit crazy. You are mentally ill. In a really bad way. 
@_date: 2016-10-06 13:54:18
Ridicalous sensationalist title. Does Bitcoin really need this?
@_date: 2016-10-18 16:48:12
Yeah, because this usually never happens here, right?
@_date: 2016-10-22 15:09:55
Can we stop these posts till we hit 1000 or so please?
@_date: 2016-10-13 22:41:03
You don't. You will get scammed. 
But you're not gonna accept that answer and will do it anyway and then come here to ask for help because you got scammed. 
@_date: 2016-10-12 14:00:04
I was looking for Bitcoin in the article but couldn't find it?
Maybe you can tell us how this is relevant? 
@_date: 2016-10-07 16:22:13

@_date: 2016-10-13 22:21:56

But why isn't Venezuela, Greece and -insert 3rd world country here- moving to Bitcoin? I just don't get it? Why isn't everybody using it by now??? I just don't get it! It's such a better system than the current system?
Why? God, why???
@_date: 2016-10-13 09:12:06
Why don't you ask the OP?
@_date: 2016-10-11 22:29:02
Bitcoiners hate banks because they have and control the money. Bitcoiners want to have and control the money and be just like banks. Just as long as they are the ones profiting from it. 
@_date: 2016-10-11 14:37:13
Look i'm sure that out of the shitloads of currencies you can find a few examples of where it went wrong. 
This doesn't suddenly make fiat more risky than Bitcoin. Use some common sense please. 
Oh look. "I don't agree with him yet i can't prove him wrong so i just downvote the fuck out of his comment"
Yeah, real mature. 
@_date: 2016-10-17 15:15:31
What a dumbasses! They should've used Dogecoin! That way they wouldn't be able to block their bank. I hope they learn from this and use Dogecoin from now on!
Wth? Why am being downvoted? I thought this sub was all about grtting rid of banks and controlling your own money?!

@_date: 2016-10-22 13:34:04
Ok, now please point out some posts where i am trolling. Also i use Bitcoin so why would i bash it? Maybe in your cultish rage you are misunderstanding my posts. Going against the (usually ridiculous) circle jerk does not equal bashing Bitcoin. 
Now show me how i am trolling. I hope i don't have to ask again. Thanks.

That site is horrible. Really bad journalism.

@_date: 2016-10-19 19:03:17
Bitcoin will make things just more complicated and expensive. Plus he will probably lose it, have it stuck in cyberspace or have it stolen before he can use it. 
@_date: 2016-10-21 14:56:33
As with pretty much anything Bitcoin: most likely not. 
@_date: 2016-10-13 16:48:15
So why don't you tell us why you posted this here? How exactly is this relevant to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-10-12 08:58:52
Wait, the free market is somehow manipulation free?
Look, i have no idea what this guy does but i'm sure it's in his best interest. You want something else that is in your best interest. That's how the free market works. So tell me, do bitcoiners want a free market, yes or no?
@_date: 2016-10-11 22:55:23
All i'm saying is that bitcoiners would become the people they hate so much if they could. It's hypocritical as hell. 
We are here pretending we want to save the world and the poor but everyone here just wants to get rich and say "fuck you, got mine". Just like those oh so evil bankers. 
@_date: 2016-10-14 16:38:02
No sorry, after 7 years maybe a few 100 people out of millions in a country using Bitcoin is not worth reporting. Let alone reporting it with words like records in all caps. 
@_date: 2016-10-20 23:54:11


This must be one of the funniest things i've read this month. 
But seriously, how can you type this knowing you, me, the OB devs and anyone else who tried this know this is not the case? Far from.
Crazy. 
@_date: 2016-10-22 09:44:37
I'm not dismissing Bitcoin. I own bitcoins and use them. (Unlike most here who just "hodl")
I just don't participate in these ridiculous and flawed circle jerks. 
And that makes me a troll, right?
@_date: 2016-10-22 09:24:20
Just 20 more years and it works just like banks! 
@_date: 2016-10-10 14:46:31
Yes he can get away with it. Just like 99% of the bitcoin scammers. You want no regulation, this is the result. So stop crying. 
@_date: 2016-10-21 08:20:55
What is it with this sub and the constant flow of made up sensationalist bullshit titles?
Is Bitcoin doing THAT bad?
@_date: 2016-10-17 11:11:32
After 7 years still nobody has a clue what Bitcoin's killer app is. 
And again downvoted for pointing out reality. God, so pathetic. 
@_date: 2016-10-17 11:28:32
Did you downvote me??
Anyway, we were talking about being caught with gold. I simply gave an example how not to get caught with money in your hands. Your answer has nothing to do with this. 
But seriously, wth did you or anybody else downvote me? 
@_date: 2016-10-14 01:01:06
Do you realize there is no guarantee whatsoever that Bitcoin will stay at this price and not go down 50%?
You sound like you have no financial experience at all. You're going to do really stupid things. 
@_date: 2016-10-13 21:57:53
Yes we get it. This off-topic fear mongering gets posted every 30 minutes. 
@_date: 2016-10-20 13:08:05
Except that it isn't. 
@_date: 2016-10-07 00:42:36
Uh 6% is nothing when it comes to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-10-16 23:00:37
And people like you are the reason Bitcoin has a bad name. 
There is no reason for 99.9% of the people out there to use Bitcoin. And you trying to force those people to use something they don't want will just make you look like a scammer. 
Seriously, why the hell would that guy selling a bike want your internet tokens?
@_date: 2016-10-07 11:36:00
Look, i play it high risk too. That's why i hold a lot of coins. But at the same time i'm not all over the place suggesting people should do the same because for the majority of people this will end up not good.


This type of investing isn't about weeks. 
@_date: 2016-10-13 17:00:34
Because people have been posting this fear mongering here and other bitcoins forums for years now. 
For years now fiat is about to crash and the stock markets about to burn. Yet nothing ever happens and there is no evidence whatsoever that this would affect Bitcoin. 
Also the fact that this place opens up the champagne when other people suffer makes me sick. 
@_date: 2016-10-07 11:30:55
Yeah imagine that. Countries who can control their own shit again. We don't want that to happen, do we? 
@_date: 2016-10-20 08:40:33
Paypal is instant so what did you do to cause this?
These sensationalist posts are just so pathetic. It makes you look so desperate. You're literally saying "i know Paypal is better but i'm gonna pull some bs to show it's not".

@_date: 2016-10-18 08:59:17
Just like the 200 things before this, this will not take Bitcoin to the moon. So helping him won't make you rich. 
@_date: 2016-10-14 15:32:03
Wow, that must be 100 people a week at least using Local Bitcoin! It's like the whole country is moving to Bitcoin!
@_date: 2016-10-17 10:05:22
Or with the money in his bank account. 
@_date: 2016-10-20 18:17:19
Because we all know OB is doing great, with tons of users and sales, right?
But i get it, if you point out certain uncomfortable facts here downvotes and being labelled a troll is the usual answer.

Hahaha holy shit! YES, you are! 
@_date: 2016-10-10 14:43:41

What does this have to do with this sub?
@_date: 2016-10-17 17:04:52


It's down 50% since 3 years ago. And it might go down to 200 by next week. 
No, the GBP being low is not one of the main reasons to buy Bitcoin. Holding Bitcoin is way, WAY more dangerous than holding GBP. 
@_date: 2016-10-19 21:12:04
And Bitcoin will solve this!
Right, guys?
@_date: 2016-10-15 00:53:02
Let me guess. Everyone should put his money in Bitcoin and that will magically solve their problems? Am i close?
@_date: 2016-10-07 12:22:04

This is good for Bitcoin i assume? Right, guys?
@_date: 2016-10-10 14:47:51
So this is project  that will make Bitcoin go mainstream? I'm sure this time it will happen! Right guys?
@_date: 2016-10-12 06:17:57
Yes correct. A lot of autism as well. I'm not joking. 
@_date: 2016-10-16 16:45:18
Ok, but where is your source?
Downvoted for asking a source. Because when something is good for Bitcoin you are not allowed to question it. Even if it's complete nonsense. 
@_date: 2016-10-20 18:51:32
There are vendors doing 100's of sales?? Can you point out a few?
@_date: 2016-10-12 08:39:24

@_date: 2016-10-12 15:23:41
Really? Can you give me a few examples?
@_date: 2016-10-12 15:44:10
Oh right. Now i'm a troll. Hilarious. 
Re-read your comment and think about who is trolling here. 
@_date: 2016-10-09 21:45:37
You're being sarcastic, right?
@_date: 2016-10-17 22:32:28


@_date: 2016-10-23 08:03:28
Yeah bitcoiners absolutely totally hate censorship! They hate it!!!
But if you say something here that is not good for Bitcoin they will censor you by downvoting you to hell. 
 But they reaaaaaaaally hate censorship!
@_date: 2016-10-07 11:19:29
Did you miss the part where i explained that putting your money in Bitcoin is very dangerous for the average person?
Also it's way too difficult to use for average Joe. Why do you ignore this? Suggesting people move their money into Bitcoin at this point simply is ridiculous! It's useless and pointless to 99.9% of the world out there. No amount of downvotes will change that. 
What you instead could suggest is that those who are interested put a few % of their money in Bitcoin and see how it works and what the price does. And see if it makes their lives any better. Doesn't that make more sense to you than "omgggg the Pound is collapsing!!!!! Move all your monies to Bitcoin before it's all gone!!1!"
@_date: 2016-10-22 13:44:08
So, like, fake volume spikes?
@_date: 2016-10-17 11:51:56
I couldn't find Bitcoin in the article? 
@_date: 2016-10-22 16:02:07
No. this is a feature yet it's a huge reason for the public to not use Bitcoin.

A bitcoiner on a bitcoin forum bought some bitcoins. 
That surely convinced me!
@_date: 2016-10-12 15:48:55
Yeah and now some examples with proof. Not some hot air and buzz words. 
@_date: 2016-10-21 15:52:45
Still waiting on your answer.

How the hell is bitcoin a safe haven? It's one of the most unsafe investments i can think of. If an exchange gets hacked the price drops 200 dollar in 3 hours. Which WILL happen again. 
Does this sound like a safe haven to you? To me it sounds like one of the riskiest investments out there. If a newspaper claims Satoshi is found the price drops 200 dollars. And so on. 
No, people aren't turning to Bitcoin because it's a safe haven. They might for other reasons but not for this reason. 
Edit: when you downvote me without even trying to prove me wrong it just tells me i'm right. Such extremely sad behaviour.

99% of the people here are hoping to get rich off Bitcoin without working. As soon as possible. That's it. That's all there is to it. Nothing more, nothing less. 
If Bitcoin would by magic be worth 10k tomorrow this sub would be empty the day after because everyone would've sold their coins for dirty fiat. 
I know this, you know this, everyone knows this. And there is nothing wrong with it. Just stop pretending it's anything else than that. Stop with the all the bullshit about banks, freedom, saving the poor. Nobody gives a single fuck about that anymore as soon as the price hits 10k. 
@_date: 2016-10-18 12:27:12
Why? Why would he?
@_date: 2016-10-21 19:02:12
What's next? Bitcoin will cure aids?
@_date: 2016-10-20 09:02:20
How can you people post this is one thread and wonder why the world isn't moving to Bitcoin in the next?
@_date: 2016-10-15 10:53:49
It's all about the technology, right guys? About saving the poor and making the world a better place?
Oh wait, no, it's all about making as much (fiat) money as possible without working. 
@_date: 2016-10-10 20:17:51
Wait....you put 1000's of dollars on an exchange that just got hacked and can't even pay back previous clients?
You are just trolling right? Tell me this is a joke. 
@_date: 2016-10-21 16:45:32
Thank you for some common sense in this thread. 
@_date: 2016-10-21 15:06:46
Fiat being abandoned? Wtf are you talking about?
When you read these articles do you just make stuff up in your head so it will be good for Bitcoin in your fantasy world? Seriously, what happens in your brain when you read this?
@_date: 2016-10-15 09:01:44
As long as you ignore that the Bitcoin price can drop 50% overnight, right. And that it currently is worth half of what it was 3 years ago. 
Ah just small details. Just ignore them. 
Hilarious how i am downvoted. 
@_date: 2016-10-16 18:42:16
Yeah sorry for helping him. Won't happen again. 
@_date: 2016-10-11 14:03:48
Sorry but unless you're holding Zimbabwean dollars that's a ridiculous statement. 
@_date: 2016-10-22 15:20:55
10.000's of transactions not going through or taking hours; paypal unaffected. 
Yes, as childish as the OP. 
Edit: actually less childish as this scenario is very common compared to the few hours a year Paypal goes down. 
@_date: 2016-10-13 23:54:22
You really couldn't figure out you should send your coins to your own wallet first?
@_date: 2016-10-13 22:12:59
No answer. Really surprising. Didn't see that coming. 
@_date: 2016-10-13 18:45:08
All the signs of what? What will happen exactly and what is your lifeboat? What makes it a lifeboat?
@_date: 2016-10-22 13:22:21
So the above post (fact you don't like) made you go through my account? Fuck, that's scary and extremely cultish. 
Anyway, can you point out a few posts where i'm trolling and explain why? Tip: me posting facts ypu don't like is not trolling. 
@_date: 2016-10-20 15:40:46
Bitcoin user not affected!
@_date: 2016-10-07 16:30:04
How can you dispute that? Bitcoin has dropped 50% or more several times it in the past. That makes it very possible. 
Just one exchange going down, just one reason for panic and were back at 200 while you blink. It's more likely to happen in the future than not. 
@_date: 2016-10-21 12:04:40


Nowhere. The free market will sort itself out. 
We hate the government, remember?
@_date: 2016-10-21 15:42:44


Yet i'm being ridiculed, downvoted and called a troll for asking a normal, sane question in a ridiculous circle jerk thread. 
This place is completely insane. I wonder how many people reported me for god knows what in this thread. 
People go through my history and downvote other posts just because i'm asking a circle jerk breaking question. Do you have any idea how crazy that is?
@_date: 2016-10-18 14:21:45
Be ready for: you shouldn't use the default wallet, you idiot. 
Here's a quick lesson. Whatever goes wrong (and a lot will go wrong), it's always your own stupid fault. 
@_date: 2016-10-07 22:37:56
just like it would hit 10k in 2013 2014 2015 and 2016. And you were an idiot if you didn't see this coming. 
The thing is not once did any of these people come back here to post how they were wrong. And of course neither will you. 
@_date: 2016-10-21 20:12:21


My sides!
@_date: 2016-10-12 15:32:28
A safe haven that can crash 50% overnight because an exchange got hacked. 
Please, for once go out of this sub and talk to some people in the finance world. Explain to them how Bitcoin is a safe haven and report back here please. I can't wait. 
@_date: 2016-10-12 15:25:14
Of course. As long as other people lose their money and houses this sub is euphoric. Because one day the 2 coin hodler will have the power of the evil banker. Right guyz?
@_date: 2016-10-18 16:24:35
Indeed. 
@_date: 2016-10-13 13:46:14
What do you expect people here to do exactly? Just contact them. This is a bitcoin sub. Not their support forum. 
@_date: 2016-10-21 19:45:28


Good thing in the Bitcoin world there is no such thing as fraud, (identity) theft and malware!
That on top of 3 tps! 
No way i'd use anything else!!
@_date: 2016-10-21 17:37:24
I have no idea wtf you are talking about. I said none of those things. You probably responded to the wrong person. Idiot.
