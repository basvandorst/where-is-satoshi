Oh wow, that didn't last long. I'm sad again.

Yes, when you sell BTC on Coinbase, you receive the amount of money that you sold it for. It's an agreed upon price between you and Coinbase, where they will in turn sell the coins, and you will receive the money as soon as the processing goes through.
I'm not a Coinbase rep, but this seems to be the most reasonable outcome, and I've been using them as my primary source for coin purchases as I don't feel like spending the money on a wire transfer, and I'm not day trading.

Coinbase is now back online!

I'm honestly not certain. The ones that are most popular in general are btc-e, bitstamp, and mtgox.

Can't argue with that, but how long do you think it'll last? I imagine it would be gone within an hour at the rate people are making purchases.

They're back once again! Let's not buy them out all at once this time! Haha

They just don't have the support or functionality that an actual exchange has, such as trading with other people. You're purchasing from an intermediary that has purchased the coins themselves. I wish it would change, but Coinbase doesn't offer buy or sell orders, only recurring payments.
On an exchange, on the other hand, you're purchasing from other people and not the site itself. The fee that the site charges is their fee for using them to conduct the trade.
Edit: This doesn't mean you CAN'T day trade with Coinbase, but they don't offer all the features, nor the versatility, that an actual exchange offers. You would need to more closely monitor the price changes, and you wouldn't be as protected if you wanted to save yourself from a crash.
I prefer Coinbase, though, because they're very easy to use and you don't have to do any wire transfers; they'll withdraw from your account each time you make a purchase instead. They each have their advantages.

It's back again!

I think the amount invested should vary from person to person. I hopped on board pretty big when it was still in the mid $200s, just below the $266 ATH. Although I still have resources available should I need them, and I can sell BTC should I direly need it, I'm more so using it as a bank account rather than an investment. I do have some purchases that occurred in the 300 and 400 areas, but unless the market absolutely tanks, I feel pretty secure.
My biggest reason for feeling so secure is my gut. Even when I see drops (such as what's happening now), I tell myself that they're just part of the ride on the way to higher and higher gains.
