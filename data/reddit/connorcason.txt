Good point. Since BTC is at least recognized (as in people have heard of it) by most 1st world countries now, once a couple big names in news get wind of successful LN transactions in hoping it'll spur adoption. Sometimes even those big names are so misinformed though. Oh well.

I scooped up what I could afford at 13.5k two days ago because I had the same thought process. Mempool is slowly starting to clear as well, so that should help jumpstart things again.

Best meme I've seen in some time

The post has already been removed, and the original post that you linked was as well, so I don't know what you need an opinion on. Try reposting a more cogent version of your question.

It is 364B USD

Based on this article, it looks like they will reinstate it in a little while. Once LN activates and the vast majority of people switch to Segwit wallets, it will cure at least the tx fee problem, which appears to be their main concern. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:22:03
I thought GDAX &gt; coinbase was free, regardless of who owns what account. Is that incorrect? I'm pretty sure, since coinbase BTC is essentially just credited (no access to PK's). It never goes through the actual BTC blockchain, so I was under the impression that fees would be non-existent or extremely minimal.
Edit: Money did go through, but not sure the exact amount she received.

If you want people to read your posts, you should use correct grammar. I can hardly tell what you're trying to say here. Not trying to flame, just a suggestion.
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:48:20
Not a problem man, just try to tidy up posts in the future and you're much more likely to get responses.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:14:11
HODL. Trading BTC might as well be casting a die. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:08:13
We (the community) knows this is a problem. That's the whole reason we are implementing Segwit addresses as well as the lightning network. Have patience as this should be resolved within the year.
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:36:30
I would also like answers to these questions. I have read multiple times about how 80% of the power is still signaling 2x, and it's only a matter of days until the fork. Is this true? Does this mean that 80% of the BTC networks hashing power is moving to the forked B2X network?
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:21:20
I transferred over 5.3k for under 5 dollars in preparation for the fork, that seems pretty fair to me.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:22:32
GDAX charts almost always look like this. There is a clear wall at the 10k mark, so a correction around that area is likely. Who knows though.
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:51:40
GDAX is instant. That convenience is what you pay the majority of fees for. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:56:16
I actually think this is a great idea if we get someone to put together a quality meme.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:06:30
Why is everyone so concerned about a correction? 2X just got called off, and Bitcoin is more popular than gold on Google. Things looks stable to me. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:49:20
You have to realize that going around trying to convince random people that Bitcoin is the future is the same as, or worse, than Mormons droning on at an atheists doorstep. As much as I love promoting BTC, it's important to draw the line between a shill few and far between, and going full Bitcoin missionary.
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:59:54
 Also took the short end this time, I feel m8.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:52:37
Not a conspiracy. This is reality. Money follows opportunity. Whether 'they' (whales) come out publicly for or against crypto, they see it as an opportunity and dive in head first with this strategy. With trading tools as advanced as today's, it's not a surprise whales are picking up then shorting cryptos.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:56:24
I think the solution has more to do with upgrading the BTC network to the point where this type of 'attack' doesn't phase it.
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:46:31
Couldn't agree more, but the real problem is he directly targets noobies by claiming Btrash is the "real" Bitcoin. He acts like his project was somehow personally approved by the white paper itself. What a joke.
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:31:34
GDAX is an exchange operated by Coinbase, but is geared toward more experienced users. Coinbase's user friendly UI/debit/credit support is intended for people dipping their toes in the crypto water.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:57:31
His logic for why Bcash should hold the name "Bitcoin" is possibly the most perplexing part of this interview. His team forked off the original chain. The original chain will always be there, and will always be BTC, even if people mass adopted an alt and left BTC altogether. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:24:01
Slush, only real pool dedicated to BTC. When I get the hardware, that's where I'm going. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:57:15
Yeah. So your CPU will most likely mine "CryptoNiteXMR", and your GPU will probably mine "Equihash", both being automatically turned into BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:18:27
It's been an interesting day
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:02:05
Electrum and Exodus are typical fan favorites as well. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:54:16
Already happening, whether it's publicized or not is a different question. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:40:29
I suppose bad news is better than no news.
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:01:34
Do we have a way to gauge what chain is going to be most profitable before the fork? B2X is an enemy in my mind (and I think many others) but is there a significant chance that it will prevail over BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:53:52
I recommend Electrum as a software wallet, and none other than the Ledger Nano S for safekeeping.
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:19:19
Didn't want to name an alt directly to avoid auto mod, but yes, this ^^^
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:01:11
Well, as a clarification, I'm not sure if GDAX requires a deposit to the exchange before buying, or whether it is linked to the bank account associated with your Coinbase account. If it is the former, you will have to wait for your bank to confirm the USD transfer to GDAX before buying BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:39:09
I use GDAX. Not sure how they compare to other exchanges in terms of fees, but I consider them reasonable. Sold ~6k for under 15 the other day. (Don't worry I bought back in)
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:26:23
That's not true, they have the consequence of increasing the value of each coin. If people think there are 21 million available, and it turns out there's only 8 or 10 million, that's only half of the supply. That surely would affect BTC price. If you disagree, why? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:14:44
In my opinion, the most important part of this operation would be security. Is one of the 3 profiting members familiar with blockchain security? Or cyber security in general? As a potential customer, I think using a reputable ATM would be my  concern.  If only 3 people are running this operation, I'm not sure how the average customer could see legitimacy. No expert here, just my two cents. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:14:15
I don't think intelligence plays a factor in this conversation at all. I'm not claiming high intelligence either. I completely agree that DOXing yourself in any manner is ill advised and I encourage you to continue to 'spread the good word' as it will educate future Bitcoiners. That being said, calling people stupid is not the best way to achieve this goal. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:48:11
GUI miners for PC's such as Minergate and Nicehash automatically mine the most profitable alts. Nicehash will automatically convert these alts into BTC, Minergate will not. I suggest you try these out for an intro to mining.
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:49:11
Dummy? I'm fully aware of the information I divulge. I'm a software engineer who is confident in the way I protect my assets. Just because I gave an example of fees on a specific trade means nothing. I understand privacy is important, but name calling in this manner is elementary. Don't be so quick to judge. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:28:26
Unfortunately almost every person on this sub is in your shoes, including myself. If you want more BTC, you have 2 options: trade, or mine.  The first, giving you a statistical likelihood of 50% to reducing your BTC holdings, and the latter being impractical in most situations. My best advice is to try to use a sustainable DCA system, and a small reserve for any flash crash you're willing to bet on. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:10:35
Your first problem is that it's a logarithmic fit...

Coming to this sub solely to post an I'll-informed opinion: classic
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:21:04
Yes. Blockchain.info provides real time info on the BTC network that will help you to decide for yourself whether it's time to move your coin.

This is a question for r/DarkNetMarkets, or a similar sub.

Don't get too worked up just yet, GDAX is reporting slow transactions at the moment. I was about to do the exact same thing until I read the GDAX status page. If it doesn't come through by the morning, do some investigating.
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:53:47
I don't have first hand experience with this situation, so I'm not sure. I imagine the GDAX website would address this questions.

This is the most obvious ponzi I've seen in a while... and I've seen some bad ones

I believe simple supply and demand begs to differ. What's your basis for that claim?
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:18:15
I've been wondering this as well. With all of their talk about mining with "extra" energy (can't be true in reality), many environmentally conscious people may flock to it. Thoughts?
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:57:29
So we will just change our PoW to some quantum SHA?
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:37:05
My thoughts exactly. I can't imagine what the people who have invested heavily into this guy are thinking right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:09:34
If "I'm a millionaire" is the first line of defense in an argument, I can't help but think this guy is a menace. He claims he wants Bitcoin to be decentralized and available to the poor, third world citizens of the world, and that's why he is part of the Bcash project; then in the same argument, he uses his personal financial success as an indicator of legitimacy. The irony is too real.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:57:21
Agreed. Unfortunately cloud mining is a scam (whether paid or not), because they will always pull some of your 'earning' hashrate to pump their own wallets and then pay you 80% of the coin your hashpower has earned.
Edit: I support everyone owning a home miner, but it's expensive and impractical at the moment.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:46:42
Sometime between 2X cancel and now. I don't know if attack is the right word exactly, but if you look at major exchanges like GDAX, it's clear that there is intentional clogging of the network via tx spamming tiny amounts.
@_date: 2018-03-24 13:57:07
Someone please correct me if I'm wrong: If you're mining a crypto and have not exchanged that coin/token for USD then you don't have to report it as income. If/when you sell your cryptos for USD, you have to pay capital gains tax since BTC and other cryptos are currently in the category of a commodity under US law. I know some states (New York and possibly others) are taxing miners based on electricity use, so you may want to look into that as well.
@_date: 2018-03-24 14:27:58
Thanks for the correction. Do you know if you can write off any mining equipment as an investment? 
@_date: 2018-03-13 04:48:54
The chances that this 'miner' actually siphons your CPU, or worse, your GPU resources and then pays you a fraction of the BTC your hashing earned is quite high. But I haven't tried first hand, so it's just an educated guess based upon existing systems similar to this. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 14:22:27
Well if the price of BTC more than doubles in the next 1000 days than money will be made correct?
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:17:42
This is approximately the strategy I use, and it works well *on average*. Don't panic sell and don't flash buy, the first of which claiming perhaps the  rule of BTC. Like many have said, even if you buy now, at what is essentially an ATH, and it dips back down in the coming days, you'll look back in months or years and be thankful for such cheap coins. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:26:38
At this rate, the transfer fees I paid to move my BTC into another electrum wallet are going to outgrow my BTG redemption value... embarrasing for the dev team and their 100,000 of pre-mined shitcoin 
@_date: 2017-10-17 13:53:57
I'm not saying that it is not a pyramid/ponzi scheme, but right now auroramine.com is turning me a profit. They have almost reached their max hash power and I have no idea what is going to happen then, but so far so good. I'd be wary of investing now, for the hashing power reason, but they have upgraded their power a few times in the 22 days that the server has been up so it's hard to tell. You do get 100 GH/s totally free though, so I'd start with that if I were in your shoes and feel it out from there.
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:11:57
Have the app on a throwaway android. Downloaded it less than 12 hours ago and haven't seen an update since, no BTG on the coin list.
@_date: 2017-10-24 16:16:22
Wondering the same about Electrum. Can't even find a legit wallet that supports BTG at all.
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:27:52
Bitcoin is a system that prioritizes privacy over ease of use. As applications of the technology grow, so will consumer facing features. Eventually, the idea is that spending Bitcoin will be as simple as swiping a credit card. That being said, the Bitcoin network will never inherently ‘insure’ transactions, or lost coin. It isn’t, and is unlikely to ever be the way the network operates. The ‘safety net’ functionalities you are referring to are essentially in direct contradiction with the current protocol, which was implemented after reaching a democratic consensus.
