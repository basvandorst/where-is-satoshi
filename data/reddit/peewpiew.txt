And buy the dips!

I don't fully understand why al his/her comments have an aggressive attitude. We all wanna see bitcoin doing well.

Its a wallet, it stores bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Technically not actually storing them but holding your private key, read up online or watch some YT videos explaining this.
You can receive and send as many times as you want (take note that you pay transaction fees though). I have the ledger nano s and very happy with it. Set up to minutes and easy to use.
To answer your other question: I'm a big supporter of having a hardware wallet instead of having your coins on an exchange (Unless you want to actively trade.) especially since you mention buying more.

@_date: 2017-11-30 13:51:02

And gdax below 10k again boys, second sale
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:49:08
Is gdax having difficulties or is it just me?

What will likely happen to bitcoin price once futures trading actually starts?

Bought at 9600 at previous dip. Gonna see where this one goes and probably buy some
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:07:15
Trust me, almost all of us are trying to buy this dip. Probably the reason the systems are freaking out. 95K+ unconfirmed transactions atm
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:24:38
GDAX back up
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:10:47
Wallet apps are acting strange here as well. Ledger still working without problems.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:55:46
Back at 10K
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:59:02
Dropping again, 9.7K
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:02:33
No really sure what you are trying to say. You understand how mining bitcoin works?
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:06:53
prepair to buy the dip and HODL
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:16:44

@_date: 2017-11-29 20:02:24

@_date: 2017-11-30 11:06:18
