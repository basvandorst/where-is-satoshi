you didn’t capitalize your sentences... no reason to [sic] your grammar dogs on me. 
But yeah. I’m fucking off to Mexico for two weeks. I’m not taking my cell phone. The future.... is kind of lame. Trying to reclaim that old-school glory of going somewhere where you don’t know anybody, or anything.
Phones just gonna get in the way of that.... I don’t want to Yelp my next meal. Trying to get away....

get real, dawg... that's my comment to this entire subreddit. GET REAL!
you're not real yet. GET REAL!

Nah. I’m thinking bigger. 
I shall IGNORE the market, and NOT get rich. I’m banking in this entire Roman Empire to fall.  
Bigger they are... harder they fall. They killed Kennedy. They fucked up most of the Middle East.
My life is not measured in “Munayz” my life is meaured in experiences.
I’d rather be poor in Maui then rich in Chicago...

Lemme Pay my Comcast bill with two pizzas tonight. Can’t be done.
Will take weeks , to move it around the exchange and then it into actual MONEY.
And the only reason it’s turned into money thanks to ASSHOLES LIKE YOU!  PBS kids folks.
If you and “your kind” finally wake up from your dream - that night the bitcoin will fall and ruin much MUCH more lives then it ever had a potential to create.
Ya’ll creating SkyNet maniggas

I like bitcoin.... I love the IDEA! Just like I love the IDEA of god. But did I find Jesus? Fuck no! Been mining him for years ⛏ 
What you’re saying is what IM SAYING:
Crack cocaine.
@_date: 2018-01-25 09:23:05
alright. lets not argue. im already convinced on "math" and "decentrilization"
Only thing im having a hard time to wrap my brain around... is "fake moeny".  So, in the 1970s the federal reserve dropped the gold standard. Dollars are officially fake. So I can't argue and say bitcoin is any better or worse (its better... cause you can track them dollars through blockchain)
canada said they gonna fund their govbernment with.
my problem is.... i just think... that its... not gonna work... and i have no LOGICAL reason to argue with you. So if you want to do "logic" lets just agree you win and I lose.
i'm coming at ya with a different angle!! People love using the term "common sense".  But do they realize a common sense in ....  tanzania? will be different then poland? or maybe common sense in the insect kingdom will play a slightly different way then in the animal/human kingdom? HMM???
You wanna go negotiate with a praying mantis, go ahead. I'll wait right over here. With zero bitcoins to my name.

no, im divorcing her cause im sick of her BULLSHIT.  (sound familiar........)
@_date: 2018-01-25 09:01:52
alright let me attempt to explain to you where i'm coming from. You'll have to excuse basically everything you know about debate in order to receive my message. I hope you give it your best effort.
k. here goes:
1. Crypto is a joke because it's Satoshi's weird experiemnt, and then all you idiots went "viral" with it. So obviously if his worthless experiment is worth a bunch of billion dollars now... obVEEEEOUUSLY... you've already killed bitcoin by assigning it any value. Crypto was supposed to be communism. Crypto was gonna change the world. Instead you're letting the corporate asshoels take it over... and so crypto is now capitalism. 
And ... mmkayy... we all know like.... mkay... Capitalism is a ponzi scheme mmkay? Captialism is like mmhmm.. its like a Fake Dream you have but then when you wake up it isn't True mmkay? It's like... mmkay? Do you know anybody over 60 years old? Mmkay?   They fucking hate what "Dey Kuntry" became now.   So many kids died in vietnam SO MANY FUCKING KIDS dawg. Dem niggas got MURKED. Okay moving on....
2. The math is beautiful. I love the way Satoshi (Sandeshi? Sandunski? Whatever his dumb ass japanese name is)  the way he worked it out. It's basically ART. It's GORGEOUS to look at. It's not something i would spend real money on though.... well kind of just like ART!
3. it's not a currency. i'm not even going to mention my point cause you already know it. You're not paying your electricity bill with bitcoin, therefore it is NOT a currency.
4. Unsustainable... look at the damn numbers. $12... then $260... then $20,000 OOPS... i meant $10,000
who EVER is running these fucking exchanges... i worry for their wellbeing. I don't think they can continue laughing like this, 24/7 without dying. I mean everyone has to eat but how can you eat when you're just laughing at all the suckers you've sold "fake" dollars for "real" dollars to?
5. Coin mining is bad for environment because it wastes real resources to create this FAAAAYYYYKKKKKKEE AND GAAYYYYYY currency

I’m not good at “debate”.  Never took that class. There seems to be some kind of “rules” and stuff... and also things like FALLACIES OF REASONING. They just don’t apply to real world.
I mean... I’d love to join your chat and waste your time, but are you sure you want somebody trying to make “arguments” when they don’t respect the rules of arguing?
@_date: 2018-01-25 09:06:10
im sorry man, i had to do it. I'm truly sorry that i had to grab it with my bare hands, and squeeze this crypto until it's last breath was utteredd.....

Do you know who our president is? He gets to dictate a lot of shit.
I’m not political. I’m 31 years old and I’m about to give up, because every time I try to find happiness,
I just get violently reminded that “everyone is different” and has their own opinions and blah blah.
That would be great if you weren’t all just pretending, while being genuine assholes.
Everyone! Myself included.

The fact that I am responding to your comment leads me to believe that you did in fact leave a comment, that much is obvious.

Upvote.... we’re gullible but come on. This is why I’m depressed. People believe in totally unlikely bullshit.

This wallet has a negative balance. I didn't think that was possible. Can someone please explain?
