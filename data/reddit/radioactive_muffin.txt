I'd assume someone with millions doesn't have all their assets in bitcoin because well...duh.

Go to an exchange, sell it to someone else for their 19k...

Depends how much of their stuff went down. This caused some pretty wonky shit to happen over on r/gdax when this last happened for people with stop orders.
Not sure if all got resolved, but most at least seemed to say that it did end up going through (but they only learned of it about 1-3 days after, and until then they thought their shit was totally gone for good.)

You think we'll touch that line at some point in 2020? Still seems....quite optimistic

Well...in Feb 17 we hit $1k. Today, we still aren't solidly above $10k. That's over 2 years, closer to 3 to grow a single decade. That doesn't really match well for $100k...and the next half decade or more to get to the line after that. 
Along with that, you don't want it to get there too soon since instabilities (dipping and jumping $40k at a time, or more) at such levels makes the platform look like even more of a joke, and scarier to the general population.

You're thinking we'll be at &gt;$170k before 2020?
Just trying to wrap my mind around this for a second...here I was thinking an optimistic goal is 9-10k.

However, doing it smartly without giving away your bank account passwords...it takes about a week to get an allowance of more than $250/week. $250 is something, but it isn't really a whole ton.
