I set my fee to 0 of 99% of my transactions and have never had any problems.  Network transaction volume does not yet warrant them except in the cases where the protocol requires it, which is rare (most clients will tell you when required).

It's not illegal in the U.S., in fact there are many places where gambling is legal, such as Nevada and on many waterways.  Online gambling however is illegal, and it is due to gambling industry lobbyists owning our congresspeople.  Online gambling regulations were put in place largely to protect the existing gambling industry.

Just a note, for the large majority of transactions, you can still send them for free.  I only pay a transaction fee on transactions that I absolutely need to be included in the next block, or that the protocol demands for transaction size reasons.  Otherwise, my offered fee is always 0.  Very rarely are my transactions not included in the next block.  The network volume at this time (and since network inception) really doesn't warrant paying transaction fees to prioritize your transactions, and miners are still very healthily rewarded by the block reward.

First, verify that it still holds its value by entering the "firstbits" printed on the coin (or visible through the hologram window) here:
This will show how much Bitcoin value has been sent to the private key contained within the coin.
Next, you can either pay it forward and give/spend it with someone else, you can keep it, or you can pull out the private key from underneath the hologram and import it into a digital wallet like Armory or an exchange like Mt. Gox.

I'm still waiting on two $10k withdrawals that I initiated nearly a month ago.  They were via Dwolla though ($10k is the max for Dwolla transfer), so part of that delay was that they somehow un-verified my account that had been verified for nearly a year and I had to jump through some support hoops to get them to double-check my paperwork and re-verify my account back to "trusted".  That was about a week ago, and I'm still waiting on my withdrawals to process.  So, yes, yes they are.

The answer to this would seem fairly obvious to me...  The hash rate provided by ASICs and FPGAs will be far greater than what GPUs can provide at far less power.  As they join the network, the total network hash rate will increase, which will drive the difficulty upward.  My guess would be it will increase by quite a bit as these devices come online.

The questions you raise have nothing to do with Bitcoin.  Would you give access to the wallet to your entire company any more than you would give access to the bank account?  As you indicate, the CFO or financial department should have access to such.  The multiple risks you identify are easily addressed by a disaster recovery plan and hopefully choosing a trustworthy CFO.  None of these risks are unique to Bitcoin and can easily be associated with access to a USD bank account.  Your final risks can all be alleviated by using basic encryption, access and keys to which again can be included in a disaster recovery plan in case something happens to the individuals who regularly have access.

I trade on Mt. Gox for multiple reasons.  First, liquidity; they're by far the largest exchange in transaction volume.  My trades are nearly always guaranteed to execute.  Second, I can move USD around, usually within 24 hours, using the combination of Mt. Gox, Dwolla, and my bank.  Third, you can't arbitrage trade multiple exchanges without including Mt. Gox; Gox is frequently on the lower end of an arbitrage trade where the other smaller exchanges tend to stay more in-line with each other at higher exchange rates.  Finally, I do enough transaction volume to afford me an average of 0.3% fees; the more you trade, the lower your fees get.
I personally don't care how much Mt. Gox makes a day for providing a service that people want and use.  The market will speak and vote with where they trade, and obviously Mt. Gox is doing something right in many people's opinions or people wouldn't trade there.

If you want to contribute to and protect the network, you don't want to run a miner, you want to run a full node.

There are no transactions that "require" a fee.  There are only miners who may or may not include your transaction in their block if they find the next solution, and currently most miners do not discriminate against transactions with no fee attached.  There simply aren't enough transactions on the network to warrant excluding transactions with no fee.  On the occasional block that we're seeing now where it's hitting the size limit, miners will likely prioritize higher fees into the block and lower fees out, but chances are any that are excluded will be included in the next block.  The network is just too small to bother worrying about fees currently.  Only include a fee if you absolutely have to have your transaction in the very next block.

The question was regarding using Bitcoin as a payment method.  This does not imply needing to convert to Bitcoin from another currency, or back to another currency.  The question also did not contextualize the situation to be for business use, it was more general than that.  When viewed solely as a payment method to get value from one party to another, it is far superior.
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:39:01
While I agree with you, I'd like to point out that the only thing limiting the divisibility of a Bitcoin to 1,000,000 parts is software. The protocol imposes no such limit. What happens in 50 years when 1 "bit" is worth $1000? The software will have been updated to support more decimal places long before that, making your "bit" no longer the smallest unit. I propose making a "bit" 1/1000 of a bitcoin, as we already have a friendly name for 1/1000000, the Satoshi. We'll create new names as needed when the software is updated to support additional decimal places.
@_date: 2013-03-26 07:16:59

Note, just like "coin", "Bitcoin" when used as a general word for value (as opposed to physical coins, ex. "You have the desire, but do you have the coin?") is both singular and plural.  Pluralizing Bitcoin with an 's' ("Bitcoins") is redundant.  It's also a proper noun, thus should always be capitalized (:
Further, unless you're going to put at least 2 BTC into the address you're leaving, pluralizing Bitcoin wouldn't make sense anyway as you're only leaving them a fraction of a Bitcoin...

The problem is you tried to use a web service (third party) to do an in-person transaction.  Using a web wallet when trying to pay for something in person is similar to having your bank do an ACH transaction for you while you're standing at the register.  Not only do you have to instruct this third party to perform the transaction for you, you have to hope that they are currently capable of doing so, as you unfortunately found out in this case they were not.  You should also have a stand-alone wallet on your smart phone that you use for in-person transactions, then move funds into it from your web wallet like you would withdraw cash at an ATM from your bank account into the wallet that you keep in your pocket.  Using a stand-alone smart-phone wallet, all you need is Internet access, no third-party dependencies required.

It will take a long time for Bitcoin to reach a ubiquitous state where this is possible.

The only way to pay your bills currently is to convince your landlord to accept Bitcoin, or use an intermediary like a gift or Bitcoin-fueled credit card.
I don't buy the vendor risk argument, as most Bitcoin-based payment processors convert instantly to fiat if you desire that.  There's very little risk of losing value due to volatility using such services, like BitPay.

Currently most miner software is programmed to include all pending transactions when it finds a block, so until there is no more block reward and miners begin choosing which transactions they will include based on the fees included, you can safely bet that your transaction, regardless of the fee amount you include, will be included in the next block found.  I send nearly all of my transactions with 0 fees and they are always included in the next block found.
I have seen however one stingy miner that includes zero transactions in its blocks, every time.  It's probably custom mining software, however if that miner finds the next block, no one's transactions will be included, so you're still being included just as fast as everyone else (:

"Best" is relative to what your priorities and desired feature-set are.  There are plenty of good exchanges that trade in USD.  You can rank them by volume, you can rank them by ease of deposit and withdrawal, you can even rank them by how many times they've been hacked in some cases (:
@_date: 2013-04-27 14:07:55
Lots of people do that, however since it's nearly always a one-way proposition, they then have to move USD from Mt. Gox back over to the smaller exchanges, which generally takes time.  During that time, they can't trade.

Many Bitcoin clients will recommend a fee based on parameters of the transaction (and some will force you to include one), but the user is always welcome to not include a fee at all with their transactions.  It is entirely up to the discretion of the miner who finds the next block as to which transactions they will include in that block.

Gold and silver are useful in making jewelry and electronics primarily.  If the apocalypse scenario you describe happens, I doubt people will care much about jewelry, and who needs electronics sans electricity?

I never pay a fee (set to 0.00 BTC) on all transactions and my transactions are generally included in the next block, or the one after that.  There are simply not enough transactions on the network yet for miners to bother prioritizing based on fees, and miners are generally content to be rewarded by the block reward for now.  If you're including fees and don't absolutely have to have your transaction in the very next block, you're throwing money away.

The goal of a DDoS is to disable the target.  If the target disables itself in response to the DDoS, the goal is accomplished.  If the target does this immediately when the attack starts, it's accomplished with way less effort than it would require to accomplish it if the target didn't self-disable.
An exchange that voluntarily disables itself at the drop of a packet would quickly become uncompetitive considering that Bitcoin is a 24/7/365 digital currency and payment processing network.  Users will go elsewhere and not use that exchange.  No sane business is going to self-disable when their competition doesn't.

Bitcoins are infinitely divisible.  The current software will divide Bitcoins to 8 decimal places, or a "Satoshi" (0.00000001 BTC).  When deflation has caused a single Satoshi to be too expensive in fiat currency for the layman to purchase, the software will be updated to allow divisibility to further decimal places.
@_date: 2013-03-13 05:16:06
Correct.  If I remember correctly, the Auditor was attempting to identify accounts with weak passwords by attempting to crack the passwords or something, thus the Auditor had access to the accounts database.  It's been a while though, I could be remembering that incorrectly.  Still a mistake on Mt. Gox's part for trusting the particular Auditor, but not a weakness or vulnerability in their system or software.

You should always use real wallet applications for in-person transactions.  As many others have mentioned here, some online wallets like Coinbase can delay for long periods of time.  Further, shared web wallets sometimes don't provide distinction between you and someone else's wallet, using a pool of addresses for everyone's wallets, which is why automated gambling apps discourage use of them when wagering with their sites; the return payment sent to the address that the original payment came from may not make it back to your individual wallet.
On a side note, and I personally have horrible luck with this, even using real wallet software can sometimes take a while to do an in-person transaction.  I frequently have the misfortune of doing in-person transactions right before the network decides not to find a new block for an hour, or an hour and a half.  Sitting with someone in a bank lobby or coffee shop for up to an hour while waiting for even a single confirmation can be quite annoying if you have things to do, so always plan to potentially be there for a couple hours if required.

I disagree.  It is being adopted as a medium of exchange, just not quickly enough for your comfort level.  I purchase things in Bitcoin all the time, but I don't do it just to do it, I have to find something worth purchasing first.  I also pay people for services in Bitcoin, mostly software developers, and I know many of them spend them as well.  The economy is growing, just give it some time...
@_date: 2013-04-11 07:06:03
You will not if you solo-mine, the frequency at which you would find a block would be tens if not hundreds of years at this point.  You will need to join a mining pool to see any kind of regular return.
