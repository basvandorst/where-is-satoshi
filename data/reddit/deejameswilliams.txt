Bitcoins is a perfect investment nowadays. Many investors are joining the trend and this is why the value is rising. I am looking to retire soon and focus on my bitcoin investments and trades. But for now, I am still buying bitcoins as many as I can thru Paxful.

I don't think they will because lots of merchants who are accepting bitcoins will surely hate it and the economy will be affected. I am still continuing my Bitcoin trades in Paxful while learning thru their Paxful School to be more equipped into the Bitcoin world.

I have paxful as my main wallet and another 1 where I buy GCs for gifts and other things I want. I suggest to spread out your bitcoins to atleast 2 to 3 different wallets.

These companies have an agreement where they can trace purchases of each Bitcoin wallet owner for sure. Because they wouldn't know if they don't. I'm thankful that my Paxful wallet is more secure than coinbase.
