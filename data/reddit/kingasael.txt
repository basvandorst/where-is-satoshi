OP, your best bet, to fully leverage use of your skill sets &amp; experience, is to read [11 Best Reads For Learning About Decentralized Applications]( and then join us over at r/ethereum. Tons of [great projects]( underway.

Remind me how much shares of Berkshire go for?

It's usually FedEx or UPS paying USPS a certain discounted fee to finish the "last mile" portion of the delivery and cut their costs. USPS will take any revenue they can get at this point, they're running at multiple billions lost per year.  They have some type of logistics systems setup that tells them who has the best coverage in each area between routes and fulfillment nodes. The exact nature of a UPS completing the last mile portion, I'm not sure of.

The hope is that it's more of a catalyst and not just a tracker.

The bigger issue is 21 not crowd funding a single cent of something that obviously has massive upside potential. Seems counterintuitive, especially for people who allegedly understand the new decentralized economy and are working to build it. But, we're supposed to be building together. The more vested, the better is my view. When will this centralized trend of fat cat VCs getting all the ground floor opportunities end? Strategic alliances/investment, I have more sympathy for but somethings gotta give.

Figured someone was gonna say something about the stealth aspect. It's completely understandable. My main point is there should be some type of investment opportunity available to non institutional investors before going public which usually never happens. This is exactly why Regulation A has been amended with new stipulations (Hope I didn't confuse you with the term crowd funding, this is what I was referring to). 
"The rule amendments create a two-tiered framework for Regulation A offerings. Issuers in Tier 1 may offer and sell up to $20 million of securities over the course of a 12-month period, and issuers in Tier 2 may offer and sell up to $50 million of securities over a 12-month period." Also does NOT require the same level of reporting and disclosure as traditional securities. I'm bullish on the future of Regulation A x Crypto-Equities, but companies so far have not taken advantage :/

USPS has a backend API available at a steep cost and often partners with large volume shippers to offer discounts on high volumes, eg. Amazon, Ebay, Gilt, etc.

Does he really use a macbook? Doesn't seem very cypherpunk or am I mistaken?

lol'd. Private keys are obviously on multiple gold DVD-R distributed geographically.

He's saying satoshi may have not kept the key for fear of being compromised and thus didn't make a backup.
