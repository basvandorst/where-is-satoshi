This is funny but I can't stress enough how real this gets whenever people see you had invested in BTC a long time ago
Someone I knew in high school reached out to me saying they quit college to "focus on Bitcoin full-time"
And that they are going to just try and save all their money and just buy Bitcoin.

...are you not trading Bitcoin in exchange  for said product or service?

Because you're clearly insecure and think everyone is trying to throw things in your face ��
How many of you people don't even own 1BTC yet come here everyday as "investors"?

OP and most people here don't even own 1BTC yet feel like they're so knowledgeable...
I miss when there were less cryptos than you can count on one hand
At least then only the truly knowledgeable people could wrap their head around the technology and it's implications rather than getting a hard-on for the price

Weird algorithm for Reddit, but I guess it worked. Got us commenting and probably spending more time looking at subs Hahaha

According to the logic you're not a HODLER at all

You make a valid point that many people forget.  These companies have their entire business model as being the middlemen. By being able to digitize the process and eliminate the middle man then they have no business.

I actually posted it there for the sake of it Haha

He is very much aware that he's greedy and only trying to turn a profit for himself. 
He's not trying to save anything except his money.

I can tell it's going to flop

THIS. Is why I come to this sub. Haha

I'm American and so considering this is my native currency, it actually surprised me I didn't read it "dollar thirty-seven" Hahaha
I had gained such a tendency to skip over the first character or zero
