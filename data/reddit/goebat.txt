Sure you can!
I reckon some of the high end machines at shapeways and the like are capable of a high enough resolution to print functional lego blocks.  I'm really not sure about consumer level machines though, but I'd guess some of the better ones could make a go of it.
@_date: 2014-01-07 08:49:17
It would.  Even at the crazy prices they charge for lego, 3D printing still has a long way to go to be price competitive with mass produced goods.
@_date: 2014-01-07 09:03:02
I don't doubt it.  You could never get the same finish and accuracy on a 3D printer, even on the high end machines.  I don't mean to come across as an authority on the subject - I have limited experience in 3D printing.  The guys over in would be able to give a definitive answer I'm sure.

I think they're just casting a pretty wide net.  You must've done something that impressed them to some extent.  Were you approached on LinkedIn as well?

Cool designs.  I would make the B bigger, so it overlaps the recycle symbol a little, but that's just me.  That license is PERFECT!

The best I've found are and [coinality]( There's also [Bitgigs]( and [Bittask]( I can't vouch for any of them, but they might be worth checking out.

Over half of the bitcoins that will ever exist have already been mined.  In 20 years time, mining returns will be a fraction of what they are now, so if China wanted to control the bitcoin economy, they'd have to make their move now.  Given recent news of positive press coverage by the state sanctioned media, they might already be on this.
Edit: Changed "government controlled" to "state sanctioned"

According to [internetworldstats](
 internet penetration in Ghana is currently around 14%. I'm guessing that's probably the major barrier to adoption.

Sweet as! Thanks for the tip - my first one! I felt bad because I hadn't tipped everyone I felt deserved it earlier, so I'll rectify that now.
I like your suggestions, and I hope this thread got enough exposure to get people thinking about more ways to get people trading openly.

Shapeways are a fantastic company and I've had a shop with them for a few years now. I for one would be over the moon if they started accepting bitcoins, and I've made a few attempts to open a discussion with them, but never had a reply.
Full disclosure: My shop features bitcoin rings which would probably sell pretty well if they started accepting bitcoins!

I've been wanting to do something along these lines myself for some time now.  I think the real potential here is to harness the power of the distributed model - something along the lines of what [makexyz]( ) are doing, but powered with bitcoin.

When I first posted the ring they were really quite excited about it, posting it on their blog and tweeting about it, but they just haven't been receptive to actually accepting BTC.  I've made a few attempts to engage them but they've been largely ignored.  Maybe the time has finally come!
@_date: 2013-12-16 16:42:01
You could also try 
@_date: 2013-11-26 11:55:34
Tell Shapeways how you want to pay for your nerdbling!
Full disclosure: I designed that ring and it might actually sell if Shapeways started accepting BTC.
Edit: Please RT if you're so inclined.
Edit 2: This is going really well - there is a barrage of positive comments being left on their blog. Keep 'em coming!

Doesn't seem like a bad deal to me (assuming they can deliver).  Compared to, say, buying an AsicMiner Block Erupter for 1BTC, which gives you 330MH/s, here for the same outlay, you get 3 times the hashing power. Plus you can still trade on the shares.

Haha - Nice one.  You do make a very valid point.  I suppose it depends on how safe you feel in your environment.  I see people nonchalantly waving their expensive smartphones about in public all the time.  Are some of these people targeted?  Sure!  If you feel the design would paint a target on your back, don't display it.  Would be funny if your design wins!
@_date: 2013-05-21 01:33:27
Point taken.  I think it will still be interesting to see what the community comes up with - it doesn't have to be 100% universal, but the more people that can get a hint at the meaning, the better.  Maybe different countries/cultures take a cue from it and design their own logo?  Thanks for the input.
@_date: 2013-05-21 22:57:31
This is absolutely aimed at individuals. There are already [stickers]( for merchants that accept bitcoin, this is for people looking to trade bitcoin for cash and vice-versa with anyone they meet on the street, on the subway, at the coffee shop.

Wearing/displaying one of the standard logos certainly might initiate conversations between enthusiasts, but doesn't necessarily indicate that someone is actively looking to do public trades.  You're right though, there's nothing to stop the standard logo from serving this purpose.  I just think that at the moment, wearing a generic bitcoin cap/T-shirt/whatever is less likely to do that than a well designed logo that specifically advertises a willingness to trade.

Same here. I made a few short posts in a bitcoin group on LinkedIn and was asked to join their advisory board.  I hadn't heard of them before so I did some googling which turned up some interesting [controversy]( surrounding the group's President - Eric Klein. I haven't accepted.

Hi, I am the creator of the bitcoin ring referred to in this blog.  I've just posted a request to open a discussion with shapeways to consider adopting bitcoin as a method of payment. I think it would be awesome for both shapeways and for bitcoin (not to mention I might actually sell a few bitcoin rings!)
Edit: it seems my post has been rejected, which doesn't bode well.  I've also [tweeted]( to shapeways asking if they are considering accepting bitcoin, but with no reply :(
@_date: 2013-05-21 05:24:18
Submit an image and see what people think.  I kind of like the idea of incorporating a hand symbol that could be used without even having to display the logo.  I can just picture people walking around making some kind of "B" symbol with their hands and the look of utter confusion when this brings random people together into little groups pointing their smartphones at one another!

That's a shame.  I really think 3D Printing could be a fantastic vehicle for accelerating the bitcoin economy.  I'm currently talking to someone at MakeXYZ trying to convince them to accept BTC - we'll see how that goes.  Maybe if more people from this sub chime in they'll give it some more thought.

I think he's being serious: 
Although for something like a kleenex box you'd get a much better result if you just modelled it in a 3D modelling package like Blender or sketchup :P
@_date: 2013-05-27 10:12:00
It was the bitcoin logo with "I carry cash, please rob me" crudely scrawled across it. He did raise a fair point.

Cool idea, but I'm hoping for something with more universal recognition.  ASL is really only recognisable to members of the American deaf community.
