Jesus the contempt some people have for those unaware of bitcoin is insane. You gave her a piece of paper that she didn’t know what to do with, it’s no wonder she lost it, she didn’t understand it’s importance.

You don’t really seem to like your relatives. Why even give them something in the first place?

I'm sure the currency of the world's largest economy with a nominal GDP of 22.9 trillion USD in the safest part of the world is long overdue for a mysterious and sudden collapse

i mean, that's not how it works though is it? They're still using the energy, what do you think surplus energy looks like? It's not like places with cheaper electricity are dumping all their energy in huge fucking flywheels or wasting it just for fun.
What would be interesting is if btc is more energy EFFICIENT than regular modes of payment. Cash in particular is probably horrendous for the environment (think of the armoured trucks driving weekly to every supermarket), and for banking you'd have to accumulate not just the server cost of banks but also the gas every single employee takes to work everyday, etc etc.

Probably why you used it in the first place

I get that it would be wasted but you can’t chalk it up as a net win for bitcoin specifically since you could power all kinds of stuff with that extra fuel. Even when hooking it up to a computer you could do other calculations. 
The energy saving innovation here is using the extra gas not using it for bitcoin

Lol the great thing about bitcoin is that you can’t tell me to do shit. This tech isn’t for you lmao

But this is still using energy, you could do the same and not use it for bitcoin. There isn’t any actual material gain from doing that.

And we as bitcoin investors know that value graphs are one thing before all others and that is they're always linear if you zoom out far enough

your views are completely counter to anything remotely scientific. you are blinded by ideology

It would make sense for the US to create something like this to enable the CIA for example to make illegal payments to terrorist groups abroad. 
Iran Contra would have never become public

So claiming is fair game then? All land was either taken by force or inherited from someone who took it by force. History was a bloody battle for wealth and at some point rich people said "stop no more, from now on we'll exchange goods instead of killing rich people for it"
Capitalism is shit unless everyone starts equal. And education same opportunities same emotional support from parents but maybe wealth would congregate even then over long enough periods of time as random statistical noise gets amplified. 
Your ideology's dumb mate

Unless you have some people lobbying for your behalf I doubt the irs is as lenient with you as it is with multi billion dollar businesses
