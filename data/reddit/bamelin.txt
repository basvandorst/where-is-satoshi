Exactly how I felt
@_date: 2018-01-14 09:40:55
I feel the big money lies somewhere in the top 200 coins ... finding a winner that will go X 100.
That isn’t bitcoin anymore

This is why I invested with the  index fund (speaking to your point on rebalancing and diversifying).

I don't trust anyone to hold my private keys except me.   Private wallet imho always best way to go.
And don't make any transactions shortly after the fork until replay protection is figured out

I'm 0.01 from hitting 0.1.  It keeps being harder and harder to achieve.  Part of the reason my mania to get in NOW keeps getting stronger.
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:20:15
I'm holding long term.  I do not play the buy low sell high game.  My goal is to slowly increase BTC holdings no matter the price.
This is because I feel long term BTC will go to 25k.  Maybe even much much higher.

What constitutes "a lot" of money is different to different people.
My take is - once you feel the value of your crypto is "a lot" to you, then go buy a hardware wallet.
Other advice I've heard is to look at hardware wallet like a bank and mobile/hot wallets like a normal (money) wallet -- do you keep thousands of dollars in your wallet?  Probaly not.  But you might carry a couple hundred on you ...
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:47:44
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:08:39
It will be interesting to see if there is a buying frenzy right before the fork.  Could this push us past 10k?  Or dare I say it, 12k?
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:38:14
I'm not in that situation or remotely close to it.  But if I was next step would be most trusted best friend.
Basically seed backup goes to somebody who won't fuck you over.  If you have no family or friends and a shitload of bitcoin that might mean a law firm.

@_date: 2017-11-02 18:31:56
I think mobile wallets are fine for a limited (say under 1500 dollars value) number of coins.  
Once you have more than that it's hardware wallet time.
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:46:31
I'm prepared to see my small stake halved.  But I played in the 2013 rocket to 1k so I know what this coin can do.

Absolutely price will drop.  Then whoever wins that fork will rise to the skies.  I'll be staying in holding both coins as a hedge until the smoke clears.  Whether it's BTC or 2X, I win.  Unless it's bitcoin cash in which case I lose lol
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:29:03
I downloaded the best mobile wallet I could find and then bought BTC using a BTM machine.  The BTM fee sucked (10%), but that way I didn't need to mess with an online exchange.  Plus it was super fast and I caught the rocket to 6800.

You'd be surprised how any people think they have to buy a whole bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:36:47
I have almost exactly the same amount.  0.158786645343 or something like that lol.
Regardless it's valuable and could potentially be VERY valuable one day.  I'll continue adding to it but I doubt I'll get it much higher before bitcoin rises so high it becomes difficult to amass even fractions of btc.
Assuming BTC survives the upcoming fork I have a feeling the next 12 - 24 months will be the last chance to get btc for really cheap (under 10k).
Re: you not believing it could go to 100,000, in 2013 we were stunned when it jumped from 100 to 1000.

I'm bearish on Ethereum.  With that said, I think it has room to grow, but dollar for dollar LTC is underpriced imho.  
I did almost invest in crypto20 -   .   While ICO's make me nervous the idea behind a crypto index fund was really appealing.  But I just don't trust my private keys under anyone's care but my own.

A few nuggets of advice:
There are PC wallets, mobile wallets, exchange wallets and hardware wallets.
Exchange is worst ... they hold your keys if they go belly up, get hacked, you lose your bitcoin.
Mobile is a "hot wallet".  Any wallet with an active internet connection is considered hot.  Security is medium but u do hold you own keys.  
Cold wallets are paper or hardware (specialized USB keys like trezor or nano S).  Offline wallets, most secure.
I use a mobile wallet, my holdings are minimal.  But minimal is defined by the user.   
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:22:17
Yw.  Honestly it's a great site.  Watch the video, I went from noob to semi competent with that sites help.  The wallet video alone was a godsend
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:08:29
When I saw bitcoin had reached 5700 I was like "I'm too late" on this forum.
Somebody said "You aren't too late this is just the beginning".
So I put I $550 dollars.  Fast forward a month later almost $900 dollars a coin growth.
Anyone still thinking about it, it's not too late.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:32:14
Holy shit
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:02:37
That would put me at 3 mill cad.
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:39:02
The point is what's hot shit now can be replaced.  Hopefully that's not bitcoins fate in invested too
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:18:08
Is this why BTC is shooting to the moon?  I bought some more BTC yesterday at $6600 it's already up $500!
So far dollar cost averaging I've got in at various price points between 5700 and 7000
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:56:45
I'll be holding both as a hedge, just in case.   One of the only nice things about this fork.
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:38:41

@_date: 2017-11-02 04:17:11
I'm in at 5700.  It's up almost 1000 so feels like a good choice.  What do you guys think the dip will be?
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:52:44
At 1.1 it's time for a hardware wallet bro.
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:48:29
If your coins are on an exchange that have said they will support both coins, after the fork you should have both BTC and 2X coins 1:1 in your exchange account.
If you prefer to be more secure keep your BTC in cold storage or in a mobile wallet and figure it all out after the fork ... keep in mind nobody really knows what value 2X will shave off BTC, also keep in mind that right after the fork replay is a big danger unless your exchange has enacted replay protection.  2X has no natural replay protection meaning BTC spent could end up on the wrong chain or something like that.
Some people will be in a rush to dump their "free" 2X before prices crash (although that's a big if too).   I'd hold both coins until the dust settles as a hedge.
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:21:05
I think I'll be going ledger nano S once my holdings surpass 2k.  For now using a mobile wallet.  I would NEVER hold on an exchange after seeing what happened to mt gox

I did check them out but felt the fees were too high compared to crypto20.  Which makes sense given that crypto20 is following the index fund passive "follow the market" strategy versus Iconomi's active management model.
With that said I think both areas will continue to see growth.

In regards to number 2, should I make a paper wallet or swallow the cost for a Trezor?  My goal is to buy and hold, no day trading.  
I was thinking to wait until I have 1000 in my hot wallet to put out for a hardware wallet, then sweep my hot wallet to the Trezor

@_date: 2017-10-21 07:18:54
There was lineups at BTM's in Toronto.  That's unheard of.
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:29:39
Or look for a BTM (BTC atm) in your city.  Fees are a bit high on BTM's but it's an easy way to get in the game.
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:26:03
That's how I felt in 2013 during the rocket to $1000 (I watched but wasn't involved in BTC ... has a tiny bit in LTC which I pulled).  Thinking back I regret not doing a buy here and there and hold strategy.
I feel there's a huge amount of growth ahead (possibly thousands more) so I'll be adding slowly to my holdings long term from here on out.
I still think right now is early early game with crypto still in its birth stages before it hits mainstream
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:15:03
I can only afford a couple hundred a month right now ... but will def be buying and holding.

Maybe the days of buying at 10 cents and becoming a millionaire a few years later are over ... but there's still very much a chance at making 10X returns or more over the next few years.  
@_date: 2017-10-30 05:22:18
What about top cryos like ETH, LTC etc ... I hear many saying the day to make 100X has passed with BTC but still possible with Alt coins
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:59:19
Look at it this way ... pre 2013 on the rocket to $1000 was the basement level.  We are now at ground floor of a VERY large tower imho.  I bought back in today close to $200 USD.  I will continue to buy and hold monthly, although I may make larger purchases short term.  
Get in now and hold.  6k is nothing even if it only doubles.  And I feel it could do far far more than double.
It's a far better bet than say a lottery ticket.
@_date: 2017-10-21 12:26:20
RemindMe! 1 year "100k impossible!"
@_date: 2017-10-21 06:12:07
I'm amateur but imho crypto still has a long way to go.  If FEELS like everyone rode the train and are millionaires but reality is that's the 0.01 percent.  
Now WE are the 1% (maybe less).
If this truly goes mainstream in the next 20 years even a small BTC holding could be worth a lot of money.  6k per coin is a lot.  I felt the same way at 1k per coin.
Imagine 100k per coin.  Or 250k per coin.   I'm talking way long term 10 years down the line.
Buy and HOLD.  We are still in the very early days.   Prices that seem SO expensive now will be the good old days, just like how I look at BTC in 2013.
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:56:28

@_date: 2017-10-30 03:56:20
It's not too late 
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:13:26
I was following BTC avidly in 2013, even bought some LTC.  I regret not buying more over years and holding.
I think there is still thousands of dollars worth of growth so I'm going to follow the strategy I should have enacted in 2013 when BTC jumped to 1000 ... I'll be buying a 100 or so monthly and HOLDING long term over the next 10 years.

For now I'll settle for a nice nest egg for the future ... a nest egg that would never be possible if I don't gamble with this unique, once in a lifetime opportunity.
If I had more money I'd pour it all in.  But even with my limited funds I feel this is a unique chance to make some serious coin.  And if it doesn't work out lose very little in the long scheme of things.

People flee to hard assets during downturns ... BTC is a hard asset like gold imho
@_date: 2017-10-15 06:51:00
Of course .. didn't lose money but wish I had held on and invested more.  I thought the whole thing was a bubble.
@_date: 2017-10-31 04:00:57
I'm on kraken but only because cavirtex was bought out by them.  Also heard good things about quadrifacx based in Vancouver.

In 2013 when BTC first exploded to 500 USD or so I dabbled in LTC ... considered BTC but thought it was "too expensive", that I "missed the boat".

In you opinion what's the window to get in on the ground floor (I feel 6k right now is still the ground floor.  1k was the basement lol)
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:30:18
Nope.  I got back in
@_date: 2017-10-19 04:31:42
I should add this is the single greatest thing from getting folks to buy in.
Years ago I dabbled, kept my money on an exchange but when mount GOX happened I panicked.   I had my stuff held on a Canadian exchange but that scared me badly.  
If I buy in again I want to be able to pull funds onto a USB key.  Anyone do that?

Tldr: don't be a daytrader.  Buy BTC and HOLD
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:09:42
At 60k a coin it grows to 5k USD.
At 600,00k a coin it grows to 50k US D.
At 1.6 mill a coin 500k USD
While I think 1.6 mill is a pipe dream, I also thought 6k us was a pipe dream.  
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:41:23
It will be in the back of my head but I can be patient.  I dabbled in the market in 2013 when things blew up and thought omg 1000 no way.
I know better now and based on my research there is ALOT more long term growth ahead.  I feel this is still only the beginning.
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:34:41
Also I don't understand the "hard fork".
Will this mean I hold another currency?

Etrade commercial 
@_date: 2017-10-21 07:13:38
From an outsiders perspective.  I dabbled in 2013 with LTC (thought I was "too late" for BTC lol) but sold out.  Ignored all crypto until 2017.  This year the news in MSM reminded me of 2013.  So I bought in again this time in BTC.  But looking at prices from 2013 compared to now ... this is a new market.  Even 6k I feel will be early adopter prices compared to the future.
And I think I'm still an early adopter compared to normies.  Perhaps more risk adverse compared to the brave souls that went all in pre 2013 ... 
But it's not too late.  We all still have a great chance of making ALOT of money.
@_date: 2017-10-21 07:56:22
My point is that you can gamble on lots of things.  This appears to have a much better chance at "winning" especially this early in the early adopter phase.

So you think diversifying is a bad idea?
@_date: 2017-10-22 02:54:59
Lol not at all.  I'm just dabbling with 400usd btc.  I'd be happy even if it doubles.  100k would be insane

Mycelium is a mobile wallet... you hold your own keys if you use that.
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:46:18
I plan on doing at least 200 a month.  
Not sure about daily but I'm hoping 10 years from now I'll be happy :)
@_date: 2017-10-21 06:13:49
Just put in a bit.  It's a better bet than a lottery ticket.  I've switched my 20 a week from lottario to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-31 05:58:52
I wouldn't.  Set a reasonable amount every pay and put that in.  Also consider diversifying in other major alt coins to hedge your risk. 
Keep in mind this is a huge risk still with the volatility.  I'm getting family involved but we all are doing small amounts at a time, money we can afford to lose.  The reality is this could go 100X or to zero.
Think Myspace versus facebook.  Another coin could unthrone the king although I do believe in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:09:58
If you buy now you get coins in the new alt-coin (when the fork occurs) in addition to your BTC purchase.  So I suspect there will be a big pump shortly before the block forks as everyone buys in to get their "free" coins.
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:03:11
Agree. Epic story of VICTORYYYYY

I'm sticking with BTC and that's it but I'm planning a hold strategy.
Crypto is so early in the game and the volatility is crazy ... but I believe in first arrival advantage which BTC has.  Not to say a few Alt coins won't do well but BTC by name alone will pull the normie mainstreamers in.  
So on that alone I'll hold BTC long term.  At this stage in the game I believe long term it will either create a massive payment for early HOLD adopters or worst case a nice Caribbean cruise if the entire crypto market craters out.   That is to say, at this point anyone planning on holding for 5 - 10 years, I doubt very much can lose.
Even if the market mushrooms to thousands then craters "back to 10k" ... at this point we've already won just putting money in.
At least that's what I'm hoping. :)
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:35:52
I'm not an expert.  Personally I think it will continue to shoot high as everyone tries to get in before the fork.
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:40:34
When it jumped to 1000 it happened FAST that's when a lot jumped in.  But many of us thought it was a crazy bubble :(
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:22:48
I agree with that, it feels like holding gold with a SHITLOAD more volatility but also a lot of room to grow being an early market and us early adopters.
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:51:13
What if gov made it illegal or tries to regulate ...
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:06:27
I agree I bought back in.  I won't lose out again on what's a once in a lifetime chance at gains.
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:01:34
Yup the recovery seed is crucial.  I have one in my safe, the duplicate in my brothers safe along with instructions of what to do were I to die.
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:24:38
It's exactly what it feels like.  Typically I throw 20 a week into a provincial lottery.  That shit went straight into the BTM this week.  Better odds I figure.
Same feels too except instead of checking my numbers once a week I'm checking hourly lol.
It's all good though.  Ideally I want to up my stake to $1000 (possibly adding here and there) then I'll forget about it for 10 years.   If the last 10 years growth is any indication of the future I'll be happy I did.
@_date: 2017-10-30 07:46:04
If that were to happen I'd be a happy man :)
