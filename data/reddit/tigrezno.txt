I reported the post, hope it gets removed quickly.

This was a great help, thanks!

Github link: 
Usage is very simple:
    $ gdax BTC-USD
    11431.58
I usually check the pair price on my phone, but when I'm on the desktop I've yet to find a tool to check them.
So I coded a small Bash script for the command line that I can pipe into my XFCE bar as shown in the screenshot.
It can be adapted to any desktop environment very easily.
For XFCE, just install the **Generic Monitor** plugin and configure it to run the script with the currency pair you like.
I hope someone will find it useful too.

Technical analysis is a joke

I created an account but I can only see BTC/JPY pair. How do I change to BTC/EUR?

How do you get a native segwit address?
@_date: 2018-09-06 08:56:28
This happens because bitcoin is still a "small" market. It needs more adoption to remain stable.
@_date: 2018-09-06 08:48:38
You know it's not the same going $1000 down in a few hours than growing $1000 in a few weeks, right???
@_date: 2018-09-01 08:06:46
wild west I suppose then

This is the clear example that it will take like 20 years to adopt this technology.

Hello, what app did you use? and him?
How was the process?

@_date: 2018-08-26 18:49:46
That's why I posted it, because of HN. Thanks
@_date: 2018-05-11 17:51:49
+1 This has nothing to do with bitcoin. Any type money will do for getting killed. That's it.
@_date: 2018-08-31 20:40:35
Right now, if you get scammed by an online store you can ask Paypal or your bank to undo that operation, right?
How is bitcoin dealing with that issue? (from the perspective of a customer that looks for safe shopping)

Lots of negative comments there...
[edit] can you stop the downvotes? thanks.

Noob question guys. If bitcoin is decentralized, how can you know the value of a bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:33:13
isn't that exclusive for each exchange? I mean, a bitcoin price on each one?
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:45:27
interesting, thanks
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:12:53


People do the same thing with fiat. In general, people suck at money  handling.

Any development to hide our tracks? I really hate being tracked, it's ok that everything is public though.
Also, I don't like mixers as a solution, as it involves 3rd parties.
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:11:58
I wonder what would be the price of Bitcoin if only the "normal" holders were left.
$300??? If so, then we have no power at all and Bitcoin is totally centralized.
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:59:03
Am I the only one buying BTC these days? I think this is a great opportunity after all.
@_date: 2018-03-29 10:07:09
If it soars, why is bitcoin is going down?
@_date: 2018-03-30 10:47:18


Bottom is $0 AFAIK
@_date: 2018-02-25 10:04:49
I don't think that many russians know about bitcoins or crypto in first place.
Who's gonna vote him for these declarations? 50 russian nerds?
I don't see this like a pre-election bullshit.
@_date: 2018-03-31 19:57:34
well played, sir.

Legit question: is the storage needed growing to infinite?
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:11:46
You never invest everything in a single time. I make small purchases every few days/weeks to get better prices.
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:04:22
I'm ready to buy the dip
@_date: 2018-03-24 18:40:46
How can you avoid censorship if your transactions are public and traceable?
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:10:08
Yeah, I just made a spreadsheet in 5 minutes with all my purchases. By just updating the BTC-USD value I get my current earnings/losses.
@_date: 2018-02-12 22:45:55
I think that's a big problem for bitcoin, they can dissappear.
If I die without giving away my keys, my btc are lost forever.
There should be a way for that to not happen, or in a few hundreds of years, the bitcoin will just cease to exist.
@_date: 2018-11-30 20:28:47
I bought 0.15 today :)
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:23:42
Fuck, I need it to visit 5k to buy some more :(

Hello mr stranger. I bought bitcoins because I want to be rich not in a few months, but in 20 years.
I believe BTC will be a success for the society and I want to have a good bunch of them when it happens.
I see myself as "kickstarting" the currency. That's all.
@_date: 2018-03-30 11:01:59
It's a good opportunity to buy more btc
@_date: 2018-02-25 11:17:52
youth = no money, drunk
no money = no bitcoin
It isn't that difficult to understand. If so, this is for the rich russians to expend their money on cryptos.

Please stop using Reddit Video. It's really sucks.
Can't download video on mobile or share it with friends in whatsapp.

Speak for yourself. I'm fairly sure that 99% of youth don't know about bitcoin.

mmm I've never left the page to see videos on gfycat/imgur/youtube.
they are all embedded.

bitcoin.org shows 0.16.2 for me (linux)
@_date: 2018-07-27 18:57:39
This has nothing to do with bitcoin, why is it allowed on Mods are hypocrites as fuck.
@_date: 2018-07-28 08:34:19
It's not only this one, past weeks this has been the norm.

AFAIK this is unsafe, you can be tracked because they are using a public address
@_date: 2018-07-29 19:44:00
I can do that for $10. Get a piece of steel, paint with black fire-proof paint and use my dremel to engrave the keys.
Now, if you don't own a dremel, it might be worth to get the cheapest pack.

So I always hear that Bitcoin isn't related to WallStreet, but what I see is 100% price correlation, right?
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:04:40
So I took "advantage" of these prices and bought another bitcoin. I think the wait has been worth it.
@_date: 2018-12-07 09:56:23
I think all those "hodlers" are russian bots right now.
@_date: 2018-12-07 09:55:08
Is everyone selling? Or are just a few players who control the market?
If it's the latter, then bitcoin is a joke of a currency and I'm starting to lose my faith in it.
This is really bad for adoption, who wants to lose half their money in a week?
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:22:37
Yeah, that's right, I'm not poor but not in a great situation either. Middle class in my country, that means really poor in the USA xD
@_date: 2018-12-28 08:43:58
There will never be 100% security. You have to work with that.
