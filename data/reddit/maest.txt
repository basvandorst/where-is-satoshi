I think you'd benefit more from making a well formed, civilised rebuttal, rather than calling people names from behind a keyboard.

Why is the price on GDAX 5% higher than that on Bitstamp?
GDAX: USD 14830
Bitstamp: USD 14080
Why is it not getting arbed away?

So no options at all, then?

So you're doing alpha-capture where you blind the providers to the source of the data.
I hate to argue semantics, but it's basically the same thing.
Look, I get that this is a publicity thing, but content like this sometimes gets called out.

False. 
Are you involved with the Numerai fund? I find it worrying that someone who works for an allegedly sophisticated hedge fund is not aware of this significant part of the financial markets.

So your top signal provider, who you brag can predict 26% monthly price movements, only receives a meager $13k?
What do you pay less effective submitters?

This is good for bitcoin.

TIL bitcoin used to be really cheap guys

You're right, reddit financial advice is better than ZH financial advice.

What a fantastic way to reduce conversation to an "us vs them" argument.
You're also being inflammatory, which further hurts discussion.
@_date: 2011-06-08 08:36:56
Yeah,you're right, it's gone up. At the time of posting, however, the price had been stable for a couple of days.

Good point. What if, say, one of the miners has considerable computational power and mines a large chunk of the bitcoins? I know there's a top 100 rich people in BTC, but how is that list compiled? Is it freely available becaue of the distributed nature of the network? I know transaction histories have to be known by everyone.
@_date: 2016-05-28 16:50:18
Then I don't get the joke.
@_date: 2015-10-18 10:08:50
No; the answer is "no".
@_date: 2016-05-28 12:18:57
Is this meant to be a parody?
@_date: 2016-05-28 18:00:14
Yes, I understand. However, since this is not a parody, it must be some other kind of joke - it's unclear to me what that joke is, though.
@_date: 2018-12-06 09:13:16
Look at all those bags he's left holding.

Oh right, thanks for clarifying that.
So how is coin generation regulated then? Is the block not accepted by the network if the coinbase transaction's output is larger than whatever the block reward is?
@_date: 2013-05-15 23:21:03
Hmm, according to the [protocol spec page](


So I imagine it contains the amount, as it can also split it between different addresses.
@_date: 2013-05-15 23:44:09
I'm sorry, it's kind of late here so I might be wrong, but it seems to me that the note is saying exactly what I was claiming earlier:
The coinbase transaction's value is given by the sum of the output values and the block is checked before being added to the blockchain so that the coinbase transaction's value does not exceed the intended BTC value + transaction fee. You'd need to check the whole block anyway, to make sure the transaction fee isn't too large.

I am located in Europe, which is a pitty since most services seem geared to USA.
Is Localbitcoins just an exchange platform?
@_date: 2013-05-15 22:55:53


I thought the difficulty scaled automatically such that new bitcoins are harder and harder to find. At one point (in 2140 or something), the difficulty will be infinite so no more bitcoins will be discovered - I'm having a hard time understanding how new blocks will be added in that case.
