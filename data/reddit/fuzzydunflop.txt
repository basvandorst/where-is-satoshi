1) buy a $30 printer from wal mart ( the offline kind)
2) You can install a Linux LiveCD and it will boot into Linux (unplug your internet) and create wallet from there.  You can print paper wallet with bitaddress.com java from github or armory etc

That won't work for me because I am trying to set up an Armory wallet and it requires bitcoinQT to sync

@_date: 2014-03-03 06:13:55
Any other tips? Nothing has worked so far...

Can't blame a business wanting to limit their risk.

Yes it loaded from file all the way up to 16 weeks left - then started syncing from internet I assume
@_date: 2014-03-02 23:24:40
Yes I have even delted the entire data folder / reinstalling / same thing

I've been getting 0.3kB/s or less for the past half hour =/ - 14 seeders, 58 peers.  Should I just give it some time or try and find a different download solution?  Usually don't have issues like that with torrents.
edit n/m did some googling and reverted to an earlier version 2.2.1 of utorrent and speeds are fine now

random joe probably doesn't need to go to that length to protect it.  and I think random joe can find a printer lmao
Also, BTC is not really meant for random joe at the moment imo.  Ease of use for all of this will get better over time
@_date: 2014-03-17 11:24:54
Yea I've looked into that I may end up using that.  Wanted to use armory because it seems more user friendly 
plus this shouldnt really be an issue right?  theres gotta be a way to make this work im baffled

What format do I do -connect with? like -connect 66.221.254.76  or -connect roland.beyondweb.net ? neither seems to connect

That's cool he mentioned the game "To The Moon" - Brilliant game.

ok ty I will try that.  Is there a way to put these blocks on my external HD?  I have a smallerish SSD and it takes up a lot of space.
@_date: 2014-03-17 10:49:09
definitely connected, have seen up to 30 peers at one point
the debug file seems to be growing too
