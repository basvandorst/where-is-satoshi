IF hypothetically you lost the keys to your bitcoin wallet because your girlfriend threw out your old laptop you used to mine bitcoin would you still have to pay taxes?
@_date: 2019-03-07 13:03:31
Sounds cool..
What does that mean for me financially?

Didn't the yellow vest movement vow to take all their money out of the banks?
Might be working.

I am, that's why I'm invested in btc.
However I would like to know how much btc I could mine in the background using my new android phone and how long it would take.

You beat me to it... but yes haha cryptocitadel ftw.

You will get roasted regardless because people will have to confront themselves with being ignorant and anytime that happens they project their ignorance onto you.
This doesn't relate to bitcoin but sales in general and I found out that promoting the benefits of your product over others is not very effective. 
For example I was growing weed (legally) for personal use and I just mentioned to friends why I don't buy weed from the store/coffeeshops as they are grown by unlicensed criminals because the grower market is unregulated here. 
They use hairspray to fake the weed being extra sticky as that is supposed to be a marker of good quality. I mentioned the criminals are known to use lead in the water before it is absorbed by the plant so the weed buds feels heavier per gram and how they use illegal toxic pesticides to prevent bugs and molds from ruining the plant. 
Suddenly, every time I explained the reasons to friends why I grew my own weed it had the unintentional effect of them offering to buy my homegrown weed even though I didn't mention anything about its qualities being good or bad. All they knew was that the current products they were getting from the shops could be very harmfull to their health in the long run and that I had found a better alternative.
Same thing applies to the situation of fiat currency and cryptocurrency. 
People would rather hold on to fiat currency because they don't understand the system, where the value comes from and why it is harmful to them in the long run.
Another piece of advice comes from the Shark tank show and apparently your pitch gets the best results when you share a top 5 on why people shouldn't invest in your idea because people are always on their guard with a mindset of "where is the catch?" and when you present it to them before they start digging, they will have a higher opinion of you and more willing to listen.

It is money paid over a lifetime to the employer by the employee for holding because of tax incentives, it isn't the employers money to pay out in the first place, it's just an intermediary.
You want to trash the OP's intelligence but you seem to be totally uninformed regarding the topic.
@_date: 2019-10-08 14:50:56
You are uninformed.
Pension funds, 401k or whatever name is used in your country it is the similar across the world where pension fund managers are obligated to put 50% in government bonds which happen to be failing worldwide for the coming decades. The other 50% is divided among real estate, stocks and weapon manufacturers, but real estate and stocks are in the biggest bubble ever. Temporary sollutions being implemented are cutting back retirement money that people receive by 1% every year and raising the retirement age requirement every few years.
The situation with GE is NOT a rare example and many more will follow. Pensions will be a thing of the past within a decade or two.

Nobody doubts that Bitcoin won't last but the question is how long. I'd give it another 20 years before it comes obsolete and replaced.
@_date: 2019-09-03 12:23:06
I am, just bought the dip but if I can get another $500 worth of free btc this year that turns 10x next year I will have gotten $5k for free.
@_date: 2019-09-03 11:02:45
And how much has it lost in the past 10 years?
@_date: 2019-09-03 11:47:28
I already accepted that I am the product, might as well get the most value out of this.
@_date: 2019-09-03 14:40:12
Okey, got anything to add to the list?
@_date: 2019-09-03 11:07:14
Wall Street is already pumping in billions every month into the cryptospace and the US government is currently hiring miners to mine crypto for them so we're already past any coordinated attacks on BTC. They're joining the cryptospace not fighting it.

I have 4 jobs, how about you?

Easiest, fastest and most secure platform to transfer my fiat to crypto.

1 BTC 100K Scenario
- People with crypto will be the new status symbol and we'll have the media glorify many crypto pioneers.
- Global financial crisis will have occurred making the gap between the wealthy and poor even greater and by then it's not a money gap that is the concern but an opportunity gap. The poor will not be able to afford education, healthcare, transport or housing whereas the wealthy will have the best of everything. 
- Banks and governments will publicly campaign against cryptocurrency while privately stacking up as much as possible.
1 BTC 1 Million Scenario
- Total devaluation of fiat currency worldwide similar to what is happening today in Venezuela, finalizing the divide between HAVES and HAVENOTS. 99% will struggle to survive while the 1% have a lavish Jetsons livestyle, IE autonomous vehicles and robot servants.
- Governments and banks hold no power over the people and will have to change their dominance and exploitation strategy to one of servitude to the people. 
Governments will switch to transparent blockchain applications where you can vote weekly on local issues through your smartphone. Many banks will dissapear but some will stay around similar to how postoffices, public libraries and horse carriages are still around.
- Without proper government services, law enforcement and healthcare will only be available for the priviliged.
- Currently only 5% of the crypto population is female and invested in cryptocurrency and that will be most obvious when BTC hits 1 million. Women will be empoverished the most and it will change gender dynamics in the western world back to more traditional forms, at least for cryptocurrency holders as women will throw themselves at them. Consequently male cryptocurrency holders will be targeted often by the rest of the male population that is struggling to survive day by day and cryptoholders will be forced to live in "citadels" with private security.
