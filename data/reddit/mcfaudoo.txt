Oh shit I can short bitcoin now? 
Yes please

There’s your answer. You’ve never been offered help like this because random internet strangers don’t go around offering this kind of “help.”
A good rule of thumb: if it looks too good to be true, it probably is.
Another good rule: you probably shouldn’t be doing this if you couldn’t immediately tell this is a scam. You’re going to lose all your money.

“Obscure” would also be fine

I'm not sure that MMM is a Ponzi scheme per se. It has been set up to work exactly like one, but one aspect it seems to need (that MMM lacks) is that the activities are fraudulent. In my brief reading about MMM, it seems that this guy has set up a pyramid and has money flowing through it and then told everyone it was a Ponzi scheme BEFORE they invested in it. I think that's why no legal action was taken against him, because people knew exactly what they were paying their money into and never expected any sort of legitimate business or investment on the other end. Him telling everyone it was a Ponzi scheme actually made it not be a Ponzi scheme, at least in the eyes of many legal systems. 
For this discussion though, they are basically the same. It's not good for a company like this to be so closely associated with bitcoin.

If you couldn’t immediately tell this is a scam, then sorry to say crypto isn’t for you right now. 
It’s a fairly unregulated space with lots of scammers right now and the fact that you needed to ask if this very obvious scam is a scam means another, better scammer is going to take your money.

I've posted this in a few other places on here, but it's so clearly a pyramid scheme because they want everyone to know its a pyramid scheme. Pyramid schemes are mostly legal in most places, but telling everyone to invest in your legitimate business when it really is a pyramid scheme is fraud. This way they can legally take money from people, and people give them money because they think "hey as long as I'm smarter than 90% of the other people paying in and I get out first, I make a lot of money." That's true of course, but only 10% of those people can actually get out before the collapse.

Thanks for clearing some of that stuff up. It sounds a lot like he got in over his head on some of this stuff. Still, on another part of this thread he said he's paying $100k/month to some guy to develop this software. That just seems like some level of incompetency to me.
@_date: 2014-11-14 02:39:58
Wow you sound like a very shady person
@_date: 2014-11-17 01:30:15
Because Ponzi Schemes are legal, but telling everyone it's a legitimate business when it's really a Ponzi scheme is fraud. In 1994 he tricked everyone into investing in it. In 2011 he said "hey everyone look at my Ponzi scheme come invest." I can see how some would be tempted: if you're one of the first withdrawers of a Ponzi scheme, you can get back your initial investment plus a large profit. Usually because it's fraudulent activity anyone who successfully withdrew loses that money anyway as the government attempts to pay back all the creditors equally with the recovered funds.

That link you posted says literally nothing about pump and dump. Anyways the way that guy uses "pump and dump" is incorrect. A pump and dump is when you take something that is usually low-priced in any speculative market (be it bitcoins, the stock market, or other regulated commodities), buy a large percentage of these (like for it to really work you should be able to purchase 30-50% of the total commodity), artificially raise said stock or commodity's price, and then once others buy in and the price gets significantly higher, "dump" all that you own, making sure you make a lot of money but at the same time sending the price of that stock/commodity shooting down. So saying bitcoin is a pump and dump scheme is like saying stocks are a pump and dump scheme. It's incorrect. The stock market and bitcoin markets are surely open to having people use pump and dump schemes through them, and anyone trying to pull a scheme like this would probably try to do it through a lesser-regulated financial entity like bitcoin, but bitcoin is inherently a currency, not inherently a scheme. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 16:46:42
You're correct in that they're similar. A pump and dump IS basically a small artificial speculative bubble created by a few who will profit from it. The problem with saying they're the same thing is that one is a man-made illegal and pretty despicable act, while the other is a naturally occurring economic phenomenon. In speculative bubbles and in pump and dump schemes, and investor will see the price rising or hear reasons why the price should rise and invest. Even if you know it's a bubble, some people still try to invest because "hey if you get your money out at the top if the bubble, you'll make a lot of money." In a speculative bubble, every investor has the same amount of chance to pull out of the bubble before it pops, and therefore all share the same amount of risk. In a pump and dump scheme, investors are basically being duped and have almost no chance of getting out before the collapse, because when the "dump" happens, it's already too late. The investors take all the risk while the perpatrators take none and make off with all their money. Basically a speculative bubble is a house of cards, but a pump and dump scheme is a house of cards with some asshole ready to pull out the bottom card as soon as you finish putting the top one on.

No, no it’s not. It’s invented because you need a word for something instead of describing a concept every time you want to talk about a concept. Like, you know, how every other word came to be.
Instead of whining that people are gatekeeping you by using terms you don’t understand, how about you just learn the terms?
@_date: 2019-03-07 17:19:55
As more people enter the space, manipulation become harder and harder. Increased adoption (and I know it’s a dirty word, but a certain amount of necessary regulation) will deal with this issue.

I love it when people make really poorly written, poorly thought out comments that add nothing and make sweeping generalizations, and then try to blame it on some conspiracy of a company downvoting them instead of realizing their posts are dogshit
@_date: 2019-04-16 20:47:32
Cmon man. The only thing that makes it like a pyramid is that you described it like a pyramid. What if the third guy buys 30% of the market after his buddy bought 25%? And then the 4th guy buys 45% off the first guy? Sorta ruins your tidy pyramid shape, which was the only part of your comment that sounded like a pyramid scheme.
I don’t really have time right now to go more in depth right now but I can drop you some links later that explain some entry-level financial concepts (and no, non are bitcoin “brochures” or really about bitcoin at all).

I get what you’re trying to say but it seems like you really don’t understand what a pyramid scheme is.

Sure murder for hire charges were dropped... after he had exhausted all his legal recourse and his appeal was denied by the Supreme Court. IIRC the New York and Maryland justice departments said something to the effect of “justice has been served (aka he’s never getting out anyway), we’re dropping these charges to use the resources other places.”
In my opinion there’s pretty damning evidence that he tried to have someone killed. I can’t really support someone like that, although if that factored into the ridiculous amount of time he got for drug charges then it is kinda fucked that he didn’t get his due process for those crimes.

It just doesn’t.
Why would the size of a company have anything to do with adoption of a currency?

Almost everything you've said here I either disagree with or is just flat-out wrong. 
Since I don't have much time to respond this morning I'll just ask: what is your definition of a "token" and what is your justification for calling ETH that?
And I'll also say that just because every crypto's price has been loosely tied to BTC so far doesn't mean that different blockchain projects that don't aim to be currencies are inherently tied to the BTC price. In fact ETH has already begun to separate from the BTC movements.

Nice story. Too bad it's apparent from your story that you don't really understand what a pump and dump is. Not sure why you call yourself a "cryptofinanceexpert" when you don't understand basic financial concepts.
