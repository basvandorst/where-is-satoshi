I'm having a different problem. For me there is no "pay with bitcoin" option at all.

Thanks for the response.
No, not there. All I have is a single radio button offering credit/debit cards. When I click to the next page, it asks for the card details. No bitcoin option.
If I had to guess why, I'd say it's 'cos I'm in Europe. Are you in the US? Sigh... bitcoin seems to only work elsewhere.
Edit: I'm also using Firefox on Ubuntu. I hope that's not what's failing though.

Yup, you got it. I get the bitcoin option on the UK site, but then I can't insert the correct address.
I could go with parcel motel, but then there could be warranty problems. So... back to the drawing board.
Thanks for your help isolating the problem.

Just chatted with Dell support - the rep said "right now we do not have that [bitcoin] option", when I asked when the option would be reinstated they replied they have no update regarding that at the moment.
So... gotta go buy my laptop &amp; 4k monitor elsewhere :-/  Anyone have any good suggestions in Europe/UK? I'm looking for a 27" 4K monitor, and a laptop with 16GB RAM, 256 or 512GB SSD, at least quad-core, preferable 13" but 15" is ok too. I was gonna grab a xps 15".
paging - did you get any further info from dell? thx.

I'm not sure I agree. The fork today is due to people not upgrading their software, and the new (v3?) blocks being created immediately after the 95% threshold was passed (right?). I recall the 8MB proposal included a 2 week grace period to allow everyone to upgrade on time.
I don't think we'll see this kind of problem. Either it won't hit the 75% threshold for 8MB blocks and there's no problem, or it will hit it and everyone will upgrade (or be on the losing chain).
I think the very controversy surrounding the block size debate will ensure that the actual fork itself won't be a problem.

This is nothing short of spectacular. If this could be pulled off it will make the blocksize decision easy - the correct choice will be obvious, and it will give the world an amazing insight into PMs and the applicability of truthcoin to almost any real-world decision.

If Grexit happens and the EU goes full crazy, they'll possibly kick Greece right out of the EU and the free trade zone. Meaning you'd have to start paying import taxes etc. What then?
Other posters have wondered what would a Greek do with bitcoins. Well, that's easy. They could buy stuff from the internets which they can't do right now. It's the bootstrap problem and it's not a problem as long as you don't suddenly have 100% of an economy jump on board all at once. Just a little bit at a time.

Interesting. You may be right that not that many extra people are actually *buying* bitcoin. But there is unquestionably increased interest. There are media articles popping up everywhere!

Help me to understand something though, and I think it's important. With a soft fork old nodes will still accept new blocks but new nodes won't accept old blocks. Whereas with a hard fork it's the other way, right?
So when the blocksize hardfork comes up, even if &gt;50% are SPV mining, it won't make a difference. Because all the blocks will be valid for the new nodes, and the majority of nodes will be already new nodes 'cos we've already hit the 75% threshold.
Am I understanding this right?
I think what happened yesterday won't be an issue with the blocksize fork for this reason, and also because everyone's gonna know all about the upcoming blocksize fork. It might even be on CNN at that stage :-)
