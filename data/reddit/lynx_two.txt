Can I repurpose my Antminer S9s to compress every frame of HEVC video to be as small as possible?  Now that would be worth $400 a month in electricity ������

I feel like there’s a lot of people out there who fit this description

That’s a really valid point.  All it would take is a firmware/software upgrade...

At least you’re not the guy that mortgaged his house and bought in at $19k lol. I don’t know if that actually happened but part of me really hoped it did

Where can you buy graphics cards with crypto?

I do have 3 Antminer S9s coming in Friday ��. Got the three power supplies last night.  Now I’ll just have to figure out how to cut down on the sound.

And of course the site was a scam, still fun math though :D

I updated the calculations to include estimated taxes owed based on the tax laws, and now you can see what your hash-rate and potential return would be using an auto-clicker and re-investing every minute for between 1-12 months.  The sheet also does a web-query every minute and updates the price of BitCoin.

Keep in mind the really important stuff has its own OS, they don’t rely on Linux, mac, or Windows.

Likely related to a Linux / Unix kernel, but yea, they don’t have/need admins for that stuff.  It is what it is at those levels.  Keep in mind when stuff is buried that deep and doesn’t require updates, running on the same hardware year in year out, and has a specific purpose, you don’t need the same levels of support.  Plus, since no one knows about it, and it’s off the internet and just on its own local intranet, there’s no need for security at the same level
