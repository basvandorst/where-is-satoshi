That is pure FUD. I have to wonder how spreading it benefits you. Can you point to the announcement where they say they're supporting Segwit2x?
Anyway, Coinbase already made multiple [blog]( [posts]( saying that they'll only support one version of any given cryptocurrency. Their policy is clear. If they send an email telling people to withdraw their coins if they're worried about a potential fork then it's totally within the standards of how they already operate. They did the same for BCH. Why do you think it's an amazing insight that they'll do it for the S2X fork?
Of course, they also reneged on their fork policy by offering to [deposit BCH]( in peoples' accounts.
So regardless of what you think they announced or what will actually happen, they can always change their mind.

Withdrawing BTC from Coinbase doesn't hurt them at all. They don't make money holding your BTC. They don't lose money when you transfer it out to another wallet.
They make their money when you exchange USD for BTC or vice-versa. So threatening to just transfer the BTC out doesn't really have an impact. In fact, they suggested that everyone worried about the Bitcoin Cash spit withdraw their BTC a few months ago.
If you want to take an action that actually will harm their business, you need to close your account and go with a competitor that hasn't signed on in support of the NYA.
But they also get over 10,000 new users easy day, so it's hard to say if a few people closing their accounts will have much of an effect.
