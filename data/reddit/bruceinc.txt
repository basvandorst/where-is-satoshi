My bank will allow up to 10k draw without any prior notice, with notice that number is only limited by the amount of money in your account.

If I heard DCB Out of context I would initially assume drugs not some random color

you can add as many dots as you want it will still work, problem is you wont be able to intuitively know where you signed up with the dot so it really doesnt help much unless you create filters in your gmail so abc.defg goes to one folder and ab.cdefg goes to another and a.b.c.d.e.f.g goes to third etc. It has its uses but the +company method has much better way of tracing source of your sold email

You can not buy lotto tickets with cc, at least in my state. Upon further research only about 20 states do allow cc for lotto tickets. All those other things you listed are not investments so your point does not apply here. Credit cards are issued by banks and financial institutions, and when/if you go bankrupt they are the ones left holding the bag. I can’t fault the banks for trying to cover their bases by limiting cc purchases in such a volatile space.  If you factor in the interest rates for credit cards, plus the crazy price fluctuation if the crypto market, it is very easy to see why using cc for investing is extremely risky. The stock market has a whole system set up for purchases using credit, it’s called margin and there are very strict and specific regulations on how much stock you can buy using the margin. There are crypto exchange platforms that allow margins for purchasing of crypto, if you want to spend money you don’t have on crypto, you do have alternatives outside of using your credit cards. Overall this decision by the banks is going to save a lot of people from financial ruin. Just my point of view.

I, personally, applaud that move by the banks. Investing in such a volatile venture with cc is a terrible idea, and sometimes the people just need to be saved from themselves. You can’t buy stocks or bonds or even lotto tickets with cc, why should crypto be any different!?

No it’s not! this crash was in part because of the news of the subpoena as well as a mix of other news/fud. Once the actual manipulation is confirmed we will see a crash that will make this one look like a minor speed bump

I don’t mind waiting. Just started building a house plus have a wedding coming up, so my disposable income for investing has been significantly reduced. With Coinbase finally implementing segwit, bittrex adding usd pairs and Robinhood entering into the crypto space I think we will see some big big things in the near future. It’s just always nice to have other options. Never know when they might become useful. Especially if all of a sudden you need to convert large sums to fiat or vice versa.

Made an account on there as well as soon as they became available in USA. Thanks

It might go down some but it certainly wouldn’t crash as it did. He sold a ton of coins at the bottom, toppling prices even further. There were better ways to handle that and raise the necessary funds.

I’ve been feeling the same way. Made a new account on Gemini. Waiting to get verified. Might give them a try for fiat to crypto movements.

It’s not your credit it’s the bank’s credit. Credit is a privilege not a right. You forget that part.

Again, if you look at the system as a whole you are correct, but on an individual level you can be denied credit. That’s why we have scores and other tools for banks to determine eligibility. It’s a bank’s right to give you credit. If you think it’s a burden, don’t use it... especially for buying crypto

Not using credit = living 100% within your means, but we want more than what we can afford just using the money we actually earned, so we buy stuff on credit, giving the banks all the power and then get mad when they “abuse” that power. 
If you want to buy crypto using money you don’t actually have, then use margins, instead of paying 25+% interest rates to these banks you seem to hate so much
