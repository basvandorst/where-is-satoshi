This might just be my limited understanding, but looking at the code for the lightning wallets I have used to far that are based on Neutrino they allow me to point at my own full node if I want. The option to go either based on specific nodes or on PoW is not really something that relates to Neutrino. Some wallets follow PoW with SPV as well, e.g. BRD on iOS which is one of the most used SPV wallets.
Again this might just be me not understanding something but it looks like the criticisms of Neutrino pretty much apply to specific wallet implementations, and to SPV as well, in which case it is mostly FUD. Again SPV doesn't work with lightning, so effectively without Neutrino it will mean **all** mobile wallets that support lightning will need to be custodial.

I reckon if every local business, is running a node there will be enough decentralization in the financial system to make the advantage of your parents running one for themselves probably not worth it, but it is gonna be interestint to see how it all plays out.
Oh yeah totally agree, it is a mobile UX thing there not SPV issue.

Reading up on the full thread:
1. The shop accepts Bitcoin
2. The OP gave a cash tip as well
In other words this is like if you went in to a shop, paid for your stuff, and gave a tip. Then you saw that shop shared a common interest like say surfing, so you also left a $10 voucher for a surf shop up the coast, and the voucher expires end of the month.
Sure it would be a lot of trouble to redeem the voucher and difficult to split between the employees, but you already paid and tipped. This was just a random gift to a group of strangers cause you saw they shared an interest with you and you wanna spread the love to people that share that interest.
I get that tipping people with religious trinkets or other nonsense is a dick move, especially so in countries where tipping is part of their normal wage. This was clearly not that. I think it was great on the part of OP.

Ah okay :) Your position totally makes sense if you are against all SPV wallets. Zap is also great if you are running a node. I am personally pro light clients for the following reason: 
I think we are having a similar debate now to the one at the start of the internet: everyone will have their own server/website or we will all connect to Microsoft or some government servers. The answer was somewhere in the middle, most businesses (and techies) have their own server and people connect to those, but the average person doesn't run a server.
I think in Bitcoin it will be the same. Average people won't run nodes but most businesses (and techies) will run nodes. I do think it is nice for all the average people to be able to connect to someone else's full node without giving that full node the details of their transactions and their private keys.
We already see that most "users" in the ecosystem run nodes, and given a choice between coinbase and BRD I would rather they run BRD. I don't think it gives more power to the miners because I don't think it affects the full node count. People who want to run nodes will run them anyway. The SPV/Neutrino wallets compete with Coinbase and other custodial providers not with full nodes.

I mean some people did believe you would have a computer in every home :P In that debate it turned out we would. The internet turned out differently. I'm not saying that it is unreasonable in the Bitcoin debate to believe everyone will have a full node. Just that I personally reckon we will land somewhere in the middle where only certain people do as I see the complexity of running a full node more inline with running a server than a personal computer. It will be exciting to see how this plays out.
On the miner thing, I disagree with that. The alternative is a custodial wallet managed by probably managed by Coinbase who can easily collude with miners and has an even greater chance of following the miners. In fact the miners know ahead of time due to private agreement that coinbase will follow. We are not gaining anything in respect of power over miners by making people switch to coinbase instead of a light client.
Samouri isn't on iOS but other than that I agree that is probably the best wallet. From a UX point of view though green address and electrum don't come anywhere close. I think the download counts and store reviews make this pretty much factual.

Using Neutrino is aligned with your first suggestion there. The point is  that when you "connect to someone else's full node" it would be useful if you could a) preserve as much privacy between you and them as possible b) use the lightning network. From my understanding at least :)

This article is based on this data: 
The actual volumes if you trust their methods are available on this site:

Nope, the target audience is big blockers hence ver.com, the source is the creator of the protocol which is available here: 
@_date: 2017-04-24 10:59:26
BitPay, Coinbase etc. already exist. This protocol allows them to move transactions between each other off-chain. It is a short term scaling solution for Bitcoin companies until the lightning network exists. It could decrease the pressure from industry for short term on-chain scaling solutions. Decreasing industry support for bigger blocks by giving them an alternative helps users and developers move to Segwit and Lightning in the long term.
@_date: 2017-04-24 15:11:08
That was done here: 
Agreed about bitcoin.com, still useful to get things on there in order to convert big blockers. Eg. hopefully Bitcoin.com will have lots of lightning network content when it eventually launches.
@_date: 2017-04-24 12:19:29
Incorrect, it is repeatedly stated in the interview that this is a "short term" solution and that is can co-exist with lightning and does not block it.

The article is on bitcoin.com because moonbeam is targeted at companies with problems scaling Bitcoin transactions, many of whom support big blocks. If moonbeam can fix their scaling problems they might stop supporting big blocks. Thus the target audience is many people on bitcoin.com. That doesn't mean you have to trust it, instead you can verify the protocol itself:

In Satoshis:
**Price in 2010**: 1,000,000,000,000 sat (one trillion satoshis)
**Price in 2018**: 649,000 sat (six hundred and forty nine thousand satoshis)
**Price in 2026**: ?

There might be some misunderstanding but as far as I know that _is_ the way it is done. On the confirmation screen you are shown the amount of BTC you will get for a buy (or amount of local currency for a sell). This amount should include all fees and rate calculations and when you confirm you get that amount exactly. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 11:54:40
I just checked my transaction history and instant buy/sells just appear as a single item Bought X for Y. Just like the confirmation screen says. There are also separate "Trading fee" items in my history but these match taker orders on the exchange. I have low volume so I pay 1% for taker orders so I have things like: "Bought 0.08 BTC/ZAR @ 60,000 BTC 0.08" and then right after "Trading fee BTC -0.0008". For instant buy/sells it just looks like "Bought 0.1 BTC for ZAR 6540" with no separate fee entry.

The fees you're talking about are currency conversion fees on an exchange not Bitcoin network fees. The Luno dynamic fees usually work out quite well for me. I have paid between 130 and 250 sat/byte for my recent transactions. If I go to send some Bitcoin right now the recommended fee is: BTC 0.00051256. Which should work out to around 240 sat/byte for my transaction, and which is also similar to the recommended fee to get a transaction confirmed in the next hour according to: 
As for the currency conversion fees themselves. Luno's exchange lists 0% maker and 0.5-1% taker (based on volume) fees here:  I'm sure the quick currency conversion is more expensive but 5-10% doesn't sound realistic. Most likely you are experiencing slippage and comparing your rate to the mid market rate not the actual rate given on the final confirmation page when doing the conversion.

Which currency are you buying in?

Why spend money when you could leave it in a interest earning account, or leave it in stocks, or in property? Well because you want to buy stuff of course.

More like 90% when measured accurately:
