Today I wanted to make a transaction worth of €82 in btc to buy something, but I had to pay €9 network fee. Is this amount of fee normal?

Thanks for your answer, but I still don’t really get it. I’m using a ledger wallet now where I can store multiple cryptos with the applications but if for some reason the applications don’t work or something, can I use my private key to import all cryptos that were stored on my ledger to an other wallet?

I have a noob question about crypto, are all public addresses someway attached to my private key? So for example if I delete my btc/ltc/ etc. Wallet can I restore it later on a different Wallet with my private key?

Im from the Netherlands, the ad is a disgusting shitty newspaper spreading lies. It’s a shame it has many readers. I suspect them for accepting payments for publishing (false) articles. How else is it possible to spread so much shitty articles based on lies..

What do you guys think will happen with the btc price when futures are introduced?
I think it will go down ( I hope im wrong) because now people only make money when to price goes up. But with futures people can make money when to price goes down.
