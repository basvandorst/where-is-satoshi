Just did the same thing! 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:06:34
It’s terrible 
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:19:00
I’ve lost so much money gambling the last couple of years, but I’ve joined. I would just say if you do buy bitcoin, be careful not too fall for the same things as I did. As bitcoin would go up I would profit and then I would send some bitcoin to a gambling site and gamble it all away eventually. This became a cycle, and I have missed out on a lot of gains if I would of just held and not gambled. 
If you do get in bitcoin, buy a nano s Ledger and send it all there. That way it’s secure and you can’t send it to a gambling site so quickly. Best of luck!

Will we regret it? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:03:19
Great read, thank you! 
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:08:17
It’s happening right now.... dippin on up
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:02:05
Ok cool thanks for the help! 
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:30:20
Why not, it’s just money. You can always make it back. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:17:59
Futures coming up this month. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:43:38
Wait some more until it hits 20k, then get on here and ask the same question. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:05:26
Edit 47k profit. Don’t believe me? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:35:53
Welcome! Hope you make some money with the rest of us.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:37:01
Well at-least you’re still in the game with BTC. Just a much longer game now. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:48:42
100k 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:30:43
You paid a fee on coinbase for purchasing bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:04:13
I have serious regret. I had 146 LTC in June and sold it. I’d be up 42k in profit if I had sold it now. Fuck me. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:22:47
Should I buy their penny stock as well? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:00:17
You only live once, but you still need to eat, shelter, and clothing. Fuck it right? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:01:30
No, I just wanted a reliable site, since I’d prefer not too lose my coins. You understand what I’m saying? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:33:48
Sell me your girlfriend 
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:01:56
You’re right 
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:18:41
100k salary may sound like a lot, but cost of living is very high where I’m at. And if I want the money I have to work for it definitely. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:09:07
Yes it does 
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:15:13
I’m in it! 
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:05:17
I have 25k in debt. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:00:54
What would your recommend getting that 12k up too?
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:18:09
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:10:28
Uncle Sam, likes his fair share of course. I’m only 24 I haven’t been so good at this whole managing money thing...
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:51:01
I hope you’re right! 
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:17:04
Thank you! It’s feels good. Im ok with losing it all, but obviously it would hurt. I’m 24 And I’m trying very hard to save. Thanks for the advice! 
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:35:36
I’ve only been on the job for a year. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:48:30
My whole thing is I look at my bank account for comparison all the time.  I want to get my 40% lower.
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:13:58
I’ve owned more, but would always sell no more than three weeks later. I’m one of those guys that believes the money in my bank account is the money that counts. Aha I know weird, but it’s just how I am. That’s why I struggle with holding. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:50:56
That’s the funniest thing I’ve ever heard. What an idiot. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:23:37
Thanks for the reply, I have 3500 DGB I know shitty but hey who knows a couple of years from now. I definitely cannot day trade it! Just want to have steady hands. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:27:54
I have to look up what that is! Aha 
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:14:37
I feel like I should have more saved. I’m really hard On myself for that. Aren’t we all though. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:56:59
What do you mean it maybe overloaded at that savings level? And yes 20k would be correct. I feel like I should have more aha. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:04:39
15k
