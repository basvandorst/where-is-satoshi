I sold 280 ETH at $32 a piece. No, I did not kill myself
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:23:55
Oh and I sold 280 ETH at $35 each that I paid $14 for...so like $300k lost.....

Keep holding on! I hate the dips, but its part of the lifestyle
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:48:23
I think they only hold 3 types of coins per device
@_date: 2018-05-23 23:24:19
Good start. I find off beat music distracting
@_date: 2018-05-11 22:46:28
awwww. How long was the install?
@_date: 2018-05-30 23:12:21
I'm going to go buy myself tonight before bed and again in the morning
@_date: 2018-05-14 19:03:22
Looks like there are some massive fee's on that app
@_date: 2018-05-30 23:13:10
How many bitcoins would need to be purchased to cause a massive price increase?
@_date: 2018-05-16 21:51:11
Well now we know who all the failed [Coin]( credit card hardware got sold to
Looks legit though. QR charging would make this an instant buy for me
@_date: 2018-05-23 18:53:31
I agree. I wish outside investors would talk how bitcoin has more than doubled since this time last year. They only focus on how it hit $19k and dropped to current levels and they say that negative.

Adding more ETC now! I bought my LTC the day is was listed on CB and can't complain! Hey neighbor!
@_date: 2018-06-10 05:17:12
Get some meat on dem bones!!
@_date: 2018-06-26 20:08:59
Your comment motivated me to purchase more BTC and LTC. My future self thanks you.
@_date: 2018-06-10 05:28:48
Keep holding 
@_date: 2018-06-25 15:44:14
You don't remember Tub Girl do you
@_date: 2018-06-10 05:26:00
Buy more.
@_date: 2018-06-10 05:17:45
Let's do this thang - Maya Angelou
@_date: 2018-06-26 20:36:55
nah I wish. I actually owned some LTC when it was around that price on BTC-E waaaay back. I got in on CB around $30, sold some at ATH and started buying back when I can
@_date: 2019-12-19 18:26:59
ahh my bad. I first saw this someone begging for BTC
@_date: 2019-12-19 18:19:28
I sent up a "In case of death or prison" instructions for my family to get whatever I have left in crypto.
@_date: 2019-12-19 18:16:23
Yeah I'll send you 1 BTC for sure!! You have come to the right location where everyone gives away money for no reason! First you need to send me 0.2 BTC to confirm your address lololol
@_date: 2018-04-26 23:27:13
If I were him I would give anyone half of my bitcoins if they find the hard drive. Thats good motivation for people to start the worlds most epic dumpster dive
@_date: 2018-04-10 22:27:07
So this is what happened to all the failed Coin credit care replacement. Not sure its the same, but looks almost identical
[Coin Card](
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:50:24
This a good option before August 1st? Or better to sell all BTC from Coinbase?
@_date: 2018-12-20 22:09:39
Fake for sure. I get them weekly. Also, if they really did have video of you beating off let them send it out. Everyone does it so meh
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:18:55
I received one of these emails at 11am Pacific today. I suspect they are using different addresses. The address given to me have received zero payments as of writing this post.
