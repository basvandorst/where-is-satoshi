That's anecdotal evidence. You need to look at the average transaction times and cost.

What's your point?

How did you pay for the service? Can you check your transaction records? That might give you a clue about the site.

Still better than 4chan.

Based on PayPals marketcap of $90.92 billon USD, of there were 21 million shares/tokens the price would be approximately $4329 USD.

That's a good point. I imagine it may be somewhat correlated with the market-cap valuation?

As an a solid believer in crypto I would still encourage you to focus on your business. No one knows how long this crypto party will last but a well run business could potentially last a lifetime. The tech is here for good but know one knows if the economic growth is sustainable. Obviously this depends on your business and how's it's run. If your business is successful you can see much greater than 100% returns over time. 
You can always reinvest a portion your profits into crypto (although I would recommend that you also invest in traditional markets such as sticks and index funds). Also I need to practice what I'm preaching here. I've made great returns investing in crypto but I think it might be time for me to start better diversifying my profits into other assets.  
Merry Christmas!

Assuming a computer that could perform 10 billion calculations per second... generating all the possible wallet addresses would take approximately:
**174,065,739,377,532,450,000,000,000 quadragintillion years** (a quadragintillion is 10^(123))
So I think we'll be fine for a while.

Yeah, he comes across as a bit of an ass in this video but he gets away with it for being so brilliant.    
I haven't! Sounds fascinating, I'll have to watch it. Thanks for the tip.
