Poor bird :/

17 is an overstatement.
@_date: 2018-11-23 04:53:23
Yeah, because the us is achually 250% of the market and crypto isn't used or talked about anywhere else in the world.

Dude. Do your own research. Bitcoin is horrible energywise. There are way greener and efficient cryptos out there.
592KWh per transaction? the f outta here.

Unless you use solar/wind energy, only helping you are doing is you're helping to pollute the air..

Good to hear you are contributing to air pollution.

Yeah,  that's why I don't eat meat or dairy, don't own a car and live in a house that uses wind energy only.
But I actually NEED to move from a to b every now and then, and I actually NEED shelter and safety of a home.
I do not need or want to use 592KWh of energy per transaction. Bitcoin's energy inefficiency is insane. Can't wait for a better and greener crypto to take over.

The inconvenient truth.

Tether and bitfinex going under.

That's horrible, a bad argument, and it doesn't need to be that way. There are better cryptos than bitcoin. 592KWh / transaction is insane and not sustainable.
