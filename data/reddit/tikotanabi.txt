I have invested in it, but not in an extremely large capacity. I mostly made money off alt coins on exchanges and racked up about 10 BTC but unfortunately I had to cash out a few months back. I'm not current on what's going on so I can't give you the best investment advice as to the time, but I think it may have something to do with the news regarding Satoshi. There was a guy by the name of Wright claiming to be him, which would be HUGE for the bitcoin community. That caused a lot of news to cover it and when there's more coverage of bitcoin it always ends up causing the price to rise, everytime it's features prominently in the media. 
Personally, I'd wait til this Satoshi stuff dies down because people may just be capitalizing on it for some easy gains in the market. I'm a very conservative investor, scared to lose money. But that's one thing you need to consider when you're going in, do NOT invest more than you are willing to lose because things can come crashing down in a heart beat. An avalanche effect sometimes occurs when a whale (someone who holds a lot of BTC) sells a lot of coins. It can cause a small price dip, which others respond to, which eventually becomes an avalanche of price drop. 
Best to store any BTC you do buy on a hard drive (with a paper backup) and put them in a safety deposit box, safe, or some place you know it won't get stolen. Bitcoin gets stolen way too often by viruses, last thing you want to happen.

I've seen  compelling in the past and I've seen people pull off much bigger lies than this. Forgive me for being a skeptic, it's just that in this day and age people go around saying things that aren't true so often I have to wait for proof before I believe it.

At this point there's been so many people that were "probably" Nakamoto that were later disproven that I have no faith until he brings himself forward. Until I see coins moved from one of the wallets he had, I won't believe anybody.

Of course, that would do just as well.

Another thing by Wright I call bull shit on. Show me the transactions and I'll be more inclined to consider it, show me a signed address that belongs to Satoshi and I'll believe he's him.
Until that time, stop calling this fucker Bitcoin's founder.

Depends what you consider "prime" to be. Many believe that the $1,100 trading volume at Mt. Gox was artifically manipulated by a bot named Willy in order to cause the price to rise. There owuld have been a lot of money made by somebody in possession of a lot of bitcoins at the time. Some people even think it was that Mt. Gox was linked to Silkroad and a way to unload extra bitcoins. 
Article on Willy: 
I consider prime to be when it was trading around $600 for awhile, which we slowly but surely approaching.

I won't suspect anybody of being Satoshi because the only real person who knew who he was (Hal Finney, person who received first transaction of bitcoins) has passed away. The only way I'll ever even suspect, or believe anybody is if the bitcoins that belong to Satoshi are moved.

I believe Hal Finney was disproved as the creator of it, but it's mine (and many others) strong personal opinion that he knew the creator if he received the first transaction. There are also a bunch of other reasons which I'm too drunk &amp; high to search for an reference at the moment. Hal Finney was a very interesting guy! I encourage you to read about his life, he's criogenically(undoubtedly misspelled) preserved like Walt Disney is and was a major encryption activist early on.

He said no, but many believe that he did considering that he received the first bitcoin transaction, and a few others facts which I'm too impaired to search for and post. I highly encourage you to look into his life though! Incredibly interesting guy.

There's always people claiming that each and every year is the year bitcoin will skyrocket when in reality not a single person knows for sure how it's going to perform. Things happen in a given year, people gain and lose interest, the media can make a huge difference in the price of bitcoin, as it usually does. 
With all that being said, take every estimation of bitcoin with a grain of salt because any person promising that a certain price will be reached does not know what they are saying. If they are estimating and speculating and actually mention that this may not come to fruition, then I'm more likely to actually trust them as that person then becomes more knowledgeable in my mind.

I cringed when he said bitcoin's creator was helping him, then cringed further when he was referenced as "Sitoshi".

Unless demand increases there's no reason to think the supply will lessen for any other reason than people purchasing BTC to sell it at a higher price.
Better hop off at the right time kids, otherwise you'll have to be patient or take a loss.

The market is already fairly unsatured so unless interest picks up quite a bit I don't see there being a large price spike. Maybe an initial rise as people try to buy out BTC prior to the block halving, but I think it'll go back down more than likely once people make their quick buck. Unless I see interest from the public pick up and general understanding of bitcoin increase, I'm not really going to hold my breath.

Thanks, things make more sense to me now. Was wondering what the issue was.
