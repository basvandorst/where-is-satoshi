"An important implication is that because there may be multiple sending and receiving addresses per transaction record, one cannot assign a particular sending address to the funds being sent to a particular receiving address. A further implication of this observation is that one cannot assign serial numbers to bitcoins and trace their paths on the Bitcoin network."
Isn't each satoshi unique? i.e. each satoshi has an identifier for the block and coinbase when it was issued? Isnt that how you can track colored coins?

Not only that but robinhood sells your information forward to third parties. Your stock purchases, performance, behavior, etc. Since you are naturally more entwined to support products from stocks you own its a great marketing tool.

You are retarded. What the OP means is that bonds and stocks issued by companies don't have counter party risk. They only have default risk which is settled in bankruptcy court.

1) usually the other end of the transaction is used directly on a good/service purchase.
2) Fractional reserve banking is possible, if and only if, users surrender custody of their bitcoins. As long as the user is in custody of their funds there is no way to lend without the user knowing that his funds have been lent and are not accessable to be spent. When a user knows his funds are not accessable to be spent it is no longer fractional reserve banking.

He does a poor job at answering the ex-goldman sachs trader's question.

As the video says, fractional reserve banking exacerbates the business cycle. If you take a look at the Chicago Plan, proposed by Irving Fisher And other prominent economists, it is actually proven that a full reserved banking system would dramatically reduce government and private debt, eliminate bank runs and provide a more stable economy. The IMF actually showed the it would produce a growth in output of about 10%.

1) Its a proxy, by increase volume implies larger use of bitcoin. i.e. Instead of putting your funds in a bank its on bitcoin. Bank has less deposits to issue loans and hence reduces the money supply.
2) your deposits on bitcoin addresses are full reserves. Its not like you read 5 btc available in your address/wallet but really theres like 0.5 and the rest is lent to someone else.
3) you are right, however it was just a counter argument to people that say that deflation always implies depression.
4) cant argue with that haha
5) betas are the coefficients of each variable, i.e. The actual effects they have on the money supply. Epsilon is just the error term of the model.
6) you are right, if we run this in 4-5 years we might have a totally different result.

Really good term paper. I just want to point out that R^2 just tells you if the regression accurately describes the data or not, however, it does not tell you if the regressors are statistically significant or not. In your paper, you state multiple times that a low R^2 indicates no significance. In order to state that the least you could do is provide F-Test results to inform us of overall significance. Also, another thing you missed is that given the fact that all your data is from time series financial indexes, they may suffer from serial correlation. A simple Durbin-Watson test would let you know if there is serial correlation.

Their business model makes sense when you read the white paper. ICO underwriting will grow as a service in the future. If they have a liquid exchange then they would be the perfect ICO underwriters. They could list ICO tokens on their exchange. Incentivizing ICOs to use them as their underwriters. They also have working version. Not scammy in my opinion. The cons in my opinion are lack of clarifying how they are dealing with AML regulations applying to them. They dont say anything about deposits and withdrawals in Fiat. Or how much they will charge for them. They should talk more clearly about what banks they have lined up to process fiat deposits and withdrawals and to what countries.
