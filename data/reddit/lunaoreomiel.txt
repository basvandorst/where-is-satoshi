A new kitchen is perhaps the dumbest thing to do with it right now.

This is a reddit wide problem. Reddit has gone ban and censorship crazy. I can understand flagging problem users (grayed text, naughty icon on comments), but bans and censorship are no gos for me. Freedom of speech includes trolls, but the benefit of that freedom is greater than their annoyance.

Not disagreeing, but crypto as capital gains is a poor way to tax it. Its a hybrid, new novel tool, it needs updated policy; for example, treat sub 1k transactions as cash (no capital gains) and larger totals as capital gains. The red tape involved in handling taxes on your gains when spending $1 on a coffee is both ridiculous and setting back development of the new tech sector. Its shooting itself in the foot, other countries with more reasonable policy will dominate the industry instead.

That is actually their point, but directed at you. Beyond the whole "theft" arguement, resources are better managed and respected when done so in a bottom up, personally invested in direct results level. Its more efficient and less prone to corruption.

You where fortunate to buy in before thr bubble inflated (cheap loans do that) and to sell before it pops. There are plenty of people who bought high and sold or lost low before.. as there will be again.

Ya and some accent what they have, others hide it or fake it. Big difference. One is definitely more attractive.

Ill take it one further.. buy land and build on it yourself, like a real man. (Kidding, not kidding).

Thats been the normal for decades. Want to see the world economy? Argentina is the beta test.

mmm... I think maybe compared to Europe and Asia, but its NOTHING like how Latin America mistrusts it, its on a whole OTHER level compared to the USA.

Horses are a lot more predictable than the internal combustion engine.

You just proved my point. Cars are now super reliable, because we are at the tail end of decades of maturity on the tech, its a miracle how they are engineered. You take that for granted. Go back in time, where rubber compounds sucked, drum brakes sucked, metallurgy sucked, you had to manually crank the engine over (with risk of broken arms), zero safety, on and on.. those early cars where incredibly risky affairs.. but look at where we are now. Likewise, the same way cars matured, the same way email and the internet and smart phones etc mature, so will blockchain tech and its markets, things are still in their infancy.

Sloppy gramar, likely from a foreign speaker, is totally understandable if the content, the ideas are sound. While it be nice to see the is dotted and the ts crossed, dont be a square.

In emergence, individual actions in a system lead to a bottom up structure and concenscious. Schooling fish and flocking birds have no conductor, yet their form and behaviour is quite complex with only very basic choices in the bottom.  The "rules" are either enforced by the individuals in the network/flock/reef/whateves or by the network itself in a meta way. If you want to read more:

Forgiving debt is bullshit. Plenty of prople suffered to stay debt free, they should not bail out those who didnt. Let all bankrupt systems fail. Thats the only way this shit doesnt happen again.

Not "received", "protected". We are all born the same way into the earth. Its what happens afterwards which unfortunately, leads to so much violence
