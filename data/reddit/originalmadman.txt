This issue is still FAR from resolved. Bot you and support has been contacted and no fucking update since 9th with same canned answers. You guys still owe me 1000 Euro!
@_date: 2014-10-08 21:49:06
Confirmed (nice response time)

2x1000 Euro SEPA transfers I made in early september, supposedly sent and "lost" with the same bullshit excuses for months delay. I canceled them both in november tired of waiting, but only one I got refund for - and  then "we have sent the other one", but no money in my account and no feedback. Conversation is over a dozen replies on the ticket and I can't seem to get the money paid out or refunded into Gox so I can get bitcoins.
Last I heard was the same canned response:
James Support, Nov 30 13:40 (JST):
Dear [],
Sorry for the delay in response. We have forwarded to our banking department to check on this and yet to get update regarding this.
Best regards,
Mt.Gox Team

Yes, doesn't work in incognito either. But i figured what it was:
You're trying to set an offsite cookie for s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com and twitter tracking in addition to the thegrid.io cookie, and of course my browser(s) are set not to allow that. I get to the signup page immediately if I allow the amazonaws cookie... grrr...
You should really see to it that the signup process is not interrupted for regular cookie blocking behaviour (which is a standard setting, not a plugin!) or at the very least a graceful error. You may loose a significant portion of signups if you don't fix this.
Also, you should consider paying me consultant fees now :)

I think he changed it to avoid being linked to his dad, Jason...

Signup seems broken too now (in IE and Chrome), just rotating icon until I get bored and try again (tried since  its 280+ now though)... 4 browsers, 2 computers, same crap. Seems to work in Firefox.
This + Chrome display issues = is not going so well (for them or for me).
EDIT: Finally got it to work! If you're gonna sign up, first three people consider doing me a favor and use my referral: HTTPS://THEGRID.IO/ (since it only makes sense for first three, post answer here if you did).

Great, do I get a discount? :D
1+ minute (several) waiting time several times for both vanilla IE and Chrome + adblock &amp; various anti-tracking extensions (all latest versions). Did load fast in Firefox though. I'm on home fiber so connection is not an issue. I still have the same issue in both browsers, and it does not seem to go away.

Thanks buddy ;)

I guess that can be true depending on your valuation of "honest" and how you mean it in this sense. It is not like the ledger can lie. Good point nonetheless.
@_date: 2014-01-05 00:18:53
Yep sending as PM

It's gonna be metric vs imperial once again. The rest of the world moves on with a better system while good 'ole US of A (and Liberia) refuse to change and sticks with the old...

Yup, included in "no one can cheat or lie"

Peanut money, won't even buy you a car - much less a house you can even live in. Not rich

The actual average queue seems to be near infinite - even for SEPA. I have yet to hear anyone get any SEPA transfers out that were placed after summer.
@_date: 2013-11-28 23:25:34
I can second that, 12 weeks waiting for two SEPA transfers now and money has been "processed" on one but never arrived - and now support are ignoring me. At least the other I could cancel and get out in btc. What a bunch of crap :(

Yes agreed, so we need to do our checking.
KNCminer does not seem to be a registered company under its own name in Sweden (nothing wrong with that at the moment).
I had a look into what is behind kncminer, looking at the phone number listed (did not try to call). It is owned by a one man taxi company, that has been in business since 2010-11-09. This is the only business the owner is involved in, and it seems it's 2011 year was alright (2012 not yet available).
I think this is his facebook page:
If you wanna do his credit history, shady business from before should show up in some cheap checking, for instance here (I couldn't find any historical "issues" elsewhere)
The company actually building it is a small tech outfit in central Stockholm:
All in all, not an instant turn-off - but it is a very small one man outfit (unless there are some hidden partners) working in partnership with a small tech-savvy company (that by all means seem very legit).
I don't think it is a scam (I have now pre-ordered - it doesn't cost money yet), but we need to be wary ofc.
I hope this helps someone.

...if you pay for it. I heard that it is a fairly "voluntary" practice on that side of the world.

1) Send dirty coins to new address at exhange (preferably outside country). 2) Sell dirty coins. 3) With the fiat, buy new coins which are now clean. 4) Send clean coins home to NEW wallet. Done!
@_date: 2013-08-27 10:00:19
great, you just ruined the market :(
@_date: 2013-04-24 00:49:32
Strangely, i think that is the old owner of the phone number. It is still listed everywhere on him though. It may currently not be listed. Disregard previous message.

I have been waiting since sept 5th for a minor SEPA withdrawal (9+ weeks). It was supposedly "confirmed" 10 days ago for transfer. Still no money in bank account. And SEPA is supposed to take 1-3 days max.
I have been in touch 5+ times with their helpdesk. Same generic crap answers every time...

The gap has narrowed since it became more accessible to deposit funds. In addition to less buy pressure, and a being a lower volume exchange, their exchange rate and fee (1%) is not as good as bitstamp (for most people). e.g. cost is higher to deposit in btc-e than bitstamp for most people, and certainly for Europeans using SEPA transfers. Bitstamp is also surprisingly fast in processing incoming money and have superb rates for the (mandatory) EUR-&gt;USD conversion. I expect the gap of 1-3 USD to remain for a while, since it is small enough not to warrant any real arbitrage.
