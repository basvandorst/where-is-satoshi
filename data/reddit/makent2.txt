Hey, I saw your post and wanted to see what you ended up doing here.  I just recently setup a solo401K and am still in process of setting up my LLC to actually set up Exchange accounts to start trading.  Unfortunately, I decided to do this right at a crazy time and am a bit unsure about how it's going to pan out right now (crazy time meaning right before the holidays as well as the expected delays I'm sure I'll encounter as I try and setup a business/Trust account on multiple exchanges to actually start trading).  
Would love to hear about your or anyone else's recent experiences here...  Thanks...

Solera Bank in CO. It was recommended by the Co that I used (Nabers) to setup the s401K.  Low fees and pretty easy to open and work with so far but still kinda early days. Let me know if u have any other ?s

FYI - I'm in process of setting up my bank account now as part of my solo 401(k).  I was thinking about using Wells but have found another one that was recommended as part of the package I used to set up the s401k.  I was wondering for those that set up an account at Wells what the fees were like there?  That's my primary personal bank but figured the fees would be a killer there.  
The bank I applied with offers the following:
 - waived mos service fees
 - no mini balance
 - work a lot with SD accounts
 - online access 
 - ability to send wires online (1st wire free), free cashier's checks, free checks, mobile deposits, ACH transfers to/from other banks
Was wondering if Wells offered all of those capabilities and if so, what are the fees like?  Thanks...  would love to hear back from those using Wells..
