Well yeah for now IOTA is kind of in a slowdown and basically not too useful. It finds its use when handling an enormous amount of micro transactions:)

Well in my humble opinion they don’t have the same proposition at all, so I could not say one is better as a whole than the other.
Bitcoin has a proven track record, while iota is pretty new and they are pretty much in beta testing right now with a centralized validation network.
Iota aims to create a solution for a future where micro transactions are made between home appliances that communicate and transfer money between themselves and rely on large companies to take on the “burden” of confirming the transaction on a voluntary basis.
Bitcoin aimes to be a store of value (as of now without segwit2x), where transactions are made between individuals. The core idea of bitcoin is a decentralized currency, which is achieved by the mining’s décentralisation.
So it’s pretty much two concepts that are trying to achieve something different and try to be the best at the task they set forward to achieve! 
Hope this helps!

Thank you mate!

What makes you say that? What is the logical reason to say that?
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:58:22
Why would you say that the B2X is gone? Appart from the fact that the price of the future 8 days before the implementation is lower than BTC's price doesn't mean much. If you look at signalling from the miners, there is a pretty big support for B2X.. 
Why is that? I don't get this.

Thank you mate!

Ok but why not go with BCH then?
@_date: 2017-11-17 10:34:25
Thank you mate!

Innocent question, but why are you against Segwit2x's change to BTC protocol? Why 'protect' the old BTC, instead of moving on?
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:58:32
Don't worry, you'll get it for Christmas! ;)
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:28:35
Yes it's going to happen as there is no consensus, but how can you find out who will be come out as a winner? Something like 85% of miners signalled that they will mine S2X, and a lot of word is thrown around BCH too. Why would BTC be the winner?

But most of the nodes signalled that they will support both options for miners no?
@_date: 2017-11-08 10:53:27
Yes, sorry about that, but miners make the decision in the end right?
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:57:46
Ok I understand that but go in coin.dance and see for yourself that the percentage of blocks marked as NYA is pretty high. So what facts are out there to show that it will fail?
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:57:48
He's da man!

Same shit here! BitStamp what's going on? ...
