wrong subreddit

I believe that cryptocurrency is superior to legacy banking, and it has the potential to improve the world. By "world" I specifically mean those who aren't obscenely wealthy.   
You are accusing me of acting selfishly. I try, on a day to day basis, constantly, to act altruistically. I am not convinced that giving the IRS money is altruistic. I'd much rather contribute to a global food bank, or R&amp;D for cheap energy.    
I don't mind paying sales taxes or giving a w-2 to an accountant, because both are easy. I am NOT going to spend my time accounting for the activity between my pool and my wallet, because I value my time more than money.    
You accuse me of thinking about myself. What is your vision for the future? Perfectly taxed plebeians?

Other-me says go all in on cryptocurrency, because it's as disruptive as fuck, and YOLO motherfucker.    
Other-me gets me in trouble (...but is also why I'm retired at 29 :D )

...i'm guessing the balance just shows up in your google wallet...

I think it's a mistake to encourage small businesses to accept cryptocurrency.    
Simply *asking* if a business accepts is a non-culty way of encouragement. If you are pushing, it'll be off-putting.

yeah, that's gonna happen /s    
Don't waste your time

I'm heavily invested in bitcoin, but, to be devil's advocate: gmail is faster and cheaper. No fees and Instant delivery/spendability in USD (obviously this only is the case for US users)(USers? :) )

"invested".    
Did you learn a lesson here?
@_date: 2014-05-22 07:17:51

there is no way I'm going to keep track of every payment from my pool (multiple per day), and the momentary exchange rate at the time of each payment (according to which exchange? Which rate is authoritative??), and the exchange rate of each particular amount of BTC when/if I convert to USD. It's not going to happen.    
I don't mind paying taxes, but I'll need a simpler way to do so. Otherwise, I'll just keep my wealth in crypto and pm, and only "cash" out enough to pay bills. I'll always be poor to the IRS lol

my last no-fee transaction took more than 24hrs to confirm. I see the huge potential of cryptocurrency and I support bitcoin. I also try to keep away from fanaticism. Objectively, this is competitive technology.    
    
EDIT: it would also be WAY easy to email my mom some money with google wallet. She zones out as soon as i start talking about bitcoin addresses or qr codes. though, in fairness, she composed her emails with telegram syntax until a few years ago (i was born to old parents :) )
