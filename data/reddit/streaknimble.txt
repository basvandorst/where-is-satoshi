Yes. They want Google to buy them. Buy a bunch of ads, get a bunch of users on the platform. Instantly more valuable. This is a VERY common tactic of startups.

That sure is playing a LONG game for sure based on user data

State facts. Be downvoted.
He is right, the site blows.
Not trolling either and I highly doubt he was either. The site sucks and someone needs to tell them that.
And also correct. Don't say breaking news. It is very clearly in the rules.
Or you could send the staff of your event to downvote shit you don't agree with. That works as well.

Just read second link. Oops.

Who are the writers at Coin Fire blowing that they keep breaking stories before everyone else? 1-800-Flowers like more than two weeks before, then the XAPO statement before even XAPO, the auction stuff. How the heck?
How long until Coin Desk, CCN and others cover this?

This is a common startup tactic. Trying to show the people you want to buy you that you kick ass? Buy a shitload of ads on the platform and build a bunch of users quickly.
Google doesn't own Twitch. Every person upvoting this clearly doesn't click in to see that this is false. Don't blindly upvote shit people.
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:25:02
Thank you Coin Fire for always fact-checking shit before you run it unlike some other sites.

@_date: 2014-08-03 16:36:09
Name them.
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:38:15
Where did you get he posted about that previous post in first person from that?
I get - I have reached out to Matonis about this and he has ignored me three times.
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:38:54
Until they see all of this drama and freak the fuck out and decide to just sit on it as well.
@_date: 2014-08-13 15:29:30
Go fuck yourself.
@_date: 2014-08-13 15:31:17
The fact this comment has so many upvotes when you can easily visit the site and see they posted the actual javascript so you could self-host is truly telling that most people are idiots and don't actually click in to read something.
EDIT: I see that wasn't the case initially, even still comment remains because they did the right thing but no one seems to give a flying fuck.

No. I think Vitalk dumping all of his new BTC coins started a panic sale. 
@_date: 2014-10-21 18:34:29
Funny site!
@_date: 2014-10-21 18:36:23
The guy needs to get a life.
@_date: 2014-08-03 02:28:32
Are you guys going to report on his vanishing then or is this more of a good riddance sort of thing since he smeared your site?
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:39:26
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:29:55
I am suspect at the moment. Clicked in to the link and see it claims a report in Russia stated this but failed to name the report or link to it.
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:43:34
Umm.... outside of the fact those documents are clearly online. Just searched. Found in like twenty seconds.
@_date: 2014-08-08 18:29:25
I hope more actually do the same. I see this was downvoted to all hell. Not sure why. I have my guesses about other sites interfering because I would like to think our community would support someone doing something awesome but perhaps I am wrong.
@_date: 2014-08-18 20:07:25
Cool idea! Going to check this out for sure.
@_date: 2014-10-21 18:33:41
That site licks balls.
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:31:16
You are right, didn't even notice that on the first pass. Downvoting this coinfinance linkbait bullshit.
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:42:33
Exactly. One look at this and even if they aren't involved with the community they will run for the hills out of fear they will be murdered, or everyone won't believe them and start a witch hunt.
@_date: 2015-01-03 06:16:41
Are you effing serious? Stop promoting sites that promote the scam Paycoin. Jesus.
@_date: 2015-01-07 04:52:14
No, you didn't prove anything. A quick search of the Internet Archive shows that Scott Fargo did pump and that CCN has edited things.
That alone discredits whatever else you are going to say.
Not to mention a quick search does show this Tom guy has been breaking corruption in this industry for a long time.
Please show us something you've exposed besides yourself to be a shill for GAW.
Perhaps once you've exposed a major industry fraud, shown people which news sites are scamming them, and exposed a gambling operation buying off a major organization in the cryptocurrency world you'll seem more credible.
For now you are simply a shill. You haven't shown anything to be incorrect and Tom has delivered and been correct COUNTLESS times in the past.
@_date: 2015-01-03 06:04:19
GoCoin is next.
@_date: 2015-01-02 18:47:54
No, this is bullshit. I respected you until today. This is the most obvious scam I have seen to date.

Good work on asking them for the removal. Let us know how it turns out please.
