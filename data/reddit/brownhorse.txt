Not sure if I'd consider paying a $25 adoption fee "buying" it.
Edit: I can see how cashing out BTC to pay for food/vet/ other expenses for the life of the dog would make sense.

Are you able to export them? from inside the wallet you should be able to export private keys, likely with a passphrase. Then from there you can copy the addresses and look them up on the blockexplorer to see if they have any balances. Or just open up a new wallet on electrum, when starting the new wallet, click restore/import private keys, and paste the private keys into the wallet. It should sync up much faster than the full node.

Dude, this is so fucking awesome. Bitcoin has also changed my life, enough to take care of my student loans and give me a bit of an emergency fund. I've always imagined if I hit some significant windfall in my life I would try and do bigger and better things with the money than just spend frivolously on myself. You are truly an inspiration and I hope your selfless giving inspires others to do the same. 
I don't really have anything to contribute right now but I just wanted to say thanks for what you're doing. I've raised money for JDRF in the past and know many people with T1D and feel it is often overlooked because it is not as "serious" of a condition. I don't think they accept bitcoin donations but just bringing it up in case you're interested. 
Again, this is fucking awesome, thanks!

It's alternative coin. Not altcoin. Since when did the word alternative give permission to be shortened to alt?? Outrage.

I sent .5 two days ago with a fee of about 4 cents and it confirmed in 2 hours. You only need high fees if you want instant confirmation

You would be surprised the amount of new buyers bitcoin has been attracting with this price surge.

I was in in 2011, kept my coins on gox and spent them regularly on the original silk road. Lost money on gox, lost money on dark net siezures and exit scams too. Continued buying and spending as soon as i got them. Forgot about BTC for a few years and then realized i still had a few on some other random exchange (btc-e) and got them back just a few months ago. Transferred about half of them to a paper wallet and left the rest to trade for other cryptos for fun. Now here i am with about 3 BTC in a paper wallet and 3BTC worth of ether, LTC and dash lost to another exchange shutdown. 
Long story short there was a time when i held over 50 BTC and have probably traded a few hundred over the years, yet here i sit with only a few left. Id say most earlier adopters made similar mistakes and took a lot of losses in order to understand the importance of hodling. Keep hodling and weather the storms.

Hits waaaaay too close to home.

What a load of shit, I'm just gonna hodl then and see what happens later on with the two chains. Hopefully everything will revert back to normal and I can just pretend this never happened.

So I painlessly sold my BCH last fork by sending my BTC to a new wallet first, then transferred my BCH to an exchange using the original private key with a BCH wallet.
With 2X is there a different protocol for this? If I wait a few days after fork, send my BTC to another new wallet, can I use the old wallet's private key to access 2X coins or will they have disappeared?

Big shoutout to the OG silk road. Its the only reason I ever heard about Bitcoin back in the day. I'm sure a lot of people are in the same boat
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:00:57
lol same, how bout that BCH pump tho
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:52:52
I invested in bitcoin to buy a lot of coffee down the road

Bitcoin must really be blowing up if this meme is unknown around here
@_date: 2017-09-19 02:50:45
He didn't receive $800 though, probably like .2BTC. That puts it into perspective a bit more. I remember people tipping .1 on reddit back in the day. Throw that shit into a dicing website, turn it into a quick 1.5 and then lose it all like a real BTC OG.
I look back at my old bets of .5-1btc on random Japanese ping pong tournaments cause they had ridiculous odds like +1500 and shit. If it's free have fun with it. Unless he's broke then  pay your rent first

Not if they didn't come from the same $1 piece and are fuzed back together

I immediately spent it on about a gram of MDMA, felt fucking great.

This is gentleman, hodl your bitcorns
@_date: 2017-09-01 17:52:54
Exactly, Originally BTC was only around 10% of what I invested. when it hit 50% I traded half of it for alts like litecoin, dash and ether. Now crypto is about 80% of my portfolio and my alts have overtaken BTC + BCH.
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:09:47
You must've misunderstood. The wex tokens are not crypto. They are representatives of the cryptos we held in our accounts when the FBI seized the website. They turned 31% of our crypto balances into their tokens to make up for the seized money. We cannot withdraw tokens, only sell for a fraction of their representative crypto and then withdraw that. I am not okay with selling at 40% value and then withdrawing those BTC into my personal wallet, which means in the meantime I'm missing out on any potential forks that wex does not honor.

Eh, not everyone. Most of us still have a significant portion of our trading funds in their tokens. I'm not cashing out my BTC tokens at 40% value. So while we wait for the tokens to reach 1:1 we will miss out on any potential fork coins.

CPU mining...
@_date: 2017-09-19 03:05:22
Same, currently have a measly 10% of what I once owned, completely by accident.
 Thought I had spent them all on SR1&amp;2 and a bit on agora, but then logged back into my campbx account when the price passed the gox ATH to see I had forgotten about some and then hodled since. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:13:45
what if I deposited my own BTC into the website, traded for ether and litecoin. None of this could have possibly been stolen from gox. I had been hodling those coins for years before making a switch.
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:15:03
how would any of this relate to dash, ltc, or ether in any way possible? what claims could gox have on any alt coin that didnt even exist during the hack
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:05:09
Yeah, I had recently traded in about .5 BTC (from coinbase) to BTCe for 3 equal parts dash, ether and LTC. Was working on getting them out into separate wallets when the site went down. So I'm to assume if they ever do come back up, at best, part of my holdings will get absorbed into the fine they have to pay.

Well I'm still up from Tuesday, if that really counts..? Keep it goin
