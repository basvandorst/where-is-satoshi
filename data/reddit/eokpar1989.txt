Government is so stupid that it thinks it can ban peer to peer software

Massive waste of resources.

Thanks to Silk Road. Those early adopters are the luckiest people on earth.

Yea, lots of people use offshore banks to do business. Thats not the problem. How do all these bums get so much fucking money when they have never worked a fucking job in their entire life? The Africans are the worse. 
People are starving in Nigeria and this shit stain can only think to enrich himself.

Its not a criminal enterprise.

Nope, this charge was money laundering. The other was running a money transferring business without a government license. Nice try though.

When I was reading the criminal complaint against Ulbricht, I was struck that the VPN he had used after connecting to the library wifi turned over the IP address within a second of being asked by the government. Is this normal? I use PIA and they assure me they don't keep logs.

Utter lies. ULBRICHT WAS AN IDIOT. He kept all of the Silk Road's bitcoins and his bitcoin on his personal computer with the keys encrypted in a folder that's title was "keys". There were no threats needed because he was such a bumbling idiot.

Don't believe the 6 BILLION DOLLAR BS. The government always inflates these things. You think he was transferring a billion dollars a year? Really? Did you believe the government that Silk Road did a billion dollars in transactions when it really did $35 million?

Dude, he had no chance at a fair trial. They seized all of his cash and, thus, he had ONE attorney. One attorney to go through 52 TB of data on his servers. He had no chance of fair trial. People plead guilty because the government makes the punishment 10x worse when you lose at trial. The federal court is the worse because the laws are very vague and the entire system is set up by the feds to prevent you from defending yourself. The federal court is a joke.

Without question prosecuted by the government of the USA.

The other SWIFT "hacks" weren't hacks at all. They were inside jobs. The Bangledeshi bank's SWIFT terminal was used after working hours, not hacked. Money was sent to banks in the Philippines. The bank was told to return the funds and they still allowed people to withdraw the funds in cash! Why? Because the bank manager was scared for her life. This one is also an inside job probably.

Great background on liberty reserve.

If you run a VPN and then use Tor would you be safe?

The earlier charge that he had plead guilty to schmuck was OPERATING A MONEY TRANSMITTING BUSINESS WITHOUT A LICENSE. The charge he is being sentenced to now is MONEY LAUNDERING.
