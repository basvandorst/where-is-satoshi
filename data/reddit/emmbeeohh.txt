As always, everyone has their own moon. Just don't ever sell all your coins. Being debt free is as good a reason as any to decide to sell so if in the future you feel regrets for not holding longer, just remind yourself that at the time you made what felt like the smartest and safest option to yourself

I bought 6 LTC when they were ~$35, funny thing is I don't even remember why I bought them. Hodl it is
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:01:04
Or expect a big crash like in the past, back to four figures. At least that's what I'm hopeful of so I can try to get at least 1 full BTC lol

Uhhh...that's not a big deal, especially since she asked him to do her a favour. Buying him a coffee that costs a few dollars while in a café because she asked him to help her buy something that may potentially make her big returns is a pretty small token of appreciation

Have you ever been there?

If it was possible to go back in time most of us would probably buy a shit load of BTC, and other Cryptos, but say if you bought like 250k BTC would such an amount really effect the way BTC has grown to today?

I lived in Kyiv for a while. I found it really safe and welcoming and there are many very wealthy people living there with no issues. If someone wanted security I'm sure they could hire it no problem. I'd feel less safe in many parts of the US being so public about BTC holdings

Did you go back to college to study or taught yourself? How long have you been working on upskilling? 
@_date: 2019-03-11 02:13:53
That's great, you sound motivated and disciplined so I don't doubt that as a possibility in the future, hope you keep it up and achieve it!
@_date: 2019-03-11 02:23:14
Their ego takes importance over their long-term safety and success... because people like this are fucking dumbasses who just want to be feel cool
@_date: 2018-06-11 20:35:57
Ah that's not too bad, don't feel too bad over it! Plus you probably wouldn't have held long enough anyway
...but don't ever check. Never fucking do it to yourself lmao
@_date: 2018-06-11 20:27:03
How many would you have owned
@_date: 2018-06-11 20:20:57
That's a good way to look at it and I hope something catches your attention that helps you succeed

"some have been asking for ETH instead"
That's interesting, were they aware of Ethereum beforehand?
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:38:47
Since you're using gdax why not just setup buy orders for your ideal ranges?
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:08:42
There's definitely great profit to be made from trading but I just can't deal with the stress and obsession that would cause me, I already check the prices and news often most days but mostly just when I'm bored at work. Much healthier to just hold long-term and really keep an eye out for new coins worth considering
@_date: 2018-03-19 16:55:14
"We have to start somewhere"
Many people don't seem to understand this basic thing, some people I've talked about CCs with just say shit like "well why can't I walk into a shop right now and pay using any CCs?" as if every business should be equipped to accept CC transactions overnight. Fucking eejits. There are still shops that don't even accept cards
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:46:53
So you're all in in monero? What was the deciding factor in you doing that?
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:53:17
Just wish this would hurry up and be over and done with soon so we can get on with things in a healthy way rather than feeling this looming over us. Is there any genuine timeframe this is expected to happen?
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:04:30
Even before this site I enjoyed seeing what could've been (billions lol) because I think it's interesting to think about just how far you would take it if you could travel back in time with all the information you have now and the implications it could cause on the actual market itself. Like let's say you go back and accumulate 1M bitcoin - how would this impact the current days market when the time comes? Would the price have reached this level or would it be lower? If it was higher, what would your life even be like 'today' after going from being a completely normal, random person to a multi billionaire in less than a decade because you bought what many people consider to just be some internet coins? It would get even more ridiculous if you bought up all the best performing alt coins along the way.
I like to think that I'd be satisfied with a few billion and wouldn't keep chasing after more and more but instead invest it traditionally to get decent dividends each year that I would then use to dedicate my time to charitable causes but also really helping my home city and countrymen. Doing random crazy shit like stopping a total stranger in the street and handing them a few thousand would be a daily occurrence
@_date: 2018-02-17 00:57:48
Big if true
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:21:11
What made you buy in back in December? You put in a decent amount so surely you did your research on what you were buying and considered how long you would hold and the possible, or actually inevitable, crashes during that time?
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:24:48
Haha you did that?
@_date: 2018-02-04 13:16:52
When do you think that will that be?
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:27:40
Just sarcastically say "okay, thanks for your opinion" and carry on talking about it with your friend and other people capable of actually having a discussion. If you're bothered you could take note of the memes and shit he's positing and show him how stupid he was down the line when you make your profits
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:07:34
Well, either you believe this shit is going to succeed in the long-term and buy with confidence based on that and then continue on with your daily life or you don't and you spend time anxiously obsessing over the price recovering and allow it to interfere with your daily life
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:41:33
This will sound completely retarded I'm sure because it goes against all investing advice and strategies since obviously the end goal for us is to get decent returns, but the moment I hit buy I basically 'forget' that money. Just as I would 'forget' the money I spend on a drink in a shop or a meal in a restaurant. It stays in the back of my mind that I now own an 'asset' of course and it's exciting when the value shoots up but since I'm not really worried as I've only put in what I'm willing to lose it's actually even a bit enjoyable to observe the dips and crashes and consider whether or not I will buy more.
It's all speculation and I've just accepted the likely situation that I'll get burned at some point but at the same time you do your research and come to a decision and put your hard earned money in for a reason. I'm mostly in on ETH because from what I've learned about it it's more likely to have successful uses as a technology and when there are dips I just remind myself of this and it helps stay calm. Other than that, I've always had the attitude that I'm holding for 3-5+ years anyway and it's inevitable that there'll be large drops in the value during this time but if it all works out and the tech turns out to be as promising as it seems, this patience will pay off big time.
The most annoying thing about crashes is the amount of armchair experts that come out and condescendingly say "Ha! The bubble has burst, I told you so - bitcoin is a scam all along" until a few weeks or months later there's a new ATH and they revert back to shutting the fuck up or passively talking about the inevitable crash again. If you ask these same types to name a few other cryptocurrencies they likely won't be able to, let alone say what their different uses and strengths are so I find this a good tactic to use to decipher genuine critics from fools that just feel their opinion matters just because this involves money.

A colleague of mine, a woman in her forties, randomly asked me if I was into cryptocurrencies recently. I was surprised but she explained that on her revolut account there was an option to buy them and she was curious because her teenage son had talked about wanting to start mining them. It seems to be cheaper to buy using them than coinbase at least so that's a positive, but the main thing is that it's bringing awareness to the masses. Even if people simply see the term cryptocurrency it'll register in their minds and during the next bull run they'll be more likely to pay attention

Look into dollar cost averaging if investing a large sum seems too daunting to you
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:53:22
I say this as someone who's mostly in on ETH and fully believes it deserves to be  especially since I own more of it than any other cc; I would never count BTC out. Multiple times BTC has 'died' and for months everyone would talk about it like it was never coming back, and then it seems to claw its way back, working its way to a slow jog and eventually a sprint until suddenly it's blowing past previous ATHs and the media hype brings in a new round of investors. It may not make sense to us because we see the advantages and disadvantages of each, but that's just the way it is with cryptucurrencies
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:08:05
You haven't already lol?
@_date: 2018-02-04 13:22:19
It most likely will at some point though?...
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:48:14
So we can do the exact fucking opposite

This and then please get the fuck away from any sub related to this
@_date: 2018-02-10 13:45:43
I think the simpletons that can't use 'woman' and 'women' correctly are far worse, but yeah this is ridiculous that we have adults making such elementary school level mistakes
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:45:46
Can you use USD also when referencing the value, it makes it easier because the majority of discussion involving fiat values is in USD
@_date: 2018-02-10 13:38:38
"sold five bitcoin"
I like how you say this so nonchalantly, if I had even just 1 whole BTC I'd be so thrilled lol
@_date: 2018-02-04 14:03:45
Interesting. You base this off what? Can you show us anything which you calculated that with? Preferably a chart with a dinosaur
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:34:32
When it comes to cryptocurrencies just stick to referring to everything in USD and then simply do a quick currency exchange yourself. I'm from Ireland, where we use EUR, and do this because it's just easier for all of us to basically stick to one fiat currency
@_date: 2018-04-12 22:33:35
But in a few years, provided they hold, they may be very glad they were

Yup lol
