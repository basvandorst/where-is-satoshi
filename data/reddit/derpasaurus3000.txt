It's amazing how many people on this sub believe that.
@_date: 2016-08-02 04:31:42
I would say that it has more to do with the Core/Chinese miner meeting.
@_date: 2016-08-06 14:59:26
Damn what a burn.
@_date: 2017-02-08 06:48:53
Bitcoin had a multi year bear market (so holding till the moon seemed pointless) and many people aren't Bitcoin maximalists. 
@_date: 2017-02-23 13:50:42
Bitcoin unaffected.
@_date: 2017-02-09 04:36:44
That was before China's volume was revealed to be bullocks. 
@_date: 2017-02-10 02:15:58
Why haven't others pushed mBTC more? 
@_date: 2017-02-08 08:48:30
Just think of it as a flash sale.
@_date: 2017-02-25 15:47:09
Bitcoin was in a 3 year bear market so I don't blame you for taking those actions. I say this as a serial hodler :)
@_date: 2017-02-20 18:04:54
I know you'll get downvoted but Trump not liking Bitcoin would be quite the setback. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 19:16:59
What do you mean the price is too high?
@_date: 2017-02-08 08:17:20
Yeah I looked at the charts 10 minutes ago and was like wtf? A whale probably. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 08:43:13
Yep, definitely not a coincidence especially with that Bloomberg article coming out within minutes (less than 30 minutes) after the drop. It's bullshit that certain players in China have that much power even after the fake volume was exposed.
@_date: 2017-02-09 13:56:32
Support is around $915. I'm waiting for it to plunge there and then buy.
@_date: 2017-02-09 19:53:01
Lel!!! Chinuh got goxxed!!1!1!

How long have you known about Bitcorn?
@_date: 2017-02-08 21:17:01
Usually many people who want to buy Bitcoin are turned off by the price under the false assumption that one needs to buy 1 whole Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-02-24 23:06:26
To be fair, Bitcoin was extremely difficult to acquire pre-2013 for the average Joe.
@_date: 2017-02-15 20:53:56
$1000 for the next 5 years? You're shockingly optimistic for a buttcoiner ;)
@_date: 2017-02-06 01:25:36
Wah? Which one?
@_date: 2017-02-02 03:19:03
Err it's been on a downward trend the past hour.
@_date: 2017-02-08 08:47:29
I was expecting the pboc to announce something soon but not this soon, maybe closer to the Janurary 2017 ATH.
@_date: 2017-02-24 21:51:55
The article and most of the comments are pure cringe. 
@_date: 2017-02-09 15:58:40
true that 
@_date: 2017-02-10 02:09:46
If that's what "we" are up against, bitcoin will moon soon. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 18:30:11
The SEC could be doing so in "good faith". 
@_date: 2017-03-03 06:13:27
This one has the right idea. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 23:49:43
What about BU's claim that Segwit has "technical debt"?
@_date: 2017-03-26 02:31:11
They've been against Andreas for a while.

I thought he liked Lightning Network?
@_date: 2017-03-03 05:42:02
No because the price will most likely recover within a few weeks or months after the ETF rejection. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 13:59:31
Thank you for the clarification. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 15:16:45
It's actually a bug on the page. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 02:39:58
My bad bro.
@_date: 2017-03-04 05:48:24
It's not possible to send bitcoins to a non-existent address. **The probability that a mistyped address is accepted as being valid is 1 in 232, that is, approximately 1 in 4.29 billion.**
@_date: 2017-03-25 17:23:39
I've only seen one Twitter user mention this China FUD.

Bitcoin has had crashes before and been in long bear markets. Nothing new in that department. Also, we've endured XT, Classic, and now BU. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:59:45
There's a contradiction in BU's narrative that 2mb HF will result in cheaper and faster transactions while the same BU promoting miners wouldn't want that.
@_date: 2017-03-25 17:35:13
Andreas believes Moore's Law will eventually bring down mining centralization.
@_date: 2017-03-29 00:55:38
Bitcoiners here pretend as if Trump will just allow remittances to be byassed via Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 17:20:23
Noice. I was going to mention that the longer both sides stall the less likely a HF occurs.
@_date: 2017-03-24 15:10:10
Can't tell if BU shill or joking. Poe's Law in effect.

@_date: 2017-03-20 17:40:26
There are some BU supporters that are so against Core that even if Core had an identical code/roadmap as BU, BU wouldn't signal Segwit. 
@_date: 2017-01-18 05:18:10
Barkchain? dogecoin? 
@_date: 2017-01-14 22:35:53
The ideal situation (besides not paying taxes hurr) is to treat bitcoin as an asset or foreign currency depending on how its used. For example if I traded euros in forex trading its treated like an asset but if I used it to buy goods and services, it will be considered a foreign currency. 
@_date: 2017-01-21 23:46:56
ol these neckbeards. Since something merely existing means nothing lets look at metrics that do matter. Now name one legitimate use case, startup with actual revenue, or any signal of mass adoption after eight years.... crickets. I love how now the goal posts have moved to "well we are still buying and selling tokens from each other"... assuming they aren't stolen or goxed by an exchange in one of the 30 EZ steps along the way. By the same retard logic isn't onecoin a success? What about litecoin?
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:50:31
@_date: 2017-01-18 15:09:18
I predict a big sale coming soon.
@_date: 2017-01-14 22:29:14
You're right, most hodlers using Coinbase are pissed that they have to prove ownership of coins in the first place. It's going to be a hassle for sure. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 19:04:46
That's not a legit coinbase subreddit.
@_date: 2016-06-11 23:04:44
Price volatility, duh. 
@_date: 2017-01-14 20:20:36
lol this
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:59:39
You only pay capital gains if you sell them. No sell = No capital gain/loss. 
@_date: 2016-12-17 03:21:27
Maybe if Coinbase gets hacked.
@_date: 2017-01-02 02:11:23
Wait, lemme get my crystal ball...
@_date: 2016-12-17 03:42:43
Come to think of it, I'm surprised Circle's rage quitting never affected the price. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 05:39:09
Short term: another hack (they're asking for it by keeping coins on an exchange)
Long term: who knows
@_date: 2016-12-29 18:07:24
I blame exchanges like btc-e for that mess. IIRC back in 2012 you had to buy 1 BTC worth in order to trade. It's my opinion that this idea stuck and now we're in this predicament. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 05:18:21
ITS OVER 900!!!!!
@_date: 2016-12-21 03:20:04
You're right, I wasn't so clear on the matter. Regarding the issue at hand the easiest way to slow down adoption is to apply a sales tax to all centralized exchanges. If government wanted to go full tyranny mode they can try to imprison the miners.
@_date: 2016-12-21 02:25:57
Didn't Bitfinex ruin the last great bull run?
@_date: 2016-12-17 19:24:07
I'm going to have an orgasm at $1200.
@_date: 2016-12-16 19:30:06
So you're saying even after transferring to another wallet Circle was able to find out about the RC purchase? Yikes! I guess the folks at r/rcsources will be in for a rude awakening if block chain analyses are that easy to implement.
@_date: 2016-12-21 00:45:50
It's treated as a sale because the IRS can't magically figure out whether the addresses you sent the bitcoins to belong to you. Of course, this assumes you use a centralized exchange and you just have to prove you own those addresses. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 18:10:54
Pretty much anyone who's gotten their info only from mainstream news thinks like this.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:50:47
Why Coinbase? I can see an argument for Bitfinex with the Tether FuD but not Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-04-03 15:59:04
According to Buttcoiners, Satoshi was fine with botnets mining. Whether that's true or not, everything becomes easier once Satoshi isn't treated like a prophet/deity.
@_date: 2018-03-22 21:11:39
So many people exaggerate the length of the last bear market.

This might sound like a stupid question, but when you pay your income taxes from mining/earning, would you then have to pay capital gains taxes if you spend those same bitcoins afterwards?
@_date: 2017-07-19 20:26:09
The only way to be profitable is to have an enormous mining farm with ASICs. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:54:34
Looking at the twitter comments, one guy doesn't realize you can buy less than 1 bitcoin. OMG, will this problem ever be solved? 
@_date: 2017-07-02 14:35:38
Where is "over here"?
@_date: 2016-07-06 20:48:51
Word has it that they track up to 3 transactions.
@_date: 2017-06-28 22:17:08
Coinbase/GDAX will only get stronger when their website won't crash with every drop.
@_date: 2017-06-16 04:11:01
You really think the other side is that large of a minority? 
@_date: 2017-06-19 15:00:17
They were literally in the talks just a few weeks ago about "regulating" tumblers. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 04:07:42
The price may have fallen due to ViaBTC's article.
