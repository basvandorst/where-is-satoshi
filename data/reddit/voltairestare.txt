Will look into the second, tried fire before, was a bit limited. Looks like they have done more work on it now.

I trade, need ins and outs at low fees. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:01:32
They told me to fuck off, closed 5 accounts already
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:49:43
Banks are private companies, they don't have to serve anyone they don't want to.
Not doing anything illegal. In their eyes, maybe immoral (they hate crypto)

My next step. Try the financial center in Dublin
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:59:38
Yea ignore this guy, this is shite. They fixes most their issues with a massive now roll out. Everything else is just customer service. The OP (and this guy) are not telling the full story.

Asked a few barristers here Im mates with, was told thats all window dressing (in Ireland at least) Ombudsman works for the banks. Dont bother. (although I might, getting close to the edge).
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:22:17
No, Im fully verified, been using them for months. The latest transfers trigger additional KYC. Fine we answered it, they didnt like the answers (We sell some coin on local bitcoin). Said to go corporate on the account if we want to continue and they said they would send the money back. Then support just dropped off, no money sent no confirmation that they will etc. its a similar situation up and down @_date: 2017-12-18 10:40:12
Im not a US citizen but I dont think so, once you are KYC'd you can send what you like
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:48:04
They have held vast amounts of money on people (myself included) without returning it now for weeks. For me Im going to be out nearly 30k coming up to Christmas. (Sent on 30th Nov.)
Theres a very quickly growing list of users not getting their money back on . So no, I wont be recommending them.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:21:12
Its hilarious though, thats why I posted it. Sure we all love a crypto beating.
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:11:15
Ah it used to be easy, working the Champs-Élysées but these days theres too many mimers so you end up crowded out.
@_date: 2017-12-18 10:41:54
The panic is because they have half my book and they are crushing my income. Having so much capital locked up for now two weeks is an obvious loss in this market. Its unprofessional and expensive.

3rd commenter on this special : central banks are secretly betting on every futures market in the US. 
Very hard to win a bet against someone who can move the market

If you reach a threshold, pay the releaser

Ah here, fuck off, all the material relating to this software and any software relating to it is available easily so your points are shite. Go fuck yourself
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:48:04
This is a very important point, upvoted. How could this have happened?
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:58:16
Incorrect, its trading cryptographic signatures back and forth. They cant be hacked, if you are holding one and your 'channel' gets hacked, you can always cash it in. The middle man isn't controllable like a bank
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:08:22
Yep, its working now, needed a confirm before it start showing up (only used hitbtc for one other transaction bcash and it came in even when unconfirmed). 
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:59:21
Ah here, your a spa. Im sorry i got caught up chatting to you. I just remembered your name from another thread, bitcoind3. As the other commenter said, your part of the troll army. You are willfully ignoring the technicalities of the software. 
How much do you get paid to work for these clowns? Wheres the job app, I need a new gig. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:24:15
RTFM again, you must have missed something
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:48:02
Well Hitbtc has a deposit screen for it, its giving out addresses. Their announcement says that they would enable it when its ready. Not sure why its not working to be honest. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:00:03
Cool, thanks
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:26:31
Ah come on, thats not how it works. Its no more or less secure than bitcoin. If you, yes, loose your keys to a thief, you can steal what ever is in the channel at that state. But you would have to compromise both ends of the channel, because if you tried to spend on your end of the channel, it could also be closed at the other end with the result you get nothing. This is part of the design. RTFM.
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:41:26
Incorrect again. If the computer goes off, close the channel with the state you hold locally. Why do you keep ignoring that part of the tech?
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:46:43
Well Ive money on Bitstamp and it took 10 seconds to execute and withdraw an order there. Looking at 3 hours on goign now on Kraken... Its crap. Ive people waiting on coins, i cant even tell them the price yet (Ive been trying to literally buy since before the drop and now all the way through it).
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:14:40
God your such pros at this, what am I mean to say to this clown?
READ THE FUCKING MANUAL 
You spa

No your a cunt, youve been pointed out for weeks on lots of subs as a part of this shit slinging campaign. i just forgot to look at your username, armature mistake by me. May get the reddit enhancement suite so I can just peg you fucks off. Thanks for wasting my last half hour you sack.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:34:36
Look Ive been here since 2012. Ive been hearing that line for 2 years now. Its bullshit and evasive. Other exchanges dont suffer form this. They need to use some of the money they have made to re-write the engine. Theyve been talking about ti for 2 years. A little action would be nice.
I dont believe the new customers thing. I use it every day and on a average day this still happens. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:59:59
Thanks, didnt catch that till you said it, even recognize the name. hes been mentioned a few times. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 16:36:47
Why, what was wrong with it, worked well as a listing
EDIT: That other page is not as good at all
