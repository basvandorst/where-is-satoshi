It’s just the change and how they display it on different apps...

Just gotta say, the majority of people in van don’t live in “sweating needle/shit infested tents” but I get what your saying. 
We are no we’re near as bad as sf in terms of col and homelessness (but it’s still bad)
Also unlike sf I don’t get scared walking past a homeless. Sf is a shit hole.

Except it’s most likely not true. 
We are more likely to see $1m btc while usd is comparable to today than $1m btc and hyperinflated usd.  
As soon as people on top (or next gen people on top) realize they can pump and abuse btc to get super rich they will. 
People here like to think it will “replace” fiat, but that just wouldn’t work, some coin will be based on btc reserve like gold in the past and history will repeat itself.

Now do it programmatically at scale

Everyone in this sub is brainwashed (and I’m long btc)
Chances are the vendor your buying btc from had some dbag or fraudsters cause issue. The banks fraud measures then put a restriction on it automatically. 
The fact they said they’d sort t in a couple of days means you aren’t losing your account, and it was obviously not malicious towards bitcoin. 
Does it suck? Yes. 
Is it because of bitcoin? Not really.

It’s all easy to do technically even at scale, but it’s hard to make it work 99.9% of the time for strange outliers
