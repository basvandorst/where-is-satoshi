I'd say there were financial position issues with robocoin if they were suggesting they needed to resell the machine to reimburse their client. Odds are they were undercapitalized to stand behind the product.

Intriguing thought, but I was wondering... could any bitcoin exchange be charged with conspiring to commit money laundering, if their customer's were caught using bitcoins in illegal transactions, and the btc were sourced back to a purchase from a specific exchange?

Obviously Robocoin is another startup that lacks infrastructure, organization, and experience in customer support. All to common in the Bitcoin world you think you are dealing with business professionals, and the reality is... It's a 20 something year old kid that just graduated college and for the first time had enough money to move out of their parents basement, much less have the experience to manage the finances and business decissions of their 1st start up.

I must say, I'm okay with the changes... I may have to become a level 2 user and adapt to the changes, but like all great things there will be growing pains. If this protects the integrity of the exchange, then it will be good for the end user as well. We all know, all to well... this is the wild west and we all must search for the most reputable people to do business with.

I'd like to know what exchange has the most integrity as well, I know they were one of the first to be approved in new york for ethereum. It's still questionable about a companies ethics internally, regardless of who regulates the exchange.
