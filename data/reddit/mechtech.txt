Nope not an investor, just find HODL to be some truly bottom of the barrel funny stuff. I had shale gas back when all of those companies died and it was similarly entertaining, and Apple supplier communities were entertaining as well as people lived and died with every contract.
Granted, if the quote is just about blockchain tech that's sort of a beautiful quote, but if it's about "hodl"ing until value returns to some arbitrary 100b market cap that could come back later tonight, or 10 years, or never, then yeah it's a pretty typical headless chicken investor quote.

People basing their investment strategy on a meme is where I'm getting my laughs. Man, I thought wallstreetbets was funny but this place is truly entertaining.
The people really holding for 10+ years are probably not the ones typing out tweets like this. These are the guys who will probably sell within the next few months/years and basically be the guys that fed everyone else the most.
Look at "real" investment markets and see how badly guys who talk like this in the Yahoo finance forums perform when compared to people who act without emotion and hold for years without saying anything or typing stupid memes.

Sure, but most of the people mindlessly repeating hodl hodl over and over will not be the ones holding for 10 years. Most be out within a few years because it's just a hobby, or play money, or they need the money eventually, or they get scared, or they take profit, etc. That's the problem because that chain of action is one of the worst investment strategies possible.
Sure, if you're actually holding for 10 years more power to you (although it is smarter to hold a mix of promising blockchain technology, not just BTC).

Hooooly shit this is idiotic. Seriously, ludicrously stupid crap.
Past behavior doesn't guarantee future results. The value of bitcoin may or may not stabilize above or below 100 billion dollars (its current market cap), but it's certainly not "the value of a lifetime". It's up in the air what its true value is, especially considering it doesn't have a monopoly on blockchain tech. 10b is just as valid a number as 100b at this current moment. Jumping in when there is blood in the streets is a volatile gamble, nothing more.
And listing off Microsoft/Amazon/etc in the tech bubble, telling people to buy, hahaha, how about pets.com/Flooz/Kozmo, that's more like it.
He's yelling like a church preacher instead of making any logical points. Total crap. Buy a decent econ 101 textbook and you will get 100x more out of it than clown stuff like this, even if you're exclusively applying the knowledge to bitcoin.

So if bitcoin went to 0 and it turned out the algorithms are flawed and the chain has been poisoned for years, and meanwhile the market went down another few percent and lost another 100 billion, the market would be the biggest loser right?

Yes, the format is terrible and it's full of meaningless tangents and misinformation, but sure there's some substance too.
