at least i can hear you now, but without a pop filter the audio is pretty miserable. need a new mic bro :)
again, agree with analysis, more on my thoughts here 
@_date: 2016-08-15 16:03:08
agreed. 
HOW DARE YOU WANT LEGAL ACTION AND REGULATION!?!?!?!?
@_date: 2016-08-14 17:34:43
Exactly. We had their word then and have it now. No different. Until they release audits and security protocols, as well as how the hack occurred, everyone should pull funds off and not look back. Some people forget, there was downtime a few months prior to the hack during the data migration. I was calling for people to leave then. Some did but most didn't. BFX bottom-line was not affected, and not much change occurred as a result AFAIK. It just remained business as usual. This was just one of the many signs over the years that BFX is not capable of running a reliable, secure exchange. 
I've discussed the [past downtime]( and [the relaunch]( in video format. 
Edit: 
Just because this continues to infuriate me. 


Give us a number. Users bailed out the exchange b/c of your own negligence. 


Gotta love the false choice of bankruptcy vs socialized loss. Nice framing and rationalization there. Again, it's not "users' losses", it's BFX losses passed on to the user.

pertains to okc futs
1 contract = ~$100USD
liquidation means the position is closed and collected by the exchange because the price fell below margin call price

I believe the word you're looking for is 'disrupted' and sure, why not. There are always better ways to do things using emerging technologies.

Update: I visited the Credit Union where the ATM is located today to dispute the transaction. They told me because I am not a member of their credit union I would have to involve my actual credit union to dispute the charges. Once the ATM balance is verified and checked I may receive some of my deposit back. This will take about two weeks I'm told.
@_date: 2014-02-12 07:34:30
Withdrawals are just temporarily disabled until the transaction malleability problem is fixed which will probably take less than a week according to the developers.

Small market cap in an illiquid market + whales = easily manipulated. It definitely doesn't take a bank to simultaneously apply enough market pressure on all the exchanges at once to move the price easily. I know of two such groups, one comprised of primarily Asian traders and another based out of London who are known for manipulating price.

I believe one of the db leaks was from BitPay. One of the merchants I signed up with them received the email. He decided not to go through with bitcoin acceptance and has not been involved with any other bitcoin related site.
