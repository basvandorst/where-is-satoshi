Cool. We can go for a centralized ripploff or even better bankster controlled centralized mining scam
They are real fast and cheap.
I'm starting a coin, will be completely centralized mining like bcash, i'll hold most of the coins (like owners of ripploff) so i can manipulate the market.
Anyone in??
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:19:08
I feel ya buddy.
Hang in there, it's a learning experience for all of us.
Your whole nation has been dumbed down into oblivion and programmed to worship money.
The existence of sound leaderless money might fix that in time, but it might not. 
The point is, those in control of money creation have had the power to manipulate everything - including the thoughts we have and the ideas of the things we think we want.
We NEED to remove that power from them.

Coinbase, in the scheme of things is tiny snd irrelevant. 
They are no where near 'the biggest'.
It is an Umercan bankster owned corporation offering bitcoin trading in the country furthest behind in adoption.
The non-umercan exchanges are vastly bigger and they have been batching for a bery long time.

Are you dreaming?
Even if it does go to zero in fiat value, there will still be me and a few hundred thousand others who won't sell for ANY price.
So cannot 'fall'.
If you are in this to enrich yourself is fiat terms, best of luck. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:16:23
Stop expecting corporations to accept bitcoin.
Small places, mom-pop shops, businesses and people in your own home town. Just ask them if they take bitcoin. Most will want to, but don't know how, so set up with wallet, secure their seed, point them in direction of aantonop and there you go, you can spend your bitcoin.
Try not to spend it with people who'll just send it to an exchange to get fiat back - which is what corporations will want to do.
We need to spread bitcoin amongst people. Let the corporations die with the banks.

Yes, but THEY are not batching them like every other exchange, including exchanges that dwarf conbase.

Bcash is the name most commonly used for a centralized, bankster controlled 'crypto currency' deceivingly named bitcoin cash.
In common use, people simply refer to it a bcash to avoid confusion with bitcoin or the other multitudinous bitcoin forks.  
@_date: 2018-01-01 05:58:29
False. People who cashed out were holding bitcoins to increase their fiat net worth. Not HODLing.
Real HODLers will NEVER sell back to fiat at any price. It is about the big picture. For HODLers, bitcoin ends up being either ubiquitous or nothing at all. We are just tired of using THEIR money and the associated problems that creates. 
So HODLERs put their money (in small amounts) into bitcoin, betting it becomes the central world monetary standard by which ALL other currencies get priced, fiat or crypto. And if it don't, well then it don't. They Still will not trade HODL bitcoin back to fiat EVER.
Then there's your spend and replace bitcoin and your trading bitcoin, which you hold, not HODL.

No, I've watched it more than double and watched the obvious bankster cripplof dump a few times now, THAT doesn't make it REAL.
It's still a scam. Just because dumbed down programmed sellouts are being sucked in through their greed by the same people AGAIN doen't mean that it is actually worth something.

@_date: 2018-01-01 06:14:14
It actually means the bitcoin you decide to HODL and NEVER sell back to fiat. 
These are the coins you SPEND if bitcoin becomes the central world standard for monetary value. Most people agree that 0.1 HODLed will be more than enough to have a dignified life and spread some goodness in the world, at that point.
Either that or bitcoin 'goes to zero' and you still don't sell back to fiat - as your personal 'fuck you' to the man as we begin to consider the possibility of 10,000 years of direct slavery in a sold out and rippledoff world.
It is these HODLed bitcoin that creates a floor because there are simply so many that are not available to trade to fiat. That percentage grows daily. 
The value increases,real HODLing proliferated. Eventually only the freshly mined coins still mined by miners who need fiat to pay for fossil fuel energy are available for trade.
At this point bitcoin IS the final arbitrator of monetary value. 
It's the dream

I'm not sure that's accurate. It may be completely centralized, owned by banksters and silly, but it won't disappear even with the drop in price. There's the odd person who actually believed the hype. That'll keep it from disappearing completely.

I'm sorry, but as far as bitcoin goes, your view is far to Americo-centric. Bitcoin is global.
The price increase was not driven by the insignificant volume traded on coinbase. Umerca is still irrelevant to the bitcoin scene.
The adoption is being driven by people outside of Umerca who can see an end to the murder, oppression and surveillance your corrupt gov dishes out. For people worldwide, this is far more important than getting rich in fiat.
There are exchanges out there that add as many new customers a day as coinbase has in total - or even more than the entire population of Umercan bitcoiners.
The problem with coinbase is that they seem to be the most popular fiat onramp in america, they are loud, and owned by banksters. The flooding of the mempool with unbatched transactions and foot dragging on segwit is just lame. They are most likely incompetent.

There comes a point where liquidity dries up because there are only so many bitcoins available for trading.
Most bitcoin are HODLed.
When the price gets low enough that no one wants to sell and all the HODL coins are still not coming into circulation, then the price HAS to go up.
The price is determined by what people are willing to buy and sell for. Those of us not buying or selling are at the mercy of the traders, but we hold most of the coins, so ultimately the HODL wall is decided by us.

Fantastic and not loaded. Congratulations on that. I would have found that difficult.
My only input is the claim that coinbase is the most popular exchange. This is simply not true. As fast as coinbase is growing, so are the others. And coinbase is still quite small with mostly US customers. The US bitcoiner  population is also quite small in comparison to other countries. For example, I would hazard a guess that there's more bitcoin in Iran than the US - from years ago. And Iranians are serious HODLers, with no intention of ever selling back to fiat. They are in it for the dream of no more American built missiles barraging down on their villages.
I recon coinbase is tiny compared to the bigger japanese exchanges. Bitstamp is way bigger as well.

At the end of the day - 2 points:
bitcoin is not only the most interesting, being a leaderless social force, but amongst the crypto universe, that bitcoin spawned, bitcoin IS the only Leaderless one.
Internationally, people have trouble trusting each other or even any one point that all can agree upon. 
Bitcoin, being trustless and leaderless, becomes something that ALL people from all nations can agree upon as the censorship resistant, distributed consensus arbiter of value. 
Secondly, ALL alt coins were created by a known entity. They would all have been shut down IF bitcoin was not out in the wild. It's very existence allows for the space itself.
Just something to consider.

It all Starts with greed and desire to increase fiat net worth.
Buys bitcoin
then crypto dump happens, 
'what, where's my lambo?' sets in, 
but very quickly some study, some enquiry into this thing called bitcoin that was bought occurs.
BANG a light you didn't know was there, snaps on
Understanding of the tech ensues, 
the big picture starts to emerge
You realize this has very little to do with YOU or YOUR 'money' (measured in fiat) and a whole lot to do with inventing a positive future.
You decide to HODL some bitcoin and NEVER sell back to fiat.
You FEEL the private, internal, personal 'fuck you' to the man, and know your resolve goes generations deep.
Often, this is how they are made.

You aught to look into how open source projects work.
You can be part of 'core'.   Just Join the git hub, start reviewing, get involved. Be solution oriented. When you've earned some respect for the quality of your code review, submit some code.

Bit, millibits, microbits are confusing and sound terrible.
Satoshi has sex appeal and makes the most sense.
Only in europe and Umerca do these denominations make sense. Most of the planet is moving towards parity with Satoshi.
It already costs less than a satoshi to buy a Vietnamese dong or an indonesian rupiah. These 2 populations alone dwarf the white world.
Who are we doing this for?? Just for the already privileged white countries? For Umerca, who's doing it's best to thwart bitcoin?

They'll find some way to attack bitcoin again.
These people are ruthless and relentless. They create all the fiat out of thin air, they are all powerful. So the narrative will change, away from fees to something else.

This this this. 
When you hear people saying they wish they bought at under $100, you don't hear them say they were afraid to, but they were and so they didn't buy and they didn't get rewarded.
Bitcoin rewards us for going through the hard dips and crashes. Those who bought under $100 saw it go to 1100 and crash for years to very low prices. Many sold. Those that didn't got rich. THEY were in it for the dream, not more fiat which gets printed at $500 million dollars a day.

I think he never understood the whole IDEA of the collaborative open source development behind bitcoin. I saw a video where he was talking about how core should be fired. You'd think a guy with a billion dollars in BTC, would at least understand there is no 'core' that can be 'fired'.
I have noticed that most of the commenters who seem to genuinely support bcash (as compared to the plethora of paid shills), seem to have this very hierarchical old world view consumerist mindset, where everything is top down administered. They don't seem to get the concept of open source collaboration and nakamoto consensus to them is something that gets debated and then decided and directed from the top down. 
They haven't been able to fit into their brains this new paradigm with no top and no down.
They really seem to need SOMEONE IN CHARGE who is beholden to well debated directives and deadlines - delivering them what they were promised by said authority  (and not in 18 months).
It's why the whole AXA/Blockstream narrative flies with them, after all there must be SOMEONE UP THERE TO BLAME !!!!
Rick is one of those guys and his inability to shift his brain into the new paradigm made him one of the few people in history to actually lose a billion dollars.

Maybe not for you in Umerca, where you do as you are told and have that annoying privileged dumbed down mind set, but there are people all over the planet who already have control of their finances through bitcoin transactions.
Most places on the planet, it is still difficult to move money through one of your privileged corporate centralized systems, unless you are permissioned. It ain't Umerca out here in the free world.
I know of many brown, yellow and black skinned people who are now able to take part in commerce and are prospering, able to pay for education for children and what not.
The adoption of bitcoin in white countries is slow and laborious because you are all so comfortable in the legacy financial system cage you live in, but for the rest of us, it is real and utilitarian right NOW.

In 15 years, you and your point of view will be irrelevant to the generation following you. Nothing ever stays the same. It's fluid.

I don't know about that. 
At least the ripploff is known to be centralized and completely owned and controlled by banksters hell bent on enslaving everyone by making rippleoff the one world currency.
Bcash, same banksters behind it lurking in the shadows, pretending to be the same as or even 'the real' bitcoin. Yet it is not leaderless and it is already completely centralized controlled and mined.
Not sure which one is s bigger scam ?!?!?!?
@_date: 2018-01-03 05:14:05
I know, but over time, the bigger fish in society. Bigger than jihan will also enter the mining space. New miners will be manufactured. It will become competitive and it will slowly become more decentralized. I think bitcoin is at the peak of miner centralization now. Bcash will absorb the wholejihan controlled miners and the new minrrs with the new mining computers will create more pools.
Jihan's miners can stick to what they know best:
- Do as you are told
- mine the centralized mining coin to increase political power.
Bitcoin will prevail. It is a leaderless currency - what the world wants.

@_date: 2019-07-20 15:21:17
That is not how it happened..
The 'agreement' you refer to was a bunch of corporate interests intent on making Bitcoin THEIR coin. They decided these things amongst themselves, arrogantly ignoring us users, in true corporate fashion.
We the users thwarted that with the UASF - User Activated Soft Fork. It was the first time in history that the top down corporate railroading of users failed by users of a system simply exercising their rights.
It was celebrated worldwide. It was a historic event.
The crybaby corporations, who were indignant, baffled and upset that the users could do such a thing,  then went and forked off to create their own corpcoin - again arrogantly thinking they could market the user base into submission and force everyone's hand to choose their corpcoin fork as 'the real Bitcoin'.
It simply didn't work.
That was a long time ago. The world has moved on and completely forgotten about them. 
But you can still see remnants of the false narratives being repeated to this day by a handful of users posting back and forth to each other all day long on rbtc - the heavily censored hijacked sub, where many of us have been banned for pointing out the obvious corporate backed deceptions taking place there.

For members of some non-alignment countries, they can buy bitcoin and trade directly from their bank account through Luno app. In Switzerland, not only ate there BTM at all train stations, but you can buy bitcoin through your bank account directly from bitstamp.
Your masters are keeping you on a leash. And you roll over, play dead and beg. 
@_date: 2019-07-22 01:58:18
And it is already waaaay easier than when the only way to use it was via bitcoin-cli.

@_date: 2018-01-09 03:12:26
You are dreaming mate. The people are waking up. Maybe Umercans will get sucked in because you've been sold up the river and do as you are told. There's not much hope for the most conformist society ever seen.
BUT - the rest of the world.
After what Umerca has been dishing out for generations, people are more than ready for a change and we are interested in the leaderless one. NOT the ripploff.
@_date: 2019-07-21 08:29:05
They absolutely for sure don't understand how it works.
It really will take some time for people who have convinced themselves that they and others are bound to ask for permission from SOMEONE IN CHARGE in every aspect of their lives, to really GET Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:33:15
I hope they do and all the scaredy cat Umercans can see the real effect of that on crypto price.  
It'll become more valuable than ever BECAUSE a central bank forced a western gov to 'ban' it and it kept going.

@_date: 2018-01-11 09:42:14
Good on ya buddy. Take this time to study up on the tech and the true meaning of HODL.
We don't hold onto bitcoin because it will increase our wealth in fiat terms - their money.
We buy the bitcoin because we can see that THIS is the first and ONLY real weapon we've ever had to get out from under the corrupt forces who have suppressed humanity for generations.
If bitcoin does indeed become ubiquitous, then we are rewarded for collectively choosing sound money created leaderlessly. If bitcoin disappears from the earth, then we have the benefits that go with NOT being a sell-out. That's all. No money. No material reward.
It's like a friend of mine always says when talking about being solution oriented in life, whether it's health, spiritual development, permaculture etc...and bitcoin:
"We could lose this struggle, but it doesn't matter. It is simply a better life, day in and day out life is better when you are living solution oriented and waking up in the morning to possibilities. It is the sellout mindset that causes deep misery, no matter what price you accepted."
@_date: 2018-01-03 15:36:33
BTC is the only leaderless coin.
Let's hope it prevails and we don't end up enslaved in some bankster controlled coin like ripploff or bcash.
@_date: 2018-01-13 03:53:31
It's getting fixed by a voluntary team of open source collaborators.
Would you rather a corporate controlled model, completely centralized with one dev like bcash?
@_date: 2019-07-10 11:58:08
Old narrative.
Stuck in the past are we?
I've made hundreds of LN transactions since 2016 (which is how old your lane Saint Bitts LLC sponsored false corporate narrative is), for less than the 8 cents it cost me to open my LN channels.
What's more is those transactions are instant and completely private without done lame custodial 'shuffler'.
Catch up, while you are stuck in the past, the future is steam rolling you and the lame corp coin fork.

They are all bought and traded in terms of satoshi (BTC), so relative to the fiat world when BTC is up in fiat terms, so are the alts -and vice versa.
@_date: 2018-01-15 07:10:54
You are right. HODL is the golden rule. Next comes spend and replace. Spend the bitcoin, but replace it by buying with fiat as soon as you can. Spend with people or businesses who won't just recycle it back to an exchange.
Keep spending, but with real people, NOT corporations.

Yes, I agree.
If poster is only here to increase their fiat stack and don't get what Bitcoin is actually about, they should sell and make their bloodsoaked fiat pennies. 
They probably don't understand karma or any other of life's more subtle energy systems either.
Hopefully there's heaps of these sellouts doing the same thing - enough to be pushing the price down so that those that do get it and are here for the silent bloodless revolution can acquire more Satoshis and be the people these sellout's children will be working for in the coming decades.
It's all working out as it should.
Fortune favours the bold.
@_date: 2019-07-08 07:28:22
Either you've drunk the Saint Bitts LLC false corporate narrative cool aid or you simply don't get it.
Just look at the utter trite garbage filling up FB, twit and reddit posts because it is zero cost for anyone to post anything. This post being a prime example.
That would happen immediately if BTC transactions were free - and that is not even considering what Bitcoin's  formidable and ruthless enemies would do.
In the meantime, instead of being stuck in the past repeating old narratives about fees, maybe it would be smarter of you to get with the present and use lightning wallets for instant, private and virtually free transactions.

It's just my narrow observation of the few miners I know (of which none are huge farms), who just refuse to sell for less than 15K.
They all say that 15 is bottomish and everything below that is a result of bankster manipulation on bankster owned exchanges who are fractionally reserving BTC artificially inflating the supply.
There's only about 700,000 BTC total in circulation available for fiat. The vast majority are HODLed.
This really pisses off the suits, it's why there's been so many anti-HODL narratives. They simply can't get a hold of enough bitcoin and their privileged minds make them indignant.
It's kinda nice watching them squirm.
Meanwhile, all over the world normal people are pouring in and grabbing their 500,000 to 1 million Satoshi and HODLing it.
That is actually ALL that has to happen. 
Everyone grab 500,000 satoshi and wait. Then start to spend and replace. In time, Slowly stopping to spend THEIR bloodsoaked money and trading goods, time, labour and services for BTC.
@_date: 2019-07-22 15:57:10

@_date: 2019-07-22 11:26:50
Try not to get sucked into the whole 'first mover' meme.
That whole concept is descriptive of corporate products and how they appeal to consumers. It is a marketing concept.
Bitcoin is neither a corporation, nor a product. Be very careful in understanding this distinction.
Ultimately there is only ONE reason why Bitcoin is grabbing the attention of people from all walks of life all over the world, and that is simply that it is the first and ONLY bossless, permissionless medium of exchange in history.
That it is digital,  that it is borderless and global, that it can be fast and cheap are all interesting, but completely irrelevant in the scheme of things.
As much as Umercans have been dumbed down and lulled into a sense of not only trust of suits and their corporations, but  even deify them as being special in some way, the rest of the planet is VERY WARY of suits and corporations.
Keep that in mind.
Bitcoin is global. Umerca is very late and extremely slow in adoption and ultimately quite irrelevant to Bitcoin's steady growth.
People in the world outside of Umerca are enamoured with bitcoin because it has proven itself to be ungamable and truly bossless.
Out here in the world NO ONE will EVER swap the old boss (banksters) for the new boss (latest flashy bitcoin wannabe website and their slick looking 'team').

Waaay too late for the alt thing. That's so over.
Bitcoin hasn't even started ramping up yet. 
In 20 years 100,000 satoshi will be considered a fortune.
Very few people will have that much liquid cash on hand as it'll be moving around, much like dollars today - very few people, even billionaires, have a million bucks just sitting there liquid.
It's all stock and assets and paper value.
@_date: 2019-07-17 13:27:57
That just means you haven't looked at it or tried it. There's nothing third party about it at all.
I remember when SPV wallets came out and we were all freaked out by this idea that there would only be a few nodes verifying ALL of the SPV transactions.
For a short time it was that way, but eventually it diluted into many nodes handling SPV verifications......   on BTC anyway. 
On the bcash (bitcoin cash) fork chain virtually ALL transactions are verified by Saint Bitts LLC owned servers, but that is a corpcoin, their user base is ok with third party middlemen and decentralization is not an objective anyway.
On BTC, that would NEVER fly.
Look into LN. Download a few wallets and start sending satoshi to yourself. It is great fun and you can feel the speed and privacy - feel the future. 
On chain on (any chain) seems so old in comparison.

Not worth wasting your time with negatives OR positives of bcash.  It's a dying project. All verifiable stats point to it being in a slow grinding death for more than a year already. 
You've probably noticed the same handful of user names posting the same lies and false corporate narratives back and forth on EVERY SINGLE THREAD.
That aught to tell you everything.
It's a desperate place. Stay away from it. You'll be a happier person.

I pay almost all of my monthly bills in BTC, and have been for years. I had to push a few of them into the future, but it really made my life simpler.

Reddit is extremely Americo-centric.
@_date: 2019-07-21 13:59:02
You are just repeating the same false narratives.
Sorry for your loss, but holding onto the past, rehearsing debates over and over, and the promise of a flippening that will never happen will not lessen the burden. 
Better you just run a node, see what is involved even at the current limit, do some simple math on a calculator, Accept you were duped by corporate interests (a good worthwhile lesson learned in itself) and move forward. Leave 2016 in 2016.
If you want to actually feel the future of payments, download a few lightning wallets and send some satoshi back and forth to yourself, it makes EVERYTHING else out there seems so old and clunky.
@_date: 2019-07-08 14:31:52
For censorship, you need to visit the hijacked sub. Any dissension from the Saint Bitts corporate narrative and immediate ban.
@_date: 2019-07-27 00:00:02
Thanks for trying, but reddit is Americo-centric and that country has been told that Bitcoin is an investment vehicle, some kind of digital asset that gets bought sold and valued in their almighty dollar.
It's why Umerca is so far behind.
It's good that you try and wake up the slumbering nation, but you'll probably pay the price in very predictable comments. 
My hat off to you.

Take it from someone who IS global, as in travels frequently and has family in all 5 continents, yes, it is taking off globally.
This is the one thing that people fail to realize. Bitcoin is growing EVERYWHERE simultaneously.
At an estimated 1 million new users a month, it is still very very slow and very very early.
I recommend getting on top of how lightning wallets function. Grab a couple - lightning wallet from blockstream, blue wallet custodial and eclair - then play with sending satoshi back and forth to yourself.
Then you'll be on the edge of the movement as far as users are concerned.

It was part of the plan - create the Euro, create the Aiseo, create the Amero, then false flag crash the world economy, then port EVERYONE OVER to THEIR one world currency, completely permissioned........
....... And those who do not have the mark of the beast cannot trade.
They never got past the Eurozone and EURO - we were saved by a particularly altruistic powerful Asian family after the orchestrated SE Asian tigers crash of 1997, which completely thwarted their plans and gave Bitcoin time to appear.
Bitcoin is here to save us from that mess, that hell.
No if we can only get past THEIR  'Bitcoin is an investment' narrative.

But yes, by and far, I enjoy many more conversations about bitcoin crypto and open source decentralization in general with my grand children's friends than I do with people in my generation. 
Maybe it is just old dogs, new tricks.
Maybe it is because the young can clearly see the mess we are in as it affects them so much more directly and so are open to exploring solutions, while us retirees may not be living the dignified retirements of previous generations, but we are also not up against the uncertain future our corrupt money masters have laid before us.

@_date: 2019-07-22 01:55:50
There's no 'flaws', that is part of the Saint Bitts LLC corporate narrative. The path that has been chosen by CONSENSUS - a very long time ago - is second layer.
It is being worked on. BTC and LN are open source collaborations. It takes time. There is no boss, no governing body like in the bcash corpcoin project, which turned out to be a colossal failure. 
By running a node, you are familiar with the resources it takes to do the initial synch and stay on top of broadcasting and verifying.
It should be very obvious to you that simply changing a few parameters and changing the block size would be shamefully silly in Bitcoin's development at this point, because decentralization and bosslessness, permissionless money is the prime objective.
Bitcoin is the first and ONLY bossless medium of exchange in world history. It is the ONE thing that makes it unique to EVERY other medium of exchange
You take that away in pursuit of consumer oriented ideas like speed and cost and you've lost everything, as demonstrated in both of the corporate run and owned bcash forks.

When all the new investors in both bitcoin and bcash double down and study after their supposed losses, they'll get educated, dump bcash and start buying snd HODLing bitcoin. Seen it year in and year out.
Remember the ripploff run up 9 months ago? Well, the banksters took their money back from that didn't they.
They'll do it again, can't help themselves.

It was a scam perpetrated on generations of kind, normal, and innocent people. The scam was kept in motion for so long through wars, oppression and theft of natural resources.

'Death and taxes are inevitable'
'War makes peace'

Lightning is way faster, way cheaper and completely private without having to 'shuffle'.
The whole premise that bcash is fast and cheap is so lame. So is paypal. It's easy if you sacrifice decentralization, which they have.
The whole reason bitcoin is interesting yo anyone NOT in the permissioned, nannied first world, is that it is bossless, secure and permissionless.
Bcash sacrificed all of that pandering to the consumer mindset users giving them speed and cheap transactions, completely missing the point on why Bitcoin is valued globally.
Again, it is a handful of fools who never understood open source development OR nakamoto consensus.
Now they are 97% down and are stuck in the past.
Stay clear away, it is toxic, you really will be happier.
Download the lightning wallet AND blue wallet and start playing with sending instant, 100% private cost free transactions back and forth to yourself.

No it doesn't
As fiat currencies continue to inflate and central banks continue to erode savings and investments, people are very happy to store their wealth in the robust secure bitcoin. 
Scaling is important to a degree, but remaining secure and decentralized is far more important.
You can always use a decentralized miner controlled coin if you are only after fast, cheap payments. Then there's the alt coins, which you can use for fast cheap payments.
Use litecoin for that. In time very secure, fast cheap payments on bitcoin will be a reality. For now, in the short term, stop worrying. 
The money will flow into robust secure deflationary 'store of wealth'.

Reading through the info on all these coins (thank you for the heads up) I think that there is a big difference. For example the new bitcoin gold, interesting idea, best of luck to them. But try are not a centralized group of miners trying to hijack the actual history of the chain and them somehow magically BE THE INE TRUE Bitcojn.

Bitcoin will be the central trusted value in which all currencies - fiat or crypto - will be measured in.
Gov will not be able to borrow fake money from banks who don't have that money UNTIL the gov 'borrows' it and use it to further their mission of surveillance, war and oppression.
This is good. Do not be afraid.
When the founding fathers created America, they were all AmeriCANs - now in 2017 all the AmeriCAN'Ts would label them as 'libertarians'. The gov was never supposed to be so rich. The idea which made America the bright shining light of the world is that the gov should be poor , virtually powerless and exists only to mediate disputes between 2 parties under contract through a court system based on consensus decisions from peers.
Umerca left THAT road a very very long time ago. Now in 2017 most people believe that Umerca is great because you have a bloated military and you can steal shit from the rest of the world. They believe the gov should be all powerful and have rules for EVERYTHING, even down to deciding on what an individual should or shouldn't put in their body. 'Yes you should take our toxic vaxx, but no, you are not allowed that line of cocaine.'
The founding fathers would have viewed this current state of affairs as tragic, the gov should not be able to dictate what an individual puts in their own body. This trend like most Umercan trends is extremely Un-American.
I'll be down voted by a swarm of UmeriCANTs for speaking the truth. They've been dumbed down and respond violently to anything that sits outside of the programs installed into them.
Yet the whole world waits for the handful of AmeriCANs to somehow overcome the ignorance and foolishness of the sea of AmeriCANTs.
Truly voluntary taxes that are spent locally will more than make up for a few services and some roads - if we'll even need roads.
It is the military budget - that has to go.
Maybe Umercans can learn to be peaceful and get along with each other like most of the rest of the planet.

The narrative that EVERYONE has taken to be true =
That Bitcoin is some kind of new digital 'asset' that gets bought, sold and valued in fiat terms.
Where in fact it IS the world currency by which all currencies will be valued in.
For example right now 1 dollar will cost you roughly 17,000 Satoshi depending on where you buy that dollar.

Might be ok for centralized mining coin bcash to have that outlook, but for a 3B dollar asset class in bitcoin, things have to be a bit more thorough before being committed to the wild.
Bcash is a great experiment. We'll see what centralized mining and control lead to in the crypto space. No doubt it will be interesting to watch, but bitcoin is trusted INTERNATIONALLY because it is leaderless.
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:09:32
Learn the HODL ethos.
NEVER sell to fiat.
Either bitcoin becomes the reserve currency of the world or zero. For a true HODLer this IS the mindset.
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:14:28
Why are you guys supporting a 'digital token' that is centralized, completely controlled, pre-mined and owned by the banksters themselves.
Bitcoin may be our last chance to get out from under the yoke of planetary oppression. Throughout history these people have used exactly the same tactic to enslave us. They use our greed, they get us to sell each other out.
In this case, they are getting you to exchange your fiat, which they printed, for a digital token that they wholly control. They get you to do this because you see the price going up.
Well, guess what, they control the price movement as well.
They are trying to suck us all into their version of crypto by using our greed.

The HODL wall gets stronger and higher in price.

It is completely irrelevant what wall st does. They are writing up contracts that simply bet on the future price.
They may as well be betting on the outcome of a boxing match. It doesn't affect the bout.
All of it is contracted and priced and settled in fiat.
THEY will bet in bitcoin going up - because THAT is inevitable, but convince the clients who (mistakenly) still trust them to bet on the 'bubble popping' and will take all that fiat money off of them.
HODLers will still HODL because we will NEVER trade back to fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:00:29
You got it buddy. It is separate and irrelevant to bitcoin as they are not buying it at all.

That's where YOU come in.
This is an open source collaboration. There is no THEY that should make it easier, just like there is no one out there teaching people how to safely use, transact or store cash.
We teach each other. Scams are inevitable. Information How to adjust fees or use lightning is available and slowly becoming more accessible.
Misinformation and disinformation from corporate interests trying to convince people that the world's ONLY bossless money is not as good as their proprietary version is rife and that will continue for the short term, but will slowly be replaced by real understanding in the community by real people teaching each other in real life.
You should have been here a few years ago when you could only find scams and false information when searching through goooooogle.  It was rough. Those results slowly started to be replaced by legit exchanges, wallets and information.
I always just point people to AA's videos, so they can start to learn about the true importance of Bitcoin in today's world.
The rest comes easy after that understanding is in place. Like the idea of fees becomes completely acceptable as it currently is - once you understand the IDEA of open source collaborated money of the people.

I'm not sure. I never wait too long. The people i transact with aren't having to spend immediately, so it hasn't been an issue for me.
It is like when Diner's club first came out. I had a friend who had one and he was always trying to use it. On the odd occasion, he'd find someone who accepted it and then he'd have to wait for them to run it through a mechanical device from which they'd give him a carbon copied slip which he'd sign and he'd keep a copy. It just seemed so clunky and burdensome. I'd say, 'just too much hassle'.  
Sometimes he'd just pay cash because he was short of time. 
So, same thing: If I ever have a transaction the requires speed, I'll pay cash. 
The tech will follow need for expediency.

Mate, good on ya!! So inspiring.
The secret to wealth accumulation has always been to simply save 10% of your income and forget about it. Read 'the richest man in babylon'. This worked for thousands of years and I can't tell you how soul destroying it has been the last 2 decades where savers were directly punished, not to mention the last hundred years where savers were indirectly punished through inflation.
It warms my heart to read that this age old ethos is not only viable again, but in bitcoin extremely fast.
Please, keep up the good work. Keep doing it. Keep earning money and keep saving. I'm an old man so I can say: 'I'm proud of you son.' Even I don't know you.
It is the example of young people like you which will lift your generation and change the world into a prosperous, peaceful place.
Thank you for sharing.

That's not HODLing. That's holding to sell back to fiat at some later date. HODLing is NEVER selling back to fiat at ANY price. It means collecting and keeping bitcoin as much as you can afford, in order to spend when bitcoin is ubiquitous.

NEO is a great idea, but isn't intended to be a 'currency' as such, but more a smart contract platform.
Bitcoin - the network, has never been successfully hacked. Although the attacks are numerous.
I met the founder of NEO recently. Very very impressive, smart smart guy. I would invest in NEO just on him alone, let alone what they are building. Great project, in many ways more interesting than ethereum.
And as much as comparing NEO to Eth makes sense, as they have a similar vision, comparing either to bitcoin as a secure currency or wealth store, is futile. Apples and oranges.

I think you'll find in time that miners using fossil fuels will become unprofitable and miners using new energy will be all that's left. The problem is not using power. It's where you get it from.
When the banks downsize and all THAT waste is no longer taking place, you'll see power consumption required for us the transact will have decreased.
POS is all fine and well, if there exists a chain which is unowned, decentralized in every way INCLUDING consensus, secure (because of POW) permissionless and borderless.
If there is no such chain ALL alts will be shutdown, because they can be.
Bitcoin is the only true unowned open source crypto. What's more without it, the others are doomed.

There's bitcoin and there's Satoshi.
Only a fraction of the world's population uses dollars (all of them), euro and pounds.

The whole first paragraph , whether intentionally or not describes a system which does away with the need for a central bank. It is not directly discussed. What is discussed is as you say is the peer to peer cash. That just happens to be the recipe for ending the bankster reign, that's all.

I'm in it for the revolution, not money. And unlike even the bcash crowd, I like Roger. I have met him and always feel that we would be a dangerous team if we ever worked together. EVERYONE would hate us, we are both extreme in our view that everyone should take 100% responsibility for themselves and their lives.
I tail against totalitarian forces trying to control. The fascist tendencies behind the real powers behind bcash are frightening - and I ain't talking about roger.
The whole divide and conquer agenda starting with the fake 'block size debate' and ending in the failure of bcash originated in think tanks paid for by banksters trying to slow this bus down and seize control. They did slow the bus, but for the first time in history failed to dupe EVERYONE into their fear trap, just the bcash crowd.

Until the vast majority are REAL HODLers, who will NEVER sell back to fiat at any price. The ones who understand bitcoin will inevitably be ubiquitous. We start SPENDING then.
This is not about increasing your net worth in a dying fiat currency, but about aquiring as much of the currency that all currencies will be priced in, while it's still cheap cheap cheap.
At some point the bitcoins liquid for fiat exchange will be ONLY those freshly mined coins, from miners who still use fossil fuel energy.
I know you must be very smart and a sophisticated trader, but I urge you to consider the possibility that there are many many bitcoin holders who will never sell. 
We are just the people who are tired of using THEIR money and it's effect on the very existence of surveillance, war and oppression. This is our way of saying that we just aren't going to take part in that any more.

Even if the bank2.0 theory made the slightest amount of sense, and the whole business of payment processing became controlled by a few big players, the actual issuance of the money, the control of THAT, would still be history.

ALL of them projects with leaders. 
Only bitcoin is leaderless and open source lead by decentralized consensus.
Why are we doing this??
Is it for sound money, controlled by no one OR is it just fast transaction times cheap?
The banks will serve up very fast, cheap options that they completely control, which will be way cheaper and way faster than any of your alternatives.
It is NOT what this is all about.

There is no HODLing 'too long'. That is holding with intent to 'cash out' to fiat.
Real HODLers are HODLing until bitcoin is ubiquitous, what we use in daily life, what ALL other currencies are valued in, fiat or crypto.
That means even if bitcoin went to zero, real HODLers won't go back to fiat OR a crypto with centralized consensus.
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:35:48
I think the point is that it is actually insane to value things from the point of view of a fundamentally corrupt point of reference -  a corrupt money creation mechanism that is insanely inflationary. How can you actually get a valuation from that? It makes much more sense to value things from something stable like gold or silver. When we do that, we can actually see the deterioration of fiat value.
@_date: 2017-12-18 09:35:36
We are exactly on the same page. 
I'm sorry, my hastiness made it unclear. My comment about the rich was not referring to normal wealthy people who made their wealth by contributing something that people want or need, but rather the privileged class - the banksters and wall street crowd which contribute nothing. In fact, their activities in creating unsound money causes the normal wealthy great difficulties, and as a result those that depend on their brains and entrepreneurship.
I am more than happy for people to be rich. The concentration of wealth can achieve amazing things.
My gripe is that those in control of the money supply and creation of it are dumbed down thugs. Wealth is being transferred to people with brains and hopefully some compassion and understanding.
It is how the money is created that is important, that the money is sound and not created by a privileged few.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:14:21

Do we need to know more?
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:27:14
Nowhere near the real world use case for mastercard or visa, so why bother?
Oh......  THEY own those also.
If you really believe the birth of crypto is about quick transactions and low fees and sacrificing decentralization is a reasonable compromise, you haven't read enough history.
The REASON bitcoin and as a result crypto even EXIST is so the world may have some leaderless sound money that is not controlled or even controllable by ANYONE - even the oh so benevolent ripple owners.
And yes, 80% of centrally 'mined' coins are not released for circulation.
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:34:10
The word HODL is getting abused.
A HODLer is someone who gets it and decides to put money they can afford to live without into Bitcoin because it is 'our' money, not backed by debt and not controlled by any one entity. If you HODL, you will NEVER sell for fiat.
If you are just holding until some price point to 'cash out', you haven't understood what you are a part of or are just another trader. You cannot make claim to be a HODLer.
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:28:29
Most likely the truth.
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:54:32
Seems you haven't been able to get past all the big block propaganda.
Update: it leads to centralization. As you can see with bcash. Completely centralized as we speak actually thinking they can be centralbank 2.0
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:42:40
The idea is to constantly purchase the currency of the future for when it IS the world's agreed upon reserve currency.
Real HODLers will NEVER sell to fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:05:59
There's very little 'selling' taking place. It is pretty much the same coins being traded back and forth by traders and noobs who still have there coins on an exchange.
The vast majority are still under HODL 
Bcash seems 'up' on price, but usage is insignificant. People speculating in the short term profit taking potential to increase bitcoin holdings is rife, but a small pool of liquid coins. No one uses it to actually transact. Litecoin is way ahead in that respect. Easier too.
Bitcoin is THE leaderless phenomena that attracted us all in the first place. Bcash is centrally mined, centrally decided and in line for a small corporate group of centralized nodes.
Very VERY dangerous.

What? You aren't using it now? Now IS the time to use it.
HODL first.
But also, for daily utility in life:
Put $1000. Then, when it's up - even a little, pay some bills. But replace btc you spent back at a bit lower than when you spent it.
Think from bitcoin, not from fiat. One dollar is about 7,500 Satoshi at the moment. Look at what life costs you from Satoshi. On a monthly basis, try to have some Satoshi left over from paying your living expenses.
You'll find that by the time you've spent the $1000 that you stored in btc instead of the bank, you've not only increased your spending power, but you haven't 'spent' it all as you would have if you just kept it in your checking account. 
Just keep going like this. It is a long term bull run, so over time, you'll always be up and the spending value if your income will increase. 
The plus is, you'll always have some btc growing as you go.

Millibits and bits still end up being useless to a population far far bigger than the US or Europe. It is only a handful of Countries for whom millitbits may necessary (for wrapping  your head around the number as this thread suggests) as an intermediate step to Satoshi also being at parity with even those government issued currencies.j
At 8,100 per bitcoin these were already the satoshi values of the following currencies.
648 Satoshi for a Mexican Peso.
371 Satoshi for a Thai Baht
243 Satoshi for a Philippine Peso
119 Satoshi per Nepalese Rupee 
110 Satoshi for Japanese Yen.
 9.04 Satoshi for a Myanmar Kyat
0.91 Satoshi for an Indonesian Rupiah
0.54 Satoshi for a Vietnamese Dong.
IT TAKES 2 VIET DONG TO BUY A SINGLE SATOSHI !!!!!
These are significant populations who are increasingly technology obsessed and well aware of inflation and banking stealing your savings from you, which are not that far off parity to Satoshi.
Satoshi sounds cool, if you want my 2 Sats worth.
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:30:03
It might be an idea to actually do some study and realize what this is all about.
Have you ever met a single person who likes banks?
Even people who work for banks hate banks.  
If everyone can have their bank in their pocket, wouldn't people do that?
Have you had bitcoin on your phone? Have you had that feeling? It doesn't FEEL the same as having money in your pocket.
I'm more than sure that having tokenized unsound money printed by gov so they can have more control and more war, is NOT something people will flock to.
Corporations, yes. But they are not ACTUALLY people. And the corporate model is flawed and dying.

Are you really following this narrative without looking at the technology. Lightening is a brilliant DECENTRALIZED open source secondary layer.
Yes, banks and corporations will be able to payment process over it, much like visa does in fiat, but no one owns open source protocols. There is no patent, this is uneducated FUD and you drank it in. 
Even you or I can open lightening channels.
Try running a node on bcash when the blocksize is in the gigabytes. This is what The banksters are salivating over.

I very much enjoyed this discourse. Thank you.
I've been formulating a thought based around the idea that ALL alt coins CAN exist because of the very existence of Bitcoin. That there is ONE leaderless, open source, decentralized POW, chain proven to be robust, then it is 'safe' to have a cryptosphere will possibly millions of coins.
I think the interest in bitcoin internationally is simply the leaderless aspect and the censorship resistance. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:40:56
Very well written.

They all have known founders and developers. Not bitcoin by a very long shot.
Not that they aren't great, but they would NEVER have happened without the very existence of Bitcoin, the unowned one, preceding them.
No one would have been interested internationally, which is where this phenomena took root and grew.
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:06:47
If it's true HODL.
Do NOT sell your crypto for THEIR fiat.
Make them scrap and fight for only the freshly mined coins. Make sure you and everyone you know is buying by cost dollar averaging.
Make them compete with each other and millions of small purchasers for ONLY the bitcoin being mined.
Decrease the liquid supply.
Spread the word.

You are correct in the agenda, but wrong in your idea that it is socialists. It is both 'left' and 'right'. The powers that be control both 'sides'.

I think Bernie was getting onto the concept of actually taxing the corporations, much like they do in MOST other countries. He also zeroed in on the top 0.01% that contribute nothing.
I don't think I heard him speaking about taking money from you or I.
Correct me if I'm wrong, please. But this is my current understanding.

@_date: 2017-12-10 09:40:34
It'll be bitcoin. All the alts can be closed down as decision making is centralized.
It's the only one we can for sure trust and agree upon.
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:17:30
Because the bank's 'reserves' are decreased and they only hold 1.2% of what they lend. So your 12,000 dollar withdrawal represents 1,000,000 that they have already loaned out.
@_date: 2018-09-07 04:15:38
In fact we all have something to hide. Just ask people what their income is, what their porn preferences are, if they have any medical conditions that they don't make public knowledge.
The 'i've got nothing to hide' consciousness is fake and has been installed as a program into all the sheople, yet they all have things to hide. The result is more cognitive dissonance which is so pervasive and increasing in Umerca, resulting in dumber and dumber population.

@_date: 2017-12-30 02:51:48
There are no implications. Just can't use an anonymous virtual bank account to send money to exchanges anymore.
Umercans will be will shocked to find out that in other countries, you can open a temporary anonymous bank account or virtual bank account.
In dumbed down enslaved countries like Umerca, this concept doesn't even compute.
So no, don't worry, although the net is closing, it's still easier, less friction and cheaper to buy bitcoins just about everywhere else besides Umerca.

Maybe a 'superior technology', but is it leaderless, decentralized etc?
This IS the point. Do you really just want to go back to 'trusting' some project? May as well stay with central banks.
It is the open source leaderlessness of bitcoin which made it real. Now everyone wants to forget about it and go for centralized tech by some 'team' like the ripploff or bcash?
Let's remember THE reason we are in this please.

No. Decide if you are in this for ideological reasons or just to increase your fiat net worth.
If you are just a pussy sellout trying to make money, then good luck with that and continue following the other blind redditors.  
If you GET it. Then HODL.

BTC maximalist - pretty funny. So everyone who is interested in Bitcoin because it is decentralized, permissionless and most importantly UNOWNED, now has to fit into your pathetic little 'maximalist' box.
NO ONE internationally, where they are very familiar with being in a foreign Permissioned system (like SWIFT, credit cards, paypal etc) will EVER be willing to replace the devil they know permissioned owned system with the devil they don't know permissioned and owned system.

Just you seemed confused by my comment. 
Bitcoin is NOT some new kind of digital asset that gets bought, sold and valued in fiat dollars.
It is the value layer by which all things will be valued.
It IS the world currency.
It makes more sense to see fiat as a temporary necessary evil which gets bought and sold and valued in terms of Satoshi so we can buy stuff in the short term until bitcoin is ubiquitous.

Banksters would love to see every new born child issued a blockchain address on the only chain left that they control.
Each new born child will be issued THEIR address, there will only be one per person. That address stores and tracks all data about the person and ALL transactions are to be done through this address only.
This they lust after. Bcash and rippleoff are just the first attempts yo get there.
We must stay vigilant.

As the difficulty adjustment approached, bcash whales started a pump, it was coordinated with a shit load of media exposure and social media shilling paid for in FIAT by banksters.
Think about it, when has bitcoin ever received so much push from lame stream media. With bitcoin, they only cover it because they HAVE to. Because it is news. Why is bcash suddenly news?
The fact are, bcash has a centralized group of people who are in charge and make the decisions. In a true open source protocol like bitcoin, this is impossible.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:10:05
I think they may have entered bargaining phase
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:29:44
Bitcoin's existence makes it possible for ALL other coins to exist. Remember, no one knows who Satoshi Nakamoto is. 
Do you really believe that THEY would tolerate ANY centralized consensus coin to even exist? Those organizations would be crucified if bitcoin (the one true un-owned crypto) didn't exist.
It has nothing to do with early mover marketing bullshit. Or even 'network effect'. These are ideas you have only just recently read about and come to understand - because of bitcoin and everyone talking talking.
Before alts, no one used these terms or viewed bitcoin as a 'product gaining market share.' It was viewed as the revolution we have all been waiting for. The tool to bring down the multi-generational corrupt bankster power structures. A way to end the IDEA of having a privileged few 'create' money for the rest of us to squabble over.
This is money, not a product from a corporation.
People learn to trust it BECAUSE there is no 'organization' full of suits at the helm.
For this reason Bitcoin WILL become the central world currency by which ALL other currencies (fiat, crypto or psuedo-crypto ripploff) will be measured in.
There will be no 'bitcoin is trading at ....'
It will become US dollar 0.12 Satoshi, Yuan 21 Satoshi, etc

Are we forgetting that what interested us in bitcoin in the first place is that it was un- owned and leaderless?
All alt coins have a leadership point. That is all fine and well IF AND ONLY if THE original leaderless, censorship resistant open source chain IS the measuring stick by which ALL currencies - fiat or crypto - are measured.
This is vitally important. Otherwise we are risking the kind of dystopian future hollywood has been programming us for for decades.
Ripploff for example. If we all just blindly used THEIR crypto, THEY would have us under their grasp and would have retained the power to issue currency from thin air. Only now, you are given an address at birth and it is your only address and all things are attached to it. It is your number.

Unfortunately, all these AmeriCAN'Ts have taken the bait and subscribe to the belief, the one that Edward Bernays was paid to install into the mass mind of the population. 
The belief that there is a left, there is a right and that one should choose one of those teams and stay loyal to it.
It is just a belief. 
Become free of the Bernaysian illusion, for THEY control both the left and the right. The entire argument was installed into you, regardless of which side you chose.
It is still possible to become an AmeriCAN and unlearn all this programming that you hold so dear to your hearts.
It is quite possible that political issues can be viewed from all directions, not just the linear 2D scale we've subscribed to. Is it possible there may be as many as 8 billion different ways of looking at a political picture?

In a very scary scenario. Two generations along, it's a rippleoff world. You are born and given a ripploff address. That is the only address you are legally ever able to use to transact. It also holds all information about you. School records, social media comments, medical --- everything. Anonymity as a word is very underutilized let alone as an idea. Every transaction is taxed.
People are born into direct control, direct slavery, always surveilled and tracked, and their whole ability to exist in society can be turned off by some centralized authority.  WOW, I just realized how much of that sentence already describes much of the world we live in today.

No one is anti big blocks in a maximalist sense. That's just bankster propaganda as part of their divide and conquer strategy that failed and resulted in them forking bcash.

Zero security should be sacrificed.
THE only reason we even know what bitcoin is, is because it is secure AND decentralized.
Bcash has a group who literally own it. And that is not mentioning the power the miners have. They are salivating for the day they have blocks to big for nodes to be decentralized.
At that point, you've just replaced the old boss for the new boss.
Bcash is only 'working well' because no one uses it.
It is owned, centralized and backed by the banksters.

By the time the blocksize NEEDS to increase, the fork won't be contentious. The fork that led to the bcash fiasco was not about blocksize, that's just what you were sold.

From the point of view of increasing your fiat net worth you are correct in your opinions. But from the larger picture that many of us have which has nothing to do with increasing our fiat value, your opinion is non-sensical.

Because hip hop peaked in 2003, it has been stagnant as an 'art form' since 1989. Introducing a white boy as part of viacom's take over of hip hop in 2000 has just been adding to the stagnancy and decline.

There has been nothing new in this scene for decades besides that now it is corporate music shoved down the throats of everyone because it is in the corporate agenda's interest to keep ya all stupid, angry, docile and consuming.
Baroque music brought on the enlightenment releasing the western world from the dark ages, classical and romantic era increased general intelligence, Jazz changed the world, blues lifted the spirit, rock music stopped wars. Hip hop sells lots of stuff for their corporate masters.
Keep your head in the sand, it is what THEY have programmed you to do.

Might be anecdotal, but it's working for me mate.
8 transactions yesterday, most expensive one 56 cents.
You go ahead and stick with your block searching to validate your beliefs. 
I recommend learning how to set your own transaction fees and transacting yourself. Get Your own anecdotal experience.
While you people sit and talk about the future of money, for me it is NOW. 
For me, bitcoin already offers real utility in my life. I am in my 8th decade and by being 100% in, practicing spend and replace, my meager retirement income offers me a dignified existence. You may continue to argue with me from your point of zero experience, but ultimately it  matters not at all to me.
The utility IS important to me. I transact most days.
I NEVER pay these high fees the shills pretend are true on reddit. It doesn't matter. I know from my own daily use of this amazing grace saving technology.

I was asked who THEY are because for the first time in history WE know who THEY are. I pointed in the right direction to get started. I suggested a book to read, but figured being a dumbed down Umercan, you probably have bad reading comprehension for detailed works of thorough research and so also pointed to a great cartoon production which is entertaining AND informative.
At no point did I refer to a 'documentary' or give you reason to put me into that tidy little pigeon hole you reserve for people who intimidate your comfortable ignorance.
That's just you being a classic dumbed down Umercan dick.
You probably could have watched the cartoon by now, and gained a better understanding of the world around you, of which you are rightfully confused. THEY Did after all deceive you !!
The cartoon is simply a starting point, say a key to a single lock on a door to greater understanding. The book, another key. 
There are thousands of pages of academic research into this that you simply would not be able to fit into your narrow mindset, so I tried to help ease the way for you.
You react to me with the usual angry ideas that you have been programmed to do.

You are sad if you really believe this drivel. In bitcoin there is no 'allow' by anyone, it is fundamentally leaderless.
Bcash on the other hand is a banksters wet dream. Already centralized mining. A few block size increases... Centralized nodes and BINGO. The banksters have complete control of centralized money supply again.
It's why JP Morgan are and lame stream media are so behind it. There is a leadership point.

Show the roof that you dumped all your bitcoin.
More FUD.  
What happens when your transactions exceed the 76 per second? You'll have same problem. Increase block size again? And again?
Start a chain that has completely decentralized mining. Then increase bock sizes till you have centralized nodes. Presto, the banks win and they have control of the money again.
JP Morgan is funding all of these bcash shills.

Then eventually a True HODLer who will NEVER sell back to fiat.
The HODL wall keeps increasing and liquidity tends more and more towards only the newly mined coins.
The millionaires and billionaires have to scrap and fight for the 12.5 bitcoin coming out every 10 minutes. Bit the HODLers and new normal people are also grabbing up what they can.
The value starts to really really increase. The HODL wall gets set at the new higher value.
Viscious circle continues.
Bitcoin grows by an order of magnitude by an ever decreasing time frame until it really is ubiquitous. Dollars become worthless as no one will take the suit's million dollars.
Power shifts from the corruptible to normal people who just want to get along and watch their children grow up in peace.
The governments lose their power to print fake money to pay for wars, oppression, surveillance and control of the media.
Peace and prosperity reign on earth.

Bitcoin IS the innovative winner. It is trustless and unowned. 
it's just volatile.
If you are gonna need that money in the next 5 to 10 years, probably shouldn't 'invest'.
Bitcoin is NOT an investment. It is the global reserve currency of the future.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:32:58
 I completely agree with you. Many many currencies will find a huge value and be chosen for such reasons as speed, cost and some extra function like smart contract. The space is vast. ICO will become THE WAY people invest their savings. It will make wall st impotent. The change sweeping over us is still unimaginable.
The speed of it is not only fast, but accelerating. This is why it is already redundant thinking about bitcoin as ANY past phenomena, besides maybe linux. Bitcoin IS the one that is leaderless, censorship resistant, secure etc. it is the one that ALL people - worldwide - can trust. Bitcoin is the central peg that cannot be shut down, which makes the very EXISTENCE of all other alt coins possible. For example, there is simply no way that Vitalek would even be known to us if Ethereum's emergence predated bitcoin. THEY would have taken that apart so fast, we wouldn't even know that it had happened.
I would recommend for you to invest some time in watching ALL of Andreas Antonopolous  playlist on youtube.
I find myself having to keep some bitcoin on an exchange in order to buy litecoin for transactions i usually make in bitcoin. These people know the issues, they would prefer to use bitcoin, understand the tech, are patient, yet for utility, when fees are high we move it in litcoin. Often i send directly to their exchange wallet from my exchange wallet, they flip back to bitcoin.
I think for many of us, for utility, during high miner spam periods, we do use other coins.
This is not a 'bad' thing. The important thing is that we understand that for the GLOBAL population outside of the USA, what is important, is the very existence of a chain that we can ALL agree upon simply because it IS LEADERLESS. That CHAIN, the censorship resistant, robust one, that cannot be controlled by any one entity - that is the one the Global population is interested in. 
If it turns out that small transactions get palmed off to smaller or even centralized currencies, it actually shouldn't matter as ALL currencies will be measured by the deciding super-underlayer Bitcoin.
The danger is if some centralized entity like ripploff or bcash convinces 'the market' that convenience and speed are more important than secure sound money, thereby becoming the base layer. Then we just got a new boss apparently replacing the old boss. I do think they could pull it off in the USA because you people do as you are told by your media.
But the rest of the planet won't fall for it. They are interested in this space BECAUSE of the leaderless one.

I too am interested in the price of a dollar.
Are you good with html? Might be an idea to develop a site. Just grab the API from bitstamp and divide by 100,000,000, chart it and bingo.

@_date: 2018-09-13 11:12:02
You are simply wrong.
Bitcoin is not the biggest and best because of some 'first mover advantage'. That is a marketing term reserved for products and corporations. Bitcoin is neither.
You have to take into account the fact that the entire planet is involved with bitcoin, not just the USA. Outside of America, no one will trust a crypto that is owned ie, there are known founders and a known team, especially if there is a corporation behind it and double especially if it is American. The citizens of the rest of the world have been burned many times over by centralized systems - especially those centralized in corporations in America. There is no point in trading the old boss in for a new boss.
Bitcoin's appeal to the vast majority of the planet is that it is NOT owned, that there is finally a currency which we can all agree upon has value by consensus rather than by force.
Also, be very clear on this - It is in every single nation's interest to be free of the US dollar standard except for the USA.
You must take this into account. It is also why Americans are so late and slow to adopt - the banks and corporations and government are terrified of upsetting the status quo, so they lay one narrative after the other out there. Almost all of those narratives are weak. The strong narrative that really has legs is that Bitcoin is some kind of digital asset to be bought, sold and valued in US dollars. Whereas in fact, Bitcoin will inevitably become the standard by which ALL value will be determined. It is inevitable BECAUSE no one owns or controls it. It levels the playing field.
Right now America always has the competitive advantage simply because it's currency is the world global reserve currency. It allows America to build up insane military force, throw fake wars and oppress people in every single nation.  It allows mass surveillance of every single man woman and child alive today.
NO ONE wants this to go on. 
As people become aware that Bitcoin is the first, only and possibly the last chance humanity has to get out of this mess, they get involved. They are not getting involved just to increase more dollar wealth, they are getting involved for the dream of a future for their children and grAnd children devoid of American oppression, murder and theft.
Sure, there are some great ideas out there and people everywhere will take part in all kinds of crypto projects, but every single one of them is dead in the water without Bitcoin being the final value layer, the central pillar so to speak.
It IS what makes Bitcoin special.

Futures are bits of paper betting in fiat on bitcoin price in fiat. It's irrelevant except to those that will lose a lot of fiat betting against bitcoin.
May as well be betting on a sports team. It don't affect the team much, just those that lose the bets.

I feel for you. I have a group of friends, did the same. 
They ALL got their info from social media and twitter.

My God, you are virtually proving that the decades long dumbing down agenda in Umerca has been effective.
I'm simply stating a well known fact that ALL republicans, neo-cons or otherwise and ALL democrats, socialist or otherwise ARE ON THE SAME TEAM. They ALL work for the same people.
There is no difference between them, the lot of em.
You had a chance there with Ron Paul a few years back, butcha all voted for some other sellout representing your team.
You've simply fallen for the big sell and chosen your team, in this case non neo-con republicans.

It seems correct. 
I guess part of me wants to believe the world's population will get it and through the silent revolution of choice, will privately adopt bitcoin.
So in effect, within me, this is already true. 
For me personally, It is my faith (as fickle as it is) in the world's population that is backing my hope that bitcoin is worth HODLing because people will eventually get this on a massive scale - that it could just end the power of central banks to create fake fiat out of thin air to wage fake endless wars of oppression.

Bitcoin is pseudo-nominous. It is up to the user if her addresses are attached to her identity or not. The point is, anonymity is possible. 
The real danger is if THEY manage to blockchain us before we blockchain them. 
Leaderless, decentralized, open source. These are important issues to keep afloat. ANY proposal that does NOT include these elements is designed to enslave you - permanently.
As exciting as bitcoin's potential to change things positively is; the blockchain, if not vigilantly understood, could really make the lame hollywood style dystopian future possible.
Vigilance HODL and constant vigilance

Kinda defeats the purpose of putting up an ad if you are on a site designed around putting up ads and you can't because they mean to sell your personally identifying info attached to your trading history AND the corresponding bitcoin addresses to whoever wants to pay for said data.
It is very disturbing.
And why the deception? It doesn't even make sense.
'Upload your private info so that we can protect you from identity theft possible with that very info.'
Does it even make sense? Can someone explain this logic (or lack of it) to me?

And as for 'people not caring about that'. - well, Maybe that's true in Umerca, but you people are so insanely programmed into an erroneous world view it would be funny if it weren't so tragic.

Just make sure you keep say 0.1 BTC and convince everyone you know to do the same and NEVER sell to fiat for any reason at all.
Then you are taking part in Bitcoin's global experiment to force the creation of money into transparency and quite possibly your 'investment' will pay off when we have real world peace with no fake fiat bankster wars.

My opinion on bitcoin stock? Never heard of it.
There's bitcoin the global currency which will inevitably become the global standard though. And for that, charts are silly.
They only reflect the trading of the ridiculously small amount that are available. It's not accurate. Most people I know HODLing will never sell to fiat even at 12 million per bitcoin.
This is not about increasing your fiat wealth. It's about securing a future without endless fake wars paid for with fake fiat.
@_date: 2018-05-13 03:48:05
Yes, it's hilarious. Remember, conbase is owned by banksters. They are not that interested in THEIR money, they have an endless supply from thin air.

It's more than funny. It's outright hilarious !!!!
@_date: 2018-05-14 04:20:32
Everything about crypto is odd. Get used to it.
There are people out there who would swap security and censorship resistance through leaderless open source decentralization FOR speed and cost through centralization, corporate leadership and closed source binaries eg. Bcash community.
Bitcoin is something else. No one knows how it will look and function, but what we do know is it will remain censorship and gov/corp resistant, decentralized, open source etc.
This IS what is important.

Marcion is correct. Bitcoin cannot and will not bendvto 'regulation'.
Although, you are correct anout companies not accepting bitcoin. We'll see the big corporations becoming undone because they are on gov welfare and are dependent on the fraudulent creation of money.
Smaller operators and mom pop companies will thrive.

@_date: 2018-05-19 23:38:18
I think you may be right.
Although there are already billions of dollars worth of bitcoin in the Iranian population, it is very unlikely that any of the citizens will sell their crypto to the iranian gov, which is oppressive to it's own people as well as scary to us outside.
The Iranian people bought bitcoin for the right reasons - to potentially end oppression, both by their leaders snd the evil Umercan empire.
They are true HODLers, they didn't 'invest' to sell each other out and get rich like all the AmeriCAN'Ts that jumped on bitcoin, late to the party since 2015.

I'm pretty sure this is a similar scam.
People selling miners are also SELLING bitcoin they've mined, NOT acquiring more, which is why they ask for fiat payment. Then they can HODL their mined coins and make their fiat commitments with fiat from machine sales.
It is very likely a BTC bucket shop.

Also, the newer narratives: it's a religion, it wastes energy, it IS the cause of global weirding. 
And the narrative EVERYONE has bought:  it's a digital asset that gets valued, bought and sold in fiat terms to try to increase one's fiat wealth. 
God forbid you should see it as open, transparent, leaderless, borderless, Permissionless, censorship resistant MONEY, that quite possibly has the potential to upend the status quo, which protects the handful (less than 8,000 people globally), who are above the rest of us as they control the creation of Money.
Instead we waste our rime with dumb discussions on 'investing' and ROI and getting rich and yady yada...

California is also the center of the dumbing down phenomena. Swiss people pride themselves in being smart. It is cool to be smart, to be open minded, to study, to think critically.
In California unfortunately, it is cool to be stupid, even 'let's get retarded', full of phonies, insecurity at an all time high for humanity, opinionated, and lamestrem media narrative controlled.
In Switzerland, it is common to hear young people discussing philosophy and literature, exercising creative and original thought. In california, you hardly ever hear an original thought, just crap repeated from some perceived cool authority.

Back in the day when Bitcoin was a novelty, the ONLY thing a noob cared about was this IDEA that bitcoin is LEADERLESS and not Owned by anyone. No patents, no corporation, not even an identity to the author of the white paper.
It is what got our attention in the first place. 
ALL of the alt coins would not have come along AND if they had, they would have been shut down or absorbed by the big boys so quick it would have made your head spin. 
But that's not the point. The fact that they are NOT leaderless would have made them uninteresting, they would be just another digital form of centralized money creation like paypal. There is no way that a committed community would have grown around ANY crypto. It simply would not have caught anyones attention.
It is because there is no patent, no corporation, no centralized point that early enthusiasts (we were not adopters yet, bitcoin had no value) became interested.

Yes. When bitcoin forked, you had 2 chains left, one was bitcoin and the other bcash. Say you had 2 bitcoin before fork, after fork you'd have the same amount on both forks, in this case 2 Bitcoin and 2 bcash. There have been many forks since then that you'd have as well, bitcoin gold, bitcoin diamond etc. checkout r/bitcoin_airdrops. As the blockchain wallet supports bcash (no other airdrops), it is quite easy to just send them to an exchange that supports bcash and trade them to real bitcoin.
Hope this was helpful, i've only got a minute right now. If you need more help, let me know. But there's plenty of info out there on it.

There is no theory. Quite the opposite. The 'institutional investors' now understand the HODL wall. It scares the shit out of them. The vast majority of bitcoin will NEVER be traded back to fiat.
Real HODLers will still have their bitcoin if it goes to zero or when it is ubiquitous and they can spend it directly without fiat interference.
The only real path is to buy as much as you can afford to regularly with the mind that you are investing in a possible future without fake fiat paid wars. End of story.
Stop trying to get rich in fiat terms already.

You are correct. The whole fiasco, starting with 'the block size debate' was a corporate bankster led attempt at divide and conquer. The good news, with the USAF 'we, the people' won. Their old tired strategies of controlling the narrative failed, they - the corporations behind the supposed NY 'agreement' - were incensed that the people should have the power to win. They took a risk, forked the chain full of their own egos believing that their money and influence and shill army could make bcash the true bitcoin.
That too was a miserable failure.
Come to today - now - their egos still won't let go of old ideas and narratives, they try desperately hard to hold onto the gullible people they scammed through appealing to greed (the flippening promise) and blindly continue on without any clarity.
I like to think that this is possibly the first case in human history where their divide and conquer strategy failed and continues to fail. 
The whole community - on all sides should be proud of this.

Remember, this has nothing to do with Umerca and your greedy outlook. The rest of the planet is ahead and sees bitcoin as a way to free themselves of the evil empire.
Instead of arguing with someone who's been through many decades of watching this nightmare you think is normal take root, just humour me and get on board.

Up to you. Outside of Umerca, that is definitely not the case. Have you ever noticed that it is easier to sell bitcoin to people than it is to buy it from them?
Businesses are no different. Granted that may not be the case in Umerca. But Umerca is irrelevant, as the only country that would stand to lose if the world went off the dollar standard to bitcoin standard, would in fact be Umerca !!!

Miner centralization is the problem. Bcash is a classic example, where ALL of the miners are controlled by one man, there is a corporation formed around it and the whole effort is paid for by JP Morgan. This is damaging and in time as people realize this and that a fair decentralized leaderless currency is the way to go, they'll realize they bought the hype about bcash and the PR which is paid for and touted from an army of paid shills.
Any alt coin going this route will fail.
Ultimately, people will gravitate to sound money.
The 'core devs' are a diverse group of trusted talented devs that are themselves reviewed by the wider dev community. This is possible is a true open source project like Bitcoin BECAUSE a 'core group' of talented committed individuals emerges from a vast array of contributors. Again, bcash is a classic example of starting off on the wrong foot because the leaders behind bcash had only financial and power hungry motives behind them, thereby stopping ANY development which you could call open source contribution.

It seems you have bought the lame stream media bankster narrative that bitcoin is some kind of 'digital asset' that you buy and sell like stock to increase your fiat wealth.
That narrative is simply untrue.
What scares THEM the most is that bitcoin may actually BECOME the currency that IS the final settlement layer determining the price of ALL currencies. It simply means that THEY can no longer print money out of thin air to throw fake bankster wars.
Bitcoin is leaderless and no, you do NOT NEED a third party to facilitate transactions. It may seem like it, but That is just part of the growing pains, where we are at now, with many people (but not most) using exchanges to buy bitcoin with fiat. A little while ago ALL bitcoin/fiat trades were OTC.
It is important to be able to transact without a third party so that that third party does NOT have the power to decide who may or may not engage in trade. There is a mountain of info on this everywhere. Look into it, it is the fine line between freedom, self determination and slavery.
Please please please consider this idea and learn to understand history and the true importance of this facility.

It's kinda ip to you to do the study. 
Check out the sticky at the top of this sub. Go through the whole thing including all links. At that point you have a bitcoin education. You'll understand it. That being said, bitcoin is constantly evolving and no one REALLY knows what it is.
Look up Andreas Antonopolous on youtube and watch everything he ever said. He's one of the the geeks who put all this into understandable englsh for us.
Stay away from bitcoin.com as it has been compromised by bad actors spreading lies and scams.
Bitcoin itself is a currency, an asset, a store of value etc
It is not a scam. 
But Being a cashlike currency however, makes it useful for people running scams, just like physical cash is good for scammers to scam others with. The media is full of these stories.
BCH is one of these scams. It is a fork of bitcoin (you'll learn what a fork is in your study), which has only the self interests of the creators at heart and abandons the most important part of the bitcoin technology - securing the network to keep it leaderless and uncontrollable by any one group or even nation/state. Bitcoin itself has no known creators. Again, you'll learn what we do know of Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator, but he gave it away - it is an unowned or community owned open source project where anyone can contribute - even you, if you have or develop the necessary skills.
ALL other 'crypto currencies' or alt coins have creators and management teams. BCH, officially named Bitcoin cash, but is commonly referred to as bcash to avoid confusion. There are many of these forks or versions of bitcoin. Even you could fork bitcoin and have your own version to name whatever you wish.
Welcome to bitcoin, may your journey be mind opening and life changing as it has ben for so many of us.
One more important point. The main stream media is still by and large clueless. Take whatever you hear from the talking heads with a bucket of salt. They have simply not done the study I recommend.
Also, the sticky at the top of this sub is gold. A powerful information source. The thread on the other hand is pretty lame. Best avoided for now. 
Because of bitcoin's popularity and world changing potential, it steps on many toes, especially central banks, commercial banks, wall st and governments. As a result a massive sybil attack is constantly in force by shills paid by these actors to spread misinformation and disinformation on this sub reddit. Be wary of most things you read here until you have developed your own understanding of this truly remarkable phenomena.

Obviously the difference can't fit into your lamestream programmed brain.
I'll try again.
Hoarding is when you hoard something that you personally value for whatever reason, thinking it will make or keep you rich later on.
HODLing is holding onto Bitcoin specifically because you can see the potential for bitcoin to completely rewrite what we call money and become the final settlement layer for ALL value BECAUSE it is the first leaderless money we have ever had.
If someone is holding bitcoin to get rich, you are correct, that person is also hoarding.
But HODLers hold on so that the incumbent scum can't buy it with their self created fake fiat and screw up that possibility of a thousand years of world peace by selling each other out again and just turn bitcoin into some kind of 'digital asset'.
The HODL is extremely important. 
Bitcoin is spreading out into the hands of normal people world wide through HODLers, while the incumbent fiat hoarders are freaking out.
It seems you may be one of the latter.
You are welcome to join the right side of history at any point, but be prepared that your mind AND your narrow world view will change.

Good luck finding 'large amounts' of bitcoin available for fiat exchange from day to day.
The volume of bitcoin being 'traded' daily is far below 5% of the mined coins.
The rest are HODLed for the day bitcoin is ubiquitous.
HODL on folks, the HODL wall is getting stronger every day.
Don't let the 'price' on exchanges based on this small percentage of coins available for fiat exchange fool you.
There is no 'price' high enough to be even marginally interesting to true HODLers compared to being part of changing history, removing the power of central banks to print money out if thin air and wage endless fake wars and entering a thousand years of peace and prosperity.

Again, the greater fool thing is just a lamestream bankster narrative created just for bitcoin. It's bullshit, there is no such thing. They don't use it to refer to stocks etc.
Remember, bitcoin scares the shit out if them. 
They want you to believe that bitcoin is something that you 'invest' fiat in as some kind of 'digital asset' to increase your fiat wealth, like ANY other investment.
Whereas, the truth is that Bitcoin is the first tool we - common people - have ever had to collectively shift the ability to create money out of thin air by a select few to pay for fake endless wars, to a fair transparent system of money that we can all trust.
God forbid we all 'get it'.

This is not a political or ideological discussion, or at leadt it shouldn't be, THAT would just be a reflection of the conversation participant's bad programming and inability to actually think.
You see, When one group of people are privileged and live by a different set of rules to the rest of us, we NEED some way to 'regulate' them because as we know, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
Bitcoin is run on enforcing CONSENSUS rules completely transparently. It needs no regulation.
Central banks create billions out of thin air every single day, without ANY oversight at all.
Do you see the difference. Or are you still in some kind of Bernaysian programmed brain fart?

Look around. Find an average person under 30 who's even seen a cli. For the folks over 50, they all had to use cli to some degree before windoze came out. They may only know how to do clickyclick now, but at least they KNOW how a computer works. 
I have kids in that age group. Yes, they don't really like computers, but when they were at grade school, they had to learn machine code and logic. They had to write file system - now known as an operating system. The logic that runs behind every corporate clickyclick, they uderstand, even the code may be alien to them as they haven't touched computers in that way since school. 
I also have grand kids who are millennials to whom I had to explain that the www is just an application running on 'the internet'. Yet, they are considered computer savvy because they know where to click on badly designed sites like fb or use goooogle devices. When they had 'computer class' they were learning where to click on shitty corporate programs like microsoft office or how to work out aspect ratio on a vdo, color correction on photoshop. Not a single class on logic, programming or coding. Even dumbed down systems like visual basic weren't even touched on. This is all by design.
I'm sorry if this seems alien to you, but the vast majority haven't got a clue AND it is all part of the dumbing down agenda, along with the like button, hiphop and 'getting fucked up'.

An unbelievably stupid idea being pushed by banksters onto the entire world's population, where they try to make it sound like it is normal to get all the information you can about your customer instead of just selling your product or service to them.
Everyone is taking their narrative lying down as if it is normal to spy on each other on behalf of evil organizations which are very very far from transparent.
Imagine 60 years ago, a guy wants to buy your tractor. Did you say, 'hey, what's your ID, where'd you get this money? What kind of business are you in?' Etc

I just transferred all my BTC out and at midnight on July 25, I will close my account for good.

There's heaps of 'free' services for making payments. It's why it is silly trying to compete with that, like bcash is purporting to be attempting. For speed of transactions and cheap transactions, you can't compete with centralized fake money from the legacy fiat system. Their plan of course is to rope everyone into the IDEA of making transactions ONLY through a third party, then they'll bend you over and insert.
We've seen it all before thousands of times throughout history.
Bitcoin is a choice to exit that fraudulent system and build a world without endless wars. To be able to transact directly without a third party in between. This is vitally important, way beyond any 'convenience'.
It is a choice: be a sellout and pander to the man, or hold your ground and tell the man to take a walk, we don't need em.
Each of us need to make this decision for ourselves. It happens inside of us.
Follow your conscience.

Well, if you happen to have BTC and don't want to get more into debt on a credit card, then there's that reason. And then there's just good old fashioned buying stuff and all, you know, directly, without a third party, but I guess that's not a good reason.

There is a very clear difference between a ponzi pyramid scheme and a legit MLM company which actually moves product. Eg, amway
I find it hard to work out if bitclub is a ponzi or legit, so I am going with ponzi.

Looks like an elaborate ponzi closer to bitconnect than a legit organization like amway, whose been moving environmentally friendly products for a few generations now.

Seems you've bought the corporate line.
However, ALL corporations HAVE to prioritize the profit of their shareholders over all other issues BY LAW. Whatever their PR, branding and marketing is, is irrelevant.
The wright brothers, tesla were not corporations, in fact tesla came undone BECAUSE of corporate mentality.
Gooogle is simple evil. 'Don't be evil' still presupposes that evil WILL be done, just like if I ask you NOT to imagine a pink elephant, you will imagine a pink elephant. The overlords behind goooogle know this, otherwise they would have said 'be benevolent'.
Are you not aware of the Snowden revelations, vault 7 etc.

I'd love to, but haven't got too much time to do so. The information is out there in vast quantities. Maybe start by watching an entertaining cartoon called 'money as debt'
In short, if you were to borrow $50 from me, I would actually have to be in possession of the $50.
Banks are not bound by this. When someone 'borrows' from a bank, the actual application form itself - the piece of paper - becomes worth the amount of money being borrowed. It becomes a promissory note - a promise to pay. It doesn't stop there. The interesting part is that through the magic (or illusion) of fractional reserve banking, the bank then creates up to 33 times the amount of the original note for itself in digital 'money'.
Oddly enough, it gets even wierder when collections of these promissory notes are bundled and 'sold on' as derivatives. That gets funky fast.
Again, that's a short synopsis. Check out the cartoon and go from there.
Good luck, you are about to enter a rabbit hole of bizarreness that no one around you will believe until they take the time to study up for themselves.
Careful not to get too upset at this state of affairs as you now have access to a tool to finish this wholesale fraud once and for all. It's called bitcoin.
HODL 0.1 BTC forever, until you can spend it directly for goods and services. Convince everyone around you to do the same. In this way we are electing to exit this fraudulent system - simply by placing our 'value' in money that is created transparently and fairly and consistently by US.
Fiat = THEIR fake money based on someone else's debt and misery.
Bitcoin = OUR money based on proof of work and reward for securing the ledger of transactions.
Peace brother.

You got it bro !!!
I spend my time trying to be the guy that comes up with the Bitcoin killer app idea, instead of caring about the 'price'.
@_date: 2018-05-21 18:09:16
The 'price' is determined by buy and sell pressure on that price. In bitcoin, it is an illusion. The vast majority - more than 96% of bitcoin - is not available for sale on these 'exchanges', so the real value is way way over what you've ever seen on any chart.
The best bet is to buy what you can afford as a sort of savings and think of it as investing in a potential future where central banks don't have the power to create money out of thin air to pay for endless wars and fake terrorism.
That is worth much more than just being a rich guy because in that world, most people will be 'rich'.
Join the HODL wall and NEVER sell back to fiat, especially on an 'exchange'. Instead, just keep saving up, waiting for the day where it is easy to pay for your goods and services in bitcoin - our money, not THEIR fake money.
Ignore the charts, it's ALL an illusion. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 04:12:37
Buy in small amounts that you can afford to lose. NEVER sell back to fiat - especially on some bankster owned exchange like conbase.
It is an investment in a potential future where banksters can't throw fake wars paid for in their fake fiat. It is NOT an investment in any other way shape or form. If you believe it is, you've simply swallowed their narrative that ultimately everything HAS to be Valued in fiat terms. 
The truth is, that fiat value will ultimately be determined in Bitcoin. This is inevitable.
Just have to get everyone who is interested in having a peaceful thousand years, to put $20 a week into the first solution that has EVER presented itself to mankind to get out from under THEIR thumb - Bitcoin.
The power is with us - people. Worldwide. This is NOT an Umercan phenomena. It is global. People everywhere waking up to the idea that playing a tiny role in the HODL just might secure us a peaceful world.

To some degree. What we really need is for people to demand payment in bitcoin, not the other way around,!where we are waiting for corporate sellouts to 'start accepting' bitcoin.
If we all demand payment for our personal goods or services or even time, if you have a job, then that value has already been created and transferred in bitcoin without fiat interface. We charge in bitcoin, not convert from dollars to establish a price. Talk to your landlord,!your local CSA farmer, local mom pop shop, barber, plumber etc to accept bitcoin. If you really need to use a corporation, spend it and replace it immediately by 'buying with fiat' so as to keep your balance in bitcoin always slowly increasing a few satoshi at a time..

My serious thoughts are:
How long have you been here? Are you looking at the technology and the expansion of the space from people and companies investing fiat wealth into it?
Or are you just looking at the price?
Bitcoin is not and never has been something you should buy with fiat in order to one day 'make a return' in fiat.
That is the narrative the overlords are trying to have us all believe.
The truth is that if we simply buy $100 of bitcoin and forget about it and talk to everyone we know about doing the same, in time everyone will have wealth in bitcoin, albeit a small amount. Most people don't have $100 disposable in their bank account. At this point, it makes sense to just trade bitcoin between us REAL people and decrease the amount of times you us THEIR fake money.
This brings the banks and corporations to their knees.
The world changes. Bitcoin becomes the final value settlement layer for everything.
Fake wars - paid for in fake fiat created out if thin air by the most ruthless dumbed down idiots in human history - cease to be a problem.
2 generations down the road people will wonder why we put up with it fir so long.
Forget the 'price', it is an illusion. The price is determined by what people are willing to pay for bitcoin on exchanges.
It is an insignificant amount of bitcoin in the liquidity pool.
The vast majority are HODLed by people who get this.
Join the HODL wall. NEVER sell back to fiat - especially on an exchange. Be part of the change you wish to see. It's a hundred bucks.

And you can't do math. I said I am in my ninth decade, not my hundredth. Seems your cognitive capabilities are somewhat diminished. Take this into consideration when you are communicating with someone you could learn something from.
Just growing some pot, is no stance. It's a sellout taking advantage of a black market to lord it over their fellow smoker.
Moving to a 'free state', well if you firmly believe that's the case, then you really have bought the narrative. And you have provided more proof of your own inability to think originally, that you are in fact one of the dumbed down.

Seems none of you were around for 2013 grandiose high of 1,168 dollars. Many HODLed through that and still do. You see, even when the fake fiat price of the 19,000 dollars were reached, we still HODLed on.
If you are in this to enrich your fiat wealth, you deserve to get stung by your own greed. Real HODLers NEVER sell at ANY price.
Just keep buying what you CAN AFFORD TO LOSE.
HODLers are on the right side of history. End of story.
@_date: 2018-05-18 17:19:25
I'm sorry if the concept won't fit into your brain. 
The point is to HODL until bitcoin is ubiquitous, where you spend it and receive it INSTEAD of fiat.
If it goes to zero, at least you did your part.
HODLing separates the men from the boys or the true-to-themselves and the sellouts.
You simply decide which you are.
Then you use the word 'HODL' or the word 'hold' depending on what you are actually doing, knowing that they mean different things.
This lame stream narrative that HODL is just a cute bitcoin thing meaning 'hold and sell later' is just that - a lame stream bankster narrative.

By calculating back to bitcoin coinmarketcap's estimated fiat daily volume (which really should be shown in bitcoin by now), and assuming every dollar spent on a bitcoin which is not traded again in that 24 hour period, less than 5% of mined coins (14 million - taking into account satoshi's million and lost coins) are available for fiat sale.
Meanwhile HODLers are constantly acquiring more as they can afford to. In time the super rich, who will only become interested when they can park the equivalent value of 100,000,000 USD in a bitcoin, will have to compete with all HODLers for ONLY the freshly mined coins.
Then it becomes interesting.
Stop looking at the illusion of exchange driven 'price'.
Bitcoin is far more important than just increasing your fiat wealth by 'investing' in it like you would in some lame stock like berkshire hathaway. Stock is NOT the first leaderless and transparent currency that EVERYONE can trust, in all of human history.

You sound like the classic sellout that has NEVER had the balls to take a stance.
FYI, I could probably be your father. I am in my ninth decade now. I've seen a few things in that time.
Unfortunately, What I've seen the most of is: dumbed down sell outs misunderstanding EVERYTHING and selling each other out for apparent personal gain AND ignorant idiots who just repeat what they are told to repeat by their lame stream media as if they had a brain and any capability for original thought.
Looks like you are already missing out on 'getting it' due to your need to try to classify people exercising original thought into the basket THEY have laid out for you to put those people into. Of course you vehemently believe that you have your 'opinion' (you believe it is YOUR opinion afterall) and that it matters so much. 
Whereas, instead if maybe learning something from an old fart whose been through it, your programming has forced you to put me into the 'tin foil hat kid living in his mom's basement' box. How convenient, now you can safely move on about your day believing your erroneous beliefs as if they were actually yours to begin with. Not threatened by the truth or the idea that maybe YOU could have an important role to play.

So the 11 million odd coins being HODLed worldwide are irrelevant.
Look, just because the whole population of Umerca has bought the bankster's lamestream line that bitcoin is some kind of digital asset that you 'invest' fiat in for potential fiat returns, does not mean that the rest of the planet believes that drivel.
In Japan, people buy bitcoin as they can afford it, HODLing it until the day bitcoin is ubiquitous, to spend bitcoin, not to convert back to fiat. 
In Iran, there's probably more bitcoin than in Umerca. 
They bought in big quantities in a wave that went through in 2012, because they could see that their hundred dollars was part of 'investing in' a potential future where Umerca can't print fake money to pay for fake wars and rain bombs down on their grand children.
Your worldview is Americ-centric. Umerca hasn't been important for more than a generation now. You are known as a nation of misled dumbed down idiots that can't think for themselves and put up with ridiculous amounts of economic oppression.
Yes, to an Umercan, it's about getting rich quick by 'investing', to the rest of us, it is our chance to destroy the idea of the UD dollar being the world currency, bing down the evil empire and usher in a thousand years of peace.

Ask to be paid in BTC. 
The people you have to pay regularly, set them up with a bitcoin wallet. Send them a small amount. See if they'd be happy taking 10% of your payment in BTC.
If you can (and I did this with my landlord), make your payment as per normal, but also send them the following month's payment in BTC in advance. Ask them to hold onto it as a sort of experiment you'd like to run where when it is up in value from the payment you have to make in fiat, 'buy' that amount back by getting that amount of bitcoin back from them to the fiat value of the payment you are making. 
In my case, The market was moving up at the time so on that first month he saw a gain in value. She immediately saw it and was more than happy to take bitcoin at that point. Even with the 'downturn' now, she's happy as can be taking bitcoin, in fact she prefers it in a downturn because she gets more btc.

Every HODLer counts.
We ARE the HODL wall.
The reason real estate has value is because the vast majority is not on the market. This is the same at this stage if the game with bitcoin.
NEVER sell back to fiat, just spend and replace with others who will never sell back to fiat.
If everyone would just HODL 0.1 BTC or 10 million Satoshi, the crooks on wall st will have to compete with each other and US to acquire Bitcoin ONLY from the freshly mined coins, because the rest of the coins are no longer available fir fiat exchange.
At this point less than 5% of available coins are going around and around on the exchanges, creating an illusion of 'the price' of bitcoin. 
A future where central banks do NOT have the power to create money out of thin air and thus endless fake wars is worth so much more than any fiat 'price' you'll ever see on ANY exchange.

Marxism has nothing to do with what Karl Marx - the sociologist - wrote.
Marx simply stated that the obvious next step in social development after the industrial revolution would be when the proletariat (those who do NOT own the means of production) would rise up and become the owners if the means of production. It just hasn't happened yet.
It is however happening.
Through ICO we will see the common person owning part of the means of production by holding and trading tokens.
This is NOT marxism, but it is moving towards the obvious next step that Karl wrote about.

It means a big evil corporation has approved itself to trade fake paper valued in US dollars betting on the real bitcoin price.
It means that THEY are having to take the force of bitcoin growth and adoption seriously, but foolishly and arrogantly thinking they can do so on their own ground in their own playing field independent of THE MARKET.
Silly suits. Dumbed down privileged fools who have never contributed a single thing or a single moment to the greater good or the greater hood.
They'll convince upper middle class Umercan 'investors' to bet against bitcoin because 'it is in a bubble' and take the fiat off of all those that trust 'their financial judgement'. The usual big business eats the little guy bullshit.
Bitcoin will continue along without a care in the world about those fake futures contracts valued in the fiat currencies it is slowly replacing.

When a Bitcoin costs $100,000 - it'll only cost us 1,000 Satoshi to buy a single USD.
This is the correct way to think of it.
If I had the time and patience, I would make a website tracking the prices of all fiat currencies as well as stock in lame corporations like Hathaway calculated in Satoshi.
For example:
At 8,100
648 Satoshi for a Mexican Peso.
371 Satoshi for a Thai Baht
243 Satoshi for a Philippine Peso
119 Satoshi per Nepalese Rupee 
110 Satoshi for Japanese Yen.
 9.04 Satoshi for a Myanmar Kyat
0.91 Satoshi for an Indonesian Rupiah
0.54 Satoshi for a Vietnamese Dong.
IT TAKES 2 VIET DONG TO BUY A SNGLE SATOSHI !!!!
Hathaway  2.4M Satoshi or 0.024320988 bitcoin
Apple 2.3M Satoshi or 0.0232309 bitcoin
NASDAQ 109,726,361 Satoshi or 1.09762361 bitcoin
NYSE  157,407,407M Satoshi or 1.57407407 bitcoin
It is time we reversed the narrative and WE the community value and buy and sell shit - even fiat currencies or stock from the perspective of Bitcoin.
Valuing good money in bad money is ridiculous.

Silly lame stream trying to change the narrative.
There is no FODL.
They are trying to make it sound cute that you just change the spelling, but the meaning is the same: you either hold or fold.
Whereas HODL means you'll NEVER sell back to fiat. 
That idea scares them. They want their bitcoin too !!!! Have to make people sell.
If we plan to fold at some point, we are not HODLing, we are holding.
If we are constantly buying bitcoin with money we can afford to lose, investing in a potential future without wars and oppression, knowing full well we may lose it all, but NEVER selling back to fiat, then we are HODLing.
There is a big difference. Kill the lame stream narrative.
Bitcoin is NOT a fiat investment to increase your fiat wealth. It is an international people's take over of the fraudulent legacy financial system. That IS the investment.
The HODL army is strong. 
Let the privileged scum compete with each other and US (a lot of US) for ONLY the freshly mined coins.
The HODL wall goes up in value, but holds strong.
@_date: 2018-05-10 03:05:42

Besides that, paying even 1 cent to a gov which uses it to murder, oppress and thieve globally is immoral.
You Umercans claim to be Christian, yet you support murder and theft through your taxes. You are complicit.

Umerca is where the brain dead live who have no imagination and think that hiphop is music. You know, the land of the slave, home of the fee. I'm sure you've heard of it. They are ignorant as fuck and will argue with you till they are blue in the face protecting their limited and erroneous world view.  Reddit is full of them.
Nothing at all is stopping the incumbents replacing their fiat with crypto and believe me, unlike you, they ain't wasting their time arguing about it, they are starting to DO  it.
The point is they can only do it at the same rate as the rest of us. There simply is NEVER a billion dollars worth of crypto available at any one point. And besides that is strawmaning the issue.
It is not about rich people jumping on board. 
It IS however, about removing the power of the uber-rich bankster class to create money out of thin air and then use it to pay sellouts to oppress and murder people world wide in their fake wars.

Oh yes it does.
If you are buying, planning on selling later, then you are holding bitcoin. Just like holding a stock.
If you are in this for the big picture - to permanently destroy the ability for a select group of people to create money out of thin air to pay for fake wars - then you HODL.
I recommend you HODL say 0.1 BTC. Spend and replace about 0.05 BTC and hold some bitcoin for fiat profit later on - maybe the largest part of your 'investment'.

@_date: 2018-05-18 18:13:17
Nice try, but no flaw.
This mindset works. It increases your spending power.
The 'price' is short hand for the price in dollars, nothing more, nothing less.
I prefer the price to be more accurate. A USD would cost me 12,000 Satoshi at the moment because that may be the place I need to make the purchase.
However if I am in Zimabwe, my actual real cost in Satoshi moves down rapidly. 
Me personally? 
When I try to purchase a good or service in BTC, I pay what I think the item or service is worth to me in Satoshi and the seller of the good or service tells me what they want and we actually talk about it like humans have done for millenia. As in, how much work and effort do I personally have to put in to acquire the Satoshi that I spent, back?
Vice versa for the seller. What's it worth to them, like really, not just some arbitrary number based on some fiat currency from the other side of the planet representing an evil empire that bitcoin promises to end. 
I find that currently, people are happy to get their hands on some in the first place. I upload a wallet for them, have them store the seed and transfer the BTC. Usually the conversation is actually about doing our tiny little part to end Umercan imperialism.
@_date: 2018-05-19 03:01:35
For a short while that'll be the case until it becomes normal to value fiat in bitcoin terms. Then it becomes crazy to do so, kinda like if I was basing my value proposition based in Zimbabwe currency today, i'd be recalculating too often.
it'll be easier just to go with Satoshi.
In fact, being all in on BTC, I am very aware of the fact that it costs me 12,000 Satoshi per fiat dollar, where a few months ago I could get one for less than 5,000.
So in effect, I do this already.

Anonymity is very important, not only to protect ourselves, but to protect everyone else. I'm glad you get it. 
Far too many people have taken on the "I've got nothing to hide" narrative and THAT just empowers THEM.
The only reason the catholic church was able to lock down Europe in 7 centuries of 'dark ages' is because they knew everything about what everyone was doing and thinking through their confessional, yet the people knew nothing at all about what THEY were doing and thinking.
We are entering the dark ages again, in a way, where everyone will keep their head down so as not to be singled out. It is through our loss of privacy and anonymity while THEY are all about secretive anonymous actions.
While the watchers know everything about us, We know nothing about the watchers. In this way they control the narrative and are able to pit neighbors against neighbors, divide and conquer.
Bitcoin is here to fuck up their plan, yet we allow OUR P2P trading platform yo be compromised.
Just a few days ago before I deleted my account, I posted to the forum about this state of affairs and was swamped with brainless repeaters saying 'what have you got to hide'' and other nonsense sticking up for their oppressors. And then the thread was frozen !!!!
It is scary that we may lose what we have with bitcoin because the brainwashed sheep are unable to get it.

Crusading is a vital part of this space. It is a new space and ONLY our vigilance will guide it. Otherwise the same sellouts will still be pulling your strings.
I have already removed myself from the 'service', don't you worry about that.
Understanding people are busy in life and used to just clicking the updated terms without looking further it is actually my civic duty to alert unsuspecting others to the fraud.
By the way, did you think about what I wrote?
Do you not find it odd that they feel they have to commit fraud and lie to you that they NEED your personal data to 'protect you from identity theft', when in fact they intend to sell your data on to whoever would like it - including your trading history?
Are you not alarmed by this deceptive ploy?
Doesn't some bell go off in your head that says, 'wait a minute....  That makes no sense'?
Do you have a pulse?
Please, I know we are all busy, but let's slow down for a second and THINK instead of immediately reacting to come to the rescue of the victimized corporation.

@_date: 2018-05-19 15:02:05
You are right. I meant at a rate relative to what each person can afford to lose.
So the price would get bid ip instead of down like with the gold and silver markets.
These goons don't game it right? 
They just buy and sell like the rest if us, right?
With all their power and influence and access to easy money, they just buy and 'hope' it goes up, right?
The 'price' going down amidst all this adoption and billions being sunk into crypto infrastructure is just further proof of the beginning if their involvement.
The 'price' which you are so concerned with is an illusion.
Buy and HODL while it's cheap.
HODL 0.1 which you never sell back to fiat, get others who you respect to do the same and you're doing your part instead of confusing yourself still stuck in old paradigm thinking. Maybe you aught to reread my original post with an open mind and see if you can fit it in ;)

Contrary to the bankster lamestream narrative that HODL is just a cutsy bitcoiner meme that means hold, it actually means HODL till bitcoin is what we spend in our daily lives in return for goods or services, where bitcoin is the deciding value layer for ALL currencies.
It means NEVER sell back to fiat for ANY reason at all.

I did check it out. It's got binaries in it.
Exchanges are complicit with the banksters backing the whole NYA, segwitX2, bcash fiasco, so they do what they do. Sellouts do what they do.
I am talking about the colloquial use of the word bcash to refer to the centralized alt coin bitcoin fork.
Maybe not in Umerca, but the rest of the world simply calls it bcash. These are normal users, often non-english speaking who want to use language that won't confuse others. They don't care if the implementation the miners and nodes are running is ABC, unlimited, bcash, bcoin etc.
They are clueless in this regard. They just know bcash is a failed bankster attempt to take over the bitcoin network with a centralized version THEY can control. We laugh at it.
It's fun watching all THEIR old tricks, like divide and conquer, finally begin to fail.

Nice try at the HODLing is hoarding narrative, but fail.
Hoarding is hoarding. HODLing is HODLing.
2 very distinct activities, one of them firmly within the current matrix, the other, a method to exit the current matrix.
I've seen this mew narrative a few times over the past few days. It's almost as silly as the 'bitcoin causes global warming morphed to uses too much electricty - as much as Ireland - a single transaction more than a suburban house' narrative.
They really are reaching. Please don't be fooled by all the bankster lamestream media narratives and Please please don't waste your time repeating them onwards.
You'd be better off just HODLing until BTC is ubiquitous.
It does mean the end of endless fake bankster wars.
And that is a reason to HODL, but a terrible reason to hoard.

Maybe it's time we practiced KYS
Know Your Seller or even better Know Your Sellout.
Why do we, normal law abiding citizens agree to these draconian one sided measures. Let's push for ANYONE enforcing silly KYC/AML regulations (they are NOT laws), has to provide you with full data on themselves. The actual names and addresses of the management and shareholders as well as the low level employees who are complicit and directly involved with your own particular case.
The actual living breathing individuals involved.
Please please please, let's consider pushing for this. And pushing HARD.
KYC/AML, if it exists at all, should be a two way street, not a one way street.
We as citizens have a right to know who is asking us for our personal info, who exactly gets to see it and who exactly has access to it. The individuals, not just some entity.
This includes all people and all people working in ALL organizations public and private (not least of all, the sellouts at the NSA) who are privy to our personal records.
We NEED to know who they are, where they live, what THEIR gov ID info is AND their financial data AND the true source of their funds.
We are not asking for anything that THEY are not asking from us.
It's only fair.

1 - if you are that company's 'customer', where you actually exchange money for goods and services AND they are bound by their statutory laws to demand this of you, their hands are tied. They are in the same boat as you - their CUSTOMER. In order to continue to operate, they must comply.
2 - None of us are a localbitcoins 'customer' by sheer definition of the word. None of us has ever paid them directly for goods or services.
3 - if the apparent other company feels it is necessary to commit fraud and lie to you that they NEED your personal sensitive ID in order to somehow 'protect you from identity theft', then they should be boycotted. It is deceptive AND fraudulent.
4 - it really is up to you to slow down for a second and understand THIS: it is your bitcoin trade history that they mean to match with your goooogle metadata set. If you really are comfortable with that information being sold and shared on with ANYONE in the market for such information, then by all means, continue arguing with me.
Why wait?
Why don't you just publish all of your private info, your gov ID, all your metadata (available from gooooogle), your trade history AND the bitcoin addresses those funds were sent to right here and right now?
Why? Because NO ONE is comfortable with THAT, yet what is happening IS in effect, just that.

Paypal not volatile ?!?!?
Maybe for us white countries, but try to explain that to a paypal user in venezuela, zimbabwe etc.
Their paypal fluctuates very widely for them personally as it is a fiat interface for whatever fiat currency the bank account you collect your paypal to.
It's all relative.
In my opinion it is the dollar that fluctuates, as what I have to pay for dollars changes constantly.
Over the past 8 months, I paid anywhere between 5,000 and 25,000 Satoshi for a dollar on any given day. Ridiculously unstable from my perspective, but I at least am willing to accept that that is simply MY perspective, possibly not shared with many others.

This is simply not true. I spent a lot of time over the last 6 decades in 'third world countries', where the governments were far to poor to effectively tax people. By and large, they had community, people got along and smiled genuinely through out life. They didn't have a fridge, car OR tv. But they had freedom and non-materialistic views on life , which delivered real joy.
These places were far safer than the white world and safer than they are now as emergent or already emerged economies.  Taxes allow a government to get rich and oppress it's people, personal safety and respect for each other becomes a dim memory.
In every single case, that is what actually happens.

IGNORANCE and disinformation leading people to believe that Bitcoin is some kind of asset that you 'invest' in to increase your fiat wealth.
This narrative/mindset will rob people of the opportunity.
Example - the cripploff scam. Designed by bankers to divest people of bitcoin in return for fake digital 'money'.
But the Bitcoin with money you can afford to lose and keep buying it.
Remember that Bitcoin is not an 'investment', but rather the valuation layer that will decide ALL values of Everything including fake fiat and alt coins.

First of all, eating more beef is how we beat climate change. Look up Alan Savory TED talk.
It is grass fed beef and the way industrial cattle farming is managed that causes them to release methane as they are not designed to eat a diet that has suck a low carbon to nitrogen ratio.
Grass fed beef that are mob grazing do not release the methane as grass has a high carbon to nitrogen ratio. If they mob graze, they literally cause perennial grasses to reestablish on desert edges causing prairies to recover the desert edge.
Also, as we know the main problem causing global weirding is corporatism, which is dependent on a fraudulent financial system based on debt.
Bitcoin has the potential to obliterate central banking AND corporatism, thereby erasing the HUGE environmental footprint caused by the financial system itself, not even including the devastating effects of corporations - who's life blood is fake fiat created out of thin air by the select dumbed down few.

I live in countries where the crypto space is thriving and alive. I don't do media. I am aware that the media uses the official name. I'm not talking about media, I'm talking about common people speaking to each other.
I'm talking about normal people you meet. No one calls it bitcoin cash as it is too confusing. Even people who use it to transact, they don't want people to confuse the value amount or the address to send to, so they call it bcash. 
It does have a better ring to it. For people who speak limited english or english as a second language, it is just simpler and sounds cool. Bitcoin cash is a mouthful and can confuse people. When money is concerned, people are diligent about drawing a proper distinction so as to avoid problems. 
Also, there are just soooo many forks. No one wants to mess up a transaction.  I believe this is why just about everyone calls it bcash.
@_date: 2018-05-28 15:18:19

However, talking to them about a potential future where the select few no longer have total control of every aspect of our lives through their closed shop ability to create fiat out of thin air, is more than worth while.
Please make sure they understand bitcoin is NOT an investment measured in fiat terms, but rather an investment in this potential positive future. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 18:26:00
True. I really should have clarified that.
Thanks for pointing it out.
The seller has to want the BTC as BTC, not fiat. 
It Seems very reasonable to me that as Bitcoin matures, they would WANT to keep their liquidity in BTC as they are likely selling their house to buy another, which is also more desirable in BTC, all for obvious reasons.
Right now, people see 'buying' bitcoin with fiat as the only way to get a hold of some.
Wait until the penny drops that you can sell your mcmansion for BTC and THAT is the way to get your mits on some instead of the bankster fiat on ramps.
That'll drive the price up. People exchanging fiat to BTC to buy houses and that BTC NEVER going back to an exchAnge for fiat, but onto the next house seller and onto the next etc.
Ultimately, most house sales become fiat showing in a bank ledger temporarily as holding place for value until it is exchanged for another house. This process is so much more convenient with BTC.
@_date: 2018-05-19 23:59:03
Yes. They are trying to map out WHO exactly owns the bitcoin. THEY will come after you, no doubt about it. History does repeat itself and it's the same goons it's always been.
We know how THEY operate.
Unfortunately Local Bitcoins is now corrupted and compromised.
Boycott local bitcoins.
They claim that they NEED your personal gov ID, which they share with EVERYONE including all the data on your trades and purchases. 
Call them out on it. Open a support ticket asking why they NEED this, they never NEEDED it before and as far as I can tell, the best way to protect yourself from identity theft is to NOT give your gov ID data to some random web site who  you don't even know and will share the data with EVERYONE.

Typical answer of someone not willing to broaden their perspective. It's not a belief, it is a phenomena that is happening. My 'beliefs' and my religion have absolutely nothing to do with it.
When I tell my mates in OZ, who call McDonald's 'Mackas' that in the states people call it 'Mickey Dees', they don't argue with me about the official name used in the media or who's right or wrong. 
They don't waste breath on,  is 'mackas' better than 'mickey dees', or inform me that McDonald's implemented a way of cooking called 'mickey dees' and therefore colloquially calling the business  'mickey dees' is simply wrong and my beliefs are my beliefs, just like a religion etc. and that they are simply right because A stock exchange calls it 'McDonalds' etc

Without overgeneralizing, You may be right about that and here's my 2 Sats worth:
By and large they are innocent. ALL current old people were the same when they were young. 
It might only be because when you are young, it's all about YOU, right NOW. There literally is no time to see the fraud, because you are too busy building a life and having fun to look up and see what is really going on.
Once life has slammed you a few times, you start to wonder. Then slowly, as you get older, you are left behind, left out. Your own expendability to the very system, becomes obvious and brutally real, no more fluffy illusions that you ever mattered at all. It hits you hard, you become jaded.
Then you generally put YOURSELF out to pasture and give up. 
OR, 
increasingly - you get angry, then wake up and reinvent yourself, become of service and try with all of your supposed 'wisdom' to help the young people to get off that damn conveyor belt, think for themselves and 'just say no' to the man while you still can.
It is futile, but you try. The kids come back at you with all the same preprogrammed lines you yourself used to use - that they don't yet understand were intentionally put into you so that from generation to generation, THEY only have to focus on the young - filling them with erroneous beliefs. To hold them back, to make them accept the world as it is, NOT as it  can be imagined it to be.
You try to explain Edward Bernays (see BBC documentary century of the self), who created this mechanism in the first place, but they call you an old fool, which you also used to do, and don't even look at it. The things put in front of them are simply more compelling.
That being said, I am greatly encouraged by a certain kind if young person here now in 2018, that I didn't see in previous generations. I find a lot of these amazing individuals are EXTREMELY skeptical of what they are told, they refuse to sellout, they ARE building a better world, they get that they are the drivers of their own lives and they are inspired to 'do the right thing'. They are open minded and open to learning, but never quick to just believe what they are told, instead willing to consider many perspectives.
Many I've  bumped into are the kind of kid who is attracted to the crypto space . In fact, it is why I hAng around it.
This idea of just opting out, ignoring the legacy world and just building another version is blowing MY old mind and I take my hat off to each and every one of them.
They are still a minority in their generation, but as I said, this particular mindset  is new. As far as I know, this earth has NEVER seen it until now.
So now, I am the student. I am the disciple trying to get that way of thinking into my own old and over pre-programmed head.
Because of this small but growing group, It truly is the best time to be alive.

Bitcoin shot through Iran, for example, back in 2012. Most people bought it, not to get rich, but for the dream of living without fear of having your children bombed by Umercan weaponry.
Today, there's probably more crypto rich 'average people' in Iran than in the home of the fee, land of the slave.
AND THEY AIN'T SELLING

That is not true. It's slower and more expensive than a normal segwit transaction. 
Although this was true last year, many months have passed, which are light years in the crypto space.
Beware to bcash ignorance, they are stuck on propaganda lines and don't stay Breast of technological developments.

I've been spending and replacing for years now.
There is no issue. It just amplifies your spending power while achieving gains.
If you are in a technology or crypto backwater like Umerca, yes, the exchange fees might be an issue. Taxes might be an issue there even it is immoral to give ANY money to the US gov, but hey, you have to, right?
Ignore the taxes. Spend and replace.

You are right. 'Investing' fiat in bitcoin with the hope of getting fiat returns is sad.
However, 'investing' in bitcoin to be a part of securing a future without endless fake wars paid for with fake fiat created out of thin air is probably the BEST investment you can make in this era of human development.

Mate, for starters, It doesn't annoy me that you call bitcoin bcore any more than if you call mcdonalds makka's. That childishness shit is for bcash shills. We know what bitcoin is, call it kabooblate or segwit coin for all I care. It simply doesn't matter what you call it, what matters is what it is. 
Even with the bcore consensus which you claim is 'centralized software', the bitcoin community would never be able to pull off the kind of decentralize decision making that you have already had a number of times on the bcash alt coin chain , eg the EDA fiasco. Bcore is simply way to decentralized to make that even a remote possibility.
The centralization you need to worry about is not the CONSENSUS that happens when the best ideas and best software rise to the top in a true open source project that has thousands of developers and reviewers.
Rather, it is the centralization that occurs that makes the network insecure and open to bad actor or nation/state attack vectors because the mining is controlled by one entity. 
Even if Jihan and co are benevolent, there is a significant attack vector open for a bad actor to zero in and take control BECAUSE of that centralization. Their benevolence is completely irrelevant. It is why bcash cannot be taken seriously. You folks NEED to solve this particular problem.
It is not a scam in the limited way you are imagining a scam to be. That would be obvious, easily detectable and therefore ineffectual.
The scam is where the bankster forces use their age old tactic of divide and conquer to take control. It is THEM after all who funded all of this silliness. THEY know that bitcoin is censorship resistant, but they believe they can get control by altering and controlling the narrative to take control of a fork which they CAN control. The idea was:
1 - fork bitcoin
2 - claim it to be THE bitcoin
3 - run massive lamestream media and social media campaigns to misinform, disinform, divide the community to sway opinion that this controllable chain IS bitcoin
 and hopefully
4 - centralize bitcoin
5 - permission it with 'acceptable' and 'in-acceptable' addresses 
6 - get back to business as usual with the whole world's population locked down with a trackable one-world currency even more than before bitcoin reared it's ugly head.
They failed. Thank God.
But those of you who fell for it based on your greed (their primary weapon against us through the ages), thinking there would be some kind of flippening, not realizing that true HODLers from before this fake 'blocksize debate' saw right through it - even expecting this kind of attack, are still stuck in 2017.
You thought you'd missed the boat on bitcoin and would get in on the 'ground floor' with bcash. FOMO had you in it's grip. You believed their narrative.
You are still believing that with your tiny americo-centric reddit bcash crowd and your one sole developer and your benevolent leaders, that somehow the whole world (outside of Umerca,where the real HODLers are) will at some point sell their solid, secure, censorship resistant, proven store of value and LEADERLESS bitcoin for corporate structured, centralized consensus and centralized mining bcash alt coin.
This idea is so ludicrous that it would be funny if it weren't so tragic. You are falling for the same old game this crowd has been unleashing on ignorant peasants for generations.
I know you are 'invested', but you aught to Cut your losses while you can and get on the right side of history.
The truth may hurt, but it also sets you free. Feel the pain, but do it anyway mate. It's the development of stoicism to be part of the bitcoin end game that counts, nothing else.

Because bitcoin 'price' is determined by the tiny percentage of 'liquid' bitcoin in active trade on exchanges.
Today, according to marketcap.com $6.1B dollars worth of bitcoin changed hands. We all know the vast majority of these are flipped back and forth on exchanges (mostly by trading bots), but assuming each trade was for a bitcoin that was not traded further in the 24 hour period, only 753,000 bitcoin are in the 'liquidity pool' (as if bitcoin in themselves are NOT liquid, duh). 
That is only 5.3% of the 14M bitcoin already mined.
The vast majority are HODLed, as in, will NEVER be traded back to fiat at any price. This HODL wall scares the shit out of the legacy financial system incumbents. They are desperate to change their fiat wealth into bitcoin. THEY have an unlimited amount of fake fiat to 'buy' bitcoin in exchange for that fake fiat created by THEM out of thin air.
The intention is to use this artificial 'price discovery' in bankster owned 'exchanges' in conjunction with lame stream media narrative manipulation to try to get us REAL HODLers to part with our Bitcoin.
It won't work.
My recommendation to you is to forget about 'the price', zoom out, learn what HODLing actually is compared to holding, learn what the bitcoin  revolution is actually about, and make sure you pass the message on.
Bitcoin is about removing the power from the central banksters to fraudulently create money out of thin air to pay for endless fake wars.
This is far more important than getting rich in fiat value from 'trading bitcoin' to buy a lambo.

Don't even try. There are too many variable at work.
Just keep buying bitcoin with money you can afford to lose - even $20 a week is enough. NEVER sell back to fiat.
In time, IF bitcoin becomes the standard for deciding what ALL currencies are valued, then use it to buy goods and services. The buying value of your bitcoin will be orders of magnitude greater than what you put in.
Trading is for fools.

That being said, what's your skill set. Maybe we can do some transaction. Just that it would have to be an equal value exchange. I've got heaps of friends who need help in all kinds of things, I'd be happy to pay you to do something significant for any of them.

I'd say nice try, but the whole 'bitcoin is a religion, they are all nuts, they are greedy hoarders' narrative has been tried on so many times it's boring and failed miserably every time. It has no legs.

They will then have their bitcoin financial data attached to their ID, which will be sold on and some actors will use that data to further map true ownership of bitcoin, along with the already available data on exchanges.

Again, you haven't thought this through. Corporatism is right there next to communism/fascism.
No one said anything about anarchy, although that is not such a bad idea either. 'No corporations' is not the same as anarchy.
Most of human history no one dealt with corporations. We don't NEED corporations. It is a failed model and only causes social problems and environmental degradation.
There is NOthing cool or ok about any corporation or corporatism. No thing at all.
You just think gooooogle is somehow 'cool' because they let their slaves play pingpong or hang out in beanbags. You have your corporate products you have learned to identify with because of their relentless advertising and social engineering. That isn't YOU. You weren't born to work for a corp or shop for a corp or identify your very self through corporate products and messages. These are things that happened to you by design. These corporations have been doing this for generations, it is their matrix.
You don't HAVE to stay in it. Life is actually much better when you are corporation free in your dealings with teal flesh and blood human beings.
Unfortunately, it is the model that the entire planet has to live under. Corporatism has absolutely nothing to do with the Bernaysian idea of left-right politics. It is something that controls our lives regardless of which side of the Bernays left-right thing any jurisdiction has chosen to pretend it lives under.

Having a dumbed down fool who is like the poster child celebrating the success of the decades long dumbing down agenda, is NOT a good thing for bitcoin.
In Umerca he might BE somebody, which is ok for the average Umercan fool, but the rest of the planet feels embarrassed for you that you have even allowed such moronic consciousness to fill your brain space.
Do NOT let this uniquely Umercan tragedy to color the exciting, consciousness expanding bitcoin space.   
@_date: 2018-05-11 02:38:54
That's not what it's about. That's just how THEY want you to think - that it's about selling stuff to people. Expand for a second, step outside of the matrix they have laid out for you. Exercise original thought.
What it IS about:  
It's that THEY know what everyone is doing while we don't know what they are doing. This gives them total control, similar to when the western world was locked down into generations of 'dark ages' because everyone was doing 'confession' at the roman catholic church. They had total control at that time - for generations. We are still paying for it through Umercan style sexual repression and other erroneous thinking patterns.
Are you prepared for a few generations of complete lockdown and control? If so, be my guest, continue along on the sell-out road.
They do this deceptively,in the modern world they do it by controlling the narrative. Look around. People form their 'opinions' based on what they are constantly being exposed to via their own personal 'filter bubble' (look it up). They actually believe that their thoughts and opinions are their own, but they are not. 
It is already rare to hear original thought. They are already successful in controlling the narrative through the pick-me-look-at-me consciousness through THEIR 'like' button.
Be vigilant. Read history, learn to understand their motivations.
Avoid goooooogle, fb, twitter etc at all costs.

'Sounds like the sentiment often seen .... Bla bla bla' - now you are just making things up.

Some of us aren't into this for getting rich in fiat terms, you pathetic sold out fool. I know it is hard to see the world from outside of your narrow lamestream media fed paradigm, but that doesn't mean that some of us haven't achieved it.
Your arguments are strawmannirg because your neurons can't understand what I'm getting at.
The reason gold stopped being used as a currency is because some very wealthy elite ( I won't mention names) realized they could enslave even the monarchs at the time by paper representation of that gold in promissory notes. 
The ignorant fools of the day couldn't fathom the scale of the deception and these powerful wealthy already had an intense amount of control. They learned to believed lies like manufactured boom and bust cycles are normal. And that this new phenomena of the bag holder was a natural result of 'markets'. 
1 plus 1 is 2 because it is math. However, just about EVERYTHING else is NOT math and therefore an advanced perspective of the thing does indeed alter the understanding.

It would mean that EVERYONE alive would be richer as we have transferred some of the wealth from the 0.001% who control over 99% of the world's resources.
If this meant that we were able to get say 2% into the hands of the rest of us through bitcoin, there would 2000 times as much 'wealth' in the hands of the rest of us.
It would also start becoming extremely difficult for banksters to pay for more fake fiat funded wars to oppress and murder people world wide. It would mean the end of Umercan imperialism.

If you Umercans really feel it's necessary to be complicit in oppression, theft and wholesale murder, by funding the insanity, well, there's not much we can do for you.
But it doesn't change the fact that paying any money at all to the US gov is immoral and sinful. You'll pay for it.

My friend, I am already an old man. By the time you crypto warriors and bitcoiners win and bitcoin IS the final settlement layer for ALL value exchange, I'll be long gone.
This really has nothing to do with me, but rather mankind's eternal struggle against the forces seeking to enslave him.
It's about all of our kids, grand kids , great grand kids etc.
As for ME, the increasingly senile old guy, I'm well ahead on any 'investment' I ever made in Bitcoin and anything over $560 is fine by me as it has already multiplied my meager 'retirement income' - that is if you could even call something so meager a retirement income.
Again, I got lucky. One of my grand daughters gifted me some bitcoin a number of years ago. 
But believe me THAT is completely irrelevant in comparison to the idea that because of bitcoin , just maybe, NONE of my descendants will have to live through as many wars as I have had to. ALL if them being fake bankster wars driving humanity further and further into ignorance, stupidity and outright slavery.
This idea keeps me alive. This community overall has more balls than anything I have seen in my lifetime.
There are if course those who are struggling with it internally because the mere existence of an option to exit the fraudulent fiat debt based system forces you to come to terms with what is real and what we've been led to believe.
We are all on this journey together. Thank you so much for humouring this old fella and engaging in proper discussion.

They are right. Bitcoin is NOT an 'investment'.
It is however the only leaderless money in the history of mankind. It is global and it is inevitable that one day ALL value will be determined in Bitcoin, including the wealth of these turkeys.
They are just butthurt that they will NEVER be able to transfer their full wealth into bitcoin because there is simply not enough available for them to do so. The HODL army is mighty and non of us will ever sell back to fiat at any price.
It's crazy that the current fiat value of berkshire equates to more than 3 times the market cap of bitcoin or 73 million bitcoin, which will never exist, yet these guys can't stop slamming it.
Scared?  I think so.
There's a tiny percentage of the supply of bitcoin available for exchange on all of the exchanges combined, these privileged criminals will have to compete with each other tooth and nail to acquire some of them.
The rest is in the hands of normal people.

Look, just because the dollar is so unstable and undependable, losing value at an alarming rate, doesn't mean the same need be true of bitcoin, which just reflects the dollars weaknesses.
Bitcoin is consistent. It just marches forward. It is the money badger. It don't care how many dollars are printed or restricted. It creates at 12.5 BTC every ten minutes regardless of which fool happens to be in power or how much debt the FED wants to create. Regardless of which 'exchange' buyers and sellers of dollars decide the 'price' is , It is NOT reactionary and politically fickle, depending on wars and an unbelievably dumbed down user base like the US dollar depends on.
If you want to measure the stable consistent reality of bitcoin standing in the shifting sands of the dollar, of course it will appear the bitcoin is moving, but it ain't - we can all see it's consistency, it is transparent. We also know the bizarreness of dollar creation and instability of all fiat money throughout history. What, you believe the dollar will be the first and only fiat currency to escape it's inevitable fate. That is just foolish.
Your visionary capabilities are severely lacking. Don't worry, it's common to just repeat over and over the things you hear people repeating. You've been programmed to think in this way, you are by and large innocent for your lack of cognitive ability.
Deflation may not be good for spending in an economy as we now have it. That much is obvious.
Let's try to imagine a new kind of economy where people are rewarded for value for money,  for acting in humanity's best interests, for actual 'economy' (in the real meaning of the word), maybe even manufacturing things that actually work - wouldn't that be novel? 
Just because our current system incentivizes waste, greed, corruption, planned obsolescence and consumerism, does NOT mean that THAT is the right way forward or the only way forward. 
Quite the contrary - our collective inability to see past the vision of the world pushed onto us by the lame stream media is leading us to complete environmental destruction and annihilation.
It might be an idea for you to expand your mind and consider the possibility that you are the victim of erroneous thinking and belief systems.
Have a go, what have you got to lose. Humour me, try using your brain to think an original thought. You were born with this capability, it just lies waiting to be utilized. It won't hurt that much.

My Hod you are delusional. Do you even understand how non mining nodes operate?
Big blocks means less non mining nodes. That is good for the owners of bcash. They are banksters and miners. They want total control, they don't want a farmer in india supporting the network by running a full non mining node. They want control of all nodes through their rich bankster friends.

Yet a currency that loses it's value every year forever IS a valid currency.  Hmmmmm.....
Let's run an experiment in creative thought, bear with me. 
Let's value the dollar from Satoshi:
July 2017 - 50,000 Satoshi per dollar
Nov 2017 - 15,000 Satoshi per dollar
Dec 2017 - 5,000 Satoshi per dollar
Feb 2018 - 15,000 Satoshi per dollar
Mar 2018 - 10,000 Satoshi per dollar
May 2018 - 12,000 Satoshi per dollar
Now THAT is volatility my friend.
It really is just a matter of perspective. And perspectives change over time. This is about choice, individual choice.
Will you CHOOSE to view it from the perspective of sound money that will inevitably Be the final value settlement proposition,  purely BECAUSE it is leaderless and NOT controlled by any one country or cabal, OR will you CHOOSE to view it from opaque, debt based, unsound money created in secret decisions by a small but powerful group of ruthless war mongering scum hell bent on destruction and complete control and humanity's slavery?
It is just a choice. YOU have to CHOOSE, for yourself.
Coke or Pepsi, It's just a choice. Bitcoin or fiat. It's just a choice.
Please, for your sake and the sake of ALL future unborn generations, make the intelligent choice.

There is no way they can transfer a significant part of their wealth into bitcoin fast enough.
One, it would cause extreme runups in price
Two, the 250,000 thousand bitcoin NOT being HODLed are simply not enough for it to be possible.
Three, they own banks - outright. These banks create money out of thin air from which they set loans to their other holdings, again, out of thin air. They simply cannot do that with bitcoin.
Believe me these criminals are terrified of this silent people's revolution.

I think we are on the same page. I agree with you completely.
I wasn't talking about barter or what other people decide to do. In fact I'm not even recommending people do what I do. 
I was just telling a story on what i like to do and it has very little to do with being smart with my money. I often pay insane amounts for a product if you calculate the current fiat value, just because I like the guy or gal (even better) and am enjoying the interaction. I like to see the surprise when they recalculate based on some chart on the www. I'm ahead enough in what the BTC 'cost' me. Most of it was given to me by my grand daughter in 2014. She's a nerd !!!
I'm in my 9th decade. I like to play with this. I'll be long gone by the time you all win the good fight (all true bitcoiners and HODLers are fighting) and bitcoin becomes the final settlement layer for ALL value. So I'm just doing my little bit, in my senile way ;)
Thanks for touching base and keeping it real. You are an important part of this awakening, I can see it in how you express yourself. You seem to exercise original thought, not just repeating a lame stream narrative or even worse sone crypto echo chamber mantra.

It's not a pump when they are reviewing the phenomena of bitcoin - there are millions of people involved worldwide. 
This would be called news. There are millions who are interested in any take on this revolutionary technology. The world's ONLY leaderless currency, the only one in world history.
Talking about underutilized alt coins, whose user-ship is limited to the shills on r/btc, less than total bitcoin users in 2011, it is NOT news.
It's a pump.
No one outside of  r/btc gives a shit or has even heard of bcash.  It is NOT leaderless. Just another corporation trying it on a small group of ignorant people - again.
That is so common, it isn't even a meme, why on earth would THAT be news ?!?!?

It is so easy to pick on bitcoin, but what about we do as a mass when we allow our deified corporations hold back the real innovations that could have solved ALL of our energy problems and environmental problems decades ago.
Not to pick on Warren again just because he's a complicit moron, but:  
Has anyone done the numbers on how much energy is wasted and carbon released from just Warren Buffet's corporations?
The real carbon footprint of this one person's activities. This one environmental criminal's destructive legacy?
No, they haven't. Because somehow, just because he is some sort of 'great investor' that we worship, no one cares about the poisoning, the oppression, the environmental devastation this ONE man has unleashed on the rest of us over his 'career'. It is literally littered wit corpses, and not just human ones.

I feel ya. In fact, I come from the same way of thinking and have never used coinbase for that reason. Let the consumer decide.
This however, is very much different.
They are intentionally deceiving the members into handing over their personal info, attached to their trade history AND the addresses that will match such ID.
This is straight up fraud being perpetrated at the place that by far has the most bitcoin trading volume.
This will affect EVERYONE in the bitcoin ecosystem.
Even if you just 'opt out' and get on with your life, combined with the data from big exchanges, by mapping ALL addresses, it can destroy bitcoin fungibility and ultimately adoption and price. A great idea will have been relegated to the dust bin of other great ideas that have been destroyed by THEM again!!!

I think you need to revise what revolutionary means. What you are describing is a movement. The iPhone was revolutionary, but in effect it kicked off a movement. All the copycats are part of the revolution itself, but what we are experiencing is a movement.
When the 'movement' continues, with 'competition' or not, it revolves in a cycle and continues. That is revolutionary.
Just because a bunch of copy cats arrive, does NOT make Bitcoin a movement as compared to revolutionary. All of these alts (not leaderless) are just part of that revolution.
The crypto currency movement.
Bitcoin is revolutionary in a large part because it is leaderless, open source, censorship resistant etc. That can not be said about the alt coins in the crypto movement.
So far the cryptocurrency movement has a lot of players, but the revolutionary aspect sits with Bitcoin and Bitcoin alone. Bitcoin IS and always will be, revolutionary.

Poster is not running a 'narrative' he's teaching you about what is actually happening with large amounts of fiat being invested in bitcoin infrastructure.
Sorry to burst your bubble, but It is a far better indicator on adoption than a random gaming corporation being whimps and caving to the man.
Careful this sub is full of sellouts - paid bankster shills trying on ideas like 'there's no adoption', 
It never works. 
Might be a good idea to look into what bitcoin is actually about - is it possible that it's not about buying a bunch of corporate shit or getting rich in fiat terms, but rather about mankind's eternal struggle against the forces that seek to enslave him?

They could just say 'hey, we had a good run. But Now because of this ruling, this law and this regulation we are having to ask you for your gov ID'
That would be honest.
I find this very troubling.
I am also very confused as to how exactly uploading my personal gov ID info, which can be used to steal my identity, protect me from Identity theft.

I think this bankster created lamestream media attempt to use our greed against us to derail the real reason for bitcoin's existence by creating the narrative that it is some kind of 'digital asset' class that gets bought and sold in fiat for fiat, can be dangerous. If too many people fall for it, not only does the information not travel - that bitcoin is us real people taking over, Nothing more, nothing less - but these people will simply be used as instruments for the banksters to turn THEIR fake fiat money into REAL hard currency - bitcoin. They'll lose their money.

You haven't thought this through.
They tried that when segwitX2 was building up with heaps of nodes coming from cloud services.
It still takes thousands of people running nodes in concert to enforce the rules. In bitcoin, very unlikely at this point. 
For bcash, well, they have centralized mining and nodes, so maybe go talk to them. It is something they actually could do, which is a bit scary.
In bitcoin, this would already be impossible.

That's a myth. 
Bitcoin - It's an open source project. If you understand that, then you'll understand that by merit, some very committed, talented devs emerge from the thousands contributing, through respect for their work to become 'core devs'. It's an open shop. Even you could be part of 'core' if you had what it takes. It's a meritocracy.
Bcash on the other hand has a single developer who can change what he likes whenever he wants, for example the EDA. 
That fiasco is possible through bcash's centralized nature,  in mining, development and consensus.
It could NEVER happen in bitcoin.
If you don't understand this, then it is because you have not educated yourself. Now you have learned that there is something you don't know. If you are open minded and intelligent, you'll do some research into what open source means, what decentralized means, what censorship resistant means, what leaderless means.
If you are unwilling to learn, then you deserve the bcash shitcoin and to be at the mercy of the bcash overlords.

The point is, there's only so much bitcoin. As much as anyone tries to fraction it out or make derivatives etc. it isn't bitcoin unless you control the keys.
I could write bitcoin IOUs all day long. That does not 'create' more bitcoin.
However, as a bank i can write IOUs all day long, in fact they do, and it DOES create more dollars in an actual sense because of fractional reserve.
No-one, outside of bankers or people on an exchange are ever going to accept a fractional bitcoin or a bitcoin derivative as an actual bitcoin. They will know the difference because the bitcoin are in your wallet.
It's akin to: You can argue with me and pretend to yourself you are superior all you like, you may even fool some people, but that doesn't make it true.

Maybe seeing the power of international instant transfer, I can get him onboarded to bitcoin.

Not sure which buzzwords you are referring to, but I would very much appreciate your help in understanding them, whatever they are. I may be prone, like the rest of us to be influenced by buzzwords, so any clarification you could point me to would be much appreciated.
I can apologize for my part of the exchange with the poster and hopefully you can excuse me for attempting to understand a perspective on a topic I bumped into for the first time ever on this thread. And of course, I ask for your understanding in my thanking the commenter for the time and effort it took to write such a long description OF THEIR PERSPECTIVE.
As far as I understand, the ideas that were thoughtfully elucidated have very little to do with the OLD left/right paradigm of the last century, but rather are exploring new ideas based on THE FACT that almost all production and many services are now created by technology, robotics and computation - as in 'unpaid'. 
I found it interesting.  Being in my ninth decade it is of course not so easy to fit the concept into my brain, but my curiousity is stirred non-the-less. Not that I 'agree' yet, it will take some time for me to mull it over.  My generation was very much influenced by the ideas, birthed from the narrow left/right Bernaysian social programming, that you cling to so ferociously. I think we ALL need to let go of that.
I'm just keeping my mind active by exploring the new ideas that we really aught to be looking at in this new century. Quite harmless, really.
If it somehow triggered your tendency towards arrogance, then that is something that YOU will have to take responsibility for. I would recommend you taking a moment to explore these things that trigger that response within you, it will hold you in good stead as you move through this amazing thing we call life, win you friends and bring you greater prosperity, happiness and health.
Looking forward to hearing from you.

There's no hate for BTC.
You've just been to the wrong sub, which CAN give you that impression, but it's coming from a handful of people who couldn't do math and made the wrong decisions. There's only about 24 of them, but they are very vocal and active.
Also, it's kind of an Umercan thing. The rest of the planet is becoming increasingly aware of the world's ONLY bossless currency and really falling in love with it.
If you know any other languages besides english, let me know and I'll point you out of this Americo-centric dumbed down hell-hole called reddit and you can see the exuberance and enthusiasm that the potential to become free of the Umercan tyrannical empire is fostering.

I understand. I get what you are saying and on reflection I realize you are spot on and it is a case of semantics. Although the laws are pretty much global, it seems developing nations by and large ignore them and they are not enforced.
However, like you pointed out, as soon as you need banking services those regulations have to be adhered to.
I guess my frustration is that from the outside it seems like the US and it's citizens take this new (for the human race) paradigm of 'knowing your customer' far too seriously and in effect turning all participants in the economic system into spies for the IRS.

I've been paying bitcoin for most of my monthly expenses for years now. The last 4 months, I've made over 500 transactions on LN, which before LN would have been on-chain.
Not a single issue and actually easier to use than onchain in many respects.
And still, have not found even one place which will take the bcash airdrop tokens I still have from the fork. And I live VERY far from the strand beach in NQueensland.

Just because you can't fathom a world view which is not hierarchical top down in nature, doesn't mean the rest of us can't.
Segwit X2 was a corporate takeover attempt of the open source collaborative development of bitcoin. Fools like you, who pander to business models and corporate interests simply can't fit the new decentralized paradigm into your brain. 
The USAF, was WE the USERS of BTC refusing to become the subjects of those corporations, that old boring corporate world view.
Those of you still needing SOMEONE IN CHARGE, never understood consensus and you still don't, so you have your bcash corp coin, where SOMEONE IN CHARGE calls all the shots for you. Nice and comfortable.
Problem is, the top down model can't compete with open source collaboration and so the whole world got to witness the spectacular public failure of that corp coin attempt in the big block bcash experiment.
Your bosses having an infight ego fest and forcing all you corporate led sheep to choose your boss was just icing on the cake. True entertainment.
@_date: 2019-03-03 03:11:04
It'll be hilarious when users demand LN payments instead.
@_date: 2019-03-16 02:57:41
You'll have some misinformed people who don't understand the importance of consensus tell you things like bitcoin cash (more easily referred to as bcash to avoid confusion) is better because bla bla bla.
At the end of the day, Bitcoin is supposed to be a decentralized, bossless, open source, consensus driven and permissionless currency.
Bitcoin is those things. When the big corporations got together to try to force a takeover of development away from the open source model with the NY and HK 'agreements', we the users fought back by running the USAF -User Activated Soft Fork. Consensus was maintained in this way. Those same corporations then forked into bcash try then try to take over the brand bitcoin, resulting in another ordinary alt coin - bcash.
None of these corporate attacks work in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is still going, stronger than ever, WITH CONSENSUS.
Bcash is a bosscoin, like all other alts. There are no multiple 'implementations'  of bitcoin. There is only one - BTC - that runs on consensus. Bcash, bdiamond, bgold, bsv etc are run by a single entity, no consensus, corporate run coins. Nothing new here - permissioned money.
There is no need to waste your time taking risks on bcash, it is doomed. Down 96% and failing on every metric.
Making a bcash transaction is exactly the same as making a BTC transaction - zero difference in usability. Making a LN transaction is thrilling in many ways. Try both. Avoid bcash.

Nice try, but that narrative is soooo flawed on so many levels. 
Try again at rbtc, they live inaccurate narratives over there, extremely entertaining. I'm pretty sure the remaining online users (and dropping daily) are just  enjoying the cognitive dissonances expressed there.

Probably better warning you.
I have a friend. He managed to buy at avery single high besides dec 17. He doesn't care, he doesn't look at the price much. He's 1000s of percent ahead.
Got another mate, real sharp. He bought dips and sold on peaks very successfully and then on shorting at about $3000, he couldn't get back in, saw the bubble and started buying on the way down. Even he's ahead.
Just forget about how many satoshis a dollar costs, but keep selling the ones you don't need.
@_date: 2019-03-03 04:27:44
People who only care about price are holders.
HODLers will NEVER buy fiat with bitcoin at ANY price.
@_date: 2019-03-03 04:04:46
Yeah, gotta stay out of that rbtc sub, it really will give you that impression. 
But at the end of the day Bitcoin is exactly what it always was - the world's first and only bossless medium of exchange. It's just scaling quickly now with offline, instant, cheap and completely private transactions on the first second layer use of this bossless medium of exchange with lightning transactions.
Again, as amusing and entertaining the cognitive dissonance on the rbtc sub is, it really has nothing to do with btc (despite the sub's name) and is a terrible place to find accurate info.
@_date: 2019-03-02 03:02:17
Saying something as asininely stupid as 'which bitcoin' is more than a little alarming. You've drunk the coolaid.
The whole reason people outside of Umerca (like the Thai) are enamoured with bitcoin is for one reason only:
It's the world's first and ONLY bossless medium of exchange.
ALL the forks that try to ride the bitcoin 'brand' are bosscoins.  Globally, people are wary of switching the old boss (banksters) for the new boss (altcoin website 'team').
Only Umercans are falling for the whole myspace/facebook false analogy.
@_date: 2019-03-01 01:11:27
Umercans are different. They are insanely ignorant and comfortable - the most important thing is their 'opinion' - as if opinions are created equal. People find bitcoin because they need it. It's why Umerca is waaaay late. 
@_date: 2019-03-03 04:13:54
Being a corporation, I'm pretty sure jack doesn't have that kind of power. He's legally charged with carrying out the board's decisions and the board is probably made up of 'investor' who NEVER want to rock the boat with the powers that be.
@_date: 2019-03-29 05:44:08
You must be a hair splitter. I am not advocating anything.
What I am doing is trying to get the thick Umercan brain to understand that the rest of the planet bought bitcoin a very long time ago for reasons that did not have 'investment in a digital asset class' amongst them.
I am simply explaining. Not advocating, not judging right or wrong to invest, spend or HODL.
Just pointing out the facts.
What one person views as inflammatory non sense, another person might view as self evident common sense.
It depends a lot on whether you carry the standard issue Umercan world view around inside you 24/7 or not.
@_date: 2019-03-28 04:05:23
Yeah, roger Ver  paid them to act like that, so he could make a post on r/btc that there is somehow adoption of bcash happening in Japan. 
The facts are actually that the Japanese are very wary of bcash, and understand that it is another corporate scam.
They'll be back to normal in a few months. They Will drop bcash after the appointed period of time and just accept only bitcoin again with LN operability in their POS software.
@_date: 2019-03-30 11:19:09
It's funny you mention that. I got introduced to bitcoin because my landlord demanded payment in BTC.
I thought it was just some payment processor like paypal.
That was years ago. It looked scary and when i was bitching about it, my grand daughter jumped to the rescue and hooked me up. She never thought i'd be interested in Bitcoin because it was before SPV wallets and not something your grandma could use ;)
That being said almost all of my monthly bills have been paid in bitcoin since then and now BTC through LN.

There's no such thing as bitcoin core. 
That term exists only on bitcoin.con, (which is best avoided) and on the r/btc sub reddit, which is to be frequented only if you are into schadenfreude and enjoy watching desperate people who have lost 97% of their investment value because they believed a corporate narrative, repeating silly, tired and false narratives back and forth TO EACH OTHER all day long. It's amusing, but sad.
It is well known that in that sub, you will find every single post's 'discussion' dominated by the same user names, repeating falsehoods 24/7. A list of the top 30 was published by u/truthvigilante recently, which got her banned. 
The top 50 seem to be able to post 24 hours a day, without sleep, so they are of course suspected paid posters. 
It is the private sub of Roger Ver, who is the man behind bitcoin.con and the confusion behind this elusive 'bitcoin core', to try to trick people into believing the bcash corp coin has anything going for it at all, that it somehow IS bitcoin. 
Quite laughable, but people such as yourself are victim to the fraud every single day, which is not so laughable.
@_date: 2019-03-25 07:53:35
I got banned ages ago, I'm pretty harmless too, just questioned their narratives with facts and asking for sources to the endless drivel.
Recently, I saw that a user named truthvigilante got banned for listing the top 30 user names that dominate every "discussion" on every thread.
It was very accurate. Every single post is hijacked by these same 'users', who appear to post 24 hours a day. They seem to deliberately fill all the comments with the same phrases over and over. Weird.
As hilarious as that is, it is also quite sad that they are so committed to keeping the false narratives alive between them.
Do they think real users actually go there for any other reason than entertainment? 
I notice today, it is all about a 'controversy' about the twiitter  handle.  That it is a non existent "controversy" outside of those user names in that unfrequented corner of the internet, looks so desperate. 
Very bizarre place.

You should post this on rbtc.
When bcash forked, I noticed that people who fell for the scam were reacting to social media campaigns and those that dumped the airdrop for BTC, got their news from researching and doing math.
My experience is anecdotal, but it would be an interesting thing to research.

Seems like none of the Bitcoin forks prosper though, they may 'survive' in some misinformation wasteland of bagholders who can't see reality, but they decline by all metrics over time.
In this way forks can be sad. 
Dogecoin is a fork, but isn't Sad because it was kind of a joke and chose to be different. Even has it's own name.
ALL the Bitcoin forks using Bitcoin in their name are sad. People bought into them with the hope of being 'super-early adopters' of the next bitcoin, without having to risk or adopt anything un-tested (like the really early BTC users did).
The 'investor mentality' of these bagholders is sad, but I guess they got what they deserved. Bitcoin is NOT an investment. It is peer 2 peer cash. Intrinsically both an SOV AND MOE.
So yes, they 'survive', but they don't prosper. I think it is because they are missing the only big point that has the whole world enamoured with Bitcoin: 
Bitcoin is simply the ONLY bossless medium of exchange in human history.
You can copy the code, even have the high profile corporations on your side (making 'agreements' on your behalf), maybe even better technology. 
But without true bosslessness like Bitcoin, all of those projects are a waste of time and decline into obscurity.
@_date: 2019-03-03 02:11:37
Neither of you are making any sense. Poster didn't say anything beyond offering to cover the small amount that their bill would be in the world's first and ONLY bossless medium of exchange.

A roadmap, is an obsolete concept in the open source realm.
The 'roadmap' idea is a fragment left over from corporate software development, which is lingering on in corporate administered crypto projects, where directives are passed from the top corporate management down to the developer department.
In open source development, the 'road' appears as a result of thousands of people working on a project that is live. 
As much as bitcoin users with a consumer mindset want the security of someone 'up there' being in charge and fulfilling 'roadmap' promises, it simply is not how bitcoin, or any true open source projects move forward.
You'll see in the comments, where people have offered you links where things actively being worked on, tested and implemented are being communicated about, but a 'roadmap'? You'll have to explore the corporate crypto coins if that is what you require.

No need to convince you otherwise. If this were the case - that a marketing paradigm for a corporate product is in any way similar to a non-corporate completely bossless currency - It would have happened ages ago.

There is no competition for that.

Yes, Bitcoin core is the name of one of many bitcoin clients. 
It is not the name of the currency, which is commonly known to the global public as Bitcoin.
Bcash is what bitcoin cash is commonly referred to worldwide. In fact in many places people don't even know it stands for bitcoin cash, the spectacularly failing bitcoin fork.

Not really that fast, cheap only because it's trading value is 96% down and falling and on chain is much more secure on BTC. 
BTC is easier to use and has 100% fungibility when using lightning. Bcash, every thing you spend is recordable or traceable and all the SPV wallets verify their transactions through 3 supernodes, which could be compromised and censor your transactions. This is not possible on the Bitcoin chain.

I think you are over estimating the Japanese's view of Roger Ver.
Number one. Virtually no one in Japan has heard of BCH. 
Secondly, I would say pretty much no one has heard of or would care for Roger Ver. 
The few that do know of him, just view him as another America Brat.
Japan is an ancient culture. They may tolerate fools like Ver, but they have been screwed over many times over the centuries by his ilk, and are wary of trusting fools.
Japan is all about bitcoin for one reason alone.
It is bossless, leaderless.
It is the world's ONLY  bossless medium of exchange in history.
They would NEVER switch the old boss (banksters) for the new boss (latest flashy looking team on a crypto coin web site). They'll dabble and they'll gamble, for sure. They love that.
But adopt some scammy corporate directed non coin like bcash.

It seems there's less than 200 of them, including the not regular posters, which might make up the few who actually believe it.

There are no alternative implementations of BTC. All the copy paste bitcoin wannabes are ALL bosscoins and corp coins.

It seems there is a group in chiang mai (thailand) - lightning network chiang mai that sets businesses up with Lightning node for very reasonable price.

Not sure which buzzwords you are referring to, but I would very much appreciate your help in understanding them, whatever they are. I may be prone, like the rest of us to be influenced by buzzwords, so any clarification you could point me to would be much appreciated.
I can apologize for my part of the exchange with the poster and hopefully you can excuse me for attempting to understand a perspective on a topic I bumped into for the first time ever on this thread. And of course, I ask for your understanding in my thanking the commenter for the time and effort it took to write such a long description OF THEIR PERSPECTIVE.
As far as I understand, the ideas that were thoughtfully elucidated have very little to do with the OLD left/right paradigm of the last century, but rather are exploring new ideas based on THE FACT that almost all production and many services are now created by technology, robotics and computation - as in 'unpaid'. 
I found it interesting.  Being in my ninth decade it is of course not so easy to fit the concept into my brain, but my curiousity is stirred non-the-less. Not that I 'agree' yet, it will take some time for me to mull it over.  My generation was very much influenced by the ideas, birthed from the narrow left/right Bernaysian social programming, that you cling to so ferociously. I think we ALL need to let go of that.
I'm just keeping my mind active by exploring the new ideas that we really aught to be looking at in this new century. Quite harmless, really.
If it somehow triggered your tendency towards arrogance, then that is something that YOU will have to take responsibility for. I would recommend you taking a moment to explore these things that trigger that response within you, it will hold you in good stead as you move through this amazing thing we call life, win you friends and bring you greater prosperity, happiness and health.
Looking forward to hearing from you.

I find people join as noobs, eventually find their way through the quagmire and sort out their own personal situation after which they don't need to check back in.
It's like using a new app, you might be reading about how to use it and be part of a community for support on it, but after that you just use it.
Most people just HODL or take advantage of the utility and don't bother to take part in 'discussions' on whether it works, will go up or down, will fail, will take over etc.

Do not be afraid.
Bitcoin is global.
As much as Umercans are quick to trust the next corp or the marketing, the rest if the planet is VERY wary of suits and is enamoured with bitcoin because it is a possible way out from under the thumbs of western corps and banks and fake fiat.

Whether I am right or wrong or what I want to believe is sooo irrelevant. It has very much more to do with what society has decided a word means that counts. I could refer to cars as peanut shredders all day long, but anyone I am communicating with will simply not understand MY definition because it is not a societally agreed upon word for that object. In effect, my use of the language would be ineffectual.
Merriam webster def of musician:
 a composer, conductor, or performer of music
Longman's def of musician:
someone who plays a musical instrument, especially very well or as a job
Whatever people want to 'argue' about a definition is irrelevant. 
Language - words - are societally agreed constructs to mean a specific thing. You can't just alter it do that it fits your wants.
A turntable is NOT an instrument as in there is nowhere on the device where you can play a note or series of notes or even trigger a percussive sound. It requires actual prerecorded music which already exists in order to make any sound. 
Although, it may be possible to use a turn table AS AN INSTRUMENT (by maybe tapping the needle with my fingertip to create a rhythm, or 'scratching'), much like i could use a sledge hammer smashing an oak cupboard in some kind of rhythm as an instrument, it does not inherently make a sledge hammer DEFINED as an instrument. And besides that, in order to use the sledge hammer as an instrument in such a way, I would actually have to BE A MUSICIAN - as in someone who has the required development of skills to create sounds which are 'musical' - as in rhythmically in time. Without that skill, NO ONE would call the sound of an oak cupboard musical, it would just be noise.
People can argue all they like, but the turntable device itself is simply not defined as an instrument.
DJ are defined as 'disc jockey' - someone who plays or recontextualizes prerecorded existing music that was played by musicians. 
As much as I would like people to think of me as a race car driver because I can drive my Prius very fast with very good control, the fact of the matter is, that the definition would live in my mind alone, making it external to society's agreed upon language. 
This is what DJs are trying to do when they talk of themselves as musicians - society at large does not agree. The DJ cannot create any 'music' using a device beyond the prerecorded or sampled sounds that are being executed. On an actual instrument, you can go anywher, you are not bound by any pre-existing input.
If a DJ or a DJ fan really wants to believe they are musicians, it really is no skin off my nose, I could care less. 
But that doesn't make them a musician. 
It makes them a delusional fool that obviously didn't have the discipline  to learn how to play music well enough to be awarded society's label of musician.
But hey, up to you......
Just push play

Venmo and paypal etc are just platforms, they can use any currency. Bitcoin is a currency.
It is possible (but unlikely) that any of these platforms simply switch to calculating value in Bitcoin.
ALL other cryptocurrencies are tolerated simply because bitcoin exists - and there aint nothin anyone can do about it. Without bitcoin, NONE of those projects (read: companies) would be tolerated and would be shut down by banks through their control of governments.
Bitcoin is NOT a company OR a platform. 
It IS a protocol. It IS a currency.
The volatility of the fiat system will stabilize in time. Right now a dollar will cost you 15,000 satoshi, it has gone as low as 6,000 satoshi. That is way too volatile. In time, all the fiat and crypto-projects will find their satoshi price and stabilize.
@_date: 2019-03-09 09:06:41
@_date: 2019-03-14 03:55:02
No. There is only one bossless currency in human history. It's called bitcoin, the common ticker is BTC.
Although there are many bosscoins using the bitcoin name to try to ride the coattails of the bossless one by deceiving new crypto enthusiasts, they are all sad and desperate attempts by the gullible holders of those bosscoins, who were fooled by the bosses of those 'projects'.
You'll see the odd misinformed fool, who can't do simple math repeating stuff they've been told by their leaders, or trying to 'convert' Bitcoin users into their BETTER-THAN-BITCOIN scam as if Bitcoin is some kind of religion or belief system. It is all very sad. 
This VDO is a classic attempt to try to make one of BITCOIN's many scaling solutions seem clunky. It is, as usual with this kind of trashpost, full of disinformation that the mentally challenged boy in the VDO repeats as truth. Don't blame him. His intelligence is obviously wanting somewhat, his bcash investment is down close to 100% and he's been lied to repeatedly. He's not to blame.
For example, the premise of the video is that the highly efficient, instant confirmation, decentralized and completely private lightning payment network being built on top of bitcoin is some kind of bank maintaining an 'SQL database on both ends' by managing bank IOU receipts.
It's sad, but what a laugh. Who is this bank? Where is this SQL database being 'updated on both ends'? Where are the bank IOUs?
He actually repeats this fodder that's been fed to him as if it is accurate. It is glaringly laughable in a space full of people who actually understand technology enough to see this poor brainwashed, informationally deficient young boy struggling to justify his bad investment decisions.
He could also have just done a simple on-chain BTC transaction, using an SPV mobile wallet (which requires third party trust, but is convenient), he could also have used a non-custodial LN wallet. 
There are many things wrong with this lame clip. All it did was make fanboys of failed bitcoin copycat projects like BDiamond and Bcash look like desperate fools.

It can be hard for many of us to break out of the programmed mindset that UBI is a socialist/communist idea, where as you explained that it is almost necessary to save capitalism from itself.

There's a big difference between permissioned non-cash tx and non-permissioned non-cash transactions.
Remember there is a massive push to remove cash so that ALL transactions require the permission of a third party.
Bitcoin is here to save us from that hell.
This article's data is only interested in and based on non-cash transactions which require a third party to permission you.
When it comes to fiat Physical cash is good.
Hopefully, we'll see a period where bitcoin becomes so well understood that there will be a difference in value between physical paper fiat and digital fiat valued in terms of Satoshi per dollar.
Right now both physical fiat dollars and digital fiat dollars are in parity, their value being roughly 15,000 satoshi.
@_date: 2018-10-07 14:48:29
For some of us it is. 
I have a friend who simply could not wrap his head around buying BTC (also an old timer like me), he decided to demand payment for his services (engineering consultant) and rent on his properties in BTC and let the payer work out how and where to get BTC.
Both of us spend BTC for 90% of our needs and wants.
It used to require some persuasion, but most people are happy to accept BTC now if you show them how.

It cracks me up that the whole world calls in bcash outside of the hijacked sub, yet they still get offended by it. 
It's like mcdonald's getting their panties in a twist because in Australia they call it macca's.
The 'discussion' you seem so willing to grind on over and over again has been over sinve people put numbers into a calculator on their own and came to their own conclusion. 
Those that chose the corporate agenda with bcash did so because they didn't do this simple exercise. Now they are holding bags that are becoming worthless. 
The weird dysfunctional corporate narratives and slogans are not worth discussing, because they have long been debunked and then ignored.
You can go back to the 40 user echo chamber at that over censored sub, where ANY intelligent posters get banned if you like and get your fill of 'discussion' on issues that haven't been relevant  for a very long time.
Heaps of inaccurate posts about BTC and LN to confuse the shit out of you as well.
In Bitcoin, decisions are made by consensus, not by discussion and debate and then initiated from top down. That's bcash, not bitcoin.
The exodus from bcash is pretty much in full swing, so it gets more desperate there every day.

I am in my ninth decade, not yet 90. I find it strange that you resort to slander, abuse and accusations while at the same time coming up with very lucid points that I tend to agree with BECAUSE I lived through the pseudo-communist eras. I would appreciate a bit more civility.
Your point about UBI  creating an incentive without a product or service in return is a great point and helps me to formalize a better understanding of UBI as how it would play out disastrously. Thank you for that.
Also, i very much agree with your point on the lack of incentive that would result in an even less educated population with brain-drain and lack of skills become something of a norm. After generations upon generations of people globally, acquiring knowledge, understanding of the natural world, expansion of consciousness and creative endeavor (almost to the point that we might say the things that make us human) - That situation would be even more disastrous.
That being said it still leaves me with the question: if all current occupations are disappearing at an astonishing rate, rendering many people's skill set redundant, who will be able to pay for goods and services?
Any ideas in this regard?

I'm pretty sure Bitcoin doesn't have to 'compete' with third party solutions, in time the third party solution itself will continue about it's business, but all payments will be denominated in Bitcoin.
Saying that Bitcoin has to compete with paypal is like saying the Euro has to compete with automatic teller machines. 
The dollar has to compete with the Euro and the Yuan and the Yen, bitcoin does not. Bitcoin is here to usher in an age of unprecedented creativity and productive output as a result of replacing the dollar as the world's reserve currency.

Filtering drinking water is always big, knowledge of edible weeds, another. Massage, health knowledge. Books made of paper. Fuel for sterilizing utensils.

I hear ya, but don't let it get you down. Remember Bitcoin is global. And although in America people seem more than happy to deify corporations, corporate plunder and corporate 'leaders', the rest of the world is not so quick to trust suits. We might find a pretty serious backlash against any corp coin, only making bitcoin stronger and better understood.

Accepting paypal payment for bitcoin is risky for the seller of bitcoin as the person paying the paypal could reverse the transaction upon receiving the bitcoin leaving the bitcoin seller unpaid and paypal WILL NOT help in disputes involving bitcoin.
I'd recommend bisq
You can maybe put your paypal funds into something more legitimate than paypal - something that a bitcoin seller would accept on bisq.

I was in Iran in 2013 when Bitcoin fever swept Iran.
They bought for the right reasons:
The possibility that this might end constant Umercan evil empire aggression and oppression on the ancient tight culture that IS Persia, that there is a glimmer of possibility that their grandchildren and great grandchildren may grow up without the threat of Umercan bombs raining down on them.
They were not and still are not 'investors'.

It all started with the term gen X, which was to be followed by gen Y and then Z. The idea is that deep inside of us - subconsciously - we are supposed to accept that there is a 'last' generation. Part of the eugenics agenda.
The narrative failed because we all resisted and called the following generation millennial, but now they have total control of the narrative and have roped everyone into mass conformity through the like button and are unleashing the generation Z narrative.
If nothing else, we should call this generation generation Ynot, as in why not clean energy, why not peace, why not a fairer financial system, why not electric vehicle, why not universal income etc.
That would double thwart them in their attempts at annihilation.

Completely with you on that as someone who gets the technology.

It really makes me giggle now. I was the same with credit cards. 'I use cash, that plastic is for fools, it'll never become mainstream.' Was my thinking - and I was a young man then.

I'm pretty sure I'm not infringing on anyone's civil liberties to 'chose' anything.

Bitcoin has grabbed our attention worldwide, not because of some 'ease of use' frictionlessness' of the digital realm or ANY other reason, but because it is bossless.

I was on the smoking balcony at hong kong airport. 
3 Pakistani business men ask me for a light. I give it to them. 2 of them are tanked and the third is on his way. They are giving each other shit about the bill at the airport VIP lounge bar and one of them says "your card never works, so it's no excuse." I say, "just another reason to use bitcoin."
One of them says "you have bitcoin?"
The next one says "i have bitcoin!" And pulls out his phone to show us.
He's got blockchain wallet and 0.83xxxx bitcoin on it.
Tells me hasn't opened this app in ages, meanwhile the other 2 are all over us for more info on how to get it AND right now!!
I said download a wallet and get it from him pointing at the wallet owner who it turns out is the guy in the group that always has a card that doesn't work.
They said he wouldn't have enough on there to pay them what he probably owes them. LOL
Then I realize the 2 who don't own BTC know that it is worth a heap, but the guy who had 0.83 on his phone was unaware of the price range it is in now. I showed him the price on my phone, should have seen his face. 
Beautiful. Priceless.

There is only ONE bossless currency. In fact BTC is the only bossless medium of exchange in history. The founders are unknown, the development is pur open source consensus with the majority of participants being anonymous. These mechanisms themselves make it unique, which is why the whole world is enamoured with it.
ALL of the alt coins have founders, bosses, centralized points of attack. Without the bossless one out there in the wild NONE of these projects would last 24 hours. They simply would not be tolersted.

There are no 'bitcoin accounts'. Accounts are what banks use to account for the 'funds' on their ledger. In bitcoin you have a wallet which you can add or spend bitcoins. Similar to a physical wallet.
You currently have an online wallet at localbitcoins, that is more akin to an account at a bank. But you could just as easily download a trusted wallet onto your smart phone and store your BTC there.
The BTC you have on an online wallet are actually not yours as in the money in your bank account actually is in control of the bank. 
Read everything and all the links in the sticky at top of this sub. You will have a very good understanding after that.
Known trusted smart phone wallets include blockchain, bread, mycelium, jaxx. Take your pick, make sure you do the backup and HODL.
Once your BTC is valued significantly higher in fiat, start to spend and replace. Ask everyone you purchase from them if they take BTC. Spend, then rebuy what you spent as soon as you can at or below the price you 'spent' at.
1 - 'invest'
2 - study bitcoin
3 - HODL
4 - spend and replace
5 - goto 1

I feel ya. But at the end of the day, it is a currency, it is money and so if those with lots of it - wealth - are choosing to try to fit it into their way of doing things, it kind of makes sense. It is as if the dollar was imploding, so the wealth of the world starts scrambling to open Euro or Yuan accounts.
At the end of the day, the 'institutional' thing is still a metric for adoption.
I just pray that we the people are HODLing the vast majority of it.
Let the institutions scramble and compete with each other and the rest of us to accumulate only the new coins being mined.
Let us start finally paying each other in it.
I have started talking to people about the revolutionary idea of accepting bitcoin as payment instead of buying it at exchanges.
@_date: 2017-08-14 01:29:47
I have a mate who bought almost all the ATH starting with 'the big one' in '13. Always HODL and forgot about it. Today, he's Happy as Larry. He's way way ahead on his fiat 'investment'.
I'm trying to contact him. I'll let you know when he buys again, it'll be the new ATH that day. He's very consistent with buying on them. I know he bought at a recent ATH before FUD downturn and upward correction.
Buy when you have the money. Don't worry about the price. We are taking part in washing the blood stained debt created fiat into  a clean currency. One that your conscience can live with very peacefully.

Because the Petro is entering the space and has to prove itself, it's value will be denominated in Bitcoin. 
That alone begins an era where National currencies become denominated in Bitcoin.
It's all moving so much faster than we think.
In effect, if I lived in Venezuela and had small online business, say t-shirts online or traditional woven baskets, I would need Petro to pay my staff, rent, suppliers etc.  Therefore, I would need to buy those petro with Bitcoin which maybe I received for sales. It may have short term utility, but it seems people are adopting Bitcoin quickly as well.

Correct. Your coins are 'stored' on the bitcoin blockchain. The 12 seed allows you to have access to your keys via a wallet, which gives you sole control over the spending of your coin.

Good point. Presently, the US is irrelevant as far as bitcoin ownership goes with the vast majority being held by people around the world. Hopefully this ratio stays as it is as the pressure to implement KYC is uniquely american.
The large institutions are so far behind it is unlikely they will ever end up with any really significant amount of bitcoin or influence in the space. This is good. They are part of the failed fiat system and they deserve to be replaced.
It is the people's money. Not the corporation's or bankers money.

No, it's not a fad,  these companies are realizing that it is easier to accumulate BTC by accepting payment than it is to buy it on exchanges.
Bitcoin IS being adopted for this reason. The volatility of fiat currencies will lessen over time as the US dollar gets replaced by satoshi and goes under parity. For the past few months the us dollar has been relatively stable at roughly 15,000 satoshi.
As the dollar supply increases, the dollar value will drop below it's ATL of around 5,000 satoshi moving towards parity with satoshi and below.

From your phone you can store wealth, make payments to anywhere, Accept deposits from anywhere, trade, lend, borrow and invest. Your phone literally becomes a bank - in the crypto realm. In some countries, you can do pretty seamless banking with fiat via a banking app on your phone. If you can sort out an account via your phone to a fiat to crypto trading platform, you can literally do all of it from your phone. 
It will get exciting when we can do away with the fiat part, which is such a drag!!!!

The point is most people on the planet spend and earn something other than dollars in their daily lives and in THEIR currency, bits and millibits are confusing. Satoshi on the other hand are very manageable numbers FOR THEM.

We'll finally be pricing in BTC and fiat is some thing that drops in value in comparison to the consistency, the anchor, of the math. Today i would have to part with 29,000 satoshi to get a dollar.

Because traditionally, when the market loses confidence in the stock market, feeling that it is overbought, capital will flow into gold. In a way BTC which is 'digital gold', or at least it's touted as that (It's a currency)., may see fiat flowing into it as a result.
Let's see. One of many current predictions.

@_date: 2017-08-09 04:15:06
A large part of the apparent price increase is really a reflection of the runaway printing of fiat that is occurring.  We have simply never had a way to measure that. Now we do and it looks like BTC is going up, but in reality it is fiat money supply being expanded into oblivion.
With all of the added fiat pouring into crypto, more and more from informed people. Of course it is shooting up.
It is simply a better option and people are gravitating towards it. It will continue to shoot up.

At $6,000
874 Satoshi for a Mexican Peso.
501 Satoshi for a Thai Baht
328 Satoshi for a Philippine Peso
161 Satoshi per Nepalese Rupee 
149 Satoshi for Japanese Yen.
 12 Satoshi for a Myanmar Kyat
1.23 Satoshi for an Indonesian Rupiah

All alts exist because bitcoin exists. Bitcoin is the only true decentralized, consensus governed, un-owned crypto. It is hard to believe that as the crypto ecosystem grows, and the awareness of that distinction between bitcoin and all other alts increases, people will still choose a centrally governed alt coin as the central currency.
But maybe??? Heck, a lot of people were duped into believing corporate produced hip hop was some how counterculture 'music'.

I have paid for air tickets, hotels, restaurants and bars, but usually when traveling have to find a way to exchange. I'm retired, so I have the time and I like to meet others who buy and sell BTC.
Daily purchases are normally cash or debit card. 
I am always quick to transfer the money I would have spent to exchange to replace BTC at or below the price I purchased at. Ising bitcoin just makes my retirement more affordable over time. Just stay on top of your BTC balance and keep it slowly creeping up :)

I have a theory on that. For me at the moment, when I have the chance to transact in crypto directly, I spend about 10 minutes talking to the vendor (or supplier) about bitcoin and making a new friend. I expect that as confirmation times shorten, so will conversations about bitcoin, until it is so mundane and commonplace that no one is talking about bitcoin, just using it to transact. At this point transaction times are virtually instantaneous. Just need the math for it now.

Put 10% of your paycheck into BTC paper wallet address that you'll 'never' touch as soon as you get your pay. This will make you very wealthy in time.
Put another 25% into BTC immediately as well, but on a mobile wallet on your phone. Assuming price you bought is same or higher, ask every merchant you deal with if you can pay BTC. If price has gone down, spend the fiat.
This will ease your monthly financial burden.

Developing good relationships. Developing high moral character (and I'm not talking about sex). Developing skills and talents that better the lives of your neighbors. Watching your kids grow up. These are some of the important things.
But I'm still wondering why a guy deciding to busk for some bitcoin leads to a discussion coming from a purely bernaisian perspective. There is no left, there is no right. These are ideas that have been installed in you by Edward Bernaise. 
Are we so deeply running on program and which side we picked that we can't have an original discussion with original ideas. Must we always just launch the left/right paradigm program and just start standing our ground? Very quickly descending into outright hostility to our fellow posters?

Maybe as a way of countering the evil they witnessed at gooooogle.
NEVER use goooogle products. If using a decent one like sketchup, download through tor and use only offline. If utube, the only decent goooogle product - use tor, hit new identity button often.
NEVER use search. It is terrible and results useless unless you want to buy stuff. Use duckduckgo.com for superior search results and no ip address metadata bullshit.

Goooogle can only lose from crypto. They are 'winners' at the fiat game. It is their very foundation. They are an arm of the NSA, the last thing they want is to be complicit it destroying that.

Since crypto, the creative business mind inside of me has woken up and the capitalist sleeping inside me has reared it's gorgeous head.

Try to train your brain to see BTC as a currency. The price in fiat is an illusion. Turn as much fiat as you can afford to into crypto regularly - as you earn it.
You are then converting illusory money into real money not backed by debt. You've already done yourself and future generations a service at this point.
Spend your BTC when the fiat amount (representing your time and efforts) is higher than what you 'invested'. Replace the spent amount by converting fiat as soon as you can below the price you spent at - even if it is only a few dollars price difference.
Keep doing this and you'll see your crypto assets grow.
In this community we all need to train our brains to think from bitcoin, not from fiat.
For example 1 BTC = $3400 is thinking from fiat
$1 = 34,000 satoshi is thinking from BTC.
Don't ask what the price of bitcoin is, rather ask, what is the current price of a dollar?
@_date: 2018-10-07 13:01:09
It doesn't matter. What matters is your choice. 
Many of us demand payment in BTC (and let the payer work out how to get some) and pay our landlord, farmer, personal trainer, corner shop and maid in BTC.
Jump on, do the same.
This is how Bitcoin changes from the money of the present (for a fringe group of us) to the money of the future (for everyone).

The ripploff is not a good option. It is the bankster 'crypto' scam. Centralized. The anti-thesis. 
That being said. Take say 25% of your BTC and try to increase it trading alts. Do your study on the coins. The vast majority have no future.
A lot of people have already been burned by the ripploff. If you can guess when the banksters will pump and dump it, go right ahead and ride their fake wave, but better to 'invest' in coins that have some kind of 'merit' - as in the real sense of the word spiritually speaking.

I remember when ATM cards with PIN numbers came in. People found it so difficult and adoption was sloooow.
So as simple a card and a PIN seems in 2017, it was a real challenge people had to hurdle at the time with many problems along the way with grandma forgetting her PIN.
It makes no sense to try to make it 'easy' for where people are at now with cards and PIN, when the wallet infrastructure developing is already far superior to that system. You already have your phone - use it. It actually is not necessary to dig into your pocket for a card to swipe to enter a pin on a reader anymore.
I have a bitcoin debit card with a PIN, but find it clunky compared to just QR code capture, input of amount, fee and send. My wallet allows me to track my transactions by putting in a note. This is a massive benefit compared to just a card and a PIN.

It depends where you think your market will be. If your market is world wide, you better do satoshi.
At $6,000 per bitcoin you pay:
874 Satoshi for a Mexican Peso.
501 Satoshi for a Thai Baht
328 Satoshi for a Philippine Peso
161 Satoshi per Nepalese Rupee 
149 Satoshi for Japanese Yen.
 12 Satoshi for a Myanmar Kyat
1.23 Satoshi for an Indonesian Rupiah
0.73 Satoshi for a Vietnamese Dong.
These are significant populations who are increasingly technology obsessed and well aware of inflation and banking stealing your savings from you, which are not that far off parity to Satoshi.
Bits and Millibits and such still end up being useless to a population far far bigger than the US or Europe.

@_date: 2017-08-18 05:36:41
IF it is decentralized it is extremely difficult to manipulate it. If it is centralized, it is so because it is designed to be manipulated.
The point I'm trying to make it that bitcoin's very existence makes all other coins possible. If bitcoin was not unowned, it would have been taken down. If bitcoin ceases to exist, the alts will be regulated and hounded out of existence.
My point had very little to do with choices made by sellouts, who would probably invest in coca cola and monsanto, even they know the evil those companies do. There will always be people who are led around by the nose by whatever powers that be and so you are right, people with a me me me mindset definitely don't care. They just want to make 'money'. Even they have zero understanding of it. Even 'preferring fiat' while the very system enslaves them.
What is happening though, my friend, is that there is a planetary consciousness evolving. People are starting to be aware that what happens to the planet and their brothers and sisters is of supreme importance. Even more than making money. Shock horror!!!

And aren't fiat a type of enforced ponzi? You have to pay your debts and taxes with this currency. Those first in line in the money creation game through fractional reserve banking are dependent on new loans to create more money. When it gets to the point where loans can no longer be repaid, the system collapses and people are left holding the bag in form of fiat that has no value. Without constant influx of new loans, entrenched system cannot continue. It is a ponzi.

Probably right. Every thing is so slick, even the P2B2P (peer to bank to peer) banking apps have QR code to scan for transferring to someone's account. Kinda looks like crypto, but doesn't feel like it. 
I guess it's the pseudo crypto-experience.
And yes, he's probably got his bank's 'P2P' app on his phone, but the legendary, notorious sought after bitcoin is different. It feels different transacting directly - the crypyo-experience.
The point is, he'd heard about it before, maybe read something, whatever. Enough to be interested in it, but not enough to go out of his way to seek it or learn about it. When presented with an opportunity, he was very enthusiastic.

Good to watch them floundering, but the fact remains - they haven't got a clue. Are late and will never be able to compete with the crypto traders, who will just take their money.
This is good.
 Established winners in the regulated system which favors them are not accustomed to unregulated wild volatility traded world wide by anyone 24/7.

If it was all about buying and selling, like stocks, then sure. Bit what is happening is that fiat money is being exchanged for a new currency worldwide simultaneously, so all of those currencies are simply being changed to bitcoin. The apparent 'price ' of bitcoin will go up as a result. All currencies are ponzi like in nature. 
What happens to the last people left holding fiat. No one will take it from them. They will be left holding the bag on a multi generation Ponzi scam.

And remember to spend and replace. Make purchases with BTC when you are 'up' and replace it as soon as you can when it is a bit lower than when you 'spent' it. This will increase your spending power and increase your BTC over time - assuming of course it keeps going up over the long term.

My Friend, it's not like they ain't trying.
It just isn't working.
That being said, one of THEIR narratives has been swallowed hook, line and sinker by EVERYONE, bitcoiners and nocoiners alike:
That bitcoin is a type of digital asset that is valued in fiat terms and subsequently gets bought and sold for fiat to hopefully increase one's fiat wealth. 
The last thing they want ANYONE to think is that. God forbid, Bitcoin is the silent revolution, whereby WE - real people - take part in a small way (each and every one of us) to quietly remove the power of a select few to create money out if thin air to lord it over the rest of us and throw fake fiat funded wars.

I completely 100% agree with you. My gripe is more about how we got here, how we let that happen. I believe you are correct in that now that we are here, we NEED government. I don't think it is an absolute truth that society needs gov, but where we are now makes it very difficult to get back to something less oppressive because we have become accustomed to the system AND because we have forgotten how to take care of each other. We have forgotten the simple community support systems we have had since the dawn of time. Everything has become the responsibility of an institution or gov. Can't just yank that. Those that suffer most would suffer even more.
It's a tough one for sure.

Set them up with a wallet on the spot. Send them their first income from purchases. At that point they are in and can accept BTC. Business owners are usually stunned that it is that easy to accept bitcoin.
Explain that the only tricky part is crypto to fiat conversion. I've found that most of them don't expect a whole lot of BTC purchases in the short term and are happy just to hold some bitcoin - WOW, that was easy.
@_date: 2018-06-04 14:09:09
Interesting method. But seeing you are already in BTC.
Start viewing it from how many Satoshi you have to part with when you buy a dollar or spend a dollar in fiat.
Similar To when you are in, say Mexico, spending Peso, you constantly do the mental conversion to see what it actually cost you in dollars.
Not only is it fun, but it is more accurate as you are already in BTC.

The contentious hard fork was intended to replace the open source 'core' dev project with a centralized controllable version of bitcoin to become THE Bitcoin.
That attempt failed. It ended up as just another fork of bitcoin into alt coin oblivion. Marketcap means no thing while cripple, which isn't even a cryptocurrency, is at number three and the vast majority of 'the top 100' are ETH tokens.

All other alts are centrally created and administered. Bitcoin is actually the only full consensus cryptocurrency which is unowned and in the wild doing it's thing. Bitcoin's mere existence allows for the space to able to create alts.
I' pretty sure that as crypto grows as an aspect of societal function, so will the understanding of it and people will be aware that bitcoin is THE important one. 
'Cryptos' like ripploff will proliferate and we'll see fully centralized crypto being used and holding value, but the one true crypto will always be BTC.

Borrow say 10,000 on visa card. Buy BTC. When it is higher than buy price, take out double monthly payment of visa in fiat and keep for making payment. Continue until paid off. Surely over 2 years, you'll still have some BTC left over.
There will be the odd month where BTC has not been up enough to carry out this strategy. So it is best advised to carry out this strategy ONLY if you have enough disposable income to be able to pay the double minimum payment of your visa bill from your fiat income - possibly for months on end.
I'm pretty sure long term this could work out for anyone who could maintain payments during down turns.

Maybe it's their new narrative. "Stick with cold hard cash, 'digital money' is not as safe. Gov can track you."
By putting all of the legacy digital systems and crypto into the same basket known as 'digital money' and pitting that against 'real cash', when in fact the truth is that it is all of fiat (digital or otherwise) is now pitted against all of crypto.
Trying to counter the growing IDEA of crypto - our money.
I do however agree that, all news is good news and all exposure is good exposure. People in general won't even watch the add, but they'll pick up the intended message (that it is part of 'digital money' like the other fiat digital options) AND the unintended message, which in this case will be more powerful. That message being that bitcoin is a safe valid payment option, it's not scary.
Maybe now They'll look, they'll learn, they'll join, then they'll transform, they'll create and they'll prosper.

So you are so superior and your world view is simply better because you equate "compensation/benefits, location, co-workers, employer, clients" with the validity of your occupation.
There are people in this world who will walk around the base of a mountain prostrating themselves in worship  every 2 meters for years on end. Is their choice of spending their time (the only thing we really have) doing this less valid than your choice to stay on the rat race in return for your self-valued "compensation/benefits, location, co-workers, employer, clients"?
Your world view is a very common one, proscribed by the agenda, nothing original about it. It shows that you are simply repeating what you have been programmed to believe and have put very thought into why you view things this way.
Developing Tolerance and compassion to accept other world views than the one fed to us, is a challenge for all of us, but it is the road to peace and stronger community.

So, like Nicaragua 'investing' in the US dollar as part of their 'foreign reserves' negates the US dollar from being a currency? Better tell everyone who's using it quick because I'm pretty sure they are still using it as a currency.
 I really hope you've thought this through and aren't just repeating something blindly.

No, not 'correcting' your 'opinion', which is so important to you umerican'ts. I'm simply attempting to get you to see that there is nothing so important about anyone's choice of pastime or livelihood that makes that choice more or less valid than anyone else's. It isn't really that hard to comprehend, unless the very prospect of it threatens your tidy little unthought out worldview. Your mind don't like that , so it makes you angry and then you can retort to insults because you have been programmed to use this device to temporarily feel better as being the insulter somehow makes you more superior.
Hang in there, you'll get there eventually.

I HODL, but to me it is more important to spend.
I keep track of what my BTC actually cost me personally and I make sure I am getting a good deal according to that. Then I make sure I buy back BTC as soon as possible at or below the price of BTC at purchase point.
I find that by doing this, I always seem to have BTC in my spending wallet, yet am covering my bills. Not sure how far ahead I am monthly, but I remember when I was always slightly short every month. I've been doing this for most of 2017 and have very little need for a bank account, but still have one. I am 'ahead' every month now.
It just feels better to transact in OUR money - especially when you are able to earn BTC in return for your time, product or service. HODLing some of that and using some to purchase things I need. THAT is a great feeling.
@_date: 2018-06-02 18:31:03

@_date: 2018-06-05 13:55:38
Take the time my friend. This is the long game. 
No one ever said NOT to spend bitcoin, but rather spend it with people or businesses who will further spend it instead of just treating it like some complicated visa payment system to transfer fiat value and basing their business in fiat terms, constantly converting back to fiat.
Of course you are going to answer back something like how can a business run if it doesn't convert back to fiat or some other not thought out repeater drivel.
The answer is, those businesses are not part of the long game and should be avoided. They are sellouts and their entire model is based on the fraudulent current fiat system which is systematically destroying everything in it's path.
You'll need to expand your thinking, use your imagination and exercise some vision to get what I'm trying to convey. 
@_date: 2018-06-01 18:12:21
Don't worry. 
It's not Umerca, people out here have no interest in any of the forks and are completely unaware of bitcoin cash and if they do, they refer to it as bcash to avoid confusion. There is no where to acquire it and so on. The bitcoin in this part of the world has been in the population's hands for years already.

Mate, it's not like they haven't been trying:
Hong Kong 'agreement'
NY 'agreement'
Segwit 2X
And the endless bizarre narratives:
- It's for tewowists &amp; peterFiles
- It's for drug dealers (as if they are the bad guys)
- It's THE cause of global weirding
- It's a great idea, but flawed and our version will be better
- KYC/AML is normal for us all to live under (having to be their deputies in spying on each other, after thousands of years of not Knowing Your Customer's source of funds)
- It's a ponzi scheme
- The greater fool 'theory'
And the most intrusive (and effective) narrative of them all:
Bitcoin is a digital 'asset' to be valued in fiat terms and to be bought and sold in fiat for potential fiat profit. It MUST be viewed from the point of view that fiat IS the deciding value layer, eg 'what is 'the price' of bitcoin'.
God forbid we realize it is Humanity's  first real tool/weapon to remove their assumed power to create money out of thin air to fund their endless wars, surveillance, oppression and theft. Simply by realizing that a dollar is worth 12,000 Satoshi (at the moment).
It won't stop. The attacks will become more sophisticated.
The current one being to monitor fiat onramps to track addresses and link them to our KYC gov ID, hopefully in time creating 'black addresses' or non KYC compliant coins, which will not be processable through corporate entities without penalty.
We are still ahead. LN network will be a large part of making this ploy ineffective. The smart people are still on the right side of history - the developers taking part in developing bitcoin and second layer solutions. These people are well aware of the long game and the dangers of us selling each other out AGAIN, or even worse, vehemently fighting for our oppressors by being dumbed down idiots supporting the oppression by repeating THEIR narratives as if we are intelligently 'debating' each other.
We have to stay vigilant and spread the message that this is a silent revolution, a nonviolent revolution, whereby through ganging up against the school yard bully on mass, we all only have to acquire 0.01 BTC and then
1 - start paying each other for goods and services in it, trying to maintain our 0.01 BTC spending wallet. 
2 - Saving ALL of our monetary/liquid wealth in it, NOT in a bank. And ultimately, 
3 - at some point each of us bites the bullet, individually in our own time, and refuses to budge unless we collect payment for our time in BTC.
Keep up the good work,

Bla bla bla....
We are taking about 'illegal bitcoin', there is no such thing.
If some oppressive regime like the Umercan gov decides something is 'illegal', that's their problem, but it don't make it so. Other people in other places might balue different ideas and therefore have different laws, that don't make it so either.
Better you examine where your thoughts come from, realize they are actually not your own and that they have been implanted into you. Get off of the media, especially the narrative controlled social media and then release your mind. 
You might even learn something or quite possibly, with practice, in time even have an original thought that actually is YOUR thought.

It is not a lot to risk to put 0.01 BTC on your wallet and start trying to use it and get paid in it without ever selling it back to fiat and talking to EVERYONE to quietly do the same. In this way, we quietly and non-violently make the oppressors impotent.

Nowhere near 7%. I mean seriously, have you ever met a bcash user in real life? Even met someone who knows someone who knows someone who uses it?
I'd say about 0.007% of the community - those with something to gain and those gullible enough to think social media campaigns and r/btc shilling are indicators and have ANY effect at all.
The only significance of bcash ovrr the many other forks is the mining hash power and the media visibility of the bcash leaders, who haven't exactly 'left bitcoin', they've got their feet in both camps when it comes to actual coins they control.
It's all an illusion, all part of the rich man's trick.

The only breakdown of 'the bitcoin system' was the fake 'scaling debate', the Hong Kong 'agreement', the NY 'agreement', segwitX2 and bcash.
It was all corporate pushed and backed by banksters intent in using the age ild divide and conquer strategy.
The were successful, but failed with conquer.
Bitpay's business model is anti-bitcoin for 2 main reasons (setting aside the obvious, being support of the abovementioned corporate/bankster takeover attempts).
1 - to change bitcoin into fiat as quickly as posdible.
2 - being a trusted third party in a system which is supposed to be P2P cash. This puts businesses on the wrong side of understanding bitcoin and the dominion they COULD have over their bitcoin, simply by using a standard wallet.
Both strategies are corporate designed attempts to slow true bitcoin adoption down.
Not to worry though, LN is decentralized and is quickly being developed by the smartest devs in the space to derail corporate sellouts like Bitpay.
Think about it, don't just jump to the support of the corporate oppressors, as we have been programmed to worship corporations and corporate success stories. 
It is all part of THEIR plan for a system of worldwide corporatism, where it will be impossible to exist unless your purchases are with a corporation and your income comes from a JOB with a corporation, or if you are very very lucky from dividends from a corporation.
In the meantime, corporations are wholesale destroying the environment, communities and national sovereignty throughout the entire planet.

The simplest thing you can do - the passive thing :
Buy 0.1 BTC, convince everyone you know to do the same and then forget about it. Never check the price, ignore the news. One day, when you see it accepted by everyone every where, start using it to buy goods and services.
Less passive:
Refuse to budge, to do anything in the economy for compensation that is NOT BTC.

It's not satire. It's the new consciousness. It's all around you and easy to access.

For small amounts and for the privacy, it's usually fair.
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:17:07
By dabbling in those small amounts, I have been able to amplify my meager 'retirement income' to be somewhat dignified AND I will actually be able to leave my loved ones SOMETHING, although not much. Without dabbling small amounts in bitcoin I would only have been able to leave them petty debts.
Welcome aboard.
For what it's worth. I initially only built up my savings to 0.03BTC to be able to spend and replace.
I spend directly to my landlord, carers and food merchants from this, paying them directly in BTC. With my monthly pension, I buy the bitcoin I need to keep the balance above 0.03, taking into account upcoming expenses and leave the remaining fiat for fiat transactions, investing any leftover at the month's end  in Bitcoin to HODL for my children, grand children and great grand children. 
In time, a matrix shift occurred inside of me. So I now value things in BTC, or more accurately, Satoshi.
This month it cost me roughly 12,000 Satoshi per dollar spent for any fiat transactions I made. Needless to say, I have become more conscious of 'losing' Satoshi for trivial things, preferring to increase my Satoshi. I care little for any fiat value in my banks ledger.

It really is a shame the merica is gravitating towards a monopoly situation for trading in BTC.
Enough with pandering to immoral KYC and AML restrictions already !!!!
@_date: 2017-08-07 03:07:19
We have all been duped into thinking of bitcoin as something you buy and sell in fiat to seek greater net-worth (calculated in fiat) by 'investing' and 'speculating'.
It is a currency, which is safe and we can all agree upon. Let's start using it that way.
Start spending. Ask EVERYONE if they accept bitcoin. Help them download a wallet. Send them their first bitcoin. Replace your purchase with BTC purchased with fiat.
Ask for payment in bitcoin - incessantly. 
Spend and replace. Spend and replace. 
@_date: 2019-08-31 00:01:10
Countries that get it and would like to give their citizens an edge in the emerging new financial system make bitcoin tax exempt.
Countries that are intent on keeping their people poor make bitcoin and all aspects of it a taxable event.
@_date: 2017-08-31 02:48:00
Why don't you introduce it as a topic. See if your teacher can step up, do some research and maybe it can be an education point on fiat, how it is created etc. and that bitcoin is different in it's very creation.

Read them and you'll find that whatever they are 'considered' is irrelevant. And whoever is doing the considering either has an agenda or like you is too lazy to actually read the material before commenting on it. 
Basically, you have wrong information concerning these 2 books. Homeopathy is a specific field of medicine that was replaced by allopathy. That was all a very long time ago.
These 2 books represent the modern outook on human health and have nothing at all to do with 'homeopathy' even if your goooogle-filter-bubbled goooogle search told you so.
Read em. You might learn how to create health and keep it for yourself, from people who have actually done so in their own lives.
Humour me, what have you got to lose other than an already set in stone opinion?
@_date: 2018-06-10 13:35:42
True true true.
Unfortunately, most people live in shitty neighborhoods, actually believe the corporate messages and the crap they see on their book o da face feeds, and will actively argue that very same drivel to you as if it is THEIR thinking that produced it, in support of the schoolyard bully that oppresses them as well.

No, the beast has won 'this earth' a long time ago. All trade is already dominated on this earth. 
Open your eyes. It is all permissioned. All through third party - the beast. The corporatism we live in globally, WTO, IMF, World Bank etc.
You are part of the 4% who is permissioned, but the rest are NOT. That is why you can't see it.
You imagine this end time to be much worse than it is FOR YOU. But for most,it already IS that bad.
.Bitcoin is bringing in the rapture into the new earth, including the thousand years of peace, because we will remove the power of that select few to print money to wage fake war after fake war.

As a hedge, It's still an 'investment'.
And FYI, it isn't 'stable' at all. It's just that by fraudulent trickery, it is the currency to which all countries have to peg their currencies to.
I could have picked the swiss franc, the yuan, the euro.
The entire FX market is for investment, yet those currencies are also used as a medium of exchange.
I could waste more time arguing with you, but that was not my intention of the original post.
I've humoured you enough. Now will you do me the same courtesy of actually thinking about what I wrote in the original post with an open mind and trying to wrap your head around the possibility of a paradigm shift that happens within you when you decide to shift your perspective back to the perspective being used by the innovators and early enthusiasts, who clearly understood bitcoin to be a silent revolution in which we can all 'put our money where our mouths are' and thereby 'vote' for a positive future devoid of the current endless wars and oppression?
If you really do want to continue to argue with me in support of our common oppressors, I unfortunately really don't have the time.

Haven't heard if infowars, not sure who this Jones character is, I stay away from the lamestream media - it was corrupted a long time ago. 
I do however remember when the Rockefellar think tanks came up with the 'conspiracy theorist' label to pigeonhole and marginalize free thinkers. I guess it has become part of the repeater jargon. 
And, to be honest, I kinda feel flattered to be cast with that label, that lot, as the great thinkers, activists, philosophers, academics and rock musicians that that label was invented for have been proven by the passage of time to have been on the right side of history. I am honoured to 'be in their company'.
Look, subscribing to coincidence theory, repeating the crap we are all meant to believe and pigeon holing  everyone with THEIR label just because you haven't looked at the facts and the paper trails, doesn't make you superior, it just makes you feel superior.
Now, To answer your question:
I eat food grown by myself or others in my community, drink water I harvest by myself, heal through age old traditions based on exercise and breathing. I live in a jurisdiction outside of Umerca, where people are not yet poisoned or corrupted and are part of a 12,000 year old culture, which knows which plants cure and promote health and longevity. I associate with wise people who don't know enough english to have their minds polluted by erroneous media driven ideas. 
Please forgive me if My thinking is well outside of any box you've been given for people like me. I am in my 9th decade, I still work, walk roughly 12 miles, play with my great grand children and swim 3 miles in a natural (cold) river daily. I have a full head of hair, my skin is taught and supple, my breathing clear, easy and full.
I've beaten the western named dis-ease states known as hepatitis, malaria, yellow fever, cholera, typhoid and rheumatism.
I am just one of the first to arrive in this time of enlightenment and enjoy connecting with others who are younger and get it, through the magic of modern communications on the internet.
But really, I don't have the time or the want to 'convince' anyone of anything. I'm Just looking to connect with those from inside the matrix who can see the illusion and are already breaking it. 
If you'd like to learn more, I'd be more than willing, but 'debate', seriously ?!?!  I wish to spend time with my grand children too!! Not 'debating'. If I am going to debate, it will be about our existential nature or different methods to be free of the restrictions of the physical world, methods of spiritual ascension and so forth, not ideas from the media - which I haven't really consumed in 5 or 6 decades. 
That's all.
Enjoy and peace.

It's like experiencing the future of payments. Set yourself up with a lightning wallet from lightning labs and a blue wallet, which is custodial, to experience both ways of being on lightning. Put $20 on each. Then send satoshi back and forth to yourself. It is instant and costs nothing.
Everything else seems silly in comparison.
I have been doing most of my monthly payments in BTC for years already and now I hate doing non lightning payments. It's weird how your mind switches so quickly to something which is just more efficient and snappy.
Anyway, just sharing my experience and recommending having a go to be ahead of the adoption curve.

Mate, I'm more than familiar with the PR. I'm just questioning the doublespeak.
For example, every single one of these updated 'privacy policies' I've read - and I've read them all (the ones pertaining to me) - mentions oh so altruistically that I have the 'right' to withdraw consent to them 'processing' my data.. That in itself is hilarious. I don't ever recall giving my consent for any of these corporate clowns to 'process' my data in the first place, so how can I suddenly 'withdraw' that imaginary consent. 
It's all double speak designed to pull the wool over our eyes and get us to accept more corporate jurisdiction based on fraudulent wording.
There's heaps of that stuff in there. Makes for an interesting read. These EULA are not really that boring to read if you are looking for clues on how they are trying to blindside you.

Download lightning wallet from lightning labs AND blue wallet.  Then send done satoshi back and forth to yourself.
You'll get the feel of it.
Then organize a local merchant to also accept payment of bitcoin on lightning wallet in exchange for food/services etc.
Then come back here and let people know.
I think many people with loaded lightning wallets would send you a dollar - 8,000 satoshi.

Localbitscoins fraudulently went KYC on the whole community as us users are not their 'customers'.
At no point has any of us ever received an invoice from them or paid into their bank account.
There is no guarantee that paxful won't do the same.
I am recommending everyone to start supporting bisq as it is an honest attempt at decentralized fiat to bitcoin trades.
The ONLY downside being not enough users.
It is very simple to setup and start using.
Be aware that with P2P, whether it's on localbitcoins, paxful or bisq, there is always a risk with man in the middle attacks from unscrupulous users. Educate yourself on how this works and protect yourself from the possibility of it happening to you. 
Have a go.

If you are open for discussion on this and are prepared to have your mind open, I'll share with you my experiences with Africa, but I'm not here to argue with someone who's only point of reference about this continent is what you've been told without any direct experience.
Remember, 40 years ago in the middle of the cold war, children in the soviet block countries were coerced into finishing the food on their dinner plates by being guilted into it by there parents saying: 'think of all the starving children in the capitalist world.'
If you are prepared to understand that nothing is as it seems and that there are forces who are intent on having you believe certain versions of certain stories, I can elaborate what I have learned in my life of travels. If on the other hand you have your mind made up based on zero real knowledge, I really don't have the time to elaborate.

If you say so jack. The constant barraging of talk of markets, investment etc. The media arguing about what bitcoin REALLY is. Store of value, digital gold.new digital asset class etc.
All these things appeared out of nowhere. We all fell for it.
Bitcoin is none of those things. 
It is however, the first tool that humanity has ever had to completely obliterate the lockdown these people have had on humanity for millenia, in a peaceful silent way.
If we all just put our money where our hearts are and acquire the smallest amount, then start  paying each other in it, everything changes very quickly.
THEY lose their power to control us - thousand years of peace ushers in.
Try that one on. It does not even consider fiat or markets at all. It does consider world peace, the end of slavery, increased prosperity for all. Things that are far more compelling than  money.

Don't worry. You are correct in your sentence's meaning - unintentionally. 
While bitcoin adoption is inevitable and consistently expanding, you are right in a sense that bitcoin's only real competitor - the legacy financial system - will have to adapt to bitcoin.
Your use of the word adaption actually fits your comment, whereas your intention to use the word adoption but getting it wrong would have made your comment the usual nonsensical crap you see from all alt coin shills.

My friend, I understand your sentiments.
Please understand I am in my 9th decade. I have lost many friends and family - older, same age and younger than I - to some of these issues.
I also have a handful who beat all the scientific and medical odds.
For you, this is just academic jostling and verbal parlance.
To me, it is a choice between meeting my great grand children or not.
My compassion goes out to those who did not come across the methods in time or were resistant to them based on their beliefs of what is and what is not possible, but my love and tolerance allows all people to make their own choices on what they choose to believe.
I for one, wishing to stay in great health, do not have much choice, but to understand those that have achieved this and are scientific or medical anomalies, as they ALL tell me the same things. And THAT is not so much of an anomaly at all.
Not sure what you are talking about with the 'being positive or not' thing. I'm pretty sure it's not in reference to
anything I wrote. Kind of off track really, seems an odd thing to bring up. Unless you are meaning to straw-man the discussion of course.
Peace be with you.

It's your wording. When you used 'withdraw' it shows that your knowledge of Bitcoin and what it is, has severe holes.
It's like asking someone how to 'withdraw' their jamaican dollars to credit card.
Once you understand that Bitcoin is a currency, but vastly different from fiat currency like USD or JMD, then you'll ask for advice on ways to "exchange" bitcoin to JMD or USD and then use that currency to pay your credit card account.
We would all recommend you do some study on Bitcoin and what it is, why it exists and why it is important for the survival of humanity via the links in the side bar.

@_date: 2018-06-07 14:49:43
YOU can deny it is 'speculative' because you still view bitcoin in terms of it's value in fiat terms. But that is your personal subjective choice. 
Bitcoin is NOT viewed as speculative in an objective sense by Everyone.  
Once you understand the tech and put some skin in the game COMMENSURATE with your understanding of the tech, it is no longer speculative to you, but still viewed as speculative by others. 
Thus the whole discussion of speculative asset is completely subjective. We'll never get EVERYONE to agree on whether it is a speculative asset or not or even to what degree it is a speculative asset.
I have friend quite heavily invested in mining (in MY point of view, but he's insignificant in the larger picture of mining), who only buys dollars and holds them for payments he is expecting to make requiring fiat. It drives him nuts holding value in (from his perspective) the speculative asset we call fiat currency. THAT blows even my mind, but he's been in this for a while and he explains that it is simply easier and more accurate FOR HIM to do his math in that way.
Once you do the switch (internally), a bitcoin equals a bitcoin. There is no speculation there, it will always be one bitcoin. 
My argument with him is that even thenThere is speculation in fiat if you are having to track the changing costs of purchasing dollars with Satoshi. It's just the speculation is the other way around.

@_date: 2018-06-06 18:13:10
Sorry, but the analogy still stands.
I may not like heavy metal (and I don't, I'm just too old ��), but I am not going to pretend that, as music goes, it is NOT actually the top of the tree of modern musical development, just like Wagner was the height of classical music's development, while classical buffs usually prefer something more listenable like Beethoven. 
Contrary to popular belief, 'good' music is NOT about the opinion of the listener, but rather it is something quantifiable by musicians who have developed their talents and skills appropriately, similar to how a michelin chef is recognized as creating 'better' food than a McDonald's burger flipper. I for one prefer McDonald's.
What you are talking about is taste or musical preference. That is what decides popularity, not validity of good or bad music.
As much as I enjoyed the sex pistols back in the day and it still gives me the chills when I hear it, I am aware of their musical ineptitude. On the other hand I can listen to the Berlin Philharmonic performing carmina burana with the required thousand voices in perfect synch, appreciate the musical brilliance, yet be bored to tears. That would be subjective taste, and my untrained musicality doesn't somehow magically decide for everyone else what is 'good music' or not.
It's the same with crypto. It either is a cryptocurrency, running on distributed ledger cryptography, or it isn't. Cripple simply does NOT qualify, yet it is on the list. A token attached to the ETH chain is less valid that say verge, which actually has a decentralized chain, yet it is on the list. NONE of them even cone close to the validity of Bitcon.
The point being the marketcap measuring stick is just as feeble as the top 40 in music when it comes to the validity of crypto technology. It is, in short, a popularity contest, nothing more, nothing less.
That being said, I am with you 100% in waiting to see if bigger blocks are possible to scale a main chain or not - by real world experimentation. Yet pretending bcash IS Bitcoin just because the miners said so is an absolute travesty. It would be funny if it weren't so asinine.
@_date: 2019-10-28 05:37:27

The apparent 'bull run' is still seeing the world from a fiat-centric view point.
Whatever the number is that those in the fiat-centric perspective honour as 'the price' of Bitcoin, 1 BTC is still 1BTC.
Look, I too have to interact with fiat and believe me, it can be infuriating to have to let go of anywhere between 5,000 and 25,000 Satoshi per fiat USdollar because that 'market' is so damn volatile. But I deal with it and move on. It really is quite unimportant in the scheme of things.

It is permissioned and is based on fiat, which in itself is immoral.
If paypal were to start running on BTC in the background, that would of course change.
Same goes for visa and mastercard and banking etc.
They are just third party payment mechanisms. The currency they chose to run on says more about their ethical foundation than it does about anything else.

Up to you. 
Of course I saw the news, and just to correct what you are trying to say, the long queues were for people trying to get those notes into bank accounts, not withdraw. But I know that's what you meant to say.
That being said, I was in India on 3 different occasions over the last year. And as much as the gov 'banned' their own issued 500 and 1000 rupee notes, it is those very notes that I spent to get my daily meals, accommodation and trinkets.
Gov bans mean very little to the vast majority of the population in india, it ain't Kansas.

I haven't seen a shred of credible evidence to support your illusions.
Mate, it's not like I didn't used to subscribe to the same views that you believe are your own. I, like you, also used to vehemenently argue for them.  It is the default program view that ALL of us are brought up with in this paradigm and are expected to carry on believing. There is nothing about it that is unusual or uncommon or original. EVERYONE starts out believing this drivel.
The difference is that some of us question it , self educate, experiment with reality and eventually come to our own conclusions - or not - maybe leaving ANY belief suspended, knowing full well that NO ONE has figured anything out yet. 
Which is completely contrary to the comfortable idea that science, the authorities,big business, goooogle-filter-bubble-search, the academics etc. (or somebody) has a clue at all.
I'm sorry if you feel so threatened by me because the standard beliefs to which you subscribe so unquestioningly to (just because they are the default, and your gooooogle search capabilities support them) now seem ludicrous to me or anyone else who has left the matrix.
I didn't make the rules, I just learned how they function.

Read through the while thread. It is addressed elsewhere to another commenter.
@_date: 2018-06-07 01:33:28
It's simple. 
If you have a limited understanding of the technology, you are 100% correct. In that case, it is not only a VERY speculative asset, but more accurately a straight up stupid gamble. 
If on the other hand you make your decisions on 'what Bitcoin is' commensurate with your understanding of the technology, it can be a very good and resilient store of value, an income generator (by mining), or a straight up super ROI investment over time.
You've just bought the line that Bitcoin is some kind of 'speculative asset', created by people who haven't a clue 'what Bitcoin is'. That's all. 
That idea is holding YOU back, not those of us who have already been storing our value in Bitcoin for years.
You can present me any argument you like, but my experience and my increased spending ability since I started to do this will speak speak much louder than your words.
Remember, the people who understand the tech better than you or I have collectively invested Billions of DOLLARS into Bitcoin via real world infrastructure. Are they stupid to not listen to the lamestream talking heads or dumbed down billionaire 'master investors' like Warren Buffet?
Sometimes in life we need to accept that there are others out there who know more than we do, suspend our oh so important 'opinions', put the learning cap back on, put our ego into our back pockets and FOLLOW those that have better understanding and information than we think we have.
Based on your comments, which expose extreme ignorance, This is most likely one of those times for you.

I always pray that despite the lamestream media propaganda about Pakistan, that this thread if enlightenment still exists there.

I've been spending bitcoin to cover most of my monthly bills for years already. I've always used it as money.
I'm an old timer and generally make the same payments month in and month out to the same people and businesses, so I'm not your average consumer by a ling shot.
For me bitcoin offers tremendous utility, it makes my meager retirement income more dignified, I can easily send money to my grandkids overseas etc., bit mostly, it just simplifies my life - no check book to balance, no bank statements to stay on top of. I just sit down on the 3rd of every month with a cup of coffee and make almost all my payments while the cup is still warm.

My God that is delusional. You realize Bitcoin is global, right? The amount if bitcoin being held by Umercans is a fraction of the mined supply. The home if the slave And land of the fee is so far behind in bitcoin HODLing, you have no idea.
You AmeriCAN'Ts actually believe that Bitcoin OR bcash OR any crypto are some kind of digital commodity that gets bought and sold and valued in fiat terms. That's even more delusional than thinking that ANYONE outside of r/btc has even heard of bitcoin cash (if they've heard of anything, it's that thing bcash, one of the many bitcoin forks).
Mate, get a grip. There's real people out here (in the world) that NEED bitcoin, for them it's not some kind of ego fest side picking sports event where you shill your team.

Bla bla bla.
What you are referring to is holding, as you do with any investment you are holding to hopefully realize a return on sale of that investment. 
HODLing is buying bitcoin and holding on until it is ubiquitous and it is what we spend in exchange for goods and services instead of fiat.

Look up the babypips school of pipsology. 
It's an online school for forex trading which will teach you about reading charts and trading.
It's all about forex, but it's all the same in crypto as far as market behaviour goes.
That being said, do so for your own education. And for sure have a go at trading with very small amounts - for your education - but as others have advised you here, it really is smartest to stay on a strategy of HODL by CDA - Cost Dollar Averaging.

Thank you for keeping this up in front of us.
It is vitally important.
Ignore the brain dead who don't get it and only repeat the same old bullshit (that all of us hear constantly and are expected to believe) as if it is some kind if original thinking.
It is this silent revolution where, by choice, we simply remove our participation in their fraudulent debt based system which benefits only 0.0001% of the world's population. By using BTC and saving in BTC, we are using human kind's first and only real weapon to disrupt their power over us.
Unfortunately we have to battle the opinionated fools all around us who actively support their oppressors, sticking up for the schoolyard bully while the rest of the class is slowly understanding the collective power they wield.
Again, keep up the good work, it is very much appreciated. Ignore the flack.

Because most of us are here to educate the dumbed down fools who believe the bankster backed media fed narrative that bitcoin is some kind of investment in a digital asset/store of value that gets bought/sold/valued in fiat dollars and really don't care about how many satoshi a dollar costs today.
Bitcoin is NOT an investment.
Bitcoin IS the silent bloodless revolution to end all fake war, fake news, fake people, fake governments, fake business, fake economy and real mass surveillance and real tyranny.

@_date: 2019-08-26 02:36:58
I was at a market yesterday at a stall that had a 'Bitcoin accepted here' sign and a customer stepped up and said, 'that would be an expensive purchase in Bitcoin.'  
I asked why they would say that and the answer was: 'because in 10 years Bitcoin is going to be worth 50 times as much.'
This is very much the current understanding. Despite all the bizarre false narratives from the bankster media and the fake corpcoin chains still hanging onto the bitcoin name, people are viewing Bitcoin as a place to store wealth safely.
It turns out he had bitcoin, but no way to access it, being all locked up in high security 'cold storage'. Kinda sad in that he'd never really enjoyed the functionality and utility of bitcoin. 
As much as I appreciate people HODLing - AND I DO - for those of us who have graduated to spend and replace, it seems absurd to avoid spending bitcoin when it is so easy to replace.
Thank God the conversation immediately went to lightning network, which he'd only heard of, but never looked into. It was interesting watching him light up when the vendor explained that  using Bitcoin on lightning as spend and replace is the future. Yes, keep your savings, but start putting your fiat spending money into lightning channels and spending it, even if you are using a simplified 'custodial solution', because the creation of Bitcoin itself is NOT custodial.
That's when I stepped in and made another purchase (of some cheese that I did not need), to help demonstrate.
I really do think it is these simple real life interactions that is driving Bitcoin's morphing into payments on second layer.
Is this the new organically growing understanding?  That Bitcoin base layer is where you store your value and lightning is where you spend and replace from?
Is the real lucrative business model that is emerging going to be exchanges and/or BTC ATM machines that facilitate low value sales of fiat in to BTC directly into lightning?

You'll find that many transactions will start to 'disappear' because they are being done on lightning. 
I have been All In on bitcoin for years now and transact a few times a day. Now that my landlord and csa farm and pub are on lightning, I hardly ever do onchain transaction anymore.
I'm just one guy, but I'm getting hundreds of my transactions without burdening the blockchain at all.
Granted, a lot of the transacting is with exchanges, but they are in a race to implement lightning AND liquid. That will help. Plus batching seems to be standard now.

100% certain there's not a quarter of a million bcash users. Look at the daily transaction  count, look at active addresses etc.  you seriously judge the size of any community by reddit subscriptions ?!?!? 
You need to go back to school mate!
That's like saying there's only 1 million Bitcoin users because r/bitcoin has 1 million subscribers. Real research suggests over 18 million users and growing by a million users a month. Again, look at daily transaction volumes, active addresses, number of addresses with more than 0.1 BTC etc 
That hijacked sub is almost all bots and people like me who got banned there for pointing out the corporate false narratives and haven't bothered unsubscribing.
ANYONE who spends more than 30 minutes in that desperate lonely corner of the internet, can clearly see that EVERY SINGLE THREAD is dominated by the same 50 user names who seem to be able to post 24/7 without need for breaks or sleep. They feel the need to either keep the false corporate narratives alive or they are just repeating to each other to console each other because they are the last of the bcash bagholders.
And no, a shitty little town full of inbreds in N Queensland with 98 bcash accepting merchants is not 'adoption'.
There was no 'split' in the community. There was a failed corporate takeover attempt - segwit X2 - and there was a copy/paste/proprietorize of the code by corporate interests looking to appeal to the handful of consumer mindset bitcoin users that simply didn't get what they were part of (an open source collaborative project to bring peer 2 peer electronic cash to the world) and needed SOMEONE IN CHARGE, a 'roadmap', developers that are 'beholden to deadlines' etc to deliver to them their 'product' on time as promised - not in 18 months damn it !!
Saint Bitts LLC puts out all the slogans and corporate bcash narratives, controls bitcoindotCON, the twitter handle, 'development' (read cut and paste from BTC development) , all new ideas, loaclbcash exchange etc.
I recommend you get involved and stop reading uninformed uneducated bullshit on twitter.

You'll learn a heap.

My assessment is purely anecdotal. I know a few miners - small time compared to the pics you see floating around, but still invested in the millions of dollars.
Not a single one of them has sold any BTC or is willing to do so for less than 15K.
I'm pretty sure 'the price' in dollar terms is being kept there by the same BTC going around in circles on exchanges that may or may not even have those physical bitcoins in the first place.

I think he's referring to Saint Bitts LLC. It's the company registered behind the bitcoindotCON and ALL activity related to bcash, whether it's marketing (scamming), 'development', most of the mining etc.
The whole point of Bitcoin is that it is the world's first and ONLY bossless medium of exchange in world history.
Many people are rightly quite upset about the attempted corporatization of Bitcoin behind the bitcoin cash fiasco. It is normally referred to as bcash, but the corporate leaders find this term offensive as their failed marketing attempt was to brand bcash as THE REAL BITCOIN.
In any case, it is Saint Bitts LLC who is behind the wallet that caused you confusion.
Everything to do with them is best avoided and it is worth spreading the word to help minimize their attack surface.

I know it's the answer they were fishing for. Observe how the tech changes. It cracks me up this math that gets spouted about, yet expecting people to propagate AND store a new 200GB every 10 minutes somehow is mathematical reality.
I've done hundreds of transactions on LN, which normally I would have done online this month.
It simply makes sense in practice RIGHT NOW.  With the growth in tech taking place, I'm sure it will continue making sense in practice as we move towards this 'onboarding' of billions.
Lightning is just one option growing out of layer 2. There will be many. It is not the be all and end all solution. 
@_date: 2019-02-14 12:09:34
Cash app is irrelevant to over 80% of btc holders because the vast majority of them are not in Umerca.
Custodial LN wallets are ok. 
The money creation is not AND non-custodial options exist and are POSSIBLE. This is important.
Look at how many people use custodial communications services like gmail, fb, twitter etc
What is of Prime importance is that THE MONEY is not Permissioned on the base layer. Have a look at the colossal failure of bcash bosscoin. It proved to the world that custodial boss led crypto is treacherous.
Layer 2, 3, 4,  go ahead, be a visa or even a bank. Doesn't matter. Users can still CHOOSE to use custodial or not, like many people have custodial wallets right now. The point is that the ChoICE is there.
Lightning is a tremendous bit of layer 2 tech that is inherently NOT custodial, yet leaves room and opportunity for millions of custodial services to develop as well as millions of non-custodial services as well.
@_date: 2019-02-04 06:54:58

It's a bosscoin, both versions. It started that way and ended that way. Centralized decision making, mining and ownership was proven by the bcash experiment to be a failure model in the crypto space.
Now what would be interesting is an actual consensus driven open source crypto that actually attracts talented developers running the big block experiment.
But alas, talented developers can do math, so they would probably not be interested in wasting their time.
Bitcoin is the only bossless medium of exchange in world history. Bossless LN helps with fungibility and gives it instant cashlike properties on top of that.

Adoption didn't reverse.
That is also a false narrative put out by Saint Bitts LLC.
Even though Steam and Microsoft (there is no etc.) dropped accepting BTC, it is not like they started accepting another 'faster cheaper than Bitcoin' alternative. They did not stop 'because of high fees'. There were corporate tax issues that made life way too complicated at that point. Period.
That Narrative is so weak.
While they dropped accepting crypto, adoption globally has sky rocketed.
In 2014, it was hard to travel on Bitcoin. Now, you can go virtually anywhere in Australasia and spend only BTC without having to convert to fiat.
I don't call that 'reverse adoption'.
Hundreds of thousands of transactions per day onchain and an incalculable amount offchain, does NOT represent 'reverse adoption'. 
Again, like most fools who drank the Saint Bitts LLC false corporate narrative cool-aid, you have no original thought capacity. It may be why your personal investment value has dropped by 97% - which is 3% away from NADA - zero.
Your current belief in corporate propaganda will only cost you more. Repeating their lies does not make them true OR save your bags.
The public ledger that is slowly stopping corruption in governments and bringing justice to the world is functioning strongly in the ONLY secure Blockchain in existence, representing the ONLY bossless medium of exchange in world history. It's called Bitcoin - but you know that.
You are just butt hurt because you believed corporate charlatans about the flippening fantasy.
I wish you the best of luck in your wake up.

Good idea. I was in penang a couple years ago and asked a guy if he took bitcoin. 
He said 'Bitcoin, i like very much.'
I was like, great let's transact.
He said 'cannot, i no have bitcoin'
Eventually i realized that in his mind bitcoin was something you needed permission for. I had a blast walking him through downloading a wallet, writing down the seed and sending him the $30 I owed him.
The look on his face was priceless -seeing bitcoin on his phone with zero hassle or permission.
I'd really like to go back and find him because that BTC even today is over $100.

- The 'scaling debate' was fake and pushed by corporate interests intent in taking over BTC.
- Most bitcoin users understood that Bitcoin is an open source collaboration where there are no 'debates' which then are decided in a top down corporate fashion and then dictated, but rather that decisions are made by voting - by running which ever client you personally think is the best path forward.
- The corporate method failed.
- The constant tiresome corporate false narratives being repeated over and over by the same posters were eventually blocked from rbitcoin. Thank God, it Was so boring. Never adding Nothing new to their tired 'debate'.
- These 50 odd 'banned' users Invaded the BTC sub which Saint Bitts LLC now owned and continued spouting the same false corporate narratives about some 'debate' and 'censorship' while outright censoring any actual discussion about BTC. 
- The few Bitcoin users who never understood the open source collaborative nature of Bitcoin and Nakamoto consensus, indignantly wanted SOMEONE IN CHARGE to deliver them what they felt they were promised by SOMEONE UP THERE  (which must be core/AXA/blockstream) were all fooled by a corpcoin fork of Bitcoin, which was forked by the same crybaby corporations who dismally failed in taking over BTC. 
- That fork is commonly known as bcash, but the corporate bosses find that an insult. 
- These top-down consumer minded bitcoiners were happy to finally have SOMEONE in charge who told them what to think and what to repeat ad nauseum with the promise of a 'flippening', where somehow magically their corporate centralized fork of Bitcoin would BECOME  Bitcoin.
- Some of them very publicly actually gave up being dollar billionaires by selling all their BTC  for bcash - Rick Falkvinge (sp?) comes to mind. How do you lose a billion dollars ? Ask Rick.
- These people are 97% down on their investment because they not only believed corporate lies, but willingly repeated them.
- The corpcoin bosses had a falling out and forked again, forcing these corporate model follower consumer type bcash users to choose between their beloved bosses. They still infight about this constantly.
- They constantly wind themselves up over BTC/LN constant transparent push forward, which as it is open source development, has all flaws and clunkiness out in the open as it is being developed, pointing their indignant fingers at something they simply cannot comprehend developing before all of our very eyes, as a collaborative open source effort.
- They continue in that rut to this day stuck in the past, while the world has moved on without them, leaving rbtc as a lonely desperate corner if the internet with the same 50 user names dominating every post's discussion with the same old tired false narratives.

BCH 'adoption' will always lag behind bitcoin. 'Selling' BCH to corporations is a joke. PEOPLE - not corporations - choose to adopt. Corporations are slow lumbering inefficient things that can't change very quickly.
People and corporations looking into adopting crypto will do the research, realize the long term folly of big blocks and the dangers if centralized mining power and then using their intelligence, will adopt bitcoin.
Simple as that.
Dash has an actual sales force out there gaining corporate adoption, they still aren't bitcoin.

'Is transacting' - now that's pretty funny.
Being a centralized bosscoin like bcash and the rest, I am sure it CAN transact many per second. Centralization has it's benefits. Just look at what visa (NANO's competitor) can do.
The point is not that it CAN, but that it doesn't.
The space is full of bosscoins which claim to be able to scale, but haven't had any scale to test them and NO, 'stress tests' don't count. Bitcoin is scaling, so it bumps into that scaling limits.
Why is bitcoin growing so fast?
One reason ONLY:
It is the world's first and only bossless medium of exchange in human history. This is the ONLY reason people outside of Umerca (ie the real world) are enamoured with it.
No one internationally is interested in replacing the old boss (banksters) with a new boss (latest amazing 'better than bitcoin' crypto team's website).  
If you think the rest of the world is as quick to worship corporations and financial hotshots as quick as Umercans have been programmed to do, you need to broaden your world view. Get a passport, go somewhere. Anywhere.

There's heaps of copy coins, shitcoins and corpcoins with the bitcoin name and most have been forked from bitcoin and share the genesis block.
But let's be realistic.
There's only one Bitcoin.
As in the leaderless one.
The world's first and ONLY bossless medium of exchange in history.
The one that is grabbing people's attention worldwide (read outside if dumbed down Umerca) for that reason alone. Ungameable money. 
This one quality that makes Bitcoin unique, is what has people enamoured with it globally. People don't give a shit if it's digital or not.
What they thirst for is a medium of exchange that isn't owned and controlled by white suits., or anyone else for that matter. This is what makes Bitcoin unique.

Exactly why it's easier to just call it bcash for simplicity. It is just easier to explain to new users what is going on.
As soon as you try to explain the whole forking bitcoin cash thing the eyes glaze over. It's just too much to explain.
So, short and sweet: there's this thing called bitcoin. It works like this. As a result of this amazing technological advance there are now many copies, which are not decentralized consensus driven. We call those alt  coins because they theoretically can be shut down. Bcash is one of those.
This  is why as far as the greater public is concerned it is slowly becoming known as bcash.
Deal with it.

Yeah, I remember. It does hit you. Your brain shifts gears, everything looks and feels different, reality is heightened.
It happened to me too. I got in because my landlord and grand daughter conspired to make me pay my rent in BTC. I obliged as I could think of no excuse to resist them besides being too lazy to learn something new.
Slowly, after my first few payments, when I kept seeing the dollar value of the btc in the wallet changing, i started to become interested. I watched all of AA talks and started to read. 
Then suddenly one day, it hit me. I realized that Bitcoin is the first real tool humanity has ever had to get out from under the bankster yoke we've been harnessed by for millennia.  The idea of trustlessness was firmly gelled in my brain. Everywhere I looked, everything was different.
I felt like i was slipped back to now from a future reality, but had that future's perspective.  The clunkiness and fog of the standard world view was gone and I could see that all of my friends were still in it.
I had updated my OS and I was on fire. I lost a lot of sleep in those days.  
When your mind makes this paradigm shift, it really shifts.

However, for those of us ahead of the tech curve, what you are saying sounds so unbelievably disingenuous it's just pathetic.
I opened 8 channels, total fees less than 34 cents for the lot and have since done thousands of transactions to and fro with those channels.
LN is not THE ONLY SCALING SOLUTION ON BTC as sone lame Saint Bitts LLC sponsored corporate narratives will have you believe, but rather an interesting bit of tech on the second layer of BTC, in fact the first bit of tech on that layer. 
And at thousands of transactions at less than 34 cents, I'm ok with it so far.

It has nothing to do with free speech. It is a twitter handle. 
I'm pretty sure if I used  to promote my version of the real kelloggs cereal, twitter would have to do something about it. And no one would be violating anyone's free speech.
Bitcoin however is not a trademark and is bossless and unowned, so Bitcoin cannot press charges.
The point is that THE REASON used to cancel your kelloggs handle (in above example) would be that you are deceptively profiting from the kellogs brand.
It could be argued that bitcoin, even it is bossless and ownerless is a brand.
It could also be argued that one of the bcash bosses is using the bitcoin handle to deceptively profit from the bitcoin brand and attempts to trick new users into purchasing something other than bitcoin - as it is commonly referred to by the general public.
Is it possible that twitter actually has a corporate social responsibility to stop fraudulent use of twitter handles?
Revoking his handle in no way infringes his right to free speech.

And until someone posts a method by which this is actually possible, I'm calling bullshit.
On the other hand it would be a piece of cake to monitor ALL bcash transactions because ALL users, who have been discouraged from being involved in the network by running a node, use SPV wallet which have to trust 3 verification nodes.

The cognitive dissonance over there is unreal. 
I've also noticed There are supposedly 1,500 people online at any one point, but the posts, as few as they are, are from the same 10 posters every day.
And the comments seem to be from some kind of upvote/downvote, very committed shill campaign by about 25 different users.
There is little to no news on what they are trying to accomplish, besides a few very embarrassing (for them) 'tech' posts from their completely dictatorial, centralized, bosscoin 'development' squad that seem to understand very little about computer science.
It is all about weird bashing on bitcoin and lightning. 
I do find myself lurking there for the entertainment quite a bit, but for real news of development and adoption this sub reigns.
Bcash is a sinking ship.
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:06:16
That's good news. There is an obvious market out there, let's see some healthy competition. 
@_date: 2019-06-08 08:59:17
The entire article is based on the Bitpay experience.
I know heaps of merchants who just use direct wallet now. They haven't stopped accepting bitcoin, they've just become their own bank - in a small way. 
Where I live cash is still like 99.9% of all transactions, so we aren't talking about anything huge here.
I just find the anti-adoption narrative soooo funny. 5 years ago, i couldn't spend anywhere off line, now I can pretty much handle all of my monthly expenses via simple bitcoin transactions, both onchain and via LN.
@_date: 2019-02-13 01:38:57
Where do I go to get a picture of this 'core', a full list of contributor names, their minutes from their meetings etc.
Bitcoin has a github, an open source collaboration. 
You too could be 'core' if you had the chops.
There is no cohesive 'core' organization. There is no owner.
Bitcoin is bossless.

I like the idea of the alternate topic. It always feels good having a little bag of gold coins on you like in the old days.
For transfers you can use LN or any number of the exciting technologies being proposed, which will come online and for large transactions, onchain.
All the while able to operate a few full nodes yourself, one on each device because it isn't bloated to buggery by one entity's sub cent transactions.
Sounds like commerce could be fun again.

You only lose fiat if you buy it back at higher than you sold it at. 
But if you hold onto your BTC, you always have 'money'.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:20:45
I think he is referring to the proper corrections we used to have like from $450 to $280 in a few minutes.
What we are experiencing now is part correction but mostly the market effects of the attack in progress.
Bitcoin will 'correct' upwards after the attackers get tired of fighting the money badger.

This. If you have a low interest rate, it makes no sense to pay it out. The interest and money you pay becomes worth less and less every year while the btc increases in value.

0.7 Satoshi for a Vietnamese Dong.
1.28 Satoshi for an Indonesian Rupiah
 12.3 Satoshi for a Myanmar Kyat
146 Satoshi for Japanese Yen.
160 Satoshi per Nepalese Rupee 
320 Satoshi for a Philippine Peso.  
500 Satoshi for a Thai Baht
873 Satoshi for a Mexican Peso.
These are significant populations - well beyond The US and Europe combined - who are increasingly technology obsessed and well aware of inflation and banking stealing your savings from you, which are not that far off parity to Satoshi.
@_date: 2019-06-02 06:12:59
Just slander and repeater bullshit. You have added nothing. 
The N Queensland merchant having their transaction reversed is just something I know about through a family freind. And no IT DOES NOT SHOW UP ON A BLOCK EXPLORER  BECAUSE THE HISTORY WAS CHANGED. The transaction not longer exists BECAUSE OF 2 people. 
It was NOT a double spend. It was a spend WHICH WAS ERASED BY THE DECISION OF 2 PEOPLE.
Your reference to the 2013 event is silly and unbelievably deceitful.  The size of the network was tiny. I know, I was there. At that time there wasn't even a GUI wallet yet, every user had to have the full blockchain, no SPV wallets and the tech was extremely experimental. A whole different ballgame than today AND IT REQUIRED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE NNOT TWO !!!!!!!
You just spew The usual disingenuous bcash corporate bullshit. 
Have you ever had a single original thought.
It'd be great to see you sign a transaction for your fake screenshot. And no, it won't cost you $50 or $100. Again, someone who obviously doesn't transact. You are simply a lying fool, getting poorer daily due to falling for the Saint Bitts LLC corporate narratives.

You are right THEIR attack on the planet is multipronged and we have to be vigilant on all fronts.

Rest assured, Asia is into Bitcoin. If you are lucky enough to find someone who even knows about crypto, they don't know about bcoin. They know bitcoin and that there's a bunch of other imitators.
Asians KNOW the dangers of trusting gov or centralization. They KNOW what it's like when external forces attack you.
1997 Asian crash was caused by ONE person - George Soros. Asians are very familiar with cabals uniting to steal from the rest of the population.
India has more gold on the ear rings, anklets and bracelets of their children than the rest of the world combined.
They know.
Asia will not fall for a bcoin scam. When they get wind of bitcoin, they GET IT immediately. 
The general Asian community is much more intelligent and savvy than the western countries.

0.7 Satoshi for a Vietnamese Dong.
1.28 Satoshi for an Indonesian Rupiah
 12.3 Satoshi for a Myanmar Kyat
146 Satoshi for Japanese Yen.
160 Satoshi per Nepalese Rupee

O the other hand, I've been trying to spend my bcash since the fork. It's hard enough to find anyone who's even heard of it, let alone accept it or take it seriously.

It'll be the standard and all other currencies will be incredibly inflationary against it.

Many of us do this already. I've been 'all in' for a few years now and find that I think in Satoshi. 
So for the past couple months, I've been doing whatever I can to collect fiat debts, pick up extra work, sell things I don't need, etc. to sell the fiat for satoshi - because right now, believe me, Satoshi are cheap. 
Anything under 20,000 satoshi for a dollar, it's back to spend and replace.
Because my time, efforts and sale of things gets stored in satoshi,  I develop my own feeling for how many Satoshi I am willing to part with on any given purchase.
I find it is something your mind does all by itself once you are all in.

You are talking about banksters/regulations/governments trying to hold back bitcoin on their side of the equation. That has nothing to do with the usability of bitcoin wallet UX.
In most countries, this is not an issue.

How fast does it take to transact in dollars? Depends how you are transacting and where and with whom.
Is it the dollar's responsibility to ensure 'fast transactions'?
Visa transacts in dollars, in yen, in euro, in peso in ......
In Time they will be forced to transact in bitcoin as well.
Bitcoin is a currency, not some update to payment processing systems.
That is the narrative that is being sold through all this 'scaling debate'.
Bcash is part of that. The banksters want us to think of bitcoin as a settlement platform NOT as a currency - especially one that threatens to replace their monopoly on money creation.
Don't fall for it.

It's not an investment. It's a more sound form of money than fiat, so it makes sense to keep your liquidity in bitcoin. Where the value of that liquidity actually increases. Keeping fiat in a bank account also is not an investment and would decrease the value of your liquid assets over time.

This ain't a  bcash dictatorship run by one guy. That project is set up as a corporate structure with bosses, like all the boss coins, they CAN 'go after' someone.
Bitcoin is completely different, being the only bossless medium of exchange in world history. There is no entity called 'core' which exists in a legal sense to be able to 'gi after' anyone.
In fact, if you had the chops, you too could be 'core', let that sink in.

Look at how much work DAsh does on signing up merchants. They actually have a sales force and STILL, they aren't bitcoin.
Without the spam attacks and the miner switching, transactions are quite cheap.
Just a few weeks ago, I was paying under 20 cents. That is reasonable.
Don't let THEIR efforts to slow the bitcoin network down to congest it and 'prove' that it's slow fool you.
It is currently congested, expensive and slow prcisely because of the bcoin attacks.

That's it. That's all. Ease of use, good UX,  the tech etc. are not important to them.

Problem Is they will have to change. They will no longer have an open ended ledger with the power to enslave the as yet unborn.
Boo hoo hoo, gov has to become efficient and service oriented. Maybe think before starting wars, maybe save some money by NOT tracking everything on the net and trying to control the conversation, etc.
Maybe they will start to fulfill the functions they are supposed to fulfill and get out if all of your lives.

You haven't read many things if you think calling an alt coin by the name the general public calls it is somehow dumb.
Everyone outside of the bcash shills calls it bcash. That is what it's name is. Normal people are not interested in any debate from an insignificant small group of people trying to coopt the bitcoin brand. They call it bcash to avoid confusion. Deal with it.

It's the dollar that fluctuates because they print it like crazy and all the fiat is tied to it.

No, they are quite opposite. 
A hub is how things work in a hierarchical centralized system. You need hubs in that architecture, be it economic, corporate or social. Hubs and spokes. It is what we've always known. All of society is setup in a hub and spoke framework.
It can be tricky when we switch our minds into decentralized architecture which looks like a net in 3D. That's why the participants are called nodes.
You might have lots of supernodes, with lots of liquidity, but it still would look more like a 3D net with clumpy parts.
But no one is beholden to use any particular node.
I think a market will develop where nodes are built into IOT devices. Maybe your fridge will have it's own node and your home entertainment center another.
I think everyone is trying to imagine the possibilities this opens up in a SDWE (pronounced 'said We' Satoshi Denominated World Economy).
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:35:47

I haven't paid over a dollar ever. And I actually use bitcoin AS a currency. Been spend and replacing for 2 years.
This high transaction fees is a fallacy. All because of spam.
When fees are artificially high, wait a day or 2 before transacting. Put in a zero or low fee and wait. Whatever.
When the spam attacks and forkings and all the other banker backed attempts to control the network or coerce people to an alt coin stop, fees will be just fine.
Stop with the silly fee FUD.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:04:21
Wasn't it always bcash and they are trying to call it bitcoin cash?
@_date: 2019-06-01 04:37:48
No, not denying it, just saying it absolutely is not necessary to pay such a high fee. I just sent a transaction right now for less than 1 cent because The receiver is in no great hurry and agreed to my experiment.
It has already cleared.
If people choose to tip the waitress at Pizza Hut $50, that literally is their choice, it has nothing to do with 'the cost' of pizza hut's service.
In BTC, it is very much the same.
That there are 40,000 transactions that paid a $50 fee in May, is simply that user deciding it is worth it to move their BTC, seeing it is THE ONLY secure blockchain in existence.
There's people out there with bigger bucks that you and I mate and if they want to pay extra, it is their freedom to do so.
The whole point is people are WILLING to pay for the security they receive using BTC -the ONLY bossless medium of exchange in history.
I know a merchant in N Queensland Australia who got royally screwed over a few weeks ago because she accepted 3 0-conf transactions on the corpcoin imposter fork believing that fees matter and those transactions got rolled back as a result of 2 people deciding they would roll back a block chain. Yes 2 (two) people.
That would NEVER be possible on BTC, because it is bossless.
That merchant will never use the fake corpcoin again, has learned her lesson that this had nothing to do with fees, but rather SECURE P2P electronic cash for the world.
By the way, love the fake screenshots. If I had the time I'd do one for you too - faketoshi style.

LOL. Like bitcoin has to 'compete' with credit cards.
Bitcoin is a currency, not a payment network. Why aren't you complaining that the Euro or the Dollar aren't competing with credit cards. I hear the Yen is very competitive with visa at the moment ?!?!?! Just bizarre way of thinking.
In time credit cards will be forced to use bitcoin because bitcoin is the safe, decentralized, permission-less currency of choice.
NOT the other way around. You sound like a confused bcash fool who thinks this is about competing with payment processors.
Build a solid reliable un-manipulatable (by banksters or miners) currency and the payment processor businesses can compete with each other in fees and services. 
The instant payment you are looking for WILL be second and third layer payment processors, just like they are now with fiat.
The Difference is that they cannot create more bitcoin out of thin air like they do with fiat. Be ware the centralized alt coin merchants who will have you believe otherwise.
Use the alt coins for their payments facility because they are low transaction, while you still can while they are low transaction, and store your savings in bitcoin - the central world currency of the future. The short sighted alts who see themselves as a kind of paypal, will have serious scaling problems that will only be solved by further centralization, becoming a trusted currency that is controlled by a few - may as well stick with fiat.
HODL bitcoin until it IS the central world currency that we can all trust because it is open source, permissionless, borderless etc.
Hope that clears up your brain fart for you.

My Utopia exists in most places outside of Umerca.
It is the reason the criminals that run your shop keep taking your money to oppress and murder us - those who live in low tax, peaceful community oriented Utopia.
You godless American'ts have been led so down far the garden path and dumbed down into oblivion that you probably never even considered having a look around outside of your fee ridden slave society.
AND you actually believe you live in the greatest nation on earth. Now THAT is hilarious.
Enjoy your land of the fee, home of the slave if you want. Just stop taking everyone else's stuff already.

But that's not a fork. That's just bitcoin. How do i claim my bitcoin core? Is there a wallet for it. I can't find a single reference to it anywhere.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:29:14
I agree, it's not that big a deal.
I just find it easier when helping new users through the brainfart learning curve to call it bcash.
I find this is generally the case and the reason so many people now call it bcash.
It is what people refer to it as.

You may value bitcoin in fiat. I dropped that way of thinking long ago. I am only concerned with what fiat costs me in Satoshi.

Just one thing to correct. Amway is NOT a pyramid. Whether you like the idea of MLM is irrelevant, I don't particularly care for it, but it is still the most fair and most efficient way to get a mass produced product into the hands of the consumer.
I get the point though. All money is a form of agreed upon ponzi in a sense.
The war against fiat is about removing the facility for a small group of people to create money out of thin air.
This is the important point and YES fiat is a huge mega bubble.
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:05:35
Pretty lame when your coin's tech is so inferior that you have to attack bitcoin.

Also, in the article, they refer to Bitcoin as bitcoin legacy. There is no such thing.
There's Bitcoin and there are alt coins.

Real open source voluntary reviews and submissions of actual code by actual real developers who have to compete with each other on a merit based system to come up with the best ideas.
Works for other open source projects. 
Unlimited/bcash/sX2 group of dumbed down rich guys backed by evil banksters are only interested in being part of the multi generational super class that calls themselves the money masters.
The question is: what is bcash doing to solve it's scaling issues?
There comes a point where the gigabyte blocks are too big even for the centralized nodes to handle. Good luck with that.
@_date: 2017-11-25 02:44:29
Girl, read through the whole sticky at the top of this sub and related links. There's hours worth of study there. Watch everything on Andreas antonopolous utube channel.
Once you understand the technology and why bitcoin exists, you'll understand why only those that don't get the tech call it a bubble.
It really is a matter of perception. 
Those that think they know everything because they are entrenched in the fraudulent, unjust legacy financial 'system'. And those that are smart enough or diligent enough to really understand money and the technology behind bitcoin.
Kind of a rich man , eye of needle thing.

Not that it is relevant to the rest of us outside of Umerca, but please please please exercise democracy by contacting your reps on mass instead of talking about democracy or funding your evil gov to deliver democracy at the end of scud missiles.
Your fragile failing nation is depending on you.
This will only put Umerca more behind in crypto adoption than it already is. It'll become a closed shop like the countries behind the iron curtain during the fake 'cold war'.
Americans AND American'ts will suffer for being held back by the same bankster scum you always allow to lead you around by the nose.

All of your bitcoin wallets are Bitcoin wallets. 
As far as I'm aware, the bitcoin.com wallet is the only bcash wallet. They call if bitcoin cash,  it's ticker being BCH.
Make sure you have a seed for each Bitcoin wallet you have. Assuming you had bitcoin in one of those wallets before the fork, you'll be able to retrieve the BCH by putting the seed from that wallet into the bitcoin.com wallet. 
Make sure you sweep all of the funds in the bitcoin wallet into a new wallet before you make your bitcoin.com wallet. It stores both bitcoin and bcash, so make sure you are starting a BCH bitcoin cash wallet.
When the wallet synchronizes, your BCH turn up at the same amount you had in the bitcoin wallet before you swept the funds.

Thank you. I'll relook the whole thing in context of a sort of academic movement that was looking into these fields, attempts being made to profit of off the knowledge by many interests as a sort of almost academic fad.
I was definitely looking at the whole thing as one actor, where in fact he might just be the most effective or most well known or most funded at the time. In any case the only one I've looked into.

That's what it's called, isn't it?
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:07:51
I'm plenty educated about the issues. I am a bitcoin evangelist. I've gotten hundreds of people started and loaded their wallets, set them up  on an exchange. Currently I am doing 3 or 4 a day.
Believe me when I tell you, to the greater public bcash is referred to as bcash.  These are new users, they are unaware of the debate, or that the debate is over. They are unaware of any 'name calling' etc.  To these new users, I have noticed, for simplicity, they call bcash bcash.
They don't mean to insult anyone, they don't even know it is an insult. They are just using the term because it makes things less confusing.
Now, granted I'm not in Umerca. In the rest of the world where people speak english as a second language, they often simplify or mispronounce things.
Maybe in Umerca bcash is still referred to as bitcoin cash, but in the scope of things that nation is way behind and it doesn't matter what they call it.
For example, most of the world calls mobile phones mobile phones. In Umerca you call it a cell phone. In german speaking countries it is a 'handy'. It really doesn't matter what Umerca thinks, the rest o f us call it bcash.
I have yet to see a newspaper article in the language of my country that even mentions bcash or bitcoin cash. It's all about bitcoin. But to new  users who are just becoming aware of other crypt currencies, bcash is just another one of those, has nothing to do with bitcoin besides naming it, just like bitcoin dark or bitcoin unlimited or bitcoin gold.
The general public calls it bcash.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:20:44
It's just easier to call it bcash.

They don't know what bcash is. The small part of the population who is even aware of the crypto space knows only bitcoin or maybe ethereum.
The whole bcash thing is purely hyped in the insignificant Umercan realm or on reddit.

I remember it was hastily put up when people started calling it bcash BEFORE the fork.  Hilarious really, they even tried to take the bitconnect ticker, which is an actual project AND then put up a fake coin website to point at and say we can't use that bcash name because it's been taken.
The whole thing would be more comic if it wasn't so pathetic.

Do the math. At 10,000X current transactions, by going big block road, you need seriously big blocks that no one will be able to run a node for. 
You would just be creating a clunky centralized confusing version of paypal where one group has total control of the network.

The problem is that they are trying to compete with corporations who process payments in fiat instead of understanding that bitcoin is a currency which, in time, those very same corporations will have to integrate into their system just like they do all other currencies.

Good point
@_date: 2019-06-06 06:07:01
It's happened to a few people I know personally. 
It's usually people who don't speak english as their first language or come from a culture which is not as quick to game people or screw people over as the Umercan (lack of) culture, who get caught in the snare.
I've spent considerable time on skype calls with people all over SE Asia and S Asia, helping them understand. They are usually aghast at why some one would do this.
It definitely makes the whole thing look and feel bad. 
The word spreads to stay away from it.
It just takes time, but there's a reason bcash is such a colossal failure.
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:59:48
It'll be millions of dollars per coin because billionaires want to be able to store their 'wealth'. Most coins are not available, so they'll have to compete with each other for a very small number of coins liquid at any given point. Probably will be just the newly mined coins.
@_date: 2017-11-24 13:53:31
All currencies peg themselves in some way to the US dollar because of the petro-dollar thing where ALL oil trade has to be in US dollars. From there, the individual gov inflates the shit out of their currency - as far as they can in any case. 
Of course the 'currency' they peg to is also getting inflated to oblivion.
Hong Kong dollars are not US dollars, but they are pegged to US dollars and then inflated by Hong Kong banksters, all the while the US dollar they 'pegged' to is being inflated like crazy.
I'm glad people are finally interested in understanding these things.

If it was an actual 'split in the community'.
Most bitcoin holders DON'T come to reddit.
Most bitcoin holders don't even speak english.
There is a tiny fringe group paid to seem like a 'split in the community' backed by banksters who mean to slow down bitcoin adoption and cause confusion in the general public.
It's not working.
The few people who are even aware of this split call bitcoin bitcoin and bcash bcash in order to avoid confusion.
Simple as that.

I had a friend who insisted on having me buy him bcash a few months ago because 'it was cheaper', I tried to explain the difference, that you don't NEED a whole bitcoin, but he was insistent. After that the price went way down. 
Over the weekend, I called him and told him the price movement. He was well in profit at that point. I begged him, i pleaded to sell. But he thought it would go to the moon.
I explained the attack, the pump and dump and basically eventually FUDed him into sending the bch to my exchange wallet. I normally don't behave like that, but was honestly concerned by his position.
I sold, but not  at the top. He still got out ahead and now HODLs bitcoin, which was still sub 6K at the time. He got lucky - many others didn't.
He called me today and thanked me profusely. I told him I suck at investment advise and will never try to influence his buy sell decisions again, but this time I had to, it was just too obvious and I really thought he'd end up getting raped if he didn't listen to me.

Is that a new fork as well? Is there a wallet for it? I can't find any references to it.
How do I claim my forked bitcoin segwit. I've got bitcoin, so any more forks  I can just load into a wallet like i did with the bcash, right?
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:55:32

When you have that much dough, you just want to be able to store it.
It is why art work becomes worth ridiculous money.
When the billionairres jump on (way too late) it'll be because 100 btc will be able to store 100 million dollars. They will need it to retain that value, just like they need art to maintain it's 'value'.
It's good for anyone with more than a million Satoshi right now, assuming you HODL and refuse to sell your bitcoin to billionaires for less than 1 million dollars per bitcoin.
The amount of bitcoin liquid at any one point is very low.
Guys, keep HODLing. Make the bastards scrap and struggle to even find available bitcoin.
Buy every little bit you can, so that THEY will have even less liquid and available to them.
The rich will still be rich big fish, but we will be bigger fish than we are right now being at the bottom of THEIR game.

I know they deserved to fail, but so colossally and so publicly. It hurts to watch.
At the end of the day, even many people lost a lot of money, it is important that this happened so that in future people adopting bitcoin can very clearly see the dangers of a bosscoin like the bcash forks.

They are far too deep in their illusion that over inflated fiat has ANY value at all.
Those of us who value bitcoin from bitcoin, as in 'it's costing me 12,500 Satoshi for a dollar today', are winning. 
The fools that still value things from the point of view of fiat, are constantly losing.
Make the mental switch. One of these is consistent and transparent, the other is the world's biggest ponzi scheme and completely opaque. Doesn't take a rocket scientist to work this one out. Fortunately the bankers are way to stupid to be able to make the switch. Therefore we are witnessing and being part of the greatest transfer of wealth in human history.

This makes the most sense. Millibits and bits sound ridiculous. The sound of the word sucks. Way way too geeky.
Satoshi sounds cool and has sex appeal, sounds like a currency.
Besides, bits and millibits are an americo-centric idea. For the rest of the planet, Satoshi makes much more sense. Have a look at this list:
At 8,100 per bitcoin:
648 Satoshi for a Mexican Peso.
371 Satoshi for a Thai Baht
243 Satoshi for a Philippine Peso
119 Satoshi per Nepalese Rupee 
110 Satoshi for Japanese Yen.
 9.04 Satoshi for a Myanmar Kyat
0.91 Satoshi for an Indonesian Rupiah
0.54 Satoshi for a Vietnamese Dong.
IT TAKES 2 VIET DONG TO BUY A SINGLE SATOSHI !!!!!
These are significant populations who are increasingly technology obsessed and well aware of inflation and banking stealing your savings from you, which are not that far off parity to Satoshi.
Millibits and such still end up being useless to a population far far bigger than the US or Europe. It is only a handful of Countries for whom millitbits may necessary (for wrapping  your head around the number as this thread suggests) as an intermediate step to Satoshi also being at parity with even those government issued currencies.j

Well if you truly do believe in God, what makes you think that funding murder, theft, rape and oppression through your taxes is somehow ok?
It is sinful of the highest order. Completely immoral to give these demons even a single cent of your money.
You WILL be held accountable when your day comes.
I live outside of Umerca - quite far away from that godless place. The name of my country is irrelevant at this point.
The point is, out here people get along.  
We try to see things from other perspectives. Opinions are not so important to us and we never set them in stone because we have chosen some pre determined stance prescribed to us by our overlords. 
We understand that by supporting community the community supports us as well. We are interested in watching our children grow up peacefully and well adjusted without weird bizarre notions of 'winners and losers' and all that other conformist crap that makes all you American'ts so unbelievably insecure.
Even creating a department of homeland insecurity. Insecurity obsessed scared ignorant fools led around by the nose by the ruthless evil people who you deify because they are 'rich.'
We honour diversity and individual expression. We aren't hung up on strange perverted ideas about sexuality. We actually have sex. We see it as a bodily function which keeps people healthy and peaceful, not as a tool to control people, sell stuff and mix up with 'morality'.
We understand that no one has a right to point a finger at someone else taking some moral high ground while they still support murder, theft, rape and oppression on the largest scale ever seen in human history through paying your taxes to your evil empire.
I could go on, but I won't. 
Please understand this comes from a place deep inside of us out here - outside of Umerca - begging you 'people': please stop. Please stop with the killing and violence and theft. The oppression. Please stop supporting the most evil, ruthless and dangerous collection of criminals under the title 'government' ever seen on this planet. Please stop with the finger pointing and clean up your own mess.
Please please please. Try to become human. Humans being.

It only makes sense for people used to pounds, euros and dollars. The rest of the planet is creeping up to satoshi parity AND that is where the most people are.
These are based on last week's prices:
0.7 Satoshi for a Vietnamese Dong.
1.28 Satoshi for an Indonesian Rupiah
 12.3 Satoshi for a Myanmar Kyat
146 Satoshi for Japanese Yen.
160 Satoshi per Nepalese Rupee 
320 Satoshi for a Philippine Peso.  
500 Satoshi for a Thai Baht
873 Satoshi for a Mexican Peso.
At today's price Indo Rupiah is at 1.18 satoshi, so Indonesian Rupiah will be 1:1 soon. That's a population bigger than the US and they are increasingly tech savvy.
Bit-mbits etc. - well, we'll just have to skip them and think of them as ideas that seemed to make sense before we understood the real growth pattern of bitcoin internationally.

This thread is so Umercan in an already americo-centric reddit!!
It seems either you consumers will have to change and use mom pop shops or wait for 'retailers' to start accepting btc. There is no incentive for them to do so. All corporations benefit from the fractional reserve scam.
In the rest of the world however, where corporations are not quite so dominant in people's lives, we see how easy it is for mom pop shops who often can't take third party payments from the legacy system, just have to download an app and write down 24 words.

This is reddit. It is extremely Americo-centric and Umerca is waaay behind in the bitcoin revolution.
It is unlikely that any Iranian Bitcoin users would even know of this sub(or even the existence of reddit) as Bitcoin swept through Iran before any one in Umerca even noticed it.
I am assuming your friend can speak, read and write, so
Your friend would be better off talking to old friends in Iran and finding out the local information there. It may be hard to get people to part with their BTC as Iranian Bitcoin holders are among the most die hard Bitcoin HODLers on the planet.
They bought BTC in order to be part of the silent bloodless revolution which might make it possible for them to live their lives without Umercan bombs raining down upon them. They didn't buy to get rich in fiat.
But that being said, I understand there is a thriving exchange market happening in spite of the US sanctions. It seems one of the ways common people can take part in international commerce.
In short, this is NOT the place to find out ANYTHING about Bitcoin outside of the US, especially Iran.

Bcash is not Bitcoin, but rather a corpcoin, they can do whatever they want, stop being so upset about it. It is designed that way for the owners.
It is just the way it is. 
Relax. Take a ride on a bike or something. It's just one transaction on a corpcoin chain. Get used to it, it'll happen again and again. People are used to this from the current system. They'll have the speed, low fees and convenience offered by centralized corpcoins, they won't care.

Then we study, with that understanding of the tech comes confidence and we no longer really care about the fiat price. We've become HODLERS.
The next step is wait till you are well ahead in fiat terms and start to spend and replace. Offer every transaction to be in bitcoin, set people up with a wallet, then replace spendings. Keep your bitcoin dust increasing.

I'm guessing you've got some creative Roger math behind that.
It's easy to say blocks need to be 200 GB EVERY ten minutes when you are attracting less than 20K per block .... and dropping.
Probably better if you stick to real math and real computer engineers like the open source bossless bitcoin project.

That whole blockstream/AXA story is just part of the Saint Bitts LLC false narrative and completely unfounded.
I'm taking about bcash fake fork corpcoin.
It's that, 'hey look over there, while we take you from behind' trick.
Blockstream is a tiny little company in the space and the whole take over of the 'core' repository line is a joke if you have even the slightest clue of how open source collaborative projects work. It simply is not possible to 'take over' an open source project in a very systemic sense.
If you bought that line, my condolences. Maybe do a bit of research and learn the actual mechanism behind open source development, which would prohibit this bcash corporate narrative from being even marginally true.
Bcash is of course a corpcoin, where everything is directed top down, like the EDA, the regular forks, the 'rescue hash power' during the hash war between the corporate bosses, the checkpoints, the recent roll back, the bug in the fork insta fix etc. 
None of those things would even be possible in an open source project.
Bitcoin and LN are open source collaborations. They seem messy , clunky , and broken until suddenly they work. Like Bitcoin back in 2013 before SPV wallets, where you had to have the entire blockchain just to be able you spend and receive. It all develops before our very eyes.
Bcash exists because a handful of greedy corporate types recognized a group of consumer mindset bitcoin users that wanted more security, things to work by a dead line, SOMEONE IN CHARGE. They fulfilled that need for those users and immediately screwed them over - as corporate types do. Thus 97% down - 3% away from NADA -zero.
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:39:59
I still got both, but I am in no illusion on which one will 'win'.  Maybe the one with the smart devs? You know the ones that can do math.
When bcash is having to run 256gigabyte blocks it'll be pretty clear who 'the winner' is.

He's an insecure lost little billionaire criminal. I'd be surprised if his brain could ever make the switch from viewing bitcoin as an investment to what it is - a silent bloodless revolution to marginalize scum like him. 
The media portrayed taksin as a saviour of the people because he was working for Rockefellar to undermine thai sovereignty. He failed.
There's a reason thailand has never been colonized. This current corporate bankster attempt is slowly failing as well.
No one supported taksin (excluding western corporations). When the handouts dried up all the 'supporters' went home.

0.001 % of the population controls 99% of the dollar wealth. All of the fortune 500 companies are controlled by the same 300 inbred families. 
The dollar wealth distribution is far far out of wack compared to bitcoin.
In bitcoin there ate anonymous billionaires (in dollar value), that would never have been allowed to join the club.
I know of one underprivileged, handicapped man from a third world (not developing, but third world) country who is a billionaire in dollar terms because he has a few thousand bitcoins. He would NEVER have been allowed to be part of the fiat money game. NEVER!!
The club - the fiat dollar printing club - is a closed shop and always has been.
Have you seen money as debt - it is a cartoon. Watch it, it starts to touch on this. Read the creature from jekyl island.
There is a lot of info out there. Did you miss something during the recent occupy wall st protests? I'm pretty sure this is why it was happening in the first place.
Bitcoin is changing the world for precisely this reason. Normal people globally, not just WASPs and zionists on wall st are able to take part. It is permission-less.
The main point is that the CREATION of the wealth is nota secret closed shop. It is transparent and anyone can take part.
The rich will still be rich, but the rest of us won't be so poor.
The gap will close significantly and Umerca will mo longer be 'the richest nation on earth'. THIS is a good thing.

Gov in the open and transparent?
Miners just chase the most profitable place to point their miners. They don't control anything. Central banking literally controls everything.
There's a huge difference. And seeing that bitcoin has chosen the secure, censorship resistant, decentralized path, the mining thing will even out. 
We do have a concentration of power in the network, but not TOO MUCH. This will get better over time.
The bcash fork is worrying because said concentrated power IS THE TOTAL hashing power of bcash. That chain IS run by miners who will do whatever they like.

I think we'll find that it becomes profitable ONLY if you are using renewable energy as that industry can accept bitcoin as payment directly from the miners without interfacing with fiat.
Natural energy - be it solar, wind, thermal, zero point, whatever - directly to bitcoin which goes directly to the natural energy provider.
Legacy energy systems require payment in fiat, so miners using fossil fuels will have to haggle on the exchanges for fiat to make their energy payments.
For the miners, which method of payment is more frictionless, secure and functional? Maybe they make a deal with the geothermal plant to pay a small percentage of the actual rewards the mining farm receives.
Maybe the staff at the geothermal facility get paid in bitcoin as their preference. That makes it even easier.
Bitcoin will be dribbling into the economy partly through the growth of the new energy systems and the people who build develop and man them. They'll all be happy to be paid in bitcoin. Sure beats buying it. They then exchange to fiat as needed. The miners won't need to. Only trading for the fiat that they might need.
One of these currencies is increasing in value and one is constantly being inflated. Hmmm..... Doesn't take a rocket scientist.
Money badger don't care about and isn 't attached to the legacy system. Just does what the honey badger does.

BU with their buggy closed source client? All eyes were on it.
It was the big corporate take over attempt. Thank God they failed.
The UASF was the first time in corporate history that the users, the little guy, stopped the corporations in their tracks. It was when I decided to finally take an old laptop I had laying around and run a node.
Being part of it was thrilling. Beating the corporate interests seemed a pipe dream - it had never been done before in all of human history, but we did it.
That was the day Bitcoin grew up, it was the day millions of people on the sidelines, who simply didn't believe Bitcoin was anti-fragile to human greed and corporate shenanigans, saw with their own eyes that the promise was real and jumped aboard.
The following run up and bubble were no big surprise to anyone who was really watching.
But I digress.
The fact is that there were very few real people who actually believed the false corporate narratives.
Just a gullible few who never really understood the IDEA of open source collaborative development and were still stuck in the old hierarchical top down mindset that has ruled human institutions since forever.  
Because of their consumer oriented mindest, They simply thought they should get what THEY WERE PROMISED by SOMEONE UP THERE, DAMN IT !!!
These people unfortunately, because they simply could not  make that switch in consciousness simply believed that 'debate' and directives from above were how Bitcoin functioned. Big mistake. It cost them considerably.
They were very much in the minority, but would not shut up with their incessant repeating. It really was irritating.
The rest of us were like, "well then run the corporate binary client, if you like it so much, but please, enough with the repeating of corporate slogans."
We could do math, we used our calculators, we looked at our personal experiences running full nodes and we made our personal decisions AND RAN THE CLIENT we thought moved in the right direction. We voted by Nakamoto Consensus.
The fake AWS nodes spun up over night running the BU binaries were a worry, but proved irrelevant in the scheme of things.
Bitcoin was OURS, not THEIRS.
Everything since, even the corpcoin fork, hijacking of rbtc,  twitter, the bitcoin.Con etc. have been irrelevant sideshows in comparison, The war had been won.

Blockstream is just another corporation trying to become known in the bitcoin space. They have virtually no influence over core project. Yes, there's a few known bitcoin developers picking up a salary for working ON BLOCKSTREAM projects, but what about the rest of core? What about the open source peer reviewed system?
Do you really think that the peers in core who actually do the reviewing and testing will sellout just because some other devs work for a corporation that is owned by a bank?
I think it would be wise of you to learn the difference.
The bcoin project is centralized, backed by JP Morgan and is a tight ship. No one moves without permission.
There are zero independent devs. It is NOT an open source peer reviewed project.
Don't let the borgstream FUD fool you. Those cats at bcoin are sellouts in a big way. Quite possibly the dark bankster forces have something on each of the players and now those players must do the bidding of THEIR masters.

Only Americans view 1 dollar as one dollar. For the rest of us it is a much bigger number than that and often orders of  magnitude off of parity with the US dollar.
Have a look at this list:
(Valued At 8,100 dollars per bitcoin)
12,346 Satoshi for a US dollar
1,859 Satoshi for a Chinese Yuan
648 Satoshi for a Mexican Peso.
371 Satoshi for a Thai Baht
243 Satoshi for a Philippine Peso
119 Satoshi per Nepalese Rupee 
110 Satoshi for Japanese Yen.
 9.04 Satoshi for a Myanmar Kyat
0.91 Satoshi for an Indonesian Rupiah
0.54 Satoshi for a Vietnamese Dong.
IT TAKES 2 VIET DONG TO BUY A SINGLE SATOSHI !!!!!
I'm not bothering to calculate Zimbabwe.
There are some significant populations who are increasingly technology obsessed and well aware of inflation and banking stealing your savings from you, which are on parity with Satoshi or approaching it. In fact the population dwarfs that of the US and Europe.
Millibits and such still end up being useless to a population far far bigger than the US or Europe. It is only a handful of Countries for whom millitbits may necessary (for wrapping  your head around the number as this thread suggests) as an intermediate step to Satoshi also being at parity with even those government issued currencies.
Not to mention Satoshi has a ring to it. It sounds like a currency. It is intrinsically cool. You'll never get cool factor with bits and millibits.

It makes no sense to use any of those confusing denominations when most of the world is moving towards parity with Satoshi.
This list was calculated months ago, so is already out of date. For example the Indonesian Rupiah is also already at 1:1 with Satoshi:
0.7 Satoshi for a Vietnamese Dong.
1.28 Satoshi for an Indonesian Rupiah
 12.3 Satoshi for a Myanmar Kyat
146 Satoshi for Japanese Yen.
160 Satoshi per Nepalese Rupee 
320 Satoshi for a Philippine Peso.  
500 Satoshi for a Thai Baht
873 Satoshi for a Mexican Peso.
These are significant populations who are increasingly technology obsessed and well aware of inflation and banking stealing your savings from you, which are not that far off parity to Satoshi.
Millibits and such still end up being useless to a population far far bigger than the US or Europe combined. It is only a handful of Countries for whom millitbits may necessary (for wrapping  your head around the number as this thread suggests) as an intermediate step to Satoshi also being at parity with even those government issued currencies.

The speed on bcash and on bitcoin are the same.
If it is a real worry to you, HODL in bitcoin because it is a secure decentralized network and transact on litecoin for smaller transactions
Unless all these posts are shill posts, timed to come out same time as spam attacks, it just doesn't make sense that I would be the only guy who gets low or no fees through in the next block every time.

The problem is that most people don't recognize the outright fraud in corporate policies, even when it is right in front of their face.

They are by and large unaware of anything that is going on, they don't understand bitcoin, they invested, they are getting a massive return. They point their hash power to a pool and are oblivious to which chain etc. the pool is mining on. they want their dividend - in Yuan.

A dollar is a dollar .....  To most of us.
Therein lies the problem, in that for a few of us (or rather THEM - about 8,000 people worldwide), a dollar is not a medium of exchange, something that has to be worked for or exchanged for value. But rather, something that can be created out of thin air with a few strokes on a keyboard connected to the right permissioned computer system, in order to pay fake people to deliver fake news, fake wars, oppression, economic slavery and mass surveillance.
I'll leave the rest of your questions for other posters.

It is definitely an intentional deception trying to trick people. That you would argue it is just bizarre.
If they weren't intentionally trying to create confusion for noobs, they'd just list bitcoin cash and what they believe to be the pros of it and Bitcoin, without any default to either.
Bitcoin.com being the only place on the www that calls bitcoin 'bitcoin core', is intentionally deceptive.
This is evident to anyone not biased to the deceit.

Syria has a thriving Bitcoin market, albeit much smaller than Western Union. 
WU is still such a big (but not huge,) thing is because it is a corporation with a budget for sales and marketing.

You might be one of those confused bcashers that needs SOMEONE IN CHARGE making decisions for you directed too down from your corporate leaders to your solo developer.
Bitcoin on the other hand is an open source collaborative effort, there is no dev team. 
Bcash corp coin has a dev team (but pretty much run by one guy) with a 'road map', that simply wouldn't be possible on Bitcoin.
I recommend learning something about how open source development works.

And now back to 1 sat 
This fee obsession is hilarious.
@_date: 2019-04-06 04:43:09
The 50 posters on rbtc have convinced themselves that all that needs to happen for the market to choose bcash is for fees on BTC to go up. They are able to post 24 hours a day somehow and dominate every thread with their deceptions.
They don't seem to understand Bitcoin, blockchain, open source development, economics, decentralization, permissionlessness or the importance of securing the network.
The few users they have all use SPV wallets being verified by 3 supernodes, the mining is one organization and all development decisions are directed top down from their corporate leaders.
That they believe people will jump ship from Bitcoin to bcash based on fees alone, when their network is in such a sorry state is ludicrous.
I think they are paid to keep the false narratives populating all discussion.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:38:33
Hang around. You'll understand the tech in time and your fear of using it will go away.
I remember for a long time people would send an email twice just in case it 'didn't go through' before they realized it always does 'go through'.
By using it to transact, in time, your brain will just accept that it always goes through. Same thing. Keep on using.

It's more likely that the large holders of bcash need to liquidate and pumping it during the overall lift of the bitcoin tide.

Mate, the last time we had this many transactions, fees were already skyrocketing.
They'll go up some for some, but it won't be like last time.
I for one have personally taken almost 200 transactions per month off of the blockchain by using LN over the past 3. Months. I imagine many other people who transact often have done the same.
The privacy feels great, the transaction is instant and i love that the small (under $40) transactions don't show up on the blockchain.
Also, the corporations behind segwit X2 takeover attempt and bcash fork are not as liquid as they were last time, so their spam may not be as effective this time around.

It is BCH as far as everyone else is concerned and no it is not better or efficient than bitcoin.
If bch had even the smallest amount of real world use, it would be just as 'inefficient' as bitcoin. Don't let the FUD masters who can't do math fool you.
I personally got out at 2600, even that was risky to wait for the pump to get that high. I'll rebuy when it's back at it's real price around 250.
It's worth holding onto, but not at these prices. This coin has zero real world utility.
@_date: 2019-04-03 02:14:59
Give it some time.
Both Bitcoin and Lightning are collaborative, voluntary, open source protocols. They develop before our very eyes.
It is what makes Bitcoin special. It is leaderless.
The amount of work and creativity being put into both projects is phenomenal.
For many people, all of us being used to a world where the decisions are administered top down, both BTC and LN dev can look messy from the outside. But it is simply how open source collaborations work.
Bcash is a great example of a very small community of people who simply couldn't accept bossless development and need SOMEONE UP THERE IN CHARGE with a ROAD MAP. It is bitcoin, but centralized in a corporate devision making process, administered top down.
There is nothing exciting or different about the bcash business model, it's the same corporate model that we are all used to. It is just a silly thing to do in the crypto space where the vast majority of people are attracted by this new idea of leaderless money. 
BTC grows because it is the world's ONLY bossless medium of exchange in history. It develops and changes by consensus, there is no one in charge.
Just spend your time educating yourself and possibly joining the collaborative efforts in any way you can.
Lightning is not perfect yet, but it works, it is growing and development is astounding. Have a go, but understand that it is still experimental and evolving by the day. With open source development, we the users are part of the evolution, it is not dictated from the corporate heads down to the dev dept who is required to stick to a corporate agreed upon road map.

All your narrative, although well thought out corporate catch phrases, are disengenuous and false.
Bitcoin is for people who understand the concept of permissionless, leaderless money, a network driven by consensus.
Bcash is for people who need to HAVE SOMEONE IN CHARGE with a ROAD MAP. 
As bcash is a corp coin administered from the top down, where the leaders firmly believe that through the old corporate models of appearing to give the people what they want NOW, and heaps of PR, advertising and censorship , that the public will chose the corporate top down alternative to open source permissionless collaboration.
So far they've been wrong.
The action is on the open source leaderless chain, BTC. Crypto is evolving, Bitcoin is simply leading the way (again), in boldly developing on 2nd layer. The rest of the coins will follow, that's just what they do.

I've been using eclair wallet most of the time recently, but have been toying with blue wallet now for a week or 2.
On eclair, I have it pointed at my grand daughter's LN node as she set it up for me and my SPV wallets have been using her BTC node for verification for years, but on blue wallet, i am running it using their custodial solution.
I would recommend blue wallet to get started as it is quite simple to understand and from there start to dig into becoming part of the network, possibly setting up your own node.
Hope it helps.
@_date: 2019-04-18 02:22:17
You seem to have been led to believe some untruths, false narratives and straight out lies. These corporate narratives are designed to confuse people about the open source developed, decentralized, permissionless and leaderless Lightning network.
The corporations behind the deceptions stand to lose significantly from the relentless growth, adoption and development coming out of the open source collaborative efforts of BTC and LN development. In short, they are terrified. Their legacy top down directed systems cannot compete with thousands of volunteers collaborating in open source protocol development of BTC/LN.
Be aware of this. Stay away from rbtc. It is an irrelevant, desperate corner of the internet, where the same 50 odd users dominate every single thread repeating the same corporate lies and false narratives back and forth to each other 24 hours a day. You won't get anything of value there, it is for entertainment purposes only.
To address your 'concerns', NO, it is impossible to fractionally reserve bitcoin on the lightning network. IMPOSSIBLE. As in NOT possible.
Do some study on how bitcoin technology actually works. Then you may be able to comprehend how lightning works.
The example you show, where you get custody of someone's bitcoin on a web site, would be far easier to do with on chain transactions. And indeed it is being done today by all the exchanges, Because they have TOTAL control of the bitcoin the users sent them.
If those exchanges try to do the same thing with bitcoin under time locked contract (a lightning transaction), the user simply has to close the channel and get their funds back.
@_date: 2019-04-19 05:08:57

These users seem to be able to post on every 'discussion' on every post 24 hours a day. They dominate each thread with their deceit, but there's very few of them.
I saw post by u/vigilante that actually listed the user names, and got banned from rbtc for it.
It's a strange silly corner of the internet and quite irrelevant.

The point is leaderlessness. No figure head. No smiling face in a suit. 
This makes Bitcoin appealing because no one has to decide if they like or trust the face of the project - there is none.
Also, What gives me faith in humanity is watching all these bosscoins with their marketing departments, development budgets and deals with corporations etc trying really hard with dismal results in comparison to the open source leaderless bitcoin.
I am very interested in Ethereum. It is simply a great idea. Other projects like siacoin and powerledger have also gotten my attention. However, without the leaderless one out there keeping the whole shebang going, I would be very wary of any alt coin's prospects in the real world. This tech would be far too powerful if abused by the current scumy powers that be, who have zero hesitation to surveil and control us all.

Are you seriously repeating that tired old corporate false narrative. 
Dude, stop living in the past. This is 2019, not 2016.
There were NEVER $60 fees. There was the odd $40 fee that PEOPLE CHOSE TO PAY. During those corporate fuelled spam attacks, I never paid more than a dollar and only had 3 transactions out of hundreds stuck in the mem pool.
Your misunderstanding of reality is palpable.
I recommend actually using BTC for transactions, like I do, instead of just repeating false corporate narratives that are making you poor.
You'll learn something and you'll have your own experience to base your judgement on.
You'll find the base layer works just fine. BUT use segwit addresses and LEARN TO SET YOUR OWN FEES AND AVOID THE  LAME BITCOINDOTCON WALLET.

Guys, just for entertainment, you gotta go read the comments. 
These posters are so unbelievably led around by the nose by their corporate false narratives. The desperation to have LN viewed as something that it is not, is palpable.
Of course it is the same user names you see on every thread in rbtc sub, desperately commenting the same lies back and forth to each other in the hope that it will be true if they just repeat it enough. 
What I find truly bizarre is that while the bcash users are more than happy being led around by the whims of their corporate overlords, completely centralized mining, top down corporate decision making, corporate directed development road maps, no non mining full nodes, and everyone using SPV wallets being 'verified' by supernodes all belonging to bcash corp, they point their fingers at BTC/LN and scream 'hub and spoke', 'fractional reserve' and all the rest of it. rbtc = lies and censorship.

Let me know when you've written the code. I'll run a node on it and see how we go.
Bitcoin is an open source collaborative project and not administered from the top down as corp coin like ripple or bcash, 
In Bitcoin development, There's no one in charge to appeal to, there is no road map, in the corporate sense. Things aren't debated and then dictated from the leaders, because there are no leaders, it's just people choosing which client to run. And anyone (with the right chops) can write a client and propose it.
Write it, post it and see if we get a good response from miners and node operators choosing to run it of their own free will based on their own calculations and understanding of bitcoin.

It seems you are viewing the future from the paradigm we are in today.
It is true that the economic expansion and quality of life improvements that we have seen in the last hundred years could not have happened in the way that it did without fractional reserve system.
But did it HAVE TO happen that way.
It is possible that we are now ready to enter an era where we as human beings do things differently. 
Maybe more economically. 
Is it possible that the wasteful corporate model will also become obsolete? Is it possible that the status quo's resisting new technology, energy and processes will also have to go by the way by?
Planned obsolescence, fossil fuel dependency and  outright plundering of the planet is no longer necessary and NEEDS to stop.
I think it is more a case of trying to imagine the possibilities of better systems that will have to emerge as the debt based corporate plunder model gets replaced.
It is very possible that Bitcoin will not only be a part of this transition, but may well drive it.

Not sure how much more vulnerable they can get. 
Right now bcash mining is completely centralized, the development is basically one guy carrying out corporate directives, most BCH held by a few people, 3% of the world's available hash power and the few users they have all using SPV wallets with 3 supernodes verifying transactions for them.
It's a very sorry state of affairs.
@_date: 2019-04-09 01:16:46
I think it is quite simple. 
Those that didn't understand consensus and needed SOMEONE IN CHARGE to run a debate and then direct the results of the 'debate' from top down, gravitated towards the corpcoin model of bcash as soon as the corporations offered it to the 'consumers'. They view crypto as a product.
They simply never understood how open source development works. The narrative of blockstream somehow having control of 'core' with all those independent contributors with their eyes on the project is ludicrous to those that understand the  systemic nature of open source collaboration. It is simply not possible.
It is ironic that they are seemingly supportive of a top down corporate directed ROAD MAP oriented approach to centralized corporate protocol development. But it makes sense when you realize they never got consensus in the first place.
@_date: 2019-12-06 07:55:38

After reading through the rbtc sub for a mere half hour, You'll notice that almost all of the comments in every single thread are from the same user names.
A while ago, u/truthvigilante listed the top 30 full time posters, who appear to be able to post 24 hours a day. I recognized every single user name.
It seems the tactic is to dominate all 'discussions' with the same tired corporate narratives repeating the same false narratives over and over again.
It would be funny if it weren't so sad and desperate. Surely they don't think that by repeating deceptive garbage to each other all day long in an irrelevant corner of the internet has any positive effect on bcash adoption. Just about everywhere else on the internet, it is made quite clear that bcash is scammy and disingenuous. 
By carrying on in this way just makes them look like the corporate led fools they are.

I've got a big pile of friends who were tricked, it wasn't the 'bitcoin cash' that fooled them, but rather the 'bitcoin core'.
Because they'd heard the term bitcoin cash and it sounded familiar, they bought it, whereas, 'bitcoin core', being cited only on bitcoin.com, was not familiar, they shied away from it.
Now most of them are 90% down on their value and have become very bitter about the whole 'Bitcoin thing'.
It is highly deceptive, does harm and doesn't really create any goodwill amongst the new reluctant bcash holders.

Hey hey, The Classic corporate narrative fed to brain dead bcash fools who simply can't fit the idea of consensus into their heads. 
They actually believe this.
The corporate leaders at bcash corp coin are laughing their heads off that the users are willing to forfeit control of what is an intrinsically decentralized system, where users have a say, to them, the very corporations that benefit from total control of bcash.
It'd be funny if it weren't so sad. 
It's almost like the bcash fork was simply the brain dead being separated out from the rest of BTC users.
The cry babies who couldn't get consensus for their experiment, because everyone else using basic math worked out that TB blocks are a stupid idea, needed SOMEONE IN CHARGE with a ROAD MAP to be BEHOLDEN TO. Someone calling the shots - I guess it made them feel more secure in this wild free market space.
That group never understood how open source development or consensus works, but instead of informing themselves, they just gravitated to the first corporate cabal that appeared to offer them the security of top down management that they so crave.

It's the main 'philosophical' difference between Bitcoin and bcash.
Bitcoin is open source collaboration, which in a systemic sense makes it impossible for any one person or group to exercise control over the protocol. As previous commenter mentioned, this makes it very difficult to make changes that aren't self-evident GREAT ideas. 
Bcash was created by the corporate interests behind the attempted corporate takeover of bitcoin through the segwit X2 debacle (NY and HK 'agreements'), by appealing to the very small group of bitcoiners that either didn't understand open source development or didn't like the leaderless nature of it. In short to appeal to the users who view crypto as a product, feel more comfortable with top down directives to lead development, having a road map and SOMEONE IN CHARGE.
Again, like in many other industries, the open source development, decentralized method is proving to be more effective than the old top down method, resulting in a very spectacular and very public failure of bcash when the corporate bosses had a falling out, leaving the user base in a position where they had to choose their respective boss for their respective corp coin.

Yes, all your points are about bcash. The hash rate on BTC only went down by a few percent during the fork.
Although bcash is seriously centralized (as was shown by the very existence of a hash war between 2 parties) now with 2 competing centralized chains, Bitcoin has no where near that amount of power concentrated in one place.
Bcash is a boss coin.

It is all just simpler for me this way and it has made my meager retirement income more dignified over time. Because I spend and replace, trying to have a few satoshi extra from time to time, my base BTC amount is usually the same and slightly increasing.

It's kind of like stashing a gold coin somewhere hard to find when your coach gets stopped by bandits as you are passing through the dark woods. In fact, it is exactly like that.

My only other comment: the media is talking about the coming war.
They always do that. It is becoming a more and more difficult thing to sell to a democratic country. The problem is when a country just goes ahead and pre-emptively attacks another WITHOUT the people's approval. And this particular danger is becoming more and more real.
So, yes, let's debase the power these lunatics have to print money out of thin air to wage endless fake wars without the people's approval.
We need to change this lame bankster narrative that bitcoin is some kind of 'investment' that gets bought, sold and priced in dollars back to the original Message that bitcoin is the currency of the people which removes the power if the banksters to carry on their silly agenda through their control of governments and their militaries.
Thanks for the vigilance. Every one of us who gets it counts.

Bizarre article backhandedly shilling bitcoin and regulation.
The reason people world over and governments will ultimately see Bitcoin as THE only real choice is that bitcoin is bossless. Period.
That is not to say that boss coins will not flourish and be widely used, but they will be 'trusted' and kept in line by the people ONLY because All boss coins, and fiat for that matter, will be valued in Satoshi.
It is the mere existence of the world's first bossless currency, that makes the whole shebang interesting in the first place.

You sound like the type of guy who is so confused, he'd compare an apple with a bulldozer.
Blockbuster is a company, it was in the vdo business, netflix is a company in the vdo business. They are comparable, the are companies, of the same nature, just differing 'business models'.
Blockbuster is a company (the apple)
Bitcoin is a protocol, like   Think bitcoin:// (the bulldozer)
In your analogy bitcoin is the vdo, not the company or delivery system.
All implementations of a blockchain crypto currency post bitcoin are analogous to being just other versions of   That have a boss, otherwise known as boss coins.
As big as microsoft or apple are, and as capable as they would be of writing a protocol superior to http:// , no one would ever be interested because http:// is a bossless protocol and the corporate version would be a boss protocol.
Think global. People out there - outside of Umerca are tired of generations of western oppression - the boss.
There is no way you can convince them that the new boss will be better than the  old boss, there is no marketing powerful enough to achieve that, even if the corporate version is 'superior'.
They are interested in bitcoin because it is bossless.
An aside, all the boss coins are tolerated simply by the mere existence of the bossless one. Without the bossless one, out there in the wild, with no centralized point of attack, control or failure, keeping the whole IDEA of crypto going, these centralized boss coins would be taken out quicker than you can say: bcash is a boss coin.

Coming from your narrow perspective, I can see why you would repeat that narrative you've been trained to repeat.
Putting words in my mouth however, based on your blind assumptions, is revealing your ignorance.
As for the logic., let me make it more simple for you:
It is very simple. If you had a background where your parents, grand parents etc. had systematically been screwed over countless times by big, foreign, good looking entities and one day a way of trading comes along based on a digital currency which is bossless, why on earth would you choose to trust a big foreign entity's boss coin, no matter how good looking they appeared?
If you have NO choice but to use a boss currency, like fiat, or ANY of the boss coins, in the absence of Bitcoin, then of course, you'd use it.
But the mere possibility of using a form of value transfer that has no boss, for those that have a memory of persecution and oppression by large foreign powers, makes ALL other forms of value transfer second rate.
I didn't make the rules my friend, nor did I decide to oppress and steal from most of the world's population for centuries on end, but these factors have created massive distrust in systems that have a boss (especially a foreign entity), no matter how good the boss looks.
And most of the world's population has been oppressed and carnaged by big, foreign, western entities.

The flaw in your perception is that bitcoin is a product.
Bitcoin is a currency which can be used to pay people to build and design products, sell products and services and buy products and services.
This is why the vast majority of bitcoin are HODLed until a time when they can be directly spent on these things instead of interfacing into fiat, which is fraudulently created by a select privileged few.

It is already becoming viral way too fast, and that is the fault of banks and governments devaluing currencies in a mad race to the bottom.
If anything, we need to slow it down. This narrative of bitcoin (and as an extension alt coins) being some kind of digital asset 'investment' to be valued in fiat terms, as destructive as it is, is actually probably helping it all slow down, which is good.
We are not ready for 'mainstream adoption' as the 'mainstream' is rotten to the core and destroying all living things. 
But the 'mainstream' is sick and dying. Mega corporations are not good for anyone, rampant consumerism - ditto. The bigger this illusion we are wrapped up in becomes, the less real happiness you will find. It is all fake. We have all been duped into a destructive world view.
The American dream was about freedom and sovereignty, yet all the AmeriCAN'Ts in Umerca think it is about the freedom to buy stuff. It really is a crying shame.
Let the big boys perish, life on earth depends upon it.
Let the real AmeriCANs left out there, rise up and claim their birthright of sovereignty and fulfill their DUTY to replace the government that no longer serves them.
Stop waiting for mainstream scum to somehow 'adopt' bitcoin. Let them go the way of the dinosaurs. Bitcoin is for us - real people worldwide who have had enough of being played against each other by the corrupt powers that be and create a world which respects the rights of future generations of all living things - for us to REMEMBER how to get along, to trade, to communicate, to re-create.

I'm not a trader.  The decentralized exchange concept, is exciting, but goes over my head somewhat. I'm still trying to wrap my head around it.
My grand daughter buys bitcoin for me with my meager retirement income, from which, i save in BTC, pay my rent, my private carer, my green fees, and my meals. I lead a simple life and have few other expenses which I do with cash. 
So I am not really concerned with exchanges, other than following the developments (asa spectator) in how it is fairly obvious that the powers that be are choking fiat/BTC exchange, as well as the fraudulent and silly KYC/AML silliness around the whole affair. 
Initially my grand daughter interested me in BTC for the utility that it offered someone my age to simplify my life by cutting out banks and other liars, but having time on my hands to learn about this silent revolution, i find it has given me hope that my progeny have a chance to kick the man's ass finally!!! I have become fascinated with the whole thing and excited about the possibility of a world, which I may never see, where true freedom can be possible, in particular, freedom to create without getting in line and asking for permission at every turn.

It is actually not that complicated at all. It is a new paradigm, so can feel tricky fitting it into your brain.
It is however complicated when fiat is involved, when 'buying' bitcoin with fiat money. That is a reflection of how complicated the permissioned fiat legacy financial system is.
If you were to get paid in Bitcoin in exchange for your time, product or service, it would be very easy. Just select receive on your wallet, provide the address to the payer and done.
Can't get easier.
I recommend at your age, to find ways to earn it. Mow some lawns, clean some pools. Demand payment in Bitcoin, let them work out how to 'buy' it.

I believe it is called strawmannirg, but I might be mistaken.
What I did say is that people  outside of Umerca will never choose a boss coin as the final value layer over the only bossless coin, Bitcoin.
It is you that is delusionaly referring to an imaginary future event where the whole world simply forgets generations of oppression and fraud wrought by western (foreign) powers and as a result, on mass, selects a boss coin to be the world's reserve currency when they clearly, for the first time in history, have the opportunity to trade using a bossless currency.

It is an attack vector and has been debated over the years. 
On one side you have banksters who can create any amount of fiat out of thin air, owning exchanges either directly or through banking relationship then 'trading' that easy (for them) fiat for bitcoin. But There's very few bitcoin available for fiat purchase and that pisses them off, so the bots do their thing. 
It'll backfire on them.
At some point the tiny volume of bitcoin traded every 24 hours (on major exchanges) being washed through like this, which is what seems to determine it's price, will be gobbled up by HODLers. Liquidity of bitcoin will decrease because only the freshly mined coins will be available for fiat purchase. Miners will be prepared to sell at a certain price or higher and Bitcoin will again become a higher fiat value.
The money badger don't care. Value it high in fiat, value it lower in fiat. It don't care, just keeps choofing on.

Relax, that narrative doesn't work here. Before you go off at the mouth, check my reddit history and you'll see I've been around since long before you got into bitcoin thinking you'd get rich.
This is not an assumption. It is observation at how people internationally have been screwed over many times by Umercan corporations. They've smartened up.
The SE Asian 'economic crisis' for example, was caused by one man - Soros. The SE Asian population dwarfs Umerca and they are educated and tech savvy way beyond their Umercan dumbed down counter parts. They remember 1997.
They have also not been programmed to deify privileged super rich people, they have a natural distrust of them, based on experience and generational memory of getting screwed over EVERY single time.
They will NOT be fooled again.
They love bitcoin, not because they might buy a lambo, but because there is no boss.

It's just the latest lame stream bankster narrative trying to get HODLers to sell.
THEY don't realize HODLers will NEVER sell at ANY price. $1 or one million $, NEVER sell back to fiat.
THEY are pissed off by this. 'The price' is decided only by the very small percentage of coins in active trade.
The VAST majority are HODLed by real people for real people and the banksters will never get their grubby fingers on them via 'exchanges'.

It really would make sense, if you are in fact open to understanding this, to look for information on 51% attack and how that relates to bitcoin, not alt coins or some nebulous POW intellectual back and forth.  Bitcoin is a huge network, the sheer computing power dwarfing ALL others, it really would be ridiculous to look into 51% attack referencing anything else.
Also, as you go through the material, keep in mind that a mining pool is just that, a pool. Miners can be configured to switch back and forth between pools at will. In no way does a 'pool' represent some sort of cohesive consortium. When you point your miners at a pool, you don't know who the other miners are. There is no communication between miners in pools. They are not ideologically or economically bound beyond choosing a pool that seems most profitable to the individual miner's choice.
The misconception that a pool having X amount of hashing power being any significant metric at all, as if they were an organization, is ludicrous.
That being said, there are adversaries out there that have unlimited fiat funds, because they are the privileged few who create it out of thin air, who could theoretically 'afford' to pull off a 51% attack, but it would be almost impossible to do this nefariously in secret as the manufacture of that amount of equipment would be very obvious.
The danger of these fools attempting this still exists and no doubt it is on their table of options, if not already in active process. Things will get interesting on the front lines of this war if they move in that direction as they have their enemies too, especially within their own ranks.
All in all, they are too late and I think the chances of meaningful success is very low, with invested miners having too much to lose going head to head with them in a kind of final showdown, before they scurry away with their tails between their legs.

Satoshi disappeared because he developed something real that undermines the power structure of all these goon overlords, call it NSA,CIA,NWO, whatever. He saw what happens to even the liberty dollar - unlawfully raided and stolen from and jailed.

Millennials by and large (but thankfully not ALL) think that because they know where to click on a smart phone or facebook, they are computer savvy. Or because they can put a string of text into a gooooogle search bar they are 'researching'. Some even think hiphop is an art form and that talentless scum link beyonce and kanye are artists (like da vinci).
The dumbing down has been successful.
On the other hand, the tiny percentage who ARE awake are stunning and changing the world positively and dramatically.
All this being said, the official old fart narrative says "they think they are entitled." 
Well, this old fart says "and so they should be. They should be entitled to clean air and water, to opportunities who's barriers of entry are artificially in place because of corporate interests, to education, health etc.  But most of all they are entitled to say no to the bullshit that was here before they arrived and reinvent a better world - even if it leaves all us old fools shocked and lost and the institutions we deify in crumbling dust.

@_date: 2018-11-15 05:28:23
Just to fill you in. There are only about 700,000 bitcoins going around in circles with 'traders'. The vast majority of bitcoin are HODLed by people who are in this for the long game - the silent revolution, where your $1000, that you can afford to lose, is representing a possible future without endless fake wars, mass surveillance and oppression of innovation and creative expression. It makes you sleep well at night that you are part of it. The 'market price' is meaningless.
The 'price' changes by percentage and as other commenters have correctly explained to you, represents only the change in the fiat dollar 'price' that traders are willing to either buy or sell bitcoin at, because 'traders' incorrectly view bitcoin as some kind of 'digital asset' which gets bought/sold/valued in fiat dollar terms, instead of correctly understanding that it is the silent revolutionary potential currency of the people of the future. - i know, horrible sentence, but i think you get what i mean ;)
Also, if you are interested, look into the impending hash wars that will begin today on bcash (BCH). You have a front row seat on the evolution of this new form of money of the people. 
Basically the greedy corporations invested in bitcoin who, as corporations do, are hell bent on total control of bitcoin, forked bitcoin last year to create bitcoin cash, commonly referred to as bcash. They did this because the people, the users, rejected their takeover attempt with a closed technology called segwit X2. They were exciting times. For the first time in history, people beat corporations at their top down game.
That same crowd of greedy invested interests are now battling it out with these hash wars, trying to take each other down, still hell bent on total control.
It WILL affect the 'price' of bitcoin because the miners will swap back and forth between the bcash hash wars and bitcoin constantly balancing between either using their hashing power in the wars by mining at a loss or maximizing profit by mining bitcoin. They will be walking a tight rope. In the big picture it will show the resilience of the bitcoin bossless consensus mechanism at work, where the greedy people HAVE to work within the mathematical framework it is designed by.
However, very few 'traders' understand this and will possibly panic sell, causing the fiat price to drop. Then people who do understand this will buy to HODL, causing the price to rise, which will cause traders to buy and again panic sell when it drops and HODLers buy etc.
Hopefully, your 'investment' is not something you need to convert to fiat RIGHT now and you can join the ranks of the HODLers in this silent revolution and enjoy the fireworks, not caring at all about the fiat value in the short term.
The whole crypto market will take a beating in the coming days and HODLers will have an opportunity to acquire artificially cheap bitcoin.

As much as it looks like that on our side of the equation, it simply is what we are told, it is not true. Governments do what banks allow.
When you 'borrow' money from a bank, the bank does not have that money to give you until your signature fills the signature field. At that point the 'application form' becomes a promissory note worth the value that you have (with your signature)  promised to pay - the actual piece of paper has that value (actually it can have a value of up to 30X that value, but that would require you to have further understanding in order to explain to you here).
This is not something I made up:
- Read 'modern money mechanics' a document produced by the federal reserve bank (a privately owned institution, NOT a government entity) which describes this process. Straight from the horse's mouth.
- Watch the cartoon 'money as debt'. It is very entertaining and is much easier to understand. Not from the horse's mouth, but based on what the horse said.
Deposits are even more bizarre. If you 'deposit' 10,000 dollars into a bank account, that bank can turn around immediately and create out of thin air 1.2 millions dollars to loan out.
This is all commercial bank money creation. With the fed it gets even more bizarre:
The treasury needs some money to pay some dumbed down army men to go and die in a fake war and pay employees of  the manufacturers of the killing machinery for tools to kill, steal and oppress people with, so it asks the fed for it. Backed by the promise to pay from the bottomless pit of future (as yet unborn) tax payers, the fed creates this money literally out thin air by adding an entry to it's books  (and this is just the fake money on 'the balance sheets) and 'lends' it to the treasury, who then as stated uses it to suppress, murder, steal and surveil everything and everyone.
It's bizarre, I know, but the truth is far stranger than fiction. There are less than 8,000 people complicit in this 'system' who actually have their greasy hands on the levers of this mechanism and benefit directly. They are outnumbered one million to one.
A recommend that as you research this and uncover the wholesale fraud responsible for all wars since WWI and kennedy's assassination and 911,and,and. and....   That you try to contain the inevitable shock and anger that comes up and channel it peacefully into evangelizing Bitcoin to the people around you.
Not for them to get rich, but for them to get a hundred bucks worth and forget about it, to learn to understand the confusion in which we live, why bitcoin was created and that finally we as a species have a way out if this mess. And then to evangelize the people around them and so forth.

If it goes to zero and dies, fine.

You need to educate yourself. Watch freedom to fascism. The US income tax is NOT a legal requirement. There is no law that obligates you to pay it.

Incidentally that was the thing that wesley did NOT do, which is why he was busted.
He was not busted for not paying income tax, there is no law to support that charge. He was busted for breech of contract as he had previously filed and as such was under a legally bound contract to continue to do so.

It's an old narrative put out by the nasty corporate cry babies who were behind the attempted bitcoin takeover through segwit X2 which failed so they forked to bcash to try the "real bitcoin" strategy - and failed.
It was during the "bcash being the real bitcoin" failed attempt that they spammed the network heavily and fees went way high.
It was eons ago in crypto time.
Very very old narrative.

I hear what you are saying, but this time it's different. He's privileged. He owns banks and insurance companies. When one of his corporations, say coca cola borrows 100 million dollars from one of his banks, say wells fargo, coca cola gets a cash injection to buy up more of all of our water while being able to count that as a liability, meanwhile his bank gets to create billions of dollars out of thin air based on that 'loan'.

This has been going on for years. I've read similar posts hundreds of times. We'll be reading it again when bitcoin is in 70K to 190K range after that particular 'crash'.
All people who aren't looking hear is, 'bitcoin crashed', after countless times through this pattern, i can be certain that is the time to start buying it - as much as you can with what you can afford to lose.
In time it starts creeping up. A whole slew of people get fomo because they hear bitcoin is going up to ATH  AGAIN !! They jump on - crash happens etc.
During this process, as people get in to make money in fiat value, a percentage get it. HODL and NEVER sell back to fiat. The HODL wall goes to a new high.
In time, by trading it between each other for real goods and services and pay for labour, but never for fiat, we'll see freedom from this corporate hell we find humanity enslaved in.

I am actually finding that with all the hype around bitcoin, it is becoming increasingly easy to offer someone bitcoin, explaining that there are many hoops to jump through to acquire it through purchase with fiat, but I can shift you some right now if you download an app, in exchange for that I wish to pay you for, which requires no hoops at all.
I agree though, finding people who are willing to pay you in crypto ain't easy !!!!
@_date: 2018-11-15 04:44:50
You simply don't get it. 
HODLers will NEVER sell. 2 scenarios:
1) It goes to zero and 'fails'.  Well we get to show off to our mates and great grand children that we had the balls and took part in humanity's collective effort to overthrow the banksters - the street cred - just by showing people you still have this 'worthless digital asset' on your phone. The chicken shit, greedy traders that were sucked into the idea that it was some kind of 'digital asset' to get rich in fiat terms won't have any to show. They'll be the sellouts who put their heads down when it mattered.
2) It goes to $100M and we still don't sell. But you can directly buy labour and resources to support the building of a better world. A new economy not dependent on endless fake wars, supporting scared, fat, dumbed down, old, white men suppressing innovation and creative human expression. The people have won. The planet wins. An age of unprecedented invention and prosperity ensues. You, the HODLer, who had the balls and HODLed is respected beyond all others - Way beyond the fake lip service and societally enforced bullshit about honouring the stupid fools who 'died for their country' by paying with their souls for doing someone else's killing. 
For a HODLer, This has NOthing to do with getting rich. But everything to do with creating a field where getting rich is available to everyone, not just the privileged few. An estimated piddly 8,000 people are directly benefitting from the current fraudulent system by direct complicity.
Either way, HODLers will NEVER sell back to fiat. For any reason at all. They bought with 'money' they can afford to lose and sleep well at night that at least they are having a go. It's worth your $1000 dollars just for that.
Sellouts like you will get what karma is dishing out for you day in day out.
Most Bitcoin are HODLed. There's only about 700,000 available for trading back to fiat. And for $1,000 back then when the HODLers tied it all up, they got a fair bit.
Which side of history do you want to be on. Which side of integrity do you want to be on. This is the ONLY question.

The hash wars are in the alt coins space and not relevant to bitcoin.
You missed the whole point.
The entire planet (not just Umercan 'investors') is enamoured with bitcoin not because of 'store of value', anonymity, smart contracts or even utility.
The people of planet earth - especially the smart ones outside of the US - are turned on by Bitcoin for one reason and one reason alone:
It is simply the first bossless medium of exchange in human history.
All other forms of currency are bosscurrencies or in the cryptospace - bosscoins.
You can see by the spectacular failure of bcash how bosscoins don't work. People will not swap the old boss (banksters) for the new boss (latest altcoin 'dev team').

No, those are the AmeriCANs and they are very important.

200 years ago, there was mo 'libertarian' label, that political perspective was called BEING AMERICAN. And it was a revolutionary concept which made America the bright shining light of the world.

I became suspicious when the whole lame stream narrative switched from 'criminals/terrorists' to 'it's an investment, it is worth X dollars, people are getting RICH, it's a digital asset.' 
I was sitting back thinking 'Isn't it a currency to replace fiat? Shouldn't we be looking at how many Satoshi you would have to part with to buy one of those inflating, worthless dollars?'  (Currently about 15,000 sat for a dollar).
When the whole KYC/AML started infecting the fiat onramp exchanges, Alarm bells started going off in my head, so I started noticing little things like Jamie Dimon dumping on Bitcoin, followed by news of JP morgan seeking to purchase large amounts on european exchanges and other tid bits. It became more obvious as time went on.
But it seems that for now, it is still ok. There's only about 700,000 Bitcoin available for exchange, so for now they are relatively locked out. The rest are HODLed by those who understand the silent revolution.
I still spend a lot if time evangelizing this concept of getting all of us real people to just get a hundred bucks worth and forget about it. Our only real strength is our numbers.
Hopefully we get to a point soon where the only bitcoin available for fiat purchase are the freshly mined coins. At that point it really will be direct competition between the banksters and the rest of us.
@_date: 2018-11-09 07:00:02
The concept is Umercan. They are forcing it on the rest of the planet.
All over Asia, it is not unusual at all to see an old lady front up at a bank counter and dump tens of thousands of dollars worth of local currency onto it to bank. No Forms, no KYC/AML, no suspicion.
When asian banks were put under pressure a few years ago to force compliance with FATCA in order to retain the 'privilege' of interacting with Umercan banks and SWIFT and require any account associated with an Umercan entity to fill in the 50 page intrusive FATCA form, they simply elected to longer accept Umercan accounts, as they found it an unreasonable burden to commit the time and efforts of the staff for which THEY pay the salary towards the ends of a foreign jurisdiction. Of course this suits the FATCA authorities just fine as this may result in forcing overseas AmeriCANs to repatriate their wealth back to Umercan controls to be sucked up by AmeriCaNT's. But that is another issue ;)
What I'm getting at, is that the idea of moving your hard earned saved wealth from one place to another without letting anyone else know you are doing so is 'illegal' because it is money laundering, is a very foreign and strange ideas to Asians because THAT IS WHAT YOU DO to protect your wealth. It will take a few generations for the idea to even start making sense to them, laws or no laws, it is simple incomprehensible to the Asian mind.
Similarly for African nations I am familiar with, South America - not so sure, maybe because of drug trade, they are more compliant. But for most of the world's population, the KYC/AML concept is as alien as teletransportation. Pure fiction and bizarre.
And that is a good thing.
And as a result I still view it as a uniquely Umercan CONCEPT or export.
@_date: 2019-01-09 16:03:24

The tiny amount of bitcoin that were bought at 20K by no means represents a significant amount. It does however represent the Umercan fools, years late to the party, who were only in it for a quick buck and are probably onto the next money loser by now.
The 'gigantic percentage' refers to the vast majority of bitcoin that are HODLed, with only about 700,000 bitcoins bouncing around between 'traders' thinking they can increase their fiat net worth with it.
HODLers are in it for different reasons and buy at any price, what they can afford to lose, because they are still offloading fraudulently created and artificially propped up fiat for transparent and sound money Bitcoin.
'Traders' who Hang around, do some study, drop the arrogance, see the big picture and join the silent revolution become HODLers.

Never underestimate the HODL wall.
There's only about 700,000 bitcoin in what you call the liquidity market.
Most bitcoin are HODLed by people who couldn't care less if there was 'liquidity' in the fiat market because they will NEVER sell back to fiat, choosing rather to HODL until there is no fiat market because fiat's fragility is all too obvious and will spend their bitcoin in exchange for labour to build a new world directly.

I've seen this misunderstanding - or misinformation before. Unfortunately these people have not thought it through, nor understand the technology. They have not considered the current state of affairs, quite possibly even paying for their coffee with 'number of the beast' permissioned money as they were writing this garbage.
The mark of the beast refers to a system where none can trade without the mark of the beast - a human number, 666.
The barcode is in fact a push in this direction with the WTO 'regulations' prohibiting sale of Anything NOT bar coded. It also has the numbers 666 in every barcode. The long ones at the beginning, middle and end.
However when taking account this concept of not being able to trade without the mark, it sounds a lot more like the permissioned monetary ecosystem (KYC/AML, third party in between each transaction) we currently inhabit. 
Try traveling across Umerca without a credit card, using only cash. You are locked out of most hotels, car rental, flights -even greyhound bus. You can still find food for cash, but gasoline? Try it. It is possible to do the trip without a cc, but you lose a lot of time and effort finding those alternatives. 
You already need 'permission' to trade, the mark of the beast IS your permissioned financial access.
In summary, we are already there and this final push to go 'cashless', which really means 'go 3rd party Permissioned', it only the last step in the social engineering.
Bitcoin is here to save us from this hell.
You know being permission-less digital cash and all.

Bitcoin being an investment in some kind of digital asset that gets bought/sold/valued in fiat terms to increase your fiat net worth when you 'sell' it, is a bankster narrative designed to hold the whole ship back, slow it down as it were, and keep people from understanding that the Bitcoin revolution is about removing the power of banksters to be the privileged few who can create 'money' out of thin air and pay for endless fake wars to keep us all dumb and oppressed, while they steal everything of real value (resources, land, ideas etc.) in exchange for their air money.

Nowhere in particular, just an observation of the rockefeller narratives as they spilled out over the last 6 decades. 
I'm an old fart and my kid's generation was the first one that got named - the baby boomer generation - then in panic when observing the explosion on consciousness - labelled them as hippies. 
That all came from rockefeller think tanks to try to reign in control over the kids who were being woken up by rock music and conversing with each other, eastern health and meditation techniques and of course pot and lsd. 
It was done by their full control of the media and as of 1973, their full control over the 'music industry', which before that was OUR weapon in mankind's struggle against slavery.
I always called the boomers the greatest generation as it is the first generation in the history of the world anywhere to say 'NO, your war, not our war' when the powers that be created one.
My generation was later named 'the greatest generation' during the 90s as a propaganda push to get GenY to stick. It is double speak. WE TOOK PART in BOTH WORLD WARS. We were the stupid as fuck sheep generation who worldwide did as we were told and with enthusiasm lined up to be slaughtered. There is NO thing great about us other than some if us who survived bringing up great kids who learned to think for themselves and expand their world views.
The genY thing was scary, because it set a precedence for genZ and if the masses view themselves as gen Z - the last generation - it opens the door for slipping into WWIII, which they have been trying to incite for the last 7 decades.
But we beat it, with the millennial label. We already were ready to battle genY label with the following gen being genYnot, but it wasn't necessary genY never stuck - because we had an open internet.
The internet was not centralized and controlled by goooogle and da book o da face in those days, so we were successful in regaining control of an organic narrative as opposed to the think tank agendas.
Since then their development - the like button - very deceptively and creatively has roped everyone into wholesale conformism to THEIR agenda yet again. 
This time the adversary is huge. The NSA is not interested in tracking you for what you might have to hide, but rather to control the narratives and dangerously which of the 2 sides to each narrative that you are being programmed to take, based on your interests and meta data.
It is divide and conquer all over again, similar to the 2 choices the give you in the 2 party duopoly, which I call republoctratism. It is one political party with 2 branches - again, divide and conquer, by putting out stupid 'political issues' for us to pick a side and argue over with pre-prepared sentences to repeat, while they take us from behind and sell out water rights, suppress new energy development, cloud the issue in how money is actually created etc.
For this reason, As futile as my attempts may be in a gooooogle/FB narrative controlled world, I still feel the need to jump on the use of genZ every time I see it.

Where have you been ?!?!?
Many of is have been doing this for years already.  It's a process:
Everyone starts by 'buying bitcoin'
HODL comes next
Spend and replace becomes a way of life - using your mobile phone as your own personal bank.
Then, your brain exits the matrix and you no longer think in fiat terms and it's all about satoshis.
You now sell fiat or buy fiat only when you really need to and it fits your spend and replace ratio.
Everyone has their own ratio. For me, when a dollar costs more than 20,000 satoshi, i find dollars and sell them to add to my satoshi stash. During these times I only sell fiat, I never buy it.
When a dollar costs less than 20,000 satoshi, I might buy a few dollars for living expenses.

What's interesting about him is that he 'cashes out' to bitcoin.  It makes no sense to buy fiat when you are Holding (notice not HODLing) bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-30 02:49:17
There's very few bitcoin available for sale to fiat - about 700,000 of them. The rest are HODLed.
The banks have control of exchanges and run bots on them washing an even smaller percentage of this small amount of bitcoin available, through 'trades' that show downward action to try to het HODLers to sell. 
They can affect the 'price' like this, but their objective is back firing because HODLers HODL and so are scooping up even more of those cheap coins in the wash.
It is wrecking traders, but HODLers are unaware and don't care.

They are both boss coins which came from infighting between the corporate masters at bitcoin cash - commonly referred to as bcash.
Bitcoin has no bosses, no corporate central committee. It is what makes it special.
The infighting at bcash, which led to two separate new bosscoins, has proven to the world the dangers of 'trusting' leaders in the crypto currency world. Many people trusted these salesmen and their vitriol and lost 98% of their fiat investment into their belief in that 'team'.
In short they got badly burned. 
The corporate top down model doesn't work in this new space BECAUSE of the existence of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is the only medium of exchange in world history that has no privileged group at the helm. It is THE reason why the whole world is enamoured with it.
All alt coin are boss coins.
Ignore both bcash versions, they have already shown themselves to be corruptible. Unless you like bosses controlling your money's value, that is.

Oh no, it's not that. I'm in Bitcoin for the long game as well as the real world utility it provides me. 
It's that I never considered the real world effects of not paying taxes on the less fortunate as you so eloquently explained to me.
I've always understood taxes to be legalized theft because that's how they started and how they have always been. Then comes the Umercan state of affairs where taxes service interest on a never to be paid debt to an evil privately owned central bank, to fund fake wars, oppression and mass surveillance.
It really is a conundrum and has my brain reeling.
Despite the internal conflict, I do appreciate your enlightening me though. It is how we learn and expand.
Your perspective is clear and upon reflection appears accurate, so it is just something I have to come to terms with within myself  over time as this added perspective grindingly expands my growing world view.

These are the 2 factors that will add massive fuel to the fire you see igniting.
The good thing is that these people have been screwed over for so many generations that they are wary of top down systems and once they realize Bitcoin is the world's first and only bossless medium of exchange and they don't have to trust some rich fat white guy in an ivory-tower to ledger their wealth, they'll stream in.

NEVER sell coins on an exchange. Sell them or give them to friends who will NEVER sell and understand what the bitcoin silent revolution is really about.
Only buy on exchange to compete with the bankster scum who are incensed that the HODLers are not selling and NEVER will.
There are only about 700,000 bitcoin available for trading, let them scramble and fight for those.
Do NOT let any of your coins end up in THEIR hands.
@_date: 2019-01-22 07:13:29
HODLers never get 'flushed out'. Holders, traders, 'investors', and such are getting flushed out, as are the small amount of BTC the banksters are using to do the 'flushing'.
Every day there are more HODLers who understand that bitcoin is a chance to be frontline in the silent bloodless revolution, simply by cashing out the fiat you don't NEED on a regular basis and NEVER buying fiat with it again.
Note: HODL does not mean don't spend-and-replace. That is just part of the bankster lamestream anti-HODL narrative. It means quite the opposite. Spend away, but replace. 
Never buy fiat on an exchAnge with BTC, is what HODL means.
@_date: 2019-01-29 15:09:30
I've got an idea, let's go to the bitcoin meetup and try and steal the hundred bucks someone just sold for bitcoin. Then we'll take the guy who bought the fiat hoping he'll give us the bitcoin we aren't sure he has.

Unfortunately the 'price' is determined by the tiny amount of bitcoin being actively traded daily. The vast majority of bitcoin are not traded and will never be sold for fiat.
Therefore, the 'price' is NOT accurately reflecting the true value of bitcoin to the real bitcoin HODLers.
It'll balance out. There will come a time when the 'liquid' bitcoin becomes only the freshly mined coins. There will be tremendous competition to get a hold of these new coins and the 'price' will flip and we will all refer to the price of a dollar in Satoshi.

. Both bcash and cripple are bosscoin scams. 
Cripple may be faster than btc as it is not a decentralized block chain - somewhat like paypal.
Bcash is not faster than BTC, in fact because their network is so highly centralized and extremely vulnerable to a 51% attack, most people require many confirmations from bcash, so it is actually waaaay slower to use than btc in practice.
Bitcoin is the world's first and ONLY bossless medium of exchange in history.
This is the OnLY reason people globally (outside Umerca) are even interested in it.
ALL other mediums of exchange (including alt coins) have a privileged permissioned few at the helm. Outside of  the US, that is uninteresting.
Lghtning makes using bitcoin quick and private.  Faster than any other medium of exchange and more private than any 'privacy coin'.

The only way they'll get their hands on crypto is to accept it as payment. 
Interestingly enough, large companies are broke in the real sense of the word. They leverage debt liabilities and assets all day long, but as they are part of the stream, they are actually not solvent without the stream.
When the stream includes bitcoin via LN channels, we'll see an interesting example of gresham's law, where the big companies become pipes leaving the good money with consumers as the companies HAVE to stay in the fiat stream.
There is a global civil war happening.

When it comes to fiat in their bank accounts, Only if they manage to be able to transfer their fiat cash reserves into BTC. They are way late in this regard.
The super rich trade in debt, so they are screwed there as well. 
BUT - their real word assets will still have value and that value will simply be denominated in Satoshi instead of fiat, so in that sense, they should be fine and sitting pretty because sale of those real world assets will net them lots of satoshi.
Dump some fiat and store up a few million Satoshi now and you might be able to buy sone of the super rich real world assets or even better, compete with them by starting real businesses which outcompete their corrupt, environmentally and socially destructive corporate business models.

The problem that exists is the bankster cartel that has the creation of money locked down into their little global monopoly, where a select few (about 8,000) worldwide have direct benefit from creating money out of thin air and the rest of us are their slave class.
This is a serious problem that is the root of all wars, mass surveillance and social ills.
In a way, there is NO OTHER PROBLEM than this.
Bitcoin solves THAT problem. It does take people understanding how the money they work for is created in the first place, which will take time.

It seems you are stuck in that old narrative that Bitcoin is an investment.
It is an exit from a fraudulent system used by a select privileged few (about 8,000 people globally) to game the rest of us and maintain the slave class, endless fake wars, finance fake terrorism and mass surveillance.
Does your porsche 'investment' buy you into the silent, bloodless revolution that quite possibly could end the madness and create the potential for a positive future for your grandchildren?

Yes. 1 bitcoin = 100,000,000 satoshi
1 bitcoin = 114,000,000 rupiah
So it takes 1,14 rupiah to buy 1 satoshi.
If i was in indo i'd be thinking in terms of satoshi, not bitcoin as it is roughly the same as the rupiah.

We don't NEED permission anywhere and THAT is the ultimate truth. Governments pretending to 'legalize' bitcoin are just desperately trying to keep their population in control by pretending that they are in control to the masses who are still afraid of being sent to the principal's office.
Bitcoin is simply a revolution trying to get us back to where  we were a very short time ago - where everyone has the right to trade with another without hindrance. That right brought civilization to where it is.
In reality all the KYC/AML is nonsense if you take all of history into perspective.

The concept I believe everyone is trying to get across to you is that LN is exciting because it is simply the first 2nd layer application, with probably heaps more to come. Like the first real application on top of tcp/ip was email, then FTP, then things like bulletin boards and forums started, then we had usenet groups which were paid for, then we had proprietary systems like microsoft network, compuserve and AOL, then we got www, then bit torrent etc.
I saw the bcash drivel that your friend was repeating to you. Did they mention that the bcash idea is to have a new 200GB block EVERY TEN MINUTES ?!?!?
That is 1.2 terrabytes per hour or 24.5 terrabytes of new blockchain data a day.
I know these folks are 7 years behind and love to quote moore's law (which died 7 years ago), but that is a lot of storage needed to keep up.
They also like to quote nielsen's law which says internet speeds increase by 1.5X per year. I'd like to know where and to whom this kind of speed increase is an actual reality, but seriously, to broadcast and verify 200GB every 10 minutes ?!?!?  The bandwidth will really increase THAT much at 1.5 time a year ?!?!?
There will be plenty of layer 2 solutions besides LN, there will be layer 3 solutions. Some will be through 'trusted third parties'. None of that matters on layer 2 and 3, as long as security is not compromised on layer one.
Bcash was an important spectacular public failure in that it showed the world the danger of trusting the leaders of a bosscoin in layer one 'management'. Compromising layer one security has destroyed any possibility of anyone taking bcash (both versions) seriously, nor any bosscoin.
Bitcoin has no management. Bitcoin is bossless.
'Onboarding' will happen organically as user friendly solutions evolve. Adoption is already way fast. The tech is ever evolving. 
LN is arguably the first real successful use of smart contract in the crypto space.

With all the current bitcoin hype, we tend to forget one very important thing.
Bitcoin captured the attention of people worldwide for one reason alone:
It is simply the very first medium of exchange the human race has ever had that is neutral and bossless, with no controllers. No one is interested (outside of the US) in swapping the old boss (banksters) for the new boss (latest blockchain project team).
Internationally, people are enamoured with bitcoin BECAUSE it is bossless - there is no permissioned central committee.
Of all of the incredible alt coin projects, not even ONE of them is bossless.
Keep this in mind.
@_date: 2019-01-26 15:20:25
Mate, just because you live in a backwards country, doesn't mean the rest of the planet isn't moving ahead without you.
We cash out of fiat to exit the failing fraudulent financial system. No need to go back to fiat (unless you live in a backwater, which you obviously do).
Everything you write bares your ignorance for all to see.

The pint I am making is that internationally - outside of the US, people are turned on by the Bitcoin NOT because the media tells them it is some kind of 'investment' in a digital asset that is valued in dollar terms, but because it is NOT the dollar and because it has NO boss.
All the boss coins have a boss. The nannied Umercans are willing to trust them, globally speaking, people elsewhere are not quite that gullible.
@_date: 2018-11-24 03:36:41
You mean hold for 2 years. HODL means that you NEVER sell back to fiat, whether the exchange tells you it's 'worth' zero fiat dollars or 1 million fiat dollars.
If you are holding to sell for fiat, then you are holding, just like any other investment.
HODL has a specific mindset and purpose, which has nothing to do with some arbitrary 'price' in fiat dollars.
@_date: 2019-01-24 04:29:03
The sad part about your whole perspective is that you fail miserably in seeing bitcoin for what it is. 
The world's first bossless medium of exchange.
Paypal is only a payment processor. Bitcoin does not need to compete with a corporation. Any corporation.
In time ALL corporations - including paypal - will be using satoshi as their currency.
Bitpay and coinbase have to compete with paypal - they are corporations.
Bitcoin has got to where it is without advertising or marketing or even a helpline. Think about that for a full minute.

Just swept that one under the rug, didn't he? Oh..... You didn't notice. Watch it again. I am embarrassed for him. There is a reason the whole world feels sorry for you bcashers needing a bosscoin, you know, someone in charge.

Venezuela - also corporatist. Just that the corporations use corruption to get what they want. Socialism is not something that is supposed to be forced on people. It is just a quicker easier way of corporate tyranny than the illusion of capitalism.

Common experience. Even during the supposed $30 fees, I was paying less than a dollar. A few transactions took a while, but big deal - my landlord and my local farmer. They waited a few days.
The rest went through in a timely manner.
There was way to much hype from the corporate bosscoin crew over at bcash over the fee thing.

Just like not everyone uses plastic, but by and large, many do, enough so that 'western countries' are virtually only plastic.
The number of people using bitcoin to triple only requires each holder to talk to 2 people close to them, load them a wallet and fund a bit in exchange for some fiat. I load about 2 wallets a day for friends and new acquaintances.
Everyone has heard the hype, but hadn't considered themselves as a bitcoin holder ONLY because they assume they are not in that league - like we all know the stock market exists, yet very few of us think of ourselves as people who will ever hold stock.
Once you explain that all they need to do is download a wallet, write down a seed and give you an address and they are a bitcoin holder, I have found EVERYONE wants in.

Terrible writing, inacvurate and irresponsible reporting.
Rhett jones seems to be a repeater twat, or just a sellout.
There are so many things wrong with this story and so many questions that should be asked, such as why is our world so bizarrely dysfunctional that a teenager in INDIA thinks that he can appeal to the Umercan FBI, with which he has zero relationship and they zero jurisdiction over him? Maybe someone in Cleveland who feels they have been defrauded should try to appeal to interpol or the central police in Bombay or Beijing.
That should be the story. It is incredulous. It is also a much more interesting and worthwhile story than just using the weirdness of the story to promote the following false narrative on behalf of the bankster scum and lamestream media - none of which is true:
"we’ve seen horror stories of people going into debt and losing their life savings in the failing market" 
Oh really??? Where? As many as get sucked in by bankster scams like the sub prime debacle, millions homeless ???? 'Failing market' - where is 'the market' failing? Seems to me 'the market' is doing what 'markets' do. Foolish and incompetent 'reporting'.
"Theft also continues to be rampant"
Again, where?? Rampant??? Rampant Compared to cyprus banksters taking money out of people's bank accounts? Rampant compared to fraudulent taxes, hidden tax of inflation and wholesale fraud of a select privileged few printing money out of thin air and using it to dumb people down, surveil  them and pay ignorant army-men to continue with endless wars? Unscrupulous reporting.
" it’s an example of the ways in which the chaos of cryptocurrencies can have ripple effects across so many peoples’ lives."
The chaos? The Chaos Compared to a global dumbing down and world view manipulation agenda that makes a kid in INDIA think the Umercan corrupt police - the FBI, is a place for him to appeal for help. Stupid reporting. 
Rhett Jones is a fool. Pay no attention to him.

Your story IS interesting as I believe this IS the way to get people started.
I used to help people get bitcoin via the exchange runaround, but now do exactly this. Just set up a wallet for them and send them some.
Then explain that as easy it is to transact IN Bitcoin, selling fiat for it is the usual permission nightmare that all fiat third party interactions are. I point them in the right direction, but advise them to really look into it and understand it before getting into the fiat/BTC thing.
It is easier just to start accepting it and let the payer work out how to jump though the bankster hoops.

I agree with you completely.
Fundamentally and philosophically spot on.
Except the part where you believe Umerca has freedoms. Have you ever left? Do you even have a passport? The problem with you AmeriCAN'Ts is that you actually believe the hype that you are free. You have loud mouths and love to judge and point fingers and repeat the party line, but you are ignorant, silly and cowardly. Completely dumbed down. It's a sad joke.
Every single soul born in America is born sovereign, legally codified - like a king or a queen. THAT is what made AMERICA the shining light of the world. Yet you ALL, every last one of you, sells that out immediately, prances around  talking the talk about your freedom of speech and right to bear arms and bla bla bla, but you are enslaved in the mind. 
Exercising your right to buy stuff from corporations. That is it, that is all you fools do. Sell outs. ALL of you.
You have a legally codified right to bear arms so that you can rise up against a rogue gov, 
well Helllooooo - 
your gov is rogue and has been for generations and is now imposing it's imperialism on the rest of us.
Yet all you AmeriCAN'Ts are too busy being led around by the nose keeping up with Kardashians in your cage of the mind while they herd you conformist idiots into the slaughter pens, all the while proclaiming your rights, your freedoms, that you are UMERCAN !!!
You are the only people on the planet LEGALLY sanctioned to replace your rogue government by revolutionary force if necessary, even more so - you are DUTY bound to do so..... Yet..... nothing, nada. Bunch if pussies with BIG mouths.
Meanwhile the rest of the planet, born legally 'owned', has the balls to actually revolt against their gov and lives in relative freedom by comparison to you dumbed down brainwashed fools doing the bidding of your corporate overlords ALL day long EVERY single day of the year.
All you Loud mouthed big talking AmeriCAN'Ts then shoot down the last vestiges of true AmeriCANs just because the overlords you were sold out to said you should. 
You pigeon hole the freedom conscious AmeriCANs as 'libertarian' because THEY (your corporate overlords) gave you that box to label your AmerCAN brothers into.  
300 years ago, that mindset, that understanding of fundamental self responsibility was called BEing AmeriCAN. 
Now you are all choosing sides in a bankster controlled dog and pony show left/right, rep/dem vicious circle just because those are the 2 choices given to you by your overlords. Choose your team and stick with it, now be a good little Umercan, you have the freedom to speak and to choose you know. The big box, the little box, the blue one, the red one. Good boy, there you go. Don't think. Battle each other on stupid 'political issues'.  Stay divided. Ignore those AmeriCAN 'libertarians', they are fringe, not really part of the herd. They won't be going to the prom.
YOU are ALL asleep.
Then The FREE thinking generation comes along - real AmeriCANs, the first generation anywhere in the history of the world to say NO when their powers that be want to have a war - and you classify them into a convenient little box and label them as 'hippies'......  Just because you were told to, for NO other reason. You conformist cowardly idiots. The lot of you.  Now you just call them 'boomers' and blame everything on THEM. Just because your overlords told you to. You have no ability to THINK. Blaming EVERYONE for everything is now the Umercan way. It is what your dumbed down nation does best and is world wide famous for. Blame blame blame. NIMBY. Go bomb someone, they are terrorists. The bewildered HERD now known as Umerca, land of the slave, home of the fee.
And THEN you turn around and label the sellout generation that came before them as 'the greatest generation' (which is the one I am part of incidentally), yet it is THEY who put their heads down when the corporate criminals took control of America. Put their cowardly heads down... And went to buy stuff, because we are Umerca, we are free.
And you call them The Greatest Generation - only because you were told to. A nation of conformist loud mouth cattle being led to the slaughter doing exactly as you are told to do. 
Any real AmeriCAN who stands up (Ron Paul, Snowden, Manson, Koresh, Osho, Dylan...there's a few more) IMMEDIATELY gets pigeon holed by your lame stream media that has 'freedom of speech' and 'freedom of the press' and you just all go along with it AND shoot them down, crucify them - just because you dumbed down idiots are told to do so by your overlords. You are enslaved in your minds!!!
So stop with the BIG talk you silly AmeriCAN'T, you are legally sanction AS A SOVEREIGN to do something about it, yet you are cowardly and dumbed down and terrified of your government who has a tight grip on you - sitting there on the internet pointing fingers at real free people worldwide who are NOT afraid of their governments - our governments are afraid of us.
The world has been waiting for your nation to WAKE UP, shut up AND exact your legally codified DUTY to replace your rogue government.
You have done NOTHING, so now your empire is crumbling because we ... The rest of the people on the planet ... Are not taking it anymore and slowly taking it down, one bitcoin wallet at a time.
See you on the other side. Meanwhile, as you are obviously part of the dumbed down Umercan masses, shit up and get an education.

No, it's a bosscoin with centralized ruling committee. There's nothing new to that -it is the world we live in now, with bankster overlords (who are behind bcash by the way).
What makes Bitcoin special is that it is the world's first bossless medium of exchange.
@_date: 2019-01-07 04:57:14
Of course. They are mostly 'decentralized open source' projects, except the obvious bankster coins like cripploff and stellar scam. 
However, the creators are known entities, usual corporations, which can be tracked down and compromised or even stopped. 
Remember, the adversary in this silent bloodless revolution is the most powerful and ruthless cartel in human history. They make attila the hun look like a benign kindergarten teacher !!!! 
ALL alt coins are tolerated by the powers that be for one reason only: The VERY existence of Bitcoin - the leaderless one. If Bitcoin were not out in the wild doing it's thing, those projects would have been shut down so fast that none of us would have ever heard of them.
Look at what happened to the bcash bosscoin. It had known leaders and decision makers who can change code at a whim with virtually no consensus. 
They could be taken apart overnight by these nasty crooks who are benefitting from the fiat creation scam at the expense of the rest of us.
The whole bcash thing fell apart as a spectacular failure by 2 of the owners attacking each other like school children squabbling over a chocolate milk at recess. Do you think it could have survived the full weight of a gov or the real power brokers that control the governments? They couldn't even survive their own little ego wars.
It may be quite easy to lure Americans into a bosscoin project as they have been taught to deify corporate leaders. But the rest of the world is very wary of trading old boss for new boss. They've been screwed over EVERY time.
In 1997, the entire economy of SE Asia was crashed by one man - George Soros. They haven't forgotten.
People outside of the US are tired of being under someone else's whim. They are enthralled with Bitcoin for the very reason that it is NOT a top down currency, where you have no choice but to 'trust' the top dogs.
These people will NEVER choose a medium of exchange with bosses over the revolutionary one that has no boss.

They aren't. It's wash trading bots. I helped a friend set up simple remittances to his daughter overseas. He's buying and selling at all prices just to use the utility of moving your own money. I guess people remitting don't care about price as just converting fiat to fiat via bitcoin.

You are comparing a bank account with bitcoin. That is a terrible comparison.

In our new bizarre WTO manipulated paradigm, nothing financial makes sense anymore. This is just one of them.
Along with why can you buy a throw away mobile handset for less than the cost of extraction from the earth of the very materials that comprise it? How can a whole chicken, cooked, be cheaper than the cost of growing that chicken, why are bananas in Umerca the same price as they are in the market in the 'third world nation' that grew them?
Why is world debt far greater than world wealth, even worse, why does the total value of derivatives dwarf ALL of the world's wealth by orders of magnitude? Yet, $100,000 of derivatives (money that doesn't even exist) has exactly the same value as a $100,000 piece of land.
Why does the most dumbed down and ignorant population on earth think they are so smart? Why do we allow them to rule is through their evil empire?
Why does a litre of water at wallmart cost a dollar, when the 5 acre pond of fresh potable water up the road containing 100 million litres of it is only worth $70,000 including the 15 acres of land it sits on?

It is a lot different than a bank. 
When you buy a gift card and that money is now tied up in a gift card, does that make the gift card vendor a bank?
You will find many custodial solutions appearing on layer 2 and layer 3, this is not a bad thing. The very important thing is that layer 1 cannot be tampered with at a whim, like bosscoins.    Bcash comes to mind.
In the beginning of the internet, all solutions were custodial to a degree with massive investmemt going into services like CompuServe, microsoft network and AOL.
Then came http and the www
This is similar. At some point these layer 2 technologies will be supplanted by non-custodial efforts.

Only some people quote the 'first mover advantage' marketing term. And it's usually people trying to convince you that bitcoin's first mover is the myspace to whatever alt coin they are shilling's book a da face.
Bitcoin is the world's first and ONLY bossless medium of exchange in history.
That's it.
That is why bitcoin will become the base layer decision layer of ALL value - fiat, crypto, stocks, real estate, etc.
Remember Bitcoin is NOT Umercan. And although Umerca appears to be a huge economy, there are waaaay more people 'out there'.
Those people are used to their value being eroded by foreign powers, banks, corporations and corrupt governments.
They will NEVER choose a bosscoin with some 'team', corporation or organization behind it over the bossless one. Look at bcash - dead in the water simply because it is a bosscoin, when otherwise it is basically bitcoin with a few very dumb changes added to it.
A lot of great tech and creative thought has come out of the alt coin explosion and they will always be with us. But they are dependent on the one unstoppable, bossless, permissionless Bitcoin's very existence.
Without the bossless one out in the wild, NONE of the other projects would be tolerated.
Simple as that.
Forget about 'first mover', that is a marketing term, good for corporations and alt coin projects who NEED marketing. Bitcoin has no corporate email address or helpline, let alone a marketing team. 
The bossless one needs no marketing. The smart people globally are understanding the power of bossless currency.
The dumb dumbs will have to follow.

The ONLY thing to understand about Bitcoin is that it is a bloodless silent revolution to take our planet back from bankster overlords.
This is only possible in the world's first bossless medium of exchange. All other mediums of exchange (especially bosscoins like bcash) have a select group of the permissioned privileged few.
@_date: 2019-01-16 01:08:45
If you say so boss. The bitcoin are 'available' for spending. Replace them by selling fiat at an exchange.
It really is simple:
Exit the system - Sell fiat, say $400. HODL the 10 million satoshi - NEVER to be used to buy back into the legacy financial system.
In time, spend some with someone who is NOT going to buy fiat with it - ie. Not a corporation. Say you spend 1 million satoshi.
Immediately replace the 1 million satoshi by selling fiat, bringing your balance back to 10 million.
Keep your HODLings at 10 million by spending AND REPLACING.
ONLY sell fiat at exchanges, Never buy fiat at an exchange.

It's simple. Next question, 'would you like to?'
I do this all the time. I find that EVERYONE is interested in getting some Bitcoin, but has no idea how simple it is to accept it.
Then they download a wallet, write down 12 words, you send them their first transaction and bingo, they 'accept' bitcoin.
No meed to waste their time with confusing payment processors. Keep it simple and P2P.
They themselves usually realize that the easiest way for them (as a merchant) to get a hold of some bitcoin is to accept payment in it. They also realize that bitcoin customers are still far and few compared to fiat customers, so no need to buy fiat with it. They look at it like savings.
@_date: 2017-09-01 01:43:46

I wish someone would say such a nice thing to me. The archetype that 'normal' people think of bitcoin investors is intrinsically cool. 
Normal people are too busy rat racing in the system to be able to turn their brains on - all by intention of course.

This is correct. And it has happened to me. So be careful. What I recommend is hodl and wait for the price to be at least 50% up before you begin. From that point on, just stay vigilant with replacing. Most of my expenses happen within a few days at the beginning of the month, so I have plenty of time to trade out in the small peaks. As I have a good cushion, it usually works out quite well.
I must point out that I am retired and have very few duties, so I do have time. Which most people don't. BTC also gives me something to do. I jump out of bed of the morning to check the crypto score. It gives me something to engage life with.

Bitcoin is here and it will continue to churn out blocks, whether the dumbed down comfortable 'rich guys' get it or not.
And besides, your 'wealthy' friend is probably just sort of comfortable.

Bitcoin is the ONLY bossless medium of exchange in world history. It is why the whole world is enamoured with it.

Mate, I was there when it happened. It was the start for sure. But HODL came to mean sell fiat, exit the system and NEVER buy fiat with HODLed coins. It never meant don't spend it. That is the new anti- HODL narrative. You are simply a victim of that narrative.
Spend it by all means, but replace the HODLings with more selling of fiat.
HODL is a mindset, not some kind of 'investment strategy' or hoarding.

Not sure why you believe that it costs $10 to open a lightning channel. Maybe your belief is not correlating with reality. Actually, it's about one cent at the moment.
Also, the only people deluded enough to continue with the attempted, but not caught on narrative that LN is expensive or difficult, are the bcash bagholders who believe the world is as they've been told instead of the fluid, constantly changing matrix of co-manifestation that it has always been.
It's not grandma ready, but it is already being used by non-tech savvy people worldwide.
Onboarding - bcash term. Bosscoins need onboarding because the bosses said so.
Bitcoin expands and gets adopted because it is bossless. People find it in their own time for their own personal reasons and 'onboard' themselves.
If you are getting someone started with BTC, It's still easiest to load a phone wallet for someone, have them write down the seed words, point them in the direction of AA Utube channel and send them some BTC as their first transaction. It's the same level of 'easiness' of any crypto, (besides bcash, which gets confusing because of the attempted fraud at bitcoin.com and confusion in bitcoin.com wallet etc.)
Lightning is one simple extra step in blue wallet and will become increasingly simpler as tech gets developed. No need to push it, it has it's own momentum.

He understands that on one side of the equation, his fiat is being devalued to the tune of 80 billion dollars of freshly created (out of thin air by a select privileged few (about 8,000 people globally)) every month and on the other side of the equation his bitcoin is NOT being created out of thin air by a select privileged few.

Nice try, but wrong!!
HODLing is a statement, a revolutionary act. It is exiting the fraudulent system.
I do agree with you that bitcoin has to be spent though.
That is where spend and replace come in. This is part of HODLing. To HODL simply mean NEVER buy fiat with your Bitcoin. It doesn't mean 'don't spend it.' That is the false narrative.
We spend bitcoin with people and small businesses who will also HODL and spend and replace.
I keep my BTC hodlings at around 14 million satoshi. I HODL that by spending and replacing. When I spend a million BTC, I sell some fiat as soon as possible to top my BTC balance up to 14 million or above. Hopefully above.
We take btc off of the bankster exchanges by selling fiat and THAT BTC NEVER buys fiat again. It is exiting the system.
HODL literally means spend and replace.

There is no need to convince your family anything. Just start accumulating and spending bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-11-07 02:59:26
Just buy regularly and spend your time learning about what Bitcoin is actually about.
As much as the bankster owned governments and lame stream media are spending billions trying to convince everyone that bitcoin is dome kind of digital asset which we buy/sell and value in dollars - a type of 'investment', that perspective is NOT true and is designed to slow down the message. And that message is: 
Bitcoin is the world's first unowned currency, which is created transparently and requires no permission to take part. It will in time become ubiquitous and replace the dollar as the measurement by which ALL value gets measured, including the IS dollar.
This idea terrifies them as it removes their power to create money out of thin air to use to throw fake wars, murder, steal and oppress people worldwide. Not to mention pay for the very expensive surveillance apparatus - the NSA.
Get in for the right reasons. Buy only what you can afford to live without and spread the word.
This is the silent revolution, led by thinking people GLOBALLY. This is very important.
Watch all VDOs of Andreas Antonopolous. It'll all start to make sense.
Get everyone you know to hold $100 worth of bitcoin and NEVER sell it on exchanges - the banks are trying to gobble it up. They are holding a ridiculous amount of fake money in the form of derivatives and they are trying to land it on the bitcoin holders in return for real money - bitcoin, in exchange for the fake dollars. 
Do NOT fall for this. And spread the word.

Don't worry. 
Remember that you are a sentient being who has a spiritual right to express their interests, even it may be 'frowned upon' by societal influences.
Don't open your door to any gestapo agents. Say (through the door), I'm here, I'm unarmed, if you have a warrant, break down my door, I am standing back. If you have no warrant, you'll have to go get one if you want me to open the door. 
If you get hassled by gestapo forces, be polite, but say NOthing, except 'officer am I free to go?'. If the arrest you, again, say nothing, just smile and wait. They can only hold you for a short time.
 
Give no other conversation, none at all. ZÈRO.
If your package arrives, look at it with some confusion and leave it on your doorstep unopened - in case you are being watched. Leave it there for a while. At some point, clean up your front porch and again look at the package with some confusion and toss it into the bag you are putting trash into. Put the whole garbage bag where you normally put your garbage before you put it out for collection.
At some point without being seen retrieve the contents of the package wearing gloves, but leave the package in the garbage.
Never open your door to gestapo. Never talk to them. NEVER agree to anything or sign anything.

They will when they can pay directly on bitcoin for those ads to advertisers who won't just exchange back to fiat on an exchange.
But remember, Bitcoin is the silent revolution, where daily, people are waking up to understand not only what bitcoin is really about, but how fraudulent and silly the existing legacy system is.
We should stop expecting large corporations, which benefit from this ludicrous state of affairs, to adopt bitcoin or accept it. 
Bitcoin is not corporate Permissioned money, it is our money and in time you will see a massive shift away from this idea that everyone needs to have a job with an evil corp and spend their money from an evil corp transitioning to an era with many small enterprises built on spending our money with each other. This will unleash an era of unprecedented creativity and personal manufacturing, while corporations become relics of what will be seen as a dark time in human history where poisoned and brainwashed people actively and voluntarily took part in the destruction of our planet.
Or We'll all just die, poisoned and disempowered by centralized corporate authority resulting in unbridled corporate plunder.
The revolution is NOW, it is between people and corporations...  AND bitcoin is the mechanism of the people (and most importantly, 'people' includes people who work for and support (through commerce) corporations).

Average Joe will be last. 
Bitcoin attracts intelligent, curious people, people who understand the bankster fraud and wants out, people who are being squeezed by the closing in of the surveillance net etc.
These people reflect one of the fastest growing 'demographics' there are - those who are waking up.
For a long time to come Bitcoin will not be for average Joe, unless something happens to him and he enters his transformation stage.
This is ALL good. The holders of the bitcoin will be the awakened. Much better than the current fraudulent fiat model where the holders are pretty much dumbed down, boring, insecure, unimaginative and given to violence and force.
Don't worry about average Joe. He'll get scammed by bcash first, go through being a buttcoiner or nocoiner after the bcash raping and eventually be using satoshi on the lightning network, not even knowing it IS Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-01-11 09:50:40
Even after the very public war between the bcash leaders, and the tremendous losses people who trusted those leaders incurred, you still pretend it wasn't their personal project?!?!
The cognitive dissonance is palpable.
Bcash is even less secure now because 2 of your bosses split from each other, forcing all bcashers to choose their favourite boss. Now they both have their own bosscoin.
As if it could have gotten worse, it already did.
Beware bosscoins.
@_date: 2019-01-06 07:19:29
That's the party line, but so far the fastest is bitcoin with lightning. There's heaps of disinformation and misinformation and lots of straight out lies coming from the bcash bosses.

This is the key point. Those that do the study to learn the tech to a degree develop strong confidence in it. The math is consistent.

'Mountains of unconfirmed transactions' , 'horrific fees'
Nice narrative, but untrue. 
Although It is true many people didn't know how to set their own fees and wallet providers were unprepared for that kind of run up in price so many people paid fees that were 'horrific', but that was because of those wallets and people not realizing they can set their own fees. I had no trouble during that period with all of my transactions under $5 (which to me is very high already).
I transact daily, so I am very familiar with what happened. Many of the people pointing their fingers at the situation were people who do NOT use bitcoin on a daily basis for transactions.
I had 3 transactions for under $2 which were stuck in mem pool for more than a week, but the receivers didn't mind as they were not needing to transact immediately. 
But pretending that the SET FEE was $50 is disingenuous.
The mountains of unconfirmed transactions: Again, it was almost all micro-transaction spam. It was an attack from the butthurt corporations behind the attempted takeover of bitcoin via the HK and NY 'agreements' that the users were not notified of until it was already 'agreed' by this group of corporations. 
The day the USAF activated, I threw a party with a group of like minded friends because THAT was the moment we KNEW that the world's first and ONLY bossless medium of exchange had weathered the top down corporate attack. 
It was the first time in history that the users (or customers, consumers) beat the corporate top down 'policy' driven model that is slowly destroying everything.
The resulting bcash fork was the corporate attempt to fool people through media and advertising. Again, we the people saw through it. Again it did not work. Again, cause for celebration in the world wide civil war that is pitting people against corporations. 
The world is not interested in Bitcoin being a bosscoin. The infighting between the bcash bosses showed what a spectacular failure a bosscoin can be when the bossless one is here.
Just keeping it real.
@_date: 2019-01-09 03:17:42

Too bad all the old people in India who would've remembered Gandhi are dead.
Gandhi would have encouraged EVERYONE to use crypto for the purpose of getting their bank to close their account.

India needs to promote a crypto rush so that banks are snowed under trying to close all those accounts.

@_date: 2017-09-06 08:51:55
I agree with you, however have you considered the idea that when you suddenly launch a currency which has never been used and is quite different from any monetary instrument we've ever had, it might take some time for us - the market - to discover it's true value?
Until it does, people will treat it like an investment. Some of us don't value BTC in fiat already. Rather we value fiat in BTC. This is a change that has to happen inside of individuals. 
You should see how volatile US dollars are from that perspective. Up and down, but overall downward trend due to devaluation through printing.
If you saw it, you wouldn't want to HODL any :)

Unless of course you mean the current fiat valuation of bitcoin, which appears to be 'falling down', but take note that the system corrects itself, there is no one in a back room making a political decision able to change things to prop it up. THIS is what draws people's attention to it.

As in, is the country run by people who are dumber and thuggier than the rest of the population as we have in the west?
Because if so, which may well be the case, then they'll start making the same dumb assed mistake again, but then hopefully get hauled back in line by the wise, educated and intelligent class. Of which China has many.

What we are ALL learning AGAIN, that BItcoin is far more resilient than anyone considered.

You haven't 'lost' anything. You still have the BTC.
It may not be transferrable to the fiat value you paid for it and this very minute, but the BTC belongs to you (assuming you have the private keys).
I have a friend who bought the high in 2013. It was years before the price came back. The whole time he was happy to have the BTC instead of fiat. He never sold.
The scary thing is when you change your BTC into fiat and you watch your investment in fiat getting eroded daily by forces that mean to steal from you.

I've watched bitcoin from the sidelines for years believing this. Since it crossed $100. I never bought. Don't repeat my mistake.
Buy what you can afford to lose. Buy for the right reasons - the possibility of the end of fake fiat funded wars - and HODL. That means NEVER sell back to fiat.
EITHER bitcoin becomes the standard by which ALL currencies , crypto And fiat, are measured
OR it disappears as a currency all together.
Bet on the former scenario, but ONLY with money you can afford to lose.
Forget about 'the right time.'
Relax, enjoy the games.

It can't be a coin other than bitcoin. ALL other coins - bosscoins (alt coins) have known founders. People in the US may be quick to accept a new boss (alt- coin X team) to replace the old boss (banksters), but the rest of the planet is wary and tired of the boss paradigm and is interested in bitcoin for one reason alone:
The introduction of the world's first bossless medium of exchange.
Bitcoin is the ONLY bossless currency.

The 'middle man' is only temporary and valid because we give them that power. Ince we've broken our addiction to their money, we won't need exchanges OR banks. This is the dream of crypto.
Also, 'the price' is only volatile for now. Wait until it is ubiquitous and we decide that EVERY other currency is volatile as bitcoin stays consistent. 
There are no currencies which are not valued and such pegged to Fake federal reserve dollars.
The current bank infrastructure is coming apart at the seems, there is no need to save it.

OP wasn't talking about protections, but more about his personal realization of the difference between transactions that are pulled from you because anyone with the cc info is actually 'authorized' to pull from your account in functionality in the same way that if you were to hand over your private key - which is a push function. The funds are pushed from you not pulled.

My life is simple. I've been in my community for many years. With age, you get some benefits. People oblige your requests. I am on retirement benefits, so I really have to watch my spending. Consequently, I make most of my bill payments within a few days. I simply asked all my regular billers to take BTC because it would just be so much more convenient for me, you know having to trundle to the bank and whatnot. Everyone obliges the old fella :)
It might not be so easy to do the same for younger people, but try. Talk to your landlord, corner shop, etc.
For bills. In my country we have an online wallet which will process all your utility bill payments for you in fiat.

Smart. Fiat loses value daily. BTC over 3 or for months as almost always increasing in value.
Keep saving. Keep up the good work.
When you are well ahead because price is up start to spend and replace as soon as you can.
HODL.  Then when ahead change gears to spend and replace. It'll serve you well.

That's so sweet of you, and very flattering. But I must inform you that it is quite possible that I am old enough to be your father or grandfather.
However, about my net worth, you are correct. Although, it would be considered significant for most people, it is very little when I compare with retired friends decades younger than me. Friends my age are long gone.
I am able to survive on my retirement at almost zero interest rates purely because I am almost 100% in BTC, when it comes to cash on hand. It allows the meager income I receive from traditional investments to suffice my living expenses. From 2008 until 2015, I had to cut into my capital and divest stocks just to pay my monthlies. For roughly the past 2 years, I have had money left over at the end of every month.
I respect your opinion on the obvious stupidity, it is however, working out very well for me to do so.

Wrong. It is the HODL which will cause the real flippening - when everything is valued in bitcoin or satoshi.
At some point ONLY the freshly mined bitcoins will be traded on the exchanges because of us real HODLers.
The competition for these new coins will be fierce, the 'price' will sky rocket. HODLers still won't sell, because a real HODLer NEVER sells to fiat. Only spends and replaces.
The billionaires will have to scrape and fight to get a hold of a single bitcoin.
Planet earth experiences an unprecedented era of peace, prosperity and understanding, setting the stage for thousands of years of harmony, where this current murderous era will be taught as the Largest human tragedy in history and the generations that lived them will be viewed as the wholesale pussy sellouts that we collectively are - watching the kardashians.

Oh ok. I'm not so familiar with the US, but it does seem to be waaaay behind in Bitcoin understanding. Seems everyone there believes it is some kind of digital asset to trade in with fiat. Strange.
I guess Venmo is an Umercan thing then.
It's just another third party payment processor, right?  There's heaps of those to choose from.
Outside of Umerca, people are into Bitcoin because it is a revolution of consciousness and the world's first bossless medium of exchange where there is no third party in-between you and your customer.
Many people also view it as a way out from under umercan imperialism and oppression.

Goldman Sachs realize what is happening and that they will not be able to get a significant amount of fiat into crypto in time because the availability is quite low.
They have a plan AND they have an unlimited supply of fake fiat. They know that through the media, if they can keep everyone on the same page with the narrative that bitcoin is a digital asset valued and traded for in fiat, then through greed and fear they can manipulate the market enough to get some of those coins. The important thing is to keep 'the market' on the idea that the valuation is done from fiat, which is ludicrous because fiat is constantly inflating.
Don't sell your BTC to goldman sachs. HODL. Stay vigilant. 
But most of all, retrain your brain to the correct narrative:
'Fiat is a commodity you buy with bitcoin to make a purchase, if bitcoin is not accepted.' 
Just like if you were Traveling in venezuela now, you would only buy as many bolivars as you need right now or today. You would keep your 'value', in dollars because tomorrow the bolivars will come cheaper and your dollar buying value increases day by day. 
Currently it will cost you about 25,000 Satoshi for a dollar. If your new jacket is $100 dollars, you'll need to buy them in exchange for 2.5 million Satoshi. Is it worth 2.5 million Satoshi to you? Should you wait a few months when it will only cost you 2 million Satoshi or less? Decisions decisions.

I guess it comes down to WHY you buy bitcoin.
To increase your 'wealth' calculated in fiat value as an 'investment', or so you have heaps of it when the time comes that bitcoin is what you earn and spend?
I will HODL my tiny amount until it IS widely accepted or forever if it goes to zero.
I am happy to have served the greater good for all future generations by taking the fruits of my labour out of the bank (where it just gets used by big corporations that I don't agree with to cause even more environmental damage) and into bitcoin (where it hurts no one). This is enough for me. If it goes to zero. Fine. At least I was in the fight :)

Spend And replace has the potential to support the market in an extreme way.
You spend BTC, you replace it by buying with the fiat you would have spent. The merchant takes your BTC and possibly hodls it. If not they change to fiat. Eventually, the merchant will choose more often NOT to trade back to fiat and maybe pass that duty off to their suppliers and staff.
They will see the wisdom in holding cash reserves in BTC over time and this decision will make them more profitable.
People keeping their savings in crypto will move ahead over time and those still in fiat/banking will be left behind.

It really is time we just called it Satoshi.
Right now you'd have to divest yourself of about 25,000 Satoshi for a US dollar. Indonesia has 300 million people who are used to thinking of 15,000 rupiah being equal to one dollar. A Rupiah will be worth one Satoshi relatively soon.
We need to learn to value fiat from the point of view of BTC because bitcoin is consistent through math.
So a dollar costs 25,000 Satoshi, not a bitcoin costs 4,000 dollars.

Great great piece of writing.  
It is very important that the developer community not sellout like they did to create the centralized clearnet - That they understand how important they are in mankind's endless fight against slavery.
It is through selling out that THEY take over EVERY TIME. Just look at what happened to music since 1973 when the bankers finally had control of most if the industry - decades of sellouts followed. Hardly any real musicians were invited in and zero prophets. They were traded for profits.
Thanks for taking the time and putting in the effort.

It's simple. I buy BTC at 2000. When it's up, say 3000 I buy some milk. That BTC that I spent cost me less in fiat than if I was to pay fiat straight up for the milk. Then there's a dip to say 2600 and I replace the BTC that I spent. That puts me ahead again.
Just spend and replace. But be sure to replace !!!

No, OP is right. Baffle them with bullshit. 
Corporations are starting to believe they NEED a blockchain. Take the money they want to throw out.
Make sure they are well confused and know they don't know anything. Charge an obscene amount of money to solve this problem they are incapable of understanding. Take a deposit or retainer, invest it in BTC.
Take their existing database, turn it into DLT, centralized in their offices, pretend it is really difficult. Spend months on it with a 'dedicated team.' Deliver their 'blockchain' and move onto next corporation that believes they NEED a blockchain. Take their money.
It is a waste of time trying to teach them that they should just change and adapt to the existing REAL immutable blockchain. THEY DON'T WANT THAT. They want to be in control, yet they want a blockchain. Give the crybabies what they want - a fancy database.
Just like Y2K days.

Because the network is relatively quick in tracking broadcasted transactions, most nodes will have similar mempools, changing slightly but quickly. Each miner scoops up a bunch of broadcasted transactions, hashes them and starts to find the nonce for that particular hash. If that miner finds the nonce before anyone else has found their unique nonce based on the transactions they scooped up, that miner gets the reward. Immediately all miners verify the math and upon verification stop hashing the block of transactions they are working on and scoop up a new bunch of transactions from mem pool, thereby continuing the race to find a block. 
I hope this helps.

I've been saying this on many threads for a very long time now.  As I spent some time many years ago living in Indonesia, I had become accustomed to having to part with 20,000 rupiah to buy a single dollar. I think it only costs about 13,000 rupiah for a dollar now.
The point is over 300 million people are already accustomed to these kinds of numbers that the Satoshi is in range of. Humans ARE capable of valuing dollars in Satoshi quite easily.
Skip the bits and millibits, it confuses the average person.

Over the years I've noticed that those who are in far the big picture do well and find zero difficulty on hodling, but those looking to increase their fiat wealth lose.

Better than whoever has the most legacy fiat and is the most corporate sellout mentality puppeteered by the banksters deciding the future of bitcoin.
Raising the biggest rabble might not be the best solution, but it IS how democracy works. And as shitty democracy is, it is better than the alternatives.
It makes it the responsibility of the individual to decide if the join the rabble, oppose other rabble, create new rabble or stay out of the kitchen.

There are no downsides to having multiple nationalities, unless one of them is US. The US passport is the ONLY one to avoid holding.
And as much as a country wants to tout that it 'doesn't allow' multi citizenship, THAT country does NOT have jurisdiction over the other country giving you a passport, so it is a joke to 'not allow.'

We leave N Korea no choice. Bitcoin allows them to trade with other nations. It should never be one nation (or in this case - one bank consortium) which decides which country can and cannot trade.
As much as you may disagree with the leader's ideas - he's a human being and has a right to his ideas.
Have you ever heard N Korea's side of the story?
None of us have. We blindly follow our corrupt as fuck banks and gov and tAlking heads without thinking for a moment there may be something else behind it.
Like the fact that the last big bad enemy is also the last country standing who refused to be part of the rothschilde banking scam. Syria, Libya, Iraq etc are now compliant and as a result are no longer the big bad enemy.
N Korea has got balls and we should celebrate their strength - the strength of the human spirit - in holding out to maintain their independence from these leaching scum.
The US gov has been bought and sold and zombies abound, their heads filled with the banker propaganda and misinformation.  THEY have enslaved YOUR thoughts and you are unable to see this.

If you have already moved from hodl to spend and replace, it is the only way to think of it. Dollars just get cheaper and cheaper.
Despite some ignorant redditors complaining that I repost similar comments about this, I will repeat:
I find it easier to think in terms of Satoshi, as in a few months ago I had to fork over 25,000 satoshi for a dollar, then it was 20,000 .....  And now... 16,000.
A few years ago even 100,000 satoshi was just dust.
Really the dollars just get cheaper and cheaper.
Just remember to replace what you spend at or above the satoshi price (or below the dollar price) you bought the dollars at.
It is fiat that fluctuates, bitcoin holds a steady path.
Money badger keeps moving.

What, like save it? Maybe under the mattress? Seems to me people are doing just that - treating it like money.
Spend and replace is the new HODL.
If you are more than 50% up. Pit some coin in a spend wallet. For every financial transaction, ask 'do you take bitcoin?' Set them up with a wallet. Then replace what you spent as soon as you can at or below your 'spend price'.
Keep this up. Keep collecting dust. It'll be worth a lot. Just a little while ago 0.00x was dust, now it is significant.

There is nothing wrong with being anti-capitalism. The system which supports a few at the expense of billions.
Don't confuse capitalism with free market. Capitalism favours capital, NOT the free market. 
Currently what we call capitalism is actually corporatism, a system rigged to make it easy for corporations to 'do business' and a ton of rules and regulations to block the rest of us from ever competing with them. Corporatism as we have it now is closer to socialism than 'capitalism'. 
In socialism everyone works for the state. In corporatism, everyone has to work for a corporation. Same difference.
In a truly free market, the vast majority of people work for themselves.
In effect what I an trying to get at is that you have bought the idea that somehow capitalism, freedom, democracy and prosperity are the same thing. This is a program that has been installed into you by Edward Bernays on behalf of THEM. And we know who THEY are.
The free market on the other hand is what people do. They will always do it. People trade. It is fundamentally human to trade. It is when that trade gets coopted and repackaged with regulation for one group and a free pass for another that problems develop.
Socialist countries - even communist countries - have a free market going somewhere under the oppression. It is always there. Same with capitalism and corporatism. Somewhere under the mess favouring dumbed down privileged suits on wall st, there is always a free market lurking.
The free market is now under attack again (see silk road, alpha bay etc). And we call it capitalism ?!?!?!?
Bitcoin is just the natural progression of the human spirit rising up against oppression and in this case the oppression is coming from the misguided world view that capitalism is good, when clearly it is dangerous and destructive to all living things.

They really are still trying to beat this dead horse narrative.
What is it like 10 months old already, this narrative?
Meanwhile, the message spreads, the silent revolution gains more and more people daily, who are not only becoming bitcoin HODLers for the right reasons (to kill central bankster and corporate control of our lives), but becoming aware of the top down forces in the media, the censorship at gooooogle and da book o da face, and the way legacy fiat actually is fraudulently created.
These lame narratives are simply failing to stick amongst thinking people - who are the only ones who count at this stage of the game.
It is estimated that there are a mere 8,000 people that truly benefit from fiat money creation out of thin air. That's less than a crowd at a sports event.
Did someone say OUTNUMBERED 1 million to 1 ???
The revolution is real, it is not on gooooogle, it is not on da book o da face, it is silent, it is creeping and it IS people vs corporations. And that includes people who work for corporations.

Companies and corporations have to change with the changes taking place and accept that they will no longer be in control and will have to compete on a level playing field like individuals do.
This whole world view of having to keep companies comfortable and in a cushioned protected environment because it is their right to make money is dissipating quickly thanks to the existence of bitcoin, which was the catalyst that started many people looking at this mess.  
Let the corporate model die it's natural death and stop propping it up. Let the governments return to serving the people. Let the militaries of the world rust into oblivion as their bankster owners become irrelevant fragments of a tragic history. Let the talking head propagandists get their due and then try to find valid forms of income. Let the police forces go bust and then have to 'compete' for their place in the community (at the bottom of the ranks) by serving the community instead of stealing from it.
Let the suits and the sellouts starve and live in homelessness.

Blue wallet is NOT BTC.
BTC needs to remain decentralized and bossless. If people choose to use centralized methods of transferring the bossless currency, it is actually fine - to a degree. As long as it is impossible to control BTC, in the way that bcash or the other corpcoins or fiat can be.
Most people worldwide do not use whatsapp for communication, and the option to NEVER use it still exists. 
Ultimately, I have to completely agree with you as the real problem is the unbounded idiocy of the general person to give EVERYTHING away in return for 'convenience and security'.

@_date: 2017-10-26 16:58:21
It will definitely go to Satoshi, no doubt about it.
I remember the 1000 lire dollar, the 20,000 Indonesian Rupiah per dollar. 
Most people on the planet use a currency with lower valuation than the US dollar. Right now we are at 16,000 Satoshi for a dollar, soon we'll be on parity with the modern day 13,000 Indonesian Rupiah Per US dollar. 
Only Americans view 1 dollar as one dollar. For the rest of us it is a much bigger number than that and often orders of  magnitude off of parity with the US dollar.
Think about it, a technologically advancing nation with a population larger than all of north America being used to their currency At 13,000 rupiah per dollar and suddenly Satoshi are 1:1 Rupiah.
This will happen in the coming months. currently, Also in line, (this list is in no way comprehensive):
. 
0.7 Satoshi for a Vietnamese Dong.
 12.3 Satoshi for a Myanmar Kyat
146 Satoshi for Japanese Yen.
160 Satoshi per Nepalese Rupee 
320 Satoshi for a Philippine Peso.  
500 Satoshi for a Thai Baht
873 Satoshi for a Mexican Peso.
These are significant populations who are increasingly technology obsessed and well aware of inflation and banking stealing your savings from you, which are not that far off parity to Satoshi.
Millibits and such still end up being useless to a population far far bigger than the US or Europe. It is only a handful of Countries for whom millitbits may necessary (for wrapping  your head around the number as this thread suggests) as an intermediate step to Satoshi also being at parity with even those government issued currencies.

What you call human nature is conditioning. There have been many cultures on the planet which shared everything - even women and children. Corruption is a learned state coming from fear and insecurity. For sure it is not human nature. During the war, and I was just a child and early teenager, the normal population pulled together and community was strengthened. It was the governments who behaved badly. The people, the human nature, was nurturing and supporting of each other. Much more than you see in non war time community. This is human nature. Corruption is distortion of the human state, forced upon us by government.

It is definitely measuring the loss of fiat value.
In the legacy system most countries peg their currency to the US dollar and then inflate the shit out of it, so you end up  with thousands of vietnamese dong to a dollar. That's all fine and well when there is no stable point from which to measure the 'value' of the US dollar and the rate it is inflating at.
Well, now there is. 
We can now measure the effect of inflation on top of an inflating currency. Price wise, it is basically becoming Bitcoin vs the entire basket of fiat currency.

The vast majority of bitcoin use and transactions are initiated outside of the US with it's piddly 30million users.
None of us in the rest of the world has even heard of bitpay (unless we venture onto reddit) and coinbase we know is just a lame Umercan corporation trying to 'be compliant' in an intrinsically non-compliant space (internationally at least). We laugh at the yanks.
In malaysia, and nigeria, luno users can exchange fiat to bitcoin directly from anyone's bank account through an app, no questions asked by anyone.
Do you think the average Japanese bitcoin user cares if bitpay or coinbase call the new alt coin bitcoin or not?
They wouldn't even know it was happening.
How's that for KYC?
Let them have their 2X coin, it is irrelevant to bitcoin. Out here, we won't even notice they've gone.
Hello Umerca.... There's 162 odd other countries out here and we don't give a shit what your corrupt corporations say or do.
To us, bitcoin is a way for us to be able to live without being under the yoke of Umercan imperialism and petro-dollar. As if we give a flying hoot what your silly and obviously ignorant corporations think say or do.

I just read tour post again and realize that you are still thinking in terms of 'accounts'.
Accounts are for banks. In the crypto world we don't have accounts, unless when you have BTC on an exchange. Then you have an account with that exchange platform. It is always advisable that you move your BTC or other crypto from your account with a third party (the exchange) to your privately controlled wallet. At that point the BTC are in your wallet, similar to if you moved account funds at a bank to your physical leather wallet.
That being said, I really would like to recommend you go through the sticky at the top of this post. The more you understand the technology and how it works, the easier it will be for you to understand and use.
Seeing that you have your fiat in Euro, it probably makes sense for you to open an exchange account at bitstamp.
Download a wallet from app store or google play. There are many. Mycelium, bread wallet, blockchain wallet etc.
Each wallet can contain any number of bitcoin addresses. Be sure to follow the instructions on backing up your wallet with the recovery seed.

I must say I actually did laugh out loud. Crypto is ALREADY changing banking.
In Asia, everywhere you look, banks advertising smart phone apps where 'you can send money to each other' (lie - it is sent via the bank) with zero fees.
Only 2 years ago, a bank in those parts having zero transaction fees was unheard of.
Banks now have to learn to compete and serve customers.
They will fail in this endeavour. It simply is not in their corporate culture to do so.
Banking fundamentally prints money out of thin air through fractional reserve system. This fundamental nature of banking will completely disappear.
They are losing the power to print at will.

Not necessary. We haven't had a multi decade rogue gov colluding with corporations and the super rich to dumb down the population. Therefore we have a relatively Small dimwit population.
Umerca has had such an agenda running.
America on the other hand remembers that it is special because all AmeriCANs are born sovereign and that it is not only your right, but your duty to seize control of your gov if it no longer serves you. You are duty bound to do so. You are the only country on the planet to be legally sanctioned to do so. Yet...... Kardashians ?!?!?!
In my country we do stand up to our gov, they are afraid of us, not the other way around, yet we are not legally codified with that responsibility. 
In my youth America actually was the bright shining light in the world and we were blown away by the IDEA of America and the citizens you met were AmeriCANs.
Decades later, you've allowed your corporate masters to overwhelm you with media drivel, distract you and corrupt you, label free thinkers as 'conspiracy theorists' and generally put intelligent people down like rabid dogs. So now we are left with Umerca - a nation of AmeriCAN'Ts.

B2X is a downgrade and therefore is an experimental alt coin run by corporate interests.
Bitcoin is not controlled by corporations. Bitcoin is an open source community project where developers are welcome to contribute and review (or should I say review and contribute).
As I understand it, B2X is a closed shop invitation only corporate fool's paradise.
In effect, this is a downgrade as currently bitcoin is not a closed shop.

The only words that come out of your mouth in ANY police encounter are: 'officer, am I free to go?'
Other than that, keep your mouth shut. Do not consent to search. Do NOT allow them into your house. That means, do not open your door. Tell them if they have a warrant, they are to force entry, you are unarmed and standing back from the door AND you are streaming VDO. If they have no warrant they will not force entry. Sign nothing. Let them try to intimidate you with a 'hearing' or 'arraignment',   At that point ask for a jury trial in front of your peers as your constitution guarantees for you.
This is how laws change. Use your right to remain silent - completely silent. Sign nothing under any circumstances.
@_date: 2017-10-10 03:32:24
Yes I did and I think you may be right about the tether thing. Cheers.
The main thing is, when we look at crypto as a way to increase our fiat wealth, we are already running on the programs that THEY have instilled into us.
The way to look at it is, that we save our money in the currencies that people will use in the future instead of 'saving' constantly devaluing debt based blood soAked fiat currency, which will be worthless shortly.

@_date: 2017-10-27 02:58:19
For most people in the world Satoshi parity with their currency is  getting close to or already very real:
 
For example, currently:
0.7 Satoshi for a Vietnamese Dong.
1.28 Satoshi for an Indonesian Rupiah
 12.3 Satoshi for a Myanmar Kyat
146 Satoshi for Japanese Yen.
160 Satoshi per Nepalese Rupee 
320 Satoshi for a Philippine Peso.  
500 Satoshi for a Thai Baht
873 Satoshi for a Mexican Peso.
These are very palatable numbers. Yet in Indonesia the exchanges still quote 780,000 Rupiah for 0.00100 Bitcoin.
They could just quote 7.8 Rupiah per Satoshi or of course 1.28 Satoshi for a Rupiah. I would think this would be easier for them.
There are 300 million bright, wonderful people there who are increasingly technology oriented.

And yes, there ARE many who make the 'better than Bitcoin' claim, but not a single one of them is bossless.

Bitpay and coinbase are irrelevant to bitcoin.
They are only relevant to Umerca, which is sad for Americans and even American'ts. But on the global picture, most users haven't even heard of bitpay or coinbase.
Consider just one country - japan.
Do you really think all that bitcoin activity has any relationship to these 2 corporate clowns? NOT
The scary thing would be if localbitcoins supported the 2X attack. They still have by far the largest trading volume.
And 'payment processors' are only that - payment processors.
I am hoping that their ignorant corporate dumbed down boards are to stupid to realize this and get crushed in the process. Would suck for Umercan bitcoiners, but hold the line. It would be great to show the world that the corporate mindset is so last century and is no longer a valid profitable way of looking at 'doing business'.
Bitcoin and the fledgling ICO mess is redefining how we look at 'doing business' - and this is the exciting part.

This is BTC. It doesn't just evaporate.

And no, for a guy who transacts a few times every day, I have only paid more than a few cents during a famous period of time when many small transactions were filling the mempool, which were funded by the increasingly irrelevant Saint Bitts LLC bosscoin guys.

@_date: 2017-09-14 13:28:27
Stepping out here :)    If I got any of the following wrong, please correct.
The whole point is to secure the network. Although maybe when the mempool is empty, Each miner will grab mostly the same transactions, it's very unlikely they'll grab 100% the same transactions. When this block of data is hashed, the hash will in no way be similar to the hash of any block being hashed by any other miner. Then the race begins, all miners start throwing a value at their block's hash to see if the result comes up starting with one or more zeros depending on the difficulty. They don't  start this race at the same time, but when they have a hash value to nonce in this way. The winner broadcasts the proof, miners verify it, if true they dump the block they were hashing and grab a new batch of transactions. 
The block gets accepted to the chain, simplistically, it's hash is now hashed together with the block state hash thereby creating a new block state hash and getting permanently sealed in history. In this way the network is secured.
If everyone was to mine different transactions, it would not fulfill the function of securing the network. 
Why? 
I'm not so sure. I'm surprised I got this far :)
Any corrections are welcome and fill in the gaps of my understanding.
Help!! Anyone? 
@_date: 2018-07-28 02:14:14
They've lost control of their government, much like Umerca. The difference is that, unlike Umerca, they are aware of it.

That is hilarious. I think you aught to review the actual history and WHO made this agreement.  
What pisses me off is that in june 2014 a group of people got together in Bangkok and we decided on the Bangkok agreement for bitcoin.
The whole community backed out of our agreement. The whole community breached our agreement. All of those bitcoin users are frauds for not honouring our agreement.
And now just because a few corporations in New York made an agreement, it is something that "can't be backed out of".  What makes this NYA agreement more valid than our Bangkok agreement. 
Is it only this business-centric idea that NY businessmen and wall st are better than the rest of us?

Which is odd.
Download blue wallet. (Yes, it is 'custodial', but the money it holds BTC , is not. If you are still using banks and credit cards, then you already 'trust' custodians with your money.)
Anyway, send your BTC to that wallet, put it on a lightning channel, teach your baker, butcher, tire fixer, etc to also download that wallet. Send them your payments and have them do the same.
In this way you can send very small amounts of Satoshi to each other.
It makes no sense for an economy thinking in Bolivars to think in terms of BTC, it makes much more sense to think in Satoshi.
Once you have your bluewallet downloaded, work out how to send an invoice - by selecting send, make a 20,000 satoshi ($2) invoice and post it as a reply and I will send you one month's minimum wage. I think 20,000 sats is about 40,000Bs.

Thank you. Very clear. I learned something and what you say makes perfect sense.
@_date: 2019-09-13 04:08:52
Because BTC on lightning are more liquid. They can move very quickly and virtually for free.
I can pay a farmer for his eggs and he can immediately pay his part time helper, who can then immediately buy some cheese from the cheese lady, who then immediately pays her phone bill at bitrefill etc. 
All of that can happen in the time it takes ANY blockchain to process a single transaction or any cc, bank, paypal, venmo, WU etc for that matter.
The speed of money moving is something people have yet to consider.
There's a reason it's called lightning.

And yes, a million a month is not so fast, it doesn't even keep up with population growth. These are very early days.

And no, you haven't 'missed the boat'. 
This is a global silent and bloodless revolution. Get a hundred bucks on BTC onchain and another hundred on a couple lightning channels.
HODL the onchain forever and spend and replace from the Lightning channels.
Be productive, offer quality goods and services people are willing to give you satoshi for. Keep good savings habits - adding to your onchain HODLings.
You will prosper and grow wealthy over time.
Secure money that when saved cannot be eroded by inflation or gov whims and corporate shenanigans.

Most people who spend more than a half hour there realize it's the same 50 user names commenting back and forth to each other on every single thread 24 hours a day, no meals, no sleep.
It doesn't take a brain surgeon to work it out.
It's kind of embarrassing that they keep doing it.

I'm amazed that no one can see that this apparent calamity of a sovereign nation banning or not banning BTC, is having hardly any affect on bitcoin. 
Normal downwards bubble forming as panic selling takes place, sure, but a crash??
 The end of crypto??  Really??
What we are ALL learning AGAIN, that BItcoin is far more resilient than anyone considered. By consensus, the population of the world that is bored of the war, crime and oppression is choosing bitcoin. The current market is only reflecting the buying and selling of traders who view the world from a fiat perspective.

Oh, please excuse me, so 2 people then.
There's only one bitcoin. Don't confuse yourself. 
The corpcoin forks are just personal pet projects of corporate minded millionaires that thought appealing to consumer mindset BTC users (who need a road map, SOMEONE IN CHARGE) would work and that also tried to hang onto the coattails of BTC -  which was a dismal failure.
Although those corpcoins do rely on miners being honest and users uneducated and gullible, with no need for node operators to encourage miners to be honest, Bitcoin does not need miners to 'be honest', the node operators, the users, the businesses, and yes, the miners. We all take part in consensus. It takes all of us. 
That is the true genius of Satoshi's work.
@_date: 2017-10-23 04:46:07
You have a RIGHT to gloat.
I was just watching bitcoin back then and it scared the shit out of me. I never invested anything at all at the time, all the while quite happy to dump $50 on a round of beers for my mates down at the pub.
You on the other hand jumped in and had a go.
Gloat away my friend. It is the guys with balls back then who made this happen. You ARE one of them. 
I unfortunately was the scared pussy not willing to 'risk' $50.
It is laughable, but it WAS scary in those days. We forget that part.
Funny thing is, people will be saying exactly what I am saying now about the bitcoiners with balls who purchased at pre &amp;10K prices.
I AM one of those

It's how America was built my friend. 
The ideology that created America during the continental congress and reigned up into the early 20th century which the whole world called 'AmeriCAN' and made America the shining light of freedom in the world has now been labelled and pigeonholed by the bankster scum who usurped the power and the AmeriCAN consciousness in 1913 as 'libertarian'. 
This is why the place is now known as Umerca and is full of dumbed down AmeriCAN'Ts - it was all by design.

Instant and fee-less = lightning. There is no other secure bossless and permissionless way to have instant AND feeless.
On chain cannot be instant or feeless, no matter what you've been sold AND no, zero conf doesn't count. Would you make a $3,000 transaction and not wait for confirmation? 
Instant feeless transaction of $3000 is already possible on LN and we are still in Beta.
The future is catching you while you are stuck in 2016.

There are more bitcoin in the population of iran than Umerca. It swept through in 2012 and people bought a hundred bucks worth understanding the dream that just maybe their hundred bucks could help secure a future for their grand children free of Umercan imperialism. They bought for the right reasons and NO ONE is selling back to fiat - even at 1 million per coin, they won't sell.
For these people it has nothing to do with 'getting rich' in fiat terms or lambos. It is about the survival of the Persian culture through this onslaught of Umercan and Islamic oppression. They are some of the hardiest stoic people on the planet who are thinking generations in advance. Even in the troubled times they've had over the last few generations, there still has not been a single case of starvation - they understand community and they look after each other.
We could all learn something from them.

You can download bluewallet, which iS cUsTodiAl, (like your  BTC at conbase, your credit card, bank account, insurance etc.)
With that wallet freshly downloaded and empty, you can receive BTC already in a lightning channel.
They've made it silly easy to get started.
@_date: 2017-10-16 01:55:20
Be careful. I've noticed over the years that people coming into this space to increase their fiat wealth - invariably lose.
Make the mental switch. The idea is to be involved in the currency of the future because it is our money, not their money.
Those that do this seem to win over time.
@_date: 2017-09-07 00:27:55
I don't think you got my point. Sure BTC price charts are prolific. And sure I can do math, but I'm not sure how to manipulate the chart to flip the axis. I am looking for a chart that measures the price of a dollar, not a chart measuring price of bitcoin.
You see the difference?

It's part of the bankster backed lame stream narrative.
If they can keep people thinking that Bitcoin is about gEtTiNG riCH in fiat terms by 'investing' like the 'early adopters', then they might not make the connection that it is actually the world's first and only bossless currency.
That it might in fact be a people's takeover, a silent bloodless global revolution.

Weird how your perception changes.

Libertarian is not on the scale between capitalism or communism. It is on a perpendicular axis to both of them. In a true libertarian state, community becomes the central pillar of society.

You are kidding, right?
Thousand of small transactions filling the mempool with set fees as large and sometimes larger than the transaction itself - miners paying themselves, while the corporate goons behind the HK and NY agreement were indignant that the people should thwart their corporate agenda?
If you can't see the connection, You are either not able to think rationally or simply chose the corpcoin and so your ego won't let you see it, being 97% down and dropping on an average of 1.5% a week.
As for transacting for sub cent. Try it. Don't have to believe (trust) me. Do it. Send yourself an onchain transaction. Set the fee insanely low, the worst thing that'll happen is it take a few hours to confirm.

Not in Thailand.
A Thai Baht is only worth 500 Satoshi, so much easier for those 70 odd million people just to go straight to Satoshi.
How about this list, countries which combined dwarf the populations of white countries:
0.7 Satoshi for a Vietnamese Dong.
1.28 Satoshi for an Indonesian Rupiah
 12.3 Satoshi for a Myanmar Kyat
146 Satoshi for Japanese Yen.
160 Satoshi per Nepalese Rupee 
320 Satoshi for a Philippine Peso.  
500 Satoshi for a Thai Baht
873 Satoshi for a Mexican Peso.
The confusing bit-millibit-microbit is just that - confusing. And for most of the worlds population, unnecessary.
It'll go straight to Satoshi.

Seems you have gaps in your understanding. ALL of the members of the continental congress built America by ideals that today would be called libertarian. For most of America's history those ideals were simply called AmeriCAN.
You have been duped and dumbed down by the banksters who took over in 1913.

Outside Umerca, sure.
In Umerca, they still believe BTC is some kind of 'digital asset store of value' that gets bought/sold/valued in fiat dollar terms. In short, they've  missed the whole point.
Outside of Umerca, people understand that Bitcoin IS the silent bloodless revolution, which is why adoption is happening outside of Umerca.

If conbase completely disappeared, it would have very little effect on the flow of USD in the longer term - only short term.
Bitstamp is orders of magnitude bigger than the conbase, and the asian exchanges like binance are at a whole other level.
Umerca is still a completely insignificant player in Bitcoin.
THEY have been holding Umerca back by selling the narrative that Bitcoin is some kind of 'digital asset' or 'store of value' that gets bought/sold and valued in USD.
God forbid the Umercan people realize it is a currency.
The first and ONLY bossless currency in the history if mankind.

Oh, the 'small block' narrative.
No. Wrong again, like you seem to be about many things.
The whole thing was about keeping Bitcoin bossless, which WE - the users - did with the UASF, therefore the following insane runnup in price.  People worldwide were enthused that the promise was true, that Bitcoin is bossless and cannot be taken over by corporate interests. They tried, they failed, they forked off.

Those dollars just get cheaper and cheaper. 
Amazing time to be on the planet.
When a dollar costs 13,000 Satoshi, satoshi will be on parity with the Indonesian Rupiah. A currency used by more than 300 million people.
Soon I'll be able to pick up a buck for under 10,000 Satoshi. I used to call that dust.

Just for your Americo-centric information, this is where the vast majority of the population is concerning Satoshi:
0.7 Satoshi for a Vietnamese Dong.
1.28 Satoshi for an Indonesian Rupiah
 12.3 Satoshi for a Myanmar Kyat
146 Satoshi for Japanese Yen.
160 Satoshi per Nepalese Rupee 
320 Satoshi for a Philippine Peso.  
500 Satoshi for a Thai Baht
873 Satoshi for a Mexican Peso.
These are significant populations who are increasingly technology obsessed and well aware of inflation and banking stealing your savings from you, which are not that far off parity to Satoshi.  
You can try the confusing as hell mico/milli/bit thing, but it just isn't useful for virtually non-white country currencies.

I demand the math be accountable. I demand the code be responsible for fitting into my narrow ignorance.
Maybe we should make bitcoin a legal person just by deeming it so in some fucked up legal manner. And then what ???
Arrest this person? Cage this person? Fine this person? Bring back the death penalty for this person?

If it is a system which is centralized where we the people have to trust someone - for sure it will be corrupted.
But if the system is open and transparent and leaderless, it is quite possible. How about basing every thing of value in bitcoin.
Then gov can print to their heart's content, they can even throw fake wars.
THEY just won't have total control how value is determined. And so the real effect of their actions will be open for all of us to see and their manipulation will decrease the value of their currency.
Right now, this actually happens, but people don't see it and accept inflation as normal.
It will make the governments competitive and eager to serve the people instead of faceless organizations.

I for one, would like to know based on actual real implementation of anything at all (communism, socialism, free market, even capitalism) that is not directed somehow by the powers that be. All we know is monarchism, fascism and corporatism. we've never seen another authentic attempt at anything else.

It is inevitable. The dumbed down money goons are finally understanding the HODL wall. This makes bitcoin 'safe' in their badly distorted view. More money will be stored in bitcoin for sure.

When your 'application for a loan' is 'approved', your signature on it turns it into a promissory note worth 2million dollars. That 'note' is then sold off and rebundled continually down into the derivatives black hole. But what's interesting is the other side of the equation where through the magic of fractional reserve money creation, the bank can now create out of thin air and lend out up to 30 times the value of the note, which in this case COULD be an additional 60 million dollars.

Just another attempt at trying to keep everyone thinking along the lines of BTC 'price' in their fiat as if their fiat is the REAL money with which to buy and sell BTC.
When in fact it is already true that the REAL open fair money is BTC and if you like you can buy some inflationary fiat with it and quickly spend it before the inflation devalues it more :)
1 dollar is now worth 0.000363636 BTC. Better to spend it quick before it becomes worth less as it is intrinsically worthless.

Yes, and it all seems just a little too convenient that he would off himself. We know for sure that whatever drivel 'the authorities' utter is bullshit meant to deceive. Add to that that the media and it's bankster owners now have another opportunity to slow crypto down with more FUD as they try to buy in as much as they possibly can.
This whole story stinks to high heaven.
Also, what are the US letter agencies doing performing 'raids' in a sovereign country. All of it is too weird to comprehend. THEIR story makes no sense at all.

I'd love to, but don't have a lot of time. i'll do my best in just the few minutes I have. Be careful. It will be in your metadata that you've looked at this stuff. 
SO All of the following is most safely done using TOR browser, preferably using tailsOS.
 
First: read this 
secondly, go to duckduckgo.com and search for Edward Snowden revelations to find out how insidious it is. every search, every site visited(how long you spent there, where you cursor hovered) , every comment, every email is sent directly to NSA file on you by way of collating your metadata. 
Third. Do not EVER use goooogle search again. The results are terrible and it is a terrible search engine anyway, so nothing to lose.
To start to learn how a filter bubble works watch:
This is how they control the narrative and why you hardly ever hear an original thought any more. We are told what to think, which 'view' to take based on which box goooogle has put us in.
Fourth go to wikileaks and search vault 7 revelations to see how much worse it has become SINCE Snowden.
Fifth, learn how to ungoooogle yourself and in time move away from using gmail altogether and only access your gmail via TOR browser. See unseen.is for relatively secure email. Learn about gpg encryption AND use it.
You'll have to learn a lot, this is very time consuming stuff. They have embedded themselves into each of our lives. You'll have to develop new browsing habits, get rid of your windoze machine and start on linux. Again, it has taken me hundreds of hours which I will never get back and which no one compensated me for to untangle their tentacles from my online life. It is not easy, but you can get there from here.
Be aware that your mobile phone is completely insecure, but do your best. It is simply a clearnet device and HAS BEEN COMPROMISED. Just be aware of that and only use it to talk about the weather and search recipes. NEVER use chrome or safari. Dolphin browser os ok and brave better, but they are still clearnet browsers, so be ware of how you use them and for what. Use lineage OS to be free of goooogle to a degree. 
Assume that you are always under man in the middle attack.
NEVER use goooogle location 'services' unless it is on your designated clearnet device and you are careful and understanding of how you use it.
FB - everything I've said about goooogle, but worse. Apple - Steve's dead, apple is part of prism. So they are just as bad.
This leaves us only with the only worthwhile goooogle service - Utube. It is unavoidable, but access it only on TOR and VERY importantly understand how TOR needs to be used to stay anonymous. Hit the new identity button often and enjoy your viewing anonymously. Never do a clearnet activity in the same session as you watch Utube, hit the new identity button first.
More resources you'll need on the long road to being goooogle free.
TOR project
  
If you can get one get a riseup email.
It goes way way deeper, but here's a good start. Sorry, already hundreds of hours worth here.
Most importantly, stop using THEIR money as much as you can. HODL for sure, trade for sure, but USE THE CURRENCY!!!!
And remember we ALL have something to hide by THEIR definition of terrorizer.
Peace and good luck.

I don't think the wall street scum will drive the price, it will be people trying to hold onto $20 without it being taken from them by banksters - if they could even qualify to be stolen from in the first place.

WOW, I had no idea. Do you live in Thailand? I'm very curious as to what is going on there. I have great memories and lost touch with so many good people I knew there back in the day. Didn't have email back then :)
Is the government still military? Is that a good thing? I remember in 91 or 92 trying to explain to friends overseas that 'the military regime' sounds so ominous in our western ideas, but in Thailand they seemed to be the people who really seemed to care for the people and the country. Is that still the case?
Thank you for touching base, I really am curious, so hard to find any real news.
I learned to love the King and have had a life long respect for his work. I read the whole treatise on self sufficiency economy in my youth and it changed my life in many ways. I actually cried last year when I heard the news of his passing and had this great surge of realization that his legacy is inside of all of us who really noticed his example - even us dumb foreigners :)
I always suspected that there were big foreign business interests who wished to see the whole monarchy disappear - I worked for one of them and it was soul destroying. I did what I could back then to constantly stick a spanner in the works of the evil corporation I worked for to slow them down and confuse them in their efforts to strip the people of their culture. It was satisfying to play a small part in righteousness for the remarkable thai people.
Of course the time came where I was transferred to another post and I never took the chance to visit again. All of this was decades ago, maybe before your time.
I really am curious how things are really going. Did the corporations manage to finally subdue the nation and finally colonize Siam after centuries of failing - we were doing it through marketing and television. The general idea was to create an idea through the 'modern' media that somehow anything that didn't fit our agenda was simply 'old fashioned' and backwards in some way. I tell you, it really was soul destroying. I did what I could, but I was a tiny little pawn. My 'transfer' came about 1 year after I started into meditation practice. That was The biggest gift I received from the kingdom - how to find piece of mind within yourself. I always suspected I was 'transferred' because of my new inner life. They could tell Thailand had changed me. My colleagues used to accuse me of 'going native'. I always answered that the western culture has way way more to learn from Thai culture than Thailand could ever 'learn' from us.
I am especially interested in the Chinese business angle you mention as I always thought the assault was coming from multi-national corporate suits like I was.

Also, to become a teller you have to fill in a form via a goooogle product. I have been goooogle free since The Snowden revelations and it blows me away people still use their draconian system since vault 7 releases.

It's a shame, I remember a few decades ago when i lived there Thailand was truly a sovereign country. Now because of the corrupt fanagling of the CFR through their puppet Taksin Shinawatra - a known criminal who was prime minister for a bit - it is simply a vasal of the rothschilde/rockefeller empire.
Let's hope they can recover their century long ability to stay uncolonized and sovereign.   They are amazing people and a truly enlightened culture. A travesty and pure shame watching them succumb to the overlords NOW of all times - when we all know the truth of the failing bankster agenda.
They should have protected him and enlisted his savvyness to help ward off the relentless attempts by the inheritors of the dutch east india company to control them through the NSA surveillance state criminal enterprise.
If anyone could do it, it is the giant family that is still remembered as the kingdom of Siam.

Very unlikely. Ethereum is a great idea and worth supporting and being part of, but it is an inflationary crypto - unlimited supply. BTC will only ever have 21 million in circulation. For sheer 'price' per coin, it would have to be a coin with issuance capped at some value. 
The non mineable ICO coins, (i guess karbon is just another one of those, but have actually never heard of it), very unlikely. 
It would have to be a mineable coin with an independent blockchain, decentralized and unowned, created by an unknown entity and capped circulation. BTC is currently the only thing that matches that description.
Maybe it the future someone will anonymously create a coin and disappear, if that coin attracts miners and users, then maybe. But for now it is BECAUSE bitcoin exists that all the alt coins can exist, otherwise they would be shut down so fast it would make your head spin.
That bitcoin is decentralized and controlled only through network consensus is WHY people trust it and why it will always be the most valued.
@_date: 2017-07-21 11:17:20

Good point. You don't lose 'money', you've gained BTC. Sound money. That's the whole point. It isn't about what constantly inflated fiat value it has. 1 BTC will always equal 1 BTC. That that 1 BTC will have more purchasing value over time compared to ANY fiat 'money' is a no brainer. It is by nature deflationary.
On the fiat side of the fence, they are printing like it is going out of style - because it is. On BTC side of the fence, there will only EVER be 21 million. Simple math. It is like land 'value' going 'up' over time. It has more to do with there is not much new land creation happening, but 'money supply' just keeps expanding. A lot of the apparent 'value' is just a reflection of the devaluation of the fiat itself. The 'value' of the land pretty much stays the same generally, but the 'cost' calculated in fiat changes reflecting the increased supply. 
And remember we don't hold - we hodl. :)

Funny thing that. I just had some BTC remitted to me from another country and the sender instructed my to buy physical gold bullion with it instead of remitting by bank or western union. I have the shiny gold in my bedside drawer.
Did I miss something? Did I get something for nothing? Did I perpetrate a scam on the poor seller. Should I have her message you so you can enlighten her on the valuelessness of the BTC I sent her? 
Please, help me out here. I've lived an honest life. I don't want to be party to a scam even if it is helping out a relative in purchasing REAL gold. I am prepared to return it immediately in return for the no real value bitcoin I sent her. i'll send the valueless bitcoin back to my relative and let them know I will play no part in such a bitcoin scam and insist they lose time, money and privacy using an established REAL remittance system if they want the gold. Send me real dollars to my Euro bank account, because after all that has REAL value, right?
Please let me know as soon as you can. I'm headed back over to apologize and set things straight. I'll refer her to your wisdom and you can let her know the truth. I really didn't mean to screw her out of real gold with value less bitcoin. Honestly.

The bribe miner double spend would not work on BTC as the non mining nodes would reject those blocks.

Good point. Who cares??
Some privileged dork who has never been productive a single day of his life, just using his background, connections and influence to leach off of actual productive people buys BTC and for some reason we should give a shit? 
These people are not as intelligent (not talking about privileged education, but raw intelligence) as the rest of the population. I know heaps of them - dumb as shit. They are treated as smart because they are in a situation where they can  manipulate and systematically transfer other people's wealth to themselves and not be labelled as thieves. That doesn't mean you are smart, it means that you are a thieving prick.
The point is, in real life, without their cushion and safety nets and  contacts, they would be nowhere near smart or resourceful enough to compete with the average person. They have not needed to hone their skills, develop themselves, or learn to make friends based on something that isn't coming from pretentiousness - for generations.
I'm much more interested when a normal intelligent member of non-privileged society sees it.
They are the ones who got us this far - the smart people who get the idea itself, not the insecurity riddled 'investment shills' who can't think beyond themselves and IMAGINE anything that hasn't been spelled out to them by their 'system'.

You are right. 
But what went wrong in the past is that a small group of people were fooled be corporate narratives through proof-of-social-media that Bitcoin's path forward is determined through 'debate' and then SOMEONE IN CHARGE will pass down the directives decided in the debate, in corporate fashion.
This small group was further screwed simply because they did not understand consensus. 
When the corporate takeover methods failed for the first time in history, those cry baby corporations forked Bitcoin, ignoring consensus as it didn't go their way, then attempting to fool people through the usual corporate PR methods, that the corpcoin bcash was ThE rEaL bItcOin.
Total corporate failures. A joy to observe and be part of by running USAF client on our own nodes. Very empowering.
Now that even smaller group of bcash bag-holders (all 50 of them) hang out in the hijacked rbtc sub spouting those same tired and very old corporate narratives back and forth to each other, as if it makes a difference.
It has become a desperate lonely corner of the internet full of deception and anger.

Just FYI, both BTC and LN are open source projects, which by there very nature do NOT have bosses, directives, deadlines or roadmaps.  Those are all concepts deriving from the corporate top down model.
In the open source collaborative world, if you think something should have been ready long ago and you are unhappy about it, there is no one to appeal to to demand your product arrive when 'promised', but rather you join the effort by getting involved.
This is the main impetus for the bcash corpcoin fork. Some marketing people and corporate heads got together to appease the few bitcoin users stuck in a consumer mindset and who want SOMEONE IN CHARGE, to give them what they want and make a killing in the process.
Sounds like You may have drank the corporate coolaid - that 'crippled' line is a corporate slogan put out by Saint Bitts LLC, so is the confusion about having to have a funded channel in order to receive funds and the false narrative that LN is THE ONLY scaling solution.
You need to step out of the repeater box, drop the corporate false narratives and do some study. I am in my ninth decade and I have been all in on Bitcoin for years already.
I used to make hundreds of transactions a month and always thought it was silly that this old fool's $4 purchase at the farmers market showed up directly on the blockchain.  I have since opened 8 channels on LN for about 30 cents total and have made close to a thousand transactions for those 8 cents and my silly purchases don't need to show on the blockchain. The speed is unbeatable by ANY standards and the privacy - well, again, unbeatable - and I really like that. No need for mixers and shufflers, etc.
That being said, the base layer works just fine. I have not paid more than 8 cents in fees ever, besides during the spam attacks where I paid $6.43 for a transaction and had another $2 transaction stuck in mem pool for 5 days.
In future, you won't know if your transactions are via LN or not, unless you want to. Opening and closing of channels will be seemless and in the background.
There will be many second and third layer solutions besides LN, the base layer block size will increase when consumer grade technology can accommodate it. There is no need to panic about getting the entire planet involved RIGHT NOW. I myself have already done 12 transactions personally in a single second on LN, just for fun.
Have you ever used bitcoin on the bitcoin-cli ?
It used to be the ONLY way to send, receive and store BTC. It was clunky, confusing, scary and nerdy. Every user used to be a miner and have the entire blockchain updated to transact. It definitely wasn't 'ready'. But we were using it.
Things change. This is open source development. It will all seem clunky and nerdy and confusing until suddenly, seemingly, it isn't. And everyone will be talking about how they wished they were involved in LN when  it was developing and reminisce how clunky it was.
Don't be left behind because you believed the corporate lies. The world is moving forward. Play with the tech, get involved, set up a node. You'll learn heaps and you'll be in the revolution with the bossless one - the only one that ultimately matters - because it is the ONLY bossless medium of exchange in world history.

I agree.
That minority of consumer mindset bitcoin users simply didn't understand consensus nor open source development, they needed SOMEONE IN CHARGE and the corporations behind the segwitX2 corporate takeover attempt were more than willing to promise to fill that consumer mindset need to deliver NOW based on a top down directed corporate 'road map'. Thus that particular corporate greed driven alt coin was born.
So far, just like in general computing, open source has proven to be more valued by the market.

Not talking about proprietary corporate forks here buddy.
Talking about clients supporting big blocks on the actual Bitcoin network. They exist, yet no one runs them. THAT is consensus.
Also, that client software running on unused corpcoin chains, requires centralized dev and devision making in order to keep the clunky thing going, as demonstrated many times, least of all in the last fork and the recent bankster style roll back of the ledger. Putting our trust in yet another boss (the new boss), simply is not what this revolution is about.
Satoshi seemed to be very good at math. It's the minority consumer mindset braindead, following the slick corporate narratives, that seem to have trouble understanding exponential probabilities. 
But hey, Einstein said that that is the one thing humans, having been indoctrinated into linear thinking, have the most difficulty in doing.
Second layer is already used more than any other alt coin. It's coming along. Patience. It is the future, which is different from the present. When something is the future, it may not be the present yet.
Past = before now, present = now and future = AFTER now.
Seems your logic fails as much as your math.
That desperate place full of corporate false narratives may show a quarter as many subscribers, but a heap of them are banned users like myself, who never bothered to unsubscribe. The rest are bots.
You only need to spend a half an hour there to realize that 90% of the posts and comments are dominated by the same desperate 50  users repeating the same corporate doublespeak non sense back and forth 24/7 - with No need for sleep.

Consensus is decided by nodes choosing which software to run. There were and still are plenty of Bitcoin clients that support big block, but nobody runs them. Probably because they can do math.

It's all a myth deriving from the fake 'block size debate', propagated by bankster backed corporations intent on the take over of Bitcoin.
At the time, those of us on rbitcoin looking to learn about bitcoin were constantly harassed by a very tiny minority of user names who just would not shit up about this fake debate and who obviously could not fit the idea of open source protocol development or consensus through voting by choosing which client to run, into their brains.
It was obvious corporate astro-turfing. 
What they called censorship by being 'banned', to the rest of us was a relief. We were here for real discussion about real things, not to 'debate'. These people were attempting to colonize every thread with corporate propaganda. There were just a handful of them and they seemed to be able to post 24/7, without sleep or breaks.
Bitcoin's direction is not decided by debate and some kind of top down directive, but rather by the magic of consensus - simply choosing which client software to run.
Clients supporting big blocks were being run by some miners and some non-mining full nodes, but very few.
For Bitcoin to go the big block route, it did not require a 'debate'. That is the top down model, it's not how open source works.
It simply required nodes to choose to run a client which supports big blocks. End of story.
There was not enough consensus. Node operators sat down with a calculator, realized just increasing the block size would be counter productive at that stage and elected, by their own judgement, NOT TO RUN BIG BLOCK CLIENT SOFTWARE.
This is how Bitcoin works - by consensus !!!
Bitcoin is a collaborative open source protocol in development. The concept of open source leaderlessness is very hard for humans to grasp as we've become accustomed to ALL systems being hierarchical or top down in nature. The corporate model being a classic example.
The very big corporations in the space were eager to consolidate their power and even more so, they lusted after control of the protocol's development. They spent a lot of time and PR propagating 'the debate'. Their goal was to end up with control over the code and it's development.
They had 2 closed door back room discussions and labelled them the HK 'agreement' and the NY 'agreement'.
The idea was that Through force or the HKA and the NYA, everyone would run THEIR corporate owned closed source bitcoin client.
Problem was they went about it all corporaty, thinking that THEIR agreement would of course become THE agreement. That all of us users would HAVE TO go along with. 
This is, after all, how the corporate model functions.
This is the way corporations operate and have always operated. It is directives from the top down, decided after some debating.
It didn't work. WE THE USERS thwarted their plans for taking over Bitcoin with the User Activated Soft Fork - UASF.
This was a great day, not only in the history of Bitcoin, but in human kind's endless struggle against slavery. It was the first time EVER that the corporations didn't call the shots.
They were baffled, confused. This had NEVER happened in corporate history.
Understandably these cry baby corporations were butthurt and re-acted very stupidly. 
After failing their takeover attempt with segwit 2X, it clearly shows how arrogant they were in even considering forking a version that they control (the bcash fork) and then through PR, lame stream media support and social media astro-turfing, they would convince the world that their version IS Bitcoin.
You would have thought that their segwitX2 failure would have taught them to respect the power of a leaderless, open source project with as many eyeballs on it as Bitcoin.
But no, there is no end to corporate/bankster arrogance.
They deceptively tried to convince the world that bcash IS Bitcoin, with their false narratives about how a tiny company with a token investment from an evil bankster group - AXA, that this tiny company Blockstream somehow pulled off the impossible and gained control over an open source project.
I recommend viewing this youtube clip in order to learn how open source project work in a systemic sense. It is simply impossible - systemically - for any one person or group to take over.
There is literally ZERO evidence that AXA has any control over Blockstream, or that Blockstream has any control over the open source bitcoin collaboration.
It is all lies. 
If you go to the hijacked rbtc sub, where censorship is REAL, you'll notice the same 50 user names repeating the false corporate narratives to each other 24/7.
They are stuck in the corporate top down world view consumer mindset where they simply prefer having SOMEONE IN CHARGE. 
It has become a desperate, dark and lonely corner of the internet. All in all, BTC has gotten stronger.
It is the warding off of the segwitX2 corporate takeover attempt which spurred the ridiculous bull run bubble.
Many people worldwide, on the sidelines doubting Bitcoin's anti-fragility, jumped on board. 
Judging by active addresses and the 97% tank in bcash value, it is pretty obvious that almost all OG Bitcoiners sold their bcash airdrop for more Bitcoin.

I live in a developing nation, so my income is way under what most posters here would consider normal.  I just put everything I earn into bitcoin immediately as i earn it. In the growth market we have had this year , I always see an increase in the spending value of my money before i need to spend it. Consequently, i always have small amounts left over which adds to my balance over all.
I am only up to a little over 0.17 bitcoin and my plan is to eventually reach 1 full bitcoin.
I am all in, in this way as i believe in the technology and the idea of not spending their money. If it goes to zero, i still wont cash out as the dust i collect is already extra money.
I recommend trying this way of living. It is liberating for me as i haven't used a bank account in months.   Just put all of your pay into your bitcoin wallet and only trade back to fiat when you need it

They are incensed that the HODLers won't give up their coins.
They recognize hard money when they see it and they see it in bitcoin, but they are very late to the party and so are printing more fake dollars out of thin air to but HODLed bitcoin with. It ain't working.
The creation of the crippleoff coin is simply an attempt to get more bitcoin in exchange for their even more fake than fiat centralized digital token. That worked a little bit - they picked up some coin there.
But .....
The vast majority of bitcoin are HODLed. There's only about 700,000 bitcoin available for fiat exchange plus some of the 1600 mined per day.
This really pisses them off.
So now, they buy the exchanges, they rehypothecate bitcoin, noticing that most people leave them on the exchange, creating fake bitcoin out of thin air. This imbalances the actual supply-demand equation and causes downward price pressure.
It still ain't working.
The HODLed coins are still HODLed.
The attacks will continue.
For now, spread the word about proof of keys day on jan 3rd. Pull all your BTC off of exchanges well before then.

In a top down administered corp coin these things can quickly be directed by the corporate board, who send down a directive to your dev team of one, who is beholden to the corporate 'road map' and dead lines and they then cut and paste what they need to from the Bitcoin open source project. 
True collaborative open source development is a lot messier and takes time, but it is where the true developments - like Schnorr take place. 
Thousands of collaborators on the open source Bitcoin project with their eyes on the code developments in a consensus driven fashion is simply messier slower, but better long term than the corporate model.
For consumer oriented mindset individuals such as yourself, corporate direction gives you that illusory quick fix you desire and the false corporate narratives that you repeat to each other give you a sense of security, but alas, it's just the usual top down corporate/consumer model.

I think you are missing the point about HODLing.
If they 'sell to fiat', they are holders of Bitcoin. HODLers NEVER sell back to fiat - EVER.
We HODL for the day that bitcoin is ubiquitous and you pay for services, goods and labour in it.
The early HODLers are intelligent people who bought bitcoin for the dream of a future without endless fake wars and unbridled corporate/government surveillance - not to get rich in fiat.
If it all works out, A new world will be built by these HOLDers. They are miles ahead in compassion and intelligence compared to the current dumbed down, corrupted and privileged powers that be.
This narrative that the HODLed Bitcoin should be 'spread around fairly' is silly. The vast majority of people who've joined this space in the last year, did so thinking they'd get rich by the price increase of a digital asset. That was a lie to begin with. And they'll sell for fake fiat on exchanges to banksters who have unlimited access to the fake fiat.
This will only put more bitcoin under bankster control, which we need to limit.
Bitcoin is NOT an investment, it is however, the first real tool humanity has ever had to switch the balance of power from the guy with the biggest stick and the least integrity over to the guys with integrity, intelligence and desire to build a world not based on corporate plunder.
That only the freshly mined coins and about 700,000 Bitcoin are in the fiat liquidity pool is good. The rest are HODLed and will NEVER be sold to fiat.
NEVER spend bitcoin on exchange, only buy. NEVER spend bitcoin with someone who will sell on exchange.
Spend it with each other, demand payment in it, stop using fiat all together.
Screw the incumbents, they've let is all down, they deserve to be dethroned.

As much as I believe that you believe the whole $50 fee narrative repeated ad nauseum by the bcash corp shill machine, I have found it to be completely false.
Even during the spam attacks, I never paid more than $2.50 and had only one transaction (with a 7 cent fee) stuck for 10 days.
My average fee over the last 6 years is still under 1 cent. And now that most of my transactions are through LN, that average fee will plummet well below that over the next year or 2.
I recommend you try a few transactions instead of just repeating corporate narratives that are designed to trick people disingenuously.
You might be surprised to find that your beliefs are simply erroneous.
Anyway, I'm always curious which boss you bcashers ended up choosing when they had their little corporate temper tantrums. Did you side with Jihan and Roger or Faketoshi and Calvin?

No, you are naive in your limited Umercan world view that everyone buys bitcoin as an 'investment'. That's the idea put into you by your bankster media and YOU sucked it up.
However, there's a big world out here and we are not buying bitcoin, rather we are selling our fiat while dumb fools will still accept it in return for bitcoin.
Globally (outside of Umerca) people sell their fiat for bitcoin as an 'investment' in a possible future free of Umercan Imperialism, endless fake wars, oppression and mass surveillance.  We are in this for the bloodless solent revolution that Bitcoin actually is, while you idiots think it is a 'digital asset' that gets bought/sold/valued in fiat terms.
Thinking the whole world is as dumbed down as Umerca is the epitome of naive.

XRP, AKA the great cripploff, is not even a 'crypto currency'. 
It's main use case is for bankers to tokenize the fake fiat they have the power to create with ZERO effort into a fake 'crypto' that they also can create out of nothing with ZERO effort to trade for real hard money Bitcoin, thereby taking the real money off of greedy FOMOers who happen to have some BTC.
@_date: 2018-12-17 10:17:06
If you are purchasing on every exchange maybe, but there are other purchasers. Believe me. I have a friend who recently needed to move 4 million dollars out of a jurisdiction into another. It took us a very long time to acquire that much BTC. It can't be done at once, there's not enough supply.
@_date: 2018-12-22 11:22:27
It is also 'illegal' to make your own decisions what you put into your body or not. It used to be illegal in Germany to be Jewish, in some middle east countries, it still is.

@_date: 2018-12-12 09:09:35
It's all fake. The 'supply' traded on exchanges is waaaaay more than what is actually on the exchanges.
They call it rehypothefication.  Which means selling stuff that doesn't exist.
So the 1,800 bitcoin per day being sold by miners gets blown to 20,000 bitcoin being 'sold' on exchanges.
The rest of those coins don't exist.
Pull your coins off of the exchanges while you still can.
There is a run on exchanges being organized for 3 jan.
Get in early.
@_date: 2018-12-19 16:31:38
Yes and no.
You'll find that many many of us have exited the legacy system already.
You spend and replace.
So if I have say 0.13 BTC, I try to always keep my balance at that or above. If It costs me 28,000 satoshi to buy a dollar, I make sure I replace those satoshi or more by selling more fiat.

There's nothing accurate about it at all.
Basically the article says that the fiat dollar price as quoted on exchanges will change, either up or down.
Hmmmm....    Really now ?!?!?!?
Not a single mention of exchanges rehypothecating bitcoin to increase the supply with fake coins and how that dilutes the market, gives an artificially low price, while the banksters actually move the cheap bitcoin they are scooping up off of exchanges.
THAT is the current state if bitcoin - massive bankster attack convincing people to take their easy fiat money that costs them nothing for real money, hard money - Bitcoin.

Wall st would be very very lucky if they have 200,000 bitcoin combined. You are overestimating wall street's power. 
They have the privileged power to create fake fiat out of thin air, which they are swapping for bitcoin as quickly as they can.
There's very little bitcoin available for fiat sale. Only about 700,000 in total. The other 14 odd million are HODLed and will NEVER be sold for fiat.
The quickest way they've found to get a hold of bitcoin is the crippleoff scam. Get people to give you the hard money Bitcoin in exchange for an even-faker-than-fiat 'digital token' cripple XRP
That's how they managed to get the bitcoin they have.
The billionaires will never be able to transfer their fiat bank holdings to bitcoin in entirety before it loses it's value, there simply won't be enough bitcoin available for sale.

What you call capitalism is corporatism - the same method Hitler used by the way.
We have never had free market capitalism, the invisible hand is far too busy 'fixing things'.
We've also never had socialism or communism or marxism. The eastern block countries that we thibk were such were in fact fascist states.
Corporatism parades under the guise of capitalism, but nothing could be further from capitalism. One set of rules for corporations, another set for the rest of us.
Corporatism leads to very nasty things, like endless fake wars, handouts for businesses that deserve to go under, two party system where both sides are on the same side (the corporate one), mass surveillance, terrible products, stifling creativity, fake news, a super class, lots of poverty and debt slavery, pollution, global climate change, oppression, murder, theft .....

You are missing the point. 
The exchanges have created fake bitcoin that exist only on the exchange, not on the mined ledger. This fake supply of bitcoin affects the supply/demand equation and is unethical.
We need to remind them who bitcoin belongs to - not to them.
The banksters control the fiat exchanges, they have done this to decrease the price, hopefully destroying Bitcoin. They are privileged dumbed down fools who are starting to feel the silent revolution that IS Bitcoin and they are very very concerned.
As a trader, if you want the exchange 'price' of bitcoin to reflect the actual supply/demand situation, you aught to support this initiative.
Don't be the guy who gets the message from your exchange that they've placed 'withdrawal limits'.

You are dreaming.
The persian empire hasn't been successful for a thousand years because they are silly. They know how to deal with dumbed down Umerca.
Bitcoin swept through Iran in 2012. People bought it to HODL, not because of it's possible increase in fiat value, but because it was taking a punt with a few bucks on a possible future where their grand children don't need to fear US bombs and drone strikes.
They are waaaay more loaded on bitcoin in the general population than Umercans, who think it is an investment to increase fiat wealth. These people will never buy fiat with their btc. That wealth has exited the system.

The next step is to bring the 'exchanges' into line. They are controlled by banksters, they realize most people don't take their BTC off of the exchange. So they've artificially created waaay more bitcoin that exist only on their exchange than what the users actually deposited with them.
This artificial supply (maybe more than 10X actual supply) vs the demand affects the price, as we've seen.

It's because all the 'traders' or 'investors' are dumbed down media-led fools who leave their bitcoin on the exchanges. The banksters control the exchanges now.
These bankster exchanges saw that the stupid gullible 'traders' don't take possession of their bitcoin, so they rehypothecate the bitcoin and create 'bitcoin' out of thin air that exist only on the exchange.
Supply and demand affects price, so as the exchanges create artificial supply (possible by up to 10X), the price is affected.
You can be assured that THEY move their bitcoin. They are money heads - they know hard money when they see it. 
It is the 'investors' that will get burnt. HODLers will be fine.

I think the user you are going back and forth with has that corporate bcash mindset where they just prefer having SOMEONE IN CHARGE. They are the crypto users who just can't fit the idea of open source collaboration into their brains and prefer the top down directed model, where dev is directed based on a 'road map' to appeal to consumers.
That inability or unwillingness to comprehend how an open source project functions in a systemic sense, makes it easy for them to believe the corporate narrative that somehow blockstream 'has control' of development and 'intentionally crippled' Bitcoin and bla bla bla. 
Gullible yes, for sure. But I think it is deeper. They simply don't get how it functions.

You send 10 bitcoins to an exchange. They create up to 30 times that many to be available for 'trading' on the exchange. These coins do not exist on the mined ledger, only on the exchange. This is possible because so many people are using the exchanges to store their bitcoin, still being in the legacy financial system mindset of bank accounts.
If we all withdraw our btc, they will not have enough to send to all the users that claim them and tge whole workd will finally understand that this is a war, not an 'investment'.

You and I have watched the world change considerably.
Many of those changes are the result of us having let the school yard bully take the helm.
You know it, I know it - it is our responsibility to alert the young ones to the fraud that they have been born into.
Bitcoin is a silent revolution to remove the power that this criminal element seized from us decades ago.
It is NOT an 'investment'. The fiat price matters little.
It is the silent revolution whereby those that get it, on a monthly basis, sell their spare fiat (because it is fraudulently created by crooks) and acquire bitcoin and most importantly spread the word.  Spread the word to sell a hundred fiat bucks a month and store it in bitcoin as part of a growing movement to disempower the criminals.

@_date: 2018-12-18 09:39:20
For starters don't 'invest'.
Bitcoin is the bloodless silent revolution the world has been waiting for to end the imperialism, mass surveillance and fake wars that the legacy financial system requires to keep going.
It is not an investment to increase your dollar value. It is a way to sell your dollars and exit the fraudulent system because you no longer wish to take part.
It is a global worldwide movement.
Umerca is waaaaay behind. Your bankster lamestream media overlords have all the AmeriCAN'Ts believing it is some kind of 'digital asset' that gets bought/sold/valued in fiat terms as an 'investment'.
This narrative (that Umerca swallowed hook line and sinker) has held your country back in the revolution, to try to destroy it, sideline the revolution or just buy time to be able to acquire it themselves before YOU, the people do.
Invest in time to study. Watch every VDO on Anthony Antonopolous' youtube channel. Read "bitcoin standard".
Stay away from this sub. It's full of the brain dead, gov and bankster shills, 'investor' types etc.  It is too Americo-centric with virtually everyone believing and repeating lines fed to them by their media overlords.
Bitcoin is global. Really try to understand what that means.
Every country on the planet has something to gain by bitcoin replacing the dollar as the reserve currency of the world - except Umerca. Be aware of THAT.
Only spend money you can afford to lose and sell your fiat for the right reasons - the potential of entering an era of never before seen peace and prosperity world wide.
This has very little to do with money as you now know it.
Keep possesion of your own bitcoin. DO NOT leave it on exchanges, Cost Dollar Average and HODL. Don't try to time the market, you'll get burned. Just sell your fiat and NEVER change those Bitcoin back to fiat again at ANY price. Rather wait for the day that you can spend bitcoin to buy resources, labour and energy and help us build a world healthy for children and other living things !!!!

It doesn't.
It is the only bossless currency in the history of the world.
EVERY other currency (crypto AND fiat) lags behind bitcoin in this respect.
Because of this, bitcoin has proven technological superiority and all other alts lag behind in this vital part of technical advancement.
All other technological advancement (all unproven in the wild, at scale), are irrelevant without the technical superiority of bitcoin's bosslessness.
People globally are interested in bitcoin not for it's lead in some kind of coding technology, but that it has rewritten expectations of what a currency could be - the bosslessess.

That is inevitable for one reason - because they don't have enough actual bitcoin to send out Because of their fake paper bitcoin.
Bitcoin is digital money. It's not like someone is handling each transaction. Whether the exchange has to send btc to one customer or a million, it happens through code, so it doesn't 'take longer' on the exchange side. Also, through batching, many many payments can be fit into one transaction.

Remember, the problem with segwit 2X had nothing to do with big blocks or small blocks. The community rejected it because it handed the development of the client off to a bunch of corporate suits - the same ones who then forked to create bcash because the just had to be in control. Cry babies.

The main cause of the downward pressure is caused by the artificial supply created by exchanges rehypothecating Bitcoin.
Supply and demand determines the price.
Right now people are 'trading' hypothecated (read fake) bitcoin on exchanges.
This artificial 'supply' of bitcoins in effect IS part of the 'supply'. 
Overblown supply vs demand creates a fake price.

It is possible that poster sells his fiat and  is a bitcoin HODLer and will NEVER exchange back to fiat. Maybe he/she really gets it and cashes their fiat fake money out to btc.

Don't listen to the 'traders' who answered you. They are clueless and trying to increase their fake fiat wealth. Brain dead.
Bitcoin is a bloodless silent revolution operating globally (Umerca being insignificant because it's soooo far behind, still caught in the fiat trading mindset) which, if we win, removes the power of a select few (about 8,000 people who directly benefit from the fraud) to create 'money' out of thin air to fund endless fake wars, oppression, theft of resources and mass surveillance.
Outside of Umerca people are selling their fiat in the hope that their children don't live in a dystopic world, 'investing' in the end of Umercan imperialism and putting their money where their mouth is in being part of an attempt at a peaceful future - an era of peace and prosperity.
As we have picked the biggest and most ruthless, most powerful enemy, Bitcoin is ALWAYS under attack.
The current method employed by the banksters is creating fake bitcoin on exchanges via rehypothefication. WE, the users need to remind them that this is OUR money, not theirs.
Consequently, a campaign is being run to make the bankster exchanges pull their heads in. We do this by removing our bitcoin (and fiat) off of exchanges for the 10 year anniversary of the genesis block on jan 3rd. We'll see if they can send the bitcoin the users of their exchanges believe they have on the exchange to the users.
Chances are they will send out a message 'informing' their users that they are implementing BTC withdrawal restrictions. That will be first. 
Don't be one of those users and spread the word.
Get your BTC off the exchange.
This campaign is being called 'proof of keys'.
The traders are resisting, but they don't matter.

No. 
That's a lie spread by the corporate interests who tried to take the project from the open source core system to a corporate controlled one in the Hong Kong and New York 'agreements' that the user base rejected in the UASF.
There is no truth in this lie.
Those corporations then forked to bcash, another failed experiment in corporate control of cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin is and will remain bossless.
In fact the first bossless currency in the history of mankind. It is why the world is enamoured with it.

Something like that, bit it could be argued that it's just business. 
Bcash corp is consumer oriented, trying to make the brain dead, who aren't yet mentally equipt to understand collaborative open source protocol development, happy with a product that has a road map and deadlines, where the 'developers' are beholden to corporate directives.
It is a corporate attempt to fool noobs into a corp coin chain as if it were permissionless.
That is just doing business in the eyes of Sain Bits LLC.
Unfortunately for them, but great for humanity, it failed miserably and spectacularly for the whole world to see.
Open source development driven by consensus beats the old 'debate, decide and direct' corporate systems hands down.

The exchanges are rehypothecating coins to artificially increase supply. This creates an artificial 'price'.
We are under attack folks.
Just keep buying the cheap coins and pulling them off of exchanges.
Do it while you can.

Think it through.
The exchanges are fractionally creating bitcoin out of thin air based on deposits users have made to them, so maybe they only have 100 bitcoins, but 3,000 are 'held by users' on their accounts with the bank, er, exchange.
That 30X increase in apparent supply affects the demand/supply equation, which affects the fiat 'price'.....  Maybe by a factor of 10 to 30 times.
Would you like to see the math correct itself to actual supply, thereby affecting the price upwards, maybe by 10 to 30 fold ????

Bitcoin is special for many reasons, but the most compelling one for people outside of Umerca is that it is the world's first and only bossless currency.
While AmeriCAN'Ts appear to be more than happy to switch the old boss for the new boss, being kept very docile and complacent, the rest of the planet would be extremely wary of replacing the existing boss (banksters) with a new boss.
The main reason the whole planet is enamoured by bitcoin and ignores proprietary coins like bcash and cripploff/stellar is that it IS bossless.
At the end of the day, people want to take part in trade if goods and services. They are well turned on by this idea of a transparent bossless medium of exchange that benefits no one set of permissioned elites and we can all trust to be neutral.

Have a look at the pathetic volumes on all exchanges add it all up. Even ignoring the fact that a 30,000 btc volume in 24 hours probably includes the same coin bought and sold multiple times, worldwide, less than 100,000 coins are traded daily. That's only 3 million per month.
Add to that the data on wallets that haven't moved, or move rarely and it makes the number even smaller.
Put 2 and 2 together, multiply by 10 to give the Benefit of the doubt in case our numbers are off by an order of magnitude and you get 700,000.

Yes. It will work that way. You could actually have a clone of that same mycelium wallet as a bread wallet, even on the same device. In fact, before you erase your mycelium wallet (which is a great wallet by the way), download bread and when it asks you whether to load existing wallet or generate a new one, select load existing and put your 12 word seed. You'll see it populate with your coins. Then you already have them in bread and if you like you can erase your mycelium wallet. 
There are some good guides at the top of r/bitcoin threads, I recommend reading those and understanding before taking my word for it :)

What none of the 'investor' types in this thread realize is that bitcoin will always be under attack - by the small privileged few (about 8,000 people) who directly benefit from that fiat creation fraud.
They print that crap out of thin air and buy bitcoins with it. It costs them nothing at all. They don't value the easy money fiat they are privy to creating, they value the hard money BTC. 
Yet the 'investors' are too stupid to realize this and value the fake fiat more than the hard money BTC.

But.....   Bitcoin is global.
And you can rest assured the rest of the planet is interested in Bitcoin because it is bossless, because it has no blond haired blue eyed liar behind it.
Umerca is waaaaay behind in the silent revolution because you fools actually believe the bankster narrative that bitcoin is some kind of digital asset that gets bought/sold/valued in fake fiat dollars.  The ignorance and lack of cognitive ability of all the AmeriCAN'Ts completely drowns out the voice of the handful of AmeriCANs.

You mean you are holding for next 2-3 years. You hold, then you sell. HODL means something different.
HODL is when your mind has escaped the matrix and you no longer value the fiat that a small privileged group prints out of thin air (and is currently swapping for hard money bitcoin).
Where a dollar costs you 30,000 satoshi and you sell your fiat to store your liquid wealth in hard money.
HODL means NEVER sell to fiat at ANY price, but rather sell your fiat and accumulate Bitcoin to be used when bitcoin is ubiquitous and you can pay for resources, labour and time with it to build a new world devoid of endless wars and mass surveillance.

Nice narrative you got on repeat there, but wrong guy son. 
I make hundreds of transactions a month, have been all in for years. Like most early adopters, still using Bitcoin. Works just fine as peer2 peer electronic cash system just as the title of the white paper suggests. (You aught to read the rest of it some time.)
It's just now my hundreds of on chain transactions have become less than 20, because the majority are packed into the few transactions I made a few months ago to open a few LN channels. 
But hey, I guess your corporate narrative only works if you don't actually transact, but rather waste your time repeating the same tired false narratives about the 'intentionally crippled' base layer, comedy gold, core minions and whatnot. (Very well worn narratives, all of them - got anything new?)
Should try transacting some time, you know, using it as a currency.  It's a great place to be. Works awesome.

Essentially Bitcoin is a revolution of consciousness. The non-violent silent revolution in the worldwide struggle taking place between people and corporations - especially banksters.

Nice false narrative 'direction dev team decides to take'
This isn't some corp coin like bcash.
It is done by consensus - the whole point of the experiment.
I recommend studying up a bit on both how consensus is achieved as well as some research into the brilliance of the systemic process designed by linus torvalds in developing GIT and open source development methodology.
In short, there is no 'dev team' in CHARGE. You are projecting onto this revolutionary new way of collaboration our well known top down systems of how the world has always functioned. 
It is simply not possible in a systemic sense to have a 'dev team' in control. The process of collaborative open source development may seem messy looking at it from the hierarchical mindset we are born into, but it cannot be gamed by any one person or group. It does not grow through 'debate' or directives or even 'road maps'. It is far more organic.
If you have any qualms with 'the direction', join the github core development process and DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
If you really want SOMEONE IN CHARGE, that you can influence by money, power or debate, look into bcash corp coin project, appeal to the overlords, make enough noise and the corporation might consider your needs in refining their product, giving you the road map and convenience you as their consumer desire.
@_date: 2019-05-06 08:08:09
You need to decide if you are an 'investor' trying to get gains in fiat value or if you are in this for the silent bloodless revolution potentially ushering in an age void of fake war, fake news, fake music, fake people and fake security through mass surveillance.
In my opinion, you already cashed out when you dumped the blood soaked fiat for true hard money -BTC.
As a traded, put a stop loss on your trading account at a point where you still have significant 'gains' in fiat value, in case the price does drop.
If you are in it for the revolution, spend and replace. As in, spend your currency, but then immediately buy it back with fiat to keep your Satoshi balance the same or more over time.

ALL other 'cryptocurrencies' are boss coins. There is nothing special about that. It is great for them to exist, because we have btc. Without btc out in the wild, every single boss coin would be shut down due to their centralized failure point.
As much as Umercans have been well trained to trust corporations and are happy to switch an old boss (banksters) for a new boss (alt coin 'team'), EVERY other nation on earth is only interested in Bitcoin because you can exit completely from the boss paradigm - for the first time in history.
No one globally outside of Umerca will be interested in a boss coin while the bossless one is here.

Careful. You don't know where commenter is from. Reddit is extremely americo-centric and probably upwards of 99% of reddit accounts are Umercan, but Bitcoin is global.
And although the 'crash' seems so bad to all you Umercan 'investors', bitcoin isn't about you.
Bitcoin is a silent revolution of consciousness eating away at the grip that the bankster overlords have on your minds like a cancer.
For many people outside of Umerca (where most bitcoiners are) Bitcoin has real utility.
@_date: 2018-12-22 10:54:38
Many many people worldwide use BTC for earning and payments. Me personally, my tent, my groceries, beer, green fees, lawn mower and beer.
I buy dollars every so often, but they are costing over 20,000 satoshi at the moment, so trying not to.
Don't kid yourself into the bankster lame stream media narrative that BTC is not being adopted. Maybe in Umerca where people are sooooo dumbed down and believe bitcoin is an 'asset' that you 'invest' in, but remember, Bitcoin is global and out here in the real world away from dumbed down corporate run, nanny state Umerca, we use it. 
First comes HODL, then spend and replace, then demand payment in it.

Bitcoin is a revolution of consciousness. It will be attacked in ever manner possible. If it weren't a real threat to the legacy financial system, they'd be ignoring it, yet they can't shut up about it.
The powers that be are terrified of it.
It's Working out exactly as expected.
@_date: 2018-12-16 08:40:48
You've completely missed the point of bitcoin.  But then again, you are probably a 'trader' or 'investor' who bought the Umercan lame stream media line that bitcoin is some kind of 'digital asset' that gets bought/sold/valued in created out of thin air fake fiat dollars.
The gullibility and ignorance of the average Umercan has been well understood globally, so no one is surprised that so many of you fell for this. It has put Umerca waaay behind in the silent bitcoin revolution.

Remember, they will never be able to transfer their billions over with only 700,000 bitcoin available for fiat exchange.

This is the very reason for the current 'proof of keys' campaign - to shake out the paper bitcoin on exchanges.
Let's say all the exchanges combined have created paper bitcoins by 10X, would that explain the ridiculously low 'price' that NO ONE seems to be prepared to 'sell' at?
Before jan 3rd - proof of keys day - make sure you move all of your btc (and fiat) off of the exchanges.

We call it bcash for the same reason you are contacting gooooooogle about their predictably nefarious bending of truth.
Because bitcoin cash is confusing to new comers. Bcash is what everyone on the planet calls it beside a few hundred brain dead Umercans on r/btc precisely because it helps avoid confusion.
@_date: 2018-12-08 08:14:03
There is not that much bitcoin even available at any one time, there's less than 700,000 Bitcoin available in the fiat to bitcoin thing. The rest are HODLed, never to be traded for fiat. so it would push the price up because supply would decrease.
@_date: 2018-12-17 06:13:04
There's only about 700,000 mined BTC available in the fiat exchange cycle anyway. This is the only 'liquidity' that 'investors' have.
The rest are HODLed by real people who invested in a possible future without endless fake wars and mass surveillance made possible only by THEIR gip on the money creation racket.

Yes and no.
It's an open source project, so it has been useable for a year for geeks, useable fir enthusiasts for about 7 months and useable for those that need the utility of it and don't mind int's 'incompleteness' for about 4 months.
Unlike corporate development, which is 'ready to ship' by a certain date based on directives passed down from the board where the developers are beholden to deadlines and 'roadmaps', BTC and LN are open source, so yes it is ready and no, it is not ready.
I've been making hundreds of transactions a month in bitcoin for years now.
I find it fascinating that over the last 4 months, more than 300 transactions show up as 4 channel openings. Screw mixers, this IS privacy solved. All those transactions previously took up blockchain space.
So, in short, if you are ready to, jump in and have a play. It'll be a while before it is truly merchants ready and you'll see LN everywhere. Maybe 18 months ;)

However, there's a big planet out here and the world's population is turning onto the silent, bloodless bitcoin revolution very quickly BECAUSE they are tired of the US dollar reserve currency model, which runs on constant fake wars, oppression and mass surveillance.
See how happy you are with fiat when your country is NOT the world's reserve currency.

Wrong. Most bitcoin is HODLed by people who are in this for the long game - to bring down the banksters.

In 1997, one man - George Soros crashed the SEAsian economy affecting more people than the population of Umerca by an order of magnitude.
Those currencies were not reliable for real world use, but they were used.
That level of manipulation by a permissioned elitist criminal will not be possible in Bitcoin WHEN Bitcoin has that kind of scale - as in it is used daily by billions of people.
The point is, there are 8,000 people who get direct benefit from the legacy financial system fraud taking place, who control more than 99.9% of the world's wealth. They are privileged because their grand parents and great grand parents were involved with killing the right people to end up with all the loot.
Bitcoin is already more distributed and it's distribution is with people who sold their fiat for the right reasons. They vashed their fiat out to Bitcoin.
Bitcoin cannot be tampered with by a select few, who can just create it out of thin air.

No one who has ever bought bitcoin has had 'losses' unless they were dumbed down trader or 'investor' types who bought fiat back with their hard currency bitcoin, which is always a dumb thing to do.

You are assuming there will be 1,000 bitcoin available to buy for each client. 
Good luck with that one.
There's only about 700,000 bitcoin available for fiat purchase plus the 1,600 mined per day (which most miners aren't selling right now).
The vast majority of bitcoin are HODLed, NEVER to be exchanged for fiat.
Your 'wealth managers' should stick to stuff they know about. They are waaaay to dumbed down to understand bitcoin's silent revolution.

You'll have to wait the usual 6 confirmations, so not instant, but the fastest you'll get sending to an exchange. Bitcoin is secure, so the fastest when sending to an exchange.
Exchanges need heaps of confirmations from the insecure alt coins, for example when sending either of the bcash forks, you'll be waiting hours if not days getting them recognized by the exchange because they are dwindling insecure chains that have no users or use cases.

It's not an investment. 
That's just the narrative you've been sold.
It is the silent revolution where, by each of us putting $100 in bitcoin, to trade with each other (in the future), we strip the privilege of printing money out of thin air by the select few away from them.

Demand payment in it. Don't move a muscle unless they do.
Ask every single person who needs money from you to take bitcoin. With the hype surrounding it, you'll find almost everyone wants bitcoin, but has not been able to take the time to work it out and imagines it as a complicated process, like getting a stock, forex account or credit card permission.
Once you show them that it is as easy as downloading an app and writing down some words to become a bitcoin owner, they are usually surprised at the ease and frictionlessness of it.
I don't even bother explaining the nightmare of selling their fiat for it. I explain that as a merchant they are in the ideal situation to accumulate bitcoin savings without screwing around 'buying it as an investment'.
Just teach them how to accept it and let their payers work out the fiat legacy hoop jumping headache.

You sound like an 'investor', hoping to increase your 'wealth' in fiat terms. 
You'll always get burned.
HODLers are more like collectors. We buy Bitcoin and NEVER sell it in exchange for fiat. Then we watch the fireworks as people slowly start to realize that this is actual 'hard money' - and the shenanigans that ensue. And we collect more when it is cheap in fiat.
Then we value things differently. You see, to many of us, a dollar was costing us about 15,000 satoshi all year long. Now one of em is 30,000 satoshi. Right NOW, It's a good time to restock on satoshi.

HODLers are always ok. 
We bought to be part of the bloodless, silent revolution that IS bitcoin and is already scaring the shit out of your beloved bankster overlords.

Please remember that Bitcoin is global.
Indeed, Conbase has a grip on the Umercan bitcoin scene, having all the ameriCA'Ts believing that bitcoin is some kind of 'digital asset' to be bought/sold/valued in US dollars on centralized exchanges.
But Umerca is waaaaaay behind and conbase is insignificant in the global bitcoin scene.
There's a lot of people out here, and they see bitcoin as a way out from under the thumb of the Umercan empire. The dream of a world without endless fake wars and government/corporate mass surveillance.

I think he's alluding to the idea the bitcoin, although it goes up in price when valued in dollar terms, it actually is NOT an investment. 
Bitcoin is the world's first and ONLY bossless medium of exchange in history. It is a silent bloodless revolution.
Those who understand this and sell the fiat dollars that they can afford to lose to cash out into Bitcoin, invariably end up with increased stored, liquid wealth when measured in fiat value. Big deal !!! 
The whole point is that if you get what bitcoin is about, you sell your fiat, never to return.

This is bitcoin. It is not a stock or an investment. People don't 'dump'.
The tiny amount of bitcoin in fiat trading (less than 700,000 btc) determines the fiat 'price', but the vast majority of bitcoin is HODLed and NO fiat price is good enough to sell or 'dump'.
I love the term the brain dead traders use: cash out. 
Cash out to what ?!?!? Fake fiat that a select privileged few can print willy nilly as they wish ?!?!?
How does that make any sense. Traders and 'crypto investors' are insanely stupid.
HODLers cash out of fiat into hard money Bitcoin - the world's first bossless currency.

It starts with HODL. Learning to understand that we don't buy bitcoin, rather we sell our fiat to prepare to exit the system.
Then comes spend and replace. Spend your bitcoin, filling new wallets for people you do business with. Showing them how easy it is - just download an app, write down some words, put them in a secure place, send them the payment and BINGO!! They are a bitcoiner. As a merchant They will realize that they need not jump through hoops to get permissioned, they need not deal with the headache of bankster KYC-scam exchanges, they can let their customers work out how to do that.
Remember the replace part. Always increase your satoshis or at least keep the balance steady.

If prices were adjusted for dollars the graphs would be very strange indeed. Dollars are irrelevant outside of Umerca. 
The Metrics they are using - local currency and btc paint an accurate picture showing the inflation of their currency compared to btc.

With their currency.

My good buddy got burned like that when he set buy at $780ish (I think) and it went back over $1,000 never to return. This is not financial advice, but it is time to decide whether the fiat is more important to you or acquiring Bitcoin.
It comes down to keeping your exposure level commensurate with your understanding of the tech and the global, bloodless, silent bitcoin revolution taking place and importantly, your disposable income. 
As you become comfortable with the tech and ok with financially storing less savings in a bank in fiat, your mind will make a paradigm shift as follows:
Everyone starts with The investor mindset: i have to buy btc low and sell high so I can increase my fiat holdings.
After learning about what you are really a very important part of, your mind switches to The HODLer mindset: 
I have to sell as many dollars for the most Satoshi as I can while you can get 5 figure satoshi for every dollar - right now a dollar will fetch you about 28,500 satoshi. The goal is to sell your fiat dollars and accumulate Satoshi.
Ultimately the 'Bitcoin price' when you sold your fiat is irrelevant.
The important metric is how many satoshi you have. Anywhere between 10 and a hundred million is a good amount to shoot for that most any Umercan could achieve in time by cost dollar averaging.
HODLers NEVER buy dollars unless they are spending and replacing. They NEVER 'cash out' to dollars. The cashing out  is from dollars to satoshi. It is a choice to exit a fraudulent system that directly benefits less than 8,000 people. 
The vast majority of Bitcoin is HODLed by people who are not in it for financial reasons, but more because they are taking part in the good fight. They can sleep well knowing they are part of humanity wielding the first tool it has ever had to pry off the shackles that have been binding us for so long.
If you invest your time into study instead of your fiat dollars 'buying bitcoin' at least until your mind can make the above paradigm shift, you'll be fine, with no anxiety about the current heavily manipulated 'price', the bad news the media is telling you, or anger at the banksters, governments and corporations.
It is worth being a HODLer just for the peace of mind at that point.
The good news, there's more and more of us every day.

Only about 700,000 Bitcoin available in the fiat markets. The banksters probably have less than 300,000 combined.

The easiest way is to 
1- download an app - a bitcoin wallet. Samourai for Android or green address for ios are good, but there are others.
2- follow the instructions and write down the seed words.
3- select receive in the wallet, copy the address.
4- click withdraw on your exchange, paste in the address from your mobile wallet (check it !!!) and send your 0.3BTC to your own wallet.
By the way, 0.3 BTC is already a very large amount. it's 30 million satoshi.
No one really needs more than 0.1 BTC to HODL

They are fake - or rehypotheficated - bitcoin.
The best thing we can all do, is to use bisq for trading and pull all bitcoin off of exchanges.
When we see conbase move 200,000 bitcoin, you can be sure those 200,000 bitcoin are showing as 2 million bitcoin on the exchange.

They have to coexist. The difference is that in time, bitcoin will be the standard by which fiat is valued.
So for example, right now people have been taught to think of bitcoin being valued in fiat dollars at roughly $3,500.
But for many of us, it costs us 28,500 Satoshi if we for some reason need to buy a dollar.
This will become normal. ALL currencies, which 'coexist' with bitcoin will become valued in satoshi.

Is it possible the massive drop in price is an illusion and a bit of reality is seeping back in ???
I know a few 'investor' types trying to make fiat profit on btc (as compared to HODLers). NONE of them are willing to sell for less than 10K.
Remember, the exchanges have created a massive artificial supply in creating paper bitcoins because users don't take their funds off of the exchanges.
Also remember, there are some pretty sophisticated bots trading with themselves to depress to price. The intention was to get HODLers to sell their BTC.
It didn't work.
A bunch of 'traders' or 'investor' types who really don't understand or care for the bloodless silent revolution that IS bitcoin, got burnt and sold, but those coins are part of the very small amount of BTC that is available for fiat purchase. And good riddance, really.
The vast majority are HODLed and that pisses the powers that be off.

If they are holding say 10,000 real bitcoin deposited with them by users, but after rehypothecating those coins to show as 100,000 coins showing on the exchange, and users decide to withdraw their coins, the exchange would be 90,000 coins short, so yes, I imagine the first thing they'd do is message all users that they changed their withdrawal policy.

No, it's bullshit. Bcash exists BECAUSE of the cry baby corporations which were blocked by the users in their 'NYA' and 'HKA' takeover attempt of bitcoin development.
Bcash got them, making it a boss coin controlled by corporate interests. And then they started squabbling, bcashers had to choose their boss and their silly hash war is still in action.
It was a bad experiment. Centralizing control over bitcoin failed - and THAT is a good thing.

Conbase is a corporation with a banking license. They have worked out that many users never remove their crypto from conbase, so they create fake paper 'crypto assets' out of thin air that exist only on the exchange, NOT on the ledger.
They are obsessed with maintaining and perpetuating this lame stream bankster narrative that crypto is an 'investment' which eventually gets 'cashed out' to fiat fakeness, which they are also 'licensed' to fractionally reserve.
God forbid you Umercans get with the program that the rest of the planet is on and realize BITCOIN is a revolution - a bloodless, silent revolution, where we take part by exiting THEIR fraudulent system and cash out our fiat dollars to actual hard money - BTC.

I'm not a lefty, but poster is correct. We've never seen communism on this planet. We've seen forced fascism call itself communism or socialism, but communism it is not.
We've also never seen a true free market, because the invisible hand is all pervasive. It too ends up being a form of fascism or the corporatism we have now.
Now talk about killing in the name of an economic system.
Yes, there were tremendous death rates in said 'communist or leftist' countries (which were in fact fascist countries), but the fake 'capitalism' we all worship now - corporatism - kills way more people than the other fascist systems.
I'm a hard core libertarian. I'm not for hand outs of any description, not for lazy people, not for banks, not for oil companies, not for big business, 'agricultural' business, none of it.
The problem with Umerca is that they are ok with hand outs - but only for incumbent elite corporations, not for people who might actually needs some help.

And we all know that the vast majority of bitcoin will NEVER be used to buy fiat.

I do find it a bit tragic that the AmeriCAN'Ts are so gullible and easily swayed by the narratives of their bankster media overlords.

The reason Bitcoin is a phenomena that the whole world is enamoured with is that it is the first medium of exchange in the history of the world that is bossless, it is not run by some privileged select few.
This is not Bitcoin's best 'selling point', rather is is bitcoin's very DNA.
Bitcoin is still the world's only bossless currency. ALL alt coins are boss coins. 
Also, the phenomena is global, so while adoption in Umerca is waaaaay behind, it doesn't really matter. This is something I've found - the Americo-centric world view expressed in virtually every single comment and post on this sub, blinds you people from understanding the idea that the world is a big place outside of your country and it has way more people than the US.

Bitcoin will be THE crypto for one reason only.
'First mover advantage' is a marketing concept for products. It is irrelevant when it comes to currency.
The ONLY reason people outside of Umerca  are becoming increasingly enamoured with Bitcoin is because it is the first and ONLY bossless medium of exchange in world history.
It can't be gamed by Umercan suits. End of story. 
ALL other crypto currencies are dependent on Bitcoin's very existence, because without Bitcoin out in the wild they wouldn't be tolerated by the powers that be for even 24 hours. They are ALL boss coins.
No one outside of Umerca is even marginally interested in swapping the old boss (banksters) for the new boss (latest crypto web site and slick 'team').
That being said, there's incredible creativity and development happening throughout the cryptocurrency space, which I believe is positive and there will be many winners.
But Bitcoin will always be the central decision layer determining the 'value' of ALL other currencies.

All the more reason to support this campaign. They hold your coins because they have up to 10 times less real bitcoin than the total customer holdings on the exchange. It's all fake bitcoin.

Is bcash still a thing? It seems there's 50 user names on the hijacked sub repeating lies to each other 24/7.

Just using the phrase 'conspiracy theories' makes you sound so ignorant !!!
It is the coincidence theorists that are blind.
What is the difference between an exchange moving some bitcoin, albeit a large amount and me sending my landlord $600?
A transaction is a transaction.
IF, and I mean IF, they have the same number of real bitcoin that they show and have not fractionally reserved (very very unlikely), there will be zero friction and zero time delay.
If there is friction, time delays etc., it's banks being banks.
This is programmable money. They should be able to process ALL withdraw requests from ALL customers simultaneously in seconds.

It is just a matter of perspective.
The interesting thing about open source collaborative development is that it happens before our very eyes. 
In corporate development 'products' are released when they are 'market ready'. 
An Open source developed system can seem to be difficult, nerdy and clunky, all problems transparently out in the open, until suddenly, seemingly, it just works and works better than anything that could ever come out of the top down directed corporate development environment.
For people viewing the world from a consumer mindset, hierarchically determined system, LN can seem soooo broken, until suddenly, seemingly, it isn't.
LN is not a product, it is a protocol in development and it's problems, very transparently and shamelessly laid bare, are being attended to daily, the whole protocol developing rapidly.
So yes, as much as LN can look like a failure in the making to the consumer oriented mind viewing the world in the old hierarchical top down sense, to those minds that have made the switch into the decentralized open source paradigm, it is simply the future being developed before our very eyes.

Your world view is undeniable and understandably Americo-centric. From your perspective I 100% agree with you.
But from a more globally encompassing perspective, which is very uncommon on reddit, hyperbitcoinization is an inevitability.

Haven't had any problems in 5 years. Do some study. Start with how open source software development works -or doesn't -until suddenly, it does.
Bitcoin is leaderless open source consensus driven. It has no team, no CEO, no marketing department, no adoption plan, no road map..... And yet it continues to capture the attention of people worldwide. Think about that.
It is the first fair, transparent and leaderless medium of exchange in history.
There's plenty of boss coins out there with massive budgets to push adoption, going no where. Bcash is a classic example. It's a corp coin. No one is interested in changing the old boss (banksters) with the new boss (latest better-than-bitcoin project's slick website and 'team').
They are only interested in sacking the old boss once and for all.
And remember, of the world's estimated 60 million bitcoin users -growing by a million a month, very few of them have even heard of reddit, let alone join in discussions about bitcoin.

Very interesting point. 
I'm not from Umerca, so the whole tax leveraging thing is kind of irrelevant and I haven't needed to understand it.
But from the little I do know, that strategy might work.
Thanks for the heads up. I learned something from you.

Circulation for sure. 
Available for fiat purchase, no.
We sell our fiat because it's fraudulently created. We exit the system because we finally can. We evangelize the bloodless silent Bitcoin revolution because we love our grand children.
We don't buy back fake blood soaked fiat !!!
That's for brain dead 'investors' and 'traders'.
HODLers who spend and replace only with people who NEVER sell to fiat, are sleeping well at night.
The sellouts ('investors') are anxious.

I find Europe easy for making bitcoin purchases. Seems everyone wants in there. They get the Umercan oppression thing.
@_date: 2018-12-16 08:50:51
You'll find that most people who did are still selling their fiat for it right now, so in the long run their average fiat selling price is higher and getting more satoshi.
@_date: 2018-12-18 04:28:52
It's not spam.
It is very important that this idea spreads and we bring those 3rd parties into line and pull their heads in.
No e if your 'reasons' are valid and your alternative is too soft for these corrupt bankster owned exchanges.
You are obviously ok with exchanges (who have banking licenses and are as such legally not liable for their own fractional reserve foolishness) diluting the actual supply with order of magnitude more bitcoin than they have on deposit.
The rest of us are NOT ok with that and these corporations need to be taught a harsh lesson.
They are banking licensed corporations, if the lesson is not harsh enough, they'll continue on with the same shenanigans.

Gooooooogle was always evil.
Core contributors will not be 'replaced', it is a fluid contributor led community, some will stop contributing, others will join etc.
Core will become bigger, as in more contributors and reviewers, but at some point, the job will be 'done' and there won't be much need for 'upgrades'.

Bitcoin is not an investment. 
This is where everyone on this thread has been led astray by the bankster lame stream media.
Bitcoin is a silent revolution to usurp the power from the banksters to create money out of thin air to fund fake wars and mass surveillance.
Nothing more, nothing less.
Globally, people are buying bitcoin for this reason alone. In that way it is the single best 'investment' anyone can make.
It is only Umerca that thinks it is about making more fake fiat.
While you fools 'buy bitcoin' the rest of us are selling fiat.
