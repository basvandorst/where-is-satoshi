Sorry, I mean I know what a micro SD card is, I just don’t know how money would be stored on it or accessed through it.

Ah, thank you! I don’t think anyone has mentioned that one yet. I will keep an eye out! It reminds of the 90’s when it was cool to make calculators and phones and whatnot out of clear plastic so you could see the insides.
@_date: 2019-08-23 00:41:48
I will try that! 
And yeah, a lot of money went out of our bank account into exchanges and my dad was able to open a few online wallets (??) with the info we had that my husband wrote down, but all of them are empty. I’m sorry if I’m using the terminology ridiculously- I hope this makes sense.

Thank you- I have been looking at this from the completely wrong direction. But learning how to do it myself makes the most basic of sense. 
Also, those people sound like the most boring of pirates. I bet they don’t even sing jaunty tunes while they do it.

Oh, that is a good idea! And thank you, I appreciate it.

Thank you! I would have had no idea what I was looking at if I had found one of those. He already has loads of other gadgets I am completely mystified by- that very well may be one.

I’m not, but I guess I can see how people would be suspicious. I’m just honestly ignorant.

I guess you’re right- I feel panicky because everything is awful and there was the big rush of preparing for the funeral, but if this takes the next year to figure out, it’s not going to hurt anything. 
He listed two or three different websites for wallets on the password list along with the mnemonics (Blockchain was one) as well as something on his home PC. My dad spent forever  figuring it out and looking into each one. He’s not exactly “tech savvy”, but he was determined and spent a month with me getting the rest of my finances sorted out. He probably spent three or four full work days... maybe more... along with my father-in-law trying to sort this out. I just already feel like such a burden, I’m hesitant to ask anyone else to help- especially if it’s going to be as involved as it was for my dad. 
My husband has a whole drawer full of memory/SD cards they I’m going to have to work my way through. Thankfully I’m getting an idea of what to look for from this.
@_date: 2019-08-23 01:27:42
I’m not even sure how to look for that, I’m afraid.
@_date: 2019-08-23 01:52:19
Oh, that’s hilarious. 
I don’t even get what about this doesn’t sound legitimate. Is it so hard to believe that someone could die without getting their partner up to speed on their investments?

Coroner hasn’t said yet. The funeral director told me it could take months to do blood tests and whatever else they decide to do. The not knowing is awful.

Thank you! This is a good start! Any ideas where I could start my research into bitcoin wallets and how they work? 
Man, this feels like I’m in the worst Nancy Drew book ever written.

He was so private, he only discussed things in vague terms. It doesn’t seem like any of his close friends or family knew details. My dad tried to help me but he could only get so far. I kind of have to rely on the Internet because it’s not like my public library has a big dusty book on it. I assume. Do you have any suggestions for where a newbie could start learning about this?
@_date: 2019-08-23 00:25:39
Nah, I get it. You all don’t know me and I could totally see how someone might do that. It is real, unfortunately for me and my kids,but how could you know for sure? I’m sorry your poor uncle went through that. That’s a hell of a betrayal.
@_date: 2019-08-23 00:38:28
Oh, that is a great idea! Thank you!
@_date: 2019-08-22 23:33:18
Oh, I’m pretty dumb, but I’m not that dumb. But honestly thank you because someone needed to say it.
@_date: 2019-08-22 23:51:18
Thank you! This is all super helpful!
@_date: 2019-08-23 01:55:36
Except he moved stuff around so much and I can’t tell where it ended up. My dad was looking into this for me (he spent days on it) and he couldn’t tell either.
