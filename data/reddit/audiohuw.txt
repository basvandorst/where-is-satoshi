Why is this a top post?  It's going to suck when this subreddit turns into an instagram of vague and anecdotal posts.

A little outdated and what I consider to be hopeful misinformation.  Bitcoin will never become a recognized currency because it goes against the currency system we have now.  Bank accounts and government-backed currency can be frozen, but this is impossible through Bitcoin.   Bitcoin would take away the government's power to pursue the wealth of criminals and terrorists among others.  Also, power is no longer a big issue because pretty much all GPU mining is pretty much obsolete now.  Unless you are running some FPGA's the new wave of ASICs will no longer require much power to run.

It's amusing how well BFL has some of its investors like you in the pocket.  It's like you don't know the owner was jailed an extradited for 25$ million mail fraud, and their release date has been pushed back for half a year.  You will be lucky to get your units by May.  I say this because your singles and jalapenos are at the very bottom of the priority list with the mini rig $30k investments out in front.  You take a Twitter pic and a non-descript image to be proof of 2 weeks shipping?  Please.  And that's if its not a scam.

I respectfully disagree.  The appreciation of btc since their first preorder has made them all millionaires already.  They are continuing to receive preorders everyday without any proof of a working chips hashing power.  They don't have to do anything and the money is still rolling in.

You are wrong, I ordered BFLs back in September 2012, I got my refund in Dec 2012 because I was tired of waiting.  They paid me back in the BTC equivalent of my order -- BTC had appreciated during that time.  Where did the rest of my BTC end up?  And don't delude yourself and say BFL changed the btc to cash, then cash back to BTC to pay for my refund.  You clearly have no experience with this, and are just holding onto your order like a fanboy.

Also, its funny.  Don't worry guys he's just a pension stealing VP of the company whose family is notorious for conning.  Seems legit.

If you're so sure, just bet all your coins on bitbet that bfl will ship by April first and get some free money.  But you won't, because they won't.

Wouldn't investing in anything be gambling by that definition?
