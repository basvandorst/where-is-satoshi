I think the fact he sent 10 btc to the BitcoinEater address proves he has more than enough coins to burn:

Why not place your bets on a true bitcoin sportsbook, one that doesn't convert your btc to dollars, euros, etc?
We have good odds for that match: 
@_date: 2015-12-10 20:39:55
thanks, we have - since 2013. Caisnobitco.in is now  with the launch of a new P2P game in mid 2015.

Happy for our buddy Micon, sucks to be out of 25k - but far better than serving time

For merchants, we moved to  a while back after repeated failures from BCI, and general incompetence and arrogance from their boy CEO Nick. Gotta tell you, Block.IO has been incredible!
@_date: 2015-06-06 18:49:13
How's that 30 MM raised and our favorite man-child CEO Nick doing?
@_date: 2015-12-24 14:18:10
why someone would use a fiat, offshore book, with bitcoin perplexes me... Use  - Established in 2013, and always processing bitcoin withdrawals ;)
@_date: 2014-07-14 19:19:28
You get your original bet ($100) back plus your winnings ($100). Math is hard, I know.
@_date: 2014-07-02 14:53:40
I'm very interested - will check it out later today, look out for a PM
@_date: 2014-07-02 14:47:57
down... sucks to rely on their API :(
@_date: 2014-10-16 00:33:32
When the game arrives, be sure to bet on the game, with bitcoin at

Always horrible for the bettor when the book / casino converts your BTC to fiat so you can place bets, it exposes players to GREAT volatility for something that's already risky (betting on 50/50 bets). [CasinoBitco.in]( doesn't convert your BTC to legacy money - all bets are in mBTC. When you win, you get paid out in BTC, not fiat! 
@_date: 2014-06-24 12:11:07
Yes, its run by CasinoBitco.in (they acquired them a few months back) which is listed publicly on Havelock Investments.

Free spots to earn Bitcoin still available! Https://
@_date: 2014-03-19 13:28:18
I agree it's tough to complain for an entire day of downtime when it's free. Let me say that I'd be the first merchant to pay for the service if it was reliable!

Ok - so say I want to put $100 worth of BTC on the cowboys game... with me so far? I put in my 0.16 BTC and place an even money bet (0.16 to win 0.32). In the time it takes the game to end, BTC / USD has now  jumped to $800 - and I win my bet so I'm totally stoked to be getting 0.32 back..buuuuuutt instead of getting 0.32 back, I'm only getting 0.25 back. That works for you? 
@_date: 2014-08-12 13:31:52
hey - shoot an e-mail over to support or PM me - I haven't received indication of any issue?
@_date: 2014-01-30 13:46:05
Cheers, and don't forget about the little guys like (us)  that built games, a sportsbook, and our business from the ground up! 
@_date: 2014-10-07 12:47:00
Hey nic - congrats! You can always use some of that money to ensure your API functions per your documentation
@_date: 2014-03-19 13:17:45
we're in the same boat... in fact, we are seeing that addresses created with the API are not properly forwarding funds to the main wallet, or triggering callback URIs (yet). Ticket opened
@_date: 2014-04-01 12:28:08
Likewise - we don't use coinbase, but have registered there in the past

Wow - Folks, do NOT trust any gambling site that hasn't been around (and solvent) for at least a year.. further, any site that converts your BTC to USD/EURO for use of gambling is just a recipe for the user to lose their funds.

Shameless plug -  is open for Bitcoin sports-betting, and will gladly take your wagers

 is the only Bitcoin Casino that has Provably Fair Casino games, and a Sportbook... if only we paid Danny for a shoutout, we'd be in the article.
@_date: 2014-09-11 00:19:12
..in a month (not year), 20M is damn impressive online, especially in the niche bitcoin market. We are a competitor of the OPs, trust me - we'd kill for that kind of volume in a month... they are doing a good job.

We will be adding provably fair video poker this week; however, peer to peer hold em is not on our immediate roadmap. But we can never say never!
@_date: 2014-04-19 16:31:15
Not really - he had actually met the TOS for the bonus rollovers, and the site refused to pay him out... If you actually read the thread you would have come to that realization.
@_date: 2014-05-10 19:46:19
We will literally pay for a reliable API service, blockchain.info just can't hang!
@_date: 2014-09-03 01:26:09
...and they have a sportsbook as well? 
@_date: 2014-06-03 19:51:27
Ha... Dooglus, we love you man
@_date: 2014-07-14 23:15:19
If the price of bitcoin fluctuates between the time you placed the bet, and the end of the event (highly likely) - you will potentially lose money as this book is converting your BTC to fiat, then converting your fiat back to BTC after the event is over. 
If you don't get that - no worries. Put all your BTC on 5dimes, place some bets - then wait a few weeks to get a check from them. Or play on a reputable BTC Sportsbetting site (there are others besides us), and bet with btc (solely - no conversion to fiat), and cashout via BTC instantly.

back then, yes - it eventually sorted itself out (caught up); however, today we are floating over 40 btc at the moment in limbo

Imagine a brick and mortar store using the BlockChain.info API and this issue occurs.  
Is it expected that the customer stand in line for hours while cashier is just waiting for the funds to get forwarded to the correct address, and the callback URI to be invoked? 
Granted it is Sunday - but their help and support page emphasizes they are a 24/7 support group. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 21:10:54
This has happened in the past, a bit more frequent a few months back. Best part - I had some good back and forth with their young CEO on twitter, u/niccary, but he soon blocked me on twitter after I let him know his own support team acknowledged the issue was on their side? Was never resolved - and it's rearing it's ugly head right now.  
@_date: 2015-01-18 22:02:09
50 confirmations, and not even an acknowledgement from BCI?

you guys should try bitcoin rush, we have a great peer to peer Faucet where you can earn 10,000 satoshi daily.

Regarding the linkage, I'm speaking directly to when we were removed from the "Odds" comparison table. 
Slandering us on reddit and bitcointalk is not the best way to get your 0.14 btc. Contact us at admin[at]bitcoinrush.io to sort this out
@_date: 2015-07-25 19:17:23
Hello, CBTC Support here! We've had several email exchanges with James on this matter, and given the hostility from James and his reluctance to be reasonable on the matter - we decided to no longer pay him as an affiliate, this was after he stopped linking to BitcoinRush. 
Full disclosure, the amount withheld from his account was  ~0.14 BTC. Over the life of his account - he was paid 5.2451 BTC without issue. 
@_date: 2015-07-25 19:19:01
Super Funny...
@_date: 2015-07-25 19:48:55
You're right - we'll attempt to work with James in different channels to rectify his situation.

@_date: 2015-09-12 11:13:02
Very much downhill... don't even get me started with their API
@_date: 2015-09-13 13:04:01
We've been using block.io --- We've been very happy with them! Very reliable, and fantastic support.
@_date: 2015-03-29 22:00:37
did not know that, thanks for the info!
@_date: 2015-03-29 19:53:49
btw... this practice is illegal, merchants can't demand a minimum amount for credit cards

CasinoBitco.in also has over 500 props to bet on, minimum bet 1 mbtc!

This outage also affects all merchants who leverage the BCI API... 
@_date: 2015-02-28 12:45:34
+1, gotta say, BCI gets less credible with each and every outage. No sign of any issues from their twitter, helpdesk, or anywhere.   
@_date: 2015-02-28 20:22:13
sure there are, anyone that uses the BCI API to run their business is a merchant. 
@_date: 2015-02-28 12:57:50
7 hours
@_date: 2015-02-28 12:59:06
we hit them up via the help desk, various twitter accounts and bitcointalk, but no response (7 hour outage... awesome for merchants that rely on their service, huh?) 
@_date: 2015-02-28 13:09:46
merchant transactions have not been forwarded yet, so I wouldn't claim victory yet
