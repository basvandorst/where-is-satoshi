What you mean exactly?
@_date: 2016-04-02 16:31:46
Do you have any infos about that?
Since nowhere this is explained i can doubt about it. Seems legit. 
I'm not accusing (yet) anyone. 
Saturday is not a customer service day? Are they orthodox jews? I think that a big company like that should at least have a responsive customer service....
looking forward to see what come from all this.

This is the address where my funds went:  Now it has only 8 BTC of balance and it keeps sending BTC away but mine still didn't get executed.

Sorry about the title capped, but waiting a week or two seems too much for a BTC payment that could be done automatically every minute witha simple cron.
I simply do not understand where my coins are moved(?!?!?) and why they don't reply to my ticket. I don't care how the company big is, if they act as scammers i will threat them such that.
I'm not saying they are just trying to gather informations about it.
But if they won't reply me in 24 hours i definitely think they are trying to make some illicit moves with my BTC or similar...

This reminds me when the US governement sued Aron Swartz, they want an escape goat to give an example punition. This is truly against any human right.
Fuck USA and their corrupted and ill system.
