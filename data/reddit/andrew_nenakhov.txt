What you are saying is that email is centralized because so many users use Gmail or Yahoo. But it isn't despite that. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 18:30:39
Banks will feel just fine in a world that uses bitcoin as main currency, don't worry about it.
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:50:10
There is no need to counter your obvious misinterpretation of terms, but since you really persist, email is not centralized, just email servers are. That does not make email protocol centralized. Also, internet consists of servers and connections between them, and every server is not 'decentralized', yet, Internet iIS decentralized.

Ha-ha, that was really funny. My company created the most popular xmpp client for android (you know, XMPP, federated messaging protocol), and you tell me to research 'some technology and terms'. Made my day, thanks.

Supply of tulips was unlimited. Supply of bitcoin isn't. (Though the latter was kinda circumvented by unlimited altcoin supply)

Graph available on tap would be pretty much it, thanks. No real need to draw graphs right on widget IMO. Good luck to you. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:05:57
Somehow even your 3x1 widget has lots of space on the sides. I'd rather have bigger badge (possibly with more info) within 2x1 box.
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:44:24
Looks great. I currently use this one, 
It has a nice feature to draw recent price graph. Would be nice to see same too in your widget.

If markets did really follow previous behavior, all trading by now would be performed by trained neural networks. But they don't. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:30:35
Not with bitcoin! ;)
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:16:51
Not everything that has a server is centralized. You see, there are systems that use federation of servers. Like email, or XMPP, or, you know, Internet. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:20:16
Actually it is extremely costly and difficult for Russian company to both send or receive money from abroad. Wicked rules and draconian fines if you misstep some of rules. For example: you have to notify bank on incoming USD payment (provide documents for it). If payment doesn't come on exact date, you are fined 100% of payment. Pretty cool, huh?
@_date: 2018-01-28 06:06:38
but peer-to-peer money exchange and whatever other properties bitcoin has does not threat banks in any way. If bitcoin is money, banks are fine with it.

As I said, we're developers of an XMPP app, not telegram. "Chats make ways to us" because junkies are stupid, and sometimes email complaints to our support if they have issues with their vendors. Our app unfortunately is cited on all deepweb forums by merchants (alongside telegram, yes), and all of them accept cryptocurrencies as a sole means of payments. So this and other stats posted by russian government about a number of drug addicts in russia led me to make an estimation about cryptocurrencies usage in Russia and nature of such usage.
@_date: 2019-07-11 21:24:30
Can't say for the rest of the world, but 80-90% of Russians who have used cryptocurrencies must have used it to buy or sell drugs. Pity but true.
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:34:06
like hissen_raii said, IT-minded geeks use Habrahabr and Geektimes, but they are markedly less free than Reddit, administration there is very prone to voluntarily blocking users left and right whom they thing are breaking their rules, especially about self-promotion. I've personally quit those several years ago after some outrageous action by site administration. 
@_date: 2019-07-11 23:08:48
We're developers of a popular xmpp app that is (sadly) ultrapopular with this subset of population. Sometimes their chats make ways to us - some idiots complain right on Google Play reviews that they didn't get the goods! So it's an estimate that checks well with estimated number of people who did try some kind of drugs at least once in their life.
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:30:00
Few do. I'm from Russia and no one I personally know uses Reddit at all.
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:26:33
That looks like some clown with fake medals. Most likely Russian who pretends to be a cossack.
@_date: 2018-09-03 09:57:48
I understand the 'point', but I also understand the limitations of current technology. Current one does not scale all that well, so you need some solution to increase throughput. One solution is to make blocks bigger, like those bcash guys suggest, other is lightning network. I actually think you misunderstand purpose of LN - it's not to make repeated buys with one merchant cheaper, it's to find shortest and cheapest route. So designers of LN clearly think that this network component is important. Maybe they too misunderstand the point of peer to peer cash. :-\
@_date: 2018-09-04 22:10:42
Not really. In Russia you a free to do things only until someone decides you are not. For example, buying and selling bitcoins could easily qualify as terrorism financing or money laundering, and judge will of course agree with prosecution. 
@_date: 2018-09-23 21:58:27
So, if you, like many others, say it's NOT around the corner, does this mean it is around the corner?
@_date: 2018-09-02 20:04:47
I don't think you should open a channel with merchant. You should open it with your "bank" - a special node that exists to facilitate payments on network. When you pay some merchant, transaction finds a route in existing g networks, just like it does with current visa/MasterCards. Big "bank" nodes should be big and interconnected with each other, and you won't need closing channel often because your node ran out of funds.

Bitcoin is not legal in Russia. It's legal status is not defined, that does not mean it is legal. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 19:27:02
Just recently on this week I observed them have ~3 blocks per hour for quite some time. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 23:44:05
How exactly did he have it in 10 seconds? Was block found instantly after you've sent it?
@_date: 2018-05-30 16:39:12
You will need to remove 24 words from a list. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 11:44:44
Thank you cap!
@_date: 2018-08-10 18:02:59
Probably your wallet simply displays all incoming unconfirmed transactions. Most likely block that confirmed this transaction wasn't mined yet, unless you are very lucky. Consequently, if block wasn't mined yet (they are mined on average every 10 minutes), you didn't really 'have' thise bitcoins in your wallet, even if wallet did display them as such. 
@_date: 2018-05-15 12:17:19
Bitcoin could hit 0 by January 1, 20190
@_date: 2018-05-30 17:50:42
The one idea behind seed phrase is to generate a predetermined number from which to generate a wallet. If your vocabulary is, say, 65k words, then 24 word seed phrases makes 65000^24 combinations. Each removed word makes seed phrase 65000 times easier to crack by bruteforce. If you disclose 23 words, your wallet can be recovered in seconds. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 06:15:22
1. Sometimes block can be mined within a couple of seconds after you mined block. So you might have your first confirmation right after sending transaction. However, it's not too likely to happen every time.

As are Tethers. At least it's what they claim. 
Everything you say can be applied to any product and any cryptocurrency. That does not automatically mean everything is OK with Tether, it's just that you argument that USDs are used twice in economy is not valid. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 21:34:38
Aren't you worried that when you buy some  shares for $ (or an iPhone), your dollars are circulating twice in economy, once in form of shares/iPhone, second in dollars? (And you can sell that iPhone, right, so it can be turned into dollars again!)
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:49:41
Fees, hugely expensive? Yesterday I transferred .25btc for 0.00000142btc. today I have withdrawn 850usd from PayPal to my Russian bank account - it cost me 3.8% (difference due conversion rate from official exchange rate rub-usd).
And yes, I did transfer right on that yesterday's block that took 1+ hour to mine, still got full transfer in 2 hours with such tiny fee. And my PayPal withdrawal... Well, they promise 5-7 business days so I expect it on 21st of June. 
Bitcoin had failed, really?
@_date: 2019-06-21 19:07:45
Sorry, more correct picture would be this: [
@_date: 2018-11-30 21:19:58
Yes, you'll be in great position to send these coins to spare address the moment you post it. "It was someone from Reddit!!"
@_date: 2018-11-18 12:53:12
Thing is, there are no such thing as 'moving funds between you own accounts' in bitcoin. Its all just addresses. You can, of course, have a 'bank' that keeps all money of all customers on one address, and keeps tabs on who owns how much, then you could possibly expect transferring between such customer accounts for free (or not for free, since banks have to earn their buck too)
@_date: 2019-01-17 21:38:24
Why would anyone at all pay fees if even 0 (zero) sat transactions are accepted in BCH blocks? ��
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:11:17
This is total bullshit. Blockchain tech has nothing remotely close to do with so-called 'elections'. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 20:33:27
It's just people cicrumvented the hard limit on the total number of Bitcoins by issuing more cryptocurrencies. ��
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:48:33
There is a way to set any fee you like, even 1sat. Just play with checkboxes and options a bit.
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:49:02
Because to get to 25k it first needs to break 12k, lol.
@_date: 2018-02-25 09:24:43
That's just usual blah blah blah. Also first guy is chairman of Sberbank - biggest state bank in Russia, known for it's inefficiency and controlling attitude towards anything. Oh, and also for blocking user accounts and demanding documents for every incoming sum of money. 
Would you be so happy about such guy "fully endorsing" blockchain technology? (Not Bitcoin, mind you)
@_date: 2018-07-13 09:15:40
There is no evidence that Gates ever made that 640k statement. 
@_date: 2018-07-14 12:41:35
Maybe because it's just a made up lie? 
@_date: 2018-04-14 23:12:48
Stats about Russians are false. Not even 0.7% uses them.
@_date: 2018-12-15 15:18:07
Unfortunately, people learned to circumvent 21M bitcoins limit by spamming shitcoins like BCH, BSV, etc.
@_date: 2018-12-16 23:39:21
Google/Apple pay is everywhere in Russia, virtually all POS terminals accept it. It's the same in the Netherlands (though these services are curiously not available for customers of local banks, only tourists can use it for now)
