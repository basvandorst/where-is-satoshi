Well if a company needs gold as a useful item, that has a lot to do with it's monetary aspects. It creates a secondary demand for gold. If you include jewelry manufacturing, tertiary demand.

They caught it and are going to pay out any losses due to the attempted hack. So...

They aren't shutting down forever. They are waiting for BTC to outpace their electrical costs.

Nah. Those coins are too centralized and the supply keeps increasing so it's going to lose value.

Haha...good luck India. First you have to find holders before you can prosecute.

Regulate one, others will pop up. You can't regulate what you can't see. Regulate exchanges and Distributed exchanges pop up. Tech will always be on step ahead of poitics.

OK, banker.

And there is the right question.
The answer is probably somewhere within how foreclosure already works. The surviving banks...most likely ones who accumulated crypto at bargain basement prices instead of trying to kill crypto... Will buy the other bank's debts at pennies on the dollar. The federal reserve will end up paying the rest as long as the failing bank was FDIC insured. So taxpayers will be paying of debt accrued by poor banking practices. That means CD's and other interest baring accounts will be immediately closed out and paid in full with a combination of tax payer dollars and liquidated assets. The surviving banks will most likely carry on charging you for your mortgage at full price while having only paid a small percentage for the contract transfer. So if you have a mortgage and you pay taxes, both will increase and if there is a bank run, the economy will likely mean your dollars are worth much less. Meaning....you are fucked. In the meantime, bankers who created this situation are enjoying their golden parachutes in a non extradition country.

To the scammer's credit, people who believe Trump's bullshit will likely believe this is real too. They know how to find self selected marks.

He means people trust a transparent ledger of transactions more than they trust a shadowy group of rich bankers. No surprise there.
