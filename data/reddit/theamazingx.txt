Same, bought LTC at 100 and sold at 105 after that 77 dip because tracking several currencies got wearisome, then Steam goes and announces their support.

If you're gonna make up a story, at least make sure the math adds up.


So at least 3, price under 4.5k, got it
Got it, so worth about 150k now. 100k gain.


So at worst you put in 150k at 19, so 114k now.
64k net gain.
pls go

General idea:
Mr Money Bags puts a fuckton into bitcoin, contributing to the current spike.
Mr Money Bags then short sells, “betting” that the market will go down
Mr Money Bags and his friends all sell at once, causing a dip in price that they hope is enough to scare new people with weak hands into selling as well. Domino effect, next thing you know, btc is at 9k again.
Will it happen? Who knows. Many people think not, since Mr Money Bags isn’t expected to risk enough USD in btc in the first place to create more volatility than crypto holders are already used to (which is a lot). Many also believe that the existence of the futures themselves brings legitimacy, which in turn brings stability.

So just because "big bruh" already knows everything, we should abandon anonymity altogether? You realize it's just as much about privacy between civilians, right? I don't think the overbearing parent, nosy neighbor, or crazy ex that might want to stalk your transactions have spy satellites.

Not on a personal level, not anymore. About as profitable as digging for gold in your yard with a spoon. If you're just a normal person with a gpu to spare, look into ethereum mining or similar altcoins. Whattomine.com was a nice start for me.

Depends how he uses the coins. If they sell them to someone or buy goods/services with them without sharing any (legitimate) personal information, there's not much to be done. Big exchanges are monitoring this laundering, sure, but small marketplaces or individual buyers likely aren't screening for those wallets.

You mean that it's heavily misrepresented?
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:45:10
I think you’re missing the point of “hodl”ing. It’s NOT to cash out, it’s to hold on until the market share is large enough for it to be a reasonable currency to spend. People celebrate the rising exchange against fiat because it represents a rising market share, getting closer to the point where it will settle as a global currency and increasing the buying power that their investment will have at that point.
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:53:07
No one is adopting it because of the volatility, but there are plenty of people buying to hold with the belief that it will be useful one day. Underneath the rise and fall of the mini speculation bubbles is an increasing number of stable believers with no intent to revert their funds back to fiat.

It's not big enough to be directly impacting the value of such currencies, and they're currently pretty stable as far as "real world value" is concerned, so they're still a decent measure of what you'd consider bitcoin's "real world value".

What is the best USD-&gt;BTC conversion process once you've moved to a secure wallet? Would you just use the same thing and then immediately transfer the BTC to your wallet from that account each time you buy, or use different markets entirely?

Banks only stop people from accessing it because they don’t actually have it all anymore. They can’t go off and invest/lose your ledger as they can and have with your fiat.
