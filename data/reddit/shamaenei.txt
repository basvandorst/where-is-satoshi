Also if you're a chrome user enable site isolation so every site is loaded in a separate process so they cannot steal your session data etc from memory by injecting a malicious ad in your browser.

I would like to second this. Their archival efforts of (internet)history is priceless in my opinion.
note: I'm a monthly donator.

As a C# dev that is currently helping them: Yes we would be very happy to get more on board.

Can I find NTumblebit on slack? If so where?
@_date: 2017-03-13 07:36:18
xor PM'd me about it. Thanks.

Yes. I would agree this would cause unrest but it seems mainstream media( tv/papers etc) haven't picked it up.
As for the US I'm trying to say their debt is not going to pile up much longer as it's already as high as a quarter million dollers per citizen.

If the proposed law in the EU that allows banks to disable withdrawals for 20 days can be in effect and they use the law that is already in place that enables them to empty every single bank account to save banks from collapsing I'm sure there will be little money to withdraw. 
In the US every single person has roughly $250,000 in debt when we divide the US debt across each member of the population.

The default is that it won't be listed. That doesn't mean there are no exceptions.

It has little to do with that. I think it has to do with

yes it eats my lunch and the next day/week apologizes and gives me my lunch back.

Having been a beta participant I can say that is not the case.
@_date: 2018-07-26 05:21:42
Congrats on your release as well nopara73 :)

It's up to the users to use it. There is no requirement to use it so it's a bit different from the monero situation.
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:20:43
I fully agree with this.

Patents are only there to limit innovation and progress. 
His presentation made very little sense. The slides he was showing were not explained at all. He might as well have turned his presentation into memes. This to me sounds like he doesn't have the arguments/analysis/explanation behind them and is not going to anytime soon. He was just spewing out fancy models with zero properly explained arguments.
Even with his 100MB blocks he is suggesting he is making great mistakes. Increasing the block size by 100 doesn't mean you as a miner get 100 times the fees. Fee sizes will go down tremendously because there is more than enough space in a block to fit everything in. Even if with the current block rate at 100MB's a block it's still less than 6TB's a year. I can run my own server for a small fraction of what he is offering and still be able to keep up with chain size without all his bullshit. I don't think it would be smart to move to a size like that anytime soon though. As you've seen this week the pool was clearly being manipulated by these trolls to make the current network look bad. The expensive big server nodes he suggest are the exact opposite of what we want right now.
The only part during his presentation that made a very tiny bit of sense was decreasing the hop count to nodes by not hosting them from behind a home router. That was about it. That doesn't mean running it on an RPI behind a home router is bad. There will be enough nodes running on a server in the cloud instead of behind a home router. Also there is nothing he can do about it. It will happen.

Hey if he does that I'm willing to offer him a fucking apology. I will still judge him for the toxic character he has shown during last week's meeting if that ever happens. There is no need for that elitism in this space.
Currently there is no proof. In this video he made a mistake within the first 20 seconds by stating he is going to sign a message using his Public key. Come on a great cryptography user doesn't make mistakes like that. No we won't fuck off. We want the truth damn it not constant avoidance of it. His self proclaimed title is to me still 100% bullshit.
Personally I want to know if Satoshi is dead or not or if he's currently turned into a puppet of the financial system or has been captured by a nation state entity or not. This matters more to me. It has nothing to do with having a great leader or not.

If it is hitting the disk a lot try increasing the max memory it is allowed to use in the settings. With that I can sync the full chain within a day. You have to have the bandwidth available of course.

Great job nopara73!
@_date: 2017-07-18 14:33:12
Nope it's not him. You need to dig deeper on this one. You believe things too quickly.
@_date: 2017-07-06 14:28:58
Yes I use an SSD. My setting has been set to I believe 8 or 12 GB's or RAM maximum (can't verify right now). It will use less in practice. You know that you've hit a good amount when you don't see 100% disk activity anymore.
@_date: 2017-07-18 14:44:15
Which is fine. I just hope you continue digging.

None. When quantum crypto comes up all keys that haven't moved to the new algo and key that are resistant will be cracked eventually.
