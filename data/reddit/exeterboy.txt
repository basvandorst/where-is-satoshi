Good grief people.  Gox has been stealing them all along.  Why do you think they wouldn't allow withdrawals of BTC?  If Gox allowed withdrawals the transactions would not have validated and the game would have been up long ago.  Gox was playing shell game-pure &amp; simple.

Where there is a lack of transparency, there is most undoubtedly something that is being hidden that the company does not want anyone to know.  My vote is that it is insolvency.

I would love for you guys to succeed-seriously.  But having said that....
This will end very badly for you.  I give it 90 days before the site is pulled down.
No small startup is going to negotiate a rewrite of the  chargeback policy that is in effect with any credit card company. Period.
AND-given the discussion seen here, you can bet you are now on the radar of a LOT of scammers.  I'll bet more than half of all the customers that are currently buying from you are planning on doing a chargeback the minute they get their bitcoin transferred off your site.

And now we know it was insolvency.

Good hell!  Like he has any right to ask ANYTHING of his customers (or anybody for that matter).  Hey Mark - how about you give US back our millions of dollars worth of bitcoin and THEN we'll think about acquiescing to YOUR silly little wishes.

What are the functions?  What are the services and/or advantages that a digital ID provides?

TIL that nerds don't know how to swing a pickaxe.
EDIT: Dude @ 4:40 is fairly proficient.

It's not that somebody doesn't want it to go over 1000-rather quite a few people are selling at $1000.  
The crazy thing as I been watching it, is that the market is absorbing it very quickly.  In less than 10 minutes 1700 btc have sold at $1000!
And now we're past $1000.
