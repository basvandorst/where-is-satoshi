**shrug** Look up SHA-256 on wikipedia. That's the technology inside it.
$600 for the 800Mh one... Which isn't much if you've already dedicated several grand into GPU mining.
Bitcoin forums talk about it often as well.
@_date: 2012-10-21 22:46:49
Dunno, I'm just assuming someone on the BC forums found out how. I don't have an FPGA so I never looked into it myself.
@_date: 2012-06-19 09:04:52
I'm excited :)
I wanted to invest in a single a couple months back, but couldn't bring myself to risk that kind of money. Now, for $150 I can get something way better.

homina homina homina homina...
And they are going to offer %100 trade in value for any singles or mini rigs. So you can keep up with the new technology!

Do you think the Jalepeno can be used as a password cracker also? If so, my interest has been piqued even more!
It would be so portable, you can take the Jalepeno, a good wifi adapter, and a flash drive with backtrack, and you would be an efficient mobile hacker.

Penetration testing mostly.

I didn't bother learning HOW they work specifically, but in short they have a super good watts to megahash ratio.
A BFL can achieve 800-830 megahashes while only consuming 80 watts of power!
If you were to get 800 MHs worth of GPUs the power consumption would be around 600-650 watts.
Of course there are more pros and cons to both options, but BFL is the way to go if you have the money.

What do you mean by "failed".
@_date: 2012-06-22 06:23:29
I'm a little confused about what you are saying. Are you predicting that bitcoins will remain the same price ,and miners will stop because they aren't making money anymore (due to halving).
@_date: 2012-07-07 20:50:57
Couldn't have said it better myself.
If the bitcoin community wants drama. Then i'll stand by the sidelines and watch this ship sink.
@_date: 2012-07-05 13:51:55
And he's holding the bitcoins and not doing anything with them? Did he really just scam 200k USD 0_0?
@_date: 2012-07-14 15:17:46
Mining is a POW system. The computation being done serves no purpose (except when confirming bitcoin transfers)
It is already artificial labor, isn't it?
@_date: 2012-03-26 06:07:01
Noice! You should get some BFL singles to balance out the power usage to profit ratio.
@_date: 2012-07-07 21:46:27
Lol, Pirate is making us look bad enough. We don't need any more scams.
@_date: 2012-07-07 20:51:48
What do you mean? Do you regret being a part of this community now that you realize there are idiots?
@_date: 2012-08-28 02:27:12
I've heard about your, but I don't know what you did. I do remember reading your farewell on the bitcoin forums.
What's your story?
@_date: 2012-03-26 08:37:25
And what's this about the SHA3? How much better will it be than what we already have.
@_date: 2012-10-21 21:22:26
AFAIK, yes!
@_date: 2012-08-29 15:03:41
@_date: 2012-07-05 13:15:20
Can someone bring me up to speed on this? Who is this "pirate" person, and why is he significant.
@_date: 2012-07-07 07:16:41
I can't believe this is all going down. It doesn't even feel real. It's like i'm reading a drama.
Can't wait to see the outcome
@_date: 2013-03-31 02:05:53
They didn't talk about bitcoins... They mentioned digital currency, but not bitcoins.
I was hoping to educate some people about bitcoins by telling them to tune into Discovery. Thanks for nothing OP.
@_date: 2013-07-29 09:26:31
I missed that part, thanks for pointing that out. We now know that he is an optimistic idiot.
@_date: 2013-07-30 22:49:07
Only 1.7% of everyones lost bitcoins have been reimbursed so far. This one and only reimbursment was made **7 months ago**.
Roman (founder? of bitfloor) has also stated on bitcoin forums something to the tune of, "Bitcoin isn't real money, therefore I don't owe the people who lost their coins anything." (not verbatim, obviously)
To say the least, things are not looking well.
@_date: 2013-07-26 07:25:51
Don't count on it (in any reasonable amount of time at least).
@_date: 2013-07-28 04:37:32
Why on earth would someone loan BITCOINS, of all things, to a stranger on the internet?
@_date: 2013-08-01 10:04:36
I was talking about the previous hacking that took place September last year. AFAIK that was the **only* hacking, so what are you talking about? Was there another hacking that I was not aware of? Possibly
@_date: 2013-03-17 17:26:41
Yeah, learned that the hard way with the whole bitfloor hacking. 
@_date: 2013-07-25 16:13:52
I'm still waiting on my 4 bitcoins that were lost a year ago in the hacking.
Yeah right, like I will ever see those again.

I believe this is called fractional reserve banking. Banks only need to keep a fraction of deposited money in reserve, while they are able to loan out the rest. I'm not so sure the 9:1 ratio is completely accurate though.
If I recall correctly, it is the central bank (federal reserve in US) that determines how much money a bank has to keep in reserve, and that amount can differ from bank to bank.
