Hello again,
We are thrilled that you are so passionate about BitGold.  Reddit is perfectly fine with me - in fact, one of the main reasons we are going public so quickly is to create an open and transparent dialogue with our consumers.  We are focused on building trust in such a fastidious and often misunderstood realm. 
It is great that you are doing your research about our founders and our team but I think there was a misunderstanding in your findings. Our founders’ have both found great successes in the financial services industry and have a history of making well timed and successful investments in a variety of industries and sectors, including great tech organizations.  For example, Roy seeded China's largest Social Lending Site (PPDai) recognizing that trend early and now owning a considerable amount of an Alibaba and Seqoia backed tech company. Intellectual Ventures is backed by Bill Gates. etc. etc.
We also have quite an impressive development team, I can assure you.  I think you are misinterpreting our lack of outward facing information with clandestineness.  You wouldn’t expect a football coach to release his playbook to the media before the big game would you?  
We have a 10 person strong development team and coders.  Our backend runs on Scala and we actively hiring Scala developers in the GTA Region to continue to grow.  Our frontend is built on angular and node.js and we have some of the most brilliant designers I have ever worked with. As for myself (though I have an inkling you have already briefed yourself on my LInkedin profile as well), I come from AOL Canada and Huffington Post where I ran digital strategy. 
While I understand your scepticism in this industry, both cryptocurrencies and gold have seen their share of ‘smoke and mirror’ type organizations - and this is an uphill battle we are prepared to fight in earning trust - we believe that BitGold will empower everyone and we are more than ready to prove it once we launch.
As before, feel free to email me at emily for any further questions or comments. Maybe we can even have you down to the office for a tour and meet and greet with the team!

I love your passion - it is great to see people who care so much for cryptocurrency and bitcoin - and I couldn’t agree more - skepticism in this area has been ubiquitous and it’s something, as I previously mentioned, that we’re working very hard to combat.  I do implore, that if you are motivated by improving the perception of the industry, then work with us to change the dialogue.  
I apologize if you feel I haven’t answered your questions adequately - I’m sorry you feel that Josh and Roy don’t have the experience - but luckily, they aren’t working alone.  They have built a great team as I previously mentioned. 
We’re striving to prove that you don’t have to have to be in Silicon Valley to be a great tech start-up.  We are very proud to be apart of the great and growing start-up landscape here in Canada and to have raised such great capital from such influential, successful and well informed investors who have done their due diligence ten-fold prior to getting involved financially. 
I assure you we aren’t a ‘scam’ as you so readily accuse.  We are very excited to launch and prove this to you and the rest of the world.
Again - feel free to drop by our office or send me an email anytime!

Hello, this is Emily Cornelius, head of Digital Marketing and Public Relations for BitGold. I noticed this post on my reddit feed and thought it deserved an immediate response. 
I am going to take everything you say here at face-value in terms of your intentions and genuine concern. 
BitGold is purposely not releasing the full details of its platform as the founders (Roy and Josh) have worked on the design and implementation of this idea for nearly four years. The platform is very robust as you will see when the company launches in full beta mode. The countdown will kickoff a private beta round. 
It is your right to express yourself and hypothesize about what BitGold may be but you are spreading misinformation. We have not lied about our backers. The company is 6% owned by Soros Brothers Investments the investment vehicle of Alex and Gregory Soros. Sprott Inc. the parent firm of Sprott Asset Management has agreed to lead the Go Public Round by committing $2 million dollars (reflecting a pro-forma ownership of 8% of BitGold). 
While you may be disappointed in the lack of information on the landing page or details surrounding the platform, I can assure you that we use the platform every day and every investor has seen, used, and was impressed by the technology. I can only encourage you to be patient. That said, you may not be aware that BitGold's stated goal is to increase global access to gold. Bitcoin, and the blockchain are important technologies we embrace but do not exclusively rely on to achieve this mission. 
As for your comment relating to broker fees and warrants, you may be unfamiliar with the Canadian Capital Markets and the Toronto Stock Exchange Venture. BitGold's Go Public Round is being co-led by four of the largest investment dealers. A 6% gross commission with 6% over-allotment on warrants is completely standard.
If you truly want to learn more and/or obtain responses to your concerns or questions, you may reach me directly at emily
We are all very excited at what we are building here, and I am sure the majority of users will agree when we unveil the platform.
Emily Cornelius
