Coinbase is pretty solid.

I'll go ahead and post a skeleton of what I have. 
Recent appraisals have Bitcoins ranked at $29.34 – that’s more than an oz. of silver! 
But what is Bitcoin? 
-A currency without a central organization or authority. Bitcoin relies on peer-to-peer networking and cryptography to work. Individuals can send bitcoins for free, but are charged for express transaction. It can send money via Internet without any fee (like email sends messages, etc). 
-Bitcoins are issued to “miners” who use cpus to generate solutions to problems. 
-Money is spent by sending a special code (digital signature) and this prevents double spending
-Purchases are available in the network of Bitcoin, so users are masked through anonymity of the address – instead of keeping transactions private like traditional banking
-There is about $300,000 traded every day. 
-Bitcoin has been blamed to facilitate money laundering, tax evasion, and trading drugs and child porn. 
-However, there are a lot of sites who accept Bitcon – and more are growing, both in the formal and informal economy. Some examples include Reddit, WikiLeaks, Domino’s Pizza, and even a house in Virginia (for 10,000 Bitcoins). 
Bitcoin: How would the primary approaches look at it within the global financial system? 
-	Liberal: The exchange of currencies and provision of credit should be determined by private actors in the marketplace. However, since the currency is not centrally owned by a nation-state, the only way the social-democratic model could intervene would be to use its economic muscle and shut it down which the US government is trying to do (the FBI had a report that tried to give Bitcoin a black eye)
-	NeoMarxism: Bitcoin is a system of the liberal financial system that will further instability and promote even more inequality – especially if Bitcoins gain enough steam to affect tax revenue (thus creating havoc for those dependent on the Welfare State) 
Look at Bitcoin in terms of the Mundell-Fleming model:
-Mundell and Fleming said that a state could not have a currency that simultaneously has a supply of money and interest rates, stable exchange rates, and free flows of capital through borders
-What 2 of the 3 specifications would Bitcoin have? Because of the reliance on the internet, Bitcoin needs to flow through borders. Plus, there is a supply of money and interest rates. Therefore, Bitcoin will be exposed to instable exchange rates

Come to monterey. I know some people who would be interested in talking with you.

I am going to mention that in my Marxist perspective of Bitcoin. On one hand yes it would lead to probable dissolution of the nation-state, but that's exactly what Marxists had said would lead to it: the liberal financial system would bring about instability in nation-states (and, which I think will be debatable, will bring about inequality). In the meantime, buy as much Bitcoin as you can, I guess. 
I'm not going to be completely critical of Bitcoin; this factor is just something that I'm curious about.

Thank you for helping with the miner aspect. I wasn't really clear on it since I was reading academic journals in the social science -- we social scientists aren't very good with computer details.

This is just a rough draft. I'm definitely going to add more, but it is only going to be a quick 5-10 minute presentation.

Yeah, I was expecting the $300,000/ day to be out-dated since I grabbed it from an academic journal from Winter 2012 -- it's amazing to see how much steam has been picking up in the Bitcoin realm since then!
