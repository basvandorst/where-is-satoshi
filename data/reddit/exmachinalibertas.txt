I'm actually pretty curious to hear your rationale about this one.  Do tell, what makes your religion logical as opposed to all the other religions that aren't logical?  (And are there any other logical ones besides yours?)

[Vera Crypt]( is an actively maintained TrueCrypt fork.  I'd recommend that.
@_date: 2016-08-18 17:06:41
That wasn't your point.  Your point was that there was some secret agenda to get people to use bad security practices and potentially download malware.  My comment was directed at refuting that point.  In regards to this new point you've brought up, yes that is a valid concern, and you should definitely carefully vet any PGP keys in order to ensure that you do indeed have the correct key.  My comment should serve only as one data point among many that you collect.
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:29:35
That'll work just fine.  You just need to have it decrypted and mounted while you use the Bitcoin software.
@_date: 2016-08-27 08:52:19
Yes, if you have a well connected node, you could easily write a script to do that.  It might not work every time, but you still significantly reduce the chance that the double-spend would work.  Just have a script that auto-created a high fee "child pays for parent" transaction as soon as you see a double spend attempt.

You can't possibly think it's acceptable to encourage people to download a google drive link for an unverifiable database.  That level of security might fly for governments and international banks, but this is Bitcoin.

Oh, yeah, if you can access other copies, obviously go do that.  You clearly wrote this one down wrong if you've had it working before with other copies.  I was assuming you didn't have any more copies but this one.  Yeah, go get the other copies.  Definitely.

That's why you try to verify things from multiple different sources.  For example, not that you should trust me or take my word for it, but I can verify that Wlad's binary signing key is indeed
    01EA5486DE18A882D4C2684590C8019E36C2E964
Now you have two independent sources claiming that.  A few more, from places you trust, and you'll be reasonably certain it's the right key.  Then anything signed by that key implicitly carries that same level of certainty (until Wlad starts posting about how his key is compromised...)
@_date: 2016-08-25 18:14:02
How goes it?  Were you able to recover another copy of the seed?
@_date: 2016-08-22 02:20:24
There is no fungibility without privacy.  And there is no privacy with anonymity.  Ergo, fungibility requires anonymity.
@_date: 2016-08-18 17:50:44
Yeah but... where *else* is he going to post it?  The chain of trust is already broken if you assume the website is compromised.  No links to anywhere else can be posted, because you can't trust those.  Any PGP signed fingerprints can't be verified unless you already have and have verified that PGP key.
There's no method of verification that isn't circular.  That's the problem-- there's no security bootstrapping mechanism.
Therefore, there's *nowhere else* that he can post it that doesn't offer the same security concerns you have with the website.  So he might as well post it on the website.  It doesn't do any *additional* harm, and if the website isn't *currently* compromised but may be in the future, it may do a lot of good.
But yeah, you bring up the very reasonable point that bootstrapping security trust is hard because you have to start somewhere.  That's why I go through a lot of pain to verify PGP keys that I rely on, because once I know they are secure, then I can easily and quickly verify everything else that relies on the security of those keys.  For example, this whole fiasco with the website doesn't concern me at all because I had already gotten and verified Wlad's signing key many months ago, so I knew I had the correct one and didn't have to worry if what the website was showing me was correct.
Bootstrapping is difficult and annoying, but it's a necessary first step to avoid situations like this.  That's the purpose of key signing parties.

Bear in mind I pulled all those numbers directly out of my ass, so take the analysis with a grain of salt.
I think they're at least in the right ballpark, but you could learn for sure by researching the history of Bitcoin exchanges and how many got hacked after what period of time.  I don't want to go through that effort, but if you have a lot of money on exchanges, it might be worth the effort to do it yourself in order to have a better idea of exactly what your risk is.
But if you're averaging something insane like 5% or more per month, it's certainly going to be worth the risk.
@_date: 2016-08-24 19:59:17
As a last ditch effort, try downloading a Electrum version 1.8 and 1.9 and 2.0.2 from the [directory of previous Electrum versions](  If *that* still doesn't work, then you're getting into "being screwed" territory, where you might have to contact who runs [this site](  He's basically a professional bitcoin password cracker, and he'll almost certainly be able to figure out your actual seed and get you your money back... but he charges 15% of the amount recovered.  And of course you have to give him your seed and are trusting him.  But he's got a good rep over many years, so I wouldn't worry much about that part.  Unless you have 6 figures or more worth, in which case, maybe keep trying yourself for a bit.
But you said you've used the seed before on Electrum and that it was generated on Electrum.  If those statements are true, a new 2.x Electrum version and/or an old Electrum 1.x version will definitely be able to decode it.  If it's not decoding, then the statements you made about definitely using it before and definitely being able to decode it before **cannot** be true, and yet you're sure it is true.
Electrum is completely open source, so we can check its code, so we know for a fact that the Electrum software didn't change or glitch, your seed is incorrect.  Which means this latest copy of your seed was written down wrong.  If that's not the problem, AND it doesn't restore correctly with older Electrum versions, then you're remembering wrong about creating and using the seed with Electrum previously, because that's the ONLY possible explanation.
So if you get another copy and it's the same, it might be time to contact Dave.

I suppose the possibility of evidence is worth something, sure.  The thing is, I've been around these types of situations multiple times.  I've been around a half dozen major Bitcoin exchanges going bust or getting hacked.  I've been around for darknetmarkets closing and stealing user funds.  I've been around for online poker sites cheating players out of their money.  Then I saw other poker sites get shutdown by the US government.  I also watched employees get screwed out of pensions they had put money into.
I've just seen these types of scenarios play out over and over and over.  In the end, whether it was the fault of the people controlling the money or not, that rarely mattered.  All that mattered was users' money was gone.  They often grabbed pitchforks and filed lawsuits and got governments and law enforcement involved, and very occasionally, somebody went to jail.  And in 95+% of those situations, none of that got the money back.  Very *very* rarely, *some* money managed to get returned, but only a fraction, and only after *years* of red tape and waiting.
I've learned the lesson from all of these events.  When money is in control of somebody else, it's at risk.  They might steal it themselves, or lose it through incompetence, or through sheer bad luck.  It doesn't matter how.  Whatever the case may be, they aren't going to put my well being above their own.  That site owner or company owner isn't going to sell his house to pay me back for my house.  Some hacker going to jail for 5 years is probably thrilled to death about it if he has $20M in Bitcoin waiting for him when he's out.
Now, it's possible that risk is worth while.  Maybe you're a very good day trader or investor or poker player or whatever, and leaving capitol online to work your magic with is worth that risk.  Occasionally, I take that risk myself.
But I understand that it IS a risk.  When somebody else has my money, it's no longer my money, it's an IOU.
There's only one rule in the Bitcoin world, which you ignore at your peril:  if you control the private key, it's your money; if you don't control the private key, it's not your money.
@_date: 2016-08-07 03:05:13
Yes, that would be enough.  But OP's post was talking as if he was the entity that lost the coins, not merely a customer of some other entity.  So yes, if you are a customer of an exchange and it's widely known that they lose your funds, you can likely explain that to the tax authorities.  But if you *are* that entity, it's much more difficult, if not impossible, to prove you were hacked versus you just stole the money yourself.  How does anybody know that the address the hacked money went to doesn't belong to you?
That's what I was getting at.  But yes, as a customer, it's easy to show your loss, because you are able to show you that relied on somebody else, and so as long as you can prove that, it doesn't matter if it was a hack or an inside job, you have proven that you lost the money.
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:35:58
Yes, of course you can.  You can sign messages with private keys that have money.  You can purchase things and show them those assets.
But why would you want to do that?  The point of my post was that it's hard to prove *losses* from Bitcoin thefts, and it's relevant that it's hard to prove them, because the IRS goes after people hard for tax money.  So the burden of proving Bitcoin losses is extremely important.
Do you understand why and how it's different to prove you have a Bitcoin key versus why it's impossible to prove you *don't* have a Bitcoin key?  You can prove you own a key by signing a message with it.  But you can't *prove* you don't own a key, all you can do is *fail to prove that you do own it*.  But that could also be you just refusing to comply.
@_date: 2016-08-23 14:09:28
You just randomly added another word?  Don't do that, that won't help.  Your word list as you had it is what you need to focus on.  You mis-typed or did something somewhere in it, we just need to find what the error was.  But don't go adding or removing words, that's definitely not the issue.
@_date: 2016-08-07 08:34:36

@_date: 2016-08-19 15:33:46
You're being ridiculous.  Solving the issue of security bootstrapping is a very useful thing to be doing.


It's only two if you download only their software and Bitcoin Core.  If you download their software and *other software*, their software ensures accurate DNS for *every* piece of software.  So it's not just 2 packages... it's 1+n, where n can be arbitrarily high.  But of course you knew that already and are being grossly disingenuous.
@_date: 2016-08-25 19:23:27
Nope, just being more careful is all you can do.
Bitcoin is an entirely different world than you're used to, money wise.  With bank accounts and credit cards and other stuff, there is inherent protection in the background.  You can tell them you were hacked or got your identity stolen and go in in person and give them your ID, and they'll cancel the card and do a chargeback and get your money back, and while it might be a hassle, you can do it at least.  The government requires that banks have insurance, so your deposits are always protected.
Bitcoin has none of this.  If you lose your private keys, you're just shit out of luck.  If you get hacked, you're just shit out of luck.  If you send the wrong amount or to the wrong address, you're just shit out of luck.  So you have to be extremely careful with Bitcoin.  It requires more care than you are used to needing for monetary things, because it doesn't have all the implicit protections you're used to having.
There are third party services that make the job easier.  Online wallets, exchanges, etc.  There's also services that specifically provide multisig accounts, so you get some ease of use while also being sure they can't just run away with your money.  Copay is pretty popular for that type of thing, but there's plenty of services to choose from.
I personally like to do things myself and keep full control, but as I just pointed out, that means I have to be extremely careful.  There are no undo's in Bitcoin.  When you're boned, you're just boned.
@_date: 2016-08-24 16:21:40
Have you had any success in the past day?  The only thing I can think of is that somehow you were using a BIP39 seed instead of an Electrum seed, so you could use that site I linked to in my other comment, and if it doesn't show you addresses you recognize, click on "BIP 32" part way down the page and change the path to "m/0/0" and see if that shows you any addresses you recognize.  Have you put your seed -- and all the "tent" combinations -- in that site?  (Or any other BIP39 software..?)
@_date: 2016-08-07 18:04:41
Then you can make legally binding options contracts to be executed when some chosen entity agrees that it's safe to move coins.
Yeah, Bitcoin isn't perfect.  You're going to have to find ways to live with that fact.  I think it's miles better than anything else we have, but yeah, you're always going to have some risk in life.  That's just how life goes.
@_date: 2016-08-23 15:02:14


Wait, did you make your words yourself?
Where did you get your words originally?  Did you make them, did Electrum show them to you, or did you get them somewhere else, like a phone wallet or something?  Because there are other wallets that use the SAME word list but derive keys differently from Electrum.  So tell me exactly how and when you got your word list.


You're boned.
But don't worry, I'm extremely confident that we'll figure it out.  It's REALLY difficult to fuck this up, and especially when you have the word list or something that is at least very close to the word list.  I think it's pretty unlikely that we won't figure this out.
I may have to leave for a bit.  I know you're eagerly awaiting getting your money back, but I don't know how often I'll be able to be at my computer.  So just be patient.  I haven't forgotten about you and I'll be back.  We'll figure this out.
@_date: 2016-08-18 15:13:54
It's the correct fingerprint.  Gavin explicitly posted it and signed it when he stopped signing the binary releases, and other devs have verified it in the past months.  I already had it in my keyring lsigned and trusted.
@_date: 2016-08-19 08:33:21
It has plenty of signatures.  [Here look.](  The first signature is Wlad's personal key, which was signed by Gavin's code signing key, [and many others](  The original key is also signed by a handful of other known keys including Core contributor Jonas Schnelli's key.
Run "gpg --refresh-keys" using a couple of popular key repositories, like the MIT one, and the main PGP one, and you'll get a buttload of updated signatures.

Freedom *must* come cheap, otherwise it's not freedom, it's just selling autonomy.  If Bitcoin was secure but so expensive only three people in the world could use it, then it wouldn't actually be promoting freedom.  Freedom implies the ability for everybody to access it, which like it or not, means the costs and barriers to entry must be relatively low.  Freedom only for some isn't really freedom.

How is a name mapping system with hash commitments on the Bitcoin blockchain *not* doing that?
@_date: 2016-08-07 15:15:15
Correct.  But in the same way that a 256 bit key is theoretically not as secure as a 512 bit key.  I'm not particularly worried about it, but technically it's less secure.
I re-use addresses, I'm not worried about it.  The far bigger concern with address re-use is information leakage with regards to privacy.
@_date: 2016-08-18 02:21:06
You will never get 100% mathematical proof of identity.  Everything has its problems.  But once you decide you have enough verification to just go with it, signing the key locks that in and shows to other people that they have at least passed your threshold.  It may not be perfect -- nothing is -- but it's pretty good.
@_date: 2016-08-26 06:07:45
You'd have to quantify the risk and the profit first.  It's a very simple equation:

It's a network built on top of bitcoin for transfering bitcoins via basically smart contracts.  It'll allow zero conf tx's that are not quite Bitcoin confirmation levels of security, but still very high security.  It'll allow you to accept those types of zero conf payments with very very little worry.  It's Bitcoin Core's "solution" to micropayments and safe zero conf payments.

No, it's not possible.  That's in fact the entire purpose of the blockchain.  If it were possible to determine the "real" transaction without a confirmation, you wouldn't need the blockchain to order the transactions.
However, double spends are extremely uncommon.  If you are selling things less than couple hundred bucks, you can probably just accept zero conf and just eat the very rare double spend.  Or you can program your wallet so show you the fee rate and sequence number and priority of unconfirmed transactions and only accept zero conf txs that are high priority.  Or you can wait for a confirmation.
Honestly, I just wouldn't worry about it.  They really don't happen that often.  So for small amounts, just risk it.  For a thousand bucks or more, then wait for a confirmation.

A single mining *pool* has a majority hash rate, NOT a single miner.  That is very different, because any malfeasance will be noticed immediately by individual miners who can and will switch pools immediately.  I'm not saying it's not a problem, but a single person with 65% hashing power in the form of hardware is fundamentally a greater risk than a single pool with individual participants who monitor the pool at all times and can change pools at any time.

Correct.  You can receive money without exposing it, but if you have ever spent money from the address, it has been exposed.  That's why address re-use is discouraged.

Just like how you can't mis-type Bitcoin addresses because the address itself contains a checksum, the electrum words you have also contain a check within them that tells software you've mis-typed them.  That's why the "next" button isn't becoming active.  There's a problem with the word list.
Usually there are 13 words, not 12, so it's possible you've forgotten a word.  Did you check all the words you have -- are they *all* on the version 2 list?  You didn't mis-type one of them?
You definitely have all of the words, and they're definitely in the right order, and they're definitely all in the list?

That's pretty hard.  You have to estimate the risk of losing your funds over the next [X] amount of time.
Here's an attempt at trying to quantify it...
Let's say half the exchanges get hacked on average every 3 years.  That seems reasonable, based on my observations.  So you've got a 50% chance of losing 100% of your money in a 3 year time span.  Do you think you can make (and cash out) half of the average amount of money you leave in an exchange over that amount of time?
Actually we should probably convert that into a monthly percentage.  Compounded it's about 1.13 percent, but that also means you have to leave your money on the exchange.  Cashing out each month would mean needing a 1.39 percent return.
Accounting for the fact that we might be off a bit, I'm just gonna round up and say you need to make 1.5% per month just to break even against the risk of an exchange getting hacked or otherwise stealing your money.  So whatever returns you have, subtract that as the fee you pay for leaving money on the site.

You're wrong.  Without privacy, one coin is distinct from another coin because you can tell it has a different history.  If one coin is distinct from another, then they are not fungible.  Anonymity is necessary for privacy because privacy is the ability to choose who you share information with and what information you share.  And in order to choose who you share with, you must be default be able to choose who to exclude.  If you cannot exclude *everybody*, then you cannot really choose who you are excluding (since you must *not* exclude certain people).  Thus anonymity is the baseline for ensuring privacy.  And if anonymity is required for privacy and privacy is required for fungibility, then anonymity is required for fungibility.
@_date: 2016-08-23 14:43:05
Hmmm.  If you're **sure** you've recovered with that exact list before, then it's *possible* that older Electrum versions were wonky somehow and you have a list that they accepted but newer ones don't.  I don't think that's likely to be the explanation, but it's worth trying at least.  [Here]( is one of the earliest version 2 releases.  You can [download the portable version]( and attempt to import your word list with it.
If that works, which I doubt it will -- but if it does -- then you should make a new wallet with your current up-to-date Electrum software (not with that portable one!) and move your money over to the new wallet.
My suspicion however is that even though you are 100% sure you have things right and have used that exact list before, that you're actually wrong and have made a typo or other mistake somewhere.
But, given how sure you are, we can at least test this out with the older version.

That's perfectly safe.  The only danger with HD wallets is if you give somebody the full xpub key, they can derive (non-hardened) child keys and you might lose some privacy.  Additionally, the xpub key (and any keys that can be derived from it) contains the *public key* not the address, so giving out an xpub key is dangerous that way too, because as mentioned in my previous post, you don't have the protection of the hash function that addresses use when your public key is known.
But just using or giving somebody the Bitcoin address derived from an HD wallet (but keeping the xpub itself secret) is perfectly safe and fine, and is just as secure as a newly generated random address.  So yes, use HD wallets!
(Big warning though... there is an attack on HD wallets where if you give somebody the private key to any non-hardened child key, they can derive the parent xpub private key.  So whereas if you gave somebody a private key to one of your random addresses and that wouldn't put other addresses in jeopardy, giving out a private key to any of your HD addresses *does* put other addresses in jeopardy.  So for example, if you gave me the private key to just one of your Electrum addresses, I could derive the private keys for the other addresses.  The HD format in upcoming Bitcoin Core 0.13 uses a different format where all child keys are "hardened" and so this is not a problem in that wallet, but most wallets that use HD keys are susceptible to this.  So if you ever want to share an account with somebody, either use a randomly made key, or make a new HD wallet entirely for them.  Do NOT share even a single private key from your HD wallet, as that could compromise the entire wallet and all your addresses.)

You're basically just arguing that a working decentralized DNS is completely useless.  And you're wrong about that.
Additionally, you don't seem to get that your argument about it being circular verification is wrong, because you can use this type of setup to verify other software besides Bitcoin.  So while the verification specifically between blockstack and Bitcoin might be circular, once you *do* have things verified, the system can be used for everything else.  (Only if you think name mapping is useful....)

Yeah, if you know how to pick apart the raw hex transaction, go for it.  The actual issue is an easy fix, it's the understanding how Bitcoin transactions and signatures work that is the difficult part.
A signature has two valid representations, which are linked together.  One is one value, and the second is that first value subtracted from the order of the curve.
Both values constitute a valid signature, but in order to make transaction malleability less of an issue, Bitcoin Core only accepts the lower of those two values as the "correct" value, and so it (by default at least) won't relay your transaction if it has the wrong value (although it will still accept it as valid if a miner puts it in a block).
So the fix is pretty easy:  If, when you convert the hex to an integer, the S value of any input's signature is greater than half of the order of the secp256k1 curve, change it to the order minus that S value.  In short:
    if (s &gt; N/2) {
        s = N - s;
    }
So for example, the SIGHASH_ALL signature
    304502203cf71f1c1b7ebdc50c1dc2701d53a33105ab6f43b00804583d5d9c149be8cc28022100e97502137561d4b623fe36a12dfd6ed487d0d12be715ccdb8e0cad153b35a73301
would become
    304402203cf71f1c1b7ebdc50c1dc2701d53a33105ab6f43b00804583d5d9c149be8cc280220168afdec8a9e2b49dc01c95ed202912a32de0bbac832d36031c5b17795009a0e01
If you make sure all input signatures have the lower S value, you won't run into the problem you had.
You should contact whoever signed the first signature on your multisig transaction and tell them they need to get with the times and update their software to use the correct lower S value.  This has been standard practice in the Bitcoin community for years now.

You're right, Satoshi never did use github.  He did however use the Sourceforge repository that Sirius-m setup, and in late 2010 he he gave Gavin full rights to that repository, shortly before disappearing in early 2011.  At that time, Gavin and Theymos were the only other people with the alert keys besides Satoshi, which means Satoshi had to have given them the keys.  Currently an unknown number of between 4 and 11 people have a copy of the alert key.
This isn't "believing what Gavin told me".  This is established history corroborated by multiple independent sources, with numerous references in writing on the forums and in available public speeches by various people in the Bitcoin development community.

Alright, I've fixed the transaction.  Two of the transaction ID's weren't valid, but I was able to lookup the addresses and find the correct transaction ID's which gave the right amounts.  The following transaction is the same as before, but with two important differences:  the transaction ID's are fixed, and the fee is 0.0002 instead of 0.0001 because the transaction is double the normal size of transactions, and I'm guessing you want it to confirm fast.  I took that extra 0.0001 out of the change output, so the address 12nKcsWG2FRFkiMYukFB4rsESwMoJrjz9a is receiving slightly less, but the other address, the one receiving the 0.5, is still getting the full 0.5.
You'll need to sign this new transaction.  If you weren't the person who signed the original transaction, you'll need to send the transaction over to them and have them sign it.  Whoever signed the original one is the same person who needs to sign this one.
If you/they are using a site like Coinb.in to sign it, you'll need it in this format:
    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
If you're using Bitcoin Core to sign it, you'll need this format:
    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
Those two things are the same transaction, they just have a slight tweak depending on the software that signs it.  The first one puts the original output data in the signature area of the transaction -- that's what Coinbin does (or at least, used to do -- I haven't used them in a while).  The second one leaves the signature area completely blank, which is what Bitcoin Core likes.  No matter which place you use to sign it, the final signed transaction will be the same from both -- they just differ in how they like to read unsigned transactions.
From your post, it sounds like you are using Bitcoin Core, so use that second one I gave you with the "signrawtransaction" command, and then broadcast the result.  If you need any more help, let me know.

If you made it within the past year or two (i.e. on version 2 Electrum), [this]( is the word list.  If you made it a long time ago with Electrum version 1, [this]( is the word list.
I don't remember about version 1, but for version 2, the word list has to have a hash beginning with a certain value, so the word list itself functions as a checksum.  That's very likely why you can't import it, because it's not a valid word list.  So check the list, and see if you can find the mistake.  If it's a version 1 list, just check for a word that's not on the list.  (And also do that for version 2, since that's likely the problem.)

It's not relevant because literally 100% of people understand what he means by "address" and how to read the input scriptPubKey to derive the "address" and create a transaction with an output that will be able to be signed by the same private key that create the signature in the scriptPubKey which spent the aforementioned scriptSig output.
Everybody but you takes that to be implied in the phrase "from address".  Even people who don't understand the above can STILL derive the "from address" with the help of public tools like block explorers.  Literally ONLY YOU can't fathom what the fuck somebody means when they say "from address" because only you are that fucking much of a giant aspey douche bag.
@_date: 2016-08-07 03:18:50
It's pretty safe.  In its current form it would be problematic, because people re-use addresses, and also RBF would enable attackers to view zero-conf transactions for public keys and then broadcast replacement transactions.  (These issues are problems when the elliptic curve math is cracked.)
BUT there's fixes that are already being worked out, and there's temporary emergency procedures that can be rolled out pretty quickly if something drastic happens like the Bitcoin elliptic curve is cracked overnight.  (Like an OP code for a hash commitment to a future transaction.)
The best thing to do if you're worried is do not re-use addresses.  Keep your money in an address that has never spent any money, and whenever you spend money, move all of the money into a new unused change address.  As long as your money is in an address that hasn't ever spent any money, you'll very very very likely be fine in the event of a catastrophe.  And when such a catastrophe happens, what you'll need to do is simply sit tight, and wait, with your money sitting in that never-spent address, until the fixes get rolled out.
(The reason the above paragraph works is because addresses are hashes of public keys, NOT public keys themselves, and the public key is only revealed when an address spends money.  So both the elliptic curve math AND the hashing functions would need to be cracked to get your money.  And it's generally known that hashes aren't nearly as vulnerable to quantum computers.)
@_date: 2016-08-18 12:38:06
That's why you use *multiple* \*independent\* sources.  The likelihood of an attacker compromising *all* of them diminishes as you add more and more, and *any* discrepancy alerts you to the fact that something might be up.
As far as HTTPS being MITM'd most browsers will give you "insecure certificate" warnings if that happens.  The attacker can hijack the session, but he can't forge the encryption certificate.  So as long as you look for the little green lock icon, you shouldn't worry *too much* about that.
(Although, you know, worry some, since CA's have been compromised and computer manufacturers are putting fake CA's in their OEM OS's, and the whole system is just broken by design, and you should really just be using Namecoin...)
But yeah, that's why you use multiple independent sources for verification.

Correct.  Gavin was given access to the Sourceforge repository in late 2010.  Satoshi left in early 2011.  Inbetween those two times, migration to Github occured.


Not for sure, no, but a dev who is known to have an alert key made that statement publicly, saying he would not give the exact number.
This was a video interview at one of the many conferences in the past year, and I don't remember which one, or who specifically said it.  I have in my head it was Gavin, but I'm not 100% sure.
It doesn't matter now though, since two months ago the alert system was removed from Core.  I mentioned it only as a point of interest follow-up to the fact that Satoshi gave Gavin the alert key before he left.

@_date: 2016-04-28 20:45:50
What happened was that two of the transaction ID's that you used for inputs were not valid transactions.  They didn't exist.  I used the signature data in the transaction you provided to guess what the address was, and went and found other different transaction IDs to replace them with, and when I added up the totals, it was the exact correct amount.  So my guess is that the IDs you provided were *malleated* versions of those transactions, and that transaction malleability created a different transaction ID than you orginally had.  Basically, you just had an invalid transaction ID for them.
If that is the case, then no the old transactions will never be confirmed because the malleated versions of them in effect negate/double-spend them.  Only one version of a transaction will ever happen.
Luke Jr. said they might be, because we don't know *for sure* that those IDs were actually malleated versions of other transactions.  Since those transaciton IDs don't exist anywhere and can't be looked up, technically it's possible that they were entirely different transactions, unrelated to the ones I found, and it's just a giant coincidence that they happened to be for the same amounts.  And if that was the case, your old transaction could confirm if those transactions who up on the network.
But I think that's extremely unlikely to be true, and it's far more likely that they were malleated versions of the real confirmed transactions, and that they will never show up and thus your old transaction will never confirm.
Either way, it will definitely not confirm if you send out this new one, because it spends some additional inputs that were correct and valid in your previous transaction, so if this new one goes through, then *those* will become invalidated, and your old one will guaranteed never confirm.
Basically, as soon as this new one goes through, you're finished and definitely don't have to worry about anything else.
Be careful about listening to Luke Jr.  A lot of what he says is technically correct but purposefully confusing, so you will come off more confused than if you just ignored him.  My personal advice is to just always ignore him.  That said, I personally very much dislike him because I think he is intentionally trying to hurt and confuse people, so my opinion of him is of course heavily biased towards that.
@_date: 2016-04-29 07:52:18
That's almost certainly what happened.  Your wallet was both out of date in terms of knowing about the true history of transactions, and also out of date in that it created the bad "high S value" transactions.
You should upgrade it and let it sync, and do the zapping and rescanning I mentioned in my previous post, and then you should download Electrum, and send all the money in your Bitcoin Qt/Core wallet to Electrum.
Electrum is lightweight and hassle free and won't cause any of the difficulties you've experienced.  If you run Bitcoin Core, you need to keep it updated and synced to use it.  With Electrum, you don't need to do that.  Luke Jr. would tell you you sacrifice some security by not using Bitcoin Core, but don't worry about it, it's fine to use Electrum.
And if you don't want to wait to do the zapping/rescanning/syncing, you can just dump all the private keys from the command terminal in Bitcoin, and import them into Electrum.  (Or rather, "sweep" them, which is where Electrum automatically creates a new transaction to send the money from your Bitcoin Qt/Core wallet to an address in your Electrum wallet.)

As you well know, the whole point of mentioning the alert key was that it and the SOURCEFORGE repository were the things he had control over.  When I use the phrase "he handed control over to Gavin", implicit in that phrase is that he handed *whatever control he had* over to Gavin.  Because Bitcoin is open source and the alert key is for a messaging system, yes you can say that he didn't have control, but the point is that whatever control he did have, he gave over to Gavin.


Satoshi gave full control of the SOURCEFORGE REPOSITORY to Gavin, gave him a copy of the alert key, and put Gavin's e-mail address on the bitcoin.org website and removed his own e-mail address.
If that's not "trusting Gavin" then nothing is.  He gave literally every part of the project over to Gavin.


No, you're just trying to rewrite history by arguing semantics and lying.  Luke Jr. would be proud.
I see now that you weren't actually interested in historical facts, you are purposefully trying to rewrite history and lie about facts.  You are a bad person and should be ashamed of yourself.  I hope one day you realize how shitty of a human being you are and endevour to change.

@_date: 2016-04-17 16:19:14
He has nothing to be gracious about.  They took his money without him having done anything wrong.  He was injured by their action.  Now they are returning the money.  Returning him to his prior state.  At no time has he been in a better position than he was when he first started.  There is no reason from him to be grateful.  They only caused him harm.  If somebody steals money from you and then returns it, you don't *thank them for returning it*, because they are the ones who stole it in the first place.

That means that not all of the inputs were signed.  Basically, you need multiple private keys to sign it, because it used many different transactions as funding sources, and not all of those private keys were available to sign.
You need all of the private keys for the following addresses to sign the transaction:
    1g69ikVtUPZzE8kxzJpr1Cb773wdVoiRS
    1r2hTFToaWnT2M1R7ojAnbLEwXETnKBZ1
    19ZaUwn1SbziuuxqGwiTAAT8EyowYxv7nx
    1BTQr2pMXMHCNqKm3s8kXxnytVAL19sFwW
    16RX2StBkeUU2113JauAVGr3G3K7XbMLRD
All of those addresses were used as funding sources for the transaction, so all of their private keys are needed to sign it.  The error you got basically means that not all of the private keys required have signed it, so it wasn't complete (or rather, it wasn't completely signed).
You may need to import those private keys into your Bitcoin Core wallet and then try signing it again.
@_date: 2016-04-29 02:22:08
Ok, it looks like you already have all the private keys, and that error code and what you've already said makes me think you definitely do.  So most likely, what is preventing the transaction signing and all your other problems is that your wallet still thinks those old malleated transactions are real, and it doesn't know how to deal with the fact that they conflict with the real ones in the blockchain.  So, there's a few things to do to fix that.  First, make sure your Bitcoin software is up to date.  Are you running Bitcoin Core 0.11.X or 0.12.X?  (X can be any number.)  If you are, close it down, and then you'll need to edit the short cut to it in order to add a command line option.  So right now the shortcut to it will read something like this (but maybe not exactly):
    "C:\Program Files\Bitcoin\bitcoin-qt.exe"
and you want to add the "zapwallettxes" options, so edit the shortcut path so it looks like this:
    "C:\Program Files\Bitcoin\bitcoin-qt.exe" -zapwallettxes
with a space after the last quote there.  Alternatively, you can run that whole command from the Run window.
What that will do is run the Bitcoin software but it will clean out all the transactions from your wallet file.  So run it and wait a few minutes or until it tells you it's finished.  (I don't know how it works, I've never used the command.  It might be near instant or it might take a little bit.)
After you do that, you're going to need to edit the shortcut again (or run it from the Run window), but with a different command.  This time you'll need to run:
    "C:\Program Files\Bitcoin\bitcoin-qt.exe" -rescan
That will take a few hours probably.  The Bitcoin application will open but the bottom sync bar will restart from the beginning.  It won't take as long as the initial download did, because it's just scanning all the blocks, not redownloading and verifying them.  But what it's doing is rescanning every block to see if there's any transactions relevant to your wallet.  And since you just cleared it out with that zap command, there will be no conflicts or problems.
Once that's finished, THEN your wallet will be up to date and accurate, and you can spend the money in it however you want.  You can just make a new transaction to send to the localbitcoins account, or you can sign that previous one that I made for you.  And this time there shouldn't be any problems signing it, because your wallet doesn't have the wrong transaction ID's.
So now that we've solved it, here's what I think happened.  I think some of the people who sent you the money you were trying to spend were using an old version of Bitcoin that created what's called a "high S value" transaction, and then when they broadcast it, most nodes rejected it because of that glitch.  However, your wallet kept it because it paid you and it wanted to make sure the transaction didn't get lost.  Now, it's possible -- even without the private keys -- to fix the transaction, and some people have bots that do that automatically and re-send them out to the Bitcoin network.  I think somebody did that to those "high S value" transactions, which created a new and different transaciton ID, even though the transaction itself was identical in every way that matters.  So the money your wallet thought you had was still there, just with a different transaction ID than your wallet thought.  So when you tried to spend that money, your wallet created the transaction using the wrong ID's for those previous transactions.  (When you send money in Bitcoin, you have to reference money that was previously sent to you, in order to prove that you own and can spend that money.)  And your wallet never discarded those transactions and ignored the valid ones because the valid ones conflicted with the ones it had for you.  So by zapping out all the ones it stored and then rescanning the blockchain, we've got your wallet in sync with the actual real transactions.
Did that make sense?

Ok, then, *in another sub*, post a hash commitment of your predictions, and don't include your reasoning.  Assuming they are specific enough, that would plenty good enough to prove your ability.  And without your reasoning, when you later reveal them, the information won't be of any use.

That's correct.  As I mentioned in my previous post, I know what the alert key is and what it does.  I don't understand why you are continuing to explain it to me.
So we're clear, you're no longer denying the historical facts about Satoshi handing control (of the repository, and also a copy of the alert key) over to Gavin, correct?
Edit:  Oh, I see, you're debating semantics by arguing about the word "control".  Ok then, do you admit the historical fact about Satoshi giving Gavin full commit access to the Sourceforge repository and giving him a copy of the alert key?

In Bitcoin, all money from a previous payment must be spent.  So if I send you 1 bitcoin, and you want to send somebody else 0.7 bitcoins, you have to make a transaction that sends them 0.7 and also sends 0.3 back to another of your addresses, so you still have that 0.3.  You have to do that because you have to spend the whole 1 bitcoin.  And when you later spend that 0.3 leftover, you'll have to spend all if it too, which may require you again having a second output that is your own address in order to get the leftover change back.
So what happened is the poker site had just over $500 worth, and they sent you $500 and themselves the little bit that was leftover.  Then the exchange rate price dropped a little bit, so your $500 was only worth $497.10.  Because you were paid in Bitcoin, not in USD, so the fixed Bitcoin amount you received stays the same, but the conversion rate can fluctuate a lot.
Also, do you mind mentioning what poker site you play on?  I'm interested in bitcoin poker.

It's half bullshit.  The time between when the user sends money to them and when the user gets paid in the other currency is less than an hour.  So it was their profits and operating funds, and whatever user money was currently being processed for an order during the theft.  The total amount of the user funds was orders of magnitude smaller than any other exchange though, since they only keep the funds for a very short amount of time.
But the majority of the loss was their own money -- their operating hot wallets.  So to say it's total bullshit and that it was all user funds that was stolen is basically a flat out incorrect statement.
@_date: 2016-04-28 20:33:26

I think this is it.  Like, we've won.  It's at least an inflection point on the elbow upwards.  Most major governments know about Bitcoin, most people have at least heard about it, it's been up and working properly for over 7 years, despite all the drama about scaling there's no reason to think it's going to settle down (or die!), and we're at the forefront of the physical limits on manufacturing ASICs, which means the trickle down of mining equipment will be more rapid (and thus increase mining decentralization).
Sure not everybody is using Bitcoin, but I think at this point is safe to call it.  Bitcoin has won.

Shutdown Bitcoin Core, replace the wallet.dat file with yours, and run Bitcoin Core with the "rescan" option.  In Windows for exmaple, you might set the shortcut target to be:
    "C:\Program Files\Bitcoin\bitcoin-qt.exe" --rescan
Then you're going to need to wait a few hours for it to do its thing.  Let it hang on whatever you think it's hanging on.  If it's still hanging in 12 hours, THEN it's *actually* hanging.  Before that, let it do whatever it wants to do, even if it appears frozen.
If you've force quit in the middle of something like this before, delete the wallet.dat in the folder, and replace with your original.  The wallet.dat may get altered/updated during this process and so you might have corrupted it if you force quit.  So just replace it again and start over.

Most sites that give "location" just give the IP of whatever node they first heard about the transaction from.  For example, blockchain.info is connected to like 1000 nodes and the IP they show on their site is just whichever IP they heard it from.
Not really reliable for determining the actual IP of the owner of the inputs.  What would be scary is if they got user data from exchanges, linked addresses to probable user accounts, and listed user addresses as the location, with a probability cloud for accuracy.

Can you give a layman's explanation why?  Couldn't whatever the simple python code is simply have defaults, and the Core code just assume those defaults?  I don't understand how it can be easy to have a way to do it with a script and not have code that pretends it's getting default parameters from that script.  In effect virtualizing that script input as the default action.  If you can have a script input parameters without additional complexity, then you can have assumption of defaults without that complexity.  What am I missing?
Edit:  Please do reply to this when you have the time.  I am extremely unsatisfied with "trust me, it's really hard" when you state how easy it would be to change those settings outside the program.  That does not make any sense as far as I can tell.  And I really do want to understand.

That's incorrect.  The 6 operators are big because miners choose to mine with them.  There's dozens of other pools at which miners can immediately switch to.  Those 6 are only popular because the provide slightly less variance and slightly better speed.  Those minor differences will be immediately given up if the operators start acting in a manner the individual miners really disagree with.

Oh ok, looking over your project, you're honestly probably further along than I am knowledge-wise.  All you really need to learn is the format of Bitcoin transactions, and how multisig redeem scripts work, (which will be easier once you learn about transactions).
These two sites ought to put you on the right path:
Using nlocktime is really easy.  It's just the last 4 bytes, and it's only in effect if the sequence numbers for all the inputs is less than the maximum.  There's some specifics about it to look up, but once you understand how transactions work, it's nothing to add in locktimes.

The mining program either was connected to a pool that handled the payouts, or it connected directly to your Bitcoin software and so the Bitcoin wallet.dat would have that mining money.


When you did that, I assume you closed the program, and reopened it with the --rescan option, correct?
If that's true and your wallet still isn't loading, you may want to look into [pywallet]( and it's [thread]( and try to figure out how to use it.  You can also post for help on the [development discussion board]( and at worst, you can try to get help compiling an [earlier version]( from back in the day.  I'm searching for 0.3.24 and 0.4.0 Windows binaries online that you might be able to run, but I'm having trouble finding them.
It's also possible that your wallet got corrupted or something.  I think your best bet is pywallet, and posting in the thread or in the board I linked to, for help in using it.  I don't know how to use it, so I can't help you there, but I think that's the most likely thing to yeild results.  That should let you dump every private key in that wallet.dat file, which you can then import into another client like Electrum or something.  (If you use Electrum, be careful!  The "import" in the newer Electrum versions actually moves the coins, makes a new transaction sending those coins to the Electrum wallet.  So make sure you save the Electrum seed if you go that route.)
Edit:  I know this is frustrating and a pain, but I want to make sure you know, your coins aren't lost.  As long as you keep a safe backup copy of that wallet.dat file, you will get your coins eventually.  And when you do, newer software like Electrum makes this problem go away.  In the future, when you have for example your Electrum words seed, that's all you'll ever need and you'll be able to get your coins immediately with no hassle, even if you wait 5 years or more.  You just need to get over this stump.  Bitcoin was brand new and hard to use when your wallet file was made, so this is a pain in the butt right now.  But you'll get your coins, don't worry.

If you're willing to put up with a bit of hassle, Comodo has a free program that goes beyond being an antivirus.  It's like UAC but on steroids.

Contact blockchain.info.  They keep backups of wallets, and should be able to link the wallet based on your IP address.  You'll probably have to go through some hoops, but eventually you will likely be able to get them to send you a copy of the encrypted wallet, which your password will unlock.  You could also do a hex dump on the text file, and see if you can make out some of the identifier and see if that sparks any memories.  And it may also be useful to provide when you contact them.
Always back your shit up.  Coming from the world of credit cards and banks, you may instinctively feel that it's okay to forget stuff, because somebody somewhere will have a copy and be able to restore your access.  But in the Bitcoin world, that's often not true.  Your private keys are yours, and if you lose them or forget to back them up, they're just straight up gone.  No insurance, no nothing.  No getting your bitcoins back.  It's really a whole new security paradigm that you have to learn to adopt.  You are responsible, and if you fuck up, that's it, there's no do-overs.
In this case, because you used a third party that has your keys, you are probably going to be able to get access to them again, but I hope this is a lesson you won't forget on being careful and having multiple backups!

On the one hand, I depressingly agree with you -- many things, like PGP have been around a while and just aren't used.  And big banhammers certainly make things annoying and hard enough that a lot of people just don't bother.
On the other more positive hand, I still think technology wins in the end, just over a larger time scale than we'd like.  Even encryption, as much as you and I may lament people not using PGP or whole disk encryption -- SSL is widely used, and other forms of encryption are the backbone of a lone of modern technology.  So even though not everybody uses encryption all the time, it's still gaining traction, slowly but surely.  Andreas Antonopolis in his speeches always talks about the laws banning the horseless carriage, and I think that applies here.  Car adoption was slow and expensive and nobody bothered... until slowly but surely more and more people did.  It might have taken 60 or 70 years, but the world eventually was pulled forward with technology.
And I think that's the case with a lot of this type of stuff.  We pull our hair out that other people don't immediately see the value and infrastructure doesn't immediately change for the clearly superior new technology... but such things just take time.  Lots of time.  Even with computers speeding that process up, it still may take 10 or 20 years, which while significantly less than 60 or 70, still feels on a day to day basis like a lot.
So in the end, I'm not worried... although I share your frustration at having to wait for the world to catch up!  I have one friend who has a PGP key, and he actively asks me to NOT encrypt messages to him because it's that much extra little bit of an annoying pain to open them.  Sigh.  But this is another part of the problem that can be solved by technology.

Thank you for the informative answer.  Can you point out where in the specification it outlines the need for that right 0/1?  I'm looking at it and I just don't see where's written, so I don't understand why it's necessary.
Also, do you happen to know if any transactions that were made using OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, so I can look at the raw hex transaction and follow it that way?  Thank you again for your help.

No, we have a whole variety of miners who currently right now choose to allow those 6 to construct their block template.  Those miners can at any time ditch those 6 people and mine elsewhere.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying so few pools isn't a problem, it's just a different and not as bad problem as six people controlling everything.

Your reward is that you are able to use the Bitcoin network without trusting anybody else.  You validate and verify everything on your own machine, and you know that information is correct because you've verified the hash of every block header and all of the transactions in each block.
I can use Electrum happily and safely because I connect directly to my own server.  I can know the block explorer I use is accurate because it only gets its information from my node.  I can vote for changes I want in how Bitcoin works, because I tweak and compile my node, and I solo mine on my node.  And if you ever see a block that supports BIP101 and has a coinbase that says "Holy shit I found a block!", you'll know who mined it.
Saying you don't get a benefit from running a node is like saying you don't benefit from seeding torrents.  You are paying back for the value that you get from the system, you are helping maintain that system and keep it alive and thriving.
@_date: 2015-12-06 01:31:23
Yeah, but it's still a bit problematic that the vast majority of nodes will consider transactions with fees less than 5000 satoshis (about $0.019) per kb to be the same as a no-fee transaction.  To get *any* priority above being considered free/spam, you have to spend at least 2 cents.
@_date: 2015-12-01 18:25:24
No, unfortunately, you are completely boned if you do not have the wallet or seed.  The wallet is stored encrypted, and the password merely decrypts it in order to sign the transaction with the encrypted private keys.  But the wallet is what actually holds those private keys.  So if you don't have the wallet (or the seed), you are out of luck.
@_date: 2015-12-12 22:27:25
You can see the outputs just pay to the script
    &lt;pubkey&gt; OP_CHECKSIG
instead of the now used
    OP_DUP OP_HASH160 &lt;hash&gt; OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
The operand OP_CHECKSIG takes the pubkey given immediately before it and compares it to the item that is before that, and expects that item to be a signature, and that signature belongs to the public key.  So when you paid that key, the output script is, as above, pubkey+OP_CHECKSIG, and then to spend it, you just add the signature to the spending transaction.
The new method takes the top stack item and duplicates it (OP_DUP), takes that duplicated item and hashes it, so it's now a hash.  Then OP_EQUALVERIFY verifies that the top two stack items are equal.  So that duplicated/hashed item is compared to the hash given in the output script, and if they match, it drops them off the stack and continues.  Which leaves OP_CHECKSIG, which expects a public key and a signature to be the top stack items.  So the spending script is signature+pubkey, and then pubkey is the item that is duplicated and hashed, and upon the hash verifying, sig+pubkey are all that's left, so OP_CHECKSIG is run.
I don't know if that made any sense or not.  Bitcoin scripting is hard to follow and I don't really know how to explain it well.

It is based on the actual size of the DATA being transmitted.  The actual text of the transaction that says "Send X amount of bitcoins".  It's not the size of the coins, it's how much space the transaction takes on your hard drive.
@_date: 2015-12-04 08:31:13
Yes, but you need to be mindful of your wallet and of the recipient.
The protocol itself handles it just fine.  A zero-conf tx and the tx spending it can both get mined in the same block and it's not an issue.
So you don't need to wait for a confirmation before spending money.  However, some wallets will block you from doing it, so that you don't try to spend double-spends or other transactions that will never confirm.
And some merchants (or other recipients) will not consider the payment as having gone through until you get a confirmation.  For example, most exchanges don't credit your account until 3 or 4 confirmations, to protect themselves against double spend attacks.
On the other hand, some merchants and services accept 0-conf just fine -- Bitpay for example clears the payment immediately, and whenever you pay somebody who uses Bitpay as their payment processor, you see that Bitpay marks it as paid as soon as the transaction gets broadcast.
So the technically correct answer is you can spend a 0-conf transaction right away... but the practical real world answer is it depends on your wallet software and who you're sending the money to, and how they deal with 0-conf transactions.  But the Bitcoin software has no problem keep both transactions in the mempool until they're mined.

Your questions doesn't mean much if you don't define how much time, energy, and money the poorest person is able and willing to spend to run a node.  Essentially you asked a question without an answer because the parameters of the question are arbitrary.
You also don't account for the relationship between Bitcoin's utility and the cost of allowing the poorest person to run a node.  If the poorest person can only run a node with 2kb blocks, the utility of Bitcoin diminishes enough for everybody else that they'd probably prefer to up the size so that he can't run it, because the marginal decrease in network security from losing his node is more than compensated by the increased utility for the rest of the network.
It's about tradeoffs and inputting the right parameters.  My own opinion is that BIP101 is a reasonable proposal and that the additional cost of running a full node on BIP101 is offset by the added value of the bigger blocks which allow more users and use-cases.  I think making the block size 8gb tomorrow would be too much and the increase in cost would be so detrimental that the network would on the whole suffer due to the cost and the potential for a large spam attack.  But starting at 8mb, and increasing from there, is I think a good happy medium that keeps the ceiling low enough where spam and cost of running a node and other things are still within reasonable margins, while allowing Bitcoin to scale for additional adoption.
Wherever you fall, you have to understand that it's a game of tradeoffs.  If you fall on the side that literally everybody needs to be able to run a node, then you accept that you sacrifice a lot of utility for that added protection.  (Which may in turn cause people to leave the network and make it less secure anyway...)  If you want no block size cap network-wide you accept that the utility of the network suffers because it will be clogged with spam, very costly if not impossible to run a node, and it will be so annoying and impossible to actually use that the network will suffer and possibly die.
So most people will fall somewhere inbetween.  The block size needs to be low enough that running a node is easy for most people, and thus the network remains robust and secure.  But it needs to be high enough that it can still be used and useful for people, so the Bitcoin units of account have enough value that miners keep mining.

I would have no issue if it *weren't possible* to mine without setting up your own mining policy.  But if it is possible, then they have to include defaults.  Matt's initial response made it seem as if including those defaults was very complicated while at the same time elsewhere indicating it was easy.  That's what confused me.  Additionally, as stated, if it is possible to mine without further setup, then there are de facto some kind of defaults in place.
We are all in agreement that changing the mining variables via API is awesome and should be made to be easy.  We are in disagreement about the default initial policy.  And Matt's original response made it seem as if there was no default policy.  Is that true?  Is it impossible to mine without manually setting these parameters?  If that's the case, then I understand the situation and have no further questions or issues.  If that's not the case, and there are defaults, then I take issue with removing space for prioritized transactions as a default, even if most miners don't use the defaults.

If that's true, how do you account for step 5?


If a user's vault balance is restored, that means coins must be in the vault address, correct?  If that's true, that means that Coinbase cannot unilaterally access them, because the whole point of the vault is that it's multisig.  And if there are coins in the address, and Coinbase cannot access them, then the user can manually retrieve those coins.
So what specifically is happening when the vault withdraw is cancelled?  Did the funds actually not yet leave the vault address?  Do you list a vault balance even if there is no money in the vault address?
What exactly is happening there?  Are you displaying vault balances that don't exist?

Distributed ledgers only work with cryptocurrency.  They are completely useless without it.
In order for a distributed ledger to remain secure, it needs to be able to prove to participants that it is protected.  The only long term-ish proven method of this is proof of work, which requires that many participants commit a lot of computing power to find a hash to prove that they expended that work.  And the hash includes prior hashes, which proves that the data in the ledger was part of that commitment.  Without economic incentive to pay for that equipment and electricity, few people will be willing to do it, which leaves the ledger significantly more vulnerable to a 51% attack.
Therefore, the unit of account on the ledger must have value, and mining must reward those units, otherwise the underlying incentive to protect the ledger goes away and the entire system falls apart.
So no, no you can't have a distributed ledger without a cryptocurrency.  They are completely intertwined.

I assume I can, but I want to check.... Can I put a CLTV script in a P2SH redeem script and have a CLTV output just be a P2SH address that doesn't reveal the lock time until it is spent?  I can already manually sign multisig spends, so I know that the input script that the signature signs is just the redeem script, so can I sign a CLTV P2SH script in basically the same way?  I assume I can, because why wouldn't it work that way as well.  Or does the locktime script have to be in the scriptpubkey output?

You can't choose the third key.  The third key must still be the same Coinbase key.  If Copay lets you make your own 2-of-3 wallet, you would need to import your keys and then also Coinbase's public key.
Not to be mean -- but it doesn't seem like you quit understand how multisig works, so I think the best thing you can do is make a new separate wallet on Copay and use EITHER Copay OR Coinbase, and not try to use the same keys on both.

I searched for a bit but couldn't find one right away.  However, whether or not the input was from a coinbase, it's exactly the same format and doesn't matter.  The coinbase is treated exactly like any other transaction output.  Should I keep looking, do you really need one with a different input?  (And if so, why?)
Edit:  The outputs of the transaction I linked to are [spent again]( so that transaction has pubkey outputs and the inputs are not from coinbase transactions.  Does that work for you?

It will probably take a few WEEKS to finish on an old computer.

I think you can.  Think about file-sharing.  Think about whether Netflix or iTunes would be around today if torrenting hadn't risen out of Napster's demise, and where we would be with regards to streaming music and movies.
Technology is what makes progress happen, and it drags the rest of the world, with its politics and problems kicking and screaming, into the future.
What do you think is a more effective tool against surveillance: voting, or learning to use encryption?  Google and Apple are starting to use encryption on their phones, and they are, as mentioned, dragging the FBI and NSA kicking and screaming, into the future.  (Not that I trust non-local encryption that I didn't implement myself...)
Technology shapes politics, not the other way around.  Because technology can't be stopped, and so the politics is by necessity forced to adapt to it.  Torrenting movies has never been legal, but that doesn't matter, and that illegal file sharing is why we have Netflix now.  The world adapts to the new paradigm that technology creates.
If major countries ban the Bitcoin-fiat border, new exchanges will pop up in other countries, and in person cash exchanges will happen more frequently.  Bitcoin will take a hit certainly, but over time, it will, as useful technology always does, drag the world kicking and screaming into the future with it.

Add into your conf file:
    dbcache=XXXX
where XXXX is the number of MB of ram you're willing to allot to it.  The default is 100, but if you have the ram and you set it to like 6000 or something, it will go much much quicker.  I have a machine with 8-core 3GHz processor and 16gb ram, and fast internet, and it was using a HDD not an SSD, and I set dbcache to 7000 and made sure port forwarding was working, and it was done in about 8 hours.  I have another machine that I never set dbcache higher on, and just left it while I went on vacation and it took 6 days.

Yes, miners can divert mining power and 51% attack another chain.  That's completely irrelevant to the discussion at hand.  As long as a non-negligible amount of miners (say 10%) mine on a chain that users and merchants consider valid, if they don't budge and keep on that chain, the other 90% of miners can do what they want on their chain and it still won't be valid because nobody else is using it.  Yes, they can attack the smaller fork and do all kinds of nasty things, but that doesn't make their chain any more valid.  If 90% of miners started making 2000 bitcoin coinbases and mining on that chain, while it would make for some popcorn-worthy chaos, their chain would still not be valid, and no merchants or exchanges would accept their coins, and other non-mining users would not accept their blocks as valid.
By your logic, miners get to decide whatever they want as long as there's a lot of them.  And that's just not true.  Other people have to agree that their tokens have value, otherwise they're just on an alt-coin that nobody but them cares about.  The fact that they have a lot of hashing power behind it doesn't magically change that.

Well there's three that come to mind without even needing to look anything up.  Satoshi changed the max block size from 32mb to 1mb, we hard forked to removed the create coins from thin air in the code, and the May 2013 split from database compatibility problems.  Then there's the numerous minor bug fixes and updates.  If you run say version 0.1 of the Satoshi Bitcoin client, even if you updated it to talk with other clients, it will never fully catch up because it will receive data that it does not believe is valid.  It will not validate the entire blockchain.
You may be compelled to nitpick about this or that thing by itself not technically being a hard fork by your own personally definition, but the fact is that older clients can no longer participate on the network.  That's what a hard fork is.  Older clients can no longer work and must be updated.
Would you like any further help?

In the bitcoin.conf file, add the line:
    dbcache=5000
Then shutdown and restart the node.  That will get it done in less than a day.
After it is done syncing, change that line to be 1000 or 2000 and restart it again.
That number is the number of MB in memory you want to dedicate for it to use for caching and doing its work.  The default is 100, and that is the bottleneck you are experiencing and why it's taking so long.  At 5000, it should take less than 12 hours.

So there's two general ways micropayments usually work.  The first one is where the user deposits a large quantity to a 3rd party service and that service does any micropayments and deductions on its own database, off the blockchain, and then the users cash out at some later time.  Think about how changetip works -- it handles all those transactions internally and then actual Bitcoin transactions only happen when you deposit or withdraw.  And so it can do 1 satoshi payments without a fee, because it's only updating its own internal records.
The second way is basically what the lightning network is doing, and likely is what you want to do, which is using multisig + timelocked transactions back and forth to create a micropayments platform.  Here's an example:  you have wifi that you're willing to rent for 100 satoshis every 15 seconds.  My client connects to your router and your router and my client make a 2-of-2 multisig address that both of us put in say 0.1 bitcoins.  (Your router has say 1 bitcoin sitting in it in order to do this so 10 people can connect at any given time, and there's some protocol that automates this.)
Now that address has 0.2 Bitcoins, and you construct and sign a transaction that pays me back 0.1 and you 0.1 but is time-locked for a day or two -- some amount of time that is clearly more than long enough for me to use your internet, and then some.  That's backup for me in case you just go offline, I can get my money back.
Then we start.  I write a Bitcoin transaction that pays your router 0.10000100 and pays me 0.09999900 Bitcoins, and this transaction has no locktime and can be signed and cashed by you at any time.  I cannot broadcast it because I don't have your signature.  But I can send it to you and *you* can broadcast it after you sign it.  Then 15 seconds later, I make a new transaction that double-spends that one but pays you 0.10000200 and pays me 0.09999800.  I know you won't broadcast/cash-in any of these, because in 15 seconds I'm going to make a new one that pays you even more.
All of this is happening off the blockchain -- I'm just making and signing transactions over and over, but they're not being broadcast to the network.  Eventually I finish my internet activities and tell you I'm finished.  So now you sign and broadcast whatever the most recent transaction I sent you was, because that was for the highest amount, and you want to broadcast it before the time-lock on that initial refund you sent me passes, so you can get paid the highest amount possible.  If you let the time lock pass, in a day or two, then I will broadcast that refund that pays us both 0.1, whereas if you broadcast your latest transaction, you get say 0.10000800 and I get 0.09999200.  So the threat of me cashing in that refund forces you to settle-up within a reasonable time.  (And all of these transactions use the same inputs so only one of them can be mined, and the others will become invalid when that happens.)
That's basically what a micropayment channel is.  It's just a novel system of using multisig addresses + nLockTime + incentive to allow for off-chain micropayments between two parties.  The only situation that's difficult to manage is the initial funding of 0.1 by both of us -- who goes first?  Maybe you're just a jerk and I fund the address and you don't, and even though you don't get anything (because it's a multisig address, so you can't get the money without my signature), maybe you're content to just watch me lose money.
There's a couple ways around that.  For example, the time lock and initial deposit may only cover two or three hours, so we each only risk a few bucks in the funding stage, and then we settle-up and start over every few hours.
So to make a micropayments channel, what you need to know is how multisig and nlocktime work.  Which is reasonably complex -- you definitely need to know the ins and outs of Bitcoin transactions and how they work.  As far as I know, there's not yet a good library for auto-implementing that type of system, so you'd have to set it up yourself.
How much do you know about Bitcoin transactions and how multisig works?  I might be able to point you to some good resources to get you started.

Making the bridge wider between fiat and Bitcoin is a good thing.  It allows more people to get and use Bitcoin.  Which grows the userbase and the utility.  Which helps further cement Bitcoin into the world.  If you don't want to use those services, don't.  But they allow people who might not otherwise get into Bitcoin to get into it, and it will thus be an known and available option for them to turn to when the fiat banking system fails them.  Making it easier to get into Bitcoin is a good thing, not a bad thing.  You are under no obligation to use those services.

That's true for all pools.  They are run by a few people, but if they ever do anything malicious, all the miners will instantly stop using their pool.

The users won't view it as an alt-coin, they'll view it as the only valid chain.  They will use whatever the valid chain is.  The fact that some miners are mining an invalid chain won't matter to them.  The rules of consensus state that you will accept the longest *valid* chain.  If your node views a block as invalid, you don't care who mines on top of it, because that chain isn't valid.  Miners can have a nice long chain of a bunch of invalid blocks, but if no users use that chain, no merchants accept coins from that chain, and they will be on what everybody else considers the "alt coin", then the coins they mine are worthless.  Do you see why alt-coin rhetoric is wrong?  Bitcoin is whatever the super-majority of the ecosystem -- the entire ecosystem -- views it to be.

So when you restored you wallet seed as a two factor, it actually did restore all the private keys, it just didn't tell you that, and it's still going to try to get you to use the TrustedCoin servers so that they can get their cut.
So what you'll need to do is restore it again, and this time without a password (on an offline machine if at all possible, to be safe!).  Remember the name of the wallet file you call it because we need to go find that.  If you're on Windows, open Windows Explorer or the Run box, and type:
    C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Roaming
The reason you can't just navigate there is that the AppData folder is hidden.  If you know how to unhide it, you can just do that and go find it.  But once you're in that Roaming folder, look for a folder called Electrum.  If you're on Mac or Linux, turn on "view hidden files" and look for a folder in your main home directory called ".electrum"
Once your in that Electrum folder, there's another folder called "wallets" that you need to go into.  There you should find all your wallet files, including the newly restored one.  Open that in a text editor.
Now comes the reason you didn't make a password when you restored -- your master private keys will be in plain text so you can get at them.
Scroll to the bottom of the file, and you should see something that says "master_private_keys" and two sub-entries called "x1/" and "x2/", and you should see another thing "master_public_keys" which has three sub-entries.  Copy the two private ones and the three public ones, and make sure you note which ones are x1/ or x2/ and so forth.
Now you're going to make a new Electrum wallet.  Go to the New/Restore, and select restore, but instead of two factor, select multisignature wallet.  On the next screen, make sure to change it to be a 2-of-3 wallet, since the default is 2-of-2.
On the next screen will be three text boxes.  In the first and second one, paste the x1/ and x2/ private keys from your wallet file, the two long strings of text that begin with "xprv".  In the third box, paste the x3/ xpub key.  Then hit ok/next.  On the next screen, you can enter a password if you want.  We don't need to go into this wallet file.
Now you have a regular multisig wallet that you have two of the three keys for, and it won't ask you for your google auth code.  You should be able to send the money to a new wallet.  Let me know if you encounter any problems.

Well that's wrong.  If users don't consider blocks mined by a miner to be valid, nobody but the miner will consider those coins to be worth anything, and the miner is mining coins that nobody uses.  Like it or not, miners are not the only part of the system.

Bitcoin Core can be a full node, but often is not.  You have to enable port forwarding and make sure you accept incoming connections.  THEN your Core will be a full node.  If you only ever max out at 8 connections, you're not a full node.  You *are* validating everything, but you're not relaying transactions or blocks, you're just receiving data from the network without passing it along.
Bitcoin Core is not the only full node.  There are other software available that download and validate the whole blockchain, and relay blocks and transactions, and do everything a full node needs to do.  Bitcoin Core is the most common full node, but it isn't the only one available.

You're making a year be 360 days instead of 365.25 (0.25 for leap years), which adds over 8 months, however, your result is near perfect, which sets the lock to Dec. 16, 2065 at 04:17:26 UTC.  The next thing is that I believe but I'm not 100% sure that locktimes are one of those things that gets its endianness reversed, so your time in hex would need to be 0x56187eb4.  Then, there's no need for the pubkey hash, since everything is being wrapped in a P2SH script anyway.  And finally, you need to add OP_DROP to remove the OP_TRUE from the stack in order to perform the signature check.  So my best guess at the actual P2SH redeem script would be:
    0x56187eb4 OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY OP_DROP {pubkey} OP_CHECKSIG
And then the scriptSig would just be the signature (followed by the redeem script), and the scriptPubKey would be the standard P2SH script of OP_HASH160 {hash} OP_EQUAL, and the hash would be the ripemd160(sha256()) of:
    04 56187eb4 b1 75 {21 02/03-pubkey, or 41 04-pubkey} ac
That would be my best guess if I were making the script to test this out, which I will probably do shortly.  Perhaps somebody who definitely knows how it works can chime in!

What I don't understand is what the leading 0 is and the ending 0/1 is.  Is the leading 0 the extra byte for op_checkmultisig?  If not, what is it?  And what is the 0/1 after the signatures?
Do you have an example signed hex transaction?  That would help me visualize it.

The whole purpose behind Bitcoin is uncensorable transactions.  That means everybody can make one.  If you sent a free transaction, it might take a week or two to get enough priority to get in a Block, but it would eventually.  Adjusting that so it takes longer, because doing so is necessary, is one thing, but this just straight up PREVENTS valid transactions from ever being mined.  Including ones that DO pay a fee, but less than 4 cents per kb.  That blatantly goes against the fundamental purpose and nature of Bitcoin's design.

You don't have to use it.  You can use a client that always makes on blockchain transactions.  The lightning network is simply a ripple-like set of smart contracts, but at any point in time, you can always publish all the contracts you have to the bitcoin network and put it all back on-chain.  (And as mentioned, you don't have to participate in it.)
It's completely optional.  I like it because it *allows* for people who want to to do more off-chain and free up some space.  But I share your frustration and concern that a lot of the main Core developers just completely ignored the will of the community and even went so far as to call discussions about block size increases as being off-topic and "alt coins".  That's of course absurd and completely disingenuous.  And the actions of a good number of them have made me distrust them completely, where I now am very slow to upgrade clients, because I have to read throw the commit diffs on every new version, because I simply don't trust the core maintainer's judgement.  And then I have to go through and manually change a handful the more retarded things they've decided Core should do, like drop all transactions that don't include a fee of at least 2 cents per kb.

My point is just that if all you use is the 6 digit code, then that's all that needs to be cracked.  The fact that it rotates makes running a cracking program not really work, but the point is that at any given time, as a login security feature, it's still only 19 bits of entropy that need to be overcome.  So if for example, a place doesn't lock you out after X tries, you can just churn through numbers at random and get a hit pretty quickly.  The fact that it changes all the time doesn't matter in that regard, it's like proof of work -- you just keep throwing out guesses until you accidentally get a match.

There's a number of ways to think about Bitcoin.  The easiest way is to think of it as a commodity, like gold, but that is on the computer, and even though it's on the computer and can be transfered via the internet, it still has the non-computer property of not being able to be copied.  So when somebody sends you bitcoins, you actually have a real tangible asset, NOT a digital copy of something.
The way that all works, and the reason the commodity Bitcoin has value, is the protocol behind Bitcoin, aka the blockchain.  Bitcoin is not backed by anything -- you can't just go trade them in for dollars or gold.  People *do* trade them for that because they believe Bitcoin has value.  But that value is completely self-derived.
I personally believe that value comes from the usefulness of that blockchain technology and how it works -- the fact that it enables payments and data to be moved without being "copied".  Other people think it's valuable for other reasons, and some people think it's not valuable at all and we're all fools for believing in it.
The difficult thing for understanding Bitcoin in every way but the price/value aspects, is that, in terms of the technology and how it works, everything is all mixed together into one thing, and so it's often difficult to separate them when you're talking about Bitcoin.
As for being safe -- well that depends on how good you are with your security.  People get hacked all the time.  And since Bitcoin is an actual commodity on your computer (that's not technically true, but it's the easiest way to think about it) -- since it's actually on your computer, if you get hacked and lose it, it's really gone.  There's no way to get it back, no government or insurance company that will refund you.  It's just gone.  Some people like to store their money with other people, like exchanges like Coinbase or Bitstamp, and trust that those institutions will not lose them, or at least that they can be sued if they do lose them.  Some people print out the data that represents the Bitcoins onto pieces of paper and then delete the Bitcoin from their computer, so now they have Bitcoin in the physical world, on pieces of paper, protected from computer hacking.
And some other people use a neat optional property of Bitcoin that makes it so multiple people must agree on how the Bitcoin is spent in order for it to move at all, so if any one of them is hacked, the Bitcoin is still safe.
As for it's value... that's just what one person is willing to buy and another is willing to sell for.  There is no "official" value.  The way I determine the "actual" value is I go look at a bunch of exchanges and take the average of the price that people traded it for most recently.  Most recently, that was about $410.
As for buying it, there are government-licensed exchanges like Coinbase and Bitstamp and Gemini, and there are unlicensed exchanges, and there are forums where people just agree to meet and trade in person -- there's pretty much every way you can imagine.  The difficulty most people have is that people who sell Bitcoin will usually not let you use a credit card or Paypal to buy from them.  The reason is really simple -- they buy the Bitcoin, then once they have the Bitcoin, they call their credit card company or e-mail Paypal and say "that wasn't me, that was a hacker or identity thief, please reverse that charge", and the company *does* reverse it, and now the seller is out the Bitcoin and the credit card or paypal payment.  (And often times, it really *was* a hacker that stole their info, and used that to get Bitcoins.)  Bitcoins trades cannot be reversed.  Think of it like using cash on the street -- once you give it to somebody it's gone.  So either the person you trade with, like most in person traders, will only accept cash, or they are big companies/exchanges and require all kinds of identifying documents.
Don't feel bad -- Bitcoin is overwhelming and hard to understand.  And it's hard to get any, and it's hard to learn how it works.  That's all just a function of it still being relatively new.  Watch the videos other people have posted, read forums, keep asking questions, and little by little you'll get more and more knowledgeable.

I completely understand that you have to walk that delicate balance.  But if you are not forcing miners to choose a policy before they are able to mine, then you by definition are deciding those defaults, difficult as they may be to come up with.
I don't disagree that it's a difficult and delicate balance, but I *do* disagree with removing priority altogether.
However, as I mention in my other reply, came up with [an idea]( that allows you to remove defaults completely and not allow miners to mine without setting their own policy, but still have an extremely low barrier to entry for novice miners.  It is basically just make a simple script that asks the miners questions about what they want their policy to be, in layman's terms, and they just enter the numbers they want.  You can even have long explanations about what each policy decision is, how it affects others, etc. etc., so it's easy to understand.  So the first time you run Core, it pops up asking if you're a miner and you would like to set up your mining policy.  Or maybe a menu entry or "setupmining" command to turn on the ability to using mining APIs/commands by setting your policy.
Would that be extremely difficult?  Even if you don't know what balance to strike, do you know all of the factors that miners consider, and can you put those into a script to ask miners to set their policy?

What do you mean "make a transaction"?  What specifically are you trying to do?  pycoin has all of the code necessary to make or verify a transaction, but you'd still have to know how Bitcoin scripting works.  There's also Electrum pybitcointools and a bunch of other libraries that allow you to just put in address info and they'll use rpc or bitcoin-cli or just a web explorer and get the necessary info and make the transaction, so you don't need to know how Bitcoin scripting works.  There's a ton of libraries out there for pretty much anything you need to do.  What exactly are you looking for?

I've explained that to you at least twice already.  This would go faster if you just learned to read.
The merkle root of segwit data is stored in the coinbase transaction.  Non-segwit nodes have no understanding of that and for all they know, it can be removed.
Segwit data is as much a part of a block as Factom data is, or as much as a document that has a proof of existence hash embedded.  There is a *pointer* to the data, but the data itself is not embedded in the block, and as far as nodes know, that pointer is just arbitrary and doesn't mean anything.  So segwit data is as much in the block as Factom data is.... which is "not".  (I don't mean to knock Factom, I think they do awesome stuff... they just happened to be the example I thought of.)

@_date: 2017-02-11 04:07:16


Well, I didn't say that I thought there wasn't enough data, I merely said that it's not unreasonable to come to a conclusion that is different, given the available data.  I actually DO think there is enough data and that it supports my conclusion -- I just agree that it's *possible* to come to a different conclusion without more data that definitely proves things 100%.  But from my analysis, the proof via data is at like 99.999999999%... I just can't in good conscience say it's 100%.
I would agree with you about the conservative approach if the damage caused by waiting weren't so harmful.  Obviously, I don't want to bork the network, and being careful is important.  If there were a way to be conservative while ensuring the needed capacity increases (which segwit does not do, as it still caps future increases), then I would be all for that.  If BIP 100 or 101 or whatever else were still on the table, I'd be all for them too.  (Thankfully, such things can still be soft-forked in later, after a BU hard fork.)
In this case however, the damage done by continuing to let the network stagnate, the damage done is so high and so disastrous that I am think forgoing the conservative route and taking the 99.99999% chance is a worth while risk.


I appreciate that, and I appreciate you coming back and replying to me with a well-reasoned and thoughtful reply, especially after I was so snappy in my previous reply.  So few people actually do want to have a genuine discussion about it, and as may have come through, I was extremely exhausted with -- "trolls" isn't the right word, but people who aren't actually open to a discussion.  Still, it was not appropriate of me to prematurely make that assumption about you, and I apologize for that.
Thank you for the thoughtful reply. I'd be very happy to continue the discussion with you and consider your well-reasoned rebuttals.  It's so rare to actually have a decent conversation these days.  I really am open to the fact that I may be mistaken -- I just haven't found any convincing evidence to show it yet, and the consequences of inaction are so dire.
@_date: 2017-02-11 04:31:09


Remember, that's only for blocks larger than your excessive size setting.  If most of the network has the same settings, that won't be a huge issue.  Even if they don't, it's still only an issue at the very tip of the blockchain.


No, no it doesn't.  Not at all.  The security of a block -- the chance of being orphaned in a re-org, has **always** been probabilistic.  This just lowers the confidence at the very tip.  The system itself is still performing the same basic function.  New blocks with new proofs of work still get built on top of *something*, and a single chain of history still emerges.


We tried that.  I'd still be open to it.  If you proposed a 2mb or 4mb hard fork tomorrow and the whole anti-BU community was onboard, I can guarantee you that the vast majority of the BU community would happily jump on board.  Go convince Core to do 2mb+segwit and you'll have a fork tomorrow.


Well, we're actually on the same side here.  I didn't say I thought frequent changes were *good*, I merely was pointing out that it is wrong to claim that nodes don't need to upgrade more than every few years.
In this specific instance, because it's a hard fork, yes all nodes would need to change quickly.  I agree that that's less desirable, but there's no other way to do a hard fork.  I'm also confident in the network's ability to adapt to any problems that occur as a result.  But yes, generally speaking, I agree with you that staggered updates are better.  For the same reason I think multiple implementations are better.  Many nodes running different versions ensure that if any one set of software malfunctions, the network as a whole doesn't grind to a halt.
@_date: 2017-02-11 03:52:10


Math.  Math proves it.  If there is extra space in a block and no more high-fee-paying transactions in the mempool, the extra marginal cost of adding a lower-fee paying transaction is generally less than even a small fee, so miners include those lower-priority transactions.


The discussion forums, e-mail lists, and IRC channel are the proof.  You are free to read all of that, as the vast majority of it is still online.  It was generally assumed community-wide that this would happen eventually.  It wasn't until ~ late 2014 that the narrative changed to "no this was never supposed to happen".  The thread in which [Satoshi commented]( about the raise is just one such example.  Please, do scour the forums for more evidence.  Do so to your heart's content.

You either have to have a longer window for notice, or you have to make ALL aspects and default settings 1-for-1 backwards compatible.  That's exactly how you roll out changes.  They rolled out as soon as it was signaled.  The correct way was, yes, to have a grace period after signaling.  Not ten years, but not zero years either.
Ugh, I just have a very special dislike for the notion that developers should tell users how they should be using their software.  That's just not how the world operates.  If a user bricks the software, that's not the user's fault, it's the fault of the developer for not making sure that couldn't happen.  Developers developing for developers is not how progress is made.  It's how the first alpha proof of concept is made.  Beta software, and of course stable releases, must adhere to higher standards.

@_date: 2017-02-03 17:28:21
Witness data does no such thing.  As far as how it's in a block, it's an anyone-can-spend always valid transaction.  It is just as "validated" as Factom data as far as non-segwit nodes can see.  Those non-segwit nodes have a full and complete copy of the blockchain, with valid proofs of work, and they *still* can't validate the data, so by what measure are you claiming that segwit data is somehow more valid or more a part of the blockchain than Factom data?
@_date: 2017-02-10 09:43:38
I would strongly disagree that the current system requires upgrades as infrequently as every few years.  If you have multi-year old software and mine a block right now with a transaction that has an invalid checksequenceverify OP code, you're going to be pretty upset you didn't upgrade.  If you're running a full node that accepts that block, you're going to think you have a confirmation before the rest of the network oprhans it and builds on top of a different chain, which to you was a less-work chain.

And my reply to that:
Well let's put that in perspective.  It was opposed because most users and businesses felt the inherent risk in zero conf at the time was acceptable, and making it easier to double spend by putting in RBF -- that changed the acceptable risk threshold for a lot of people.  While I'm sure devs will come shout about how the technical aspects of double spends didn't actually change, the real world risk and threat of double-spends for businesses and users certainly did.  Due primarily to RBF implementation, the acceptance of zero conf transactions by users and businesses has gone down considerably since that time, and most businesses that used to accept them have instead started using third parties like Bitpay.
On top of that, fees have been rising and people are much more likely than previously to accidentally have a "low" fee transaction, because the fee they had two weeks ago suddenly isn't good enough now.
So, with that being the current state of affairs, yes, RBF fee-bumping is getting support because it's an improvement over the current status quo.  But let's not go forgetting just how the current situation came to be.  It's only helping to solve a problem that it helped create to begin with.

No but suddenly throwing a bunch of cars on a road that also has horses on it isn't the right way to introduce cars.  Cars may indeed be better technology but you'll still just end up with a road full of dead horses and people that no one can drive on.

The usefulness of Bitcoin is not in its immediate settlement value.  Zero conf transactions are already too "risky" and yet there are services like Bitpay to fill that void.  Extending that risk to the tip of the blockchain doesn't actually change that security model.
Remember, the whole purpose of Bitcoin is a trust ledger to order transactions in order to prevent double spends... all in an adversarial environment.  That's its usefulness.  The reason people don't like zero conf is because the probability of a double spend is too high in their minds.  That probability is much less, but still non-zero, with 1 confirmation.  All BU is doing here is lowering those probabilities at the tip of the blockchain.  But the fundamental nature of Bitcoin still asserts itself -- that is, the probability of a double-spend still approaches 0% as you get more and more blocks on top of your transaction's block.  The fact that to achieve some arbitrary percentage likelihood takes more blocks doesn't fundamentally alter that.  It just means there's a slightly longer period of time in which confidence is below some threshold.  And as we've already gone over, that time period already exists today with zero conf transactions, and it's not a problem.  Extending it from 10 or 20 minutes to 1 or 2 hours doesn't change much in terms of user experience, or risk.


BU is **not** pointless with everybody having the same EB, because even with the same EB now, there is the possibility of increasing it in the future to accommodate usage and demand.  It's a world of difference.


No, it's not.  We're still just dealing with probabilities of double-spends which collapse towards zero over time/work.


Where did we do the 2MB HF + segwit thing??


You've got the logic incorrect, which is why you think it's stupid.  We tried a reasonable thing and failed.  Now the alternative offered by Core is a seemingly reasonable thing which comes with unreasonable strings attached.  Segwit (reasonable), but with no chance of a blocksize increase in the future (unreasonable).  So while segwit is fine, if we allow it now, we cap the future potential.  I'd rather take the slight risk or BU than the guarantee of future fail (no future blocksize increase).  *That's* the trade-off.


I've had this debate with people before.  Rather than argue once again about how segwit isn't a blocksize increase, I'll simply clarify and explain it HOW WE BOTH KNOW I MEANT, which is a 2mb hard fork of non-segwit "stripped block" size and then also segwit.


You just contradicted yourself without realizing it.  Yes, it is correct to say nodes do not need to upgrade.... if you don't want to ever add any features and value to the protocol.  If you do want to add them, then nodes need to upgrade.  We have been adding them, and nodes have needed to upgrade.


Which is why BU hasn't activated yet.


Then you go against the majority of Core maintainers who think there really should only be the reference implementation and that other implementations are bad and risky because they risk differing from the Core reference implementation.


That is incorrect.  BU in its default state, where the max blocksize to mine is 1mb, is an implementation of Bitcoin.
Additionally, I would argue that if and when it activates and has the majority of miners and community behind it, then it becomes "Bitcoin" since "Bitcoin" is nothing more than what other people call Bitcoin.  Just as what used to be called "Ethereum" is the protocol of what is now referred to as "Ethereum Classic".  Nothing changed, except that people starting calling some new protocol "Ethereum".
"Bitcoin" is whatever the community decides it is.  Language is not created by decree, it is created by common usage.

I did not bookmark them, and I don't care enough to go digging around to find them, but there are a handful of small businesses that posted on reddit and bitcointalk claiming that the increased risk would cause them to have to stop accepting zero confs, which they didn't want to do.
It wasn't tons of businesses, but there were a few.

So the chain will be viable long term.


Correct.  I don't *want* a contentious fork, but I will take one if it's the only way forward.  I would rather have a contentious fork than $500 transaction fees and Bitcoin to become an inter-bank settlement network.


That is what I have done so far.  I can only speak for myself in that regard, not others, but I have done so.  Unfortunately, it often falls on deaf ears, and where the other person does actually accept and use logic, we arrive at the conclusion that there isn't enough data to know for sure, and we each disagree about the likelihood of what that missing data will say about the viability of each of our views.


No, I won't.  Because you've already made up your mind.  I've had the friendly talk a million times already, and (barring the outcome mentioned last paragraph) it always ends with the other guy stating outright that I'm wrong, regardless of the evidence or logic presented.  And it's not possible to use logic against a brick wall like that.

They really can't do that politically.  The whole point of soft forks and high activation thresholds is to make the transition as seamless as possible and not bork the network.  More likely, once it gets to 70%, other miners will jump on board, or the majority will orphan off non-supporting blocks until 95% is reached over a difficulty period.  (I don't think the second option is very likely, but I think it's *more* likely than everybody agreeing on a lower target.)
@_date: 2017-02-10 09:36:17
I don't understand what you are saying.  That there was an average 5% orphan rate network wide, and that Ghash had a lower orphan rate, which is why so many people used them, or that they had a 5% orphan rate, which was worse than the network average, which is why people left them?  If you're claiming the latter, then why did so many people use them right up until they came close to the 50% mark?  Surely you're not saying it's coincidence that they decided to leave at that time, not because of the 50% threat but because of the orphan rate.... ?
@_date: 2017-02-05 23:16:17
They aren't.  Every single node gets to decide for him- or herself what software they run, whether they mine, what rules their node follows, etc.  Nobody decides anything about anyone's node except their own.  You decide what software you run, I decide what software I run.  And when we decide on similar enough software, a single consensus chain emerges.  But your or I are absolutely free to break from that and run our own software and our own chain.  Nobody is forcing you to run anything you don't want.  If BU gains majority hashrate, you are free to run software that only considers the minority chain valid and continue on using only that chain.
There is no coercion or pressure on anybody, it is entirely voluntary.  If you don't want to accept low fee transactions on your software, you do not have to.  Nobody but you gets to decide what burden you bear.  If the BU chain is too burdensome for you, you absolutely do not have to run it.
What you *don't* get to do, is make decisions about what software other people can run.  That is their right to choose, whether you like it or not.

I've also been around since early 2011, and no, no they didn't raise those concerns.  A handful of times it was mentioned, and if anybody was concerned, they certainly didn't pipe up in agreement.  To be fair, I think they were just being silent and letting the can get kicked down the road -- I'm not saying they were definitely *for* a hard fork previously.  But they absolutely weren't speaking out against it in droves like they started doing in late 2014 / early 2015.
@_date: 2017-02-04 15:59:48


On what authority are you claiming that?  As far as they can tell, they absolutely do have the entire blockchain and are validating everything.  I can just tell you that you don't have the complete blockchain, and that a complete one would include Factom data... but you don't care what I say, or what any node says.  You care about your own node, its rules, and its ability to validate based on those rules.  If you're intentionally bricking other clients so they can't validate, and calling your way of doing things "Bitcoin" and their way "the old way", then that's not really a soft fork.
@_date: 2017-02-05 06:16:20
Then don't run a node.  I and others like me will pick up the slack of your laziness, and be happy to do so to support the network and ensure that those in need have access to it.

P2Sh redeem scripts must be in the scriptsig and match the txin's output hash.  And all of the data required to verify them is in the spending transaction.  They do not require any external data.
@_date: 2017-02-04 23:15:09
Yes, but they still have all the data available.  Any node that wants to change the validation rules can still request from them a copy of the blockchain and independently validate it himself based on his different rules.  The key there is that the blockchain is the same discrete dataset and they both can validate it according to their own rules.
Adding a whole different set of data in that other nodes have no access to is an entirely different type of change.

In fact it does include that!  The problem I frequently encounter is that the people I am explaining things to aren't well-enough versed in logic to understand what is logically sound and what isn't.  This means logic is ineffective as a tool of persuasion for them, as it has been for you in our discussions.  That's not something I know how to counter, unfortunately.  When logic and data fail, the discussion is just basically over.


Until RBF was introduced, the reference client and most other clients treated the first seen transaction as standard and any later double-spends as non-standard.  That was an effective enough buffer for most of the economic users.  Again, you are arguing the technical side (it doesn't count until it's in a block), and I am arguing to real world usage (the likelihood of being confirmed soon is some percent, and I as a business can work within that risk tolerance).  Your view is not incorrect, but nor is mine.  Nor is the point I previously made about the utility of the second view for businesses.

In order to prove to you that I am not just not clueless, but actually capable and qualified, YOU would have to also be capable and qualified and know enough to judge any examples of my knowledge which I provide.  I was working on the assumption that you weren't so qualified and thus defaulted to the evidence that I'm not completely clueless, which does not require your expertise.

This is incorrect.  It *is* significantly different.  The tx fee you pay goes to supporting the distributed network.  The entities in which you place your trust are able to be chosen by you.  The risk of errors, and how arbitration is handled, is completely different.
It may not be trust-less, but it is absolutely still a significant departure from a centralized service like Paypal.

That's not "broken", that's just how it works.  Yes, there will be more re-orgs at the tip of the blockchain.  That's a well-known property of what it does.
You have to prove that that's *damaging* in order to say that BU is broken.  Right now, all you've done is link to articles explaining what it does and *proclaiming* that doing things that way is bad, without evidence or reason to back it up.
Yes, 2 confs will be less secure than it is now.  There will be more orphans at the tip.  It might take 1 hour to reach the same level of security that now takes 20 minutes.  IMO that's a small price to pay for the numerous advantages.

I think I at least am getting to understand the core of your concerns.  I'm not particularly worried about them, because I think the tradeoff is better.  The higher difficulty makes a number of attacks harder, and the slight increased risk of random occasional short forks due to invalid blocks does not in my opinion outweigh the benefits.  The whole rest of the full-node network validates the blocks that miners send, so there's a definite balance to be had, where miners take certain risks of losing their reward depending on how often they don't validate blocks.  I view it as the network "working itself out".  Everybody is acting in their own interest.  Miners aren't doing 100% validation, but all the other users are.  In turn the users benefit from the security provided by the increased mining difficulty, but they just have to double-check the miner's work.  And as I said, I think the system as a whole is more secure with that setup than they would be with 100% validated mining, for all the reasons I mentioned in earlier posts.
So I get what you're saying, but I'm not too worried about it.
@_date: 2017-02-09 07:22:04

@_date: 2017-02-03 01:03:51
Yes.  Miners get to choose what they mine, and users and businesses and other economic actors get to choose what blocks and coins they consider valid.  When all of the players involved agree, the network "emerges".  My point was that your complaint about Chinese miners wasn't particularly valid -- that is, you don't get to decide who mines, whether they have a monopoly, or what type of blocks they mine.  All you control is.... what you control.  You are free to not accept their blocks, or to mine yourself, or to do any number of other things.  What you don't get to do, is tell other people how they should be mining.  That's up to them.

Yes, Bitcoin's value comes from censorship resistance and having a trusted ledger in a trust-less environment, which is currently achieved via decentralization.  Some of us just think that those things won't get screwed by bigger blocks.  Some of us think the people and technology are capable of adapting, and if problems arise, they will be dealt with.  Like when Ghash.io go to 45%, miners left them in droves *and* they self-limited their hashrate.
Some of us simply have confidence in the ability of the network to adapt, because everybody knows what the value proposition is, and they have a financial interest in maintaining that value, and thus they will expend effort to reinforce and defend those values when they get threatened.  Some of us just don't think the world will end if we get bigger blocks.

I'm sorry but it's simply ridiculous to claim that it doesn't matter how new technology is introduced and that any harm caused by the method of transition is irrelevant.  That's lunacy.  The whole purpose of technology is to improve the human condition.  If you can move to better technology without doing harm, that's obviously better than a transition that does do harm (all else being equal).  It's just crazy to claim that the ends justify the means when there are better means to achieve the same ends.

The signaling is done in the transaction itself.  RBF is set by having a non-max sequence number on all inputs.
The reason it caused issues is because there wasn't any good wallet software to alert people of it -- I mean, in terms of actual merchant applications that real people were using.  Sure you could look at the transaction and see the sequence number, but the vast majority of people don't know how to do that.
Additionally, it created unknown risk -- just because a transaction is RBF, that doesn't mean the user intends to double-spend.  It might just be a wallet default, or the user wanting to make sure it doesn't get stuck... or it might be a user intending to double-spend.  The risk associated with RBF transactions simply wasn't known and businesses couldn't accurately guage how it would change the likelihood of double-spends.  This meant they couldn't quantify their risk, which meant they could no longer accept such transactions and had to wait for a confirmation, since the risk on one confirmation of course didn't change.
It's not that RBF is bad -- in theory, it's good.  But being good technically and being useful in the real world are two different things.  A marginal technical improvement that bricks real world actual usage is *not* an improvement.  It needs to be phased in slowly so as to not disrupt how real people are actually using the software.  Much like how segwit is getting the userspace software designed and ready by most businesses *before* it's being implemented.  (I have other issues with segwit, but development of user and merchant applications around it is not one of them.)

I'm not a developer, but I am an okay (but not great programmer), and I'm good enough, and enthusiastic enough about Bitcoin, that I know how it works inside and out... for the most part.  Maybe not some of the deeper issues relating to implementation and memory problems and stuff like that, but I understand conceptually how it works at every step of the way.
But that doesn't particularly help in a lot of these discussions, because a lot of this is economics and incentives and predicting behaviour, which is not a programming problem.  And frankly, this is a large part of the problem in the debate.  A lot of the devs are making very specific *economic* claims that simply aren't backed up by data or are actively contradicted by data.  In short they are stating "In theory, practice and theory are the same." without regard for the real world.
Don't get me wrong, people who are programming and crypto experts are smarter than the average bear, but when they make claims about centralization and how nodes will react and who will run full nodes and so on.... those are *economic* statements that they have right to claim any special knowledge about.  They aren't experts on those topics.  And a lot of them make straight up logical errors in their claims as well.
Additionally, the reasons given for many of the claims about bandwidth and other capacity issues, specifically in regards to China, are educated guesses without a lot of hard data.
Again, don't get me wrong, they are smart people.  But whenever you hear a claim, try to think about it logically.  Try to do what you and I did here -- go back and forth, play Devil's Advocate against yourself.  Try to actually come up with a logical and evidentiary basis for each side.  Ask questions and gather data.  A smart person who is right 90% of the time will be wrong 100 times if he makes a thousand claims.
So just be careful about blindly taking devs' word for things.  The best thing you can do is continue learning how Bitcoin works, and try to train yourself to be as logical as possible.  Those two things will give you the best chance to make a good and informed conclusion about the arguments being presented to you.

A majority of miners can already steal any coins they want.  They can go back in time and start mining on top of any block prior to whatever transaction they wish to undo.  Since coins originate in the coinbase generation transaction, this means they can go back prior to the origin of any coin and re-mine that block to pay themselves instead.

This is actually a good thing.  Suppose one version ends up having a bug?  You want people running different clients and different versions.  Slowly, the old ones will eventually die off or upgrade and the "new" changes will slowly get rolled out.  That's how it's supposed to be.  That's a good thing, it protects the system.  Here's a list of clients connected to me.  Now imagine there's a bug in one of them.  With so many different clients, the whole system isn't brought down.

No, he realized if the blocksize is disproportionately larger than the volume of transactions, it's cheap to continuously spam the network.  The intention was to raise the blocksize as blocks filled up, so that there would still be enough room for all normal transactions, but somebody suddenly shipping out say 10x the normal volume of transactions couldn't flood the network.  It was always planned that the blocksize would increase so that Bitcoin could scale.


As mentioned, no, I didn't just suddenly come alone.  This was always assumed to be something that was going to happen, until late 2014 or so, when the narrative was changed.
Additionally, no trust is me or anybody else is required.  You don't have to accept my chain.  Nobody is forcing you to use the software.


Yeah, better for you.  Not for all the other people who want to use Bitcoin but can't.

I categorize that reply as I did in my original post:  *"While I'm sure devs will come shout about how the technical aspects of double spends didn't actually change, the real world risk and threat of double-spends for businesses and users certainly did."*
The reality is that the wallet software merchants and users were using at the time didn't show them sequence numbers or give them info about the transaction.  And RBF made it *easier* for users to double-spend transactions -- even if only for transactions clearly marked as such.  Given that merchants didn't have the ability to see sequence numbers, the *real world effect* on them was a higher chance of double-spends.  Because they lacked the technical ability to sort out which transactions were RBF and which weren't, as well as how likely it was RBF transactions would get double-spent.
That is quantifiable, increased risk if you're a merchant.  The argument of "well nothing technically changed, you could always get double-spent" doesn't matter.  What matters is the actual percentage risk of a double-spend for that merchant using the software he has.
Do you see the difference there?
I actually like RBF.  It does solve a real problem, and all your points about the benefits of it are true.  My complaint is how it was rolled out, and how the lack of available user and merchant software for it lead to higher *real world* risk for users and merchants.  If RBF was rolled out slower, I'd have been all for it.
You're focusing on the technical difficulty of double-spending, which was, as you rightly point out, unchanged.  I'm talking about the real world risk to merchants and users, which absolutely DOES change when you make it easier for users to double-spend, even if technically they could do it all along.
It really is a classic case of developers developing for developers.

You'll need a client that allows you to double-spend unconfirmed spends, or you need to know how to create the transaction manually.
Here is the unsigned transaction but with a fee added.  You'll need to lookup how to sign it manually with Bitcoin Core:
    01000000046e33aff6c2ba72481403425904496685320fb7317dd15ae1cbf36f426b1f7a840100000000ffffffff9dbfd3371c09537cd8adf09092f092ef8ed82e6fa813e362ea4122554b9f3a150000000000ffffffffb9a888f3dabe3df90e02d1d53b81696eb551e0dc709501b135dd9bcd3a3799760000000000ffffffff392a9be0fb4f759b78c4953ce6bc54f42c10274fd390a50a3e8311817a7f4d620000000000ffffffff0240c49a010000000017a914f06868b7e9e9e3473222b16b2e7ad85ff64dd8eb8759340100000000001976a9141ea91c511bd9902f97da0090a85d11ac327723a388ac00000000
And here is that very same transaction, represented a little differently (the unsigned inputs have the scriptpubkey instead of null), so that you can use a site like Coinb.in or soemthing to sign it:
    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
Once, you've signed it, you'll need to broadcast it.  Just post another reply to me here if you need help doing that, or if you need help signing it, and I can walk you through it.

You're confused.  Math requires no further proof.  As long as you accept the base axioms of mathematics, the rest is derived by logic.  No further proof is required.


Once again, you're confused.  I offered up the entire bitcointalk forum history as proof, and even cited one such thread about raising the block size, in which multiple lead developers and the creator, all agreed that the blocksize should be raised at some point in the future.
If you don't accept the evidence of math and data, there's really no method of proof I can provide that will satisfy you.  But that is not a failing on my part.

Yes Gavin did "trash" Luke in that thread.  That's the only time I've ever seen Gavin without a cool head, and in my view, he's completely right in that case.  But I'll give it to you, yes, Gavin wasn't nice that one time 4 years ago.  You can even call that "disgusting" if you want.  But nothing he said was a lie, and that's the *only* time Gavin has had an uncool head in the history of his involvement with Bitcoin.  Luke on the other hand has been disingenuous and lying pretty much every day.  And the point of my post was that when you stack Gavin up against *every single other Bitcoin developer*, he is **by a wide margin** the most respectful and cool-headed.
Are you seriously stacking up all the shit other devs have done against the one time Gavin lost his level-headedness?

Miners are NOT also nodes.  All you need to mine is a block header.  Most miners actually do NOT run full nodes.  They connect to a pool operater who sends them a mining template.  You don't need to run a node to mine.


That's just not true.  They must validate that what the miners do is valid, otherwise miners can just give themselves free money and nobody will check them.  Non-mining full nodes validate that the miners are acting correctly, and they serve as a firewall for invalid blocks and other malicious or incorrect behavior from miners.  The miners are kept in check by the fact that their invalid extra coins they mine won't get relayed to anybody and won't be able to be spent.  Without validating full nodes, miners could collude to make extra money.


That is the *incentive*.  The selfish reason that provides incentive for people to run nodes, which then provides the communal benefit I mentioned in the previous paragraph.
Bitcoin is built on an incentive system.  When all users act in their own self interest, the system magically works with various checks and balances.  And collusion only breaks the system if it's a significant chunk of the network.  Individual and small group cheating is simply a waste and doesn't work.  This is one of the many things that makes Bitcoin awesome.


Which is another reason I don't understand many devs' fears about node centralization with a slight block size increase.  There's *incentive* for businesses to run full nodes.

No, you aren't.  That's not the point.  The point is you thought you were running software that acted in one way when it acted in another way.  If Core added in a virus, would you say, "well you aren't forced to run it"?  No, of course not.  You expect software to work a certain way, and to be notified when the way it operates changes.  Luke added in a malicious change and didn't tell people.  Just because you aren't forced to use his software doesn't make that action of his less shitty.

We have that, it's called First Seen Safe Replace By Fee.  It makes it so that your node forwards double-spends only if the same inputs and outputs are included in the transaction.  (You add more inputs and outputs to cover the fee and your new change.)  It wasn't implemented because certain devs didn't want to encourage using 0-conf tx's...

That's an interesting point about the mining hardware, because I have the exact opposite feeling.  I'm not worried about it remotely.  It looks to me exactly like early computers did -- very few of them, only a few manufacturers for the big ones, and only the very few speciality institutions had them.  But they inevitably trickled down as hardware got cheaper and more widespread and now everybody and his mother has a computer or two, or ten, in his home.  Your toaster might already be a computer.
I see no reason to think that mining hardware won't trickle down like that, if Bitcoin gets popular enough and companies decide it's worth while to build a heat blanket or lightbulb or toaster that's also mining Bitcoin.
I could be wrong, but I'm not worried about it.  Another reason I don't worry is that I know the community reacts swiftly when immediate threats arise.  The 0.7/0.8 fork was resolved in a few hours.  When Ghash.io reached critical levels, miners immediately moved to other pools.
It might take a kick in the butt, but when the kick in the butt happens, the community reacts fast.

If you want to use coinbase but avoid it because they control the money, you can setup a self-managed multisig vault, and have that be the wallet that funds are automatically put into.  That way you have a 2-of-3 address that you have two keys for and they only have one key for -- so in terms of control, it's totally in your control.
@_date: 2016-01-19 18:04:51


It actually does mean that.  The two are not compatible, so any exchanges and merchant services will be using the economic majority chain, and lay users will only ever be using 2mb and not know about the schism.  There will not be multiple competing chains for any lengthy amount of time -- one chain will gather momentum and be "the" chain fairly quickly.  It does nobody any good for there to be confusion for any length of time, so the switch over will be exponential.  It might be slow to get going but once it gets ~70% and appears to keep rising, the rest will quickly follow out of pragmatism.


I can understand why you worry about catastrophic consequences, but I don't think it's going to end up being the confusing mess you seem to think it will be.

Not necessarily.  It may also be that users who did not previously run nodes decided to start running some.  Or any number of other possibilities.  All the data says is there's a whole bunch of new nodes.

This is a false dichotomy presented by many devs, and it has no evidence to back it up.  They keep claiming that a high enough volume to enable microtransactions would consume so much resources that the number of nodes would drop to prohibitively low levels, but there's no evidence to support that.  The only evidence is that the number of nodes has been slowly dropping over time, but there's no data on why that's happening, or on how many nodes is "centralized".  It's a false dilemma.  There are plenty of people like myself who will run nodes even if I have to pay a bit every month, just to participate and keep the network going.  If Luke-jr can't run a node on his graphing caluclator with his 10 kbps connection, that's not some huge problem for decentralization.

No, it's predicting a common and wrong counter-argument.  You of all people should know, I've been having these types of discussions for years, and I am very good at playing Devil's Advocate against myself.  That's how I attempt to arrive at the truth, by trying to find the flaws in my own argument.
In this case, it wasn't a flaw in my argument, but a common flawed counter-argument that I could predict simply through experience.  The flaw being "because something has always been technically possible, making it *easier* has no effect".  That's not a true statement, but it is one frequently uttered by developers.  It was also easy to predict that it would be brought up.

Transaction malleability is a very easy fix.  It's a soft fork enforcement of low-S signatures and minimum possible var-int values when using op_pushdata codes.  If you want to argue the merits of segwit, that's great, but tx malleability should not be part of that argument.  The sheer magnitude of change segwit offers should NOT be rolled in in order to fix something that is very easily fixed in a much easier way.  The sole benefit of segwit is that it's a hack which allows more transactions per block because those transactions are smaller because the signature data is moved to non-block data stores.  Which is a terrible idea, as I've already outlined [here](

You're confused.  "Violent" in the sense I meant it was a synonym for "messy".  The whole Bitcoin ecosystem is still entirely voluntary.  You do not have to use the chain that I use when I hard fork.  Just as I have no obligation to use your chain with small blocks.
You do actual victims a great disservice by conflating my analogy with real oppression.  Especially when it is your own unwillingness to change that has created the very situation you're complaining about.  It's mere icing on the cake that my stance of "I'm going to run software that does what I want it to do" is considered oppressive by you, and that you trying to force one implementation on me is "protecting the network".

Nodes can reject blocks as invalid.  If that happens, miners will be on a different fork than the nodes.  The miners have to have users who use their blocks in order to be able to spend the coins they mint.  If nobody uses the chain they're on, it's useless to them.

Ouch, that's a classic case of forgetting the change output.  Somebody was learning to make transactions manually the expensive way.

@_date: 2016-01-30 02:27:39
It's sort of how the network runs.  Your full node has what is called the mempool -- aka the pool of unconfirmed transactions sitting in memory.  Eventually, the transaction will be likely be pruned from there by your client to make room for other transactions, unless you have manually altered it to keep all transactions (which would bloat your RAM).  So after a few days, if your transaction still isn't in a block, you can safely assume that the vast majority of miners have dropped it and moved on and you can act as if the money was never sent in the first place.
However, past default behavior of most clients was that if you tried to double-spend a transaction that was still in the mempool, it would be dropped right away, in order to try to prevent double spend attacks.  With RBF, if the new double-spend transaction has a high priority and the old transaction has low priority, then the new transaction won't be dropped, and because it has high priority (due to fees), it will more likely be mined soon, thus invalidating the old transaction.
It's been a while since I looked at RBF, so I might have some of that wrong, but that's the gist of it.  Additionally, I believe, but am not sure, that bitcoin days destroyed (coin age \* amount) used to be but is no longer a measurement that goes into calculating transaction priority.  What this means is that you used to be able to wait a while and then re-broadcast your old transaction and it would eventually get high priority because it's older, but that's no longer the case.  Only the fees matter.  (Again, I'm not 100% confident in my info.)
Edit:  Actually, I think the new behavior only works if the old transaction has a non-max sequence number.  This allows the recipient to know right away if the transaction is likely to be double-spent.

It will only confuse people if a significant chunk of people don't use the 2mb fork.  If 99% of people use 2mb, then it won't be confusing.  2mb will be "bitcoin" and anybody who doesn't use 2mb will not be using bitcoin.

That's not how it works.  The software is open source, and users can run whatever software they want.  There's no "taking control of the protocol".  There's "I agree with this change so I'll run software to support it, but if they fuck it up in the future, I'm not going to run that software.

A lot of people are claiming that BU is in favor of sacrificing decentralization in favor of adoption.  I am in favor of BU and do not at all share that view.  If I thought BU threatened decentralization, I would not support it.  I have simply run the numbers myself and believe that the Bitcoin network can support bigger blocks, right now, without significantly harming decentralization.  That is why I support it.  And while I don't mind segwit, the reason I am "against" it currently is because I believe that if segwit activates without a hard fork blocksize increase, then politically, it will be impossible to ever do a hard fork in the future.  It will be the nail in the coffin as far as future upgrades go.  So even though it's not bad code in and of itself, I can't support it in the current climate.
I want to reiterate though that I also value decentralization, since that's the defining property of Bitcoin that keeps it trustless and makes it different from the Paypals and Visas of the world.  I just don't think a blocksize increase hurts decentralization as much as most pro-segwit people seem to think it will.
So with that in mind, my best explanation of both camps is this:
Segwit:  Immediate onchain scaling now, with lots of fixes and improvements, and code that enables secure off-chain scaling like LN relatively soon.  Done as a soft fork, so not as dangerous and doesn't brick old nodes, while providing a good solid capacity upgrade and a sound layout for future upgrades.
(I disagree with a lot of that, but I think that's about how they would view themselves.)
Me/BU:  On-chain scaling right now, and with a flexible community-chosen blocksize that can adapt to future needs.  Hard disk space and bandwidth and computing power are enough to handle pretty major upgrades, and will continue to get better in the future, allowing future on-chain scaling upgrades as well.  This allows more users to use Bitcoin, with lower fees, which enabled adoption by more people and by poorer people, and allows Bitcoin to truly help those in need, by being the peer-to-peer cash system it was designed to be.  Sure Luke-jr can't run a node on his graphing calculator, but plenty of people still can run nodes, even from home, and that slight increase in the cost of running a node enables the whole world to take advantage of what Bitcoin offers.  (There are also a lot of anti-segwit people, not me but others, who don't like segwit in principle, because they don't like the idea of actively trying to move transactions off-chain.  But of course the pro-segwit crowd thinks it's ludicrous to try to have all the world's transaction on-chain.  They say: Think of how big the blockchain will get!)
Pros/cons:   Pro-segwit people think that the BU people will harm decentralization and threaten Bitcoin's very being by irreparably fucking up decentralization and public confidence.  Many of them also seem to think that the block size limit is a scarcity aspect of Bitcoin like the 21 million coin limit, and that a hard fork threatens Bitcoin by showing that any aspect, including the 21 million limit, might be changed at the whims of the community.  The BU people think that's nonsense and argue that nobody would ever go along with changing the coin limit, and that block size was never intended to be part of the scarcity aspect of Bitcoin.  And of course, pro-BU people don't think bigger blocks will really hurt decentralization and we think the risk of the proposed attacks is not nearly as high, or as disastrous, as the pro-segwit group thinks it is.  We're pretty confident the world won't end.
There you have it.  That's the best I can give you.  I believe I have summed up both sides reasonably well and been fair to both side's views.  I fall on the pro-BU side, and I also think this sub is obviously being censored and am quite upset with the mods about that, which is a whole 'nother conversation.  But there you have it, all you need to know about what both sides think and why they think it.

That actually doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter *why* the re-org happens, because all that matters is **that it happens** and how miners and other nodes deal with it.  "Why" doesn't matter.  "Why" doesn't provide any quantifiable actionable change in how to deal with it.  A re-org is a re-org is a re-org.  They're all the same, regardless of why they happened.


First, please do provide your math or sources, I'd love to see your numbers.
Second, I would also love to have more peer review.  If the current climate was "yes, let's integrate BU after a year of testing it on testnet, and have a concrete plan to hard fork if there aren't any problems, and hey we can always soft fork back to 1mb if there are problems" -- if that was the plan, I'd be all for it.  But the plan is "fuck everybody else, I got mine, the blocksize is staying at 1mb".
And in *that* climate, I'm willing to take more of a risk, because the consequences of staying stagnant are a *guarantee of failure* versus a mere *risk* of one.  Now that said, I've run the numbers myself and have personally concluded that most of the arguments and worries about BU don't hold water.  Additionally, I'm confident in the community's ability to tackle immediate disastrous threats.  So in addition to being willing to take more risk to make sure the needed change gets done, I also perceive the risk to be less than you might.


Only in a strict and narrow sense:  it takes slightly more hash power to achieve the same level of protection, because more miners will be orphaned in the more frequent re-orgs.  But that's a linear and proportional decrease, and not nearly bad enough to make it *insecure* by any definition.  It's like comparing Bitcoin's security now to what it was six months ago.  Once blocks get sufficiently deep, a few times the average network AD, it's basically just as secure.  It just takes say 110 blocks to get the security of 100 blocks of current Bitcoin.  And 1010 to get 1000.  It's not *that* much worse.  And the benefit you get in trade is that more people get to use and benefit from Bitcoin.

You're confused about how context works.  If somebody quoted me as saying "black people are apes", it comes off different than the full quote was "black people are apes, white people are apes, racism makes no sense".
See how that works?  You cherry-pick a specific part of a quote to give a **misleading** idea about what the person said *and meant*.


Uhhhh, whether or not a piece of software is going to do what you want it to do is absolutely relevant to users of that software.  How do you think that's not relevant?


No, there's not anything misleading about pointing out a programmers viewpoint on something.  What's misleading is cherry-picking one snippet of their view to purposefully give the wrong impression of either that view or the actions a person might take based on that view.
I have to say, I genuinely thought you were just being annoying or trolling, but if you truly don't understand context and how it works, and why cherry-picking quotes can be misleading, that's actually a serious problem and I'd advise you to consult a doctor.  In all seriousness, it's a pretty important skill to have in order to function in day to day life, and not having any clue about context and situational awareness is a very serious problem that you should address.  (Assuming it's a real problem and you're not just trolling or otherwise being difficult on purpose.)

Not really, it just requires that users change their confidence in 1 or 2 confirmations, since tip re-orgs may be more frequent.  Lite client and other wallet software still works as it always has.  I suppose lite wallet programmers could write dynamicly adjusting confidence updates based on recent block sizes and the advertized acceptance depths, but that's not necessary, they'll still function fine working as they do now.  But "lite" users will not need to participate any more than they do now, they'll just need to wait a few more blocks for the same level of security that they get now from one or two confirmations.  That sucks to be sure, but it's a worth-while trade-off to bring Bitcoin to everybody who needs it.




My claim wasn't that soft forks with 95% activation thresholds were dangerous, my claim was that nodes definitely do need to be upgraded more frequently than every few years.

The problem is you're defining scaling differently than the guy you're replying to is defining it.  By your definition, scaling discussion is allowed, because the things you consider scaling are allowed to be discussed.  By his definition, they aren't, because things he considers options for scaling are not allowed to be discussed.

I do not need to mine 1/200 of the total hashing power, that's a ludicrously high amount.
And the only price that goes up as Bitcoin gets older is disk space needed.
I have my 6 year old desktop and a few years old 1tb hard drive working as a combo Bitcoin server and general usage home/backup server.  I mine with a 2TH miner on it, and I run a plex server on it, as well as a IPFS node and tor relay node.
The extra costs I incur are a little more electricity, and eventually I'll have to replace/upgrade my home server.  I can manage that cost.
Not everybody mines for profit.  I also try to get at least a 2.0 ratio seeding after I download a torrent.  God help me, I want to support the systems I use.  I guess I am just an insane crazy person burning money left, right and center.

Your anger, derision, and personal attacks do not a sound argument make.
Still, I will put them aside and respond to the coherent and logically valid points you have attempted to make.


That is absolutely true!  However, it fails to take into account a lot of how the world operates.  Users generally trust developers.  You don't read all the source code of every application you install, do you?  No, just as with your car mechanic and electrician, you do some research about who you think it is acceptable to place your trust in, and you delegate tasks out to those people.  So as a user, you find a developer who has a history of good work, and you trust them to continue with that good work.  If you happen to be good at the task, you may read the code and do the work yourself, but for the 99% of other users, they have to choose somebody else they trust, since they aren't capable of that.
Now consider what happens when a developer does something a large portion of users don't like... now those users have to find some other developer they trust.  The community gets split, the project forks, each side has software they like, and the world moves on.
That's at least how it works with normal software.  But that's not how things work in the Bitcoin world.  In the Bitcoin world, things operate fundamentally differently.  Miners get to decide what changes are adopted, and users don't get to veto that with different software unless it's done en masse.  The convergent consensus model of Bitcoin means that any user or miner or anybody else is actively harmed by his unilateral deviation from the norm.  That's good for maintaining consensus, but it's bad for progress.  It's also bad if the developers and miners want a change, but the wider users and economic community does not.  Because then the change gets rolled in, and the game theory effects of consensus prevent users from undoing it.  Just like how a miner will still build on top of a valid block that he disapproves of because he knows he will be at a disadvantage if he orphans it -- in that same nash equilibrium vein, users can't just ignore the miners' will unless they know for sure all other users will too.
So while in theory you are right that users get to decide what software they run, Bitcoin is special with regards to the fact that reverting changes fundamentally breaks the system, and so users really can't opt out of those changes.  That is, undoing a soft fork would require a hard fork.
This means that any changes which go in, are pretty much there for good.  For that reason, the vast majority of changes go through a very solid vetting process and the whole community knows they are coming, and the soft fork process goes rather smoothly.  Checklocktime and checksequence are examples of that.  But it is possible for changes that only miners like, or only develoepers like, to find their way in as well, due to the economics and game theory of how Bitcoin works.  Miners will not orphan other miners' valid blocks, even if they disagree with them.  Users cannot choose to use different software, because then they are forked off the network.
With Bitcoin specifically, users really can't just decide to go use different software.
Which brings us back to my original point:  Knowing that users can't really switch software, and pushing out changes that will harm users, is indeed an irresponsible method of rolling out changes.


You will learn nothing if you keep letting anger consume you.  Focus on the merits of my words.  It doesn't matter what you think of me personally.  Either my words are logically sound or they aren't.  Either way, it behooves you to put aside your rage, so that you may attempt to determine what is actually true with unclouded eyes.
I don't care if you don't like me.  I *care* if you understand my argument, and I *care* if my argument is correct.

I like how we're slowly changing the narrative of Bitcoin.  It used to be an awesome technology that enabled world-wide free transacitons micropayments.  Now it's cheap-ish transactions and no micropayments.  A lot of devs are talking about it only being a settlement network.
Instead of growth, we get rising fees and fewer use-cases.  Go Bitcoin!

It was not documented until after it was found and pointed out.  Then it was documented and defaulted to off.

You're confused about how logic works.  There is no "my" logic.  Just as there is no Japanese math or Arab physics.  Logic is logic.  If there is fault in my logic, please do feel free to correct it.
The problem I was pointing out in the post you replied to was that you and many others don't actually know logic very well, and so you make mistakes that you don't see or understand.  Just as if I was explaining a calculus equation to you and you simply didn't know calculus yet.  So when I keep saying "no you're wrong", I'm not just plugging my ears going "la la la not listening".  It's just that I've already explained to you multiple times *why* you're wrong, and you've failed to grasp it.  There is no recourse left for me if you don't understand what is wrong and why.


That doesn't matter.  Do you understand *why* that doesn't matter?  It was removed, and thus for most of Bitcoin's early life, the reference implementation did not have it.  And everything worked swimmingly.  Do you understand that your argument is an appeal to authority, and does not actually address the pros and cons of RBF?


This was still while Bitcoin had a market cap of billions.  Yeah, it's an order of magnitude higher now, but your implicit claim, which you have no evidence for, is that had been implemented, Bitcoin would not have grown to where it is now.  Do you understand why that statement is implicit in your claim?  And do you understand why it is correct for me to point out that you have no evidential or logical basis for such a claim?


That's simply incorrect.  My logic was that businesses were **aware** of those risks and chose to accept them.  They were not being lied to.  They knew the risk of double-spends was there.  They just chose to accept the risk based on the frequency of double-spends **actually occuring**.  RBF changed that frequency by making it easier to do, which in turn created an unacceptably high risk.
Are you following that chain of logic?  Do you see how I went from A to B to C?


Once again, you're confused.  The BU crowd are for block size limits, they just want them to be self-enforced by the community.  They recognize that current hardware and infrastructure can't handle, for example, 1GB blocks right now.  But by allowing community consensus on that size, it allows the blocksize to be raised as hardware and infrastructure come up to speed.  It is a smoother process than having to hard fork every few years.  And it's certainly preferable to having a small cap which prices users out indefinitely.
Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of good arguments to be made against BU.  The issue you and I are having is that you haven't brought any of them up, because you don't understand what's being proposed, nor are you capable of basic logic.  That's why we keep going around in these circles.  If you would study logic, and then attempt to refute my words with logic and data, this whole thread would be over very quickly!  Either one of us would be proved right, or we would conclude that there wasn't enough data to support either side, and both could potentially be right.  So far, in my debates with people who do understand logic, that is the conclusion that has always happened, which makes sense.
I only wish you took the care to be able to defend your own position like that.  But I suppose it's not a surprise, since you don't even think you have an issue.  This is very reminiscent of arguments I used to have with religious folks.  There is no logical baseline from which we can work.

Assuming you're willing to trust me and trust coinbin, go [here]( and copy and paste the second transaction text from my previous post into the bottom text box on that link, and copy and paste your private key for your address into the top textbox of the link and then hit the submit button.  It will give you a set of text that looks similar, but is in fact very different -- it is a *signed* transaction now.  Your private key has been used to digitally sign it.  So copy that text and then paste it [here]( and coinbin will broadcast it to the network, or if you want to paste it in a reply, I can broadcast it from my node.
The transaction you are broadcasting is the same as your transaction above, except instead of sending yourself back 0.00088937 in change, you're sending yourself 0.00078937 and paying a miner fee of 0.0001.
If you need help locating your private key, let me know what Bitcoin software you are using and I will walk you through how to find it.

The blocksize issue has nothing to do with programming or cryptography.  It may use those things in implementation, but the philosophical discussion surrounding the issue is entirely social and economic.

I took your original transaction, and changed it so that instead of paying yourself 0.00088937 in change, you receive 0.00078937 in change and pay a miner fee of 0.0001.  That will get it mined soon.  Because I altered the transaction, the digital signatures are now invalid, so I took them out too.  The result is this new unsigned transaction.  You will need to use your private key to sign it and then re-broadcast it to the Bitcoin network (see my other post).
@_date: 2016-01-18 23:18:46
The "there" I was referencing was that we are "there" in terms of it being obvious that increasing the blocksize is necessary and that doing so requries a hard fork.  Using segwit as that fork is NOT the "there" I was referring to.  I agree with you that segwit is not ready to be used.  I don't think we should use it.  I think BIP101 should be used and segwit should be off the table completely.
And maybe you can explain to me why fixing malleability is so often tauted as the great thing segwit does.  Surely the added complexity of segwit should be put behind a more simple soft fork of BIP66 enforcement if your goal is to fix malleability.
BIP101+BIP66 = DONE.  And we have working code for both already.


That's demonstrably not true.  Deliberation has produced little in the way of results, and the block size increase hard fork is reasonably well understood.  The fact that there's no data on it will *always be true until it is implemented*.  You can't just keep citing that as a reason that it's unknown.  That's circular logic.
@_date: 2016-01-18 09:29:19


That's a fair point, and Peter Todd makes fine arguments, and if segwit could be done in a manner that didn't downgrade the security of non-upgraded nodes, I'd be all for it.  I just don't see *how* a blocksize increase can be done in a soft fork in a way that maintains the overall integrity of the network (see my rant against segwit [here]( so because of that and because I think a blocksize increase is indeed necessary, the conclusion I draw is that a hard fork is the lesser of two evils.

That is incorrect.  Developers don't get to decide how users use their software.  Users get to decide that.  Bricking ways which users use the software because you don't think they should be using it that way is irresponsible.


Yes, but if there is a table in a locked room that people common leave their cash one because it's safe enough, suddenly unlocking that room is still a shitty thing to do, even if they people shouldn't have been leaving their cash on the table to begin with.


You're confused about responsibility.  It is not irresponsible of businesses to accept zero conf transactions.  They knew there was inherent risk, and they judged that risk to be acceptable.  It was a calculated judgment, with full knowledge of the consequences.  It was **not** irresponsible.
Suddenly changing how easy it is to double spend, and thus changing that equation of risk, without giving sufficient notice and time to adapt -- *that's* irresponsible.

All the things you mentioned are not fixed, they are variable as well.  "Trustless" isn't Bitcoin.  You have "faith" (if you want to call it that) that enough miners are acting in a certain manner and control enough hashing power that the system will work as advertized.  It's *extremely* likely that that's true.  So the level of "trust" needed is significantly lower than any other system there is, but it's not trust*less*.  It's still about what *degree* of trust you want to accept -- how little trust is little enough for you to round down and call it trustless.  Same with "decentralized".  There's no magic number of nodes or hashing power that makes it decentralized or centralized.  It's all about what properties you desire and how many nodes is enough that you consider it decentralized.  And again with "permissionless".  We are all controlled by our thoughts, fears, expectations of others, physical abilities, etc. etc. etc.  Just how much freedom you have to do what you want "without permission" is as arbitrary as anything.
So once again, it comes down to exactly how you define those variables -- what values you have, and what you consider "good enough" to be when you're talking about them.

A transaction is a transaction.  If a miner mines it, it's valid.  Your own view of what should be acceptable plays no part.  You are only allowed to configure your own node.

It was misleading because there are certain obvious expectations that go along with hearing that somebody who owns/operates/maintains some product or service supports or doesn't support a view which directs impacts their product/service.  If a restaurant has a sign out front that says "eating meat is immoral", you expect it to probably be a vegetarian restaurant.  If a church has a sign out front that says "God hates fags", you don't expect the minister to be very progressive about homosexuality.  Likewise, when you read a quote from a Bitcoin software coder that says "I support segwit and do not support BU or BU's plan to hard fork", you naturally assume that their software isn't going to have the functionality to support it.  Only when you add the rest of the quote where the guy explicitly says that the software will be neutral can you know that that will be the case.
And it's frankly BS to say "oh but the title didn't have enough space for the full quote".  He could have given a shortened paraphrase of the full quote or titled it "Here's Thomas V's thoughts on scaling" and given the full quote inside the post.  Or any number of other things.  The title and post were specifically designed to be misleading.

We have the technology.  Just build in a namecoin like system like the onename people are doing, add an entry for a stealth address, and build in an OP_RETURN scanner into the client.  Bam, mostly anonymous payments to name entries instead of addresses.
I guess that seems too clunky of a solution for most people, but by god we \*could\* do it.

Yeah, each account has non-hardened children both for main and change addresses.

You implied that being accepted economic science is in itself enough to validate a claim as being true.


Yes, theories that have no current credibility in a community can eventually be accepted, either by that community or by others, by being testable, falsifiable, and logically valid.  It merely takes time.  I also suggested theories that aren't yet accepted *can* be credible.  Because credibility depends on the validity of the claim, whereas wider acceptance is merely recognition of that credibility, and as mentioned, such acceptance takes time.
I can make an incredible break through and have a very credible new discovery, yet many people may at first be skeptical and not accept it.  Only through repeated testing and scrutiny would my new discovery become widely accepted.
Additionally, wide acceptance can often happen *without* credibility, and many widely accepted things are later proved wrong.  Acceptance and credibility *often* go hand-in-hand because credibility usually leads to acceptance, but they are not mutually exclusive.  Non-credible theories may gain acceptance because people wish them to be true.  Credible theories may not gain acceptance because people wish they weren't true.
So yes, theories without acceptance may indeed still have immense credibility, and theories with no credibility may have wide acceptance.  There is no inconsistency about that, it's just how people are.
@_date: 2016-06-15 09:37:48
Be more mindful about using the terms science and logic.  They have specific meanings.  Economics is not a hard science, it is educated guesswork, often with little to no data.  And an argument can be logically consistent and still questionable or flat out wrong, because its truth depends on data which is not available.  Science does not gain credibility by being "accepted".  It gains credibility by being testable, falsifiable and repeatable, and continually failing to be disproved.

Indeed, a spade is a spade.  But there is no "network" aside from individual node operators setting their own choice.  When you frame my decision to change the parameters of MY software as an attack on *you*, you implicitly claim that I am taking some kind of action that infringes on you and your sovereignty and autonomy.  And that is just incorrect.  I can run any fucking software I damned well please.  You can frame it as me shutting down my Core node and starting up a new BTU node.  What you can't do is put any blame or fault or any of your problems on me.  You have no right to dictate what software I run, and it is not an attack to choose to run software.  There is no ethereal outside "network" that I harm by my actions.  The Bitcoin network is a VOLUNTARY collection of nodes and consensus emerges naturally when those nodes agree.  You do not get to tell me whether I program my node to be a Core node or a BU node or a fucking Litecoin node.
First you lot keep telling me "go ahead and fork, see if I care", and suddenly when you realize a large chunk of the network actually wants to do exactly that suddenly it's a fucking "attack".  No.  Fuck that.  You don't get to keep moving the fucking goal post.  And you don't get to play the victim and act like I'm infringing on you by reprogramming my own fucking software to be a part of the network I choose.
So yes, let's call a spade a spade.  Anybody who claims BU is an attack is a hypocrite who doesn't actually believe in individual rights, and a bully who whines to mommy when the other kids stop letting him beat them up.

He means cut off as in not being able to run a full node.  In his mind, Bitcoin is a success if 200,000 people mine and run nodes and fees are 20 btc per kb, and it's a settlement system for big banks, and there's only ever 1 or 2 transactions in a block.
Because in that scenario it's still "decentralized and censorship-resistant".

A bitcoin -- or rather a satoshi, or whatever unit you want to use -- is a digital commodity backed by the utility of the Bitcoin blockchain.  It represents the ability to publish data to the world's most secure digital ledger.  That data can be money, proof of authorship or timestamp, a name entry (think namecoin), a token representing other value (counterparty, colored coins, etc.) or any number of other things.  The censorship-resistance and security available with the Bitcoin blockchain is valuable, and a bitcoin token represents the ability to take advantage of the value of that ledger by making an entry in it.  So, as I noted earlier, a bitcoin unit is a commodity which is backed by the usefulness of the Bitcoin blockchain.  That is its inherent value.

Hmm there seem to be some kinks to work out.
@_date: 2016-06-16 20:25:07
Yes, mathematics and logic can only be "proven" to be true if you take a few base principles as axiomatically true.  However, if you accept those axioms, the whole of the fields can be logically derived from them.  That is what makes them so rock solid and unwaveringly true.
You will get no argument from me that a logically valid statement *must* be true.  And that when such a statement can indeed be made, empirical data isn't necessary to verify it.
The error most people have is when they believe a statement is logically valid when it is not.  With economics, this most often happens when assigning the base assumptions.  The theory is sound and logically consistent, but it makes assumptions about how people act which have no reasonable foundation.
For example, Praxeology makes plenty of assumptions about how and why people act the way they do, without the necessary justification that it is correct in that assessment.  The further theory may indeed be sound if you take that assumption as axiomatic, but on the other hand, the theory may crumble to shreds if it turns out it is not as good as predicting how people act.
Now, with ever increasing advances in neuroscience, we may one day soon have such valid and specific psychohistorical economic theories, theories that are logically coherent and have axioms of behavior derived from physics and biology... but we are not there yet!  Empirical study is still necessary to give confidence to, or cast doubt upon, sociological theories such as economics, because we simply lack the knowledge for any half way decent axioms of behavior.
And while logical proofs need no experimentation, if experiments did exist to empirically test the proof, and if they showed unexpected results, it would imply an error somewhere.  Either the test has some kind of standard deviation of possible results, or there was an error in the test, or the logical statement contains an as-of-yet-uncaught mistake.  Logic itself may not be fallible, but the humans who verify it certainly can be.  Surely if [this test]( gave different results, we would at least be double checking Pythagoras' math.  We would at the very least know an error exists somewhere, either in the theory or in the test.  The two cannot both be true and give different results.
Suffice to say, I remain unconvinced about the hardness of economic science.
@_date: 2016-06-13 04:47:53
Could you explain that more?  From reading the code, it looks like version 1 seeds are merely translated back into hex and the hex itself is used as the generator seed that is then hashed 100k times.  There is no validation other than that the list of version 1 words translate into hex of the right length.  What sort of validation can be done on version 1 seeds other than that?
And what types of version 1 seeds can be generated by version 1 that the version 2 client would reject?
My understanding is that Electrum 2 imports all version 1 seeds without problem, but if you generate a new wallet, it uses the version 2 method, with the BIP39 word list and the hash prefix validation.  But it sounds like you are saying some version 1 seeds are not valid.  Can you provide an example, so that I may better understand?

I think you're confused about how this works.  2+2=4, and if Euclid and Newton came back and said 2+2=5, they'd be wrong.  Their prior contributions don't make them right when they say 2+2 is 5.  The logic of mathematics is what matters.  Similarly, it doesn't matter what devs tell you, it matters what the code says.
I don't know how to be more clear about that.


That's why I told you I think the devs mislead you -- because it's *effectively* the same thing.... for nodes that run segwit software.
But for non-segwit nodes, the distinction matters very much.


In fact I do.  They need to be very carefully considered and tested.  This just happens to be one of the few rare cases where I think it's appropriate.


Well that's not true.  Now you're just making charged statements.... and it's even richer, because you don't actually know how Bitcoin works or what hard and soft forks are.  Maybe you should actually go and learn what you're talking about before going and getting yourself so riled up.


Another blatant falsehood.  That's just not true.  If that were the case, the presense of alt-coins would greatly diminish Bitcoin's value.  (Which is what Adam Back actually claimed a few years ago.)  And yet, Bitcoin is still trucking along.  That's because the hashing power and security behind it matter and contribute to its value.  And that would still be true, fork or no fork.


It's already well over 42 million, with all of the alt-coins added in, which is what a fork would be.  But the general view of what the One True Coin is, and its supermajority of hashing power, still would make it the de facto leader and its security and scarcity would remain intact.
You forget, all your fork arguments have already occured with alt-coins.


While public perception certainly is important, it shouldn't be the deciding factor, since like I said above, it doesn't matter who comes in and claims 2+2=5 and the sky is falling, math -- and software source code -- speaks for itself.


As is the ability to actually use Bitcoin, by having enough block space to add transactions to its blockchain ledger.


Yes, trust in a money is important, and yes a fork would temporarily damage some of the faith in Bitcoin.  But the alternative is letting Bitcoin stay where it is, unable to upgrade, and unable to help the world.  I'd far rather take a slight price hit and bad press for a few months if it means making Bitcoin stronger and better for the long haul.
You're also making arguments which have already been tested and invalidated by the bevvy of alt-coins that currently exist.  These same arguments were brought up when Namecoin and Litecoin (some of the first Bitcoin software forks) were made.  And yeah, they took some of Bitcoin's economic activity.  But that's ok, and Bitcoin survived, and the world kept turning.
And finally....


No, that's blatantly incorrect and stands out most glaringly of all.  Bitcoin is more like gold than the dollar.  The dollar relies on public faith and public faith alone.  But Bitcoin (the token) is a commodity, with intrinsic value and usefulness, regardless of the public view of it.  Gold has risen and fallen over the millennia, but it keeps on trucking along.  If Bitcoin ever did take a price hit, it would still keep on trucking and eventually recover (at least, up to its actual utility value).


Because the risks you worry about don't actually exist.  You have such a bleak view because you don't know how Bitcoin works, and you don't know the difference between fiat money and commodities.
You're making a whole lot of predictions and statements that are either flat out wrong, or that rely on an incorrect view of how things work.
I'm sorry to be so blunt and mean, but if you're going to fight so hard in this battle, it behooves you to actually know what's going on and what the potential outcomes actually are.
However, we are straying far far from the topic at hand, which is that segwit does not change the size of a block.  It doesn't matter who told you it does, it matters what the source code says and how Bitcoin actually works.

If you're going to bring the actual LAW law into it, like government law, then yes of course he broke the law.  He stole a bunch of money.  In virtually every civilized country, contract law goes on the basis of the *intent* of the contact, and additionally, you cannot legally sign away your rights.  That is, you can't sign a document saying I'm allowed to kill you and then I'm just allowed to go kill you.  It doesn't work like that.
Now you can make the argument that Ethereum doesn't have to follow any laws because it's decentralized and code is law, but if you're going to bring the real government law into it, then yes the attacker absolutely broke the law and stole money in the actual legal sense.  The DAO code is not a legally enforceable contract, and the *intent* of the contract was not for the attacker to do what he did.
The attacker absolutely did do something "illegal" in the strictest sense.  Because that's how the law works.

However, you'll find that most small blockers will NOT do that.  They believe that's too dangerous.  And some subset of them will not HF ever for any reason, because they think HFs fundamentally go against Bitcoin.

Because I want on chain scaling as well, and if segwit activates without it, after it was compomised and compromised and finally agreed to the smallest stupidest 2mb change... if segwit goes through without even that, then to me at least, it will prove Bitcoin is forever locked at 1mb and cannot scale.
Segwit and lightning are fine and will be very useful for a lot of things, but there are a lot of valid uses for on-chain transactions, and in order to accommodate adoption and growth, the blocksize needs to increase.  Further, despite what some devs think, I personally have run the numbers and do not think most of the proposed increases will significantly impact or further harm decentralization.
Therefore, I cannot in good conscience vote for segwit with my node or mining power -- it will simply be the final nail in the coffin for any future possibility of a hard fork.  I will switch to segwit after activation during the grace period though.... that is, if I don't decide to call it quits and move on to other things.
Segwit without a blocksize increase HF, as much scaling as it does provide, is not enough.  If it goes through without a HF, Bitcoin will be permanently capped in its capacity, which means fees beyond what an average user is willing or able to spend, which means that it is effectively censored to such users, as they have no ability to use it.  That goes against the entire purpose of Bitcoin and what it was meant to be.  I don't want Bitcoin to become a settlement network for the wealthy.  That's not the Bitcoin I signed up for.

Did Electrum v1 not validate seeds on restore?  Or are you referring to something else?
@_date: 2017-01-10 17:03:58
You can't.  There is some bank or broker or something that "backs" the crypto-token and says "I'll give you 1 gold for 1 crypto-token".  As long as people generally have faith that the backer will uphold that promise, the crypto-token will be traded at near the value of the physical asset.  If confidence in the backer goes away, the crypto-token will be traded cheaper.
There is no way to officially "back" something.  "Backing" is just somebody promising they will buy and sell it for a certain price.  So the value of being backed is totally dependent on how much confidence people have in the backer.
If Chase Bank "backs" a crypto-token for a dollar, it will probably trade at a price of around a dollar, because people will believe Chase won't go bust or reneg on their promise.  If Joe your neighbor backs something, it might not trade at face value on the open market.

Only one's own logical faculties.  This is yet another reason why bad theories can gain acceptance, because many people who aren't capable of making such determinations believe they are.  It's a systemic problem.  Nobody who knows little of quantum mechanics mistakenly believes they are experts at it, yet everybody who is poor with logic genuinely believes they are experts at it.


Once again, one's self.  There is no objective measure.  If one is not capable of judging a thing, he may turn to experts who are, because that is the best he can do, but if one is capable, the merits of a thing are apparent, since logic is true in the mathematical sense, and data is available for all to examine.  Reasonable minds may differ about various aspects or conclusions being unwarranted, but more testing and more data can settle such differences.


As an abstract or cultural phenomenon, I have no researched or given much thought to it, no, but as I believe your question is more about whether I understand the English language, and more specifically, what you are saying, the answer is yes.

Yeah, even though Litecoin uses Scrypt and has different block times, the transaction format and the public/private key cryptography is the same as Bitcoin, so the wallet.dat file format is exactly the same.

Ugh, that's the worst insult I've ever received.  I guess it makes sense coming from you, since you can't decern reality from fantasy, but still, being likened to Trump... ugh.  \*Shudders\*.
I have not denied anything I said.  You just quoted me defining what a block is.  But notice how nothing about that definition has mentioned how that data is serialized.
As \*I just told you\*, serialization is *how you format data*... it does NOT specify *what that data is*.  Formatting data a certain way is a different topic than *how* you format said data.  Do you understand that distinction?
I can serialize the letter a as "a" or as 97 or as 01100001, but it still stands for the same piece of data.  And no matter how you format/serialize it, it is a different set of data than the letter b.
Do you get it?
@_date: 2017-01-19 03:01:32
Segwit is not a blocksize increase.  Segwit allows more transactions to fit in a block by removing the ScriptSig data from a transaction, and all non-segwit nodes now can't validate transactions.  The blocksize is still capped at 1mb with segwit.

Electrum does NOT use hardened keys.  However, Electrum also doesn't show you the HD version of any of your keys.  So as long as you don't give anybody your master xpub key, there's no way you can accidentally divulge too much information.  Because you never have access to any other HD info besides your master key.  Don't give out your Bitcoin private keys, and don't give out your master xpub key.  (And obviously, don't give out your seed or any other secret/private info relating to your wallet.)  If you follow those rules, you will always protect your privacy and your addresses can't be linked together.
Important:  seriously, don't give out your master xpub key.  Treat that like a private key.  If somebody has that, they can derive all your addresses.  (Not the private keys -- so your money is safe -- but still, they can get all your addresses.)
Additionally, let's say they have the master xpub key and you also give them the private key for one of your addresses -- not the HD key, just the normal Bitcoin private key for one of your Electrum addresses.  Well because they have the xpub master key, they can derive the HD information for the private key you gave them, and now with both the private key and the HD info, they can work backwards to derive the master private key and then derive the private keys for all of your other addresses.  All because you gave them the master public key (and also of course, a private key).  So treat your master public key just like you would a private key -- something secret that is not to be shared with anybody.
Back to your original question.  Almost all wallets do NOT use hardened keys.  I don't know why, but they don't.  So be careful and keep that in mind.

I can't speak for the other 40%, but my node is not lazy.  My node will not signal support for segwit and will only start running segwit-compatable software if and when activation for it occurs.  My node disagrees with segwit for a number of reasons.  It is not lazy.

Yes, my own, and what the entire world has used until very recently, when some fraction of users decided to start using a different term.  You can also call "red" "green" if you want and say that I am using my definition and you are using yours, but that doesn't mean that words are arbitrary and not meant to convey meaning.  There is still a right and wrong way to use them, because they are meant to represent specific discrete thoughts and ideas, and when you go around using words differently than everybody else uses them, you lose the ability to communicate.
@_date: 2017-01-27 14:45:04
I completely agree.  As long as there exists some mechanism for people to interact in the way Bitcoin currently lets them interact, and which is as or more secure, I don't care what it's called or how it works.
I feel like many people don't realize that decentralization isn't the end goal here.  Decentralization is a *means* to an end.  The purpose of decentralization is to ensure that a ledger is trustworthy and censorship-proof in an environment where everybody is untrusted and state-level actors are attacking it.  Decentralization helps protect Bitcoin's ledger in that environment.... but if those security measures are possible in other ways, that's fine too.
@_date: 2017-01-27 13:29:00
Yup.  I agree completely.  It's disheartening.
@_date: 2017-01-22 08:28:44
No, mostly just exasperated.  Every comment and post you make is terrible.  And then when you are shown to be wrong, you resort to comments like the one you just made.
@_date: 2017-01-19 04:17:35
Yes, there is new code, and yes, the new code allows 4mb of block+witness.  However the MAX_BLOCK_SIZE is still enforced.  That's what makes it a "soft" fork and not a hard fork.  The actual block itself -- the thing on which the proof of work hash is computed -- cannot be over 1mb.
The things you are talking about are not blocks.  You are talking about the extraneous "witness data".  The new Core segwit client, sometimes mixes witness data and block data together, for the purposes of calculating things like "block weight", but block data and witness data are absolutely two distinct objects.
And the blocksize remains capped at 1mb.  Yes, segwit-enabled nodes can process more than 1mb worth of data for each block, but that data is not in the block itself.  In fact, that's where segwit gets its name -- Segretated Witness.  "Segregated" meaning separate and not included inside the block.  "Witness" meaning the thing that "bears witness" to the validity of the transaction, aka the signature data.  So the term "segwit" quite literally means "signature data that isn't in the block".
With that information, I hope now you can see how my original comment was completely accurate.  Segwit indeed removes signature data from the block, and the block size is indeed still capped at 1mb.  The "block weight" and other metrics you cite refer to the combination of block data and segwit data, which are two distinct sets of data.  The blockchain does not know or care about segwit data, and blocks verify perfectly fine without them.  All the blockchain sees is a valid proof of work hash and a bunch of anyone-can-spend transactions, which are all perfectly valid.

@_date: 2017-01-22 00:55:50
It is not gone.  It must still be checked to ensure that non-segwit blocks remain below 1mb, in order to ensure that it remains a soft fork rather than a hard fork.  If it was gone and a block happened to fall within the right block weight, but when stripped was just over 1mb, that would cause a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-01-27 13:39:49
That's the gist of the argument, the problem is that "secure" is never defined adequately.  Most people think Bitcoin is secure *enough* right now, but some people think it's at risk.  And everybody has different ideas about how secure it needs to be and what threat models we should be using.
I happen to think that Bitcoin needs to be secure enough to be censorship-proof and resist against state-level maliciousness.  And I think making it *more* secure than that, at the expense of the users, is harmful, since users don't give a shit how secure it is if they can't use it.  Whereas I think a good chunk of people in the community, especially in the dev community, think Bitcoin would be better if it was perfectly secure but so expensive to use that only two people on earth could afford it.  But it would be secure!
To my mind, the whole purpose of security is to protect users -- to ensure that people who need Bitcoin are able to trust it and to use it.  If you price them out of it, it doesn't matter that it's secure, because the effect on them is the same -- they are censored from using it.  Bitcoin only needs to be secure *enough* to protect against all possible threats.  Any more secure than that is a mis-use of resources.
@_date: 2017-01-27 14:06:08
Probably, but not guaranteed.  There are different methods of creating keys from the seed words, even when using the same list of words.  There is a "standard" that is commonly used, which doesn't have a name, but is referred to as "BIP 39 and BIP 44 compatible", and any wallet that says they use BIP 39 and 44 will all work the same way.  "BIP 39" is a method of converting words into a master key, and "BIP 44" is a method of deriving addresses from the master key.  So any wallet that uses the same method to derive a master key from the words and also the same method to derive addresses from the master key... if a wallet does both of those things the same way, then obviously it will be compatible with any other wallet that does things the same way.
Blockchain.info, like the majority of wallets, does use BIP39+44, so you will likely be able to get your money using another wallet.  The one notable exception is Electrum, who does not use BIP39+44 at all, and uses their own different method.
However, no matter what your wallet uses, the algorithm for deriving the private keys is public and known, so even if all the wallets disappear, you'll be able to get at your money one way or another.  For example, I myself have written a python script to get at my keys, so in the worst case scenario, i could import my keys individually, one by one, into any Bitcoin software that lets you import private keys.

That's simply not true.  He sold it because he wanted nothing more to do with the project, because he believed he saw the writing on the wall about its failing governance.  He had already made plenty of money from it, having been around since 2010, when a Bitcoin was less than a dollar.  His decision to exit from the project and sell his Bitcoins was unrelated to price.  Everything he said about Bitcoin was, and remains, true today, regardless of the price.

@_date: 2017-01-22 01:16:51
And I define "block" as the data over which the proof of work hash operates.  And that data is the block header.  For segwit blocks, the data on which the proof of work operates does not include signature data, only a hash of that data in the coinbase transaction, which can be arbitrary data as far as a non-segwit node is concerned.  So a non-segwit node can fully validate a block, with valid proof of work and valid anyone-can-spend transactions, but then it may or may not be valid as far as segwit nodes are concerned.  Non-segwit nodes define the block as the block data.  Segwit nodes define block as "non-segwit block plus witness data", except in their minds, they have the "real" block and non-segwit nodes have the "incomplete block".
So you're just redefining what a block is to mean "old block plus witness data".  And yeah, if you go around redefining words, anything can mean anything.  But that doesn't mean people who use the current definition of a block are wrong about what the definition of a block is.

You mean, only one not using the *default settings*?  Changing defaults is now malconfigured?  Transactions with NOPs in them are non-standard, that's it.  That's all.  It's trivially easy to set ones node to relay and mine them.  In fact I do it on my node, so that I can relay and mine low-fee transactions.
But yes, keep trying to change the argument.  Before I was wrong and it was impossible... now that I explained exactly how it's possible, you say it's only mis-configured nodes who can do it.
I wonder what you'll say next to try to reframe things so you are right.

I mean, like I've already said, the witness data is not part of a block.  You can keep saying it is, but it's not.  The merkle root of the witness data is in the coinbase transaction, but non-segwit nodes have no way of validating it.

Uhhh. you said it was *impossible* for non-segwit nodes to mine segwit transactions.  Now you're just incorrectly stating wrong historical fact.  But that's SOP for you I guess.


Actually helping them *unstick* them by shipping out their non-standard RBF transactions.  So the guy who used Electrum with a low fee and a max sequence isn't totally boned for the next week.


No, I'm a real *Bitcoiner*.  You know, Bitcoin, the peer to peer cash system.


Because that's the proportion they take in the mempool -- that's an accurate representation of Bitcoin's real usage.


You're confused about BU and Classic.  I haven't looked at Classic's code so I can't speak about it, but BU is fully validating Bitcoin node.  That may change in the future if it and Core diverge, but as that has not happened, they are completely cross-compatible at the moment.
I also like how you blame *me* for "fucking over SPV nodes" when segwit makes every non-segwit node an SPV node.  Basically, you created the problem and then blamed me for not fixing it.  Dat logic...


You're confused.  BU is available right now.  (And just to preempt your retarded response... no, increasing the block size isn't a "bug" just because you disapprove of it.)


Banned?  Who?  From what?  What are you talking about?  I choose who my node connects to and what transactions I mine and relay, but that's not banning anybody.  That's my choice of configuration.  You lot are the ones claiming there is some objective definition of spam.


It is configured currently to do so.  I've been mining for about 5 years now.  My node has relayed and mined non-standard transactions for the past 3 and a half years.
And yes, I absolutely corrected you.  The fact that you don't understand it doesn't mean I failed to do it.  2+2=4 whether or not you see it or understand it.


No, I merely explained how you were wrong.  That's not "semantics".  That's "facts".


I was not claiming anything about the possible ramifications of nodes mining invalid blocks, I was claiming it was a possibility introduced by segwit.  That is a statement of fact and it is a correct statement.


Your inability to see or accept facts doesn't make them any less true.


The network *cannot* kick off "malicious" miners.  Because the "network" is individual nodes making their own choices, and a valid block is a valid block, regardless of your personal definition of "malicious".


You keep using that word.  I don't think it means what you think it means.

Really!?  Easy you say!?  To get a non-segwit node to mine and relay anyone-can-spend transactions?  Because just a few posts ago, you claimed it was **impossible**.
Well I'm glad I've convinced you of your error!!


Fortunately, you don't get to decide what I do and don't do on my node.  Yes, some people abuse it and I have to issue temporary bans occasionally.  Yes, some nodes don't connect to me.  That is their right and their choice.  I run Bitcoin in order to help people.  That means, relaying and mining transactions that people find "stuck", and some things Luke-jr would consider spam, and dust.  I don't fill my blocks with them, but I allocate 100kb-200kb to them, and I relay 100% of transactions I get.  Because I understand that the purpose of Bitcoin is to help people.  Just as I run a Tor relay, I know it will be abused by many, but I also know that it's vital that it exist for those who need it.  Bitcoin is not supposed to be a settlement network for the wealthy.  It was explicitly designed to be peer to peer **cash**.  You lot have forgotten that.  Well I fucking haven't and I will always run a fully validating and relaying node with exceedingly permissive rules.  Because I can afford to and because I want to help subsidize those who can't afford to but still need Bitcoin for their survival.  Because I fucking remember what Bitcoin was created for.


There is no such thing as spam you dolt.  You are free to drop and not relay and not mine whatever transactions you disapprove of.  But the fact that you personally don't like them, or that they aren't profitable to you -- that doesn't make them spam.  A valid transaction is a valid transaction.  You are free to do what you want with your node, but my node will mine and relay valid transactions.


I only hold transactions for 6 weeks.  Perhaps you should change your settings if you have 2 year old transactions.


You're confused about the context here.  You said the only way a non-segwit node would process stripped segwit transactions was accidentally.  I corrected you.  Then YOU claimed that changing one's node configuration to do so was malicious.  You were the one who claimed both "accidental" AND "malicious".  All I did was correct you when you said a non-segwit node couldn't be configured to relay stripped segwit transactions.
Do you see what has happened here?  You have taken your own wrong words, attributed them to me, and then attacked your own shitty argument.
I'm not even mad, that's impressive.


I mean, that's just blatantly false.  You can go read our conversation yourself.  You clearly started out saying it was impossible for non-segwit nodes to relay and mine stripped segwit transactions.  "Impossible" was the word you used.


Just... wow.  I hesitate to ask how you can even think that, and I know from your other reply that you'll just piss off into the corner and claim you were trolling once you realize you're wrong, so at least I have that to look forward to...

Ok then, let me elaborate:
1.  Gavin provided the data for his 20**MB** blocksize testing and outlined what hardware requirements were necessary for it, and provided very reasonable arguments about why that minimum hardware requirement was reasonable.
2.  Any coin can fork with any amount of support.  And a coin with 70% support clearly has the majority of community behind it.  He again laid out a good argument for why he felt that 95%+ unanimous consensus was not good to wait for.  Further, a fork at 70%+ is very likely to succeed.  So, every point he made was correct, you just personally disagree with doing it.  That doesn't make his points invalid though, it just means you have a philosophical disagreement with him about how the community should move forward.
3.  He stated many times that he had personal communications with Craig and the writing style was like Satoshi's.  And he also stated -- and people seem to forget this -- *that he met Craig in person and Craig signed a message of Gavin's choosing, which Gavin verified.*  It's completely fucking reasonable for him to conclude Craig was Satoshi given those two things having happened.  It's **also** reasonable for you and I to not believe him when we haven't witnessed either of those things, and when we haven't seen a signature we can verify.  Might Gavin have been conned?  Sure.  But it's not totally crazy for him to have come to the conclusion he came to.  It's actually a very reasonable conclusion, given what he personally witnessed.
So, like I said:  ***Oh look, the same old nonsense that's been explained and debunked a million times already.***
There is literally zero reason to be attacking Gavin.  He has not acted unreasonably or maliciously in any way.  The community just got caught up in hype and made him the poster boy for all their fears and hates.  It's totally unwarranted, and you should all be ashamed.  If you disagree with him about the blocksize and Craig, that's perfectly fine.  But attacking Gavin for his views, which were all well-explained and perfectly reasonable, is lunacy.  You should be ashamed.

And if you have a brain you should also see that raising the blocksize is the only way to enable the capacity for other people to be able to use Bitcoin and have it empower them.
Decentralization is not a means unto itself.  The purpose of decentralization is to make sure the ledger is censorship-proof and trustworthy.  It needs to be *possible* for you to run a node and verify it yourself, but it doesn't need to be *cheap and easy*.  Especially if being cheap and easy makes it so the majority of the world simply can't use Bitcoin because there's not enough room for transactions or the fees are too high.  If decentrlaization and the ability to run a node start hurting the ability of people to be able to use Bitcoin, then that needs to be addressed.  Remember, decentralization is just a means to an end-- the end being that the ledger is censorship-proof and trustworthy.  If nobody can use the ledger because they can't afford it or there's no room, they are *effectively* censored.  They don't give a shit *why* they don't have access to the protections of Bitcoin -- whether it's lack of scaling, or whether it's the state preventing them from using it -- all that matters is they are unable to use it.  *It's the same outcome.*
Bitcoin was not built to be a censorship-proof store of value for the wealthy.  It was built to be censorship-proof peer-to-peer cash.  I don't know why people seem to forget that.

No problem.  A redeem script is (usually) just a collection of public keys, and this its security is (roughly) the same as a public key.  If the elliptic curve math is broken, and public keys can be reversed into private keys, then any public key or redeem script that is known is vulnerable.  But any money sitting in a normal or multisig address (which is a hash) are still safe.
I hope that makes it all clear.  Let me know if you have any more questions.
@_date: 2017-01-23 00:07:04
No, the post is correct.  Non-segwit nodes do not and cannot know or understand the witness hash in the coinbase transaction, and as far as they are concerned, that could be mutated and they'd still have perfectly valid block data to compute a proof of work on.

Based on what you can trade it for.  What amount of goods or services it can buy.  That's all money is -- a representation of some amount of goods/services that is consistent, so we can conceptualize it more easily.  You might say a Bitcoin is worth 2000 apples or 1500 oranges, but then if apples become rare it might only be worth 500 apples but still worth 1500 oranges.  What you're looking for is just some constant to use to represent abstract value.  That's what money is used for.  A $100 bill is just a shitty piece of cloth.  You value it higher than that because you expect to be able to buy some certain amount of food or other things with it.  That's the same for any currency.  Bitcoin also has inbuilt inherent value, unlike the cloth paper money, but the idea is still the same.  A bitcoin is worth whatever you are willing to trade it for.  If somebody will give you 2000 apples for it and you're willing to make that trade, then that's what it's worth.
Money is no different from trading baseball cards.  A bunch of people are willing to trade certain amounts for certain amounts of other things, and if you put enough of them together a "market" forms and an average "price" develops.

You are welcome to pull out your e-peen as much as you want.  How long you've been around doesn't really matter, since you admitted in our other discussion that you had no idea how Bitcoin worked and you were relying on what others told you in order to form your opinion.  Length of time in the Bitcoin space doesn't actually factor into whether or not you know what you're talking about.  But that's cute of you to pretend like you have a clue by telling me my technical knowledge isn't far off.  Yes, I know it's not far off, because I actually understand it.  (I'm moderately concerned about your claim of submitting white papers after you admitted you don't know how any of this works.  That's... "confusing and inconsistent" would be the nicest way of putting it.)
And I too have been around since the early days.  Early 2011 to be precise.  And like you, I have been mining since then.  So by all means, pull out your e-peen and show me what you got.  Don't hold back.  By all means, let go of all this "not being rude" you've been holding back and be rude.  Put me in my place with your knowledge and how long you've been in the Bitcoin sphere.

The reason I'm harping on about the distinction, is because I want to make sure people understand the difference between a hard fork and soft fork capacity increase. It is my opinion that if segwit activates without any hard fork, that that will be the final nail in the coffin for the possibility of any future hard fork under any circumstance. So even though segwit is a much needed capacity increase, I cannot endorse it, because I think long term Bitcoin will be worse off. I know you may disagree, but I wanted to explain why I'm making such a big deal out of what to you may seem like a semantic, stupid distinction. It is important to me that "non-segwit block size" and "segwit block size" be understood as distinct.
@_date: 2017-08-18 07:57:27
Yes. I also understand how modest increases at a lesser pace than technological growth don't increase centralization.
@_date: 2017-01-27 13:27:30
Ok, so this is going to be a looong explanation.
Bitcoin public keys are long hex numbers, usually beginning with 02 or 03.  They are called "keys" because the way you "own" a Bitcoin is by having a private key which corresponds to a public key.  So you have one string of text called a private key, which is mathematically linked to another text called your public key.  (They're actually numbers, but you see them as text whenever you view them, so I'll just call them a string of text.)  And with the private key, you can "sign" messages, and because of how cryptography works, if somebody has the signature, they can determine that you must have used your private key to create that signature.  It's a mathematical proof that you own the private key without having to give out your private key.
So when somebody wants to send you Bitcoins, they send them to your public key, and then you use your private key to sign a statement saying "send these coins to somebody else".  And because the whole world can verify the signature and see that you must have used the right private key to make that signature, they know it's a valid transaction.
(In reality, you send coins to an *address* which is actually a *hash* of the public key, not the public key itself.  A hash is a one-way function which sort of hides the public key.  But that's not relevant for our discussion.)
So back when Bitcoin was fairly new, people just generated new random keys and just stored them all together in a wallet file.  That's all a wallet is -- a collection of random keys.  That became problematic, because people would sometimes lose their wallet files or have an old backup that didn't include newly generated keys, and so people were always losing money.
So somebody came up with the idea for HD wallets.  These were "keys" that were longer strings of text, so they could hold both the Bitcoin key as well additional information to link them to other keys.  So you could use them to generate new keys that LOOKED like random new keys, but were actually secretly linked to this HD key.  That way, you could just backup your HD master key, and then you could use that to re-generate all of your keys if you lost your wallet file.  This is obviously much better than the original method of having only new random keys, because with this new method, you only have to backup your HD key.
Where I think you got confused is that HD keys generate *new HD keys*.  It's not just your master key that is a HD key.  Technically, all of your addresses are also HD keys.  Your wallet software just doesn't show you that-- it only shows you the addresses and private keys, not the HD key information.  And all of those "child" HD keys are derived from the master key.  But those child keys themselves could be used as a master key for some new set of keys.
So an "xpub" key is an HD key that is a public key.  It has a private key associated with it, which begins with "xprv".  The long string of text after the "xpub" or "xprv" part contains both the Bitcoin key and the HD information used to derive new keys.  So you can convert an xpub key into a Bitcoin public key, or an xprv key into a Bitcoin private key.  It's just when you do that, you strip away all that other information about how it links to other keys.  That's why there's no number of addresses that will allow somebody to tell your xpub master key... because they'd also need that extra HD link information.  Which Electrum never even shows you.  It only shows you that for the main master key, so that you have the necessary info to derive your other keys in an emergency.  But every address in your wallet does actually have an xpub version of it -- it's just that you never see it.
So when people talk about "parent" and "child" keys, they just mean one key that generates another key and the two are linked together.  So if you ever show somebody a child xpub version of your key, they now have that linking data and could figure out the parent key.  But only the public key version, not the private key.  So your money would still be safe, just not your anonymity.)
A hardened HD key is a special type of key that can derive new keys, but where even with knowing the xpub of those new keys, an attacker can't work backwards and derive the "parent" key.  So those maintain your privacy.  You can show the link between the two only with the parent key -- the derived child key cannot by itself link to the parent key.
That's useful so that if say you have 3 different wallets all derived from the same master key and you derive new hardened keys to be the pseudo-master keys for each of the individual wallets, and then each of those new pseudo-master keys derive new non-hardened keys for the addresses in those wallets.  Now, let's say one wallet gets its private key leaked, and the attacker uses its HD link info to derive the wallet master key.  Well because that wallet pseudo-master key is hardened, the attacker can't go further than that -- he isn't able to derive the top-most real master key, which would allow him to re-generate the other two wallet keys.  Being "hardened" strips away the ability for a "child" key to link to its parent key.
I don't know why all wallets don't just use hardened keys for everything, but for some reason they don't.  The only reason not to use hardened keys is if you want to prove two keys are linked together, and I don't know why anybody would want to do that.
Please feel free to keep asking questions.  This is a lot of stuff, and I may have done a bad job explaining things, so I want to make sure you understand everything you need.

Bitcoin is in beta.  It's your own fault if you invest more than you're willing to lose.
@_date: 2017-01-19 11:17:11
It's hard to say.  Generally you need only the seed words, however it is possible to combine a password that is required in addition to the seed words.  So some wallets use only the seed words to rebuild the keys and then use the password to encrypt the derived keys -- this would mean you would only need the seed words to rebuild the keys yourself.  But then some other wallets use the password during the key rebuilding process and you'd thus need both the password and the words to rebuild the keys yourself.
Since you also have a PIN, my best guess is that your hardware device uses the password during the rebuild process and so you need the seed and also the password.  And then it uses the pin as a password to encrypt the derived keys.  But that's just my guess.  I can't say for sure.
@_date: 2016-06-18 19:31:54
A safe deposit box is an excellent idea.  There's no real perfect answer.  It depends on your threat model.  You could also encrypt the seed with a simple easy to remember password, and have THAT as your paper backup at home.  Then if it gets stolen, you have a little bit of a safety net which gains you extra time to move your funds before the password is cracked.
I have mine encrypted on cloud storage, because I'm reasonably sure about the security of my computers (and about the strength of the encryption password), and I also don't have a lot of coins to begin with.  But my methods might not be appropriate for you.

It only increases the block size if you redefine what a "block" is.  The block size is still at 1mb.  That's why segwit can be a soft fork.

@_date: 2017-01-19 02:50:14
No.  Literally nobody is talking about increasing the supply of coins.  All Bu does is make the blocksize a user defined setting and let users decide how they handle blocks of various sizes.  That is, you can say "I'll consider 3mb blocks valid, but not larger than that, unless a few blocks have been mined on top of that larger block in which case I'll begrudgingly move over to that chain."  Or, you can set it to "I consider up to 1mb blocks valid, and will never ever under any circumstances accept any larger blocks." if you want to run BU but support small blocks.  Or you can set it to "Send me your largest blocks, I don't care about the size of a block, I only validate proof of work and the longest proof of work chain is what I consider valid."
All BU does is let each node decide how it handles blocksize.  That's it.  Nothing else.  Nothing to do with the supply of coins.
The worry and dispute about it is that larger blocks may take longer to get relayed and verified and thus fragment the network as well as make it take longer to verify blocks and more costly to run a node.  Some people thing those dangers are so great that larger blocks must not be allowed under any circumstances.  I can't speak for others, but having run the numbers and simulations myself, I think it'll work out fine and I support BU.

Ease of use.  They keep one key and an encrypted copy of a second key, which you decrypt in your browser with your vault password.  So it's secure (barring malicious JS), and the user experience is extremely easy.  It's basically for lay users who don't know how to make their own multisig, but want the increased security and the knowledge that Coinbase can't steal it.  So it's better than a bank, but as you say, not nearly as good as doing things yourself.  But if you're not capable of doing things yourself, it's a good compromise.

If a hardfork of segwit + **2** mb  was on the table, you would get the big block camp onboard instantly.  13 is not necessary, and is probably too high for right now.  3 or 4 would be ideal, but 2 at least shows that compromise and moving forward are at least possible.
But that will never happen.  You have been mislead into thinking that some kind of compromise is possible.  Core ardently believes they are right and are protecting Bitcoin from the grave dangers of centralization they believe are posed by increasing the block size and they will not budge.  They will never give an inch.  I mean, on the one hand, I'm glad they're sticking to their guns when they believe they are protecting Bitcoin.  On the other hand, I think they're mistaken about the dangers of an increase and I am extremely frustrated by their immobility, and of course, their belief they are protecting Bitcoin means that a block size increase is not actually on the table, no matter what you may have heard.

That would be true if segwit provided 2.1mb blocks.  However, as I have already outlined, it does not.  The blocksize remains at 1mb with segwit.
I'm not sure you understand how bitcoin works or what a "soft" fork means.  Any block size larger than 1mb would necessarily be a hard fork.  Segwit is a soft fork.

I'm sorry, but if you fail to see how exchanging something for goods or services is relevant to being a currency, we're never going to get anywhere.


No, it comes from being able to trust the ledger.  We only audit participants by using the ledger as proof.


I agree.  When and how and to what number were never settled on.  What *was* settled on was that it should be done and that block space was not intended to be a scarcity property of the system.  The video you posted may have been around in 2013, but at that time the community at large was still very much in favor of raising the block size at some point in the future.  The shift to many people being opposed to doing so didn't happen until 2015.

Only for a time.  Gold has been used for thousands of years as money.  It may have been worthless to some people at some points in time, but in the end, it still has intrinsic value and scarcity, so people inevitably start using it as money again.


Yes, we do disagree about how the public would react.


We, and everybody else, are in agreement about that.  You seem to think that a hard fork blocksize increase means that the 21 million coin limit is up for grabs.  That's not true and I don't know why you think that.




No, it would not be the end of cryptocurrencies altogether.Sure, the ecosystem would be shaken up, but cryptocurrencies wouldn't just die.  But again, the 21 million limit is not up for being changed, I don't know why you're harping on that so much.

Wait a little bit and see if it gets more.  If it slowly goes up, then you're good.  Although, bitnodes giving you the green should mean you're good.
Everybody saying above 8 means you're good are not quite correct.  It is true that one port can only handle 8 connections, but sometimes even with the port closed, you'll get 8 outgoing connections and 2 or 3 more IPv6 outgoing connections and you'll see 10 or 11 connections and think your port is open but it's actually not and the count above 8 is just IPv6 connections.
But, that's irrelevant, since bitnodes gave you the green light.  You should be good.

As for the DNMs, LOL no they don't give a shit about Bitcoin.  Or even decentralization.  Why do you think they haven't flocked to OpenBazaar yet?

You are using a very old wallet.  You must upgrade to a new wallet.
That error is occuring because the signature in your transaction is malformed in a way that used to be accepted by the network but is not accepted any longer.
If you are willing to publicly post the transaction hex, I can reformat it for you and broadcast it to the network.  If not, you need to import your private keys to a newer wallet and then try again.
If you want to google the problem, you have a "high S value" in your signature.  Basically, Bitcoin signatures can actually be valid with one of two numbers.  To prevent malleability, Bitcoin now only uses one of those two numbers.  Your software generated a signature with the second of the two.  The two numbers are linked, so it's easy to convert the signature from one number to the other, and the transaction will still be valid, but you have to know how to do it.

You can view the transaction in question [here](  The address 
is simply Bitcoin software trying to interpret the wallet address hash160 
`8bf88788f44306d9e92857c47ce6290cbc971d76` 
which also corresponds to the litecoin address 
That's a litecoin wallet.dat file.  The transaction is showing up as unconfirmed in your Bitcoin software because obviously none of the reference inputs are in the Bitcoin blockchain.

NOP has a pretty clear definition for how to deal with it in the scriptsig.  That definition has always been referred to as "anyone can spend".  If you're redefining words again, then so be it.  But there has always been a thing called "anyone can spend" and claiming otherwise is rewriting history.  No-op's have a very clear way in which they are processed.
@_date: 2017-01-16 14:05:47
Signalling is used as an indicator, but every node knows it can lie.  You are free to use it as a measure of what the network \*claims\* it will work with, but you still get the actual blocks to see for sure, and you are of course free to ignore signaling completely and just use block history and/or whatever algorithm you want to decide what to set your blocksize too.  Consensus will emerge from what people *actually* set their blocksize to, not what is signaled.  That should be obvious, but apparently not.

LOL yeah nice try.  Sure, *that's* the reason you won't go into the technicals, because *I* am so biased that it's not worth it.  Not because you don't understand any of it, oh no.

You're confused about what the phrase "means the same thing it always has" means.
@_date: 2017-01-23 00:03:31
No True Scotsman claims about how words are used doesn't change how the definition of the word block has always been used.  The fact remains, words have objectively correct meanings based on their common usage.  "Block" has always means something specific.  You are free to use it differently, but don't go pretending that it's always been used your way or that anybody who really understood blocks would do it your way.  You're just redefining words at your whim.

Look at you, trying to twist words around!  I'd say A for effort, but it's a shitty effort in addition to being a flat out lie.
All I've claimed is I know how Bitcoin works and haven't learned anything new about it in this thread.  I never claimed I was always right about everything, and the times I've been "corrected" and not replied "you're right" were times that the people "correcting" me were incorrect.


Of course they can.  They can include invalid segwit transactions that appear to non-segwit nodes as valid anyone-can-spend transactions.

You and literally all of the Core community are saying that Bitcoin was never meant to be a peer to peer currency.


That would be true if there wasn't an artificial cap on the block size.  I would be thrilled for the market to decide!


The problem is that you may value $3 differently than somebody who makes $3 a day.
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:08:34
Those properties only matter if people can use Bitcoin.
For example, a decentralized and secure $1M Bitcoin with $1k tx fees does not actually offer any security to the vast majority of people, because the vast majority of people could not afford to transact with it.
Security is only a valuable property to **people**.  If people cannot use it, security doesn't matter.

Its' fine.  The worry is if they are ever compromised and take over the website.  Basically, the vault works like this: they have a key, you have a key, and then they have an encrypted key, which you temporarily unlock with a password whenever you interact with the vault.  (And you also have that key in unencrypted form, so you have two of the three keys, which will allow you to spend the money even if Coinbase disappears.)
So theoretically, you're safe, as long as it's a good password and you don't log into them *while* they're compromised... which to be fair you could easily do.  It's not like you go read the javascript source every time you visit their site.  I think a good compromise is for them to do what Blockchain.info and MEGA did and release browser extensions that verify the code.
But other than that possibility, it's likely plenty safe.  Still, hardware wallets like Trezor and KeepKey are of course the better option, but Coinbase's vault is probably going to be fine for you.  As long as you're aware of the potential risks, no matter how unlikely.

Ah well in that case, you can go fix your previous comment since it's incorrect.  Changing default config values does not make a node malformed or mean it's acting in some crazy manner.

Yeah, the UASF users were loud, but the actual node count (and miner count, not that the users cared about miners..) was extremely low and unlikely to succeed.  UASF had about 20% node support and 12% hashrate support.
I'm not saying the UASF didn't contribute to getting segwit locked in, but the NYA was a far bigger catalyst.  You just didn't hear about it because this sub censored itself into becoming an echo-chamber.  (Not that rbtc is any better.)

I appreciate that you really genuinely believe you're right.  It's just that there's historical data that contradicts your view.  Your fears simply are not grounded in reality.

When you use that as your sole technical argument, it heavily implies it.  The fact that you *only* quoted the devs telling you it was a blocksize increase without any further argument, even after I explained what was right and what was wrong about what they said, pretty heavily says that you don't have any other arguments to make.

You understand correctly, but even though it might not feel like it, the number of combinations of 12 words is so big that it's not possible for somebody to guess them.  The chance of somebody doing so, even with a computer churning through tries over and over, is so vanishingly small that it's just not something to worry about.

Non-segwit miners who know nothing of, and cannot validate, the witness hash in the coinbase tx, who may mutate it during their attempt to mine a valid hash.  They may produce a valid hash, on a valid block, which only segwit nodes will consider invalid.
@_date: 2017-01-16 14:09:55
Your understanding is not correct.  Bitcoin is not "stateless" in the way you define it.  Each node can still have different blockchains -- they often do in fact, when blocks are mined by two different nodes at roughly the same time, and then some of the network has one block as the top, and some have the other block.  Eventually they converge when another block is mined on top of one of them.
BU just makes this process take a little longer, because occasionally some nodes won't consider a block until some number of blocks have been mined on top of it.  So there will be more fragmentation at the tip of the blockchain.  But it will still always converge onto one main chain eventually, just as Bitcoin does now.  Just instead of being reasonably confident with 1 or 2 confirmations like you are now, you can be reasonably confident at 5 or 6.  1 or 2 would be more prone to being orphaned/re-org'd than they are currently.  But convergence still happens.
@_date: 2017-01-14 17:52:22


I can't speak for all of the types of vaults they may or may not have --  I've only used their multisig vault, with the option of me the user being in charge of the keys.  And with that setup at least, they could go out of business and you wouldn't lose your coins.  The money is in a 2-of-3 multisig where they have one key, you have one key, and both of you have one key that is encrypted with your vault password.  This way, they cannot spend the money without you, because their second key is encrypted.  But you could spend the money without them, because you could decrypt the encrypted key if you really wanted to figure out how.  So you really would have all of the information necessary to recover the vault money in an emergency.  (I even wrote a Python script to do that, in order to learn how their vault setup works.  So I can absolutely recover my vault keys if I need to.  And I'm sure other people have done the same somewhere out there.  Coinbase also has an open source standalone offline javascript webpage app you can download and keep that will give you your vault keys too.)

Probably not in its current form, no.  But in some form, it can, and it must.  Remember, having everybody store a copy of the blockchain is done in order to preserve decentralization.  Decentralization is done in order to protect the ledger in an adversarial environment with powerful adversaries.  Decentralization is **not** the end goal.  Ensuring the ledger is accurate and can be trusted, even in an adversarial environment with state-level adversaries -- *that* is the end goal.  So if we find a way to do sharding or some other mechanism that reduces the burden on nodes -- even if it also reduces decentralization -- as long as we can ensure the ledger can be trusted and accessed, that's all that's required.  Decentralization is simply the current best way to achieve that.  But that may not always be the case.
Additionally, I have more faith than you about technology being able to keep up and fix problems along with way.  The old argument of "the internet will never be able to do X" that keeps getting disproven.
So with the innovation of technology and possible changes in how we secure ledgers in adversarial environments, I'm reasonably confident that cryptocurrency will be able to handle the world's transactions in a completely censorship-free and open-and-cheap-for-all way.  Maybe it won't be Bitcoin, but it'll happen.
@_date: 2017-01-22 00:40:50
I mean, you can call it whatever you want.  The fact of the matter is that the proof of work algorithm does not cover the witness data.  Sure, it covers a hash of the witness data in the coinbase transaction, but non-segwit nodes don't know anything about that.
@_date: 2017-01-27 14:40:36
All xthin/compact blocks do is change how the data is relayed.  Once the relaying of information is complete, both nodes will still be working with the same information.  That's not remotely comparable to how segwit and non-segwit nodes operate.
If for example, I store the letter A in binary, and you store the letters ABC in hex.... then we are not only storing our info in different ways, we are also *storing different information*.
@_date: 2017-01-13 19:36:05
Wow.  Yeah, ditto.
@_date: 2016-11-22 23:15:54
My claim is that super large blocks do not propagate well and thus have a significantly increased orphan rate, negating the profit for those blocks and in turn causing miners to not mine them.  If 10% of miners are well connected and mine super big blocks, the other 90% can just ignore and orphan them.  If some large majority is well connected and mines big blocks... then great, miners can clearly handle large blocks, and less powerful and less well connected full nodes that don't need to have up-to-the-second info for mining can take an extra 20 or 30 seconds to download and process the bigger blocks.
What is the specific attack you are worried about and the specific consequences of that attack?  We already see such attacks with transactions -- a large amount of tx's flood the network, full nodes change their rules to drop and don't relay them, miners pick and choose what to mine.  The attack really doesn't do much other than annoy.
The same incentives happen with blocks, not just transactions.  Nodes will refuse to accept or relay blocks that they can't process, and thus will orphan larger blocks, cutting into the profits of mining such blocks.
Can you describe the scenario you are thinking of in more specific detail, so I can respond to the meat of your concerns in specific rather than general detail?
@_date: 2017-08-09 21:54:19
Do you have any evidence for this theory? UASF topped off and flat-lined pretty quickly. I saw no evidence that miners or users were all that worried about it. Even in this sub, it was getting made fun of quite a bit.  I just don't see any evidence to claim that it had this scare factor impact you're talking about. It stopped gaining any ground after the initial jump from activation.
I'm not saying you're definitely wrong, but I don't see the evidence for what you're claiming.  Whereas when the NYA activated, 85%+ of miners instantly started signaling for it. I don't think it's at all a stretch to say that that's clearly what got segwit activated.
@_date: 2017-01-24 20:27:34
That's not correct.  Those transactions are valid in a non-segwit block without witness data.  They are valid, anyone-can-spend transactions.  Only segwit nodes even know that there's anything weird about them.  As far as non segwit nodes go, there's nothing more to see.
@_date: 2017-01-23 00:18:28


And I would argue that people only accept your definition because you tell them that's the *only* definition and they don't know any better.  When people go posting things like the title of this post we're in, people who don't already know what blocks are and how segwit work only get to see that post title and don't have any other information to work with.

Wow, you deliberately misrepresent my views to make me as malicious as possible, and then say *shame on me*!?  That's low even for you.  No, ass, I am not purposefully trying to confuse people.  I am purposefully trying to make sure they understand exactly what segwit is and is not, and what is gained and what is lost by activating it.  There's no "politics" in that, there is me trying to make sure that **accurate** information about it is presented.  *Shame on you* for deliberately twisting my post so you could attack that new strawman in order to fool others with such lies.
@_date: 2017-01-27 12:55:17
That's correct.  Different implementations of Bitcoin store blocks differently.  But they all consider a "block" to be the exact same set of data, when serialized.  Segwit nodes actually use a different dataset.
@_date: 2017-01-22 01:31:17
Please re-read my comment, since I already covered the witness hash:


Or are you referring to the tx-id merkle root, which is indeed in the header, but which *does not contain any signature data*, since the tx id is calculated without the segwit data.

@_date: 2017-08-09 03:48:24
No, segwit has it's own type of output script.  It's just being wrapped in P2SH to begin with, because all wallets already understand P2SH and can send to it.  Eventually, that will be phased out and segwit addresses (and bare segwit outputs) will be used.
P2SH is redundant/unnecessary for segwit, since segwit already has the benefits of P2SH (i.e. hashing the script and moving the script to the spending tx).  The only reason P2SH is being used at first is to make a smoother transition.
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:13:23

@_date: 2017-08-15 15:50:43
You can also get out of paying the fees for moving Bitcoin off Coinbase by using their multisig vault.  They do transfers between internal Coinbase accounts for free, and the vault is counted as an internal account, so you move your money to your vault for free, and then you have the two keys necessary to immediately get that money.  That creates an unnecessary extra transaction on the blockchain, and usually the fee the require is close to what the current fee rate is, but in the event that they are charging way too high of fees, you can use your vault to get at your money without paying their fee rate.  (Although obviously, you need to pay some reasonable fee to get your tx confirmed.)

If that were true, segwit would be a hard fork.  But you claim it's not.  And my node continues to validate the blockchain based on Bitcoin's rules.  It is a fully validating node.  The fact that you are changing validation rules on your node doesn't concern my node.

Thankfully, we have a hard fork that fits the bill!  2-4 mb is not a threat or bargain.  That was a figure agree upon by some Core devs, and widely acknowledged by everybody to be acceptable for the network.  Additionally, it was explicitly stated that it would be a part of the Core development roadmap going forward.
I'm glad we're in agreement, let's make a 2 to 4 mb fork right now, and throw segwit in with it.  Lightning will be possible, malleability for segwit tx's will be fixed, and the combined on and off-chain capacity increase will allow the network to work again without congestion or an artificially-created fee market.
Sounds great!
@_date: 2016-11-12 06:44:25
The reason you'd want to parse scriptsig is because many outputs will be P2SH and thus a redeem script containing public keys may be in the scriptsig.  Even normal addresses have the public key for that address as part of the scriptsig.  The output is just the address, the *hash* of the public key.
Let me try to clarify.  You have to know how Bitcoin works.
Even though the terminology makes them seem distinct, scriptsig and scriptpubkey are all part of the same thing.  An input references a prior output, and then the current input's scriptsig and the referenced output's scriptpubkey are concatenated together and run as a single Script program.  And as long as OP_TRUE is left on the stack at the end of that program's execution, the transaction is considered valid.
So for example, for normal addresses that start with a "1", the spending transaction has an input with a scriptsig of:
    &lt;signature&gt;&lt;pubkey&gt;
and the referenced output's scriptpubkey is:
    &lt;OP_DUP&gt;&lt;OP_HASH160&gt; hash &lt;OP_EQUALVERIFY&gt;&lt;OP_CHECKSIG&gt;
So you concatenate them together to get the Script program to be executed:
    &lt;signature&gt;&lt;pubkey&gt;&lt;OP_DUP&gt;&lt;OP_HASH160&gt; hash &lt;OP_EQUALVERIFY&gt;&lt;OP_CHECKSIG&gt;
And the software goes left to right pushing each item on the stack.  So it pushes the signature on and the stack looks like this:
    &lt;signature&gt;
Then it pushes the pubkey and the stack looks like this:
    &lt;public key&gt;
    &lt;signature&gt;
Then OP_DUP is run which duplicates the top stack item, so the stack looks like this:
    &lt;public key&gt;
    &lt;public key&gt;
    &lt;signature&gt;
Then OP_HASH160 is run which takes the top item off the stack, hashes it, and puts the hash on the stack, so the stack is:
    hash_of_pubkey
    &lt;public key&gt;
    &lt;signature&gt;
Then the item after HASH160 is pushed on the stack, which is a hash also, so the stack is:
    hash_of_pubkey
    hash_of_pubkey
    &lt;public key&gt;
    &lt;signature&gt;
The OP_EQUALVERIFY is run, which executes OP_EQUAL and then OP_VERIFY immediately afterwards.  OP_EQUAL takes the first two stack items off the top of the stack and compares them to check if they are equal, and puts either OP_TRUE or OP_FALSE on top of the stack.  So after OP_EQUAL is run, if the hash160 is indeed the correct hash of the public key, the stack looks liek this:
    OP_TRUE
    &lt;public key&gt;
    &lt;signature&gt;
And if would be OP_FALSE if the hash didn't match.  Then OP_VERIFY is run which checks if the top stack item is OP_TRUE, and if it is, it removes it from the stack and continues executing the script, but if the top item is not OP_TRUE, it makes the script stop and fail.  So if the top item is not OP_TRUE, the script fails, and it it is OP_TRUE, then that TRUE just gets popped off the stack, so the stack is now again:
    &lt;public key&gt;
    &lt;signature&gt;
And then OP_CHECKSIG is run, which takes the top two stack items off the stack and assumes they are a public key and a signature, and it attempts to validate them that way.  If the two stack items are not correctly formatted (or aren't a signature and public key) or if they are a bad signature/pubkey combo, it puts OP_FALSE onto the stack, and if they are a good sig/pubkey combo, it puts OP_TRUE on the stack.  So the stack is left with just a single OP_TRUE or OP_FALSE after everything has been executed.  And finally, if the script has executed fully without failing, the software checks to see that there is one remaining stack item and that it is OP_TRUE.  And if that's the case, the transactions is valid.  (Or at least, that specific input is valid.)
But as you can see from how that process works, you can stick a public key anywhere you want.  It can be in the scriptsig or the scriptpubkey.  The software doesn't care where the hell you put it, because it just slaps scriptsig and scriptpubkey together and attempts to run/validated that combined script.
So that's why you should parse both scriptsigs and also scriptpubkeys for public keys, because they really can go anywhere.  In a redeem script that is within a scriptsig, or in a scriptsig not as part of a redeem script.  Or in an output scriptpubkey.
The picture you provided will certainly pickup all addresses that are used as outputs, but remember, addresses are *hashes* of public keys.  So if you want to find the corresponding public keys or redeem scripts for addresses, you'll need to parse the scriptsig and scriptpubkey completely -- that is, you'll need to learn how the Script language actually works and be able to parse it by each stack item, and regex to find public key stack items.

I like how you "prove" me wrong by assuming your own wrong view is correct.  Tech growth absolutely is not merely relevant, it is the MOST relevant aspect.  Tech growth allows for, among other things, innovations which make the GFW less effective.  If you limit things to the lowest common denominator, you stifle everybody.  If you instead limit things to a fairly low but moving barrier, and also focus on creating technology which moves the LCD up to that bar, you create a growing system that can still cater to everybody but isn't stuck.  Rather than stopping at the GFW, spend some of the effort on fixing/bypassing the GFW so you don't *have* to stop there in order to make sure everybody has access.  That's technological innovation.  And that is a part of the answer.
I also think it's extremely funny how the specific concern you're worried about we already know isn't a problem.  China is already the leading Bitcoin country in terms of users and miners, and already heavily invests in getting around the GFW because they personally benefit from participation of the outside world.  If you didn't think block and transaction propagation were that big of an issue a few years ago, you have nothing to worry about moving forward, at least with regards to the GFW.
But please, by all means, bring forth more ludicrously retarded arguments.  I like softballs.

Yeah do your plan to move coins around and make a new Trezor seed.
You should never type your words into the phone.  The phone will never need them.  That's the whole point of the Trezor -- your private keys are only ever on it.  Mycellium only needs to know your public addresses, so it can look for your money.  But then when it makes transactions, you plug in your Trezor and the Trezor signs those transactions with your private keys and tells Mycellium the signature.  But the secret private keys never leave the device for any of that.  You should never enter your seed anywhere.  The private keys should only ever be on the Trezor.

As mentioned in my other post, a non-segwit miner can include a transaction that looks like a valid anyone-can-spend transaction, but to segwit nodes is an invalid segwit transaction.

They have incentive to increase the load up to a certain point, a point past which other nodes start ignoring them and their orphan rate goes through the roof.

I don't need to trust The Devs™ or anybody else at their word, because I can read and understand the source code.  I know how Bitcoin works.
That said, it is wise of you to defer to known experts when you are not knowledgable enough about a topic to make your own determination.  I hesitate to correct you because I don't want you to think that approach is a bad idea -- it very much is a good idea.  It is impossible for any one person to know everything, and we must often defer to others to inform us on topics about which we are not able to make accurate judgments.  Choosing the correct people is a difficult task, and you have done well by choosing, for the most part, the correct people.
In this specific case, it has led you only very slightly astray.  The Devs™ have started calling what I referred to above as "block data + witness data" as just "block data", for the sake of simplifying the explanation of how segwit works to people like you who don't know much about it.  That is an easy semantic thing to do and doesn't really confuse the issue, unless you start getting into specifics like I have here.
As far as segwit nodes are concerned "block data + witness data" is effecitively lumped together and is all one thing.  So it's easy to lump them together when explaining it.
The problem is that that's not actually accurate when you're talking about what's really going on.
The Bitcoin blockchain can be trusted because it can be verified.  Every transaction in a block (usually) requires a cryptographic signature which can be verified.  This marks the transaction as valid.  Then a bunch of transactions get lumped together into a "block".  That block is considered valid if, among other things, all of its transactions are valid.  Segwit takes the signatures out of transactions and puts them somewhere else, and then it replaces them with a piece of code that segwit nodes interpret as "go check the signatures in that other area", but which non-segwit nodes interpret as "this transaction doesn't require a signature, it's valid".  So when a node is going through and validating the blockchain, if it's not a segwit node it just sees that and says "oh ok, everything's good here" and moves on, without actually verifying the signature.  As far as the blockchain goes, there are no signatures.
Only segwit nodes are able to see that and know that they still need to go verify the transaction with that other data (the witness data) that is not part of the block.
That's what makes this a soft fork -- because it doesn't "break" old nodes that don't upgrade.  They are able to "validate" a block as being all good and having valid transactions, without any knowledge of segwit or witness data, because to them, the transaction looks like it doesn't need a signature.
I very much disagree with that approach, because with a hard fork -- where you just break old clients -- those clients at least know they need to upgrade and cannot validate transactions until they do.  But with this segwit approach, they mistakenly believe they are still validating transactions, when in fact they are not.
The reason devs say "segwit makes the blocksize bigger", is because as far as segwit nodes go, it doesn't matter to them that the blocksize and witness data are different sets of data -- they still have to download and process and check and relay all of the data.  So they have to do as much work as they would if there was no segwit and it was just a straight-up blocksize increase.  It's functionally the same for them.  So it's just easier to explain it that way.  It's only non-segwit nodes that don't get that extra information, and where the distinction becomes relevant.
The reason I make such a big deal about the distinction is because of how Bitcoin's proof of work security model works.  The hash that is the proof of work, covers every aspect of block data, so in order to be valid, you know all transactions are valid as well.  But with segwit, that's no longer true.  A non-segwit node may get a block that has a valid hash and looks like it has all valid transactions, but those transactions are ones which segwit nodes consider invalid.  The non-segwit node has no way of determining if the block is valid or not.  The ability to verify the blockchain is *involuntarily taken away* from non-segwit nodes.  And that fact is hidden from them.
That's why it's important to understand the difference between the block data and the witness data, because Bitcoin's proof of work -- its entirely security model -- is drastically changed.
There's plenty of counterarguments for my view, and segwit isn't as bad as I make out here -- it will probably be fine, even if I disagree with it in principle.  But we're not talking about that here.  All we're talking about here is the size of the block data in the Bitcoin blockchain.  And that, which is distinct and separate from segwit witness data, will remain at one megabyteb.  When The Devs™ told you the blocksize was being increased to 2.1mb, what they really meant was the "block + witness data" size would be increased to 2.1mb, but they didn't want to get into a long discussion about the difference between block data and witness data.
I hope I have explained things clearly.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask.  You can also get a good conceptual idea of how Bitcoin works by watching [this video]( as a starting point.

As others have said, having any device with open ports leaves you open to attack.  As long as you have a router or firewall or something setup to block every other port and only allow Bitcoin's port, you'll be fine.  Bitcoin by default has attack prevention mechanisms in it, so no further setup for Bitcoin is needed, but you need to make sure every other port is closed.
Attack bots are constantly scanning every IPv4 address.  As soon as you connect a device to the internet, it will be port scanned.  For example, I have a machine with ssh open and I get different IP addresses attempting to ssh into my machine every minute or two.
So be careful.  But if you close every other port, you'll be fine.  You should be able to install something like UFW on a Pi, and there's pretty simple instructions for setting that up.  Set the default to deny all incoming and allow all outgoing, and then add a rule to allow incoming traffic to port 8333.  That will protect it just fine.  (You may also want to allow ssh if you ssh into it, but make sure you have it setup correctly and only use public keys and have fail2ban on for it, because you will get people trying to brute force ssh nonstop 24/7.)

If you're going to base the block size by the lowest common technological denominator, Bitcoin simply cannot work.  The vast majority of third world people are more than happy to use spv clients - they don't even care about trust, they just care if it works. So if you price them out, they don't give a shit that their rich can verify the blockchain. And their rich can afford bigger blocks anyway.

No you could do it without LN.  You and I could do one right now with say some namecoin and some bitcoin.  There just needs to be a time lock mechanism and the ability to prove a secret in order to have a valid tx.  Luckily bitcoin has time locks, and addresses being hashes require public keys to be in the scriptsig, so a public key can be used as a secret that hashes to a known hash (an address).  That way, signing a transaction with that address necessarily reveals the public key (the secret) and allows the other party to broadcast their transaction which requires their signature and knowledge of what the other guy's public key is.
@_date: 2017-01-29 12:17:40
It is yes.  Unless and until we have similar levels of security and open access available for the poorest among us.  I will not price out the poorest in order to keep secure the richest, especially when keeping everybody secure is still feasible, like it is now.  I run and mine on a BU node for that exact reason.
If keeping the poor priced in does start to harm the overall security of the system, I may change my mind -- obviously, security is the most important thing; otherwise Bitcoin is useless.  But I think Bitcoin is at risk of being over-protected.  It does not need to be "perfectly secure".  It needs only to be secure enough to withstand state level adversaries.  Adding more security than that, at the expense of users, is a gross mis-alignment of priorities.
@_date: 2017-01-27 14:53:08


You just said somebody shouldn't use it for $4 purchases.


And I'm against that if that hurts the security properties of Bitcoin.  Which it currently very much does.  Just remember, decentralization isn't the end goal here. Decentralization is a means to an end. The purpose of decentralization is to ensure that a ledger is trustworthy and censorship-proof in an environment where everybody is untrusted and state-level actors are attacking it. Decentralization helps protect Bitcoin's ledger in that environment.... but if those security measures are possible in other ways, that's fine too.


No, it's really not.  Every other aspect of Bitcoin has always been agreed upon as being set in stone.  The block size was widely regarded as needing to be changed, by the majority of the community, until about 2014.  That is not true of any other setting.


Really?  The guy who lives in a repressive regime and has no other method of protecting the little bit of money he has, and no other method of sending that money to his starving family.... Bitcoin is of *no value* to him?  The villager in Africa who has one cell phone for the whole village and whose only means of becoming part of the global economy is Bitcoin...  it has *no value to him*?

Those addresses will likely be for segwit outputs.  The 3 addresses are general P2SH addresses.
Basically, you can wrap any script you want, segwit and multisig included, into a P2SH address, or you can not use P2SH and just have the script itself in the output.  For example, you can put a 2-of-3 address as an output.  (Or a segwit address.)  But it's cleaner to have it wrapped in a P2SH address, because that protects the keys by having them hashed, and it moves the sizable script (and thus higher fees) to the sender.
Segwit scripts also do those two things, so it's a little redundant and unnecessary to wrap them in P2SH.  The reason we're starting off doing that is because everybody (and all wallet software) is familiar with P2SH already, so it's easier to roll out.

By whom?  Using what argument?


Yeah I saw the same video and slides you did about his testnet tests, and he absolutely did not conclude 8MB was unsafe.


I've also read that paper carefully and seen how that figure was derived.  If you look closely at it, you'll see that they just made up the numbers they were basing everything on.  Not that those were necessarily bad assumptions to make.... but when you're talking about a hard cap of 4mb as a conclusion to draw, when a slight change in the *numbers they made up* yields very different results, I can't say I'm convinced by the conclusion.


Again, I remind you that community vote doesn't actually dictate the technological capacity of the network.

Exactly.  Which is why the proof of work hash is supposed to go over every aspect of every transaction.  Non-segwit nodes don't see signatures, don't know what the coinbase witness hash means, and *still validate the block as valid*.
You say that you think a block should contain all the data that affects validity, yet you support removing the ability of nodes to validate blocks!

They shouldn't.  We both agree they should have access to them.  My claim is that you're pushing for things that go against that.  You think you're helping them, but you're actually hurting them.


Sort of.  A LN hub can fuck over its participants, it just costs more to do it than the gain.  There is still trust though.  Perhaps a hub will be setup as a loss leader for a government or business.  I claim that this risk and other problems and issues with Lightning make it less suitable for the poor than on-chain scaling.  I believe on chain scaling, while more costly than LN, is still cheap enough that decentralization will be preserved and even the poorest will be better protected and better able to verify and be a part of the trustless nature of Bitcoin.
LN is nice, and there's no reason not to have it as an option, but it is not fair nor accurate to call it trustless and to say that it's acceptable to make it the only option available.

No, there are plenty of free and paid services that offer API's and other integration services.  If you want to do most of it yourself though, it's really not that much extra effort to just use something like Insight and spend a day or two writing your own APIs or finding ones others have made for it.
Also, make sure to use HSTS on your site.  Bitcoin sites are huge targets for attacks and phishing and Tor exit nodes are known to rewrite Bitcoin addresses on unencrypted pages.  So always use SSL/TLS for everything not going localhost to localhost.  That's good practice anyway, but doubly true for Bitcoin sites.

In that case, you'd need to parse every output and scriptsig, using Script stack items, and look at individual stack items and see if they are a regex match for public key format.
You know the Bitcoin transaction format, and Script stack-based programming?  If you do, you can certainly do what you are proposing.  You could do it with Bitcoin Core, but I'd recommend something like Bitpay's Insight to do it faster.
Then you just have a script run every time a block is found to parse the new block.
@_date: 2016-12-07 23:06:29
I mean, there's really no such thing as that either.  If I send a ton of transactions, all of which have value to me, is that a dos attack?  Well... sort of, and also not really.  My *intention* isn't to dos the network, even if that is the effect.  Once again, node settings can fix this.  If too many transactions are coming in and that's a problem for your node, you can make your node drop and not relay transactions based on fee rate or whatever rules you want to set.
If enough people aren't relaying your transactions, and/or enough miners aren't mining them, you will notice that your transactions aren't confirming, and you will either wait it out or start upping your fees.  If you're just making junk transactions to spam the network, that's not too big of a problem because again, nodes can easily just drop them.  So who cares.  Ok now the mempool is much bigger and there's a backlog of transactions.... but so what?  If nodes don't like that, they can, as mentioned, drop such transactions.  And miners still prioritize to get the most fees and yours will still not be included.
So that doesn't really accomplish much either.  You may have noticed that every time there is a "spam attack" on the network.... that nothing really happens.  Bitcoin keeps on trucking along.  Some transactions take longer to confirm because not all nodes and miners have properly configured their nodes to drop junk transactions, so some of the junk gets included and takes up the block space, and pushes other transactions out.... but that's actually pretty rare.  Because of the incentives.  It behooves miners to get the most fees they can, so they generally drop low fee transactions anyway.  Other than extra bandwidth, processing power, and memory being used, there's nothing bad that happens.  And the increase in those resources is pretty small in all honesty, even for very large "attacks" with many many transactions.
What type of situation do you think happens that really legitimately hinders the network via a large amount of transactions being broadcast and relayed?  I have yet to see such an occurrence.  I've seen my mempool get big and have 200k transactions, but the software handled it just fine and kept right on trucking.  (I have happened to configure my node to accept, relay, and mine, the vast majority of transactions, including a lot of what other people would consider spam.)

Not using the standard Bitcoin clients, but yes, it's absolutely possible.  I even wrote a little [python app]( a few years back to do exactly that.  It creates a random key, multiplies the recipients public key with the random private key, symetrically encrypts the message with the hash of the resulting public key (which is a shared secret), and then spits out a base64 encoding of the random key's public key and the encrypted message, which can be decrypted with the private key of the recipient, but nobody else, since key multiplication requires a public key and a private key.
It's not very pretty and has a lot of coding sloppiness.  I was just learning to code when I wrote it.  But it works.
@_date: 2016-11-18 00:13:30
Think of an address as its own mini-wallet.  You can receive money to it and spend from it.  When you spend from it, due to a quirk in how Bitcoin works, you MUST spend ALL of the money you receive.  So what ends up happening is you send money to two addresses -- one to pay whoever you're sending money, and one to get the change back to yourself.  (So if you have 3 bitcoins and want to spend one, you'd have a transaction that paid somebody 1 and paid yourself back 2.)
That second change address can be the exact same address you just sent from, but most wallets choose an entirely different address, for a variety of reasons we won't get into here.  You can technically only ever have and use one single address, and always have your change get put back into it, but that's a bad idea for some complex security reasons.  So most wallets just use multiple addresses.  That's why you get one "seed" that can be used to regenerate all the private keys and addresses.  So you only have one thing to remember rather than having to save 20 different private keys.
So if you send money from one of your addresses, the leftover amount will go back into one of those 20 addresses, probably the next one down on the list.
You can get the private key for one of your addresses, but then if you spend the money and the leftover change gets moved to another address, then your private key for the original address will be useless to you.  That's why you should just backup the seed instead, because the seed can be used to regenerate the private keys for all of your addresses.
@_date: 2016-12-07 02:15:34
Yes.  If the exchange is in trouble, your risk is they never give you your money back.
And in Bitcoin especially, when many exchanges aren't licensed or registered, you don't really have much legal recourse either.
But of course, as others have mentioned, any money on any exchange is at risk.  When you have your money in your hand, it's YOUR money.  When an exchange or bank or anybody else has it, you have nothing but an IOU and the hope that they won't lose it or that the law will help you get it back if they do.  You have IOU's and hope.  Not money.
In the normal non-Bitcoin world, IOU's and hope may be good enough for you.  But in the Bitcoin world especially, where many exchanges are unregulated and outright fraudulent, you should always exercise extreme caution and only ever keep small amounts on an exchange, and move it off the exchange as soon as you can.

You're misinformed about how the segwit2x hard fork is going to activate.  It activates, and only considers valid, a chain mined on top of a block at height 494784, and block 494784 **must** be larger than 1MB.  That is when the fork occurs and that is the only chain segwit2x considers valid.  Now block 494784 may get ro-org'd and a new block replaces it, but segwit2x will only build on top of it if it is greater than 1MB in size.  That is the official segwit2x activation block and it will be greater than 1MB.  If it is not larger than 1MB, segwit2x clients will consider it invalid.

You could totally do it as a soft fork.  You just stick your reference block and associated data outside the blockchain, and any nodes who want to use your system can request the reference block from other soft-forked nodes.  Then they request the more recent blocks from other non-forked full nodes.  And they can verify everything based on that... well, everything you've laid out in your security model.  (They would no longer be full nodes though, as they would not have the entire history of the blockchain... but of course that's intentional.)

No, they are running compatible implementations.  BU ensures such compatibility by allowing you to decide if and when you abandon your settings for the sake of not forking off the network.  You can set that as arbitrarily restrictive as you wish.  Setting EB=1mb,AD=9999999 in BU is a perfectly viable option, and will ensure you are never on a chain larger than 1mb.


And if you can't afford to use the network because the other costs are so high, then you have to trust Visa and Paypal.


The purpose of node counts is to protect decentralization.  And the purpose of protecting decentralization is to block censorship.  If you force transactions to cost so much that people can't afford them, then they are *effectively* censored, and the entire purpose is likewise defeated.  To make the example very extreme, if 5 people in the world can use bitcoin, nobody really cares if their transactions are protected.

Exactly, and since miners and users want coins they know they know they can spend, there is strong incentive for everybody to converge onto one chain.  Some people, like Luke-Jr and his graphic calculator that can only handle 100kb blocks, will drop off the network, but most players will remain.  And in the BU scenario, ridiculously high block sizes will be outliers that get left behind as the super majority converges on a chain that everybody in said super majority can process.  So the extreme upper and lower bounds will get cut off, and the majority middle will be what the block size actually ends up being.

Your seed is specific to Electrum... but it follows a well-known format, so anybody with any programming knowledge could use it to derive the keys that they would be able to import into other wallets.
A private key is the right to spend money from an address.  A seed is a sort of "master" private key that you can use to derive all of the private keys for all your addresses.  All wallets understand what private keys are, but not all of them will understand what your seed is.

For nodes that use default settings.  Unlike mine, which relays and mines non-standard and low and zero fee transactions.


You don't.  That's the entire point.  Segwit transactions do not include signature data.  That's why it's called segwit -- segregated witness -- the "witness" being the thing that sees the transaction is valid aka the signature... and the "segregated" being not in the block.
Do you even ~~lift bro~~ know what segwit is or how it works?

Yes I saw your post when you posted it earlier.  Full nodes don't need perfect connections though, as long as they can get blocks reasonably fast.  They aren't fighting milliseconds because their mining profit goes down if they get orphaned.  If full nodes take a minute to get a block, that's pretty much fine.  The argument against bigger blocks, according to many Core devs, and yourself, has always been about block propagation and validation between miners.  You lot have already admitted that hard disk space and validation for non-mining full nodes has much more wiggle room.  If you're telling me now that that's no longer the argument, then you've basically come full circle and defeated all of your own arguments already.

You should make sure you set your systcl to never use the swapfile unless it's truly out of ram.  Any swapfile usage is going to significantly slow things down.  That's why I recommending tweaking everything and running the bare minimum and then setting your dbcache to 1300.  (I thought your Pi had 2gb ram not one.)  The idea is that you aren't going over the ram you have, so that there is no swapfile IO slowing things down.
However, now knowing that you have only one gig of ram, I'm not sure what is best.  You're already going to run into some other bottlenecks, so the HDD read/write of the swapfile might not make as big of a difference.  So maybe nevermind on my last paragraph.  If you've found a setting that works, go with that.  I don't know what the best settings for a 1gb ram Pi are.

Users absolutely have power in blocksize.  I can set my fully validating but non-forwarding BU node to reject a too-big chain.  I can also set my forwarding BU full node to not relay too large of blocks, so that huge blocks simply don't propagate.  As a business owner, I can require N confirmations on the longest chain with a block of size X within the last Y blocks.
There is economic incentive all around for everybody to converge on one chain.  That includes miners who mine blocks that don't get relayed and give them coins they can't spend.

This has to do with some complicated elliptic curve math.
Basically, there's a special properly of elliptic curve multiplication (which is different from regular multiplication) such that the following two equations are true:
    pubkey1 * privkey2 = pubkey3
    privkey1 * pubkey2 = pubkey3
(And the asterisk in the equation is elliptic curve multiplication.)
So as you can see, if you have your own private key (and obviously, you would also have your public key too), and you have my public key, you can multiply your private key with my public key, and get a secret result (pubkey3 from above) that nobody else but me can derive, and I derive it with your public key and my private key.
Nobody else can derive it, because as you can see in the equations above, it requires at least one private key, either yours or mine, in order to do the equation.  If somebody only has both of our public keys, they cannot derive pubkey3.
So the random key doesn't have to be random -- it can be my own personal key.  But its public key has to be public and unenecrypted, so that you can see it and plug it into the equation.  I use that random key's private key and multiply it by your public key to derive a "shared secret" (pubkey3 in the equation above), and then I encrypt the message using AES with that shared secret as the password.  Then I give you the random public key, and you use it and your own private key to recreate that secret password, so you can decrypt the message.
So the actual "encrypted" message I send you is:
    [Unencrypted random public key] + [Encrypted message]
As you can see, the public key is not in any way concealed.  Because you need it to be able to use it to derive the secret password before you can decrypt the message.
So the reason it is a random key is for identity protection.  If I want you to know it was me that sent the message, I can just sign the message with my key and then the "message" that gets encrypted by my app is actually "sig+message".  And I'd still use a random key to encrypt the sig+message combo.
Or you can use your own key instead of the random one, but then anybody who intercepts the message knows you sent it, since they can see the public key and knows it belongs to you.
But you definitely CANNOT make it 1 or any other key that is known or guessable.  It is important that it is a secret and secure private key, whether it's yours or a randomly generated key.  If that key is poorly chosen or otherwise gets compromised, then a bad guy can derive the encryption password.
*Edit:  Also, I want to make sure you understand that a public key is NOT the same thing as an address.  For the equations above, you need a public key.  Which is different from an address.  An address is a hash of a public key, so if all you have is an address, you CANNOT use my tool, since you don't know the public key.*
@_date: 2016-12-28 04:57:03
Yeah, but none of the info in the signed key helps me verify it.  As far as I can find, the keybase account isn't mentioned on the website.  For all I know, the attacker that took over the reddit account also made a keybase user.
So I'm using a keybase user that I don't know for sure belongs to keepkey in order to verify that the pgp key is correct -- do you see the circular logic in that reference?
The JAR signing key was the only pgp public key that I was able to verify from multiple sources belongs to keepkey.  That's the only key I can actually verify belongs to KeepKey.  You guys should really put your PGP keys and/or the keybase user to your website or something.
Don't get me wrong, I'm sure you're you and things are as you say.  I'm just pointing out how difficult it is to actually verify that.  The jar signing key was the only key I could verify definitely belongs to keepkey, and there's no cryptographic link between it and the key you used.  You're telling me to use one source I can't verify in order to verify a different unverified source.  That's not a secure way of verifying things.
Luckily, there IS a secure link between entities known to belong to keepkey and the key you provided.  That link is that the URL to your signed message is an HTTPS url to the keepkey domain.  So it proves that somebody with control of the domain published the message.  That's a secure link.  But had you, for example, published that signed message here on reddit and not linked to it on your site, there would be no way to verify it -- only the previously mentioned circular verification.
Sorry, I don't mean to be a pain in the ass, especially when you're going through this giant hassle.  I'm just trying to point out the faults in the security assumptions being made.  A signed message is only useful if it is known or can be proved that the key used to sign the message belongs to you.
From google searching and looking at your website, the jar signing key was the only key I could verify belongs to keepkey.  That's why I requested a signature from it specifically.

That is true not just for miners but for everybody.  There really is no such thing as spam.  Only what users are willing to relay, and what miners are willing to mine.  If the fee is sufficiently high, then the transaction is more valuable to somebody, which means to them it's not spam, and if a miner is willing to mine it, he doesn't consider it spam either.  "Spam" is an etheral concept which means "transactions I don't like".  It's not an actual thing in objective reality, it's entirely subjective.  If it gets relayed and mined, it's not spam.  Each node is free to configure his settings however he wants.

Yes, it's all automatic in Electrum.  As far as you are concerned, you can give anybody any of the addresses in the list to pay you, and when you spend money, it will know which addresses have money and it will deal with doing the change properly.  You don't have to think about anything.  Just send money in the send money tab and it will figure it all out.

Unfortunately for you, I absolutely do.  If you'd care to test our comparative knowledge on bitcoin, programming, economics, or logic, I'd be happy to oblige.


They *can*, they just won't have coins that they can trade or sell.  And the users would have coins without very much confidence/protection due to a near non-existent hashrate on their chain.


Incorrect.  BU *allows users* to decide if and how much they get "pushed".  If you are on BU set your blocksize to 1mb and your acceptance depth to 9999999, then you're running a 1mb client that doesn't get "pushed around".  It's basically the same as the Core client if you do that.  (You might have to tweak the sigops check too, but you get the idea.)


There's nothing preventing them from doing that **now**.  Except that they know that users and exchanges would consider those blocks invalid.  The same is true for BU, except the users and exchanges get to decide what they consider valid rather than having it set for them.


Once again, no no no, that's not how any of this works.  At no point do you EVER have to trust miners.  There is no trust that magically gets implemented into the system via BU.  You still have rules for validation, and you still validate against those rules.  It's just that one variable is now user-defined that wasn't before, and so you have to be cognizant of what everybody else is doing.  But nowhere in BU, nor in any other block size proposal, is the 21M coin limit changing to be user defined.  If a miner mines extra coins, your BU node, and all other nodes, will consider the block invalid, no matter how big or small it is.  You're simply wrong about the impact and implications of user-defined block-sizes.  Nothing works the way you are claiming it does.  Full nodes still do validation, no matter what the blocksize is.


That's a personal judgement.  There is a cap on computational power that individual nodes can do, which caps the amount of transactions that Bitcoin can handle.  So at some point, making sure the little guy can run a node means that the little guy also can't afford a transaction, because blockspace is limited because we were making sure the little guy could run a node.  If the blocksize is 2kb then everybody could run a node, but nobody could actually use the network.  There has to be some middle ground.  I happen to think that having a home node be expensive but possible is a good middle ground -- enough people will run nodes that decentralization will be preserved, but at the same time, the network isn't bottlenecked by the requirements of the least common denominator.
Additionally, you must recognize that the trust you talk about comes down to resources, aka money.  If nodes are inexpensive to run at home, fees for transactions are more expensive.  If mining wasn't as expensive, it would be cheaper to 51% attack the blockchain.  Every aspect of the system is about incentives and resource trade-offs.

That's an opinion on how node operators think, not on what the software actually does.  The software reads NOP and continues on.  It doesn't stop and ask around "hey other nodes, I found this NOP, what do I do?"


No, that characterization is only accurate when applied to upgrading to segwit.  Segwit is not a blocksize increase and therefore a blocksize increase using segwit is fundamentally impossible, since that's not what segwit does.

Sorry.  Keys that start with "xpub" are always public HD keys.  Private HD keys always begin with "xprv".  So you get some master xprv key, which you can use to derive child xpub and xprv keys, and then you can derive the child key's address from the xpub key.  So when somebody pays you, all they see is the address, not the public key, and of course, not the private key.
Because of the way HD wallets work, if you have an xpub public key, you can derive its "parent" public key.  But you'd need the public key, not just the address.
Is that more clear?  If not, don't be afraid to say so.  I'm happy to stay and try to clear things up as much as possible.  I don't want to be confusing!

The miners can still put a fake hash into that reference block though.  At some point, your ability to verify the past is halted, and it is at that point that you "trust" the miners, because you can't verify the past beyond that point.  Now, you could set that point at 100k blocks and just have a rolling 100k past and figure that's good enough... and there have been proposals in alt-coins to do that type of thing.  But Bitcoin's core value proposition isn't "good enough", it's "ironclad".  Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying your idea is bad, I'm just pointing out that it does remove *some* level of verification and thus add in *some* level of trust.  Now, those levels might be small enough that you think they don't matter.  But other people may disagree.  I don't mind your idea, and I think it would be neat for an alt-coin, but I am willing to expend the time, effort, and cost to be able to verify the Bitcoin blockchain since the genesis block.

Yes of course.  Miners choose whatever transactions they want in a block.  If they are all valid transactions, the rest of the network considers the block valid.

Your wallet is very likely still recoverable.  You probably just mis-typed or mis-recorded one word, or left out a word.  Do you have 12 total words?  Check the [word list]( against your words and see if you have any words that aren't on the list and then try replacing it with similar words that are on the list.

Pretty much.  Nobody who understands how Bitcoin works doesn't think it's amazing.

They will not be able to do it, with like a 99.9999% confidence interval.

As always, this tired argument fails to acknowledge the counterargument that the value of the security and decentralization of the system means that the users of the system will stop using it once that value goes away, so the miners and nodes and other "maintainers" have an economic incentive to keep the system secure and decentralized enough to maintain that inherent value proposition, and an equilibrium will be reached between the fee/tx-included-in-block rates and the cost of running a node and mining a block.

The following isn't quite accurate, but it's close enough:  When you get some bitcoin, a quirk of the bitcoin protocol makes it so you have to spend all of it at once.  So if you get 1 bitcoin, and you want to send somebody half a bitcoin, you still have to "use" the entire bitcoin in the transaction.  So Electrum makes a transaction that simultaneously sends the guy you want to pay 0.5, and also sends 0.5 back to you, into another address in your wallet.  It's the "change", the "leftover" money.  Hence calling it a "change address".  And if you later want to send somebody else 0.4, you'll do the process over again, with a transaction that both pays the guy 0.4 and pays you 0.1 into a new address.  Because, as mentioned, you always have to "spend" all of the bitcoin you get when you make a transaction.
Calling it a change address is just a choice by Electrum though.  Wallets just have a bunch of addresses, you can group them and name them however you want.  Electrum just calls them change addresses so it's clear for you the user to see and understand that the money in those addresses is the change from your previous transactions.
Now to explain why what I said "wasn't quite accurate" (as I said in my first sentence above).  What I said is true, except you don't have to spend all your bitcoins at once... you have to spend all bitcoins *from a single transaction* at once.  So if Bob pays you 0.6 bitcoins, and Dave pays you 0.4 bitcoins, and you want to send Adam 0.3, you would either choose to use the money from Bob's payment to you or from Dave's payment, and you would have to use all of it, and send the change back to yourself.
Bitcoin is at its heart just a ledger -- a record book -- of transactions.  A pays B, B pays C, C pays D, and so forth.  You can follow every transaction backwards in time to when the coins were first "mined" in a block.  And the way the record keeping works, once you reference a previous transaction to fund a new one, you cannot reference it again.  Thus you have to spend all of its money when you make a new transaction, or else you just lose that money and it goes to miners.  So in order to "spend" all of the money, you just pay yourself back the remainder in your new transaction, and then you reference that new transaction for your next transaction payment.

Block propogation is the same between miners as it is between any other full nodes.
If you're going to claim "but miners are better connected and have things like the Bitcoin Relay Network", then congratulations, you've already proved the point that miners can easily handle bigger blocks, and that bigger blocks don't add any centralizing pressure that isn't already present and being exploited in the system currently.

Again though, you are now completely trusting miners.


No, you absolutely do NOT trust the longest chain.  You verify every aspect of it.  Having the most hashing power behind it does not make it valid.  You still verify it and make sure it's valid.  There is no trust involved.


How?  What new rules can you make that would do that.  Right now, the rules are "verify its accuracy since the beginning of time".  If you know of a better algorithm, you can replace Bitcoin and will have a major technological breakthrough.  The whole purpose of Bitcoin is ensuring that an accurate ledger exists in an untrusted and adversarial environment.


Only if one was around when the reference block was made and verified.  How do new nodes verify that the reference block was correct?  They can't, they trust the miners.


Yes, you're always trusting past the point from which you are unable to verify.  That's my whole point.  That may be 100k blocks and you're pretty sure it's good, but you're still trusting beyond that point.  And that's my whole point.  At some point, your proposal loses the ability to verify the past actually happened.
Not to mention that if I don't trust the most recent reference block, that means I also don't trust any new transactions.  So waiting for confirmations takes... years... if I don't trust the most recent reference block.
You are fundamentally changing the security parameters of the system, and removing the ability to verify everything.  Remember, as I mentioned above, the longest chain with the most hashing power is NOT the de facto real chain, the longest VALID chain is.  When you take away the ability to verify the chain, you take away the entire security properties of the system.
Additionally, you can accomplish the same benefits you want without having to change anything in the protocol.  Just build a client that allows you to import and export a utxo set and block at a specific block, and has pruning enabled.  You can then request a utxo set from any set of people you are willing to trust, and bootstrap from that.  That way, you can remove the trust yourself for your node, without removing the ability of other people to verify history if they want to.  Plus, you get additional security, because in the event that there is some long huge history re-write, some nodes on the network will be able to handle it, and you can re-bootstrap from them.
Actually, hmmm, this is kind of an interesting idea.  I might have to go look into what it would take to dump the utxo set at a certain block, and how to import and bootstrap from a dumped set.
@_date: 2017-01-25 08:54:00
No that's not possible, not with any number of addresses.  They would need at a minimum an xpub child key, which you have no reason to give out.

It doesn't matter.  Per day or per week are slightly better, because you are buying slightly more than if you did $3k per month, and since on average the price will rise, buying more is better.  Thus daily or weekly is the best answer.  But it really doesn't matter which you do.
If you're looking to reduce variance, then you should change the amount you want to buy to account for that.  Changing *when* you buy isn't a way to alter your risk.
Also, dollar cost averaging is a completely useless metric.  Whether or not you decide to buy or sell some amount of Bitcoin today depends on what you think Bitcoin will do in the future.  Your assessment of its risk and its potential reward, and your life situation and tolerance for risk.  None of that has anything to do with what you paid for it previously.  If it's $700 today, your investment decision should depend on what you think it will do tomorrow.  Whether you paid $500 last week or $1000 last week doesn't matter.  All that matters is that it's $700 now.  (Being $1k or $500 previously may factor into your equation for what it's likely to do tomorrow, but you're still only using that price as past historical data, it doesn't matter that you bought them at that time.)  Your past purchases simply are not part of the equation for determining whether something is a good investment now or in the future.  Whether you are down or up in your investing has nothing to do with whether a current investment is going to be wise or unwise.  The only reason the past matters is because it determines your current risk threshold and investment amount.  But you are still only using those current factors in your decision.  If you have $10k to invest right now, it doesn't matter if you had $5k or $15k yesterday.  All that matters, the only useful metric, is that you have $10k now.

You don't need them to access your multisig vault. You have two of the keys. It's just more of a pain to do it yourself than use their JavaScript implementation. They genuinely do not have control. It's a 2-of-3 where they have one key and an encrypted version of another key that is only decrypted locally in the browser when you use their site.

How would you know it's verified?  Let's say you're a new node on the network trying to bootstrap and get up-to-date... how do you verify that the last reference block valid?  How do you know its utxo set was valid?  You have no ability to check the history to verify that yourself.  The only way you can be sure everything is verified is if you've been online since the beginning and been verifying as you go... but new nodes to the network do not have the ability to see that history.

And no, BU is not introducing a whole new level of uncertainty.  It's merely exacerbating an uncertainty that already exists.  It's slightly increasing the orphan/fork rate, which slightly lowers the confidence of 1 or 2 confirmations.

What are you trying to do exactly?  Use your Electrum wallet on Mycelium?  Or just backup your wallet.  If you want to just back it up, just write down the words it gave you.  Even if Electrum goes backrupt, the process they use for turning the words into private keys is well known.  I personally have a python script I wrote myself to do it.  So you will always find a way to get your private keys if you have that list of words.  You should always only backup the words.  You don't need anything else, the words are enough.
If on the other hand your goal is to use the same wallet on Electrum and Mycelium, that is possible, but it is tricky.  If that's what you're trying to do, I can walk you through how to do it, but it'll be a bit annoying.  It would be better to use different wallets for both, and then just write backup the words both wallets give you somewhere.  (As mentioned, all you ever need are the words. Even if the companies go under or your computer crashes, with the words, you will always be able to get at your money.  The recovery process might be cumbersome, but it will always be possible.

There is no rule-maker who sets the price.  People who want to buy bitcoin go to an exchange, as do people who want to sell it, and they just offer any price they want, and if a buyer is willing to buy and a seller is willing to sell that's the "official" price.  The exchanges all converge on the same price, because people have accounts on multiple exchanges and any difference between them is quickly and easily exploited by buying on one and selling on another.... until they do that so much the price converges between the two exchanges to be the same.
It's no different than you offering to sell me a baseball card for $2 and I say I'll pay $1 and then we settle on $1.50 and make the trade.  Now the price of baseball cards is $1.50.  Nobody forced that to be the price.  There was no authority setting the price.  It just sort of came out of thin air.
That's really all that's happening.  Even in really big markets.  It's just people setting their own prices.  When more people use Bitcoin or there's good press, more people think that other people will want more of it and so they sell it for higher prices.  And so the "official" price goes up.
There's no magic behind it.  It's just people trading baseball cards.
That's how markets work.  That's how the price of gold or of a company stock is determined.

BTC-e is known to be run anonymously.  Any corporate info you find will be shell companies that lead nowhere.  They continually setup new shell companies to get bank accounts to do withdraws and deposits for fiat.
As much as that may seem shady as shit, they are also the longest running Bitcoin exchange and for the most part have not had any major incidents.
Still, trying to deposit or withdraw fiat on an anonymous exchange is... unwise.  Given their reputable history, I'd say it's likely you'll get your money and it will just take a while.  But still, they are anonymous and you have zero recourse if things go bad.  Your research will just lead to dead ends.
In the future, it's best to only keep small amounts with them (or any exchange), and if you want to cashout, buy Bitcoin and cashout in a safer exchange.

Yeah, I understand that to segwit nodes, it's all the same thing, and it's only stripped and serialized to send to non-segwit nodes.  I'm talking about the perspective from the non-segwit node.  The non-segwit node doesn't understand what the witness hash in the coinbase is, and thus can't validate it.  But it still thinks the transaction is valid, because it's not even aware of segwit or that it was *supposed* to validate that data.
And given that a block can be validated without witness data, I don't think that witness data should be called part of the block when you are defining what you mean by block.  That's just semantics for the name though.  You seem to think, based on another reply, that I am claiming segwit does not provide a capacity increase.  That is not what I am claiming, and it absolutely does provide a capacity increase.  I'm just arguing as semantic point here about the definition of the word "block".  Segwit is indeed a capacity increase.  It just isn't a blocksize increase.

No, it's not.  It's a complex hack to remove signature validation from blocks and cause all nodes that disagree with it to no longer be able to validate blocks and transactions, causing them to mine and relay blocks that other nodes may consider invalid.  It "makes extra space" by removing signatures from the transaction.  That's hardly on par with a block size increase.

Well you claimed the proof that Mike Hearn didn't understand what gave Bitcoin its value was that he sold a bunch at a lower price.  That's pretty damned close to claiming its usefulness is directly related to its price.
If that's not the claim, then your point about him selling at a lower price is not evidence of his lack of understanding of Bitcoin and you have thus not answered the original call for evidence.


I think you misunderstand his view on the value of Bitcoin.  I am going to explain **my** view, which I think -- but I could be wrong -- is closer to his view.  It's not about Bitcoin the money -- or rather, it's not *just* about Bitcoin the money.  Money is a human construct for better enabling the exchange of value.  Bitcoin's immutible ledger has immense value, both in terms of money, but also in terms of other value.
For example, you may not see it as a problem that buying a cup of coffee is infeasible with Bitcoin, but in some poorer nations where people only make a cup of coffee's worth of USD in a day, the "value" of that money is much greater and goes much farther.  So not being able to move their cup of coffee's worth of money is a big problem -- and since such places are often the most dangerous and corrupt, they're also the places where being able to protect and move one's money is most important.  It's not about your coffee, it's about the truly parlous situations of other people where a cup of coffee's worth of money is far more meaningful to them.  In order to help such people -- the very people Bitcoin *should* be helping -- it needs to be cost effective enough for them to use.  Taking my extreme example from my previous post, if fees were $300 and nobody could use Bitcoin, it wouldn't matter how secure and decentralized it is, because few people would be able to use it.  Decentralization and security are means to an end -- to ensure that a ledger is accurate and be trusted, even in an insecure and untrustworthy environment.  But if people can't access that ledger to write to it, then it doesn't really matter how secure it is, because they can't use it.  Sure, if raising the block size would harm decentralization enough that it could no longer be censorship-proof against the most powerful adversaries, I'd be against it.  But we know that the network can handle right now this moment 3 or 4 mb blocks without any significant impact on decentralization.
Second, there are plenty of non-financial uses for a ledger such as Bitcoin's.  The only reason Bitcoin's ledger uses money at all is because the block reward tokens must be worth something in order to incentivize miners to keep mining.  But the ledger itself doesn't actually care what the tokens are or what they represent.  Time-stamping and proving ownership or authorship of some intellectual property have a huge array of uses in a variety of situations, all of which can be extremely important and beneficial.  From issuing assets via colored coins, to an exchange proving it has the funds it claims to have, to censorship-proof DNS resolution, to showing that a document existed before a certain point in time -- there's so many uses for Bitcoin's ledger beyond money.  And since the security of the ledger is related to its popularity and the hashing power behind it, these uses necessarily need the One True Ledger for those purposes.  Such use cases may not care about more expensive fees, unlike the 3rd-world citizens in my previous example -- but these use cases still require enough block space to actually make such transactions.  Many of them can be abstracted to higher level layers, not just with segwit, but like how Factom has a merkle root it uses.  But it is still true that they will require *some* space in blocks, and 1mb just isn't enough for all of that.
So why do I think Mike Hearn quit and called Bitcoin a failure?  And why do I think you're wrong about him.  Because so many important use cases for Bitcoin -- things that are possible, don't hurt decentralization, and are deperately needed in order to help people -- so many of these things are being made impossible with the artificial capping of the blocksize and the associated rising fees.  The system is stalling, and *it doesn't need to be*.  Bitcoin is actively being prevented from helping a lot of the very people it was meant to help.  And it's hard to see a path to overcoming that when so many people in the community are fighting to keep it stalled.  Hearn saw the writing on the wall.
If I thought enabling such things would harm decentralization, I would be right there with you.  Preserving decentralization is important, because protecting the ledger is important.  But there's so many changes that we could implement right now that would not significantly impact decentralization.
It's also rather frustrating when people start claiming that the block size is one of the fundamental scarcity aspects of Bitcoin.  That's not true and it was never true.  It was capped as a spam prevention measure, and until recently was never an issue.  Many devs, including Satoshi, openly talked and when it would become appropriate to raise it, and it was always assumed that it would be raised eventually to suit the needs of the system.  This notion that it's **supposed** to be one of the scarcity aspects of Bitcoin is flagrantly made up and is flat out false.  It is only recently that some people have decided it should be.  That was NOT the case up until 2015.

No no no, don't you get it.  You're not using Bitcoin in a valid manner.  All the things people can do with Bitcoin that need small fees -- micropayments, timestamping and other proofs, small trades, gambling, trying to beat credit card fees, trying to do risk assessment on zero conf transactions.... these are all not valid use cases.  The fact that people do them doesn't matter.  Bitcoin wasn't made for people to use the way they want, it was made so that you could only do approved transactions with valid use cases, as determined by some authority figure.  Bitcoin was not created to be a peer-to-peer cash system.  It was made to be a bottom layer clearing-house system for the wealthy.  To make transactions between banking institutions more reliable, for example.  You're just mistaken about what Bitcoin's purpose is.  You thought it was supposed to free people and allow the world to transaction on an individual and censorship-free basis.  Obviously you're an idiot.

That's circular reasoning: You validate the utxo set because it's in the reference block, which you validate by verifying that the utxo set it wants to include is accurate.  And so forth.
Yes, nodes who are around BEFORE the reference block can validate its utxo set, but any nodes that don't come online until after, or which have a gap in their history because they were offline briefly, cannot validate the utxo set without requesting that missing history from others.  This is the same problem that exists, no matter how far back you go.  At some point, unless your node was online at all times since the beginning, you lose the ability to verify the past.


Yeah but the spendable outputs are only spendable because they are outputs of transactions of spent coins.


Yes, that's true.  The theoretical attack is a very long and large 51% attack.  The problem and main issue I have here is that Bitcoin can technically recover from such an attack, because it follows the longest valid chain.  If your history gets rewritten to before the reference block, you simply lose everything.  Either you are no longer on the longest proof of work chain, or you're on a long chain you can't validate.


It's more a theoretical attack.  I don't expect it to actually happen.  It's just that it's technically possible.  We're talking about long long re-writes of history from 51% attacks that span thousands of blocks to before your reference block.  It's not a likely scenario, and I'd actually like to see your idea in an alt-coin.... but for Bitcoin security, remote theoretical attacks are still a concern to me.

As you found out OP, the issues were with your settings for both the Pi and Bitcoin.  For the Pi, don't use any swap.  The SD card is MUUUCCHH slower than normal ram, so if you're using swap and thus have memory operations going through the SD, you're gonna have a bad time.  And for Bitcoin, up your dbcache as high as you can.  On a 2gb memory Pi, I'd try going like 1300 or something.
You need to optimize your Pi's settings and have as little read/write with the sdcard going on as possible.  So, use a minimal system with as few processes running as possible, and make sure you've tuned anything that needs tuning.  Then you can fully utilize the actual CPU and ram of the thing without being bogged down unnecessarily.  THEN you can sync Bitcoin in a reasonably fast time frame.

No, trustlessness, security, censorship resistance and freedom to transact are the goals of the network. Decentralization is only the means to those ends.  But if the network is so expensive to use that people are cut out from using it, they no longer gain those end benefits because they can't afford to use it.
So decentralization must be protected to the point where it ensures those end means. If further decentralization beyond that starts to inhibit those end means, then it must be throttled.

Miners already fight.  They are in a constant state of fighting.  And everything works out fine.  We get multiple orphans/forks per week *currently* and it's fine.
And nodes have always been "bystanders" by your definition.  The situation you are describing, once again, is already happening currently.  The worry is that bigger blocks will cause more of them to stop running nodes, and also that it will take a few more confirmations to arrive on one chain.
There is no additional trust put into miners.  You can still verify everything that is being done, just as always.  You simply have more flexibility in deciding if you think what they are doing is valid.  So, in a sense, it's less trust.

Actually, come to think of it, it's even worse than my other post said.

And yet, he's still completely wrong.  There is and has always been a fee market without any notion of a blocksize cap.  It costs money to mine, and if it's not worth while miners will either turn off their equipment and/or not mine free transaction.  The fee market is merely an equilibrium of tx fees *and* deciding whether or not to shut off equipment.  The fee component of that is still a market, it just takes into consideration another factor.
This notion that so many devs have that there is no fee market without a blocksize cap is simply flat out wrong.  We have years of history of bitcoin transactions from before the 1MB limit was getting close, and that history clearly shows a fee market already did exist.  The argument that too many people will shut off their nodes because it cost too much and will centralize Bitcoin too much is also countered by the real world data.  The marginal cost of additional space is part of that equilibrium, but the notion that such a market will cause *so many* miners to quit that Bitcoin becomes endangered has no basis in reality.  In addition to a history of fees, we also have a detailed history of the difficulty increase.  The facts about how much mining power is added versus fees, with and without the cap nearing, are available for all to see.
The fee market argument being made is simply in error, and it's a shame so many people involved in the technical aspects of Bitcoin don't get it.  A fee market exists no matter what the cap.  The number of nodes will not get "centralizingly low" due to too high of a block size.  Those facts are supported by real world data.
What *will* kill Bitcoin is if it's too expensive to use, and so nobody uses it, and the value proposition of being a popular and useful means of value transfer goes away.

Why does nobody seem to understand that?  Keeping it as it is is just as contentious as changing it.  There are far more people who were lead to believe that from the beginning that it would be scaled, hard forked if necessary, than people who felt that the current max block size would persist forever.  Further, the centralization argument about hard forking *never* came up until recently, and there's absolutely no reason to think it's true.  There are plenty of people, like myself for example, who will keep running nodes, and mining, at a loss, to help support the system.  It's a classic case of "on paper it looks good, but it fails in reality" to say that a slightly higher cost will significantly hurt the node count.  That same argument can be said to say people will never ever seed torrents... and yet they do...  People are not rational actors and real world data and how people *actually* react is important when making economic conclusions.

@_date: 2016-02-18 14:49:32
No, my statement is completely correct.  Your link points out part of what I've already said -- that the difficulty adjustment accounts for validationless mining, and that the transactional capacity is thus the same.
However, you've failed to address the other part of what I said, which is that the lower difficulty makes an attack on the network easier.  Not much easier of course, but easier nonetheless.  And since you freely admit that transactional capacity is the same, there is clearly a net benefit to continuing the mining -- increased network security due to higher difficulty.

Then why do we warn people not to keep money in exchanges and web wallets?
@_date: 2016-02-03 15:23:57
Yeah, the last piece of the puzzle is just that no matter how many inputs you have, you can create (within limits) any number of outputs.  So you can pay multiple people.  So when I said above you reference the previous transaction, you're actually referencing the previous transaction and then the output in that transaction that pays you.  Each *output* from a transaction is used as an *input* in another transaction.  I didn't mention that above, to try to keep it simple, but now that you get it, I just want to make sure you have the correct picture.  When you have money sitting in your address, what you really have is a collection of outputs which have not yet been used as inputs.  Then your wallet software just adds the total of those outputs and tells you you have X amount of bitcoins total, and then when you send money, behind the scenes your wallet software constructs the transaction and picks which outputs to use, and it just displays the aggregate totals to you the user, to make things nice and pretty.

I am in complete agreement with you there, but I have found no convincing evidence or argument to suggest that a hard fork block size increase would be even remotely dangerous.
By far the only half way decent argument is that is shows Bitcoin's "set in stone" rules can be veto'd by a super majority, which was not supposed to be possible and was part of what Bitcoin is supposed to protect against.  However, I feel, as do many others, [including Satoshi]( that Bitcoin was always supposed to increase its block size and that the current anti-spam measure of 1MB blocks was not set-in-stone and was always meant to be changed.

1.  Right you are!  My mistake, it was in another google link that I did not provide to you.  I apologize.
2.  Correct!  Two in a row!
3.  Partial credit.  It's only subjective until you more clearly define the parameters of the query.  In our case, the point of contention is pretty well defined.  I am claiming multiple people hit the upvote button.  You are claiming multiple people wrote programs and registered multiple accounts in order to hit the same upvote button multiple times.  Although we need to better define the ratio of difficulty between our two groups, as well as view a control group of regular reddits not frequently manipulated, in order to figure out what constitutes "a lot" of manipulation... even given those studies lacking, you still have provided little reason in the way of explanation for why you believe what you say is happening *at all* to begin with.  You need to address that before we can even look to the numbers as deciding factors.
4.  Actually that's almost exactly Occam's Razor.  Just stated another way.  "The simplest explanation is usually the correct one" is the most common layman's way to cite Occam's Razor.  However, if it is true, then it must be the case that the non-simplest explanations are usually not the correct one, which directly implies that in order to show them to be correct, a more rigorous standard of evidence must be applied to them.

There are actually two kinds of RBF that this code allows.  The one you are worried about, and also another one which only "activates" if the outputs are the same.  You can have an RBF transaction that is only RBF if the outputs are the same.  It's called a "first seen safe" RBF, and you indicate it by having a sequence number of 4294967294.  A sequence number less than that is the normal RBF that you are worried about.

@_date: 2016-02-03 14:15:26
Bitcoin addresses spend all of their *inputs* (aka transactions where money was sent to them).
Let's say I send you 1 bitcoin and somebody else sends you 2 bitcoins.  You now have 3 bitcoins, from two different transactions.  So if you want to spend say 1.5 bitcoins, you'd use the *input* of that 2 bitcoins that was sent to you, and you have to spend all of it, so you'd send 1.5 to whoever you were paying, and 0.5 back to yourself.  Now you have 1.5 in your address, 1 from the transaction I sent you, and 0.5 from that transaction you just made.
So you always have to spend all of the money from the input you are using, but you don't have to spend all your money if you have money from other inputs.
The way Bitcoin works is that the way you prove you have money is by pointing to a previous transaction and saying "see that transaction was valid and it sent me money, so I'm allowed to spend it", and that transaction said the same thing about the transaction before it.  And it goes on like that all the way back, with each transaction referencing the transaction before it, back all the way to when the coins were "minted" by being in a block reward.  It's a chain of provable digital signatures.  So when you reference a previous transaction, and use it as an input for your transaction, you can't ever reference that same input again, so you have to spend all of it if you want to be able to use that money again.  That's why above, when you have a 2 bitcoin input and wanted to spedn 1.5, you had to spend the whole thing and send yourself back 0.5.  So you now have that new transaction to reference to prove you can spend that 0.5.

For the record, the replace by fee code allows for two different kinds of RBF.  One of which is "first seen safe" which is only valid if all of the outputs for the first transaction are the same.  You can have an RBF transaction which is **only** and first seen safe RBF.
That said, I wish they'd have included some "child pays for parent" prioritizing as well.

And my point is that a small percent of them will hit a winning streak and never dip into the negative during whatever period of time you are talking about.  So the variance of the large group versus the variance of the big player are the same (assuming the big player bets the same size as the individuals in the group).
That's all I'm saying.  You're talking about variance, and I'm pointing out that for the house, it's all the same.  You seem to be implying that the house will win in the end because the gamblers will keep gambling.  I'm telling you that's not true because a small fraction of them will win a lot.  And as far as the house is concerned, that's the same difference as with the big player.
Let's take a contrived example where 99% of the time, you win 10 units, and 1% of the time, you lose 1 unit.  That's a great bet.  If 1000 people play that, starting with only a 1 unit bankroll, a lot of them *will* ***never*** *bust*, no matter how long of a time frame you set.
It's the same in the 50-50 scenario.  (Or at least, the principle is the same.  Obviously a coin flip is much different than the scenario I presented.)  Most people will eventually go broke during your time frame, but some won't.  There's a chance they all will, but there's a chance some of them will just go on a winning streak.  The fact that they're addicted gamblers doesn't change that.  Nothing about them and their personalities matters.  There is no "knowing when to stop".  There's no edge, it's break even.  The house will ***not*** inevitably get the money in the end.
@_date: 2016-02-20 14:51:28


They're still invalid blocks.  The node will not accept them.  Even if the attacker controls all the connections, the node will simply be stalled.


That's a reasonable point, but I'd argue that *not mining* while you validate the prior block makes such attacks way easier.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying I think validationless mining is good, I just think it's *better* than *not* mining while you validate the previous block.
@_date: 2016-02-13 07:34:20
There's nothing to say.  I am correct.  You cannot tell me how to program my node, and I cannot tell you how to program your node.  That is the whole point of Bitcoin.  Your node distrusts every node connecting to it, and only trusts its preprogrammed rules and the uncounterfeitability of proof of work.  If you want to change the code on your node, you are free to do so.  There is no ethereal general concept of consensus.  Consensus is reached when you and I program our nodes with interoperable rules.

With non-hardened keys, you can prove a child is linked to a parent using just the public keys. And as others have said, you can derive public child keys from a public parent key, which enables watch only wallets and other things.
There's some reasons you might want to do those things, but if you're just using BIP32 for easy backup, you should be using hardened keys, if the option is available.

That's true.  I've just seen posts of people who backed up their wallet right at the beginning, then used Qt/Core for a while, and then their computer crashed, and they ended up very sad.

@_date: 2016-02-12 00:52:10
It's no more the consensus chain that a 2MB+ blockchain is the consensus chain, or than litecoin or namecoin is the consensus chain.  The "real" consensus chain is whatever you have programmed your node to accept as valid.  You can program your node to invalidate blocks larger than 1MB, and you will stay on the chain with nodes who do the same.  I will program my node to accept different rules and stay on the chain according to them.  Your consensus chain is not my consensus chain.  There is no one consensus chain.  You control your node, and I control mine.

Sorry, I wrongly assumed most people would be able to do rudimentary searches themselves.  My bad.  Here you go.
Now you go paste those graphs over each other and do some math.


Except that in Bitcoin's case, that statement is completely true.  Imagine a restaurant with 3 tables.  It serves great food, so lots of people try to go there.  Rather than adding more tables, they increase the price, until there's always a reasonably short line, and you can get in if you're willing to spend $8000 per meal.
Nobody goes there any more because it's too *expensive*, because rather than accomidating the crowd, they raised the cost.  Now, sure it tastes great for the 3 people who eat there, but for the rest of the world, they don't go to the restaurant any more.  It may as well not exist for them because they've been priced out of it.
For something that is tauted as the money of the internet, open and available to all, that's a pretty shitty outcome.  Yeah, nobody goes there any more because it's too crowded.... and it got too crowded because it's too small.

That is finally an argument in your favor!  Kudos!
Now we just need actual data to suggest how much of it is going on, since you claim there is much of it.


That would be under "Occam's Razor".
If I hear a knock at my door, it could be a human or it could be an alien.  Those are both possibilities... but one is more far-fetched than the other.  If I tell you I believe the knock at my door came from an alien, I would need to provide some reason for that, because it is so much more far-fetched than any number of other possibilities, like  a human having knocked.
There are infinitely imaginable far-fetched scenarios that one can concoct to explain all situations, but without any reason to back such theories up, the most rational explanation that one should default to is the simplest explanation which adequately explains all the facts.
When you claim that the simplest explanation is *not* the real explanation, the burden is on you to provide some reason for that claim.

You are in error about the burden of proof here.  My claim requires less deviation from normalcy.

Exactly, fees are far more correlated with the price than the block size.


The difficulty is directly derived from the amount of mining power.  If you don't think that's relevant to the argument of whether miners will keep buying and using their mining equipment, then you've simply lost your cognitive faculties.


A *new* fee market, separate from the *current* fee market already in place.


That's because your priorities are different from mine.  Some people also have no problem setting fire to places or kicking kittens, but they have different priorities from me too.
But this isn't about priorities, it's about the logical merit behind the arguments for and raising the block size.


Yeah, it was an analogy meant to represent an underlying idea in simpler terms.  But if you didn't get *that*, then the topic might just be too difficult.


Sure, why don't we just make all transactions have scripts just be OP_TRUE with a merkle root of 500gb of data stored somewhere else.  Then all the old nodes will think they're validating when in reality they won't be, but the "node count" won't go down at least!!  It's still secure even if there's only one updated node actually validating because it's a soft fork, right?

Imagine your million players betting $100 one time each.  The net result is the same as if 1 person with $100 million bankroll had simply sat down and bet $100 a million times in a row.  (On an independent event yada yada yada.)
What your example is failing to take into account is that some people running out of money and stopping is offset by some people winning and playing longer.  In the end, it's the same difference.  The likelihood of every single $100 player going bust is similar to the likelihood of the individual wealthy player busting.

You can right click on the other addresses and hit "freeze" and it will not use them.  However, after you use your chosen address, it will create more.  It will also be default send change to another "change" address in your wallet, so you'd have to manually add that same address as a second output and manually send the change back to your chosen address.
Electrum, and most Bitcoin wallets, are designed to use a different address all the time.  You can still receive money at a previously used address without problem though.  And all the addresses generated will be able to be regenerated with the seed words, so you won't lose any money or anything.
There's really no reason to use just one address.  It is possible, yes, but it's kind of difficult and annoying to do.... and there's no good reason to do it.
Also, since you brought up fees in other replies... Which addresses you use don't matter at all as far as fees go.

Well my argument is that this is how the system is designed. This is what the incentives incentivize. That doesn't make it not a shitty thing for them to do, but bitching and moaning about it is the wrong response. Fork off so they can't do it, or quit bitching.
Isn't this the libertarian dream? No regulation and everybody is acting in their own self interest? Well, guess what, this kind of shit comes with the territory.
This is a voluntary ecosystem. Nobody is forcing you to be here, and you knew what you were getting into. Crying foul and talking about legal action has no place in this space.
This is what you signed up for. So bend over and take it, or fork. Those are the two options.
Bitching and moaning might work in a world of governments and regulation, but in the free market, only actions speak. Jihan did exactly what the system incentivized him to do.
This might not be an argument in favor of Jihan, but I'm still pretty surprised at how many people in this sub of all places think that other people should putting strangers' interests above their own. That's just not how this works. And you're going to keep getting into new worlds of hurt if you think it is. This is the unregulated wild west, and it's up to you to look out for you. Because nobody else will.  That's not nice or fair, but it is how this space works, and it's what you signed up for when you joined.
So that's my two cents anyway.

You should not be using Core if you don't want to be running a full node.  You should be using a lite client like Electrum.
For now, go to the help menu, select the debug console, then in the new window, select the second tab, and get the private key for your address by typing:
    dumpprivkey 1YourBitcoinAddress
You can then import or sweep that into Electrum or any other wallet, and be able to spend it right away.
Or you can wait a few more days/weeks for Core to catch up, and then use it.  It's a fairly nice wallet once you've got the blockchain downloaded and you're ready to go.

Actually it's not.  It adds economic incentive towards ever higher difficulty, which again, increases network security.

The fact that you don't understand those things is why you and I are having troubles.

We have run into a brick wall because you do not understand why the burden of proof is on you or what Occam's Razor is.  Yet you are quite sure that you have made no errors in logic.
This is a brick wall I encounter often, and one over which I have yet to pass.  I simply have found no way of persuading somebody who does not understand things to begin with.

No, it's not.  There's no harm in doing it.  They are validating the previous block which they do it.  It's either this or not mine.  Either way, no transactions get in a block during that period, but without continuing to mine, the difficulty slightly less and an attack is slightly easier.
There is no loss happening by them mining at that time.  An equilibrium is reached, yes, but it's not one which harms the system in aggregate.

This is normal.  You only have to do it once.  If this is problematic for you, you shouldn't be running a node and should instead use a light client like Electrum.
Also, it will probably take closer to a week than two days.  The first 300k blocks go pretty fast because there weren't many transactions.  The last hundred k take forever.
As somebody else mentioned, increasing the dbcache in your config file will help dramatically.  Put it as high as you can stand.  On my box I rent, with 16 gigs of ram, I set dbcache to 8000 and synced in about 7 hours.  On my old desktop that I'm now using as a home server, it took two weeks to sync.

Your claim is more far-fetched because it requires more effort to manipulate voting than it does to use the system normally, and because vote manipulation is less common than normal voting -- that is, most people, most of the time, do not engage in it.  Even for highly up- or down-voted posts, normal voting is far more commonly the reason for the score.  So when you claim manipulation is happening, you are claiming the rarer occurrence.

Bitcoin Core (what you're running) is not just a Bitcoin wallet.  It is what is called a "full node".  That means, if you connect it to the internet, it will try to download the entire (~65gb) blockchain, verify it as valid, and continue validating new blocks and incoming transactions, and relaying them to other people as well.
Bitcoin Core is one of a handful of implementations of the Bitcoin protocol that performs every function necessary to keep the Bitcoin network up and running.
Most Bitcoin software does *not* perform every function.  Electrum for example, connects to a central server and asks for only a small amount of information -- it does not download the whole blockchain, nor does it connect to other people and relay any information.  So it's not participating in keeping the Bitcoin network alive and well.  But that's ok -- not everybody has to be a full node.  It's sort of like torrenting.  There's plenty of people who just leech and don't contribute, but as long as there's enough seeders, everything works just fine.  If you want to seed (run a full node), that's great, but you don't have to.
However, what Electrum is really good at is being a wallet.  Bitcoin Core does have wallet functionality, but it's kind of clunky and not really intuitive for the user.  (Your original post highlights the difficulty in just viewing your public payment address.)
Electrum is really easy and intuitive for the user, and on top of that, the payment addresses you get are derived deterministically.  So if you backup those words it shows you at the beginning, or backup your wallet file, you'll always be able to recover all your money from any of your addresses.  Bitcoin Core on the other hand generates new addresses at random when you want a new public address, so even if you've backed up your wallet file, your backup may not contain newer addresses, so if your computer crashes, you're just screwed.
So for making an offline wallet, Electrum is clearly the superior choice.  You don't need any of the full node functionality, and all of the features of Electrum's wallet functionality -- the more intuitive interface, and the ability to save those words and recover all your money no matter how many addresses you use -- because of those features, Electrum is clearly the better choice for your purpose.

Bolding and quoting things doesn't actually make your argument any better, just so you know.


You can't predict the entire future perfectly, but you absolutely can predict specific things to certain probabilities.  If I am coming up to a stop light and it is red, I can say with a high degree of confidence that the car in front of me will stop at the light and not run through it.  I use past evidence and come up with some probability, say 98% or whatever, and have a statistical variance, and so forth.  He may stop at the light or he may not, I don't know for sure.  But that doesn't mean I can't use logic and past data and make very good and accurate estimates of what the future holds, within that specific context.


Actually you can.  Not only can you make educated guesses about the future and plan for them, which tech companies do *all the time*, you can also (or instead) implement a solution that will handle things regardless.  For example, the proposal where miners vote on the block size, so it can scale -- or not -- when necessary.  (I disagree with that proposal for a variety of reasons, but it makes the point well.)


Yes, many things people predicted did not come true.... and many of them did.
If you genuinely believe the future cannot be predicted, how about we make a wager?  I predict that 10 years from today, the U.S. Census Bureau will, the next time it measures such things, find that over 60% of U.S. households have access to gigabit (or faster) internet.
That's a very specific claim, and if you truly believe I cannot predict the future at all to any degree, you should jump on that bet since anything can happen.  Who knows, maybe WW3 breaks out and the US is nuked and I lose the bet that way!  It's impossible to know!  The future is a complete mystery and we can say nothing of any value about it!


I understand your fear.  It's a scary world when you don't know how anything works and everything around you seems mysterious and unknowable.  But I promise you, if you learn how statistics work, and if you learn how technology works, you will be far less afraid and far more confident in your ability to "predict" the future.  (To varying degrees of accuracy...)

The only thing you listed that I believe to be a legitimate worry is SPV nodes who get their information only from miners.  And I would claim that since 1 and 2 block re-orgs are a regular occurrence anyway, that SPV nodes should always wait a bit for verification.
Still, that is an example where validationless mining is strictly worse, so it satisfies my request.
As for the other points, I'm not even sure how they work.
Point 1 just isn't how the network works to begin with.  The attacker sends the block header which must be valid.  That *is* always validated, because the block hash has to compute as valid and also be included in the next block.  The validation that's not going on is checking every transaction and making sure the merkle tree of transactions is correct and valid.  But the block header is always verified no matter what.  "Not sending one byte" is not a thing.  I don't even understand what you mean by it, and without trying to be rude, it makes me question your knowledge of how mining works.  The attacker either sends the block header or he doesn't.
Point 2 is the same as if miners stopped mining.  The attacker is the only one doing any work, and thus if he finds a block, he will get it out without being orphaned.  However, he's either working on an invalid chain, or he's already spent a lot of energy computing an invalid block that he could have been using to try to find a valid block, so if he's trying to use the attack to get the valid block first, he should have just been mining valid blocks in the first place and trying to win the race.  Even with a non-zero orphan rate, it is still strictly better for him to use his hashing power to find a valid block to begin with.
Point 3 -- See my complaint about point 1.  That's not how this works.  That's not how any of this works!  What are you talking about!?


But it cost him also wasting his own time to do it, and the only benefit is that possibly a handful of SPV nodes will get a few confirmations un-done, which as I mentioned happens with some regularity anyway already.


That already happens when blocks are found at about the same time.  The network splits, working on different chains, and eventually one [valid] chain becomes longer and everybody moves back over to that.
The SPV thing I'll grant you -- that's a completely legitimate complaint.  The as far as I can see, the other things either are -- well, for the most part, the other stuff you said frankly didn't make any sense to me.
When you hash something, there is no "withholding" of a byte or any other data.  You either have a complete picture or you don't.  It's a binary yes/no thing.  And even with validationless mining, the attacker must still send a complete valid-looking block header and a transaction list.  An attacker can't "withhold" anything from the network.  That's not how it works.

I genuinely don't believe that they really want a hard fork blocksize increase at any point in the future.  Many of them have spoken about how they think the blocksize limit is part of Bitcoin's scarcity value, and others (most notably Luke jr, but also others) have spoken about their concerns about the technological restrictions and that any increase is too centralizing for the foreseeable future.  I genuinely don't believe that a block size hard fork is in the cards in the future on Core's roadmap, even though they claim it is.  If they put out a hard fork 2mb blocksize / 8mb block weight segwit any time in the next year, I will admit I was wrong and happily jump from the BU ship.
I support BU because I think an increase is necessary, and I don't believe it will cause the problems or centralizing pressures that Core worries it will.  (Although obviously I'm concerned about the actual code problems that have been popping up.  But assume I'm talking about good solid code for a hard fork increase.)
Additionally, BU means that we can soft fork down to lower caps, and in the future any increase is a soft fork rather than another hard fork.  So I think that aspect makes it cleaner, and since I haven't found compelling reasons to worry about the downsides, on the whole I think it's a good proposal.  But I'd be happy to switch to other proposals.... if I thought they were actually in the cards.  2/4/8, BIP 101, 2mb kick the can... something, just give me something!
What I'm really looking for is some acknowledgement that Core actually will do an increase in the future.  And because I don't believe their words, that acknowledgement needs to be in the form of action.  So far the actions have spoken very loudly, and they have said nothing but "fuck you, no increase".
That's in fact the only reason I don't support segwit.  Segwit is fine code and I'm fine with it, but I genuinely believe that if it gets pushed through without any guarantee of a future blocksize increase that that will be the final nail in the coffin for any future blocksize increase.
By all means, convince me I'm wrong!  I'd love to be.  I have researched this carefully, thought about it a lot, and unlike so many people around here often assume, I actually do know how Bitcoin works and how segwit works.

That's not how the rules of logic work.  The more far-fetched a claim is, the more evidence is required to back it up.  My claim is that the fact that hard fork related posts are upvoted is because they are popular.  Your claim is that they are upvoted because a minority of people are performing a constant vote-rigging campaign.  Your claim is more far-fetched and thus the burden of proof is on you.  You can back up your claim, give reason that my claim is more far-fetched than it seems, or do something else to shift the burden of proof back to me.  But as it stands, the ball is in your court.  If you don't understand why that is, then it behooves you to learn the rules of logic before you get into arguments.


A good starting place is to learn the long list of logical fallacies and try to understand them.  However, I would recommend taking the time to learn skeptical thinking generally, as the "logic" behind logic is easier to come to if you already think correctly.  It is the difference between memorizing a set of math equations and learning how to derive them.  It's easier once you know the right process and how to approach it.
If you cannot Google lists of logical fallacies and introduction to skeptical thinking, let me know, and I'll find some good starting resources.
@_date: 2016-02-23 19:31:14
I believe you are misunderstanding how and what block withholding attacks are.  Or at the very least, how they relate to validationless mining.
In the situation you have described, you are withholding the last byte or a valid block until the minority finds another block, so that you can invalidate their block.  That is not to do with validationless mining -- that's just a 51% attack.  You and your majority chain mine in secret and then publish to the rest of the world later and cause a re-org which is in same way beneficial to you (by un-doing a transaction for example).  You can do that same attack with less than 51%, and just most of the time you will fail, but sometimes you won't.  The risk however is far worse with less than 51% (or rather, 50%+1), because you definitely *won't* outpace the others, and when you fail, you not only fail to accomplish your goal of undoing a transaction or whatever, you also fail to get the block reward that you would have gotten by publishing your block sooner.
There are a number of block withholding attacks, and you are right to worry about them, but you have not convinced me at all that they are somehow **harder** if other miners *aren't mining* rather than doing validationless mining.  In fact, in your opening paragraph you even started out by saying your block could be valid.
Which by definition cannot be an argument against validationless mining.  Any argument against it must necessarily have miners being punished for not validating, which can only happen if they are mining on top of an invalid block.
So yes, I agree with you that block withholding is an attack and may occasionally be something to worry about.  But it is not clear to me how that relates to the arguments for and against validationless mining versus not mining until a block is validated.

@_date: 2016-02-20 15:22:19


I'm pretty sure that's not correct.  In every attack vector, validationless mining is at worst equivalent to not mining.  For example, let's say an attacker produces an invalid block.  He then keeps mining for valid blocks while everybody else mines for that invalid block.  Well, he still has to produce a proof of work for the block he's working on now.  The mining doesn't get easier because he's the only one working on it.  And at least with validationless mining, the difficulty is higher.  A 51% attack does not get easier.
What specific attacks can you think of where validationless mining is just strictly worse than not mining while the prior block is validated?

If it confirmed, it's in one of the seeds/wallets.  If it's not there, it's the wrong address.  You're missing something somewhere.  Bitcoins don't just get lost.  They're sitting in an address somewhere.  If it's one of your addresses, Electrum will see it.

@_date: 2016-02-19 01:59:57
It takes a while.  If you had any fee at all above 0.00005 bitcoins, it will likely get confirmed sometime soon.  You don't need to do anything else or wait for the confirmation.  The person you sent it to should already see that you sent it and will monitor it themselves.  If it's a service that requires some number of confirmations, then you just have to wait a bit and check back later.  If you want to make sure your transaction goes in the next block next time, just make the fee 0.0002 bitcoins.
Also, be aware that when the next block happens isn't exactly every ten minutes, it's only *on average* every ten minutes.  Sometimes, hours go by before the next block comes, and so your transaction, even if it had a high fee, would have to wait that long.
@_date: 2016-02-19 01:33:44
Ok, hold on, I need to lay this out simply and clearly to look at it carefully.
Let us take a scenario and play it out logically.  In this scenario, there are two separate "chains", with two separate difficulties.  Each chain has the same amount of hashing power, which has been constant for a while, so the difficulty hasn't moved on either chain for a while, although the difficulty is higher on the former chain than the latter.
The first chain mines for all ten minutes, but if a block happens to be solved in the first minute, it has no transactions in it.  After that minute is up, if it is mined it is a normal block.
The second chain does not mine for one minute -- the entire mining network shuts down for a minute when a block is found, and then mines for 9 minutes and at any point, if a block is found, it has transactions in it.
Again, the difficulty has been adjusted for each chain.  So the former chain finds a block on average every 10 minutes, with 10% of them being empty.  The second chain on average takes 9 minutes to find a block, because the difficulty for that chain assumes it's mining during that first minute when it isn't.
So they both find the same amount of blocks in the same amount of time, and the former chain has 10% empty blocks.  So yes, you are correct that the lower-difficulty chain has a higher transaction capacity.  So I am definitely wrong about that.
What about security implications though?  A 51% attack costs less not only because of the lower difficulty, but also because the attacker can mine during that first minute, and publish an empty block right at second 60, which the second network will accept, thinking he just happening to find it on his first try.  Further, anybody can also mine during that first minute, and if they happen to find a block, publish it at 60 seconds and know that they have stopped the network in its tracks for another minute.  And if we remove the wait to publish restriction, we can see that anybody who mines during that first minute gains the advantage of having the lower difficulty, so they effectively have a 10% increase in hashing power, and zero orphan rate since nobody else is mining.
Yeah, that's definitely an unstable and bad situation as far as I can see.  You are absolutely right that the transactional capacity is lower on the higher difficulty chain, but I think that's a reasonable trade-off for the security benefits of continuing to mine during that first minute.
But yeah, facts are facts, and you are right and I am wrong about the transaction capacity of the two networks.
That said, Yoghurt's argument was about the *transition* period, where the two chains were on the same difficulty.  As if the first chain in my scenario suddenly stopped mining and became the second chain, but with that first chain's difficulty.  In that case, it would take longer than 9 minutes, it would take 10 minutes, and so the average time to find a block would be 11 minutes (1 of waiting, 10 to mine) until the difficulty decrease.  In THAT scenario, which is what Yoghurt was talking about in the link he presented, everything I said holds up.  The increase in capacity for the wait-one-minute network is now offset by the fact that it takes them longer to find a block, since they still at that time have the higher difficulty.  Only once the new difficulty adjustment happens, do they have a higher transaction throughput per unit time.  Your argument is slightly different than his argument.  You are talking about after the difficulty adjustment has happened, and he talking about during the transition period.

Find the data directory.  This is the folder that has within it a folder called "blocks" and another called "chainstate".  In that data folder, make a text file called "bitcoin.conf" NOT "bitcoin.conf.txt".  Open that text file and put at the top
    prune=550
Then run Bitcoin.  It may take it a bit to get pruned, but then you're good to go, and you'll only ever have a few gigs of space taken up by Bitcoin.
BE WARNED!  If something happens where you need to rescan, it won't work.  So you'll need to redownload the entire blockchain without pruning if that happens.  Or you can just make a zip file backup of the pruned data directory at some point and then just restore that if there's a problem.  But that can be dangerous if you don't have a recent backup of your wallet file, since prior to 0.13, new addresses were randomly generated on the fly, so your old backed up wallet might not have more recent addresses.

There's selfish equilibrium incentive for people to not do that, for the very reason you stated, that they will fork off the network.


And they will be forked off the network because nobody can relay their blocks.  You might have all the hashing power in the world, but if you can't relay it faster than the rest of the network mines new blocks, that doesn't matter.  You have an economic incentive to find an equilibrium where your blocks can be effectively relayed.
And when protocols that allow users to reconstruct blocks rather than relay them get implemented, blocksizes can get much bigger without the bandwidth issue.  And sure that will raise hard disk costs, but the only argument against big blocks so far has been relay speeds because everybody already agrees that disk space is cheap.  (I'm preempting the disk space argument.)


Please do post them.  If I see one I haven't already heard and refuted, I'm certainly open to changing my mind.  But most of the arguments I've heard make that claim don't actually hold water when put to scrutiny.


Only in the short term.  The incentives align so that long term everybody converges on the same network.  At worst, bigger blocks will reduce the confidence in a small number of confirmations.

If we can't figure out what happened, yes.
BUT, we probably can.  Bitcoins don't get lost.  They were either sent somewhere or they weren't.  There is no "limbo" for Bitcoins.
So either you sent them to some address you don't own, and they're gone, or otherwise they're in one of your wallets.  So if you have the right seeds for all of your wallets, they're there somewhere, we just need to find them.
Start over.  Walk me through exactly what you did, step by step, on each of your devices, and what the "seed" on each device is -- using code names of course, like "this address came from Seed1, which is my phone's wallet seed".
Let's see if we can figure out where the issue occurred.

It's confirmed now.  Contact Bitpay with the tx ID or payment URL, and ask them to either ship the money back or to tell Steam the payment went through.  If they go the "tell Steam" route, you now need to contact Steam and let them know the payment should show up now.  Next time, you'll need to pay a higher fee until either LN is up or the blocksize is raised.  Blocks are at capacity, and demand is not slowing, so fees are rising to historic levels.

Being "on the blockchain" means that it's confirmed.  However, when somebody sends a transaction, Bitcoin software sends it around the network, and your software holds both the blockchain AND all the unconfirmed transactions that it's received.  So you should see the transaction right away, or within a few seconds, while it's unconfirmed and waiting to get in the blockchain (aka get confirmed).

Alright, you know what, I'll break my commitment to not replying to you any time you give concrete quantifiable claims rather than blathering nonsense and links to things that you know nothing about.  You have just implicitly claimed that you can find at least some information about an input fed into a whirlpool hash.  I will reply to you again only if and when you can give me some information about the input.
Here are the steps I took to create the hash:
    $ pip install Whirlpool
    $ python
    &gt;&gt;&gt; import whirlpool
    &gt;&gt;&gt; with open("/dev/random", 'rb') as f:
    ...   x = f.read(128)
    ... 
    &gt;&gt;&gt; whirlpool.new(x).hexdigest()
    '391f2ecc7705d5d3654a6b3207038e6155470337af16f46178a878551e2e76f9fc03598d6e22d849cf3541530d8be295d1680ebb09fa20634e791208b3f75b92'
After that, I wrote x to a file and saved it, and then opened a new python instance to read the file and confirmed I can re-create the hash.  So that I don't have to keep it around, I have encrypted it to myself below, so if/when you feel you can provide the input or any information about the input, I can decrypt the PGP message below and check it.  (I have also verified that I can decrypt the PGP message and re-create the hash from that.)
Heck, if you can crack the pgp message and get the answer, you can do it that way to.  If you can provide any information about the input to statistical degree of better than 4 standard deviations from random guessing, I will take back everything I have said about you and declare you the fucking master of the universe.
Until that time, I will not be responding to you or your nonsense, unless you give other concrete claims that can be verified.
Good luck.

Yes you're correct.  The reason you use a public key is so that the funds can only be unlocked by a digital signature which can be compared against a public key.  If there was no public key, there'd be nothing to verify, and anybody could spend anybody else's money.
(And in fact, you can create addresses that don't have a public key.  For example, there is a [P2SH address]( whose redeem script is just "OP_TRUE", so anybody can spend its money.)

No, it's what people are used to.  People who keep their coins on Coinbase have only ever known traditional banking.  Coinbase serves as an intermediary to get them onboarded onto Bitcoin, both by providing a bank model they are familiar with and by facilitating trade between fiat and Bitcoin.
It would be crazy for *you* to use Coinbase to store your coins, because of what you know and what your values are.  It may not be crazy for other people, people who may not know much about how Bitcoin works, or people who may not be confident enough in their ability to secure their coins such that the risk of theft by Coinbase is less risky to them than the risk posed by them holding their own coins.

Use and HD wallet like Electrum.  Generate a long random password -- GENERATE, not make yourself, but generate using a computer's random function -- something like a 30 or 40 or more characters long password of random characters.  Encrypt your HD wallet seed with that randomly-generated password.  Give the encrypted seed to your beneficiaries, and put the password in your will or with your lawyer.  Make sure to instruct the beneficiaries that they should never give the encrypted seed to anybody, they are only to *receive* the password from your lawyer or executor.  (And make sure they understand how to decrypt the seed and how to use Bitcoin and so forth.)
Edit:  You can also split the encrypted seed and/or password up into shares, so that they function like a multisig key.  So for example, you could make it so 2-of-4 beneficiaries are required to reveal the encrypted seed, or something like that.  Or all beneficiaries plus lawyer to reveal password.  Or any subset you can imagine.
Edit 2:  You can also use relative lock time and a custom P2SH script so that either your private key is required to spend, or a beneficiary's key plus 6 months must have elapsed since you used the address.  But that requires special knowledge on your part to implement it since that's not available in any wallet software.

No, you can't get the private key from just the public key and the BIP38 password. In fact, the two have nothing to do with each other. It is just as difficult to get the private key as it would be with only the public key and no BIP38 password.
You need the BIP38 password and the BIP38 encrypted key beginning with 6P.

You'd use your local cryptocurrency while on Mars, and then trade it for an Earth-Mars cryptocurrency with a block time of at least a few weeks whenever you want to ship money over to Earth.  There'd likely be intermediate third parties, or futures markets, to facilitate trade on zero conf Earth-Mars transactions, so the other party could get paid immediately in their own Earth-based currency.  (Or the Earth and Mars currencies could be side chains of the Earth-Mars currency.)
Suffice to say, unless you develop faster than light technology, it's probably not possible -- or at least it's very difficult -- to share the same currency between distances that far apart.  You'd have to have separate currency in each place, and then a go-between mechanism (such as the super-long-block-time Earth-Mars currency).

They didn't copy his digital signature.  They copied his physical signature.  He provided the version 7 document which contained his own digital signature and also a seperate e-mail from OkCoin (which included the v7 contract as an attachment) that was PGP-signed by OkCoin.  The v8 contract copied and pasted their physical signatures, but had no digital signatures whatsoever.  The physical signatures were also pixel for pixel identical to the v7 contract -- they were *obviously* forged copies.
There was only one valid contract, which was signed physically and digitally by both parties.  And then there was a forgery dated later with no digital signatures and obvious direct copy/pastes of the physical signatures.
I'm not Ver's biggest fan, but he's clearly 100% in the right as far as the legit contract goes.

Well, if those weren't the questions you were referring to in your previous reply, then what exactly *were* the questions you were referring to?  Those were the only questions I asked.
As for them being "hypothetical" (rhetorical is the word you're looking for), yes for most users those questions are hypothetical.  Because most users care about the USD value of their coins and don't give a shit about the scaling debate.  But you, your priorities are different.  You don't give a shit about "non-Bitcoin" chains.  So while yes I can understand why most users would care, I don't see any basis for why *you* care what happens on a non-Bitcoin chain.


No, I'm saying that if you don't consider Bitcoin Cash to be a safe chain that you would ever use, then I don't understand why you **care** if an address on it that is the same as your Bitcoin address sends or receives funds.  It's not a chain you'll ever use or care about, so what does it matter to you what transactions happen on it?


I would love it if Core would implement replay protection for their irresponsible hold-out chain.  But alas, this is a voluntary space, and nobody gets to tell anybody else what to do.

That is another factually incorrect statement.  They might not implement procedures you personally think they should, but they absolutely do implement procedures which have thus far prevented users losing funds.  One such procedure is not allowing trades for more than they can cover in the event of a loss.  That's not a cryptographic protection, but it is still sufficient.

I understand your point and agree with you.  That's also why I got into Bitcoin and why I always control my keys.  But that's not necessarily why other people get into Bitcoin.  Some people may just think of it as an investment and be happy to use banks.  Some people may want to exit banking system, but not trust their own security abilities and think of a "bitcoin bank" as at least better than a normal bank.  It depends on the person, their goals and reasons for using Bitcoin, and their judgement of their own ability to secure their keys.
And my point was that -- as you rightly say -- trust isn't binary.  Some people may trust Coinbase enough to store their Bitcoins there, because that fits within their goals and reasons for using Bitcoin.  That's OK.  It introduces them to Bitcoin, and as they get better with security, maybe they'll decide to move their coins to keys in their control.  Coinbase is a stepping stone.
My original comment to you was trying to show the concept that trust isn't binary, and that the threshold of "keeping coins in your own keys" is simply one point along the trust spectrum.  It may be an important line to cross for you, and for me, but "trust" is still a spectrum.
I'm not sure if I'm making any more sense, so I guess I'll stop typing...
@_date: 2017-09-19 09:35:34
The economic theory behind all this postulates that it won't be a problem.  As coins are lost and moved out of circulation, all the other coins become worth more, so the net "value" in the world isn't reduced by the losing of the coins.  The available coins in circulation just become more valuable.

Actually, we do know.  There's not enough data to get an exact figure, but there's more than enough to say with an *extremely* high degree of confidence that there are more people using lite clients than full nodes for their wallet software.
As somebody else mentioned, things like Trezor which only work with lite clients, have sales records and we can use that to infer some minimum number of users.  And that's just one example.  There's many more similar types of data points we can use to fudge some kind of half way reasonable guesswork.
I appreciate that you appreciate the security a full node provides, but saying we don't know if full nodes are the most used wallet software is like saying we don't know if evolution is real.  We do know.

The whole point of running a node is so you don't have to trust others.  If your node doesn't function properly to avoid malfunction due to transactions on another chain, I suggest modifying your node.  I can point you to the code of a great upgrade coming in November if you'd like.
But frankly, I don't see why you consider that a threat.  Since you don't care about the other chain or consider it valid, what do you care if a transaction you make on your network is broadcast on that chain?  And if you do care, why is it the responsibility of the people on the chain you consider invalid to do anything?  What should they care what you care about?  I was under the impression that this was a free market of voluntary participants.  Yet all I hear around here is "we're being attacked" and "everything is everybody else's fault".

Expertise matters if you are not an expert and thus are incapable of judging something for yourself, and so your best option is trusting experts who know better.

Everybody places their trust in somebody else at some point, because you just don't have the time to do everything yourself.  There are layers and levels of course, and running your own node requires less trust than using an exchange, but don't go pretending Bitcoin is trustless in and of itself.

It *was*, you just didn't realize it.  That's what I was trying to point out.  The increased orphan rate you talk about is already a cost that exists currently, it just manifests itself in another way.


They aren't brought down.  They just continue on a chain without that block.


Yeah, confirmations are *probabilities* of history being altered.  The more confirmations there are, the more "set in stone" a transaction is.  It's not a binary secure/insecure.  It's a ever-decreasing probability of double-spends.  That's what proof of work is all about.


Correct, there will be more orphans and forks, but not enough to make the network fall apart like you are imagining.  Everybody still converges on the main chain eventually.  We're talking waiting 4 blocks instead of 2, not 200 instead of 1.

That entire post ignores the fact that the low bandwidth miner drops out, the difficulty adjusts, and everything goes back to normal.  That's no more centralizing than free electricity or having access to cheaper materials, or any number of other factors.
Miners also have incentive to have enough distributed hashing power that confidence in Bitcoin isn't lost, because otherwise their coins aren't worth anything.

That is not correct.  You simply assumed those rules existed because everybody was using them.  So people using them, like myself, understood that they were not fixed and have been using them for the sake of convention, compatibility, and community cohesion.
I never agreed that those "rules" were set in stone, and have always been of the opinion that they would one day change to fit the needs of the community.  I have been in Bitcoin since early 2011 and until 2015 it was always assumed and understood by the majority of the community that eventually Bitcoin would need on chain capacity increases.  This was not even controversial until recently.
The fact that you personally believe the the current rules to be, and want them to be, set in stone, does not matter to me or concern me.  You are free to run a 1mb chain forever and not come along on a big block fork.  Just as I am free to fork off a 1mb chain and continue on another rule-set.


Exactly!  I'm glad we're in agreement.  You run your software and I'll run mine.  When our rules agree, we we meet on the same chain, and when the disagree, we will be on different chains.
@_date: 2016-10-16 21:01:16


1.  The cost has to be worth the fun.  And it has to be ongoing.  2. Other people have to continue on the chain.  If somebody is making it impossible to mine on a chain, guess what, people will move to another chain and it will get longer.  3. Replay attacks are trivially easy to guard against or fix. You broadcast two conflicting transactions to pay yourself at different addresses and do this over and over until you have different utxos on each chain.


You don't *choose* to orphan them.  They *get* orphaned by the fact that you can't receive their blocks.  So you continue on without them because you never got them in time and got somebody else's smaller block first.


And you'd be wrong.  Math doesn't care what your personal thresholds or definitions are.




I wasn't talking about a black swan event in the text you quoted.  I was talking about the average state of the network.  "Falling apart" is an arbitrary definitions based on just how confident you are in a re-org or double-spend not happening.  You previously defined "set in stone" as 2 confirmations.  You might want to change that if re-orgs are more common.  But it's still a probability threshold.


I have not forgotten, nor am I surprised by that given the depth of your arguments thus far.


Yeah, it's almost like killing zero conf with no benefit is entirely different from waiting 20 more minutes so that the entire world can use Bitcoin safely and cheaply.
@_date: 2016-10-26 04:42:58


And yet somehow Ethereum is still trucking right on along.


Well there's been about a half dozen in Bitcoin's history due to bugs and version compatability issue.  But A two block re-org will happen naturally on average every 20 years.
Again, you can consider that "set in stone" all you want.  But it is merely a mathematical probability with a clearly defined likelihood and a standard deviation.  Your own personal thresholds don't actually change that.


I have understood what you *claim* it will cause.  I have simple disagreed about your claim being warranted.


It absolutely does.  If double-spending is earlier, more people will do it.  Thus the probability of any given transaction being double-spent is increased.  Thus the probability of any given transaction being confirmed within any given window is decreased.
If you are a business performing a risk assessment of zero conf transactions and deciding how much insurance to get or how much risk you will take, those probabilities add up to real quantifiable value.




It's all probabilities.  You don't seem to understand that.  There are only probabilities.  There is no clearly defined wall that makes something "safe" or "unsafe".


It's a small cost in order to allow a gigantic gain.  I view it as a reasonable trade-off.  You have to move your personal threshold from 2-conf being set in stone to 3-conf or 4-conf being set in stone, and for that slight extra inconvenience, the whole world gets to use Bitcoin.


I'm not sure *you* understand Bitcoin's security model.

No I was hoping to point out to you that you may not be seeing things correctly if that's your choice of analogy.
The "rest" is already outlined in my previous post.  You don't get to tell me what software ***I*** consider valid.  I get to choose my own definition of valid, and when you and I agree on what is valid, we will converge on the same chain.  The natural pressure to be on a popular chain that everybody uses, and thus its tokens have value, will naturally force participants to converge on their definitions of validity.
But there is no objectively "valid" ruleset.

This further exemplifies how broken DNS actually is.  The attacker can not only reroute to his own server, with Letsencrypt, he can generate a valid SSL certificate since he controls the domain, which means his fake site will have all the appearance of a legitimate site, little green lock and all.  Centralized DNS is just fundamentally broken.

There is no valid.  All you can control is what software you run.  You do not get to decide what software I run.  Bitcoin was successfully bootstrapped because enough people ran software that agreed on the definition of what they considered valid.  That definition however is not fixed in stone, because it *can't* be in a decentralized system.  I will run my software and you will run yours.  When we agree, we will converge on the same chain.  When we disagree, we will fork away from each other.  The fact that the distributed trust comes from having a strong and secure main chain means that most people will decide to agree on what "valid" is so that they can get the security benefits of having a "one true chain".  But that's an economic incentive, not a set in stone rule.  You do not get to decide what I consider valid.

Whether you're for or against it, segwit is not *on-chain* scaling.  It's "creating extra space" by taking signatures out of blocks and making all segwit transactions spendable by anybody, and hoping that the majority of the network will download and verify and abide by the extraneous non-block signature data.
Now, there's no reason to think that won't work out fine with a high activation threshold -- all other soft forks have worked just fine -- but let's be clear about what it is and is not.  It is **not** on-chain scaling.  It requires *non-blockchain data* in order to verify transactions.
@_date: 2016-10-13 13:22:27
Please read the whole post before replying next time.  After the part you quoted, I then went on to explain how a million other things also lead to that centralization and how block size is not more centralizing than the bevy of other factors like electricity costs and mining equipment costs, since in the end, it all comes down to resource management and paying for a node with better bandwidth is functionally no different than paying for any other cost.
@_date: 2016-10-16 21:07:36
Sigh.  You haven't understood my argument at all.  I'm saying all the things you are worried about currently exist right now already.  And that bigger blocks will not make things worse.  It will only make the differences between miners manifest in different ways.
Right now, a rich miner can buy more hardware and make more money by mining faster than a smaller miner.
In a big block world, the rich miner instead pays for faster internet and makes more money than the small miner by having a lower orphan rate.
The rich miner is better off in both scenarios.  It doesn't matter how the fact that he is rich manifests itself, he comes out ahead either way.
Even if you don't agree with the argument, do you at least understand what I am saying now?
@_date: 2016-10-09 10:46:43
It will never get that high.  Remember, a lot of talk about caps and how much things are worth are taking into account monetary velocity and leverage and all kinds of other factors that artificially inflate the view of the supply.  And with layer 2 solutions like LN, which I don't agree with but which are likely coming, those will greatly inflate the "velocity" of Bitcoin without actually using the coins and without requiring the coins to actually hold that value.  A price point an order of magnitude lower than your estimate would easily accommodate all of the world's transactions.

No, the "mix" won't change.  How the large miner's advantage manifests is what changes.  It still comes down to a difference in money and material resources.
I don't know how many times I can say that.  I don't know how better to explain it.


There is only one peer reviewed look into block size, which concluded that 4MB was fine and larger than that was murky.  That's the only "credible" research done into the topic, and I have a number of issues with the conclusions drawn in that paper.  If you want to pretend like there's all this credible research that has been done, you're welcome to tell yourself that, but it is not the truth.  There has been very limited research done.  What there has been is a whole lot of people making unwarranted conclusions based on little or no data.


There's a difference between fixed costs and marginal costs.  That's what allows people with more resources to get better ROI's, because they are in a position to take advantage of things like volume discounts and other marginal costs.
But that's irrelevant to the discussion anyway.  Even if the ROI was the same, the points both of us are making would be the same and the ROI wouldn't change the conclusions.


As mentioned before, this problem *already exists* and simply manifests in different ways.  That's why it's not **more** centralizing.


It's already going to be sublinear very soon with the numerous improvements you mentioned and many more.  Those optimizations help bigger blocks more than smaller blocks.  If you can reconstruct a block of 10k transactions for only a little bit more than it costs to reconstruct a 1k block, the additional fees make up for the difference.


Well the argument took place in a temporary vacuum of unchanging difficulty in order to prove the point is true.  And if it's true, it remains true at the new difficulty, and thus at all difficulties and the percentages don't matter.  It's an issue of logic, so it really doesn't matter how you represent it.


My argument is that the centralization issues you are worried about already exist and that bigger blocks do not increase them but rather make the current ones manifest in different ways.
If you accept that argument as true, then the conclusion necessarily follows.  That conclusion is that since the difference between big miners and small miners is money/resources, if the above statement is true, then the difference between the big and small miners remains the same -- it is that same difference in resources.  There is no additional disparity, and thus no additional centralization.
It is a fairly straightforward conclusion, which is why I have earlier proclaimed you didn't understand my core argument.
So where exactly are you claiming I have erred in going from the premise to the conclusion?

Well, not really.  There's an important distinction between something like the lightning network and something like Paypal or Visa.  It may be off chain, but it still requires your digital signature.  You're still in control, it's just that you don't announce publicly to the network that you're in control.  Your coins still can't be moved or forged or anything.  And at any point you can publish the current state of your coins to the network and make everything back on chain.
Here's a simple example of a simple payment channel:  I want to watch a movie you have, and you charge by the minute.  You give me your public key, and I give you my public key, and we make a multisig address that we both can verify as accurate and requiring our key.  I put a bitcoin in the multisig address on-chain.  Then off-chain, every minute I make a transaction sending from the multisig address to your address 0.01 bitcoins, and 0.99 back to my address, and I send this transaction to you privately, without broadcasting it.  Then the next minute, I make a new transaction, double-spending that first one, sending you 0.02 and me 0.98.  Again, I send that to you privately.  I do this over and over every minute, with you getting incrementally more, without broadcasting any of them, just sending them privately to you.  I can't ever broadcast an earlier one (which pays me more), because I don't have a copy of the that has your signature.  You however have my signatures, and you will obviously sign and broadcast the one which pays you the most, which is the most recent one.
Eventually, the movie will end, or I will stop sending transactions (and you will stop sending me the movie), and you will broadcast the most recent transaction I send you, which will pay you the appropriate amount.  That's the only on-chain transaction.  As far as the Bitcoin network can see, there were only two transactions -- the initial funding of the multisig, and the last payout that paid you and send me the leftover change.  But in reality, I was sending you transactions over and over, and at any time, you could have stopped everything and shipped the most recent one back on-chain.  At no time could I defraud you or steal my money back or do anything that would have harmed you.  Your money was still safe, and you could broadcast the transaction to get at your money any time you wanted.  You just didn't, because we had a mutually beneficial arrangement and you wanted to wait for the next off-chain transaction I sent you.  But if that didn't come on time, or if there was any other problem, you could have immediately put everything back on-chain by broadcasting your most recently received transaction.
That's a simple version of what the lightning network does.  (There's more to it, and it's more complicated, and unlike in my example, any party can at any point put stuff back on-chain, and there's economic incentive so that nobody can benefit by doing anything other than what they're supposed to do.)  But you get the idea:  one or two on-chain transactions to settle a whole lot of stuff that happens behind the scenes.  And even though it happens off-chain, it's still secured and never at any risk.
Does that make sense?  Do you see why it's *significantly* better than Paypal/Visa types of things?
Don't get me wrong, I prefer on-chain scaling and I run and mine on a BU full node.  But the lightning network is in principle much much different and better than Paypal/Visa.  Just because it's not on chain doesn't mean it's not secure.  You're still leveraging the Bitcoin network's security.

ETH and ETC cannot converge because they have different validation rules unrelated to blocksize.  That's why they can never converge.
As for the rest of the argument, all you're claiming in essence is that miners who can pay for faster connections have an edge.  But *that's already true*, because those miners instead of buying more bandwidth now when they don't need it, buy more mining equipment.  The disparity you're talking about *already exists*, it's just difficult to see because it manifests itself in the form of having slightly more hashing power than you otherwise would.
But the difference between miner A and miner B is still the same in both scenarios and can be quantified in terms of value.  All you're doing is changing how it's manifested.

No, the exchanges would be hubs too.  So you'd register with Coinbase or something, and you'd buy your coins and they'd be credited to your account, and then when you withdraw them, you could either withdraw them to another hub or to your (on chain) address.  But the initial buy would be basically the same as it is now.
@_date: 2016-10-15 14:18:57


Incorrect.  I claimed that it was simply another cost in the system.  I didn't say it made it worse or that it's fine to make things worse if they're already bad.  I simply explained to you how to properly define what the actual issue you're talking about was.  I then later went onto explain how that cost is *already accounted for*.


Incorrect.  I explained that small miners make less money than big miners.  Which is always true.  Of course somebody who can afford more equipment and bandwidth will do more mining than somebody who can't.  That's just a facet of having more resources.  That has nothing to do with blocksize, and isn't related to centralization any more than any other factor related to the disparity between having more money and resources.  The fact that you don't understand the economics of what I am saying doesn't actually negate the core argument I am making.

It is fair though.

It's a blatant lie and I don't think that's unfair to say.  Nobody who wanted segwit+2mb had something like this in mind. They had original segwit with 8mb weight in mind.

Nodes may or may not validate. The word "node" is an all encompassing word for a computer running Bitcoin software. A node may be a fully validating node, or a lite node. It may prune or not. It may also be a miner or not. A miner may validate or not. In fact, we know many miners don't validate.

No.  The PGP key is a different thing entirely.  Think of it like a Bitcoin private key.  You can sign a message with it that proves you own the private key, but without ever having that private key anywhere on the server.  So the message that says "I have this private key and here's the real official hashes of the software" which is digitally signed by your key, cannot be spoofed or faked (unless the private key is compromised).
So they'd have the webserver and the files, and then they'd upload to that server the digitally signed message (NOT the private key, just the message), and then even if the website was attacked, the private key is safe and that digitally signed message cannot be altered or otherwise faked.  The only thing an attacker could do is just not display that message.  But I would be pretty suspicious if a site that I know always has PGP signatures suddenly didn't have any.

That is correct.  Unfortunately, nothing about the bip148 discussion has to do with the code.  It has to do with how the people in the Bitcoin space will act and what code they will choose to run.


Yes, those are accurate descriptions of how the network operates.  Those facts are not in dispute.  What is disputed is the claim that bip148's split chain will become the longest PoW chain after some reasonable amount of time.


Actually, it is known that the majority of miners do NOT fully validate.  They don't waste the resources on it, because they know it's so costly to mine an invalid block that the chances of other miners doing it is low enough that they don't need to bother validating.  That's why we had that 6 blocks built on top of an invalid block a few years back.


In what do *you* think they are economically important?  I'm very curious what you think their role is.


That's incorrect.  All a node needs is one connection to the outside world, so even if 99% of his connections won't relay a block, he still gets that block as long as one of his connections relays it to him.  Miners and exchanges also directly connect to each other because it is in their interest to send and receive updated information as quickly as possible.  So neither miners nor exchanges will stop getting blocks just because some not insignificant minority of other nodes fork off the main chain.


No, it's not.  The longest valid chain is law.  When you decide upon new rules that nobody else has agreed to, you're no longer on the valid chain.  That's you and your node's problem, nobody elses.
You don't seem to have a clear grasp on how Bitcoin works.  This is a voluntary space.  You get to decide what rules your node runs, and I get to decide what rules mine runs.  When we agree, we converge on the same chain, when we disagree, we diverge.  But under no circumstances do you get to decide what rules *my* node follows.  You can only hope that your decisions put some kind of economic pressure on me in order to convince me to voluntarily change my node's rules.
So unless and until you get some heavy support from miners and exchanges, that's not likely to happen.  Your wishing and your demands don't really mean jack shit.  You can scream into the wind all you want, but I am under no obligation to listen, nor to treat your craziness with any shred of respect like it's somehow not an attack on the network.


No, they'll just be orphaned by your node.  Unless you gain much more support than you currently have, the "official" network will happily accept them and keep right on chugging along, and you'll just be on an alt-coin fork.

@_date: 2017-05-05 06:29:44
I agree with the spirit of the post but the logic is incorrect. Somebody who is smart enough to produce a fake proof is more likely than the average nobody to be Satoshi, merely by the virtue that they have some vague understanding of cryptography. I don't think Craig is Satoshi, but he's definitely more likely to be Satoshi than a random guy off the street.
And in example A, the person who produces cryptographic evidence is significantly more likely to be Satoshi than anybody else on earth. Further evidence is either icing on the cake, or contradictions which cast doubt on the provided evidence. But a valid signature is extremely powerful evidence.
This by the way is why it's wrong to bash Gavin for the conclusion he came to. Remember, Gavin claims to have witnessed and verified a cryptographic signature of a message of his choosing by a satoshi key. If I saw that, I'd fall for it too. That's damned convincing evidence.

You "wallet" is not obsolete.  Just download a newer version of Electrum and restore using your seed words.  Bam you "upgraded your wallet".
What happened was that Bitcoin got stricter about the format of signatures for transactions, and old Electrum still generates the wrong type of signature half the time.  But half the time it's the OK kind too, so just add a Satoshi to the fee and try again -- it'll be a new transaction hash and different signature, and you won't have to try too many times before a good one is made.
But really, just update and import your words into the new version.

@_date: 2016-10-14 22:10:34
No, the point is that "centralization pressure" is a measure of cost of running a node, and that all of these centralizing forces *already exist*.  Miners who have the money to pay for faster connections in a big-block world are currently just buying more and faster mining equipment than the small miners.  The disparity you're worrying about already exists, it just manifests itself in the form of the power miner having slightly more hashing power rather than a faster connection.  In a big-block world, he'd have a faster connection and slightly less hashing power.  And the small miner dropping out in the big-block scenario is equivilant now to him (and others) having less hashing power currently (whereas in the big-block scenario, they have slightly more relative hashing power, but also a higher orphan rate).
In short, the issues you worry about are already accounted for, because they are fundamentally about allocation of resources, *which is of course already what miners attempt to efficiently control*.  The fact that one guy drops out in a big-block scenario is no more centralizing than the fact that he and all his friends have less relative hashing power in the current situation.

It's a proposal.
@_date: 2016-05-11 16:54:12
There's already a solution in place for ECDSA being broken.  Require all transactions to reference both a previous output AND a hash commitment 12+ blocks old for the current transaction.  That way, when the public key is exposed in the spending transaction, an attacker must send out a hash commitment and wait 12 blocks, and then spend the money -- and do all that before the original spending transaction is confirmed.  And hash commitments not redeemed in say 100 blocks get invalidated and pruned.
This makes it so the race condition of a double spend requires the attacker to start 12 blocks behind.  It basically solves the issue.
@_date: 2017-05-04 10:43:28
That doesn't make your case.  You're claiming that exchanges are *more safe* than purchasing hardware, in terms of risk of loss.  So the fact that we warn users of the risk of exchanges even more exemplifies my original point.  Do you see why?

You're confused.  OP wasn't saying that he didn't understand your views.  You did not need to explain them.  He understands.

@_date: 2016-05-19 02:33:37
Electrum runs a service called TrustedCoin to act as a signer if you don't have the two factor key.  Try contacting them.
Also, in the future, remember that Bitcoin has NONE of the security backups you are used to in every other walk of life.  Your bank account hacked?  You just go in with your ID and answer some questions, and bam it's magically back in your control.  Somebody steal your credit card, just call and cancel the card and reverse the charges.  You are used to having those kinds of protections behind the scenes.  *And they do not exist in Bitcoin*.  When you fuck up with your Bitcoin keys, **your money is gone**.  And it cannot be recovered.
When you take your Bitcoin security into your own hands, you alone secure the Bitcoins.  There is no backup method to get them.  No insurance.  No chargebacks or undo's.  If you fuck it up, you're just fucked.  You have to completely change your approach when dealing with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-29 09:58:41
No, Luke's 2mb fucks things. 2mb legacy base size and 8mb weight, with no change to original segwit weight discounts. That's what segwit+2mb is. Luke's version is a non-working hack that does not provide the increase it pretends to. The change in weight he makes negates the base increase. It's mathematical tomfoolery for those who can't actually read the code.

* Bitcoin Unlimited is a good project and of course Gavin is going to work on non-Core clients that support block size increases
* MyBitcoin was the most popular web wallet in its time and used and trusted by many many people

Which is what we get with segwit without Luke's bip. Which is my whole point.
The change of measuring fees by input doesn't change much compared to measuring by transaction size now that any long weird scripts all use p2sh anyway. Bigger scripts pay sightly less with segwit tx's. Ok. I don't mind reverting that. Size has always been the decider for fees.

@_date: 2016-05-06 17:32:34
I don't know why Gavin is getting as much crap as he is.  He was shown very convincing evidence.  He put his blog up before Craig put up this blog, and was under the belief that Craig's blog would be a simple signature.
Yeah, Gavin probably turned out to be wrong, but it's not like he's gone mad or fell for an obvious trick.  "He signed a message of my choosing with the private key for the first block, which I verified on a computer I am convinced was not tampered with, using software I'm convinced wasn't tampered with."  It's not unreasonable for a person to be swayed by that kind of evidence.  On top of that, Gavin communicated a fair bit with Satoshi early on, and said that this guy sounds like Satoshi.
It's not like Gavin has lost his faculties or something.  You guys need to be more fair with your criticisms.

The Bitcoin white paper didn't list a ton of industries it would disrupt or create.  You are expecting that Satoshi forsaw every possible outcome of creating Bitcoin.  That's of course ridiculous.
Additionally, you are claiming that creating a mining hardware industry is somehow bad for Bitcoin, which you defend by implicitly claiming that such an advance centralizes mining power... Yet the history of computing and computer hardware industries fairly conclusively show otherwise.
Yes, at first, when only player has a piece of hardware, he has a slight advantage.  Then somebody else advances, or other players get access to that hardware, or something else happens, and the field evens out again until the next disruption.  Over time, everybody eventually gets access to the hardware, and the community at large simply has better hardware.  Think of when personal computers came out versus how prevalent they are today.


It most certainly is.
The difficulty adjusts based on the block timestamps.  All the difficulty adjustment cares about is how fast valid PoW hashes are found.  It does not care how they are found, or whether you personally consider Hash A to be found via "an exploit" and Hash B to have been found "legitimately".  To the difficulty adjustment algorithm, it merely sees two valid hashes and their respective block timestamps.

Everybody in the ecosystem helps define consensus. Users alone can't do shit if no miners mine blocks they accept. That's why Bitcoin historically requires community wide almost unanimous consensus for upgrades. A minority of users by themselves, with little miner or economic support, cannot do shit.

If I poison you and keep you bedridden for 7 years and *then* help you get better and become even healthier than you were previously, can you really honestly say that I was trying to help you?
Like I said, if you consider Luke's proposal to be an increase, we just aren't going to see eye to eye.
It's also a fallacy to say that the specific view of blocksize increases is tied with one's general conservativeness in other areas.  That is, other developers "less conservative" than Luke may have wildly different opinions about the blocksize debate.


That's another fallacy.  If you claim evolution isn't real, I know we'll never see eye to eye on that either.  While I may be open to evidence and changing my views, the evidence for it is already available and extremely conclusive.  Therefore, if your mind on it is not already made up (although of course, always subject to change), it is completely acurrate to say that it is unlikely we will ever see eye to eye.  That doesn't make me close-minded, it's simply a statement about the available evidence and the conclusions we've both drawn, which sheds light on our underlying thought processes.

You need to add the third importprivkey option, setting rescan to false.  By default, it is true, which means when you import a private key, it takes minutes or hours scanning the blockchain for transactions relating to that address, so it can rebuild that address's history and get an accurate current balance.  If you set rescan to false, it won't do that, but it also won't know about any transactions relating to that address.  If you know it's a new unused address, that's fine, but if it's an address that has already had money sent to it, then your wallet won't know about those transactions.
Most people who run Bitcoin services via PHP use some kind of block explorer, like a local instance of Insight's API, so you can manage your private keys however you want, and then just query Insight for any UTXOs of an address.
But you can do it your way, just know that you'll need to rescan for addresses that have had money sent to them, and that rescan can take a long time.
(When you force kill it, you are stopping the rescan mid-scan, so it's imported the key already but it might not know about some or all transactions.)
Also, as somebody else mentioned, when it rescans, it rescans for all private keys in the wallet, so you can import a bunch of keys without rescanning, then rescan on the last one.

It's not spam if miners are willing to put it in a block, plain and simple.  If you don't want to hold it in your mempool, you can set your own rules for what transactions your node holds and relays.  Then transactions that YOU consider spam won't bloat up your node.
But the point is there is no *objective* spam.  There is only your own personal definition and what you configure your node to do.  That "spam" transaction to you might be a colored coin worth thousands to somebody else.
If enough nodes are configured to accept and relay it, and it can get to a miner, and a miner is willing to mine it, it's not spam.
Every transaction has just as much "right" to exist as every other transaction.  All you can control is what your own node does.  If you consider it spam, drop it and don't relay it.  But you don't get to decide if my transaction is spam or not.
@_date: 2016-05-02 09:03:50
So I saw two signatures in the blog post.  One was the signature of a transaction, and the other did not have an accompanying message and was thus impossible to verify.  I'm interested in what evidence Gavin saw that convinced him, because what has been publicly available is smoke and mirrors and manure.

No, the Electrum creator has some very solid arguments about why he doesn't like BIP39, although he does like and use the BIP39 English word list.  But yeah, it's unlikely BIP39 support will ever be integrated into Electrum.  You can however import xprv master private keys into Electrum instead of word lists, and it will use m/0/X and m/1/X as main and change addresses.  So if you want to use your BIP39 wallet in Electrum, if you can derive the master private key, or the m/44'/0'/0' xprv key for BIP44 wallets, you can import that into Electrum and just use that.  Electrum won't know your seed, but you can still use it.

No, problem, happy to help!


Basically impossible.  My math might be wrong but I believe there's 24! which is about 2\*\*80 ways to arrange 24 words, which is theoretically crackable, but probably not by an individual in a reasonable amount of time.


I looked at the list by eye and searched the word list via the link I gave you (lots of Ctrl+F) and spotted the one that wasn't in the list.  I then googled BIP39 and one of the first links was [this site]( which is one of many different open source implementations of the BIP39 specification.  That site tells you if the word list is valid or not, by verifying the checksum, I assume using Javascript.
If I were doing serious checks on my own seed and cared about its safety, I would obviously NOT be entering my seed on a website.  But for just quick testing, it's fine to use.  For safe offline verification, there's plenty of other apps or you could probably even just save that website for offline use.  I personally have Python scripts I've written to implement BIP39, so I would use those, but there's many open source implementations to choose from.
Anyway, I plugged in words close to "done" -- dome, dose, etc. -- and quickly found that "dose" made the word list have a valid checksum, and figured it was likely that that was your seed.  I then looked at the first few derived addresses on an online block explorer, and I saw they had been used, and I was extremely confident that this was indeed the correct seed.
Once I did that, I just copied the first 20 private keys for the main and change accounts and made a new Electrum wallet and chose the sweep private keys option for those 40 private keys I'd copied.  One of them still had some money in it, so I got it.


Yeah, that's correct if you just give me 24 words that are the right words, but not in the correct order.  As I said earlier, that's about 2\*\*80 combos, which is basically (but not technically) uncrackable.  I did not do that.  I did nothing fancy or technical.  I started with the assumption that the words you gave me were in the correct order and you probably just mistyped one.  Going on that assumption, I searched for a word not in the word list, found "done" and within 2 or 3 tries had found your wallet.
But at least now I can proclaim that I'm an 31337 hax0r who hacked somebody's wallet and stole their bitcoins.  Zero Cool ain't got nothing on me.

Well you'd have to know Python or Bash or something else.  It's not hard if you know how to to it, but yeah it's certainly going to be hard if you have to learn scripting/programming from scratch in order to do just that.
I'm not aware of any scripts available that you could just download and use.  I was merely musing that it was possible (and easy *if you know how*).  If I come across such a script or if I decide to write one myself, I will certainly post it here and let you know.
Basically, you'd have a VPS or something that's always on, and a script/program running that would query Poloniex every few seconds or every minute or something, and then if the price met whatever parameters you wanted, you'd connect to your e-mail service and send whatever pre-defined message you want.

You can do that for small amounts with Circle and Coinbase.
There are virtually no other options because credit cards and Paypal can be reversed.  You deposit, then you get your Bitcoins, then you call Paypal or your credit card company and say you were hacked or your card was stolen and then they reverse the transaction, and now you have your dollars AND your bitcoins.
It's basically non-stop fraud and a huge risk.  So nobody offers it, let alone being able to do it without going through many KYC/AML procedures.

Copy the seed from all three machines, and in the menu find the public key for all three as well.  It will be a string that begins with "xpub".
Once you have those two things for all three, on each machine make a new wallet, and set it to be 2-of-3 multisig, and put the seed for the current machine you are on in the top box, and the xpub keys for the other two in the other two boxes.  Do that on each machine.
Now you have three machines that all have the same multisig wallet, and each machine only has one seed/signing key.  Look at the address list -- it should be the same on all the machines.
Obviously, test with a small amount first to make sure you set it up correctly.
Once you've done that, you can also delete the original non-multisig wallet file -- although since the seed is the same, it doesn't matter if you keep it on there.
You should also make an encrypted backup of all three seeds somewhere like a safety deposit box or something, just in case.

Sorry, no, you *think* you do. Reality unfortunately for you does not care what you think. You're still wrong.
@_date: 2017-05-10 10:15:19


No, you didn't.  You thought you did, I explained to you why you were wrong, and you didn't buy my rebuttal.  That's the trouble with logic... You can't use it to explain to people who don't understand it why they're using it incorrectly.
The rest of our conversation focused around that singular problem, which made us go in circles.  I could not explain to you the technical inaccuracies of what you claimed, because, as you freely admitted, you don't actually know the innards of Bitcoin and you're just basing your opinions of devs you trust.  That's of course good and right when you don't know what you're talking about... but it also means you're not in a position to argue with somebody who *does* know what they're talking about, even if they disagree with the devs you trust.


More implementations is strictly better because of all that yada yada yada.  That's a fact and is straightforward logic.  The reason many devs disagree in the case of Bitcoin is because of how various people define "implementation".  The Core devs think that changes to the consensus protocol make a piece of software a whole new coin rather than a new implementation.  They aren't wrong to think that, but that complaint is not in fact a knock against alternative implementations.  It's a disagreement about what the term implementation means.
But yes, multiple implementations is strictly better, because if one fails due to programming-related issues, the network doesn't just shutdown.  Imagine if BU didn't exist, but somebody found a bug similar to the xthin memory overflow attack and it only worked on Core v0.14.0.  We would be very glad that multiple different consensus-compatible implementations besides Core 14.0 were running.  They would prevent the network from just disappearing when such a bug was exploited.
Seriously, the logic for this one is pretty straightforward.  And it's not closed-minded of me to make that claim, no matter how many comic strips you think make your vague and wrong claims seem better because you think I'm just closed-minded.  No, your claims are just wrong.  I'm also not closed minded on evolution or climate change, there's just a lot of stupid people in the world.


I have never failed to recognize their abilities.  All I have ever done is claim they are acting outside their area of expertise when they make economic policies, and point out the error of drawing conclusions based on highly speculative circumstances.
In short, I disagree with them about the likelihood of technical progress over the next decade and the manner in which Bitcoin node operators will react to various levels of increase costs associated with running a node.
That's not at all a knock on their smarts or their programming ability.


I have not done that.  In fact, on numerous occasions I have publicly spoken quite negatively of both BU and Classic devs.  I agree with you that they are less experienced and not as good as Core devs.  But they are the only ones willing to write code for an emergent consensus blocksize hard fork.  By all means, if you can persuade Core to come out with a BU implementation, I would happily switch to using that client.
Yeah, BU code is buggy.  But it's also the only available software that does what I want Bitcoin to do.  (Which is one of many reasons I got into programming.  So I was competent to write my own software and/or contribute to other implementations.)


You implied it.  In your previous post.


Well, it's relevant to us in our conversations when you're trying to explain to me why I'm incorrect about technical matters that you don't actually understand.


How exactly would you judge that ability since you freely admit you aren't competent to make technical judgements?
I know who makes fake claims and who tells the truth because I am capable of actually testing the claims since I understand the underlying issues.

Expiring UTXOs is a terrible, terrible idea.  To even consider it, you should have evidence or reason to suggest that the UTXO set will grow in a manner that outpaces technology.  What evidence is there to suggest that?
If you're talking about security issues, which seem to be claiming as the primary reasoning, then you *already* don't need to do that.  If ECDSA is borked and people need to move over, then *they already have incentive to move over*.  The fact that if they don't, their coins might be stolen.  By destroying the coins, you don't even give the original owner a *chance* to get his money back.  And in the event a theif gets them, the economy at large doesn't suffer the inflation of that money any more than if the original owner spent them.  So it's neutral as far as the outside world goes, and it's the same loss as far as the original owner of the coins goes.  There is no net benefit to the original owner or the economy at large to destroying the coins.  (Well ok, the economy at large would benefit because now there's less coins, but if that happens, Bitcoin fails because trust in it goes to zero, since now your coins can be destroyed.)
No matter how you look at it, expiring UTXOs is a bad idea.  This is quite frankly shocking to hear.  I can't believe you actually think that a viable scaling and security solution is destroying other people's coins.  This is madness.

Mycelium uses BIP44, and Electrum uses its own thing.  It is still possible to use the same keys for both.  You'd need to find software to convert your Mycelium seed to a BIP32 master key, and then derive the xprv key for  m/44'/0'/0'  and in Electrum choose "restore normal wallet" or whatever the restore option is, and when it asks you to put your seed words, instead just put the xprv key string.

Bingo.  That's why we have OP_RETURN.  Nodes who don't want extra data can just prune them off after they verify it, and it gets the full security of the Bitcoin blockchain backing its entry into the ledger.  There is no pollution or spam.  If a miner is willing to mine it, it has just as much right to be in the blockchain as any other transaction.  There is no such thing as spam.  You can configure your node how you like, and I can configure mine.  I don't care what you consider spam and you shouldn't care what I consider spam.

Yes, you can use it now, and that would work.  I also like your redeem script, because the scriptsig to redeem it is the same sig+pubkey format.  Most CLTV implementations I've seen have the scriptsig require a 0 or 1 for the redeem script IF/ELSE flow.  I like the way you've used the hash check to do the IF/ELSE flow.
Anyway, moving on.  Yes, it's possible, but as others have mentioned, you can also just use pre-made transactions with regular old nLockTime.  That would be better to use, because it would take up less space on the blockchain.  Payer A funds an address and then writes a series of scripts that spend from it and send money to Merchant B, each successive script referring to the change of the previous script, and with a locktime farther ahead in the future.  Payer A gives all of these to Merchant B, who cannot broadcast them until the locktime, and they can be double-spent before that time if Payer A decides to pull the coins out.
The reason I'm advocating that solution as opposed to your CLTV solution is that my solution doesn't put as much data on the blockchain.  (I think... am I wrong?)
So that's why I'd advocate it.  But your solution works perfectly well.
In the future when we have relative locktime, you can just make an address whose locktime is something like "30 days/blocks after the input's block height", which both makes your job easier AND puts less data on the blockchain.  But that's not here yet.  So your solution is perfectly good for now.

Yes but there's not really any good software to do it. Bitcoin Core's raw tx functionality is probably your best bet. But really, it's just going to be extremely difficult unless you know how Bitcoin transactions are structured.

I run a full node with relaxed acceptance, relay, and keep-in-memory memory rules, and your figure matches my back-of-the-napkin-wild-ass-guess based on what I see on my node.  There's a lot of "dust spam" that I relay but I would not expect to get mined if I sent it, and there's also a lot of transactions with smaller fees and max sequence numbers and no locktime that I think were probably made by software or hardware that's a few years old and just hasn't been updated.  I don't see as many double spends as I expected given that most places still accept zero conf transactions and it's extremely easy to ship a valid-but-unlikely-to-get-confirmed-soon tx directly to Coinbase or Bitpay and then broadcast the higher fee double spend once the website shows payment received.

In the future, don't be so quick to burn your addresses.  BIP39 is set up so you can recover from simple mistakes like that.  The words all are guaranteed distinct after the first 3 or 4 letters, and they all are prounced distinctly.  The word list was chosen very carefully.  On top of that, the last word acts as a checksum, so if you think you only got one words wrong, you can cycle through the words and within a thousand or so tries (fast for a computer), you can get the correct one.  It's built-in error correction basically.
In this case, it was simple to just see that "done" isn't in the word list, and try the other few words that look vaguely like it and find one that had the correct checksum.
Thanks for the fun challenge, and sorry for the hassle and worry you went through.  Bear this in mind when you reset it (assuming that's possible), and know that in the future, with some work, you will be able to recover your money even with a typo like that.  No need to give it away on reddit!

How are you cataloging them?  Do you just derive the first X children of whatever extended key you get and store them in a database?
Most people who get a child address never see the extended key -- it's just used by the website/service to deterministically derive addresses, so they can keep a single master backup key elsewhere.  But the users only ever see the address, not the chain code or other associated information.

The reverse is also true.  Those of us who came around early, saw the change from unlimited (or rather 32mb) blocks down to 1mb to protect against spam, and many conversations about how and when to raise the limit, so that using it as "digital cash" would always be possible.  Satoshi himself talked about archival nodes since blocks would eventually be too big for literally everybody to run one, and many devs talked about what the right way to increase the blocks was.  This was all in 2010-2012.
So those of us reading that had a pretty clear understanding that the 1mb spam-protection cap was NOT part of the scarcity aspect of Bitcoin and was always intended to be removed/raised.  And those who had that notion, backed up by tons of developer discussion and forums posts of the pasts, feel that it's rules are already being changed by force, because it was never intended to stay stagnant.  The fact that that "change" happens to be leaving the code as is doesn't make it any less dramatic or problematic or against the purpose and ideals of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin was designed as digital cash.  Read the white paper.  The 1mb limit was an arbitrary limit put in place to prevent large scale spam attacks, and it was always intended to eventually be removed or replaced.  This is a fact, read the old forum posts.  Bitcoin's rules are already being changed by force, it's just that the change is being hidden behind the veil of "we're just keeping the limit that was already in place" as if scarcity was its intended function.  It was not.  You have been lied to and mislead.

Please re-read my last reply, as I have already addressed your errors there.
@_date: 2016-05-18 11:10:31


A common argument against a hard fork to a large block size is that it takes up more space.  Many of the same people claim segwit does not have that issue.  I don't know why they think that, but I've heard it many times.


Lite nodes already save space by only storing their relevant transactions.  However, they still usually store the block headers.  Regardless, the size of transactions for lite clients has never been an issue, and that slight benefit seems to me to not be favorable enough to off-set the introduction of a ton of new code.  That said, the code is being tested thoroughly, and even if it's a small benefit, it IS still a benefit.


That's definitely a plus, but as before, to my mind, it's a minor benefit that is outweighed by the risk of so much new code being introduced. More importantly, it's outweighed by the fact that segwit turns all non-segwit clients into non-validating nodes.
Again, I see the benefit and understand your point, I just don't think it's enough benefit to offset what I view as drawbacks -- the risk of so much new code and the harm to non-upgraded clients.  The best description of my thoughts is something I think Gavin said at some point, "We're afraid we might fall if we walk down the stairs, so we're going to do a fancy somersault and cartwheel down."  I think something like BIP101 combined with optimizations in message transmission achieves a lot of the same scalability issues without near as much fancy somersaults and the increased risks associated with such maneuvers.


How so?  Can you elaborate?


That's a valid point and definitely a pretty substantial benefit.
@_date: 2016-05-02 10:34:43
Right, and that works.  Try it this way:
     echo 'test' &gt; test.txt &amp; cat test.txt
The cat command depends on the test.txt existing and having the text "test", which it does.  What's the issue you have with it?

That's specifically why Electrum 2.x only allows you to "sweep" funds from private keys rather than importing them directly.
If you desperately want to use Electrum for imported addresses, you need to generate a new Electrum v1 seed and "restore" it, and then the option to import private keys will again be available in the menu.

Gavin did no such thing.  He made a blog post about meeting the guy he believed to be Satoshi.  He believed this based on the guys writing style *and the fact that he witnessed the guy sign a message of Gavin's choosing with a Satoshi key*.
Gavin may have been tricked, but he did not do anything wrong.  He wasn't just being stupid about it.  He verified a digital signature on a message of his choosing.  That is extremely convincing evidence.  The fact that you and I have not gotten a copy of that message and signature, and a host of other oddities, make it seem likely that Gavin was fooled.  But Gavin wasn't just "easily duped".  He was presented with very strong evidence.
And he didn't demand anybody believe him or try to convince them.  He posted a blog explaining what he had witnessed and why he thought the guy was Satoshi.  He didn't try to exert his influence to convince people who were skeptical of the claim.  He merely laid out his reasoning.
Gavin did absolutely nothing wrong, and shame on you for smearing him.

@_date: 2017-07-06 06:04:12
All you need is the private key.  Everything else is derived from the private key.
No part of the private key can be reverse-engineered from an address or public key.
But you still should not give out any part of the private key.  (Or god forbid, the whole thing!)
Does that answer your questions?
@_date: 2016-05-02 09:44:37


No he didn't.  He provided the signature directly ripped from the spending transaction, which of course only signed that transaction.  And there was no other signature in the blog.
@_date: 2016-05-03 03:29:42
That would be annoying but acceptable.  The issue isn't that he made it difficult, the issue is that he didn't actually provide the evidence at all.  What he provided was not his signature and did not sign the text he claimed it signed.
He didn't "make it difficult".  He just didn't do it period.

If that doesn't work, come back here and contact me and I'll make a wallet with them and see what I can find.  Worst case scenario, they have a github for the site, so I can roll back to an earlier version and find it that way.

Yeah, having the same word is completely normal.  The "seed" is basically just a big number, like private keys are just numbers also, and the word list is just swapping out digits in that number for words, so that it's easier to write down and remember.  And having a large number with some repeating digits is completely normal.  For example, 36402151 has two ones in it, but it's still a unique number.  Similarly, your word list just represents a really big number, and having two of the same word is perfectly normal.

On the one hand, it's nice to see somebody realize that KYC in an internet age makes people *less* safe because so many organizations have to hold their info, and inevitably one or more of them will be hacked.  So I like the rebuke against KYC.
On the other hand, AML is just as stupid and useless.  Money isn't money if it's not fungible, and any AML by definition removes fungibility from money.  Transferring money should not be a crime.  And these attempts to make it so annoy/harm all the non-criminals to a much higher extent than they prevent crime.  That's because there are far fewer criminals than non-criminals, so any catch-all blanket measures necessarily disproportionately go towards non-criminals, so unless they have some insanely high benefits with regards to stopping crime, they simply aren't doing a net benefit to society.  AML does not prevent crime to anywhere near a high enough degree that it is appropriate to make everybody's money non-fungible.  It's nothing but pandering politics.  AML and KYC both have no place in the world.

Yeah, put yourself in his shoes, where you personally witness him sign a message of your choosing with a known Satoshi key.  Yeah, no shit he fell for that.  If it wasn't real, it was a damn good con.
Everything you hear about Gavin is attacks from other people.  If you just pay attention to what Gavin does and says, it's pretty clear there's been zero transformation and he's the same level-headed guy he's always been.  It's everybody else who's gone batshit insane.  "Gavin thinks the blocksize should be raised, well clearly he's insane and an enemy of Bitcoin!"

I echo the notion about why use the traditional banking system when Bitcoin is better and all that jazz, but realistically, if you want to interact with 99% of the world, you still need some interface to the banking system.  For that, in the US, I'm a fan of the Shift card.  I keep a little bit of BTC in Coinbase, and then the Shift card is authorized to sell whatever I have on Coinbase at the time of purchase to cover the cost.  So I still keep BTC as my demonination and only sell the exact amount to cover the purchase.  And I only ever keep a small amount on Coinbase for daily transactions with the card.  It's a good happy/medium for having a debit card to interact with the world while still having everything in Bitcoin and maintaining control over [most of] my funds.  Keep a couple hundred bucks on Coinbase for the Shift card, refill the account as necessary.

There is a little known feature of BIP38 known as the intermediary passphrase with EC multiplication.  Basically, you pick a password, and use some software to generate a code (different from your password).  You give this code to the person making the paper wallets, and they can use it to generate encrypted keys which they *cannot have the password to*.  They can create the BIP38 encrypted key, without knowing your password or the private key involved.  Then you can decrypt it with your password just like any other BIP38 key.  More than that, you can, without decrypting it, verify that they created the key properly, so you know they don't have access to it.
That feature was actually the primary purpose of BIP38 and why I wrote that BIP38 was created with OP's case in mind.
The author of BIP38 at the time was making fancy paper wallets (google "casascius coins"), and he wanted to prove to his customers he didn't have the private keys.
The rather boring feature of standalone password encryption in BIP38 was only one feature of the spec, even though it has become the primary part used, and what the BIP is mostly known for.
@_date: 2017-06-08 08:54:53


The attack doesn't happen "in" the lightning network.  Remember, you have to open a lightning channel to begin with.  You have to fund a multisig address that has your key and the other guy's key.  Once you open that payment channel to begin with, the other guy can just disappear and never sign a single tx, and your money can never be recovered from that address.
That's the attack.  The attacker loses his money, but he makes sure you lose yours too.  All of the fraud proofs and timelocks only can happen once you both sign the initial lightning transaction.  But if the attacker stops replying after the initial funding of the payment channel, you're just shit out of luck.
*Edit:  I'm reading the LN whitepaper at the moment, to make sure I'm clear on how it actually works in practice, and it looks like the attack I described may actually have been neutralized with SIGHASH_NOINPUT.  I need to do some more research, but you might be right about the security of LN, as long as you use new addresses for every payment channel.  SIGHASH_NOINPUT is an extremely precarious OP code!*
*Edit 2:  Signature type flag, NOT op code.  It's a sighash flag, not an OP code.  I know!  It was a brain-fart.*


I don't think it's as bad as you think it is, because of the incentives I already outlined in my previous post, but I completely agree it's less preferable than a solution with the blocksize limits hard-coded in and not left up to miners.


I agree.  As I previously said, I like segwit, and I only oppose it for political reasons.  And despite being *more* risky than on-chain transactions, LN transactions are still extremely safe, and more than good enough for micropayments.  Despite my political and other reservations about them, the technology is neat, and it is a novel and useful idea.
@_date: 2017-06-02 05:36:35


There's no between the lines.  The statement stands as is and speaks for itself.  If you try to read between the lines, all you do is put your own words in my mouth.


It's nobody's "fault".  There are far to many intermixing variables at play to claim that any one of them is responsible for the current situation.


No, in fact I run open source code that is specifically designed to fix the situation.


Yeah, this is the first of at least three different places you make up what you think I believe and then knock down that strawman you created.  That's about the level of logic I expect from the crowd.


Well there's number 2.  No, they aren't "hereoes".  However, they're also not villains.  Bitcoin incentivizes miners to create a valid hash as quickly as possible.  It's completely stupid to call them villains for developing a more efficient way to do exactly that.  That's a fault in the system design, not on the people who do exactly what you incentivized them to do.


"fact".  You mean *in your opinion*.


Once again, you are disingenuous towards your "enemies".  Most big blockers aren't trying to prevent a resolution to the current situation.  They just believe that *your solution* isn't the best one.  Painting them as trying to prevent progress is entirely inaccurate and yet another strawman you've created to help your own circle jerk.
I happen to think Roger Ver is an opportunist and I don't quite trust him.  I also think Jihan is an ass, and Bitmain has been acting counter-productively for the past few months.
But I still think a hard fork blocksize increase is the safest and best path forward, with or without segwit.  I think that because I've done the research myself and know enough about how the system works and what the technological constraints are to make my own informed determination.


That's it, you KO that stawman!  Good for you!  Now go sit in that circle jerk and receive your reward!
And by the way, I absolutely CAN run the software of my choosing.  That was the point of my initial post.  I **am** running software that does what I want it to do.


Yeah, no kidding.  I've been in Bitcoin since early 2011.  I feel your pain.  I just wish you weren't so intent on blaming me for it.  I haven't "stalled" anything.  I am free to run whatever software I want on my machine.  That is not an attack on you.  *And it's entirely your own problem if you think it is.*


No, they haven't.  One or two people have occasionally done a little research into it over the past few years.
And what does confirm that they are against hard forks is the numerous direct quotes of many of them saying that they will never hard fork.  Research or no, that kind of statement is hard to explain away.


Some of them aren't, many of them are.


They don't want to do it in ways that *they consider* to be damaging.  I don't think many of the things they worry about will come to pass at nearly the rate they do, nor that such things will have near the disastrous result they worry it will.  I would be on their side if I thought it would.  But I've done the math, and I've come to a different conclusion than they have.


What's this, strawman number five?  I have never claimed they were inconsistent.  They've been incredibly consistent.  I just disagree with many of their conclusions about the effect larger blocks will have on the network.  The only inconsistent players in this debate have been Theymos (and other r/bitcoin mods), and Luke.  Theymos is acting purely in bad faith, and Luke is just batshit crazy.  But the vast majority of the Core developers, while I may disagree with them, I completely agree they've been consistent, and I solute them for sticking to their guns when they genuinely believe Bitcoin's security is at stake.


I can for wanting to be *too* safe.  Remember, Bitcoin doesn't have to be *perfectly* secure.  It just has to be secure *enough* to withstand any attack from any adversary.  If it can do that already, adding more security to it is unnecessary, and doing so at the expense of usability and growth is damaging to the system as a whole.


Couldn't have said it better myself!  I'm glad the bip148ers are heeding your words and jumping off a cliff.
I personally want my side of the argument to stay patient, argue the merits of our view, and wait until there is larger consensus, so that our movement will succeed and help Bitcoin, rather than be a one-off failure.


That's the thing about Bitcoin.  I have as much right to be here as you do.  Even if I were to advocate for handing it to government control and making it into a permissioned blockchain.  This is an entirely voluntary space, with no rulers.  If you don't like what I have to say, you are free to fuck off, or to make terrible uninformed fallacy-laden replies.  I know which one I'd rather you do, but it's entirely your choice which one you actually do.

Uh yeah, that's how transactions work.  Inputs and outputs.  It's extremely easy to show you had nothing to do with a transaction.  You don't have the keys for any of the addresses involved.  If address "taint" is used in the manner you're talking about, it will be basically useless.  Let's say I sell drugs and get paid and then buy something from you with that money, and you had zero knowledge about my drug selling.  That's just one hop, yet you're completely innocent.  But by your definition, you're clearly involved because the transactions are so close together.  That's just not how money works.

Ditto.  For USA, it's this or the Bitpay card.  And the Bitpay card requires you to fund it by selling bitcoin and pre-loading it with that USD you got from the sale.  You don't get to keep the balance in anything but USD.  And it has outrageous fees and non-use fees.  The Shift card has much lower fees and the account balance is kept in bitcoin until the time of purchase, and then only the required amount is sold.  As far as debit cards go, it's about as good as I've ever hoped for.  And their customer service was quick and responsive.  I'm a fan of the Shift card.

Why on earth do you think they should merge a contentious change that forks off the network?  That would be grossly irresponsible.  Core is supposed to be the reference client.

Or you could just signal for segwit2x and then switch back to bip148 after segwit activates to attempt to prevent the hard fork.
@_date: 2017-06-01 08:56:47
They don't have 50%.  I was saying that if and when a re-org to the bip148 chain happens, it will be because bip148 has over 50% hashing power behind it, since that's the only way the re-org could happen.  And if that happens (which would mean they have more than 50% hashing power), THEN the bip148 segwit coins will be safe.
As it stands, the "main" chain which does not enforce segwit will currently be able to steal those coins (on that non-segwit chain), since the transaction sending the coins to the segwit address is valid on both chains, but the segwit spending transaction only works on the bip148 chain and is an anyone-can-spend tx on the main chain.  So as long as the chains are split, any coins that exist on both chains can be stolen on the non-segwit chain as soon as they are moved on the bip148 chain.
Basically, you can perform replay attacks of segwit transactions on the main chain, but since they're anyone can spend, you can choose the receiving address!  Free money!
Ironically, the only way to protect against that is to only use non-segwit transactions on the bip148 chain.  Otherwise, you lose your main chain coins.
@_date: 2017-06-04 13:13:33
It happens when the fee is 34% of the value of the transaction.
Sarcasm aside, blocks are full and fees are rising.  Remember, the fee amount is unrelated to the amount being transacted.  All the network cares about is the size of the transaction data -- how much it costs to store the text of the transaction.  So for small amounts, the fee can seem very ridiculously high.  This is the foremost issue in Bitcoin at the moment, and something everybody is aware of and unhappy about.
@_date: 2017-06-17 13:29:30
You know what, that's not a bad idea.  I still stand by all my criticisms of Luke and dislike many of his other ideas, but on this in particular, I think it's not a bad compromise.
The only issue would be properly incentivizing hashrate on the side-chain so that it has (all else being equal) similar security as the main chain.
If Bitcoin was soft-forked to force some percentage of the coinbase transaction must pay to a side-chain peg that pays a fee into the side-chain blocks (to incentivize mining it) and enable the side chain to be merge-mined, I think this would be a perfect solution.
@_date: 2017-06-04 12:36:56

Then either you're insanely bad at math (or using Excel), or you're making the problem more difficult than it needs to be.  The costs associated with running a node are known, and there's at most a dozen or two variables.  If you can't google the information and stick it in Excel, and fiddle with some of the unknown variables, and get reasonable answers to whatever questions you have within a couple hours -- or let's give you more time and say a few days -- then you've over-complicated the problem somewhere along the line.  It's not difficult.
By all means, take more time, keep adding variables, refining it, and come up with a rigorous study like that one single paper that everybody keeps citing.  But you **can** ballpark a lot of those numbers, plug in the minimum and maximum reasonable ranges, and get reasonable conclusions in a fairly short amount of time.

I don't understand the point you are trying to convey here.  My post says "could you clarify what you meant, AltF?" and your reply says "he donated his time".  So, and, but, therefore?  What is the purpose of your comment?  What are you trying to explain to me?  I'm not trying to be mean or snarky or anything, I genuinely do not understand what the point of your comment was.
Regardless, he did not "pass out".  He voluntarily used his time and energy as he saw fit, as I did mine.  It was not a donation to me, it was his own usage by his own choice.  I am under no obligation to read what he wrote or to respond in kind or to do *anything* with it.  He's not so much passing out candy as standing on the street corner throwing candy at people.

I do not remember, no.  Again, this was just a exercise for myself.  The only concrete thing I remember is the thing I wanted to know and the reason why I did it, which was that under the most liberal guesses for all the values, even ~12mb blocks would not right now significantly impact decentralization.  That was what I was curious about and what I remember finding out.  I didn't bother saving everything, because that was all I was curious about, and it was just for me.
But you have the steps I took outlined above, and all of the requisite information is readily available.  By all means, do the exercise for yourself and post your data.  I only mentioned that I "did the math" in my original post to explain the reason for my position.  I did not save it and do not have it to use to try to convince other people.  If you want the data, you'll need to recreate it yourself.  It shouldn't take more than a couple hours -- or at least, it didn't for me.  If you want to be more rigorous, you absolutely can be.

That was actually a half way cogent and not unreasonable argument he seemed to be making there.  You're absolutely right though that it's an economic argument not a physics argument.  We are way way WAY far away from on-chain scaling and decentralization issues to be bumping into the realm of physical laws interfering.  Let's say it cost $10k per month to run a node.  That's significantly worse (by over an order of magnitude) than any projection for on-chain scaling, and would be a significant possibly deathly blow for decentralization.  But it still would easily be within the realm of \*physical possibility\* to get enough nodes up and running to have Bitcoin be sufficiently decentralized.  We'd have to organize a massive economic undertaking to coordinate and pay for it, but to say that even our worst projections bump up against physical laws is complete and utter nonsense.  It absolutely is an argument about economics and the incentives involved in scaling and keeping Bitcoin decentralized.  The laws of physics are not the barrier.

There is no good ELI5 for segwit.  It's just complicated and that's all there is.  It's a protocol upgrade that most people want but some people do not.  Some people want it so badly that they are going to try to force it into operation in a few months, which will cause a chain split.

I don't know what nonsense you have created in your mind about me, but I have never claimed segwit2x was not segwit.  I very much support segwit2x, and my opposition to segwit has been very clearly explained.  I don't support it solely on political grounds -- namely, that if it activates without a hard fork blocksize increase, I believe a future hard fork blocksize increase will never happen.  Segwit the code is fine and I don't have any major beef with it.
I also very much enjoy how you genuinely believe ad hominems and strawmen make your ideas have more merit.  If I advocate for putting lipstick on a pig, it's because I think the lipstick is an improvement.  I do not and have not claimed that it is not still a pig.
@_date: 2017-06-03 12:28:16
Sorry, I guess I am not explaining clearly.
A, B, and C and NOT chains, they are addresses.  And "A-&gt;B" and "A-&gt;C" are two separate transactions which send money from Address "A" to Address "B" or "C" respectively.  The "A-&gt;B" and "A-&gt;C" transactions are double-spends of each other.  They both spend the same input, which is the money from Address A.
Both "A-&gt;B" and "A-&gt;C" are valid non-segwit transactions, because A, B, and C are all valid non-segwit addresses that exist on both chains.
So you broadcast BOTH transactions on BOTH the segwit chain and the non-segwit chain.  You submit both transactions on both chains.  Nothing any malicious node does matters because you're purposefully sending both transactions to both chains.
What you are hoping for is that one chain mines the "A-&gt;B" transaction, and the other chain mines the "A-&gt;C" transaction.  That way, if you try to spend money on the chain that mined the "A-&gt;B" transaction, the spend cannot be replayed on the other chain, because that other chain only considers the "A-&gt;C" transaction to be valid and it thinks B has no money to spend
That's what you're hoping for.  One of the tx's is mined on one chain and the other tx is mined on the other chain.  If instead "A-&gt;B" is mined on both chains, or if "A-&gt;C" is mined on both chains, you have to repeat the process over again until you succeed in getting separate tx's mined on each chain.
There is no malicious transaction in this process.  Nothing any malicious node can do to interfere.  You are creating the double-spend yourself, and broadcasting the double-spend and the original tx onto both chains.  And you don't care which tx is mined, because you own Addresses A, B, and C.  The only purpose of all the transactions mentioned is to make the coins on one chain end up in a different address than they are on the other chain, so you can prevent future replay attacks.
Nothing any malicious node can do can affect you.  Because you're broadcasting all transactions onto all chains and just waiting to see what each chain mines.

You take the block header hex and put it into binary format (so instead of a two character strong of "01" it would be the single byte of data that 0x01 represents).  So you take the block header data, represent it as bytes, take the sha256 hash of that, then take the sha256 hash of that result, and the reverse the bytes.
A bitcoin block is just the block header followed by all of its transactions.  You can read more about it here:
The part of the block header that locks in the transactions is the merkle root.  Basically every transaction is hashed, and those hashes are hashed, so you get one final hash that encompasses every transaction in the block.
Here is what you get when you run (on linux) the command 
    $ bitcoin-cli getblockheader $(bitcoin-cli getblockhash 3)
(That command gets the header info for block number 3.)
You get:
    {
      "hash": "0000000082b5015589a3fdf2d4baff403e6f0be035a5d9742c1cae6295464449",
      "confirmations": 470914,
      "height": 3,
      "version": 1,
      "merkleroot": "999e1c837c76a1b7fbb7e57baf87b309960f5ffefbf2a9b95dd890602272f644",
      "time": 1231470173,
      "mediantime": 1231469744,
      "nonce": 1844305925,
      "bits": "1d00ffff",
      "difficulty": 1,
      "chainwork": "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000400040004",
      "previousblockhash": "000000006a625f06636b8bb6ac7b960a8d03705d1ace08b1a19da3fdcc99ddbd",
      "nextblockhash": "000000004ebadb55ee9096c9a2f8880e09da59c0d68b1c228da88e48844a1485"
    }
We're concerned with the six parts that comprise the actual header data, not the extra stuff.  We care about the version, the previous block hash, the merkle root, the time, the difficulty bits, and the nonce.  First, we must represent them in the correct hex format, which means serializing everything to little-endian (reversing the order of the bytes).
So the version, which is 1, takes 4 bytes.  That would normally be
    0x00000001
However, in little endian format, we reverse the byte order, so it's
    0x01000000
The hash of the previous block in little endian format is
    0xbddd99ccfda39da1b108ce1a5d70038d0a967bacb68b6b63065f626a00000000
The merkle root is:
    0x44f672226090d85db9a9f2fbfe5f0f9609b387af7be5b7fbb7a1767c831c9e99
The unix epoch time, 1231470173, is also converted from an integer to hex and then reversed to little-endian:
    0x5dbe6649
The difficulty is already in hex, but we need to reverse to little-endian:
    0xffff001d
and the nonce must be converted to hex and reversed:
    0x05e0ed6d
Now we concatinate all that together:
    0x01000000
    0xbddd99ccfda39da1b108ce1a5d70038d0a967bacb68b6b63065f626a00000000
    0x44f672226090d85db9a9f2fbfe5f0f9609b387af7be5b7fbb7a1767c831c9e99
    0x5dbe6649
    0xffff001d
    0x05e0ed6d
which together is the byte sequence:
    0x01000000bddd99ccfda39da1b108ce1a5d70038d0a967bacb68b6b63065f626a0000000044f672226090d85db9a9f2fbfe5f0f9609b387af7be5b7fbb7a1767c831c9e995dbe6649ffff001d05e0ed6d
Now, we take the sha256 hash of that, and then take the sha256 hash of that result (so, two sha256 hashes right in a row).  In python, you could do:
    &gt;&gt;&gt; from binascii import unhexlify
    &gt;&gt;&gt; from hashlib import sha256
    &gt;&gt;&gt; header = unhexlify("01000000bddd99ccfda39da1b108ce1a5d70038d0a967bacb68b6b63065f626a0000000044f672226090d85db9a9f2fbfe5f0f9609b387af7be5b7fbb7a1767c831c9e995dbe6649ffff001d05e0ed6d")
    &gt;&gt;&gt; sha256(sha256(header).digest()).hexdigest()
Or on the linux command line, you could run
    $ HEADER="01000000bddd99ccfda39da1b108ce1a5d70038d0a967bacb68b6b63065f626a0000000044f672226090d85db9a9f2fbfe5f0f9609b387af7be5b7fbb7a1767c831c9e995dbe6649ffff001d05e0ed6d"
    $ echo $HEADER | xxd -r -p | sha256sum | sed 's/\s\-//g' | xxd -r -p | sha256sum
and you would get the following hex:
    4944469562ae1c2c74d9a535e00b6f3e40ffbad4f2fda3895501b58200000000
which when byte-reversed is, you guessed it:
    0000000082b5015589a3fdf2d4baff403e6f0be035a5d9742c1cae6295464449

You see them as irrelevant rabit holes because you don't follow the course of logic.  There is always a reason I am arguing something, and that reason eventually leads back to the validity of my original comment.  Whether or not you personally follow the reasoning doesn't much matter.  In fact, I have argued with you previously in other threads not because I expected to change *your* mind, but because I wanted to ensure that somebody reading your post wouldn't be fooled by your errors.
There is always a reason for my posts, and it's okay by me if you don't know what that reason is.  I will still sleep well at night.


Nothing is beyond reason.  That is in fact the whole point of my correcting your mistakes.


I fully believe you have tried in the past and that you have found me to be insufferable.  That is wholly unsurprising.


That's a No True Scotsman fallacy.  The correct statement would be that it is likely a waste of an intelligent person's time to do so.  Stating that all intelligent persons refrain from doing so is a statement of facts, and it is factually inaccurate.


As much as you may not believe it, there is no position I hold which is not subject to change.  Evidence and logic necessarily compel my belief in their truthfulness.


Evidence and logic will.  But there's a funny thing about logic, which is that there are very few people who think they're bad at it.  Nobody who's bad at quantum mechanics is under the mistaken impression that they're actually really good at it, yet everybody who is bad with logic really genuinely believes they are flawless with it.
The only reason you have failed to change my mind is because there were errors in your reasoning.  I have attempted to point them out to you, but you did not see them.


I understand why you believe that to be the case.  From your perspective, it must be very frustrating.  The only reassurance I can give you is that you are similarly frustrating to me.  :D

Yes, you did.  Apparently you don't even understand what context means.  Or maybe I'm wrong and you were posting your downvote count as a show of how much you agree with me?


No, that's a fact.  Sure, it could be coded in Python or Ruby in addition to C++, and there could be some coding rearrangements, like saying "x = 1+1" instead of "x=2", or using a set of if/else statements instead of swtich/case... but at the meat of the code, the actual algorithm being proposed, there is no ambiguity in Luke's proposal.  It can only be implemented in one way.
It is merely your *opinion* that I am incorrect.  Just as the sky being blue does not depend on your belief that it is, so to do my words remain correct regardless of whether you are able to understand them and believe them.


That's the problem with logic.  Your bad logic prevents you from understanding correct logic.  Therefore, I cannot use logic to convince you to change your mind.  It sucks, but it is true.
Such an odd thing too.  Nobody who is bad at quantum mechanics mistakenly believes they are really experts at it, but truly *everybody* who is bad at logic genuinely believes they are flawless with its use.
Alas, you are not flawless with its use... but I will be unable to convince you of that!

@_date: 2017-06-03 15:18:40
No, that's not a problem.  It doesn't need to be exactly the same time.  Remember, blocks are found on average 10 minutes apart.  And it doesn't really matter which tx propagates "first".  You're just trying to get both tx's to end up in most miner's mempools in some reasonably short about of time.  If you're connected to nodes that you discover are dropping your transactions, you can just connect directly to a few big mining pools and submit the transactions to them directly.
But yeah, you're not really worried about an attacker.  Both transactions will eventually propagate the entirety of both networks within 10 or 15 seconds as long as you're connected to at least one honest node on each chain.  That's plenty fast for our purposes.  There's no reason the tx's have to arrive at exactly the same time.  They're both just going to sit in the miners' mempools until a block is mined.
@_date: 2017-06-04 12:49:09
Probably one computer doesn't have internet connection.  Restoring with your seed means Electrum needs to redownload the block headers and look for transactions for your addresses.  If you have no internet connection, it can restore the seed and regenerate your private keys, but without internet it won't be able to check the blockchain to see if you have any money at those addresses.
In short, it probably worked fine in all your tests, you just need an internet connection.

That is its ultimate goal isn't it?  To become the longest chain, and when it does, the previous chain will re-org into it, and since more than 50% of hashing is enforcing segwit, the coins will all be safe.  It's a clean merge and a good plan..... if it succeeds.  There will be chaos in the interim though...

That is not correct.  Decentralization is a property which enables consensus.  They are both important.  Consensus is important because it makes everybody agree about the state of the ledger.  Decentralization is important because it is part of the mechanism that enables consensus.  It is not an either/or.  We need decentralization in order to have consensus.  But, as I mentioned previously, consensus is the end goal.  Decentralization is only important is as much as it enables consensus.


First, I have no dictators.  Nor does anybody else in Bitcoin.  This is an entirely voluntary ecosystem.  Each participant chooses what software they run.  Nobody forces anybody to do anything.  Consensus emerges naturally when the vast majority of people run similarly compatible software.
Second, I agree with you that 16mb by 2019 is too fast and I do not support that rate of increase.
Third, although I agree with you, my position could be changed by more research.  What are you basing your conclusion about the perils of 16mb on?  I personally have "run the numbers" and come to my own conclusions about what the network can handle, what numbers threaten decentralization, etc.  That's why I think it's too much for right now.  What are you basing your distaste for 16mb on?

I don't there's any reason to think bc.i is unsafe, but that said, yes everything you said is basically correct.  If you import the xprv into Electrum, it will just share the same addresses, and it's the same money in Electrum as in bc.i.  So if you want to move to Electrum only, you need to make a new Electrum wallet and send the money over to it and just stop using your bc.i addresses.  (Save the xprv though, just so you have it.  You never know when an old address might get some money by accident.)

That's just incorrect.  Decentralization is a property that things have, it is not a thing unto itself.  I can't eat "decentralization".  But I can go gather up decentralized apples and eat them.  Decentralization is a condition that is applied to other things.  It is a means to an end.  It cannot exist as a discrete entity by itself without being applied to some other thing.
Consensus on the other hand IS a discrete entity.  Consensus is agreement about something.  As I mentioned in my previous post, if it were possible to cryptographically prove the state of something, we would all come to consensus about its state (assuming we trust the crypto works).  Decentralization would not be necessary in that case.
Decentralization really is a means to an end.  You may keep saying otherwise, but you're just wrong.  I don't know how to explain it better than I already have.  The logic is there for any and all to see.  Your failure to recognize it does not actually invalidate the argument.  It is true nonetheless, and you are still wrong.  There's just no two ways about it.


On the contrary, I very much value and promote Bitcoin's decentralization, because its decentralization is the way in which we reach consensus.  It is absolutely necessary in Bitcoin.  I simply don't think that raising the block size a modest amount will threaten decentralization.  If I thought it would, I would not advocate for it.

Segwit, while a capacity increase, is not enough capacity except for the short term, and the fact that it enables easier second layer solutions makes me believe that once segwit reaches capacity, there will be a push to drive most transactions to the second layer.
I think that's a mistake because it negates the entire purpose of having a blockchain in the first place.  Remember, the **best** second layer solutions do not prevent loss of money, they only make stealing/losing funds unprofitable for an adversary.  But there are plenty of big actors (nation states, banks, etc.) who would happily have a loss-leader department of destroying confidence in Bitcoin.
I think that on-chain scaling can be done, can be done safely, and can be done without centralizing the system any more than has already been done.  Sure, there's some optimizations, like preventing malleability and the quadratic hashing issue, but those can be solved (e.g. segwit...).  I believe that an approach like Gavin's original bip101, or a modified version of Luke's "increase" that starts 7 years earlier, or some other method of gradual but steady increase would be perfectly fine.  Technology gets cheaper over time.  I also think that something like BU, while less preferable than an increase with a cap, isn't the disaster that Core supporters think it is.  The incentives are there to keep the blocksize reasonable so that public confidence in Bitcoin as a trustworthy uncensorable ledger never waivers... because that confidence is what gets the miners paid.  I've read the opinions of developers who have theorized about the various huge-block attacks, and to be frank, they're just wrong.  The economic incentives don't align the way they think they do.  And people react in ways they aren't accounting for.
So I support hard fork block size increases because I've looked at the numbers myself, and I've just come to a different conclusion than the majority of developers seem to have come to.  They're all very smart people and ungodly good coders, but my background in game theory and economics has lead me to believe they are wrong about a handful of key assumptions that they are basing their conclusions on.
As for not supporting segwit -- well, I outlined half of it.  The first half being that I worry it will promote 2nd layer solutions, which I don't like.  The second half is I really genuinely believe that if segwit activates without a hard fork base blocksize increase, that a blocksize increase will never happen.  I know many people claim that's not true, but based on the actions and words of many developers, I believe it to be true.  So I oppose segwit on those political grounds as well.  Those are the only two reasons.  The code itself seems fine, and I appreciate the fixes it comes with.  But I can't in good conscience support it until a blocksize increase goes with it.
I will happily jump on board the recent Silbert segwit2x train, as long as the "2x" stands for 2MB base block size and 8MB block weight.  I think that is low enough to not cause immediate unforeseen problems that can't be dealt with, and large enough to keep Bitcoin happy for a few years.  It also gives ample opportunity over the next few years to show "see the world didn't end when we significantly increased on-chain capacity".  I cannot in good conscience support Luke-jr's bip for segwit2x, since it's designed to not actually provide double capacity above and beyond segwit alone.  I view Luke's proposal as a dishonest trick by a dishonest actor.  But I think Luke is a bad person and toxic for Bitcoin, so I guess take my opinion with a grain of salt.

That's also incorrect. BIP148 forces miners to signal for segwit on August 1. It does not activate segwit on August 1.  And without 15% hashing power, BIP148 will actually never activate segwit.

Because it's javascript run in the browser.  You can read the code.


Incorrect.  The data is encrypted with the password.  If they don't have the password, they can't read it.


What you are talking about could happen if they gave you malicious javascript, since presumably you don't re-read the webpage's source code every time you visit them.  However, they offer extensions/add-ons for major browsers.  If you're truly concerned, you can download the extension, read the source code once, and then know you are running good code.


If you don't know much about security, that may be *more* dangerous than using a third party service.  Especially when the service is reasonably safe and easy to use.  Blockchain.info's wallet and Coinbase's multisig vault, are two examples of "pretty good" solutions that are reasonably easy for a lay user to use, and offer much better protection than such a user would be able to implement themselves.
@_date: 2017-06-27 09:51:26


I agree, both storage capacity and network bandwitch usage are no longer concerns for any half way reasonable block size increases.


Most people who want even a moderate blocksize increase do not believe that Core et al will do *any* blocksize increase if the wait and test more approach is taken.  If you want them to get onboard for waiting more, you need to convince them that it WILL be tested and it WILL be implemented after testing.  They are rushing because they believe it is the only way to implement it.


There's a handful of things I want to comment about that paragraph.  First and foremost, nobody can or is firing anybody or controlling anything.  Nobody is required to run any software.  Everybody in this space is here voluntarily.  Everybody is free to run whatever software they want.  Everybody is free to write or modify whatever software they want.
This so-called "firing Core" is a group of entities who use Bitcoin and want it to have some changes that the Core client does not have and have gotten together to promote and find developers for an alternative client that acts how they want.  They are perfectly allowed to do that and fork themselves off the network, just as the UASF folks are allowed to run their custom clients and fork themselves off the network.  That is simply part of the social contract going in.  Nobody owes you anything nor any explanation.  All you can do is choose what your node does, and if enough nodes agree on the rules, consensus forms around a single blockchain, which gains notoriety and economic value by virtue of being the most secure and most useful.
As for the Bitcoin Foundation, while I vehemently disagreed with its inception and purpose and thought it the antithesis of the whole point of Bitcoin, you do Gavin and Charlie a great disservice in your criticism.  Gavin was the lead maintainer at that time, and was doing the most research -- or at least, he was doing a lot of research.  Proclaiming himself the Chief Scientist may have been a bit self-aggrandizing but it was by no means an unwarranted title.  On top of that, as I mentioned, this is a voluntary space -- he can erect whatever institutions he wants and call himself what he wants, and you can completely ignore him.  You and I both know that title only has as much legitimacy as the community gives it.  That title meant somebody specifically BECAUSE the community allowed it to, because Gavin was well-respected.  And Charlie became a convicted felon for selling Bitcoins to somebody who sold them to people who bought drugs.  If you're even halfway libertarian or against the war on drugs, or just have half a brain, you can't possibly consider that a crime.  He sold Bitcoins to somebody who re-sold them to people who *may or may not have* bought drugs with them.  Come on.
Erik Vorhees also got in trouble for selling crypto shares of Satoshi Dice.  As did Bryan Micon for running a Bitcoin poker site.
These people got in trouble for running honest businesses and acting honorably.  Not a one of them screwed anybody over, stole anything, or in any way hurt anybody.  If you genuinely think they deserve the criminal histories they got for those things... well then we just have fundamental ethical differences about right and wrong and the role of voluntary interaction in society, and it would make me question that we could come to any agreement on the Bitcoin scaling situation as well, since voluntary interaction is at the heart of that.
As for the "would it be acceptable for captains of industry to meet behind closed doors and come up with a 8mb fork".... yes, yes it would.  Because again, this is a voluntary space.  They can do whatever the hell they want.  You are free to not run the code they come out with.  Their code will only be valuable if other people also find it valuable and run it, because consensus only forms around blockchains with identical rules.  So if what they come up with has any value, it will be because the community at large has decided it has value.
There are no dictators in Bitcoin, no gods from on high.  If a talented software developer believes a change to be dangerous, his only option is to inform the community of his fears and his reasoning.  But at the end of the day, the community will decide.  I for one, support Segwit2x.  I don't care who came up with it or what closed doors it was written behind.  I care about the code, and when it's released I will examine the diffs, and more than likely run it.  Because it will do what I want Bitcoin to do, and Bitcoin Core does not.  At the end of the day, that's what matters.

Because Electrum believes that you would need to spend the other 0.00829112 on fees.  If you type 0.001 as the amount, and then go manually edit the fee, then you can go back and change the amount and it will let you do it.

There's no gentle way to say it, you're just wrong.  As I outlined in my last post, decentralization is simply part of the means we use to ensure the security and accuracy of the stateful ledger in the form of the Bitcoin blockchain.  Decentralization is a useful property that helps or provides useful properties like censorship resistance, redundancy and availability.  But if there were a way to provide all of those useful properties without decentralization, decentralization would be unnecessary.  In fact, it would be a detriment, since decentralization is so inefficient and costly.  You are simply incorrect about the role of decentralization in Bitcoin, about WHY it's important and what benefits it achieves.  It is not an end goal unto itself.
Decentralization is just a property that things can have, like being the color red, or being hot or cold.  Those things aren't good or bad in and of themselves, they become good or bad depending on the objects that have those properties and the environment those objects exist in.  If you are fighting a battle at some location, having your troops decentralized around the globe would not be beneficial.  You would want them centralized to the location of the battle.  The goal and purpose of Bitcoin's software is different, and for Bitcoin, decentralization is beneficial.  But that's not because the property of decentralization is inherently always beneficial to everything that has it.

I agree.  That's how I did it too.  I recommended the comparison way because I believed you weren't capable of doing the math.  The reason I believed that is that you used the fact that the blockchain size is 160gb from 2009 until now.  The implication there is that you believed that to be a useful predictor of future growth rate at the current blocksize.  (Otherwise, why bring it up at all..?)  I'm glad to see that you can do the math all by yourself though.  Good on you.

That was frankly a really bad analysis and left out the most important part: miner incentives. Miners have no incentive to move to bip148 unless and until it gets somewhere even approaching 50%, like say 35%. Because a reorg wipes away their previous profits. So the only time they would jump ship is if it looks like a reorg is already likely. But before that, is in their best interest to do everything they can to *prevent* that from happening.
By far the most likely outcome is that bip148 sits as a minority chain, perhaps even failing to activate segwit. But hopefully this whole thing scares miners into some kind of resolution on the main chain, like segwit2x or something.
But hey, if bip148 can rally a lot more support by August, it's possible that it won't fail. But it needs a LOT more than it currently looks like it will get.

No, it's not.  I for example believe that a hard fork is (or will be) necessary on top of segwit.  I also believe that if segwit is activated without a hard fork, that no hard fork will happen in the future.  I believe this based on the comments and actions of a number of developers.
You can disagree with my beliefs and say my conclusions are unwarranted, but given that I have those beliefs, it is completely rational for me to want to hold up segwit unless and until it comes with a blocksize increase.  That is why I support segwit2x but not segwit alone, even though I have no issue with segwit's codebase.

The password is unrelated to the seed.  The seed is your actual private keys, and the password is Electrum saying "hey I have your seed written down in a file on the computer so I can access it, but don't you think we should encrypt that file with a password?"  So Electrum is just trying to protect the wallet file it created from your seed.  The password doesn't actually affect your private keys or anything.  If Electrum accepted your seed as a restored wallet, then it's guaranteed to be an Electrum seed you have, and if it has no balance, then it has no balance.  I assume your words are in [this list](
@_date: 2017-06-20 18:34:04


I believe that to be incorrect.  Most "small-blockers", and certainly most Core developers, believe that even a modest increase is a danger technologically speaking.  2-4mb blocks is the absolute most they think is even remotely acceptable, and they believe that using Segwit to take up that space is the only increase that is technologically acceptable.
Some not insignificant number of them *also* believe that hard forks pose a significant danger, both in terms of the technological dangers, but also in terms of setting a bad precedent of changing what are supposed to be set-in-stone aspects of Bitcoin.
But my experience and research has lead me to believe that the main argument against on-chain scaling is indeed the technological aspects -- that even a modest blocksize increase is a major threat.  The hard fork concerns are a **far** second to that.
@_date: 2017-06-12 06:42:09


No, no they didn't.  The Bitcoin upgrade system is very very clear.  It requires (or used to...) near-unanimous consensus to implement upgrades.  Segwit did not and does not have near-unanimous consensus.  It doesn't matter that you personally like it or dislike the fees.  The rules of the system were clearly laid out for you, and it is an entirely voluntary system.
You're not going to get very far in life if you blame your problems and things you don't like on other people.
@_date: 2017-06-03 00:08:03


No, you are broadcasting BOTH transactions on BOTH chains yourself, on purpose.  Because you don't know which one will be mined, and both are valid.  So you just keep doing that until eventually one of your attempts puts one tx on one chain and the other on the other chain.
Then when that happens, you don't have to worry about replays or double spends, because any new transactions on one chain won't be valid on the other chain, because the input tx will be different.
Pretend you have coins at Address "A" before the split.  You make a transaction to send them to Address "B" but you don't send that tx to the network, you keep it a secret.  You then make a double-spending tx that spends those "A" coins and sends them to Address "C".  So the "B" tx and the "C" tx are in conflict, they are double spends of each other.  Only one of them can be mined.
When the split happens, you broadcast both transactions to both chains.  If both chains mine the "B" transaction, or if both chains mine the "C" transaction, you're still vulnerable and have to repeat the process.  BUT if one chain mines the "B" transaction and the other chain mines the "C" transaction, then you're protected.  Because spending the "B" coins on the first chain is an invalid transaction on the other chain, since on that other chain, only Address "C" has the coins, not address "B".  So when you make a tx with Address B's coins as inputs, that's not a valid transaction on the chain that mined the A-&gt;C transaction, because according to that chain, B has no money.

There are other ways besides signatures to malleate a transaction.
You are however correct about wondering about segwit.  Since segwit full nodes still have to store the witness data, they aren't saving any space.  It's a lot of complicated code in order to avoid a hard fork, and instead forking letting old nodes know they need to upgrade, it leaves old nodes thinking they are validating things when in fact they are not.  There's no space saved and it hurts non-upgraded nodes.

If you smell shit, you better check your pants, because there is none in my post.


There is no such thing as spam or as a full mempool.  A valid transaction is a valid transaction.  You can set your node to drop and refuse to relay whatever kinds of transactions you want, and you can set the memory allocation for unconfirmed transaction as high or low as you want.  If you consider certain kinds of transactions "spam" your node can drop them and they won't affect you at all, other than a slight increase in bandwidth, and you can ban nodes that send you such transactions in order to help with bandwidth issues.
"Spam" is a personal subjective definition.  What is spam to you may be a very valuable colored coin or other valuable transaction to somebody else.  Bitcoin was created specifically for neutrality of transactional commerce.  All transactions are equal.  A valid transaction is a valid transaction.  There is no such thing as spam.


Yes, that's why it's 8gb and not 100gb.  420gb per year is very reasonable.


A raspberry pi can already currently not run a node.  It cannot sync the blockchain in any half way reasonable time frame.  Taking 8x longer to validate blocks once it catches up is a little annoying, sure, but not a problem or issue for anybody who is not a miner.  They will still be able to get and validate blocks on time.
And yeah, having a multi-terabyte hard drive is not an issue.  A 5tb hard drive is a hundred bucks.  That's a decade of 8mb blocks.  That's just fine.


You keep saying that, but the evidence and reasoning you provide does not support that claim.


You're right, it's not a theoretical nor an actual problem.  It's not a problem at all.  As I outlined above, there is no such thing as spam.


So this "spam" you're talking about is miners making transactions to themselves to fill up blocks, to drive fees up.  There's three problems with that notion.  First, you forget that by adding their own transaction, they lose the fees for a "legitimate" transaction.  Thus they only gain a small amount.  Second, users will only pay so much before they decide it's not worth while to do that.  So the miners can only do it up to a certain extent, which has to *at a minimum* drive up fees to 2x before they profit at all.  On top of that, such actions drive users away to alt coins, which hurts their long term viability, so this short term gain costs them in the long run, and is not a viable strategy.  Third, as you rightly point out, it wasn't until recently we started having full blocks.  Before then, we had 6 years of not having full blocks and miners not engaging in that behavior.  They easily could have, but didn't.  So the idea that upping the blocksize will immediately make all blocks full with miner fee spam has no basis in the actual relevant historical data.
That is a weird claim that I have seen starting to pop up, and it just has no basis in game theory or economics.  It's a bad strategy, there's no reason for miners to employ it.  They gain far far more by increasing confidence in Bitcoin and driving its price up.  People who put forward this fee spam theory really don't have a grasp of the incentives involved.

Well the only other thing I would say is to close Electrum after restoring, and re-opening it.  Sometimes for me, it hangs and doesn't update and I need to restart it.
Either way, if you have the seed, you have your money.  Even if Electrum fucks up, it's possible to get at the money.  The seed is everything.  As long as you have the seed, you WILL be able to get at your money.  If Electrum doesn't work properly, it will be a little more annoying to get at your money, but it will absolutely still be possible.  As long as you backup your seed words, you will always have your money.

When you say "import your wallet" in the post, what do you mean?  You do not need to do anything with the wallet file.  You should just be going to the new/restore option in the File menu, pick whatever file name you want, and then when prompted choose "I already have a seed".  You should not be transferring any files, nor does your password matter for the seed.
Are you ONLY doing the restore from the menu as I just outlined?
The password doesn't matter and the wallet file doesn't matter.  Only the seed matters.  Electrum writes the seed down in file so it can access it later.  That's your wallet file.  The password encrypts that wallet file, so it's not just sitting around unencrypted on your computer.  But when you want to restore on another computer, only the seed matters.  You'll make a new wallet file to hold it, and a new password to encrypt that file.

So.... I lied.  I'm not "pretty sure" that the software doesn't overwrite wallet files. I'm actually absolutely certain it does not do that.
So I have to ask.... what is the "portable zip" you have and where did you get it?
Are you talking about the Windows zip file you can download from the official Bitcoin.org site?  Are you sure it overwrote your wallet.dat file?  Did you copy your wallet.dat to the correct roaming appdata directory?
If you just put the wallet.dat file in the same folder as the exe, then be aware that the software isn't using that file.  (I mention that because I think you may have done that since you referred to the zip as a portable zip.  It's not portable.  It's trying to use the system application data folder to locate your wallet.)  Do you know about the appdata folder?

I don't know.  That shouldn't happen.  (Assuming you do have a history with addresses in that seed!)  For me, sometimes Electrum glitches and I need to restart it after I import a seed, and then the history will show.
If that doesn't work, try looking up the addresses.  You're sure it's the seed you used before?  You're sure the addresses should have some kind of history?
Don't worry, you can still get your money, if there is any, with or without Electrum.  There is a way to derive the private keys manually from the seed.

Yeah that was a brain-fart/typo on my part.  I am well-versed in Bitcoin's technicals and know what SIGHASH flags are and what OP codes are.  That was just a flub on my part.
I meant to say that's an extremely interesting (and precarious) sighash flag.  I wish that the unused numbers (0x04 and higher, perhaps all the way to 4 bytes if it's a var-int) for sighash flags were pass/reserved like many unused OP codes were, so that flags like NOINPUT could be soft forked in without needing segwit.  (Although, again, my issues with segwit are purely political.)


I simply can't, don't, and would not even if I could, trust *anybody* in the Bitcoin space, because it's been too popliticized, and there are many dishonest actors actively trying to disrupt the community.  (Luke-jr and Roger Ver are two examples from opposite sides of the blocksize debate, for example.)
That's why I have to use the code itself, the whitepapers, discussion and logic to make my own determinations.  If I wasn't as versed in Bitcoin's technicals as I am, I would simply be lost in the current climate, because there is literally nowhere I have found that I believe trustworthy actors exist.  There are *some* trustworthy players around, but it's impossible to tell them from the dishonest ones if you don't know enough to examine their words for yourself.
That's why I continue to hang around despite the toxicity -- I need to make sure I keep up with things enough to be able to tell when people are full of shit or not.  For example, in our discussion here, even though I still land on the *some kind of* on-chain scaling being necessary in addition to (or instead of, but preferably in addition to) segwit, you've convinced me lightning is much more secure than I thought.  I am firmly on your side about the benefits of it now that I see how it can work.  The research I previously did was apparently only about payment channels on non-segwit Bitcoin, because that new sighash code is new to me, and is exactly what is necessary.
So I am firmly with you on lightning.  Which I'm very happy to be.  I don't think it has an impact on my aforementioned arguments for on-chain capacity increases, but I now feel much better about micro-payments on lightning networks.  I'm glad to have been made to do more research.
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:02:44


Lightning prevents lightning nodes from taking your money, but they can still prevent you from getting it back.  A lightning network is basically a bunch of hubs using a series of unbroadcast transactions with multisig and time locks, to incentivize each other not to cheat.  The key word there is "incentive".  If they fuck somebody over, they get fucked to.  **That's entirely different from being unable to fuck someone over.**  They still *can* fuck someone over, they just have to be willing to pay the price.
Lightning absolutely does not prevent money loss.  It merely prevents adversaries from *gaining* via your loss.  An adversary cannot steal your money, but if he is spiteful enough, he can spend his own money to make sure you lose your money.


Yes and no.  Users can't really "opt out" if a non-lightning or non-segwit tx has too expensive a fee.


That's true, which is why I'm so baffled that Core developers are so sure about their economic predictions.


No they don't.  2nd layer transactions are still valid transactions that can be broadcast on the main chain at any time.  Users actually gain more choice, because they HAVE the choice to put the transactions on-chain directly, because fees aren't prohibitive.


And if they can't use the blockchain and are forced off-chain, that's somehow better?  I don't understand how SPV with fraud proofs would be inferior to hoping a lightning node doesn't feel spiteful.


I'm all for careful and conservative.  Like you, I'd prefer not to have miners in charge of the block size.  I'd prefer Gavin's bip101 or Luke's proposal modified to start increasing now.  Heck, 2-4-8.  Whatever you want.  As long as it's a hard fork base blocksize increase.


Because the words and actions of many Core developers have lead me to believe that is their preference.


It also brings in Layer 2 solutions, which drive transactions off chain, creating no need for a blocksize increase.  Which is a dangerous and slipper slope to start down.


I'm glad we're in agreement about that.


All parties will get on board fast once it's clear one solution or another is moving forward.  The vast majority of players in the Bitcoin space don't actually give a shit *how* it's done, as long as it's done somehow.  Nobody but a handful of loonies here and some developers think that 2MB blocks would be the end of the world.  And nobody but a handful of loonies in the other sub think that segwit is horrible.


I assume you vehemently oppose UASF then, correct?
@_date: 2017-06-20 18:24:24
Luke-jr is a dangerous zealot and a dishonest actor in the Bitcoin space.  He is often malicious, and anything code he writes or proposals he makes must be scrutinized extra carefully because he is so often dishonest and acting with ill intent.  This specific proposal happens to be a good one, which is all the more reason to reiterate the dangers of Luke, lest somebody who doesn't know him see only this [very good] proposal and trust him in the future based on it.
I have nothing but praise for this proposal, and nothing but disdain for Luke.  Both opinions have been well-earned.
@_date: 2017-06-12 11:34:23
That is incorrect.  Decentralization is a means to an end.  Decentralization is the way we ensure that the ledger is trustworthy even in an entirely adversarial environment.  The trustworthiness of the ledger -- the fact that we come to **consensus** on what the accurate state of the ledger is -- is the purpose of decentralization.  Bitcoin depends entirely on consensus.  Not decentralization.  If it were possible to cryptographically prove the state of a ledger in a completely adversarial environment without decentralization, decentralization would not be necessary.  Consensus on the state of the ledger, however, would still be necessary.  Because that's the whole point.  That's why we need unanimous consensus on updates, so that we all agree what the real ledger is, and what its real state is.  Decentralization and blockchain-based timestamping is merely the best way we know of to achieve that goal.
@_date: 2017-06-02 05:56:27
Yeah their multisig vault is secure if you have a strong vault password.
Basically, it's a two of three multisig, where they have a key, you have a key, and then you both have an encrypted version of the third key (encrypted with your vault password).
Obviously, there's theoretical concerns, like zomg they might get hacked and feed you malicious javascript to steal your vault password... so I can't in good conscience say it's *as safe* as keeping coins yourself.  But it's pretty damned secure.
@_date: 2017-06-27 09:54:10
Yes, I accounted for nodes storing the complete history and not pruning.
@_date: 2017-06-02 05:59:25
Not really.  There's theoretical concerns like of Bitcoin's crypto breaks where a public key can expose a private key, then un-used addresses at least are still protected by a hash, so you'd still be safe.  But I wouldn't worry too much about that kind of thing.
The bigger worry is just leaking personal information.  If you use the same key as you've used before, the whole world knows both of those transactions came from the same place, so you start to link all your transactions together, and you lose some privacy.  That's the big concern IMHO.
@_date: 2017-06-17 13:21:03
I agree it's a more fair representation.  However there are at least some like me who want larger blocks but also value decentralization above all else.  I have just personally done the math and believe a modest blocksize increase will not threaten decentralization the way that many Core developers worry it will.  If I thought it would, I would not be in favor of it.  I have always been in agreement with the small block crowd that decentralization is the most important aspect -- I merely disagreed about the effect slightly larger blocks would have on decentralization.
But yes, Luke's current rhetoric is a much fairer representation than has previously been given.

If you're using the authenticator wallet, doesn't that mean that you can also ask the TrustedCoin people to sign?  Isn't it authenticator OR TrustedCoin for the other signature?  Is there some option to select using them instead of google auth?

That's not true.  Small miners already can't compete because the big miners MAKE their own superior hardware, live in places with free electricity, and have faster connections to one another.
A bigger block size would have to disadvantage small miners above and beyond that amount before the block size itself would cause any further damage to the ecosystem.


That's a known phenomenon though.  The fee market already accounts for that.


That's a very interesting idea!  I would not be opposed to seeing something like that.

Ok, then don't run their code and your node will not converge on their blockchain.  Problem solved.


Oh, my bad.  Ok then, yeah, we are in complete agreement.
@_date: 2017-06-20 18:21:12


I cannot, because I did not save it.  But you can recreate it yourself.  I simply looked up average internet speeds across the world, looked at how much bandwidth my own full node was using, looked at the hardware and bandwidth costs, made varying assumptions about at what point people currently running nodes would stop running them, and then fiddled around with numbers in Excel for a couple hours.  It shouldn't be too difficult to run this test for yourself, with just an hour or two of research.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:43:39


By all means, I will happily talk economics, game theory, or the deepest technical aspects of Bitcoin with you.  Let's see how much of an idiot I really am.


I have and continue to advocate and to mine Bitcoin using software which promotes varying upgrades.


Please feel free to link any single post where I have "complained".


As I said in my previous post, you will not get very far in life blaming other people for your problems.  I owe you nothing, and you will only solve your problems once you realize they are yours and yours alone to deal with.


I hide behind nothing.  My words merely point out the futility of expecting other people to solve your problems.  The fact that I advocate a different scaling solution than you prefer does not mean I "caused" anything.  The rules of Bitcoin software and its upgrade process are extremely clear-cut and easy to understand.  It requires near-unanimous consensus to implement upgrades. Segwit does not have near-unanimous consensus.
And that really is all there is to it.  This is a voluntary system.  I owe you nothing, and I have "blocked" nothing.  I have run software that acts in accordance with my scaling views.  And you are free to run whatever software you want.
Your dislike of my chosen software is quite frankly not my problem.  This ecosystem is entirely voluntary.






Ah yes, the ad hominem, the last resort of the incompetent keyboard warrior.


Clearly you haven't seen me and my words if you think I suck up to Ver.
Believe it or not, I am actually trying to help you.  It is for your own benefit that you need to realize that your problems really aren't my problem and that expecting me to help you with your problems is a really stupid thing to expect.  You will only ever lead a life of frustration if you expect other people to consider your problems as their own.  I don't give a shit about what you think about the blocksize debate or how you feel about what software I run.  And it is a waste of energy for you to be frustrated that I feel that way.  You have only yourself to blame.  I don't actually care about you.
@_date: 2017-06-01 01:11:35

If there is a fork, you'll have the same coins on both chains. You would have to run a separate bip148 client, but you could definitely copy the wallet file over and just treat the two chains as two different coins/wallets. But your wallet will still be valid on the other chain.
@_date: 2017-06-13 21:18:21


On what basis have you come to that conclusion?  I am absolutely always willing to debate the merit of any argument I make.  If I'm wrong, I'm the first one who would want to know!


Well, no, not if you aren't actually trying to determine the merits of your views.  If you're just looking for positive reinforcement, then sure, look elsewhere.


No space has been wasted.  Reddit provides the space for us, for specifically this purpose.
It is very telling though that you keep talking about the quality of *people* you want to talk to, rather than *what* you want to talk *about* and the merits and drawbacks of your views.  It is a shame that you value who spouts a view over the inherent value of the view itself.
@_date: 2017-06-02 05:43:16
No.  You have to replay-protect yourself, by splitting your own coins on both chains before you spend the bip148 coins.  Otherwise somebody like me is going to grab the anyone-can-spend tx on the majority hashpower chain and try to take that money.
So what you do is make two valid non-segwit transactions, double-spending each other (aka using the same inputs).  And broadcast both on both chains.  If on both chains the same tx is mined, do it over again.  Eventually one tx will be on one chain and the other will be on the other.  Then you can safely move the coins to segwit addresses on the bip148 chain and not worry about your non-bip148 chain coins being stolen.

"Brilliant".  LOL no, no it's not.
Ok, OP, since you know what brilliant game theory is, here's about the easiest game theory question there is.  You are playing rock paper scissors against an opponent who throws rock 40% of the time, paper 35% of the time, and scissors 25% of the time.  Using percentages for each of the three moves, what is the optimal counter-strategy to that?
(The opponent's throws are random but adhere to the percentages.  The opponent does not adapt or change his strategy.  You cannot predict the throws ahead of time or use past events to help you.  There is no think-outside-the-box BS going on here, it's just a simple math question.)

@_date: 2017-06-11 17:34:53
Yes. Because you can always call the credit card company, say it was stolen, and get your money back. But once the other guy has sent bitcoin, he can't get it back. So there's more risk for him. Therefore, he must charge a hefty fee.
Anywhere you can use cards or paypal will always be more expensive because of that fraud risk.

Of course they force their code onto the network.  If they didn't want to force specific code, they would have already provided switches for the various options that large numbers of people have requested.
Staying on Location A ends in the same result as moving from Location B to Location A... the end result being that you are now at Location A.  There is no ideological difference between moving there and staying there if your claim is that the present location is all that matters.
They are coding for a specific ideology, and have multiple times expressed the fact that even if the majority of the community wished certain changes that they would not code those changes.  That brings us to the very same present situation as could have been gotten to by moving from some other ideology over to the current one.
In short, it's a fallacy to claim that failure to act is not in itself a deliberate action.  (At least in this situation.)
