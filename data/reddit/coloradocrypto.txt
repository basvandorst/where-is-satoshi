Thanks a ton, on his behalf. He's since PM'd me on Reddit, and he seems really legit. I'm happy he's getting help :)

Well it is worth 500 dollars in the long term, possibly. All bitcoin requires at this point to take over the USD is feasibility to no longer require the BTC/USD flip flop. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 06:13:53
The point I'm making is it's worth real money. That kid got 500 dollars. Nobody is going to see that post and be like "psh, that 500 dollars in gift cards/computers wasn't bought with real money."

Finding this out. Comment karma in this post is actually negative right now, but the post itself keeps getting upvoted. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 06:24:02
Sorry, I did it to try to win over a community that needed a bit of a shock to their point of view. I wouldn't have money if I sent it away all the time. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:11:55
I just don't like people thinking I'm a liar is all. I pride myself on my honesty. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 06:06:42
He's probably going to buy a computer from what he says. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 10:54:53
I suppose you can call fake. There's no way for me to verify that they AREN'T me. But I do have to ask, why exactly would I do all of this, pursuing it after all is said and done, and still trying to educate the WoW community? It might be easy, but I can't reasonably come up with a motive.
Also, don't you think that if I were controlling this, I might have wanted to post my own address much quicker?
Also, that's a lot of 90's for me to personally level or purchase just for this ruse. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 05:59:29
I'm just saying, if it sounds WAY too good to be true, it probably is. Also, any legitimate company would charge MUCH more for 125 TH/s, but similar to Xtrememiners, 10,000 seems to be just low enough for prospective investors to drop without them crying too hard about losing it. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 11:16:05
It's a community that's generally closed off from anything other than the status quo. So I figured shock value might be the best idea to get them to figure out that it's legit. 
Given if I would have gone back now, I think 500 is a bit excessive, but fuck it, it worked, didn't it?
@_date: 2014-03-09 16:49:32
Explain to me exactly why I would do that then. Additionally, I would have had to have had that 90 or purchased it myself (I don't even have my own character to 90 right now) just to go through with this. 
I made an open offer for the NEXT PERSON to post an address to get .8 bitcoin. It happened to be the DK, with a ton of posts in between. If I would have wanted to send it to myself you'd think I wouldn't take a risk and allow it to sit there forever. 
I guess I can never prove that it wasn't me, but I do need to ask you why I would even WANT to create something that would be as elaborate as this for no personal gain. At the end of the day I'd be down about 10 hours just to get that all set up, and I'd have to be trying pretty hard to manage the new account and respond to people I was trying to help in the first place.

The majority of the WoW playerbase is over 18, so hope is he at least has a debit card (and checks, so he can attach his account).
@_date: 2014-02-22 07:01:22
Well I find it a good way of finding out the important parts because my line of work only requires knowledge of the big picture of Bitcoin. I've found the community helpful for many purposes. Sure they may not all be RSA encryption experts with 12 years of experience, but I wouldn't expect that from a lot of people who very well could be considered experts when it comes to Crypto.
Flexing epeen over knowledge of a certain subject won't get anyone anywhere, especially when many of the users here are helpful when they can be.
@_date: 2014-03-09 06:25:39
Do you think any of these people have read anything or seen anything other than what misinformed mainstream media is saying? 
@_date: 2014-03-09 08:20:02
It's still new. It's very possible it's not showing up yet. I'm talking last couple months new. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 09:20:27
I always have.... Maybe I should stop that. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 06:09:53
Even if they don't, I don't care. This guy is going to go bragging to his friends, his friends are going to want some after he sees all the cool stuff you can do with it, and then that gets the economy going even more. Short term (minor) loss for long term potential gain in my eyes. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 07:46:35
I'm not trying to fluff this over. It just needs to be compared to credit cards (they all offer debit cards as well) when it comes to being used as a transaction system. The big reason a large business should accept it is because it costs less to process. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 07:33:29
Closer to a debit card. I'm trying to explain this to people that don't even have a grasp on it, so I'm trying to draw parallels wherever I can. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 06:53:30
I really hate being labeled as a teenager. I have a net worth right now that some people don't even touch in their entire life. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 06:14:41
I don't even have WoW installed anymore, so it's all good. No PM's on the website. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 16:31:54
If you think that all of my money was made from a single purchase and long term holding you're wrong.
@_date: 2014-03-09 16:51:34
I'm not too big into flexing epeen, which is why I kept it to 1 post within about 40. I simply needed to assert my qualification when it was being questioned. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:10:31
Did you not read it? Where did I actually hate on anyone?
@_date: 2014-03-09 10:16:50

Not humblebrag. Straight up brag. Show me an 18 year old that has been nearly as productive in their life as I have. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 08:45:38
Sorry bud, but I can't believe a 0 day account on something like that. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 05:49:32
As someone who owns a company that is looking at doing something similar to this in the endgame (next 6mo-1yr), you can rest assured knowing that someone is working on it.
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:35:53
Do you sit on this sub simply to tell people you don't agree with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-03-09 09:10:41
I must have been misinformed. After a quick google search you're right. Sorry I didn't catch that before. If I messed up on anything else please point it out.
@_date: 2014-03-09 07:56:19
I won't pretend like I didn't get a lot of help from my parents, because I did. But I took about a million, made a lot of pretty good trades (also dealt with other options that are still going, but they didn't make the bulk of my money), started my own business and now I'm here. 
If I'm being 100% honest in this I also need to mention it's from my father's life insurance. I wasn't rich growing up. I wasn't poor either. I was just middle class. He had some issues with severe bipolar disorder and his insurance thankfully covered suicide. I've since gone on and tried to make the best of it.

Friends/family, word of mouth, and also facebook. Usually if they have money to invest, and see the profit that's possible (and probable) they're pretty quick to jump.
