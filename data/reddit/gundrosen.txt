I have ordered some tamperproof stickers from "bitcoinpaperwallet.com" that I will use on my wallet before gifting them away this christmas. I just hope they arrive in time.

Got them today. They look great. I will be using them with my own design ;)

If only international shipping was a little bit cheaper...

You have some valid points. I will update my design to make it safer :)
Thank you for a great service by the way. I just got my letter with the stickers from your site in the mail. They look great.

Thanks! I just wanted something a little minimalistic :)

I based my design of "bitcoinpaperwallet.com" as I liked the trifold design, I just did not like the colors or visual design of wallet. 
I simply generated a new address, designed the wallet in photoshop and pasted the QR code straight into the PSD file by printscreening it.
If there is enough interest I could always upload the PSD file for others to use it :)
(there are two different designs, one of the include a QR code linking directly to preev.com to check the current value of your bitcoins.)

Thank you! That will make it a lot easier to get them printed right.

Thanks. The public key is for anyone to use to send you money. The private key is used to withdraw your money and is kept secret.
