So when you say "they would put a hold on accounts" does that mean you would no be able to get your cash out ?
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:05:54
Yes but what do they do ? 
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:04:30
Do the banks have enough cash to pay out everyone if they all try to get their money at the same time ? 
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:18:37
Yes but I think the scenario of  everyone  trying to get all their cash out of would only happen if the bank HAD made bad decisions.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:11:07
Yeah I know that but can you answer my question ?
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:41:39
 What happens if everyone at the same time decides to go to their bank and take their money out as cash ?

   You are correct. I spoke to a mechanic recently who told me when something on a new car is faulty they don,t repair it. Instead they plug the car into the manufacturers provided computer and this tells them which parts to replace. These parts are very often ECU,s [electronic control units]. Luxury and hybrid cars contain more than 100 ECU,s and the number is growing fast. Unsurprisingly maintenance costs of cars are going up rather than down.

As a citizen I would like to call on banks to make a digital form of legal tender that steadily increases in value and never drops.

“History is always written by the winners. When two cultures clash, the loser is obliterated, and the winner writes the history books-books which glorify their own cause and disparage the conquered foe. As Napoleon once said, 'What is history, but a fable agreed upon?”

When someone takes out a mortgage there is a risk that the value of their house may fall. You may say that in the long run houses rise in value but from what I can see that seems to be happening with bitcoin as well.
