Great response. I believe you’re right when it comes to the big money and how they invest. And most people do not really understand how to trade properly or how to stop getting tricked by news releases. Weak traders are always scared out of their positions and the crypto market is mostly unpredictable.

Don’t be discouraged man. I know how you feel. I bought into some good alts and didn’t sell when they were at the heights. I was pissed as well but I don’t think $1.8k will happen. Way too low but we are nearing the bottom. If you’re already in just buy the dips and ride the rise.

I’ll definitely be watching ��

Great response. I agree about getting in around this time.
@_date: 2018-12-16 12:57:41
That low?? What makes you think it could drop under $1000?
@_date: 2018-12-17 12:58:20
It really is hard to tell. It could either start to bounce back or continue to fall into being nothing.

Ok, good to hear. I’ll have to watch closely 
@_date: 2018-12-15 21:25:23
Lol �� 
@_date: 2018-12-16 12:58:07
Very true
@_date: 2018-12-15 20:19:46
Don’t think it will rebound?

@_date: 2018-12-15 20:28:57
Oh wow! That would be interesting to see

I’ve always considered that a good strategy depending on your analysis. Buying the dip is always great if you are all about the HODL

For real though lol. I have a few friends who have come up big from cheap altcoins in recent months 
@_date: 2018-12-16 14:03:07
Makes a lot of sense. Whales control the market direction 
@_date: 2018-12-15 20:22:16
Nice! Thanks. I even heard as close as $2500 
@_date: 2018-12-15 21:26:05
So would you say it’s never going below that once it reaches there again?
