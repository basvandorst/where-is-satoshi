Yes, I agree there is a very fine line between liquidity and solvency, which in the case of banks is blurred: in theory, their assets cover more than their liabilities, however, in case of a simultaneous bank run, their short-term assets would very likely drop in price and banks would get into trouble liquidating them, effectively becoming insolvent in a very short time.

With that reasoning every bank would be insolvent.

Yes of course you're right; but this shows again that once there is big money to be made, people change. Bitcoin, at least initially, was conceived to be exactly the opposite.

Keep in mind that you pay for reducing counterparty risk with the exchange, but add new counterparty risk since you have to rely on the insurer to effectively pay you back in bitcoins in case the exchange would be compromised.

Why always those personal attacks and animosities? As someone who started getting involved with Bitcoin roughly 13 months ago and witnessing the hostility between the 2 camps since then, I've come to understand people that are discouraged to enter the discussion and decide to focus on alternative projects, which might be a tremendous loss of potential talent for the Bitcoin ecosystem. I still think that Bitcoin is a wonderful idea and project, and that supporters of both camps have done extraordinary things to support the development of Bitcoin; but I'm saddened to see this great idea getting so much negative publicity and divide in the community.

Thanks, I just found that after writing this post :)

Just to clarify, the thesis is not necessarily only about economics, but should be more directed towards the application and usage of a cryptocurrency in the real economy. The criticism of mainstream economics was just sort of an introduction to show why I got excited when I first discovered cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology ;)

And that's why most universities' economics departments are still dominated by neoclassical theories that have been proven wrong empirically over and over again. Unfortunately, heterodox theories don't seem to get enough backing by deans and universities, probably because they fear the loss of contributions. One refreshing exception is Steve Keen from Kingston University.

Ok that's what I was thinking; so the term is used wrongly, but since that's been going on for so long, it doesn't matter anymore because the meaning today depends on the context in which the term is used. Thanks for the clarification.

Thanks!

Exactly - Bitcoin benefitted massively from a 2-year grace period in its beginnings when the market cap was very low and so were the incentives to break it. If you run untested, immutable code that governs a multi-million $ VC fund, there is an enormous incentive to look for ways to exploit it, and, contrary to early Bitcoin, also really exploit the bug.

That's the question: Will it still benefit from Bitcoin's security if the transactions happening on the overlay network (i.e. Counterparty) have a significant larger value than Bitcoin's market cap? This reverses the whole built-in incentive mechanisms on which Bitcoin's security relies.

What's your definition of a start-up? The first "start-up" I could find for my research project on the Bitcoin business ecosystem was *The Bitcoin Market*, a cryptocurrency exchange site launched by user dwdollar in February 2010.

Who's the third manufacturer next to Bitmain and BitFury?
@_date: 2017-01-23 14:42:51
Oh right, thank you!

This is already on youtube since several months. Really insightful videos.

That's possible indeed, but I would even consider that a net positive given that the majority of the viewers will likely already have come in with a negative mindset a priori, framed by frequent media reports on money laundering and terrorism financing. 
At least they learn what Bitcoin was designed for, and how that this can then also be used for things that most people would consider to be morally good or right -- something many people are not aware of simply because nobody ever told them. Simply sprouting the usual "Bitcoin-will-save-the-world-you-just-don't-know-it-yet" mantra doesn't work with these audiences; in fact, it's rather the opposite: it will further turn them away.
You can only convince people with nuanced, balanced arguments that it's not all dark and bad while also acknowledging the limitations and negative aspects -- at least that's from my experience over the last few years.
Thank you for your feedback, though :-)

Thanks -- I thought that the wizard drawing + the honeybadger sign would be an appropriate tribute to the inspiring (r/)Bitcoin community and its amazing memes :-)

When were they forced to shut down exactly?

This figure doesn't include users that use their exchange or payment platform account as their de facto wallet, which suggest that the actual number of 'active' users (i.e., not long-term holders) is likely considerably higher. This figure refers only to active wallet users.

Hey there, 
Great idea that you chose to focus your research on Bitcoin.
When I first tried to grasp the inner workings of the technology, I found this post to be extremely useful:  (it's a bit older, but still perfectly suitable for your purpose). Moreover, this article gives a good technical overview ( and this one is for a less technical audience ( Finally, if you want to have a more comprehensive introduction to the system, get yourself a copy of "Mastering Bitcoin" (has already been suggested here) and of this new book ( The latter is an excellent introduction into the technical and economic building blocks. There are plenty of other valuable resources publicly available, but the previously mentioned articles and books should be sufficient to get you started.
Good luck with your thesis!

The problem is that there are two different perceptions of what bitcoin is that are conflicting. For some, bitcoins represent digital assets (store of value), whose price increases with time due to the artificial scarcity, while for others, bitcoins represent a "P2P version of electronic cash" (Satoshi quote from the whitepaper). The first is valuable when people hold it, while the second gets valuable the more people are using it (currency, means of exchange). But the bitcoins in question are the same, so it depends on the beholder what they represent to him.

Get Nathaniel Popper's "Digital Gold" and Paul Vigna/Michael Casey's "The Age of Cryptocurrency" books, you'll find a lot of information about how the first companies/projects were founded and how they developed.
