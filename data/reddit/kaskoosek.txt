You are fucking funny. To be honest I'd rather invest in shit at least it is organic. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:20:00
Perception changed. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:30:17
Buying fucking gold, don't be stupid.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:00:01
I prefer 95%.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:59:26
You really know where it will be in the future. Enlighten us please.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:54:51
You like to date old ladies? Weird, I prefer them young.

You have more than 50% of your networth in bitcoins. I know it has brought you wealth, but i don't think the upside is worth the risk anymore.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:39:32
That is why we disagree. I think it is useless.
@_date: 2018-01-01 06:49:14
I would advise diversification. You percentage in btc has shot up.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:35:07
Buy fucking gold instead.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:01:35
Pls buy at 500$ also.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:27:10
Yes you hit the one month low, congrats.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:24:40
Fuck you it is not a bubble. Bitcoin has real fundamental value, if you unzip it you will find the real meaning of life.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:41:12
My mom doesn't have litecoin.
@_date: 2018-01-01 06:42:51
It could still be a ponzi scheme. I wouldn't discredit your father so fast. The fact that you made money does not negate the fact.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:57:42
Let us hope you resist it at 7k, because it has no fucking support levels.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:19:00
Yeah but they have other fundamentals than dividends. Revenue growth, retained earnings, cash flow. Paying dividends usually means that there is no more room for growth.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:09:18
Suck my dick experts. I need to come fast.
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:43:48
That is actually how bubbles work.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:10:41
I doubt it will stay at 10k. Monumental rise will likely lead to monumental fall.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:56:46
I think there might be no support lines. The fundamentals behind crypto are very shaky. 1k might not even be a support line due to emerging cryptos competing with btc on speculative money.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:02:42
I have a feeling 10.5k is not the bottom. More like 2k.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:13:25
Stop doubling up. 2k is not far off.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:20:08
Im not very confident :p
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:08:39
Ok only person with a brain.
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:04:00
I like to watch a shit show.
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:13:16
Really? Man the thing has no fundamental value neither at 18k nor 10 dollars.
