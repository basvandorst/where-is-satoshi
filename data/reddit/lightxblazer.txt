This is true, I use cex.io because I am from a Caribbean country and unable to use any other exchange. I have tried almost all of them and only cex.io works for me. I wish the prices weren't so high, but its my only option.

thanks for the info, but I am not sure if it is just me cause 10% of public nodes does not sound like a lot.

I did do my research and watched all the videos on it, but there is no concrete place that shows how many ppl support BIP148. Why does everyone assume the majority supports this?

Ya as a normal user I would say this is true. I was just thinking about this movement as a whole now and had to question how is all of this actually being done. From a user perspective. If bitcoin is really decentralized how comes I don't see everyone (users, miners, investors) coming to an agreement to make a change for the better.

I guess talking about the spending of bitcoin isnt allowed here? Not sure why my post is downvoted lol
