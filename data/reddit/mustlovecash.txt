I appreciate all of the virtues of the block chain and of a single, global peer to peer currency.
However, extreme volatility in purchasing power is not desirable for a currency.
How is this reconciled?

I think you were doing nothing except starting abstract nonsense. It is the peak of arrogance to suggest that something is unknowable.

Yes - this is my thinking as well. Would be interesting to monitor the volume of transactions done in bitcoin vs. existing currencies - but I suppose that would betray one of the virtues of bitcoin!

Exciting times. Do you think that Bitcoin is "finding its value level" relative to the existing currencies - and is "discovering prices" for the goods and services which it can purchased? Think that this will stabilize before all 21 million bitcoins are mined?

First off, I understand at a technical level what bitcoin is. Sounds like youareverysmart...
Secondly, bitcoin very much fits my world view. However, if we want to encourage global adoption, the purchasing power of bitcoin needs to be stable.
Followup question: do existing public businesses who transact and pay taxes in central bank dollars - but also accept payment in bitcoin (i.e. Amazon, MS, etc.) - do these businesses hedge the volatility of the currency? With 10% "forex / exchange" swings per day, hedging would be difficult and expensive.
Or - do such businesses hold that bitcoin in reserve and use it to purchase with suppliers / employees who accept bitcoin?

Agreed. Right now, bitcoin is behaving like a speculative derivative - not a currency.

I agree that decentralization and autonomy of transactions is fundamental to bitcoin.
The reality is, the vast majority of bitcoin users are using bitcoin - as a speculative "investment", as a store of value, as exchange for goods and services.
To try to understand this is therefore important. To remain willfully ignorant of these applications of Bitcoin is unrealistic.

I am realist. Bitcoin exists in a real world, with an existing situation. Looking to understand the possibilities for its role is not "trying to suit my world view" nor is it "putting checkmarks in search of legitimacy".
Your comment smacks of unfounded superiority and purism.
You dont care about how bitcoin is used? Power to you. Use bitcoin as you see fit. But your comments dont add any value to the conversation.
