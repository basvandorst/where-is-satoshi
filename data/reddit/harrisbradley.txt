If he is so foolish, is it just a bitcoincidence he is surrounding himself with supporters?
sorry, I couldn't resist.  I'll see myself out.

I think one of the most powerful controls that a government can have  over those it rules is the use of force to ensure use the chosen local currency.  I'm not arguing against what you claim, but it will be interesting to see how the market's usage of Bitcoin will hamper this force.  I think it will to some extent.

You are correct, but so do individuals.

Yeah, I was reading this and felt such horror that I reactively covered my face to avoid being recognized for fear of further embarrassment.  This was, like, just so embarrassing.

I think the government has the incentive to shut it down but not the ability. 
Edit: sorry I'm dumb, I was talking about the currency and you were talking about the country probably.

At this point I don't have faith in anyone to honestly and/or accurately inform me of the "best" option between segwit and BU.  I'm sure I'm just not smart/informed enough, but I just can't tell anymore.
@_date: 2017-03-21 00:48:17
Yeah, totally.  I was replying before I really thought about it.  D'oh!

I agree with your comment 100%.  Thanks for clarifying.
(after typing this I realize it probably so long I wouldn't even read it, so feel free to skip, but since i asked for clarification I felt I should expand my point, for what it's worth)
What I am referring to is the scenario that many students go to college, get a degree and then go into a field of work that has nothing to do with their studies, effectively leaving any knowledge that has any worth unused, and also poorly retained. 
What I would bet on (not claim as fact) is that on the average (&gt;50%), degrees and the utility gained from the knowledge learned at the school (as well as other possible benefits such as attendance, experience with task/project management, finding a loved one, increasing your alcohol tolerance) are not worth the cost &amp; time, and arguably have little to no worth since many of our schools' curriculums and faculty are sub-par, as well as the students who attend; making for a great combo of waste.  It as if students just pay for five years of partying and then have to get into the real world at square one.
I know a lot of people who say what they learned in college is greatly useful to them in the professional career.  Good examples of these people I have met are doctors and lawyers who, by law, must go to a school before they are allowed to practice their profession legally.
I know some people will say that what I propose is not the case and that it is a much smaller percentage of college graduates who didn't get their money's worth and most have gained a knowledge of tremendous worth while at college.  This might be the case, and I only speak off of experience of not going to college as well as the interviewing and hiring I do in my region.  It's night and day.  New graduates on the whole are simply not prepared for the business world.  I'm sure this was caused by more than just their college schooling, so I'm not saying college is the root of the problem, I'm just saying it's not worth it most of the time.

Wouldn't the approval and use of Bitcoin be arguably sophisticated?
@_date: 2013-12-04 22:17:30
Ah, I misunderstood your intent.  I agree with where you're coming from.  All good points.

Can't be worth much less than a normal college degree these days.

Are you guys investigating the possibility that the issues the service and currency has run into lately is due to foul play by the central banks and other groups who benefit from a decrease in the value of BitCoin?  There are a lot of us who think this lead is at least worth investigating.  Thank you.

Can you please expand on your claim?  I'm not sure if you are saying that ROI cannot be understood in term of how much money you make off of an investment, and if so, are you specifically referring to education?
Degrees are much different than knowledge and learning (just to clarify my statement)
