Hot wallets, never again.. no matter how safe you may think it is, it isn't
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:26:23
Buy a hardware wallet ASAP, ledger nano s or trezor, your coin is never safe on the internet.. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:37:30
Not working well for me too, it's showing half the chart with huge missing gaps, super glitchy 
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:03:35
haha i'll never trust it again, I tell others to stay away from that wallet as well, I feel much safer with my ledger nano 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:15:08
I just wish I had more money to buy the dip, hodling until atleast 2020 
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:52:13
Hodling until at least 2020, if not longer, see where the price and technology goes I guess 
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:38:53
I didn't use coinbase until after this happened, so that is not a possibility, I bought my BTC using bitcoin atm's and a QR code from blockchain.info 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:01:06
I did the same thing, I still feel fairly content seeing how we were only at 10k like 2 weeks ago, I have some alts i'm even considering trading in to buy more btc, this is a nice dip, its super tempting.. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:24:58
spent $2.5k CAD on bitcoin atm's back when the price was around $7k, had 0.27BTC total, stored it on blockchain.info wallet, woke up one morning and checked the balance on my wallet, someone hacked it and transfered all my BTC at 3am to another wallet. Got fukn rekd 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:09:21
agreed, makes more sense to hold, would be bad to trade or sell at a loss right now, also tax.
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:10:12
Do not use blockchain.info, I repeat, Do not use blockchain.info, I'll repeat one more time DON'T USE blockchain.info.  I used them and got hacked, 0.27BTC gone forever
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:47:49
yup, I would really like to buy some XRB too but currently there is no app for the ledger nano s (it's in development) and only appears to be a desktop wallet or hot wallet which I just can't ever feel completely safe using
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:52:43
I really want to be in the FCC (full coin club) and I would have made it to one whole BTC if I hadn't been hacked a few weeks ago.  I got really lucky with my first buys, it was right after bitcoin hit the ATH of 7500, then came the weekend and it dipped to around 5400, I dropped $2500 cash into bitcoin atm's and ended up with about 0.27 BTC.
I was still very new to the crypto space, and I still am, so I had created a wallet on blockchain.info.  I figured my coin was fairly safe as I had maximized all security settings, 2FA, secondary password in order to send funds.  Then I started reading about hardware wallets and how much safer they are then Hot wallets.  I even stumbled upon a few posts about other users having bad experiences with blockchain.info, I began to feel worried but decided I would go to sleep and figure it out in the morning.
Well when I woke up the next morning I couldn't resist logging onto my blockchain wallet to see what kind of gains I had made.  Sad to say when I opened my wallet there was a balance of 0.00000. 
I looked at the transaction history and at 3am while I was deep asleep someone somehow got access to my account and stole my bitcoin.
Many nights of research and hard earned money disappeared in an instant, and there was not a thing I could do about it.  Except to learn from my mistake, I almost wanted to give up in bitcoin completely, but I knew it was something important I still had to get in on, so I ordered a hardware wallet and waited 2 weeks for it to arrive.  In the meantime I fully set up my account on my chosen exchange, got fully verified, and when my hardware wallet arrived I began buying more BTC.
I could have had a whole friggin coin by now, if it weren't for that hack, but I'm still grateful I was able to get in early, and I'm already up 4k since my initial investment, super happy I didn't give up on this dream. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:58:39
yes please 
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:54:21
Never use this wallet, I lost alot of money when mine got hacked, I had max security settings, doesn't matter, bottom line is it's connected to the internet, not safe 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:16:51
Please do not store your bitcoin on the blockchain.info wallet.  It is extremely insecure and you may wake up tomorrow morning to find out someone hacked your account and stole your bitcoin.  It happened to me, blockchain.info might be one of the worst places you can store your bitcoin, I highly, urgently suggest moving your bitcoin to a more secure wallet, even having it sit on coinbase is probably better than blockchain.info, be careful 
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:01:30
QuadrigaCX is reputable, you'll want to start your verification process ASAP, it can take a few days or a few weeks, you never really know.  Also check which banks they do business with, you'll want to make sure you can actually fund your account once you are verified.
Also order a Ledger Nano S right away, shipping will take about 1-3 weeks, this is to safely store your bitcoin.
good luck soldier!

excellent story, thanks for sharing, this deserves to be up voted to front page  
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:03:37
My password wasn't changed, my bitcoin was transferred to someone else's account at a very high transfer fee so it would go through quickly, I never had any email or sms notifications, just woke up and found out someone stole all my bitcoin, I think it was a flaw within blockchain.info's system, not sure if i'll ever find out forsure but fuck using that wallet or any online wallet for that matter 
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:37:50
Is there a way I can check what wallet the address originated from?
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:34:32
I had 2FA and a secondary password needed to send funds... still got hacked.  I also had email and cellular notification set up for any account changes or trades and I was never notified in any way.  This means it was a breach within blockchain.info or there was some type of malware present on my computer when I was writing down my seed.  
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:43:25
pulled the trigger and bought it, bit by bit everyday 
@_date: 2018-05-10 00:03:33
No idea what happened, I had 2FA, strong passwords, sms confirmation to send funds, notifications enabled whenever ant account activity occurred, such as logging in.
But even then it showed no history, I just logged in one morning and it was gone 
@_date: 2018-05-10 23:21:41
I kind of worded it wrong, someone did send my bitcoins to another address, but it's weird because there was no login notification or history, not even a sent history, just the transaction showing up on the ledger, so it wasen't a database corruption because someone sent it to a specific address.  I tried using my private key to restore my account, which worked, but of course it didn't change anything, a confirmation is a confirmation, no going back 
@_date: 2018-05-18 04:06:16
I think I would be too paranoid about trusting that person with my bitcoin, i mean if they are just going to convert it into USD anyways why take the risk and just convert it to USD yourself? 
@_date: 2018-05-09 13:30:13
This was me with blockchain.info wallet, 0.27 BTC hacked later... did some more research and got a ledger nano, lesson learned 
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:34:54
I got hacked from using a hot wallet about 3 weeks ago, lost 0.27 bitcoin, your fear became my reality, was devastating but I managed to get over it after a couple of days.  Learned a big and expensive lesson and ordered a ledger nano s, got back in the game and I'm really happy I didn't just call it quits completely, I did think about doing so.
I also have this fear everytime I use my ledger, the thought always crosses my mind of what if I open my ledger wallet and I see 0?  I feel much safer now but still a little shaken up from my experience a few weeks back. 
@_date: 2019-03-11 14:15:03
May I ask which coins you are currently trading? how long have you been trading? what resources do you use to learn from/ improve your trading? 
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:50:22
so when you look at your history is has a "sent" transaction of your 9 BTC?  If it happened so fast wouldn't their be a pending time in which you could have cancelled it?
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:25:05
Nope, I wish that were the case but I am intact a real person with real losses, I am definitely a noob at this so I'm willing to be open to the fact that it was my fault the account got hacked, perhaps I should have been more careful with the verification process, and making sure my computer didn't contain malware, those thoughts briefly crossed my mind but I figured nahhh it won't happen to me. 
I was heavily researching how to keep my coin extra secure last night, wish I had made a paper storage or had a proper hard drive, I still want to buy bitcoin but the next time I do I will store if offline for sure. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:35:19
Thanks, I'm going to look into it 
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:53:16
what does sweep mean? I have not moved any coins, I only recently signed up to blockchain a few days ago, I've only received bitcoins through buying them at an bitcoin ATM 
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:53:28
Any wallets you can recommend for the future?  Coinbase doesn't sound so great, I had plans to get a Trezor before all this happened, could I use Trezor as an online wallet before transferring BTC to the Trezor hard drive? 
I would like to buy BTC again as I still believe in its potential, but this time I will have the hard drive ready to go from day 1, so my plan is to buy BTC, then once the transfer is complete immediately store it onto my Trezor 
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:25:11
I never showed them to anyone or stored them on a computer, I just wrote them down on paper when creating my account and that was that.  
The only thing I can think of is after I wrote them down it prompted me to type out 4 of my words, like  corresponds to _____ to confirm I have my words in the correct order 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:21:58
So that's how it happened, interesting stuff 
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:55:00
I looked at my history on the website and their is nothing but the sent transaction, I checked my email and their was nothing, no messages on my phone either, I also checked my emails trash and no luck either, I think it was a planned attack tho because it happened right at 3am when I would be in deep sleep, most minimal chance of me waking up and checking the account.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:07:02
nope, I got absolutely no notifications anywhere, I've checked all the security settings on my account and nothing was changed
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:51:44
My seed was not stored in my email or anywhere else online that I am aware of, only on a piece of paper that I kept somewhere safe, I am pretty new to all of this, only started buying bitcoin a few days ago.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:59:04
I just finished reading an article about a guy losing $8k in bitcoin because someone hacked his account through his phone, as in they contacted his cell phone provider and got access to his account through their cell phone.  I'm going to phone my provider to see if their is any suspicious history.  I lost $2k because of this, quite an expensive lesson...
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:20:43
Just on paper as far as I know
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:27:21
my 2fa was with google authenticator, and my phone was set up to receive an sms in the event of a transaction, receiving or sending.  How does a seed become compromised?  
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:01:19
I do not know if I have any malware on this computer, it's been years since I did a hard reset so that could definitely be possible, yes I had 2fa
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:58:04
I'm sorry for your loss, because it happened so fast do you think it was a bot that was just waiting for you to deposit your BTC?  Do you have hope you will ever get you BTC back? future plans for storage? I'll never use blockchain.info again
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:39:06
Thank you, I just read the post of that guy losing $65k, that is an insane amount.  I can see why you came to that conclusion as my post is similar to his, no harm done
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:38:41
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:05:45
I also just noticed that mine had a very high transaction fee as well 
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:21:50
I will be using a different wallet next time forsure 
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:36:36
nope, Mac 
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:40:05
This was my favorite meme to come out of the 9000 price when it first broke 
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:30:08
I sent some BTC to Binance about 1 hour ago, sent from a ledger nano selecting the normal fee, nothings been confirmed yet, anybody tried sending lately? 
wondering if i'm going to have to wait a few hours or days until it gets confirmed, I figured I would have been ok using the normal fee, I sent another one with (high fee) to make it go faster, stressful when my coins floating around the blockchain!
