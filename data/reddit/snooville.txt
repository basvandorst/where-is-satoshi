I thought you said you didn't have much fiat? Inflation primarily affects people who hold the currency in question. If your money is in assets like a house, car or shares in some company then you won't be affected as much by inflation. Those assets' prices will rise as the value of fiat falls.
@_date: 2015-06-20 05:55:44


Not necessarily. If stocks offer better returns than inflationary bitcoin then people will switch to those. A loose monetary policy leads to asset bubbles but not necessarily bubbles in all types of assets at the same time or to the same extent.

No that's not it. It's too volatile and hard to get. In countries where people know about it they already have a well developed financial system and people don't see the benefit of bitcoin for day to day shopping. 
The deflationary aspect is not a big deal because gold was used as a currency for millenia and people bought and sold then. Besides if you've ever spent money on electronics then you've bought something that  rewards those who buy late. You could have waited a few months longer and gotten a quad core device instead of a dual core one for the same money. Or waited a year and gotten an octa core one and so on and on.

If you already have coins there they will be combined anyway. Dust doesn't change anything. If you don't have coins there then it does change things. A good reason to use a coin control wallet.
Not a big deal though IMO. All transactions are public anyway and bitcoin is not the currency to use if you want to stay anonymous.

The answer is above. Read it:


To put it into perspective current limit is 1MB but we haven't had a block that size yet. Larger blocks have higher latency so miners avoid them. They prefer smaller blocks because the chances of them becoming orphans is lower than larger blocks.

Purpose of the fees is to prevent spamming not to restrict usage.
Bitcoin is actually a very expensive payment system. As Peter Todd said if it weren't irreversible it would just be a much more expensive version of fiat. If transaction fees are low it's because miners are being compensated through inflation and that's a cost the holders are bearing. 
Higher transaction fees are inevitable as the block subsidy falls. They are fairer than inflation too because those who use the network pay for it while those who just let their coins sit don't.
@_date: 2015-06-15 03:11:51
Most people don't need this level of security so they won't run nodes. You are also ignoring the cost side of the equation. Running a full node takes a lot of resources.
Running a full node and running a full node that allows incoming connections, and therefore helps the network, are two different things. The latter requires opening up or forwarding ports and does no provide *any* benefit to the owner of the node. If anything it might be a security risk.
Node count will continue to fall. Bitcoin will become centralized.

brain wallets are perfectly safe as long as the secret phrase is generated randomly by a computer. If *you* are going to select it then it's not going to be random and it won't be safe.

If you want a multisig brain wallet then electrum supports [that as well]( but again it'll be a computer generated mnemonic.

Why are they expensive? Don't they maintain audit logs? Regulations will apply to a blockchain based database too. 


Bitcoin's blockchain is only immutable because you have so much mining power securing it. A smaller blockchain will not be immutable because the hashing power securing it will be limited. I'm assuming they are not going to allow all and sundry to mine in their blockchain but limit access to other banks? So there is no benefit to be had with a private blockchain.

Backwards compatible with previous versions. In the case of XT I mean all versions of bitcoin core and other non-XT bitcoin clients to date. Those who don't switch from core to xt are going to be following a different set of rules for what blocks are allowed and what blocks aren't. So when they encounter a block that is greater than 1MB in size they are not going to relay that. The XT nodes are and eventually it will be confirmed in an XT chain. That will be when we have a hard fork. Different chains for core and XT.

you can try double spends quite easily but getting them to work is hard. any node that knows about the original transaction is going to reject the new one. so you will need an agreement with mining pools and you will have to hope they mine the next block. All that won't come cheap. pretty much rules out small value transactions. for larger transactions the recipient won't be foolish enough to accept zero conf transactions.

Most of the developers want the fees to increase as a solution. The blocksize does not have to increase. With the fee increase only genuine transactions will be mined so you don't have to increase the blocksize. If you do increase the blocksize the fee will not increase because now you have more space while demand for space will be the same.
It's basically demand and supply. What you've suggested is both higher prices and more supply which just can't happen.

Because these are artificial restrictions that were imposed to prevent spam and a DDoS of the network. I don't see a good reason to impose higher minimum fees. The entire argument behind having a larger max blocksize is to prevent fees from going up. 
Otherwise you can retain the current max blocksize and fees will go up and things will chug along just fine. People who want to save on fees will switch to off-chain systems and things like Lightning once it has been developed.

But it's not immutable. The bitcoin blockchain is but a private blockchain is never going to be immutable simply because there isn't enough hashing power securing the private blockchain. 


Outside auditing is required because the regulators don't trust rules set and enforced by the banks. So this is a non-starter. If you are willing to trust the banks then why bother with a blockchain at all? Just use a centralized database and add timestamps or cryptographic hashes to everything. 


That makes no sense. multisig is used when you have to sign transactions. hashing is a lottery that you bruteforce and has nothing to do with signing transactions so multisig doesn't come into play. you don't understand how bitcoin works.

Governments for one. There is no clarity with regard to regulations governing bitcoin in the vast majority of the planet. So you could face government action if you did this.
The biggest reason though is the lack of demand for such a service. Bitcoin is so niche and there are so few users. Where there is demand [there *are* people]( who do this but again they are very afraid of government action and have to bear the risk of theft as well. If regulations existed they might be able to get insurance like forex dealers can but they can't so the added risk is there.

After a pump you always have a dump so that people can take profit. That's what's going on now. The excuse this time is XT/Fork worries when everyone knows the fork, if any, isn't happening until Jan 2016.

An SPV wallet like one powered by bitcoinj connects to bitcoin full nodes and gets blockchain data from them. It doesn't download the whole blockchain. It trusts the peers when they tell it that a certain chain is the longest. Relevant: 
A wallet that relies on a central server like Electrum could be called an API wallet. This wallet will only connect to one or more servers and speak to the server using the API there. It will implicitly trust what the servers tell it and it won't download the whole blockchain.

Fees will eventually be determined by the market. It's the natural outcome. 
*Minimum* fees can only be set so high before people start to grumble. As an example see the bitcointalk threads regarding the 5430 satoshi minimum transaction output limit. 
I suppose it's the nature of things that if you artificially restrict people they will rebel. The blocksize limit of 1MB is an example of that as well. Some people decided that was too low and created XT.
So that's the reason why artificial restrictions, be they in shape of max blocksize or minimum fees, don't always work

A fee market was always the plan. For a long time now bitcoin core has been setting default fees and everyone has gone along with that. But eventually it was expected that a fee market will develop. Not only is it better than a default fee set by the devs (in terms of capitalist ideology) but it is also inevitable in the long term because the block subsidy will decline and miners will have to rely on transaction fees to finance their operations so fees have to increase to compensate them.

Fact is the Chinese were the first in human history to invent fiat. Marco polo came back with tales of how the Chinese treated paper money like westerners treat gold and silver. They know better than anyone how this game works.
The reason developing countries buy US treasuries is that they have to maintain huge foreign exchange reserves to finance imports. They can't keep that money lying idle. They have to put it to work and treasuries are the only option if you have trillions of dollars in reserves. No other market is as large or as liquid. So it is a matter of necessity. As long as the USD is the world's foremost trading currency they have to keep reserves of it and that means hold treasuries.
The USD remains the world's leading currency because if you stop taking it for your exports you get bombed to the stone age. It's happened to so many middle eastern countries that we've lost count.

why bitcoin wouldn't qualify:
- it's not gold or silver
- it's controlled by non-muslims. whether they be the coders, the early adopters who wield disproportionate influence or the exchange owners. you are not allowed to keep money with non-muslims.
- it is highly inflationary for a good few years more. that's usury right there
- it is debt-based. the promise is that the early adopters won't sell and crash the market. "trust us we promise not to do it"
- the other promise is that the majority will not agree to an increase in the max limit of 21 million. that might change. majorities have made foolish decisions before. example choosing hitler or dubya as a leader. gold and silver are naturally rare unlike bitcoin which is made up of software which can easily be changed.

it is overkill because of all the passwords he'll have to remember. it's also rubbish security. asymmetric encryption with his gpg public key is a lot more secure because the private key remains on a separate device from the backup file. symmetric encryption with passwords can be cracked through clever brute forcing. you can't crack asymmetric encryption (done properly - 2048 bit or greater RSA gpg key) through brute force attacks.

2 is incorrect. It depends on the wallet.
@_date: 2015-07-02 19:05:54


This is correct. Did you backup a seed mnemonic when you created the wallet? Usually 12-24 English words.  It's enough to recover all your private keys.
Seeds can't be bruteforced. They are a minimum of 128 bit random numbers sometimes represented as human friendly words (still random just encoded for human friendliness). 
Wallet passwords, used to encrypt the seed before writing it to disk, can be bruteforced if the attacker has the wallet file and enough time on their hands. Don't let them get the wallet file and you'll be ok.

Why do they keep saying bitcoin without knowing what it entails? Just read this:




A centralized ewallet doesn't need bitcoin technology. It would be worse off with a blockchain instead of a centrally managed database backing it. You only need a blockchain if you don't want centralization and all that entails (censorship, reversible transactions)

It's a full node out of the box but to really benefit the network you need to forward ports manually.
Also for a full node to add to network security you actually need to use it to verify and relay transactions in your wallet. Otherwise it does no one any good.

It's not insecure because security is not needed :)? Is that really what you are saying?
It is insecure because any of the miners can modify past transactions. If you already trust the miners then no point in using the blockchain at all. Just use a relational database.

The cheaper contract would be settled later right? They have to wait for the data to be made public before they can steal it so it might be a few milliseconds to seconds later. Isn't that going to cause problems? You could wait for the expensive contract to release and then automatically make a winning bet with the cheaper contract before it settles.

You can't keep up with new transactions in blockchain on a PC from 95. You'll fall behind. A PC that old won't even have enough secondary storage to store the blockchain and RAM to work on it. It is impossible.
And no you [*can't* verify transactions by hand]( You have to compare the public key in the transaction with the address the inputs were sent to. Since you can't compute the address you can't do this step. There are likely other steps you can't do either. SHA256sums are used throughout.

All bitcoin transactions are public. If you are trying to stay anonymous this is the wrong currency to use.
People who want to buy a large amount create a relationship with an exchange. By relationship I mean you fork over all your personal info and they let you trade with them. Then you slowly accumulate bitcoin over time. You can't buy a large amount quickly. It'll set of alarm bells.

I would really like to see core get deterministic. A core developer is the inventor of deterministic wallets but he hasn't managed to implement it in bitcoin core yet. So I'd like to see this happen first. It'll make bitcoin losses due to stale backups a thing of the past.

This would be pointless because your wallet software will always tell you if the address is mistyped. What it can't tell you is if the private key for that address exists or not and if it does who has it. So it's totally pointless to send small test amounts. 
What said was correct. Secure the private key first. Then send the bitcoin to the corresponding address. If it's a large amount don't use bitaddress.org at all. Use bitcoin core because it does internal checking of the private key that no other wallet does:

What about them? ASIC stands for application specific integrated circuit. It's mining logic implemented in hardware. It's a hell of a lot faster at mining than a general purpose CPU like the core2duo you have there. The C2D is designed to run all sorts of software while the ASIC does mining and only mining.
The evolution of mining was like this:
general purpose CPUs to GPUs (graphics cards) to FPGAs to ASICs
What you are trying to do is mine with first gen hardware. Those days are long gone. 
What you can try is look into some alt coins that have weird algos for which no ASIC miner has been made. Those could be profitably mined with a CPU and then you can maybe sell the altcoin for btc.

That's exactly how all bitcoin wallets work. They discover transactions and balances by scanning the blockchain.

You need the wallet backup with the private keys. Multibit classic does not have "wallet words", mnemonics or anything like that. It generates a random private key for every address and this private key is not connected to any other address' private key.
If you don't have the wallet backup then look into data recovery services. I hear prices start at $300. You could also try it yourself using software but the chances of doing more damage are always there. But I suppose if you can't afford a professional service then trying it yourself is probably your best bet.

What benefits? A private blockchain without the network hash rate that many miners bring to secure the bitcoin blockchain is worth nothing. A private blockchain with a dozen or so miners only will not be secure. It makes no sense to go through the rigmarole of having miners and blockchain and all that jazz. Just use a relational database and if you need "security" then periodically hash the content and post to the bitcoin blockchain (anchor it).

Yes but depending on your country some sellers will ask you to provide them with ID and shit. Basically the same third degree treatment you would go through with coinbase except it's with an individual seller. Why? Because in western countries bank transfers are reversible and people get their online bank accounts hacked all the time so the seller is taking a huge risk dealing with you. To reduce his risk he will ask for ID and shit.
Coinbase is definitely better because the rate is going to be better with them and they are regulated (somewhat).

Armory *is* bitcoin core + HD wallet.

SPV wallets query full nodes (computers running bitcoin core mainly) for transaction data related to addresses in the user's wallet. So the addresses are exposed and the user's privacy is compromised.
In the case of mycelium there is a server component as well that is closed source and questions have been raised about that. Among other things its used for the local trader feature to determine the chances of a certain transaction being double spent. I think it gets told your addresses as well.
Full nodes don't need to reveal addresses to get transaction data since they have the entire blockchain locally on the hard drive.
With both SPV and full nodes there is a leak of information when you spend your bitcoins because the spend transaction is broadcast on the network and the nodes that receive it from you will know that the addresses your are spending from belong to you.

well thank you for the cryptic responses. if you are not spending those coins they can't be tied to your other addresses so there is no loss of privacy. as for blockchain spam an op_return transaction is only required when paying to a new payment code the first time. stealth addresses required one for every transaction. so i think this is an improvement.

Window.crypto is [an interface]( that modern browsers offer for getting cryptographically secure random numbers. The if statement above is checking whether that's available. If it is available it tries to use it. If not it silently proceeds with various predictable things like the time, the browser name etc to seed the random number generator.

Yes there are but they are not going to publicize them. Regulated entities dealing in bitcoin will inform law enforcement of any suspicious transactions. These entities will build a database of blacklisted addresses which will destroy bitcoin fungibility. So a lot's going on behind the scenes to prevent bitcoin from being used for criminal activities but they are not going to advertise this for obvious reasons.

How many times is the most important question to ask. If it's one off then use the new type of remittance services like azimo instead of bitcoin. If it's a regular thing then look into bitcoin exchanges in those countries, their kyc requirements and fees and see if it's worth the hassle and cost. Don't forget to account for exchange rate risk because bitcoin is very volatile.

Ok then your wallet may have been corrupted. I suggest starting from scratch. To do that you have to backup your wallet directory (just in case) and then delete it so that electrum creates a new one in its place. The location of the wallet directory depends on your OS. Find it in the list below:
Once you've made a back up of and deleted the wallet directory run electrum and try a restore from seed. It should work this time. 
If it doesn't make sure you deleted everything and not just the wallets. Files like config and blockchain headers should be nuked too.

You have to coax the other wallet (copay) to generate the new change address. Otherwise it doesn't know it has to do that. Only the wallet which you used to conduct the transaction knows it has to do that. The other one won't. So do this:

CAD is not USD. There are more USD outside the US than within the US. The USD is the world's foremost reserve currency. It became that because all the oil exporting countries in the middle east were forced to accept it as the only currency they would take in exchange for their oil. Because most countries  are oil importers and they need oil to power their economies they have to hold reserves of USD to pay for it and so gradually all trade starts to take place in USD and you see where I'm going with this? 
Without demand for USD from non-americans the USD would be worth a fraction of what it currently is. That would have a huge impact on the American economy, the ability of the US to wage war, bribe foreign governments etc. The whole house of cards falls down.

Yes and maybe. All the private keys in your wallet are derived from those 12 words so those 12 words are a sufficient backup. Maybe  because deterministic wallets have horrible inter-wallet compatibility. See this matrix spreadsheet linked [here]( Click on the mnemonic tab and see which wallets will take a mycelium mnemonic.
Mycelium mnemonic is compatible with trezor web wallet and wallet32 which is another android wallet.
BTW even without a ready made wallet software you can recover the individual private keys using a site like  because bip32/39/44 are all documented standards (which unfortunately have gotten poor adoption but they are documented nevertheless).
