so then try only accepting 0 conf at &gt;5 sat per kb?
not that 0 conf has ever been acceptable at scale, even in the early days when blocks were filled with cheap spammy crap and still had room to spare, before it was '0 conf' and instead known as ['fast payments'](

unless you want it moved soon it doesn't need a bump, [here]( are the mempool stats if you dont have them, you can use that to set your fees accordingly

If there are no buyers at your set price it will liquidate for less, so if the price is going off a cliff for 35% it could hit any percentage more before people stop selling and start buying again

Lemonade is clearly next block priority, I mean who would accept it at 0 conf? Everyone would obviously double spend the fuck outta those kids! Nope, you just gotta pay and hope the next block comes in under an hour

It really isn't acceptable, full mempool or no
Let's pretend I am a miner with a nontrivial amount of hashpower, I want to make more cash than my fellow miners so I create a wallet app, you can make any transaction then my app auto creates another one, it broadcasts a double spend to only myself at x amount more fees that I guarantee will be used if I mine the next block, it costs you nothing for a full refund chance on every purchase
'Trustless' 0 conf is now broken for everyone!

I dont regret buying weed back then, actually I feel lucky to have participated in the early silk road and bitcoin communities which were really special experiences, it's just funny looking back through my old wallet sometimes
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:39:16
If you can accept a check you can accept the risk and historical wait time of 10 sat/byte 0 conf, but you would probably want to have the persons info in case the 'check' was hot
I'm just saying we maybe shouldn't build normal Bitcoin usage around the security model of checks, low risk small stuff like kids lemonade stands are fine though :)

It created an ultimatum date, if you were around before then, segwit activation had been held hostage for years because certain parties wanted a blocksize increase bundled in, like tacking bills together in congress. UASF set the August 1st date, and a couple weeks later S2X came out as a way for miners to save face, of course that failed due to lack of popularity before the 2x portion. 
The 1k+ (reachable) nodes carried enough economic weight to move the debate forward, if you want the truth of it look no further than what is (and isnt) on the majority hashpower chain
And thank you for your contribution!

Thanks for saying this, they love the 'streisand effect' over at the other sub, to the point I wonder how much they post their own anti-BCH memes here just for the publicity (not pointing fingers at OP)
Let BCH die a nothing that no one remembers, treat it like ETH or any other crypto where we don't have a meme on the front page every day. If I was a mod I'd put a sticky on the front page clarifying the difference, ban the anti-memes and be done with it
@_date: 2019-03-16 11:48:16
I don't see how you could break up pools, not that I think it would be a good idea, having a reliable payout helps smaller miners much more than larger ones.
There is good thinking and protocol work to help redistribute power back into smaller miners hands such has Matt Corallo's Better Hash.
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:01:14
NYA conformed to the deadline set out by UASF, the real NYA support levels became apparent when it was unceremoniously canceled before activating the 2x, it was a way for the miners to not appear weak and not much more

If you remember before the fork, several times a decision was put to the network as to what consensus should be run (XT, Classic, Unlimited, etc), and if Bcash had forked after they held a sustained majority hashpower it would be Bitcoin. The fact they forked with a sustained minority hashpower but are still claiming the Bitcoin title is my point. To say it only applies within the same consensus rules is to say any hard fork (even from Core) is no longer Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-16 19:21:26
Is BTC Bitcoin or BCH?


I dont have one, seeing how BTC has more users, thus more hashpower, thus more POW, it seems it is Bitcoin right now


Don't have one, if BCH gains more users, thus more POW, and they started calling it 'Bitcoin', it seems they'd be right


That depends on you, I'm very comfortable with the current consensus rules and the community seems to be too as evidenced by POW. If you wanted to be 110% cautious you would have to wait until the chain dies I guess, its a good thing for you that coins are duplicated on every fork
@_date: 2018-02-16 20:52:14
thanks for the chat ;)
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:48:50
So when Satoshi put the blocksize hard limit in, he knew we had to kill Bitcoin if we wanted to raise it? If core ever hard forks and someone hijacks the old chain Core is no longer Bitcoin?

All you have to do is refer them to the same White Paper they are constantly thumping:


making.** If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone
able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. **The majority
decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested
in it.**
There was a decision put to the network and the network has chosen the current BTC consensus rules as Bitcoin, as represented by POW, and to say BCH is Bitcoin is to deny Satoshi's Whitepaper
All that said I agree with the other posters here, it is generally better to ignore this donkey
@_date: 2018-02-15 00:42:22


Everyone deciding for themselves *is* the hashpower, by deciding they subsidize the chain they use


We can call Roses "Daisies" and then they'd be Daisies all but taxonomically. 
Bitcoin is hard to taxonify but seems to me to have both sprung from the Satoshi genesis block and have the most accumulated POW over time

No, IOU's are a form of debt, no one's channel ever goes into debt with lightning 
@_date: 2018-02-15 00:55:09
Over time the economic activity of users will garner the majority hash power, it is how the system incentives work. How else would you measure the majority of users if not for POW? there is no better indicator
@_date: 2018-02-14 23:52:59
It would need the same genesis block, Doge is Doge. Algorithm is a bit more fuzzy, if we switch from SHA256 I'd say we are still Bitcoin as long as its still POW and not POS or some other nonsense.


then 10% of miners will make an out sized profit on increased fees and rewards until the other miners are no longer financially irrational and the system returns to equilibrium, no one mines for charity
@_date: 2018-02-14 03:45:03


longest chain is only representative of the majority decision, invested POW is a better measure
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:19:41
Great where is the accumulated POW for Bitcoin XY? 
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:44:59
It is ultimately the majority decision that makes something Bitcoin, POW is a lagging indicator of this via fee support, that's why I say 'sustained'
@_date: 2018-02-16 19:05:29
What edge cases? Bitcoin XY has no POW, any implementation that gains a greater POW momentarily will not be able to sustain hashpower because they will hemorrhage money until Moores Law consumes them. How do you propose measuring the protocol usage if not for the money it burns?

@_date: 2018-04-19 23:37:47
Because it provides an outlet for a minority of the crypto community, mostly miners who think additional layers will take away part of their revenue, the technically clueless that insist Bitcoin is a purely economic invention that will continue working as it has without regard for how scaling changes topology, and a few technically proficient that don't understand or care about how those topology changes effect security
edit:also charlatans like the entire Ayres/CSW/Coingeek faction that are taking advantage of the paranoia in that community to build a version of crypto they can patent and profit from

If Satoshi is still alive, I imagine him typing 'shut the fuck up roger' every other day while staring at his monitor for a minute, but then deleting it before signing with his keys and muttering about how he needs to allow bitcoins immune system to develop on its own before heading to the basement and working on his model train set

It's one of the implementations of Bitcoin, currently the largest in use, if you own Bitcoin  at this stage it would be wise to take an interest in the development process, lucky for us Bitcoin is open source and easy to follow!

As much of a scumbag roger is being trying to mislead the noobs, I would implore everyone to not open this can of worms, the last thing we need is a legal definition of Bitcoin that may not comply with a grassroots movements for an improvement or beneficial change at a later date
