I know bro - I’m fucked!!!!
But the writing is on the wall

Crypto is dead �� RIP
@_date: 2018-09-06 04:08:43
I’m committed 
@_date: 2018-09-06 06:50:36
I wanted to buy 1000 BTC for k40$ some 4 years ago, she said she saw on CNN that it was scam terrorist money (Silk Road) and I’ll lose it all, 
I listened to her (like a loser) and here we are chasing a few and separating over her BS,
There will be no 3 rd chance.
Talk to the wall, woman, ugh �� 
@_date: 2018-09-06 05:09:53
I was trying to talk my wife into us investing more now - and she wants to leave me, now I’m fucked.
She doesn’t see that it will go way up in 5 years, she thinks it’s garbage that will go to zero (based on her intuition only)
@_date: 2018-09-06 06:56:34
Thank you Brother, god bless you and your wife.
Keep her close, take nothing for granted.
It is not. Especially around the mid 40’s age.
Midlife crisis will burn your 28 years relationship like a disposable napkin.
Keep her close and happy �� - NEVER mistreat your queen.
Take good care.

I’m committed with what I have
2 years to go, not even sure I’ll move them by than if they didn’t hit the target ��

Hire a subcontractor 
@_date: 2018-09-06 05:07:46
And even in these times, I’m still up, but I’m NOT SELLING!!!!
@_date: 2018-09-08 01:58:40
Get a real job 
@_date: 2018-09-06 06:47:15
I know!!!!
I wish she would listen to me and let me invest stupid fiat into a minimum 5 year plan.
But she is fucking stupid!!!
@_date: 2018-09-06 04:00:24
This shit has been upon us for almost a year

Adoption 
@_date: 2018-08-03 05:15:19
Let’s talk in 3 years
@_date: 2018-08-30 04:48:10
@_date: 2018-10-04 07:26:12
Emerging markets are failing by the dozens around the world, central bankers have outlived their welcome, crypto is destined to rise in adoption (and price) as people flock to it as means of protecting their investments and exchanging value WITHOUT the intermediary who now uses your simple fiat as means of control.
This may take a while (a few years), but it will rise exponentially.
Adoption is already implemented in many distressed economies:  DASH is big in Africa and Asia, NEM is used in Europe, BTC and ETH are globally traded and exchanged.
Blockchain is in its infancy, still in the diapers stage, give it a few years and see how blockchain revolutionizes the way we live.
I remember when the fastest internet connection for homes was a 56k dialup modem, and 10 years later - you could stream HD video on your mobile device.
Technology develop fast, before you know it - BTC will hit 100k TPS, and many other improvements that would make it a viable means of mass adoption.
And crypto currency will do away with central banks and banks in general, they are not needed in the peer to peer system.
Once people can easily spend their crypto like they do fiat today; they will have no problem accepting it as payment, and that puts all the banks (as we know them) to rest.
There will probably be custodial services for crypto (for improved security) but nothing like the current role of the banks and central banks.
People today trust mathematical algorithms more than they trust some greedy fat bankers who keeps robbing them blind and gets rewarded by government bailouts - goes to show who’s in control.
If you are a short term investor - crypto is probably not for you, if you are a long term investor (5-10 years) you are looking at great returns, better than stocks, bonds and other financial products.
@_date: 2018-10-06 18:54:17
Too bad the fees are high
@_date: 2018-10-31 20:04:46
It’s Hal Finney, not Nick Szabo
@_date: 2018-10-26 05:25:07
Good, early education will bring adoption 
@_date: 2018-10-27 03:38:05
Says who?
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:45:23
I grew big balls two years ago 
I got more than you do - I bet.
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:21:32
It’s bad 
@_date: 2018-11-26 07:19:26
No inflation here, there is still a solid known number of bitcoins in circulation (ever made), there will never be more than 21 million- that’s 100% Deflationary.
Current market value is not inflation.
Fiat Quantitative easing is forgery that results in loss of value due to inflation.
@_date: 2018-11-26 07:38:39
Check your financial term definition please 
@_date: 2018-11-25 02:19:08
But nothing to indicate that the network is failing or BTC is dead, it’s only the price action that some people don’t agree with.
I don’t see the end.
@_date: 2018-11-14 03:38:27
If only the link wouldn’t be broken 
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:52:19
Their guess is as good as anyone’s
The real question is if you believe it will disappear or survive?
If it survives - it will rise (as it always does)
@_date: 2018-11-21 23:04:34
They are also an escrow - so your transaction is safe.
@_date: 2018-11-25 23:36:32
Yea I saw one today, it was selling 0.01 BTC for $46 dollars + $3 service fee, when the price was $3750
It’s a theft.
@_date: 2018-11-27 04:56:54
When your city (shitty) hall starts hoarding them - you know something’s up...��
No Lambos or moon (yet), but it’s time to fasten your seatbelts, or is it?

Bitcoin and crypto is disruptive to the biggest most evil industry - the central banks.
It’s not an easy fight and it will take a while, but it will continue to exist and grow over time.
It has always been, currently is and will forever be under attack, but it keeps surviving and growing.
It’s time to fill up the bags.
It’s Black Friday 
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:27:27
If it goes to $1000
I’ll buy a LOT
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:48:00
If I didn’t sell at 20 and 15, I sure am NOT selling for 3.8
@_date: 2018-07-24 01:39:46
Fees are too high
@_date: 2018-12-08 19:23:08
Pay your crypto taxes law, fuck this shit.
It’s time to move to a decentralized exchange 
@_date: 2018-12-02 18:42:52
I’ve been offering discounts to people in my business if they pay with bitcoins or other alts, but no takers to date, nobody knows what it is, and those who do - don’t have any.
I am doing my share in pushing for adoption, but it’s not easy so far.
@_date: 2018-12-31 03:42:39
Fuck roger ver 
@_date: 2018-12-08 00:01:04
Like all of them - prohibitively expensive fees and BS
@_date: 2018-12-08 20:39:23
Who the fuck is using Coinbase to buy?
Use localbitcoins.com and get your BTC instantly 
@_date: 2018-12-17 08:26:09
Yea, we have them in Murica also, only here they are prohibitively too expansive.
The rate is always like 30%+ over the current rate + there are fees (n’ shit).
Not worth it.
What’s the situation down under (mate)?
How’s the rate and fees?
I wish it would be more affordable here...
@_date: 2018-12-02 19:36:12
I do it all the time, but people are deeply indoctrinated in the current system.
@_date: 2018-12-24 03:30:19
Real but also really expensive 
The rate is about $1000 higher than goin rate + there’s fees
@_date: 2018-12-08 22:15:46
And they are an escrow also - so you won’t be scammed 
@_date: 2018-12-08 02:36:38
Got more that a billion sats 
@_date: 2018-12-30 00:24:30
The cheapest would be Coinbase - but it takes time and is reported.
Local bitcoin is an OTC platform, it’s a little bit 5%? More expensive, but it’s quick and not reported
@_date: 2018-12-30 00:12:43
BS, look again, there’s a million guys selling it for cash deposit.
@_date: 2018-12-27 18:12:06
The haters keep announcing the death of BTC, and it keeps living...
Join Nouriel Roubini with his kuskus parties �� 
@_date: 2018-12-23 08:26:21
Legal or not - if it’s accepted it will be traded.
@_date: 2018-12-30 00:03:17
@_date: 2018-12-08 22:17:30
Use OTC platform to buy BTC like localbitcoins.com
And use your BTC as base currency on a decentralized exchange 
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:17:04
Good time to join bro!!!
HODL that bitch until it hits 100X
