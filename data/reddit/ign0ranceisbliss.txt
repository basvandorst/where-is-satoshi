I heard the other day that the new government contracted healthcare website in Oregon(?) has recently had $300m or so of client deposits go missing. They're already calling it a fraud investigation. This happens every day with the US dollar and our own fucking government and no one bats an eye.

Hydrocodone is Schedule III and can be called into the pharmacy by the doctor, unlike oxycodone/morphine.

Do you HAVE to deposit at a BoA location or just into the account?

The silk road gave us a perfect example of a free market and how they function over time. Reputation and feedback drive vendors to provide the best service possible to maintain and grow their customer base.

Fast updates, but it could look a little prettier. Just my two satoshis.

Damn.... Those SilkRoad vendors are pretty well off if they've been saving for a year or two!

I just sent Coinbase support my third complaint email regarding their verification process. I've tried over 15 times now and their damn system won't recognize me as an identifiable US citizen that has not moved in the last 10 years and have never changed my name or SS number. I have never had a problem with Bitinstant or every other site requiring these same verification questions. I am getting EXTREMELY impatient with Coinbase.

I felt like absolute shit over losing a few thousand within six hours! I can't imagine waking up on Monday and realizing that you are an official millionaire in unrealized gains. A day or two later, after starting to cash out a few chunks at a time, the main exchange fucks you in the ass. Your trades are locked up for over an hour, the price is beginning to drop, and you see your potential gains slip away by the second, with nothing you can do about it. Being bit-rich must suck sometimes...

Bitinstant&gt;BTC address&gt;zipzap&gt;Walmart moneygram (blue one)&gt;give cash&gt;receive email notification on the way out the door. I've put in around $1k using this method. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:42:03
Bitinstant forwards you to ZipZap, which in turn gives you the Moneygram info for a cash deposit. I really have no idea where they get the coins from. The last few times I've done a deposit ($500 cash), my coins were in my wallet within 30 seconds. For small amounts, this is much quicker and less stressful than waiting on Gox. 
@_date: 2013-08-01 05:16:40
Yet they still can't fix their horrible verification system for Level 2 account access...

AWWWWWW SHIIIIIIIIEEEET! That mofo got toasted!
That's all, I have nothing more to contribute other than I hope to hell that you are right about the full adoption of Bitcoin. It truly is a revolution in the way that we perceive economic regulation. Now we just need to get everyone else to see it! 
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:47:29
I've felt horrible the last few days knowing that I had over 25k in BTC and spent it on fucking dope. It's even worse now that I'm clean... Things happen for a reason I guess... 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:29:52
Bitcoins are legal... And I highly doubt a middle-aged bank teller will know that your deposit is for buying an online, cryptographic, decentralized currency.

Compared to the average comment section on a large news media/online newspaper site, reddit's users are a bit more educated on the topics they are researching. Yeah, we have our puns, novelty accounts, and guys named SQUID_FUCKER, but overall, the community here puts out some pretty solid conversations. I found reddit around three years ago and I feel that I have learned a lot about a range of subjects. I'm not trying to sound like a hipster know-it-all, but reddit is usually the first place I go (besides Google) when I want to see differing, yet educated opinions on pretty much anything. That's just me though...

BRB, going to find my marbles. They have been missing for some time now...
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:00:07
Yep. I became interested in bitcoin when it was below $5 and watched it climb to $60 before I bought. Discovered the road sometime after and purchased for the first time before the crash in April. Spent my original stash of coins and then went on to buy weekly over the summer while we were around $100. Kicking myself ever since... 
@_date: 2013-08-01 04:01:24
I've checked there for the past three days and they have been out of stock every time. And how in the hell do you advance memberships? My trustcloud thing has a pretty good score and everything else has been verified as far as I know. The fee is ridiculous as a bronze member!
@_date: 2013-03-23 15:58:33
Congrats man! You should throw some tips at your fellow coiners here! You know...... to celebrate! :)

If I were you, those evil little coins would go towards a new chunk of crack.
@_date: 2013-03-30 18:17:44
And once it's down, there is a climb in interest/confidence up to the next wall! And then the next one, and the next one. The cycle will continue. With every day, every bit of media attention and every business acceptance, more coiners will hop on board to join us in this crazy ride towards the future of fiat currency and it's relationship with cryptographic technology.  
@_date: 2013-03-16 16:30:15
Can you confirm that the cash deposit at the bank -&gt; BTC address is working? Also, is the limit still set at $500 cash? I'm looking at placing a $930 order in the next day or two. 
@_date: 2013-04-06 01:11:34
All of the exchanges really need to make it so you can deposit at a bank of your choice. I live in an area with many small, local banks, yet the nearest BoA is 2.5 hours away. I've been fine with the BitInstant-&gt;ZipZap-&gt;BlockChain wallet method, but it's still too unreliable. BitInstant's pay to address function is down 50% of the time and I really don't feel like going through Gox just for a coin or two. 
@_date: 2013-04-30 20:44:16
Heh... A few bricks of ~85% pure MDMA from the road could net him 4-5x his investment if he knew some guys with a distribution system. Then again, with all of the new interest in Bitcoin from big-time enterprises, we could be getting ready for the boom we never thought was possible... along with the inevitable crash lol

Thanks man! I get to go to bed with the warm and fuzzies now just because of you. We bitcoiners are just one big happy family that will stick together through thick and thin :) Until the market crashes and we all go batshit insane. 
@_date: 2013-05-04 19:48:07
Bitinstant is probably the easiest, fastest method of getting coins at this point in time. You don't need to submit information other than an email address or phone number, link a bank account, or wait for verification. The only bad part is the fee, which really should not matter when you are buying under $500 worth. I love walking into my local Wegmans/Walmart, filling out a moneygram and handing the cashier a big wad of cash. When they ask what I'm buying, I fuck with them and respond, "money".
@_date: 2013-04-14 03:58:44
Jesus, you guys need to fuck off with the tulip shit. How can you compare a cryptographic currency, used in international transactions to buy services and goods, to a flower bulb that was considered valuable hundreds of years ago. There is not a set number of tulips in the world. Tulips multiply, leading to a decrease in value and rarity. Tulips are a plant...they occur naturally. The bubble of tulip mania collapsed because someone sat down and thought deeply about the points I made above. That person felt fucking retarded. 
Bitcoin is an idea. It's the first idea of an online, technological, DECENTRALIZED currency for the new age. It separates itself from the most powerful institutions in the world, and does not give a flying fuck what people think. It puts power in hands of individuals, not banks and governments. In the weeks after purchasing my first coins, I felt a sense of independence from the system. I had value at my finger tips, ready to be sent across the earth in a matter of seconds, without fees and other forms of bullshit attached. 
So yeah...flowers and encrypted, online currencies are not as close as you might think.

@_date: 2013-05-02 01:04:46
Um, no. That's not how it works. Bitcoin is valued by simple supply and demand economics. There is a finite number of coins being created at a set rate. If "everybody is a fan" there will be fewer "full" coins for the people wanting to get in. This is where BTC's divisibility shines. It can be processed down nine decimal places, therefore giving value to a one-quadrillionth of a Bitcoin. When the coins are scarce, the price will follow. Why do you think the market crashes when all the panic-sellers start cashing out and rises when the big boys dump money in? Simple economics my friend.
