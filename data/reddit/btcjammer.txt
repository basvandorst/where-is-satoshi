How many loans total has that plan invested in? Just curious - Are you reinvesting as well?
@_date: 2015-12-10 21:45:58
It's our version of doing the two deposits, just a different method. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 18:22:31
If the price rises that much with his plan he'll still be ok as this isnt a BTC denominated plan. He has a number of linked loans so borrowers are protected from volatility. 
That bet would make sense if he kept his investments BTC denominated mostly. This isnt the case. 
@_date: 2015-12-11 03:27:29


Right. 


Yes. 


Yes. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 18:23:47
whats your data source for this?
@_date: 2015-12-10 21:41:27
Coinbase does this much differently then we do. It's not the same thing - they are actively using your bank credentials for buying/selling. This is just a verification for bank account being open. We arent actively keeping this info on file or using it for transactions.  They do a number of things differently around the banking (increasing limits etc).
@_date: 2015-12-10 21:42:55
They actually do a lot more than we do.. They process transactions and keep this info on file - we arent sending/processing any transactions to the bank - it's a login to verify the account and that's it. They do more like increasing limits etc around this as well. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 18:24:48
How long ago was this out of curiosity?
@_date: 2015-12-10 21:50:55
If you dont like it, dont do it. Pretty simple. 
@_date: 2015-12-10 21:26:55
It's a verification to insure that the user has a bank account. We arent keeping information on hand or keeping your credentials. We dont request any permissions or rights in this, just verifying a bank account is active. Hope that gives you a better idea. (also - this is not mandatory for using our services in any way)
@_date: 2015-12-11 20:33:24
I dont disagree with that sentiment. I think Coinbase is providing a quality service to a lot of people. 
@_date: 2015-12-10 21:25:21
Hey there,
For one - this option is not mandatory. It's a similar option we take instead of the deposits you mentioned since we handle a world wide user base. 
We aren't forcing you to give us your credentials, this is just a third party verification for insuring that you do in fact have a bank account. Again, its not mandatory so if you are uncomfortable with it, skip it. 
Hope this helps. 
@_date: 2015-12-10 22:01:53
I understand the sentiment. Again, this is not mandatory - if you think it's invasive and dont wish to provide this information, you dont have to. This isnt a requirement for using our services. We have a lot of quality borrowers who don't do this connection. We understand where you guys are coming from but if this bothers you this much then don't do it. 
@_date: 2015-12-11 00:19:31
Yes. 
@_date: 2015-12-10 21:50:38
Great. For the record we dont possess the ability to make any transactions as you mentioned you'd cancel. This isnt requesting such rights or permissions. If you don't like it, dont do it. I dont think its very complicated. 
@_date: 2015-12-10 22:02:36
@_date: 2015-12-30 20:44:14
We are working hard on the quality of borrowers on the platform. We've looked into AutoInvest data and have also shared it via /statistics page. Good to hear, thanks for the feedback! 
@_date: 2015-12-28 18:23:37
There are linked loans to currencies for this reason. One doesnt have to just invest within BTC denominated loans. We try to offer a few ways to hedge against such movements in price. Just an FYI. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 18:20:07
However, if prices move the other way you get more BTC! It's good to be aware of this for all investors. 
@_date: 2014-10-21 18:22:13
This is exactly what we plan to use the bank verification for. Not only will this provide us with more data to better rate borrowers, but it also will be used by our fraud prevention team to add to their system to look for suspicious or fraudulent activity.

Hi paleh0rse, we have the process of arbitration that is a legally binding contract made possible by a UN treaty that is valid accross more than 140 countries. When a borrower is late on his first payment after 90-days the lenders and the borrowers go through the process of arbitration. The borrower then becomes responsible for the breach of contract.
More importantly, our credit scoring algorithm delivers 19% year over year returns for investors (after a few defaults). As long as you invest in A and B rated borrowers and diversify well, you can have fantastic returns
Learn more about how to do that here:

Hi BTCJam here.
With using our platform you can create your loans set on your own terms, and investors will essentially crowdfund your loan. 
In order to create a loan you must submit a photo ID, proof-of-income, and proof-of-address. We also ask for you to link various social media accounts, Paypal, and/or Ebay. Though your state determined credit score can help, it is not a requirement.
We have many businesses taking out loans on our platform. One user from Argentina, Gaston Azzollini, has taken out a series of loans for his restraunt in Villa Carlos Paz, Argentina. He has posted photos of his restraunt in the user-ran facebook group called "Investors of BTCJam". Feel free to join and ask questions, the investors there would be happy to answer. You can also contact me at support
We have two different types of loans. One tied to bitstamp and the other tied to bitcoin. Learn more here:

Hi daanbarnard, I'm sorry to hear you had a negative experience. I looked at your investment portfolio, and from your one investment of $0.36, we would like to point out that diversification of assets are important to yield positive returns and to mitigate risk as a serious investor. We appreciate your business on BTCJam, please keep in mind that there is risk involved when investing. I would be happy to compensate you for your investment of 0.00094309. Please let me know if you would like this credited to your account.

Hi whols, as stated inthe article, borrowers can select their own interest rates.
@_date: 2014-07-18 00:10:24
Hello Reallybruh,
At BTCJam, we are striving on delivering the best possible returns with low risk to our investors. We do many things to ensure that we are featuring mostly high quality borrowers and are actively trying to filter out the bad apples. 
The first thing we do, is to collect various documents, ebay, paypal accounts, social network informations etc about the borrowers. We verify all those documents and accounts by hand. 
Then we assess the borrower based on his information with our credit scoring algorithm, which assigns every borrower a score ranging from A to E, depending on how likely we think it is that the person will be able to repay investors.
Finally, the ‘wisdom of the crowds’, or really you, our dear investors, decide who gets funded. As you may know from the book with the same title, an individual is usually not very good at making an estimate, but the average from a large group of different people is usually a very accurate estimate. Of course other investors are no guarantee that a borrower will repay, but it is a bit less likely that a large group of people is fooled by someone than just a handful of people. So may want to pay more attention that has many different investors.
If a borrower misses one of his payment for the first time, we try to get in contact with him in various ways. If we get a hold of him and he manages to pay back with a slight delay, we will accept the late payment with a processing fee and return the money to immediately.
If a borrower does not respond to us within 90 days, we start the arbitration process. 
Arbitration is a faster, more efficient, legal alternative to the court system. It is interesting to note that arbitration was the only means of resolving disputes for thousands of years before there were courts. Courts actually embrace arbitration to resolve civil disputes since it reduces the size of court dockets.
Arbitrators are neutral third-parties to whom the parties yield the power to decide the dispute and render an arbitration award similar to a court judgment while avoiding the cost and delays common in court litigation. Arbitration is binding (cannot be appealed) and is recognized and enforced in nearly 150 countries under The United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (1958).
Most importantly, make sure that you diversify your investments as much as possible. Learn more about this here:

Hi amel14, **borrowers do select their own interest rate.** Lenders have nothing to do with the loan creation process. Take a look at our loan creation page as reference:

We are using the same trusted provider as Coinbase to verify your bank account. Also, as stated in the blog post, for improved safety, we intentionally do not store any of your credit card or bank account credentials.
@_date: 2014-05-03 10:56:10
Hi DavidMc0,
BTCJam protects against Bitcoin price volatility by offering linked loans that are tied to the price of USD at the time of activation. See our chart explaining it here: 
@_date: 2014-10-21 21:30:28
We have grown from 1 person staffed (the founder) at that time to 9. Our repayment rate and support are much faster and we have people dedicated to addressing your concerns. Please feel free to e-mail me if you would like to try the improved BTCJam.
@_date: 2015-05-23 01:45:28
They are currently ranging from 9%-13% APR depending on the plan chosen. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 02:09:01
Hi campassi, we have an approximate 90% repayment rate. Investors on BTCJam are currently enjoying 19% APR! We have also recently implemented NAR (Net Annualized Return) for investor's to measure their performance. Read more about NAR here: 
@_date: 2014-10-21 18:36:22
After 90 days of a borrower being late on a payment, the borrower and lenders go through the process of arbitration. Arbitration is a legally binding contract, in which, the investors of the loan receive all of the information of the borrower. Read more about arbitration here: 
@_date: 2015-05-21 18:13:10
Awesome! I think that's great idea and will share this with the team. 
@_date: 2014-11-13 20:49:44
chek2fire, we did experiment with anonymous loans in the beginning of BTCJam back in 2012. We currently require ID verification, address, income. We offer bank and credit card verification, connecting Facebook, Twitter, Localbitcoins, Coinbase wallet, eBay, and Paypal.

Great to hear you've made some gains with us! When it comes to Autoinvest there are different types of plans in which you can invest in only A, B, and C rated loans as you mentioned. If you have any feedback/questions regarding this please reach out to us at support We'd love to hear your feedback on how we can make this tool even better for your investing needs. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 01:44:47
Hi George,
Thanks for that. Once again, it is not our responsibility if your e-mail account was compromised. Please enable two factor authentication for all your accounts. I would also suggest changing your passwords for all your social media profiles, bank account, Apple ID, eBay, etc. as those accounts could have been effected as well.
@_date: 2015-05-21 17:43:00
We have made changes to the interest rates as we updated the model last week. We have heard you guys out about the lack of transparency with the rate changes and plan to communicate better in the future around those. When it comes to these new rates we want to find a great balance for investors and borrowers. We greatly appreciate the feedback around the rates and we are going to continue to work on a balance that is suitable for both parties. 
You can find APR within the Autoinvest feature we released if you were interested. Again, should anyone have feedback or features they would be interested in seeing within our platform please send us an email at support Thanks
@_date: 2015-05-21 18:10:48
Thanks for the feedback! If you have any other features you'd like to see, we'd love to hear your feedback again at support

We have built an innovative credit scoring system to support our peer-to-peer lending platform, the business tier analyses and classifies both our users and their loans, determining their overall non-gaussian risk, using not only historical payment data, but several other independent and not-so-related traits sources.
Our architecture is based on a machine learning system that uses a perceptron-based neural-network that is capable of generating non linear prediction models and classification, directly helping in fraud detection and prevention, decreasing the default rates, and lowering the investors churning.
We keep this transparent on our public stats page on the return on investment chart:

Glad to hear you are enjoying it :) 
@_date: 2015-08-07 17:17:00
Hey good questions!
Earlier this year we brought on a Fraud/Support team to tighten up the verification process. I can't be too specific about the actual activity there but we are constantly working on making it a better process overall. This team has only been in place a few months, but there has been a lot of success in stopping such activity. I think as we continue to get a bigger sample size and more data around this we'll share some information about this underwriting so everyone can get a better idea. 
Yes, you'd have to take our word for it at this time. There are numerous privacy issues with publicly allowing users to vet the borrowers unfortunately. However, you are completely correct when you stress the importance of spreading your loans wide. Eggs in many, many baskets! 
@_date: 2015-08-01 03:02:51
Good suggestions Demotruk! I have seen you around a lot commenting etc &amp; this feedback is great. To answer you comment specifically about borrowers being able to comment. We never take away that ability for them to talk to investors. Our system flags certain actions to prevent fraud and sometimes people get censored for breaking those rules. However, we never hold anyone back from communicating with investors. Drop us an email if you ever think this is happened because we will make sure to correct this if maybe a system got them.
I really like your email idea and I'll be sure to share these with the team. I think that is a good way for investors to stay on top of investments they want to be a part of. Thanks again! 
@_date: 2015-08-01 02:59:26
Another good one. We are going to add a lot to AutoInvest in the future. 
@_date: 2015-08-07 16:59:41
Just for some extra information, this user is in the moderate range for risk. There is another portfolio that is riskier than the ones this investor is in. (A, B, C, D - credit ratings). Added so you are just aware that there are higher risk portfolios.. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 18:16:27
We didn't ignore your email I am actually reviewing the information.  Jeriaska, our system flags your comments for violating the terms of service. 
@_date: 2015-08-26 00:11:43
We have not terminated your account, we have declined your opportunity to borrow. You have complete access to your funds. I understand you're upset by this but what you are mentioning is not true. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 18:12:46
My response is the same as above. We DO NOT prevent any borrower from communicating with investors. Yes, users get blacklisted for many reason (which I will not disclose) but we do not prevent any borrower from speaking to investors. They email support and we make sure it happens. There are many borrowers out there &amp; the fact is if they reach out to us if they are blacklisted we will ALWAYS make sure they are given this ability. 
Im not sure how much better I can state this but we create NO VALUE at all but censoring borrowers. The thought that we do this is simply ridiculous. 
@_date: 2015-08-25 22:16:55
We don't shut down / terminate accounts for any reason, this statement applies to those who are fraudulent and are trying to manipulate the system. That legal wording is there so we are able to move on such accounts correctly and swiftly. 
edit: feedback was noted though! I'll let legal know. Thanks! 
@_date: 2015-07-29 20:15:35
But you havent mentioned how we approach fraud or maybe you haven't used us, I am unsure. We built out a fraud team in March of this year. We are constantly finding ways to underwrite borrowers better. Many of which I'd love to comment here about but that would only give people better ways to manipulate the system itself. 
We screen borrowers heavily and even review loans before they hit the platform to insure that the highest quality on are the marketplace. Defaults will happen, it is part of p2p lending but we do work on improving how we handle fraud.. with AutoInvest we do this more so than ever before. 
@_date: 2015-07-02 21:57:19

Hello all, 
My name is Brett and I work at BTCjam. I was the rep who discussed a lot of this information as stated above. I thought a lot of these suggestions that were given from the user above were very good. It reminded me how important it is to hear you guys out so I think doing these kinds of thing more frequently is going to be a goal of mine in the future. A lot of these ideas were really good ones and I thank you all for sharing input in the discussion. 
One note about the edit made above. When doing 2FA, this is supposed to be done on a different device. When entering the codes on the web, you should read them from mobile. When needed to enter on mobile, one should also take this from web or another device entirely. That is the reason tfa really exists and taking it from one device entirely could cause friction with the timing allocated from authentication apps. Just a heads up :)
@_date: 2015-08-01 02:58:04
Yes, we have some work in the UI. We're planning on doing some overhaul on that very soon. Notes like you mentioned needs some work as well. Really good feedback, thanks for sharing this! I really liked the one you said about payments having to dig. Those should be a little clearer and upfront as they are important! Thanks again!

I'll have a look into the OTC issue, was honestly unaware of this. 
I don't know much about BitRated but I will look into them. It's going to be interesting watching the reputation based services come up as I think this stuff will become more important over time. I'll have a look into it, thanks for the suggestion. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 18:47:36
We have tried repeatedly to contact you regarding your issues with our company. Our CEO even took some time to respond to you on Facebook about your frustrations. It's been over a half a year since youve invested in any borrowers and a lot has changed since then. We have built out a support team (heavily requested) as well as a fraud team (heavily requested) in March of this year. Autoinvest was another product we released that our users requested. We listen to our users daily about their wants and needs on our platform.

How long ago was this just our of curiosity? We have changed a lot as a company over the past. We ask users to diversify because many who do have great results using the platform. Eggs in many baskets is a good investment strategy not just with cryptolending but universally with different investment strategies. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 23:20:46
This is good feedback. We actually have plans to update those awards with more information about how to use them and best practices. We are working on it :) Great feedback!
@_date: 2015-07-02 21:59:19
Truthfully, I have no idea how that figure came to be. That was a call made by the judge I believe. I'd imagine interest + volatility (changes in the price of BTC) are in the mix but I truthfully have no idea. I'm sure you thought about those things already but I have no seen any details from the case to properly answer this for you. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 19:46:02
We also released some info about AutoInvest today ^^.

@_date: 2015-07-29 19:07:41
We actually brought on a fraud/support team here at BTCjam in March of this year to work on these very issues. We have tightened up fraud checks and inspection of borrowers. To answer your statement this is something that we are very passionate about improving as a company. Given the amount of statistics thrown out here about us (which are false statistics) I think we will work to be more transparent about such data for investors and borrowers alike. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 23:18:27
Internationally we operate in countries that do not have accessible credit systems let alone credit reports. Tricky thing to do given those circumstances but we are indeed looking for ways to integrate such policies currently.

There are many users who have had success with arbitration so far, but I understand your concerns. We have grown a lot over a year and recently brought on a fraud and support team to work on these areas in March of this year. We have bulked up on the verification process as well as verifications heavily. We now screen loans in review process as well to insure that loans are of higher quality then you may have seen over that period of time. We are fully committed to working on these areas, and it is a hard mission, but I would love to get more feedback regarding your experience over that time if you'd be willing to shoot us an email to support Thanks @_date: 2015-07-02 22:46:51
All good suggestions. Yes, Im working on getting more information together in these areas. I think education as you mentioned is good for everyone with regards to these subjects. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 23:32:08
That is the reason we created our own credit reporting system, to be able to serve those who unfortunately do not have access to traditional credit. It's ambitious, even more so with BTC :)
@_date: 2015-07-02 22:51:47
Good suggestions as well. I'll give these to the group today. 
We do promote btcjam.uservoice.com quite a bit within the fb groups but I'll try to be more vocal about that. Emailing w features is also a good idea I share these with the group often should you post in uservoice as well, that is fine as we look at it.

Forum: a majority of our users are using AutoInvest these days which usually is a set it and forget it type of user. With that being said we don't have plans for a forum but there are active spaces in facebook where groups openly talk about issues that arise. If you want some links to these groups let me know I'd be more than happy to provide some so you can get involved. Many power users are there and I do chat there as well with them about these things. 
Censorship is more around protecting users and liabilities. We have to protect users information. However, if you have any ideas about ways to improve this let me know. I'm open to hearing more about how it would be helpful for investors in certain situations etc. Good questions! 
@_date: 2015-07-29 19:15:48
We actually have a handful of lenders who use the arbitration awards with success. Of course, there are different strategies for this but it has been effective from those I have chatted with. I don't think your ideas are bad at all when it comes to higher loan amounts. Recently we have had some very big loans hit the platform and we are working to see what we could potentially do in the future around this. 
If you come across any services you think might work shoot us an email at support - We're always willing to see how we might be able to strengthen the lending experience. 
@_date: 2015-07-27 19:09:20
Thanks so much! We'll be sure to get back to you shortly!

Our credit rating system actually has hundreds of variables which contribute to credit scores, not simply paying back. Just paying back loans does not mean a rating will go up. 
Specifically with D rated borrowers we have just created credit limits (released this week) for these borrowers and are always adjusting criteria for rating with all of our borrowers. With p2p lending you are going to have some different ratings which also carry different risk but we are always reevaluating these borrowers. Hope this gives you a little more info!

One thing to note here is that we serve borrowers internationally throughout the world.. Many of which are just hearing about Bitcoin for the first time as they come to BTCjam. We spend a lot of time providing knowledge and tools for these borrowers but they are many times still quite taken back by how comprehensive BTC can be. I work with borrowers in nations that cannot buy Bitcoins on the great exchanges that we have in developed countries as they are unable to use their local currencies to buy BTC. LBC will also have very limited amount of sellers in such countries and many of those countries do not have credit to begin with at all. 
We'd love to institute something such as this but at this time &amp; where Bitcoin is in growth/history, it's not so easy when you consider such people. Since we are all BTC advocates we tend to forget how difficult it could be for someone internationally to go through such hoops. We are aware of these things, but many of us are truthfully earlier adopters. Hopefully as Bitcoin and services around Bitcoin grow, we can work to integrate things like this. I hope this gives a little background about some of the challenges we face day to day.

Hey Jeriaska, 
We do not prevent any borrower from communicating with investors. Blacklisting happens for many reasons, of which I cannot disclose to protect manipulation. We create no value by censoring borrowers &amp; overlook these situations to correct them when this happens. I'm sorry if you felt this was the case. We recently added a admin account who overlooks the threads &amp; comments and please reach out to this user  Support if you think this is the case. 
@_date: 2015-08-07 16:57:41
Thanks for sharing this information. As a team, we think this is amazing and we are glad you are having a good experience with AutoInvest. 
@_date: 2015-07-02 22:03:24
Something we are planning on fixing soon... Given the scenario, you'd have 36 days. Why? We don't exactly think that it is fair to punish borrowers with a payment in 6 days.. However, those who abuse this system are dealt with accordingly in case you were wondering. 
@_date: 2015-07-10 20:50:36
Should have been more clear. I was just stating that even BitGive was being hit with this. I got your PM I'm going to have the account corrected. 
@_date: 2015-07-30 22:52:39
Hey (tagging as well)
I took a look into your plan. It was actually not one that was reflected in the data we ran. We considered plans that had diversified over 100 investments. Your plan was one that diversified in only 50 plans / 0.02 invested per loan / 1 BTC. 
Below I've included the link where this % was originally posted. This is for AutoInvest plans that were diversified into 100 investments. 1 BTC - 100 loans - 0.01 as an investment in each. The correct net return is 18%, for investors with more than 80 investments on their plans. That means, removing the expected defaults (for users that missed payments) investors that are using AutoInvest in it's full potential are getting 18% returns.
 
You'll probably ask why we didn't include that data and this is a fair question... Since we released AutoInvest we ran data on our most heavily used plans to provide anaylsis that included a solid sample size. The plan you have was simply not as common. Having looked over all of this &amp; chatting with you all yesterday we definitely learned a lot. We're going to try to make sure we are more transparent in the way that we share data and information in the future. This feedback has been good to hear and I truthfully appreciate you taking the time to send this over to us so we could look into what happened. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 20:38:05
Hey - this is a good suggestion. We actually are monitoring the development at OneName and we hope to use services like these as they come up around the industry. We're seeing more reputation based services as well spring up so it will be great as these companies gain more traction and usage. Thanks for the input though, it is great to hear!
@_date: 2015-07-29 23:08:09
How about adding this one to your edits?
@_date: 2015-07-08 23:59:57
FYI, I responded to this below.. Have a look when you get a moment. 
@_date: 2015-07-02 22:56:10
I'll have a look into it and share it with the team. We are always looking for things to build upon verification etc.. Thanks for sharing.. I don't remember getting the email but send it back over if you would (attn brett would be great). Thanks !

Identity is the responsibility of the person and if he/she believes it was stolen, they must take the steps to report that through official channels. In this specific case we have strong confirmatory documentation. Some defaulters generally don’t own up and I double checked with our back office and the ID and account holder do match. We cant control what someone says after the fact. We have responded to this inquiry through our support channels. 
@_date: 2015-07-03 01:02:50
We have the NetARB process in tact which is being used to collect defaulted loans. In terms of what we are doing is pretty much supplying those binding agreements to investors who are then able to pursue judgements etc.. As I mentioned elsewhere we are constantly looking for ways to better this process. 
In terms of history, I have only been at the company a few months and I can share with you my knowledge since. We have bulked up on the verification and fraud process. We now do multiple screenings for users when they get verified and when they post loans. We've learned a lot from the times that you speak about we have worked on preventing scams quite a bit. We've updated the amount of loans one can have active within the marketplace and we are reviewing borrowers frequently for suspicious activity. We plan to be transparent about these changes as well with data so that investors can see the differences being made. 
@_date: 2015-07-30 00:54:20
Incase you missed this response. 
Hey Thanks for the feedback and for using BTCjam. I PM'd you with an email of ours so that we can look into your case more. When it comes to credit rating changes this is something that does happen on our platform. We implement new data into the model all the time and ratings are subject to change. Just like any other financial institution interest rates and credit ratings change all the time, we are no different there. However, if we dropped the ball in getting back to you I sincerely apologize. We try to make sure we satisfy all users requests and communicate until all cases are resolved. It'd be greatly appreciated if you drop me a note via email so I can make sure we don't leave you hanging.
Thanks again for the feedback.
@_date: 2015-07-27 18:29:03
Hey Thanks for creating a loan request with us here at BTCjam. Could you shoot us an email to support with your username so we can see what we can do about verifications since you are located in Bulgaria? I know sometimes the verifications can be tricky for international users but we'd be more than happy to have a look and see what we might be able to do to help out. Thanks again!

Thanks for the kinds words :)  We got a lot of negativity about support around this time a year ago and made big efforts to strengthen that area. Always good to hear this feedback! 
@_date: 2015-07-02 22:01:48
We see the general page for your LocalBitcoins account. We use this to see if a borrower is really trading on LBC or not. You want a 50 BTC loan for LBC trading but don't have a profile... I think you get the point here. All basic info. 
@_date: 2015-07-02 23:31:23
2 days. If the info submitted is quality and checks through with compliance thats around 24 hours. Loan review is around 24 hours as well hence where I came up with that figure where the loan would be listed on the marketplace. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 18:55:47
Hey We have two types of loans here at BTCjam. We have linked loans and non linked loans. Linked are loans that are tied to USD and other fiat denominations. If there are price swings the borrower is always tied to the fiat amount so that they are protected against volatility. BTC only loans are less frequent as many of our borrowers are aware of such terms. We also try to educate borrowers about these differences so that they are aware of such risks before loans hit the platform. Hope this helps give you a better idea. Let me know if you have any more questions :)
@_date: 2015-07-30 17:31:38
Hey I asked you below for your username to see what was going on with the investments you reported. Can you send us some details so we can look into this? Your comment seems to be gone now.
@_date: 2015-07-02 23:00:51
A &amp; B are funding incredibly quick. Since the launch of AutoInvest A + B loans are funding at a pace that is pretty incredible. I saw 2 or 3 last week that went in about a half hour. We are thinking about tinkering around with this so that those who manually invest as well will have some opportunities at these loans as well. Hope that helps out. Using the follow option is a good way to get notified about users posting a listing etc when it hits the marketplace. Hope this helps. 
@_date: 2015-07-31 20:23:35


This is really an interesting case of using the Notes section I don't think many investors are too aware of. Thanks for sharing this.

Hey Thanks for the inquiry about BTCjam. Below I've included the link where this % was originally posted. This is for AutoInvest plans that were diversified into 100 investments. 1 BTC - 100 loans - 0.01 as an investment in each. The correct net return is 18%, for investors with more than 80 investments on their plans. That means, removing the expected defaults (for users that missed payments) investors that are using AutoInvest in it's full potential are getting 18% returns.
 
The actual referenced user who wrote in about having a negative return using AutoInvest actually had a different plan than the one we wrote about here. That user only diversified in 50 plans. He has 1 BTC - 50 investments - 0.02 / investment. 
Hope this helps and please let me know if you have any questions about this service or BTCjam. Thanks! 
@_date: 2015-09-30 21:38:33
Those who usually take these loans are those who are crypto loving people or those who get paid in BTC usually. Of course I cannot confirm every borrower in these categories but to give you some idea.. 
@_date: 2015-09-15 20:30:01
1. From our research this seems to be a third party email db leak from many btc companies, some have been mentioned in this thread. 
2. You can always check the DKIM signature and see that this is not ours. 
3. We did NOT have anything compromised. 
@_date: 2015-09-30 21:34:54
True. We are trying to establish credit for those internationally who dont have such great access to capital/credit
@_date: 2015-09-30 21:36:35
Just a note, they are only servicing those domestically in the US. No BTC :(
@_date: 2015-09-30 21:45:59
Agreed, the stats here are also not correctly marked. He's considering his late marks, not actual defaults. With AutoInvest you'd have to let it play out as well to really know.
@_date: 2015-09-15 21:05:15
Never would we do such a thing. 
@_date: 2015-09-30 21:41:59
Yes, we are pretty restrictive of who gets a loan from us right now - These documents are critical as investors rely on us to do a good job of vetting borrowers. 
@_date: 2015-09-30 21:24:56
Still going strong?!?!?! I dont think this borrower let AI play out - It's hard to tell given the pictures he sent they dont give us a good idea of the whole story. 
@_date: 2015-09-30 21:18:18
We're working on that pretty hard right now, being a lot more selective with loans and those we let onto the marketplace. 
@_date: 2015-09-30 21:37:21
check my response ^^
@_date: 2015-09-30 21:48:14
Using Autoinvest? Can you send us some details so we can check this out? Thanks!
@_date: 2015-09-30 21:20:26
You also have quite a bit in receivables - I think it would make more sense to let that play out and report on it later - send us the info and we can look it over. Thanks
@_date: 2015-09-15 21:06:06
Yes, that would be the messaging as you havent confirmed the last change for the withdraw address. It's there to insure that withdraw address confirmation emails are accepted. The last one was not confirmed, therefore you get that messaging.
@_date: 2015-09-30 21:41:18
40% under what term for the loan? What rating are you?
@_date: 2015-09-30 21:17:42
Hey Can you please send us over your Alias so we can look into this? Would also like to know your AutoInvest plan as well so that we can have a look and see what happened. 
If you send us some info - we can have a look and give some details of what is going on. Thanks for sharing. 
PS: Not sure of the conditions / terms of the AI but you'd most likely know a lot more down the line than you would in 2 months. Given that terms are longer and you have BTC in pending receivables yet to be paid, might be worth seeing how this pans out. 
Send us some info and we'll gladly report back about this &amp; let you know what we saw. Thanks
@_date: 2015-09-30 21:30:11
Hey Thanks for reaching out to us about this - Happy to hear that you are profitable and enjoying the service. I'll try my best to explain what is going on with the marketplace and would love to hear some feedback -- 
For one, we are working to bring quality borrowers to investors. We are vetting borrowers much harder than we ever have as a business before. So yes, we are upping the security of who get to the marketplace. With tools like AutoInvest now running and funding loans quickly - we decided that this is really important. Right now we are accepting around ~10% of the loans sent to us daily if that gives you a better idea of how selective we are being. 
Few things which contribute to this marketplace size as well I'd like to comment on.. 
1. Loans are funding quicker than ever before. We have loans daily that get funded within minutes. Quality borrowers that have been around for some time get decently large loans funded in record time. Lot of manual investors who are hawking these listings getting ready to 
2. AutoInvest is helping funding quite a bit as well.  Lots of guys signed up and are using AI which is really nice. Lot of investors liquidity in the marketplace right now. Put that together with our whales who throw a bit more BTC than the casual investor and listing is funded.
3. Competitive marketplace - Since loans are going so quick, investors don't want to miss out. You can easily understand the effect here - loans go live and its funded really quick. More reason why we have to be selective with our review and pushing borrowers to the marketplace more so than ever. 
Hope this gives you some insight to what is going on -  Appreciate the questions / Ask away if you have some more. 
If you know someone who is looking for some capital - I dont think there is a better time to send him over our way. Use that referral code though!
@_date: 2015-09-30 21:45:06
I understand your concern here completely and don't think you are wrong in anyway for your stance. However, free market rates are very hard to build a business around. We have a mission to provide those internationally and in developing markets with the ability to acquire credit at an affordable rate. Free markets and interest rates make it very hard to judge whether or not we are competitive is such spaces. In theory it is very nice, when it comes to business and providing competitive rates it is a very hard thing to accomplish. 
We werent trying to be more like traditional markets in anyway, we just want to make sure we are doing what we set out to accomplish. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 02:52:01
 - Check the very bottom here, you'll see some visual data for this. I don't have exact  in front of me right now but that gives you a pretty good idea. Hope that helps, sorry I dont have the data on hand. 
@_date: 2015-09-30 21:33:22
Interest rates are dependent on the borrower rating, not every borrower pays that. There are many different allocations for AutoInvest plans etc. Good borrowers at good ratings, rates can get low ~2%
Let me know if you want more information! Check the info I responded to as well about the state of the marketplace. Might be no better time than to try and get a loan with us now. Lots of liquidity and fast funding!
@_date: 2015-09-30 21:19:50
Yes, these statistics are inaccurately reported, thanks for pointing that out. Sorry you got down-voted about this :) 
@_date: 2015-09-01 22:21:43
Thanks for touching base about this. This would be cumulative of all lending &gt;$3K. Let me know if there are any more questions regarding this! 
@_date: 2015-09-30 21:40:16
Interest rates are generally better for borrowers in the longer term. One reason you see more of this happen. Im glad you are thinking about that in your strategy, its a key concept! 
@_date: 2015-09-30 21:46:27
AutoInvest or manual investing?
@_date: 2015-09-30 21:23:47
Thanks for the feedback -- We honestly havent gotten much feedback about the statistics that would be helpful on the loan pages for investors - I'll shoot this over to the dev team so we can think more about what might be helpful for you guys. 
We know the statistics need an overhaul and we are planning on getting the done in the future. PM me your alias so I can have a look at your investments and give you some feedback etc. Thanks for taking the time to share this info
@_date: 2015-09-30 21:31:46
He did but he didnt report these statistics accurately - he doesnt have that high of a default rate. Quite frankly, he just began AutoInvest and wouldnt really know the actual impact for some more time. Not being able to see his allocated profile and risk associated, I cannot really provide more info -- what I have seen was hard to tell anything really. 
If i get the info I'll be happy to report what was going on
@_date: 2015-09-09 23:37:59
Good to know you want more out of AutoInvest. We are working on building some filters and more detailed touches for future releases. Thanks for the input. Drop us an email with your username so we can look into the plan and maybe offer some suggestions. 
@_date: 2015-09-30 21:32:11
AutoInvest or Manually investing? Just curious! Drop me a PM if youd like us to look into it
@_date: 2015-09-15 20:18:15
That messaging is triggered from you actually having tried to process a withdraw address change. Not SPAM email. 
@_date: 2015-11-23 19:50:17
This is true for developed countries with easy access to capital, you are definitely correct. We try to help out borrowers in developing countries who might be saving a ton on interest rates where their native banks are charging 300%/yr. Might not be a great rate for you if you live in the US but for someone in Brazil they'll be saving a lot. 
Thanks for the feedback! 
@_date: 2015-09-30 21:35:58
Neither are true. The i% are not dependent on the default rate. i% are dependent on the credit score of the borrower solely. 
I dont think we'd have so many investors at a 50% default rate - that is pretty high! 
@_date: 2015-11-23 19:52:53
- Thanks for the feedback. We've been working pretty hard on the underwriting for borrowers and hope to have more announcements about that in the future. We're also working on getting more high quality borrowers for the marketplace - we want to make those coins move a bit quicker
@_date: 2015-11-24 01:50:20
I hope so! 
@_date: 2015-09-30 21:38:52
Miners as well as those paid in BTC
@_date: 2015-11-23 19:55:48
That was a long time ago for us. We've grown a bit since then &amp; have made a lot of changes. If you come back let us know if you recognize any &amp; give us some feedback. 
Manual investing is really hard, but we released AutoInvest to do this work for you. It's a mighty tool which is working out well and we highly recommend it. 
@_date: 2015-10-01 00:23:31
We've made aggressive steps to stop the build you are talking about. We are working on getting tougher with verifications and accurate measures of a borrowers capability to pay back. Over time, we've made a lot of changes in this area and hope to make many more.  
@_date: 2015-10-01 00:14:18
Awesome, you've brought us some good borrowers as well. Thanks for doing that and really happy to hear about your experience. Thanks for the info!
@_date: 2015-11-18 18:58:22
What is your alias so we can look into this? Thanks
@_date: 2015-11-23 19:59:24
Not a bad gain. How long were you using us before that? Just curious - we've made a lot of changes since the possible timing of you leaving. 
@_date: 2015-10-02 19:45:22
We do check against identity theft when it is reported. The user you brought up never reported it. We made this very clear to you multiple times. 
If we engaged in censorship, we wouldn't have taken the time to respond to your many comments online, through support, email and even in our facebook groups. 
We dont create a valuable business with your claims and our users are aware of this. You've been on this single tirade for months and we're done commenting. 
@_date: 2015-10-01 00:26:39
Yes, we encourage 100+ investments, that is the true point of AutoInvest. This is a very small sample size where risk will be much higher. On our blog we wrote about this - plans with 80+ investments were doing much better than those who were not. 
@_date: 2015-10-01 00:28:47
BLC lending is international which makes this very very difficult to do given legal restrictions and requirements. Lending club is strictly domestic and if you learn about their legal framework then you will see why they are able to do such a thing. It's something I think all companies want at the end of the day btc or not, however these companies arent operating internationally and have a few more years on them to get to this place. 
Not trying to push btc lending down your throat, it surely isnt for everyone just trying to give some background.
@_date: 2015-10-01 00:25:16
Same applies with us in the BTC lending world. Nothing really different with the strategy that you mention. Just the BTC 
@_date: 2015-10-01 00:24:30
How do you know we dont invest our own BTC?!?!?!!?! 
@_date: 2015-10-01 00:18:33
Agreed, we are anything but a ponzi scheme we dont take money down to get returns, we are an investment platform / p2p lending. 
@_date: 2015-10-01 00:04:23
Cant say for certain that these are lower risk. We analyze these rates frequently, many times longer terms carry lower interest given that borrowers are able to cover these loans easier. Spreading the payments throughout longer terms is something that many borrowers asked about as well and wanted. Hope this helps
@_date: 2015-11-11 18:20:33
Thanks for sharing your experience with us. Currency denominated loans are a great investment on the site when you think the price will go down. We are seeing more users like you talk about price strategies which is awesome! 
We are working really hard to bring high quality borrowers to the platform and are thankful that your experience is reflecting this. Diversification is really key for avoiding the risk we account for in the model. We still have a lot of work to do but thanks for giving us some feedback. 
@_date: 2015-10-01 00:31:33
5 People really isnt that great of diversification, so yes that is true for what we recommend. Those who are investing in 100+ borrowers are doing quite well given that we take the risk into account when investments are spread as such.
@_date: 2015-10-01 00:34:37
Patience is actually one of the best characteristics we see in positive investors so I am glad that you are doing this. Thanks for the feedback, we are working hard on getting more quality borrowers your way.
Also, do you use the follow feature to get updated about borrowers that you used before? Lot of guys using this are enjoying it. 
@_date: 2015-10-02 17:50:07
You've violated numerous terms with your comments &amp; harassment of users. We cannot be liable for identity theft if the identity theft has not been reported - which we actually check against to make sure this doesn't happen. You're censored because you violate our TOS. You haven't invested with us in months but come on the platform to harass users. Plain and simple we don't endorse this activity. 
@_date: 2015-10-01 19:13:13
Not sure if you have an open case or not, but we run through hundreds of emails a day for users. We try to cover everywhere, sorry if you didnt hear back. Drop me a PM with a case number and I'll see what I can do. 
@_date: 2015-10-01 00:36:18
These stats are wildly inaccurate. 
@_date: 2015-11-23 19:54:22
Depends on what terms you were invested in. There are many options for denominated loans tied to borrowers local currencies and when the price moves this can have some different outcomes as well. If you purely invested in BTC loans though, that analysis would be correct. 
@_date: 2015-10-01 17:20:41
Youve violated our terms of service numerous times &amp; I've personally commented about this a few times. I get your on a mission but I've given you a response in many different areas and I've got no further comment that would ever satisfy you. 
@_date: 2015-10-01 00:16:50
Yes, we have a TOS which youve frequently violated and we've responded to these accusations numerous times. Thanks
@_date: 2015-10-01 17:18:30
What country do you happen to be from if you dont mind me asking?
@_date: 2015-10-01 00:07:11
These technically are no longer anonymous lenders, we do verification on borrowers now as well as review of loans. We've moved away from the anon lending practice we had some years ago. 
@_date: 2015-11-23 20:01:58
Can you shoot me over your Alias via PM? Just want to look into some of the guys who you are speaking about. 
We are working hard on gaining some of those services (pooling investors) right now. Cant say much as we are testing many things but thanks for sharing this feedback.
