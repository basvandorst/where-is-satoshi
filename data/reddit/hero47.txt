was it difficult to cash out what I suspect is a ridiculous amount of money?
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:21:57
34 now. Fucking hell...

As I said, it's _around the corner_. We'll see what POS will spell for Ethereum this year.

Proof of Stake is around the corner. *don't shoot the messenger*

Excelent analysis

@_date: 2017-08-29 17:50:37
Damn. I missed such an obvious fact. Makes perfect sense.
@_date: 2017-08-24 22:41:11
How come?
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:30:27
To Europa! (~~Saturn~~ Jupiter moon)

What is the accidental part of all this?
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:50:42
Bitcoin will become a global currency and will erode the Nation State concept and nationalism. World peace and stability will follow. We'll all become citizens of the United States of Earth.

400K per coin doesn't seem impossible.

Bitcoin crashes, you all altcoin bitches crash
@_date: 2017-08-31 10:25:46
Because it has yet to achieve mainstream level of adoption.  
Like paying for coffee or going to the movies using bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 13:31:29

This is a revolution, not just another stock.  
Or it could be a bubble. Who can tell...

Time in the market beats timing the market. Dollar cost average your way in
@_date: 2017-09-02 08:23:39
So you're saying there's a chance
@_date: 2017-09-13 18:10:17
