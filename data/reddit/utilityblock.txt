What percentage of people do you think are risking their money sitting on BTC instead of USD? And do you think the majority treats BTC as a speculative investment or as a currency?
I know some venezuelans that have some money invested in BTC and alts and they treat it as a risky speculative investment. They are logically more averse to risk since as you said every penny counts.

The problem is not that simple. Major exchanges also do this, using tx fee as an excuse instead of being clear and stating that they charge high withdrawal fees.

Use for what it is good at? You are not using a store of value, you are speculating it will be a good store of value. BTC right now is not a good store of value, but a speculative asset. A good SoV maintains its value compared to goods, BTC yearly price swings are the complete opposite.

But weren't they gonna assume the loss and leave customers unaffected? I don't understand this conspiration.
