Again there is a clear distinction.  In today's world internet access is a fundamental necessity and, despite what ISPs would tell you, a basic commodity (i.e. the ability to transmit a specific number of 0s and 1s over a given period of time) provided by core infrastructure with a high barrier to entry meaning there are limited players in a de facto closed market resistant to the fundamental principals of supply and demand.  Because of this ISPs should be viewed as [common carriers]( without the ability to discriminate in any way based upon the content of that being delivered.  This means that any content restrictions, rather than being imposed arbitrarily by private companies many of which operating at monopoly or near monopoly status with little or no recourse available to consumers, would instead have to come from a government accountable to its constitution (including the first amendment), the rule of law, and the will of the voters.  This also provides ISPs the benefit that they are not liable for any content that might be transmitted over their networks.  This is the exact same set of rules under which most utilities and transportation services currently operate and are specifically designed to prevent discrimination, censorship, and price gouging.
Internet based services such as social media, payment platforms, forums, and the like are not basic necessities, are specific, unique, and diverse, and have a generally low barrier to entry suggesting a thriving market more in line with the law of supply and demand. This means that these companies are not common carriers and are free to operate under any service contracts or terms of service they choose provided that they don't violate local laws or discriminate based on any of the intrinsic human characteristics outlined above.  These businesses, just like any other, can be held liable if they knowingly allow dangerous and/or unlawful activities to be committed through the use of resources under their control.

There is nothing hypocritical about that.  The bakery is denying services based on sexual orientation, which, like race or gender are intrinsic human qualities that have no bearing on ones character.  This is why discrimination based on those qualities is  rightfully prohibited.  Every good citizen deserves to enjoy the benefits of living in an interdependent society which includes purchasing products or services from a publicly sanctioned business.
Spewing out lies and hate is a conscious decision.  It is not an intrinsic human quality.  Even so. nobody is denying anybody their right to say whatever they choose, however, nobody owes them a platform from which do do so.  Alex Jones can say whatever ignorant, vile thing he wants to say.  He can create his own website or yell it on a street corner all he wants.  These companies have just chosen to not allow him to use their resources to spread his reprehensible ideas.  
There is no censorship.  There is no hypocrisy.

It's remarkably easy to adjust.  I've set Mycellium to bits (μBTC) and it works just fine.  You quickly learn the conversion is ~2000 bits/dollar and the transaction fee is 100 bits.  It really is much more intuitive that using long decimals or millibitcoin.  People seem to think that dollar/euro/pound parity should be the goal but it is actually much easier and more intuitive when you can deal mainly in whole numbers, even large ones.

@_date: 2014-05-05 00:22:55
You are correct in that they haven't specifically stated so but the nature of the Bitcoin protocol makes it a de facto reality.  For example, you acquire 100,000 bits each in 3 separate transactions at different times and cost bases each to a unique public address but to the same wallet.  You then transfer all 300,000 bits to a new wallet using a single transaction.  You then sell 50,000 bits at a price lower than the last acquisition but higher than the first.  You can directly associate either input to the sale and claim either a loss or a gain depending on whichever suits your needs better.  Since bitcoin is perfectly fungible in this manner, it does not matter that the blockchain inputs directly match the sale because one input is not qualitatively distinguishable from another.  So long as you accurately report your transactions, no IRS auditor will require specific input matching.  It is only if there appears to be some discrepancy that they will begin analyzing the blockchain for any misrepresentation or inconsistencies.
@_date: 2014-05-05 03:13:51
You can prove that but the IRS cannot prove definitively that a trade or sale was linked to a specific input.  This fact alone means that there is no practical guideline they can institute requiring reporting on that basis because it cannot be consistently enforced.
Additionally, consider the fact that requiring specific input matching would require tremendous resources on the part of the IRS to [attempt to] track and enforce without generating any additional revenue over the standard reporting I have outlined.  In other words over time all gains are captured regardless and at basically the same tax rates as they would have been using the more complicated method.  
The IRS can definitely be draconian and nit-picky but generally will do so only in cases where the cost of enforcement is significantly less than the uncaptured revenues in play.  This is not true in this circumstance.

You are correct in that the network effect doesn't work when describing marketshare for a product.  Sometimes it can be used to explain first mover advantage for certain services (Facebook being a prime example) however this is still an incorrect usage of the term.
The thing is Bitcoin is neither a product or service. It is a protocol which is where the network effect can be properly applied.  Because products and services are built upon protocols they tend to become standard even when better/more functional options become available.  For years there have been superior alternatives to DNS, SMTP, HTTP, and numerous other protocols used by millions on a daily basis yet their is no serious discussion about replacing any of them.  Even IPv4 which is being replaced out of sheer necessity still has a nearly unshakable foothold to the point that administrators will go to incredible lengths to avoid upgrading their networks to function with IPv6.

But you are keeping track of everything that matters from the perspective of the IRS.  You are recording and reporting every single trade and transaction, their date, and value.  
Again, inputs are not serial numbers and cannot be used as such., The simple fact that bitcoin is fungible means that in many, if not most cases, it becomes literally impossible to say a specific unit of bitcoin came directly from a specific input just a couple of transactions later.  The most you can say for sure is that the transactions are related.  This is an easily demonstrable quality of the bitcoin protocol therefore no guideline requiring specific input matching could ever be enforced.

Definitely!  It is good to see a major player such as yourself embrace μBTC as the default display unit.  Hopefully other important sites and services such as wallets, exchanges, Coinbase, bitcoinity, etc, will follow your lead.
Though there is a small but vocal opposition to the word bit, it has similar advantages linguistically as μBTC does technically. I'm all but certain now that the cat is out of the bag, its use will grow organically and it will soon become the de facto standard.  Your leadership in this matter could go a long way towards hastening the process.  
I currently use the Bitpay plugin for Zencart and I would love to see the prices at checkout listed as so:
**92200 bits (μBTC)**
This looks so much better than the current:
**0.0922 BTC**
Eventually, the "(μBTC)" could be dropped as the word "bit" becomes widely adopted.
@_date: 2014-05-03 02:32:35
By inverting the exchange rates, it would also make it much more approachable.  Instead of saying 1 BTC = $450 you could say $1 = 2200 bits.  Maybe if we ask nicely, could make this an option, or even the default, on [bitcoinity](

A website used to generate private keys does not (or at least should not) have any information on those who use the site to do so.  The most one can do is inform them that they are using a flawed random number generator.  Furthermore, there are indications that the site used might be either malicious or incompetent.  However, even if the website is honest and well intentioned, fixing the issue would do nothing for those who have already used it.  Their bitcoin would still be vulnerable.

No.  Only businesses that act as a gateway between BTC and USD (i.e. directly buying or selling bitcoin or facilitating bitcoin to currency trading.)

No, bitcoin banks aren't software providers, they are providing financial services and holding customer funds just like traditional banking institutions.  Appropriate consumer protections in such cases are warranted.
As to services like greenaddress, escrow, or other multisignature services I imagine it would depend if the entity in question has the ability to solely transfer funds without the consent of one or more other interested parties.  
Of course more clarification on these matters is necessary but I take him at his word that these recommendations are intended mainly to protect consumers and prevent money laundering and not to stifle innovation.  They are merely a reflection of regulations that already exist in the financial services sector.  This is how I read it when the proposal was first released and I've always considered the response on this sub to be reactionary. 
If instead of screaming "OH NOES, REGULATION BAD!!!' I think the  Bitcoin community would be better served if they used the extended comment period to enlighten the panel of the possible unintended consequences of certain clauses and working with them to develop more appropriate language instead of decrying any attempt at regulation as anathema.  Clear guidance and regulation are in fact necessary if Bitcoin is ever to live up to its true potential.

No, that is not what I am saying at all.  What I am saying is that the suggestion that you actually need a direct blockchain trail to match against a specific ID declared sale is overkill, unworkable, and unnecessary for both you and the IRS due to the fungible nature of bitcoin.  Look back at the example I gave you.  There is no way to distinguish your "newest" bitcoin from your oldest after a single transaction.  For all intents and purposes they are identical.  Now say you are actively moving bitcoin between wallets and exchanges while making purchases and spending the entire time.  The number of plausible input to trade scenarios quickly becomes near infinite, again, because **INPUTS ARE NOT SERIAL NUMBERS**.  You are not in any way lying or withholding information from the IRS.  You are giving them every bit of information necessary for you and they to calculate your tax liabilities.  They will not ask for any more.  The only reason they would ever consider running a blockchain analysis would not be because they don't believe that your blockchain transaction inputs perfectly match your specified ID sales as reported on your 8949, it would be if there were inconsistencies in your numbers that indicated you were actively trying to launder money or hide assets.

Yes, if you micromanage every input from every single transaction you ever make, it would be possible to use the blockchain on your behalf to prove that your declarations are accurate.  All I am saying is that the IRS cannot do so and prove the reverse therefore requiring blockchain input matching cannot be made a requirement.  Even if they were to try, they would need to develop a completely new form and procedure so you could submit ALL the public keys you have ever used, including change addresses.  This will never happen because it is impractical, expensive, and most importantly, not definitive.
So long as you provide complete and accurate information on your Form 8949 the IRS will be satisfied.

The thing to consider is that since bitcoin is classified as property and not currency, it would suggest that profits could only be determined at the time bitcoin were converted into another asset and it's cost basis subtracted from the sales price.

It is impossible to track any "exact bitcoin."
For example. 
1. I purchase 1 BTC from BoFA
2. transfer it into a wallet where I already have 1 BTC from an anonymous source
3. I transfer everything to a new address in a single transaction.
4. I spend 0.5 BTC at Dell
Did that half bitcoin come from BoFA or from the anonymous source?  The answer is that you cannot tell and it doesn't matter.  That is what fungibility means.  bitcoin do not have serial numbers and cannot be specifically tracked through the blockchain.  The most you can do is link transactions together but any unknown addresses are enough to break the chain of possession.  If you are really paranoid, move your bitcoin a couple of times before spending it for plausible deniability.

I read through all of these comments and I really don't understand the uproar. I read this as both reasonable and expected. It simply says that exchanges, brokers, and online wallet services need to have 100% BTC reserves and follow standard IRS and AML guidelines. These types of institutions are Bitcoin's intersection to the traditional finance system and these regulations are standard. This gives avenue to the liquidity that the bitcoin markets desperately need while still taking a hands off approach in the retail and consumer sectors of the bitcoin economy.
This actually is really good news.

A billion to one doesn't even begin to describe how unlikely this is.

I'm too lazy to look it up now but when I was calculating my gains I found specific guidelines stating unequivocally that reporting bitcoin gains is the same as reporting gains on collectibles (as opposed to securities or real estate).  This means that you can use specific identification to match purchases to sales, therefore FIFO, LIFO, HPFO, or any other methodology you can imagine is fine as long as it adds up.  Even better, this means bitcoin is not subject to wash sales so you can legitimately claim losses from day trading activity even if you are not a broker or investor by trade.  Just report your sales using a Schedule D and Form 8949. 
This is actually a much better position taxwise for bitcoin and its users than if it were treated as a foreign currency.  You just have to keep a record of your transactions but this info is all in your wallets anyway.  A little excel magic from there and you are good to go.
EDIT:  This also however means that you would need to be either extremely careful or extremely foolish if you were to try and hide bitcoin assets from the IRS.  Unless you micro-manage every input when making a transaction, as soon as you report your transactions with their specific amounts and dates, your wallet software and the blockchain will give you up completely in the case of an audit.  Even those 20,000 bits your buddy gave you to cover lunch that he acquired from localbitcoins will be connected to you.

Simply because if you have multiple wallets or trading accounts doing so is completely impractical.  Consider situations such as arbitrage or even just transferring bitcoin between your own wallets,  the complexities of tracking the cost basis for every input becomes essentially impossible in very short order without a very detailed (and expensive) analysis.  Inputs are not equivalent to serial numbers.  The fungibility of bitcoin means that, while transactions can absolutely be tracked, you cannot follow a specific unit of bitcoin though the blockchain as you would an item of inventory through the supply chain or a dollar bill in daily transactions.
EDIT:  Of course you must declare your buy and sell dates and the value of every transaction.  What I am explaining is why you don't need to match specific blockchain inputs to every transaction for IRS auditing purposes with regards to the specific ID method of reporting.  
@_date: 2014-07-26 00:40:26
Armory is by far the best wallet.  I set it up on a completely encrypted offline computer that I use to generate wallets and sign transactions (no need to download to the blockchain to use it in this manner).  I then installed on an online system where I can monitor my watching only wallets, create transactions to be signed by the offline system, and keep a small spending wallet online so I don't have to boot the offline system for minor transactions.  I also import keys from the spending wallet into Mycellium on my Android so I always have bitcoin available that I can spend from either my computer or phone.

This is the argument of somebody with OCD or aspergers.
I am a domain and network administrator and I can't think of the last time I actually used or encountered the term bit professionally in speech or writing, much less server logs.  Even developers, unless they are working on low-level, machine type code or compilers, are unlikely to ever use the word bit with any frequency whatsoever.  Furthermore, when they do speak in terms of data, they are much more likely to use byte.  If a group of developers are working on a bitcoin project while bit shifting data (a situation whose purpose I can't even imagine), any confusion could easily be avoided with a best practice of using μBTC when speaking of money in this specific context.
Additionally, when people do speak of bits (or bytes) in terms of data they will generally use it with the prefixes Mega or Giga which are not practically useful with bits of Bitcoin.  At that level, people will most likely speak in terms of full bitcoin.
Words can and do have multiple meanings.  People can easily determine the meaning by it's context.  The type of misunderstanding you allude to will almost never actually occur in the real world and when it does, the biggest problem likely to result is a few seconds of slight confusion.  This is a small price to pay for the psychological and practical benefits derived from it's use.

The linguistic similarity to Bitcoin and previous connotations are actually the strongest arguments  in favor of using bit.  They psychologically pave the way, therefore bits of a bitcoin just "makes sense" to most people.
What other word could you possibly use that people would easily and naturally associate to Bitcoin, is short and can be easily pluralized, which does not have any conflicting meanings (your requirement, not mine), and does not sound totally contrived?

Actually Coinbase uses their own algorithm for determining prices linked to multiple exchanges but not directly tied to any while also taking into account orders placed within their own system.  It isn't apparent during the very low volume trading we have seen recently but I have seen both buy and sell prices higher than the Mt Gox buy (which towards the end was running several % higher than other exchanges) during high volume rallies and on at least one occasion lower than any major exchange during a crash.

A financial intermediary is an institution that acts as a gateway between the bitcoin economy and the traditional system of cash and banking.  Essentially, if part of your business is to sell, trade, or facilitate the trade of bitcoin into cash or other liquid/financial assets, you are acting as a financial intermediary.  They probably also intend to include bitcoin "banks" or online wallets where the institution holds customer funds and controls the private keys.  This does not include retailers who accept bitcoin nor online services or software where users control their own keys.  
It actually seems pretty clear.

I have yet to hear one real world example where the dual meaning of the word would actually cause anything more than minor, easily overcome confusion.  Developers use bytes and when laymen use the word in terms of computing it is generally prefixed by mega or giga, prefixes which will not likely ever be used with Bitcoin (i.e. 1,000,000 bits will more likely just be called a bitcoin, or full bitcoin, than a megabit).

This is probably the most realistic scenario I've heard for both meanings being used within a single conversation but the casual user likely isn't going to be dealing directly with encryption keys.  If they have advanced to that point there is a strong liklihood they will have already encountered and understand both meanings.  If on the off chance they have not, a quick clarification (or google search) will resolve the issue in that users mind forever.  If you already know that a word has more than one meaning, context is enough to fill in the blanks.

While this is true, one of the ways that conquering regimes legitimized their larceny was to destroy existing records and issue new deeds at which point an honest ownership trail could never be proven and the altered record became the de facto reality.

I bought a 60TH unit during the upswing in Apr 2013 with bitcoin that I had purchased Dec 2011.  BFL said it would be delivered by May.  In May they revised it to July so I sold on ebay.  The buyer was from China and ended up paying me in bitcoin since it was the easiest option.  Even though the cash value he paid (~$4000) was triple mine, I ended up with almost the exact same number of bitcoin as I started after adjusting for the auction fee.  A fun adventure but I ended up no better or worse than if I just held those coins through the bubble and crash.
As to the miner itself, it ended up arriving at my door many months later.  I managed to contact the buyer and shipped it out the same day at my own expense but he didn't seem to care.  Afterwards, I calculated the lifetime return to be just a fraction of the bitcoin value he (and I originally) had paid.

In my opinion Armory is far and away the best wallet available.  Deterministic, multi-wallet management, key control, multi-sig, offline signing, etc and the interface is pretty straight forward.  It will take time and disk space to first download the blockchain then create it's own database of transactions from that and about equal in size but after that it works like a charm.  I can even share keys between an Armory hot wallet and Mycellium so I can monitor balances and spend from multiple devices.  
The only time I will use a different wallet is if I am setting up a system with limited resources in which case I'll use Electrum.

Because without the private key they would have no ability to send anything.  Even if they have access to your reddit account they have no access to your wallet, just your public key.  This does not provide them any way to spend the funds because your private key is still completely under your own control.  Changetip is a different service completely.  There your account is associated with the private key(s) which means that money can be both sent and received.

That's always been the problem and will likely continue to be for a long time.  Banking is one of the most heavily regulated industries on the planet and for good reason.

Not that it doesn't have many niches where it can be appropriately integrated, remittances being a prime example.  However, until exchanges and/or brokers have clear regulatory guidelines and access to traditional banking and financial services in many countries, Bitcoin will never achieve more mainstream adoption.

Look at the mock-up.  The only option you have is to provide an public address which means that you are the one controlling the private key.  If they were planning on integrating native tipping then they would necessarily need to implement a wallet to associate to your account.  If this were the case, there would be no need for you to provide a public key because it would be generated automatically since they would already control the private key.

An argument I have used before in favor of bit is that I would expect developers, especially those working on Bitcoin related projects, to simply adopt a best practice of using the "proper" terminology for the currency, i.e. microbitcoin or µBTC.  Engineers already have the tools and knowledge required to deal with this situation.  
For laymen and casual users, this will almost never present itself as an issue and on those rare occasions when it does, any confusion can be quickly and easily clarified.  That is unless a person is hopelessly dense, but then life is going to be hard for them anyway.  One additional intractable mystery won't make much of a difference.

The Soviet Union was more a totalitarian dictatorship than a socialist republic.  The closest examples of true socialism are the contemporary Scandinavian nations.  
Socialism is populist and non-authoritarian by nature.  The quasi-socialism of Lenin and Mao was doomed to fail from the beginning because rather than arising naturally out of a post-industrial, post scarcity economies, it was being imposed on impoverished feudal economies.

No, a Satoshi consensus referred to how the network should seek consensus in the event of a hard fork and more specifically that it was in the best interests of everybody involved to follow the chain with the majority hashrate.  This power was definitively granted to the miners from the very beginning.
@_date: 2017-03-21 18:04:15
I've been involved in Bitcoin well before most users here and my understanding from the beginning is that consensus was established by the miners through majority hashrate and that in the instance of a fork the chain with the lower hashrate would eventually be orphaned as interested parties would move their resources to the dominant chain.  This wasn't seen as "centralized miners could have too much power over the network" but rather as the preferred method of establishing consensus.  Furthermore, this wasn't considered a bug.  It was called a "satoshi consensus" and it was well understood that this is how Bitcoin was supposed to work by design.  It is only now that Core is losing the consensus of miners that I have seen this principle questioned.

My guess is somebody is trying to manipulate the market by attempting to cause a panic, push the price down, and buy in lower.  My hope, which actually appears to be the case, is that he market is more resilient than they anticipated and they are losing their shirts.  Even better if prior to doing so they placed a huge short position and are forced to buy back in pushing prices even higher.
Of course there is the giant possibility I have no idea what I'm talking about so take this with a huge grain of sand.
EDIT:  I just saw that Coinbase was down which I believe supports my theory and matches the pattern seen in the first run up of 2013.  You would see a regular pattern as a whale (in retrospect I suspect the Winklevi) would place a huge dump while simultaneously DDOSing Mt Gox.  This happened many times in the run up from $10 to $200.

* Yes
* No
* Yes
* Yes, namely the failure to implement Segwit2x.  
With 8MB blocks in addition to Segwit not only would the mempool never have fallen into such a backlog but the cost of a spam attack for the purpose of increasing fees would have gone up exponentially.  Broadcasting a million low fee transactions might fill the mempool but doesn't actually increase fees.  To that you actually need to put some money behind it which is much easier when legitimate traffic is nearly filling blocks on their own.  It only takes a few extra high fee transactions to trigger a market failure.  With larger blocks high fee spam transactions would have to outnumber legitimate ones by an order of magnitude making such an attack cost prohibitive.
Are larger blocks the answer to the scaling problem?  Of course not.  Second layer solutions are necessary and inevitable.  However Segwit2x would have given the network enough breathing room to avoid the last fee crisis while other solutions are developed. Additionally, no matter what second layer solutions are implemented, a 1MB block limit will never be sufficient to allow bitcoin to become a true global payment network.  Hopefully we will get a true block size increase as well as code to determine the optimal block size before blocks start to fill again and fees inevitably skyrocket.

Again, you are looking at this from the perspective of Alice.  Instead, think of yourself as Bob.  You have just received an email request for 0.08 BTC from Alice for some product or service over the internet.  You have Mycellium installed on your phone and wish to honor the request, however, instead of a Bitcoin address or even a link to a Bitcoin address, all you receive is a link to sign up for Coinbase.  Your only options are to a) sign up for Coinbase even though you may not have any need or desire to use them, b) ignore the request, or c) reply to Alice asking her to send a proper Bitcoin address.  If Alice doesn't understand Bitcoin any deeper than to make a request through her Coinbase app, she might not even know how to do so.  What is Bob's option then? Try to walk her through the process of finding her public key on an app he may never have seen over via email, phone, or text?  Bob is inconvenienced despite having a good understanding of Bitcoin and not due to any decisions he himself has made.  
Simply adding a bitcoin address to the email, or at the least, the linked page would fix this problem completely.

You obviously do not understand the point of this post.  Instead of looking at it from the viewpoint of the person requesting money, do so from that of the person who received a payment request from the app which nowhere contains a public address.  Their only options are to sign up for Coinbase or ignore the request.  There is no way for them to simply pay the request from their own wallet because the app does not include any public key in the request.

[I've posted about this before](  The issue isn't when you are trying to send bitcoin or even trying to request bitcoin.  It is when somebody sends you a request for bitcoin using the android or ios apps.  Instead of receiving a Bitcoin address or even a link to a Bitcoin address, all you receive is a link to sign up for Coinbase.  You can't honor the request without doing so even if you have a different wallet with bitcoin already in it.
It is even more of a hassle if the person making the request isn't Bitcoin savvy and doesn't quite understand what a Bitcoin address is. You have to walk them through the process of logging in to their account and copying &amp; pasting their deposit address into a text or email instead of simply making the request through the app.
All of this could be easily solved if Coinbase would simply include a QR/bitcoin address on the linked page along with the ability to sign up (if you wish).  Forcing you to sign up/sign in to complete the request is inconvenient and unnecessary.

Apparently you don't understand the issue.  This isn't about the person sending the request, it is about the person receiving it.  Unless they sign up for Coinbase, they cannot honor the request.  They would need to reply to the person making the request to send an actual bitcoin address.  If that person has just a rudimentary knowledge of Bitcoin or the internet, which is probably why they are using Coinbase as a wallet in the first place, this might not be as simple for them as it is you or I.  
This can be resolved easily by including an actual Bitcoin address next to the sign up link on the webpage or even better, in the request email itself.

u/Frogolocalypse hasn't got a clue as to what he is talking about.  You were correct in that you will need to back up your wallet.dat file every time you make a transaction because Bitcoin Core generates new keys randomly.  There is no seed capable of regenerating Bitcoin Core keys.
There are other wallets such as Armory or Electrum that use what are called deterministic seeds which are capable of generating (and regenerating) the same keys repeatedly.  Use that type of wallet if you wish to have a backup that is capable of restoring every private key in the wallet that you won't have to update.

The network goes where the hashrate is.  Bitcoin can run effectively with only 5% of the nodes currently online.  Good luck waiting 6 months for the difficulty adjustment any non-SegWit2x chain will need before block propagation resumes back to a functional rate.
@_date: 2017-06-21 06:40:04
From the very beginning Bitcoin was designed to be controlled by the miners (majority hashrate) as they are the ones who have made tangible investments in the blockchain itself, the idea being that in the event of a contentious hard fork those on the losing chain would ultimately move to the winning chain out of simple self interest.  Fear not, this is how it is suppose to work.  Ideas such as UASF are destined to fail because Bitcoin can only have one viable chain and it will always follow the hashrate.  Again, this is how it was designed by Satoshi Nakamoto himself and all the smoke and mirrors you read here cannot change that.

Then they will be left behind as envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto himself (i.e "Satoshi Consensus").  Miners are essential to the network.  Nodes help to gather and broadcast the transactions but ultimately you don't really need that many of them for the network to function.  If the miners move on nodes that aren't upgraded will become obsolete and useless.
@_date: 2017-06-20 23:55:20
Actually the wallet.dat file generates and stores a few keys (I think 5 is the default) in advance so you can make a few transactions without backing up.  You can also force it to pre-generate I believe up to 100 keys though I don't remember the process.
In the end it would be better to use a deterministic wallet.  Since you have already downloaded the blockchain with Bitcoin Core you can simply layer Armory over the top.  It is easily the most secure software wallet (when set up properly) and has many advanced features.  The only real disadvantage is that its deterministic seeds aren't compatible with other deterministic wallets such as Electrum, Mycellium, or Trevor.
