op asked:


the answer is worse than yes. **the most influential bitcoin developers founded** a for profit company than recived over 70 mil $ from investors and with the money hired more developers.
to what end one can ask?
why fund a company of bitcoin developers with 70 mil$?
how are they going to make a profit?
are they going to develop bitcoin protocol for the grater good or are they going to bend the rules in their favor?
are their investors good samaritans and place bitcoin future in front of profit?
why are they stubborn and not allow onchain scaling?
these are just a some of the questions that makes you ponder about this topic.

According to wikipedia. **A conflict of interest (COI) is a situation in which a person or organization is involved in multiple interests, financial interest, or otherwise, one of which could possibly corrupt the motivation of the individual or organization.**
Does this situation apply to your position as a developer and also a founder of a for profit company? Can your motivation as a bitcoin developer be corruped by your company need to make profit?

i have to disagree. **A conflict of interest is a situation in which a person or organization is involved in multiple interests, financial interest, or otherwise, one of which could possibly corrupt the motivation of the individual or organization.**
the question is, are they in a position were thay can be corupted and use their developer status to bend the game in favor of their for profit company?

No. I run the node home on and I don't even notice it. The bandwidth is not a problem since in my 3rd world country 1Gb connection is under $10. And disk space? What about it? A 4Tb hdd is around $100.  


I would run a node even if the blocksize were 20mb.


Both problems (overloaded mempool and high fees) would disappear if the blocksize was increased now and then search for additional solutions. No centralisation issues could come from a small blocksize increase because both bandwidth and storage are tiny compared to normal use of internet. (a webpage has more than 1mb and loads in under a sec.)

Lightning sounds great and i hope to see it soon working but yesterday i saw in another thread a quote from Blockstream co-founder Alex Fowler that was not so optimistic:

Is this true?

The simple answer is that the user who said he is responsible for 800 nodes is lying. I dont belive a month old account without proof ....
@_date: 2017-03-26 19:53:59
To add to your comment, for those that will say that keeping all transactions onchain is expensive, I made an evaluation for the cost of storing a transaction on all nodes.
For that I will evaluate the cost of a node and then the cost of storing a transaction on the blockchain. Lets assume that our example node is a Raspberry Pi 3 Kit with power adapter and case (50$ on amazon) and an external hdd (4Tb - 110$ on amazon). That would be a total of 160 $. If you want a different configuration you can extrapolate the costs at the end. As additional costs I will evaluate power consumption for running a node for 5 years and add that to the cost of operating the node (2.4 watts for 5 years gives us ~100KWH and a total cost of 12$). Total price of a running node for 5 years is 172$. If you read this I will assume that you have internet connection and that a running node on a decent connection will not impact the performance of the network.
At the moment of writing this post the blockchain is 106 Gb in size and contains 204 mil transactions in total. My node has a total of 4TB space available so no matter the blocksize it can store ~8 billion transactions.
A single transaction would cost my node 172$/8bil=0.0000000215$ or 0.00000215 cents. Lets see how much it costs to the entire network. ~6400 nodes x 0.00000215 cents = 0.01376 cents. To give you perspective, 72 transactions would costs the network 1 cent. Even if I double the cost of my node (for those who would say that not everybody runs raspberry) that still gives us a total network cost of 1 cent for 36 transactions. And for the skeptics out there I will quadruple the total nodes cost to 1 cent for 18 transactions. 
*If is that cheap to store transactions onchain is it wrong to ask why bother with offchain at least for the next 5-10 years?*
**TL;DR A transaction costs in terms of resources used on the entire network 0.01376 cents! (or 72 transactions for 1 cent). In reality users pay more for a transaction because they pay the miners for securing that transaction, but the actual cost for the network to store the transaction is extremely cheap.**

Let's make a mental exercise. If Ver sells his coins on the core chain that means that a fork happened. The only way a fork can happen now is if the BU has more than 80% hashpower. If BU has more than 80% hashpower, according to chapter 3 of the whitepaper (**The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it.**), it means that BU is Bitcoin and Core is altcoin. So Ver selling his Core coins is more then logical but is also good for the future of Bitcoin as it helps to kill the weaker chain. I suggest you do the same and sell the weak chain coins so that it dies quickly.

Cheap altcoins not Bitcoins. 
As I said before: If a big player sells his coins on the Core chain that means that a fork happened. The only way a fork can happen now is if the BU has more than 80% hashpower. If BU has more than 80% hashpower, according to chapter 4 of the whitepaper (**The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it**), it means that BU is Bitcoin and Core is altcoin. So selling Core coins is more then logical and is also good for the future of Bitcoin as it helps to kill the weaker chain. I suggest you do the same and sell the weak chain coins so that it dies quickly.

If 75% of Bitcoin miners mine something that something is called Bitcoin. The remaining 25% is an altcoin, read the whitepaper.
@_date: 2017-03-21 21:09:43
The big chain has more hashpower and can kill the small one at will.
@_date: 2017-03-19 21:45:00
Read again the whitepaper, chain with the most work is bitcoin, so if 70% of miners work a chain, that chain is bitcoin, end of story.
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:34:39
denied by who? by some nodes? miners don't care of nodes, miners mine bicoin and nodes are free to join the network or not. miners are the ones that invested the most in the network and is in their interest that bitcoin does not lose its value. so, if the miners in agreement decide to do something it means that its in their best interest to do so, their interest being bitcoin value.
you can agree or not with their decision, but in the end their decision is made with the hope that bitcoin will increase in value. this is their business, to mine bitcoin for profit and all they do is to make bitcoin succeed (make profit)..
@_date: 2016-03-18 08:04:22
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:23:10
Exactly as you said in your example with 70% of hashpower, miners, in general agreement (consensus), make decisions. If they are in consensus(general agreement) they can't attack bitcoin because they are bitcoin. (Bitcoin is the chain with the most work). You must think outside the box.

Yes symmetric, last time I checked upload was slightly better then download. 10mbps up is crazy slow, even so if you didn't had caps you could run a node on it without a problem. Even with 10MB blocks you can upload one block every 8 seconds.

I live in a second world country (maybe 3rd world) and here bandwidth is never the issue, I pay equivalent of 5$ for 300mb connection without caps, 10$ for gigabit, so maybe Bitcoin is for the unbanked were internet is cheap and limitless as Bitcoin should be.

bandwidth? from what year are you from?
My existing home connection handles my node without a glitch. I can't factor in the bandwidth cost because I don't think there is a single node out there that has a **dedicated** internet connection just for it. So no, no bandwidth price in the 3rd millennium.
And for the 2.4 watts. That is the power consumption of a pi3. If you run your node on a pc keep in mind that the actual running of the node consumption is very low. If you like you can multiply that by 10 but the end result is still absurdly low.
When we will reach 25bil transactions the cost of storing them will be extremely low, lower then today. Just a few day ago there was an article on reddit about a device that fits on your palm and can store 400tb.

You [cherry picked]( your arguments from some websites that suited your current needs.
From [wikipedia](
 An argument from authority, also called an **appeal to authority**, or the argumentum ad verecundiam, is a form of defeasible argument in which a claimed authority's support is used as evidence for an argument's conclusion. It is well known as a fallacy, though it is used in a cogent form when all sides of a discussion agree on the **reliability** of the authority in the given context.
Historically, opinion on the appeal to authority has been divided – it has been held to be a valid argument about as often as it has been considered an outright fallacy.
In the Western rationalistic tradition and in early modern philosophy, appealing to authority was generally considered a logical fallacy.

Why does segwit need a logo?
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:00:24
Just stop.
@_date: 2017-04-01 21:07:25
I was asking a question, not asking you directly. If you dont know the answer its not a problem, maybe someone else does.
@_date: 2017-04-01 20:55:32
Bitcoin is a currency and all currencies have simbols(logos). But segwit is just a proposal for improvment. Are there other proposals that have logos?
@_date: 2016-09-04 05:28:17
[maybe this]( They are no.3 now.
@_date: 2016-09-15 10:26:51
False. We dont need nodes that cant handle &gt;1mb blocks. We need reliable nodes.
@_date: 2016-09-15 15:03:58
Scaling bitcoin onchain wont decrease the number of nodes to a few hundred overnight. I might venture to say that if we need more than 1mb blocks than we have more transactions. More transactions means more users and from more users there might sprung more nodes.

Next generation miners will mine old unspent addresses.

Job done. Go to the cashier office now.
@_date: 2017-10-31 07:35:27
Lol. You just made an argument for the opposing team.
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:08:42
Fake consensus. Check the adoption of segwit. Now at 10%
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:34:00
Your arguments are compelling.
@_date: 2017-10-25 10:48:33


By trust. People will trust Blockstream (core hubs) and connect to them. But you already know that.
Also, if we are talking about money, how is Blockstream supposed to make money? If not by that route, then how?
@_date: 2017-10-31 09:34:48
TLDR:  Bitcoin is the chain with the most work. Trezor is mad that Bitcoin is Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:25:40
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:35:00
It seams that you are the one who does not know.
@_date: 2017-10-31 09:37:58
Sockpuppet does what it's supposed to do, that's why. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:00:39
Anyone can do that but people will connect to trusted hubs. And who is more trusted and popular then core developers (blockstream funders)?
@_date: 2017-10-25 10:56:59
He is not right. And the irony is huge. Core pushed for Segwit (because they claimed there is consensus) and after months [adoption peaked at 18%, now droped to 10%]( How is that consensus, how is that not taking control of bitcoin by a handful of people?
@_date: 2016-10-27 10:49:02
Who said anything about a *contentious* hard fork. I think that you are just a concern troll. Everybody talks and thinks about consensus and here you are exaggerating.
@_date: 2016-10-26 07:02:33
One camp wants to let market decide the blocksize and the other camp wants a more centralized solution and let a certain team of developers set the blocksize.
@_date: 2016-10-18 10:28:27
blocks are full. Even if you find a period when the blocks are not full to the brimm that does not mean that the blocks are not full more then enough. Why argue that the blocks are not full when there are **days** when the blocks are full folowed by periods of not so full blocks. Why do we need **days** of postponed confirmation time? Is that beneficial to bitcoin economy?
@_date: 2017-10-31 09:24:45
Joke ———&gt;
Your head.
@_date: 2016-10-17 20:37:22
False. Its normal for the average to be under 1 mb and the blocks to be full because some pools mine empty blocks. So the average might seem lower than 1mb  but in reality **the blocks are full**
@_date: 2016-10-11 08:32:07
Could be. But [this]( might be the real reason.
@_date: 2016-10-27 09:26:19


No its not. That how bitcoin is suposed to work. Its actualy a straight forword process. Stop the fear mongering.


Again fear mongering. [Something bad happened in the past]( and we swiched back. Simple as that. People folow their mony value. If is better for them it will happen.
@_date: 2016-10-19 08:56:53


That condescending tone does not help your position. Now returning to fees. Even if I pay a higher fee that does not magicaly increase the blocksize. The same insuficient number of transactions get included in the block. This is a selfish reasoning: *I pay more and I bump your tranzaction from the block*.
Think of the scenario where someone pays the proper fee to be included in the next block and then it doesnt because someone else outbid him.
The constant bidding to get in the next block only raises the fees. This is not a solution, but you already know that. We both know that you do.
@_date: 2016-10-27 09:15:38
As I said in another response to a diferent user. If you support a reasonable blocksize increase that means that you support a hardfork. We also know that a hardforked segwit is better then a softfork one, but the developers also knowing this still push for softfork. And  that only means that they dont want a blocksize increase.
@_date: 2016-10-27 09:09:53
So what you are saying is to activate segwit trough soft fork and then hard fork for a blocksize increase? That does not make sense. If you agree to a hard fork why do it later and not at the same time with segwit. As I understand hardfork segwit is superior to the softfork one. The developers know this and still push for softfork and that only means one thing: **They dont want a blocksize increase.**
@_date: 2016-10-27 08:40:18
I think that bitcoin should be alowed to set its own blocksize value through consensus and not forced on it by developers. Some might argue that the blocksize could lead to centralization but at the same time dismiss the problem of development centralization which in my opinion is a much bigger problem and could be the source of this controversial issue.
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:39:15
We both know how segwit was adopted. By facked consensus thus the decline in adoption.
@_date: 2017-05-18 03:47:57
Today some miners have more control of bitcoin, tomorow there will be others. Whoever those are. THEY have the most to win if bitcoin succed and the more to lose if bitcoin fails. So no, Satoshi was not wrong, he was a genius.
@_date: 2017-05-19 07:33:11
The debunked answer of adrian-x to the write-up is more valuable as is fits more to the economic reality.
@_date: 2017-05-18 03:43:17
Its simple economy. The ones who invested more in bitcoin are the ones that have more to win if bitcoin succeed. So more money invested=more hashing power=more decision power=more to gain if bitcoin succed. But you already know that.
@_date: 2017-05-20 20:54:21
That buit can handle blocks 10x larger. That is also true for most nodes. Why do people support congestion and unreliable transaction times? 
@_date: 2017-07-07 19:46:36
Your analogy is flawed. The first comment was about bitcoin being a cockroach and you say now billions? If you are talking about users, billions of them, than my analogy is good and bitcoin is BIG and STRONG. But if you want billions of users then bitcoin must scale onchain. 1 mb cant hold billions of users even with segwit n lightning
@_date: 2017-07-28 08:11:10
Get your information from many sources. Dont be a part of an echochamber.
@_date: 2017-07-25 09:51:26
People say that its an altcoin, a scam, shitcoin .. you get the picture. I see it as a way to go back to the original blockchain if segwit activation produces troubles.
@_date: 2017-07-22 06:22:15
SegWit is not a the best scaling solution. It takes 4MB of space for a max 1.7 MB of transactions. So if we are willing to use 4MB then why dont we do it the right way and increase the blocksize to 4MB. That is why people rejected SegWit up until the NYA.
@_date: 2017-07-25 09:55:05
People wait for the whole 1st august event to settle, that's what is happening.

At some point that coachroach will be cornered and squashed. For Bitcoin to survive for generations it must be **BIG** and **STRONG** like an elefant and everybody should have the opportunity to participate according to their necessity (lightweight client, full node, prunned node, mining node, side-chain etc.)
@_date: 2017-07-08 14:05:38
1 mb blocks are not enough for lighting network
@_date: 2017-05-21 04:20:19
Excelent writeup. You earnd your keep. I hope that you can live with yourself. Why do you use words like danger, suicide  or tricky. There is nothing dangerous about increasing blocksize. Why do you lie? In a world were internet speed average is huge you are proposing a convoluted solution to a simple problem. Changing a constant is simpler then any other proposal.
@_date: 2017-06-22 05:27:28
Until RBF was introducted people used to trust 0 conf for small transactions.
@_date: 2017-06-06 07:24:16
Or let the market choose the blocksize instead of central planning.
Miners are the ones who want bitcoin to succeed the most.
