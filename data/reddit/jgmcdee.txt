Bitcoin isn't the first iteration, though.  It's the first iteration which has gained any sort of acceptance or mainstream visibility, but that's a different thing entirely.

You are thinking of bitcoin as a physical asset rather than a global currency in its own right. They answer is that when you want to spend your money you spend bitcoin, not convert it to fiat and then spend it. 
The sooner people realise this the better things will be for everyone.

One really important thing you need to do is to ensure that someone else can access your wallet once you have died. A combination of passphrase and physical entity (Yubikey or similar) appears to be mandatory for this. Not sure if any wallet programs have thus feature yet though.

Which is great until your wife runs off with your best friend *and* all your bitcoins.

Don't expect Mt. Gox to go much higher for a while, there's a big sell order sitting around $273.  Someone out there is cashing in ~$2.5MM...

Something to understand about transaction fees is that they have multiple purposes.  One of them which I haven't seen noted here is that they reduce the viability of transactions with very small outputs.  This is important because every transaction output which has not been spent is potentially part of an input further down the line, and so it and the block it is part of need to be kept around in working memory, as opposed to archive, in case it is used at a later date.  Very small outputs (known as "dust") are unspendable (right now) due to the transaction fee, hence people don't create them.
To give you an example of the issue, as of now approximately 5 million of the total 12 million unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) are in the microBTC or lower range.  So these just clog up the system with very little useful purpose today.
As the value of bitcoin increases the value of dust will increase too, and it is expected that the definition of dust will be altered through the lowering of transaction fees.  There are other, more adaptive, ways of handling transaction fees as well but they will need time and care to set up to avoid those who will otherwise game the system

I believe that the problem with Bitcoin is that there are not currently viable alternatives to banks aka somewhere where bitcoins can be stored in such a way that they are insured by the entity storing them, and ultimately but the government or similar, to make the average person feel safe.

Bitcoin manages values as integer units of satoshis.  There is no reason why the code could not be changed to allow for smaller subdivisions, but that would mean a protocol change.
The reality is that there are many things that would be issues way before the divisibility of a satoshi became important, block size and block frequency are the two obvious ones.
Right now it appears that the most likely scenario is that there are additional blockchains set up which have exchange rates relative to BTC and as such can act as further subdivisions of stores of value.  1 satoshi might be worth 1,000,000 units of value of another blockchain, and that blockchain can also handle issues such as block size and frequency through additional parameters.  All of this, of course, assuming that bitcoin becomes prevalent enough for this to matter.

Thinking out loud, but how about on entering the store (or beforehand) the shopper puts some amount of bitcoins in to an escrow transaction with the shop as the other party.  This can then be resolved by:
  - the shopper buys something at the shop.  The shop knows that the coins cannot be double spent because they're locked up in an confirmed (though not complete) transaction
  - the shopper does not buy something at the shop, the escrow times out and the coins come back to the shopper
Not sure of the state of escrow in Bitcoin, been a while since I looked at it.  But this should be possible, and seems like something that is not too much hassle for either side for any payment of size.

Order book perhaps, but trades nope.  The volumes traded can be seen at  where bitstamp and mtgox are generally within a few points of each other

The main thing that matters regarding growth of the blockchain is the UTXO (unspent transaction output) count.  These are where unspent funds are held, and so you can think of them as the 'live' state of Bitcoin, as opposed to the entire blockchain which is the complete history.
Of course, the UTXO is growing as well and is expected to continue to grow as more people adopt Bitcoin, individual bitcoins are worth more in other currencies, and in general as Bitcoin is used for more transactions.  There's a chart around somewhere, let me dig it out and see if I can link to it.

That's something to think about.  How can we collectively get an ISO standard symbol for Bitcoin?  It might seem a bit "establishment" for many people here, but the reality is that if we want Bitcoin to be taken seriously then it will need to have representation in areas like this.
