@_date: 2015-12-05 01:47:01
He actively sent cease and desist letters to companies trying to expose gaw while knowing it was fraudulent because he was "defending" them. He should be executed along with Homero.
Maybe the answer is not to help in the cover up and helping more people get scammed while "defending". That's not defense, that's participation in fraud. I've reported it to the bar association. At that point he was not a "defense attorney" he was complicit in fraud and getting paid by it. At that point he was helping Homero make more money not defend him. And he was accepting that money as payment.

There is a possibility of theft and the thief can wipe out all order books to 0 worldwide. That old private key can't use multi sig or newer features without moving.
@_date: 2015-12-11 01:21:25
That's fraudulent market manipulation on their part, probably done to pump certain coins during certain times, it's quite genius

@_date: 2015-11-16 04:30:36
You should look into multisig though otherwise the other person can claim "they got stolen"

Bastards are slow
@_date: 2015-11-04 14:11:19
For higher amounts you should be signing offline, that way the key can't escape period.

Once you send your Bitcoin you may never get it back
@_date: 2015-11-04 12:21:55

They're clowns, lying while funding terrorists themselves

@_date: 2015-11-04 13:45:33
No your key never gets transmitted. What tool do you use? Use one with a fee that can be set.
 There's no risk of losing funds though unless the bad tool steals your key and that'll happen no matter the fee.
@_date: 2015-11-04 16:15:13
I think yours is old
@_date: 2015-11-08 23:22:14

What did they do
@_date: 2015-11-21 00:03:51
I wonder how long the api calls take during a transaction. And if coinbase is slow it can fail.

Easy way to lose your Bitcoin if you're into that
@_date: 2015-11-09 22:34:11
But it's what you wanted...
@_date: 2015-10-27 21:34:43
A guess is $150-200 per Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-11-18 05:39:18
Have you tried smaller amounts

You shouldn't but it's not the end of the world if you do
@_date: 2015-10-29 09:53:50
Except if the nsa is btce for this exact reason
@_date: 2015-11-04 14:08:43
Keys are never transmitted by anyone ever. You don't have to consider it compromised but a fresh one is good.
Your situation is like reusing an address, it's done all the time but using each address once is recommended. So in your case a new paper wallet.
@_date: 2015-10-24 21:33:49
I use a proxy
@_date: 2015-10-31 12:51:35

@_date: 2015-11-30 11:06:33
Try the recent Satoshi art
@_date: 2015-11-05 11:09:11

Who can change the price? 
@_date: 2015-11-04 12:14:59
Bitpay will let you do 15 minute pricing
@_date: 2015-11-12 10:42:59
Yeah or competitors
@_date: 2015-11-09 02:31:41
Not if they modify it, they can fork anything
@_date: 2015-11-01 13:46:59
They should stick to their own shitcoin

Try a small pruned node and see if it keeps up.

Circle does debit free and no bank fees
@_date: 2015-10-18 05:19:37
Most are 400 not 15

Gox was a founding member, another member keeps trying to pump shitcoins, a lot of their Bitcoin "disappeared", I forget what else
@_date: 2015-10-23 22:35:14
They'll accept the first unless the second gets another built on top then it becomes the longest chain and the first gets orphaned. Longest chain always wins 
@_date: 2015-10-19 02:11:37
No a to z guarantee? 
@_date: 2015-10-24 22:50:38
Can it proxy? 
@_date: 2015-10-19 03:18:11
Nothing I'm glad
I hope other developers protect themself too
@_date: 2015-10-24 22:56:46
I'd rather it be built in but how can you proxy any app?
@_date: 2015-10-25 00:06:04
Why would they give it to you when they can just keep it? They're waiting for 6 months to "lock"your account aka steal
@_date: 2015-10-28 18:06:28
I'd buy a copy if needed
@_date: 2015-10-20 13:28:05
Idk about good guy. You have to haggle for a partial refund. I trust him but it's still shady.
@_date: 2015-10-27 00:12:01
Looks expensive and luxurious, they need to just sell gallons of the liquid and I'll diy
@_date: 2015-10-26 18:48:50
The seed can keep creating new addresses, maybe the address you're looking for is deeper. Keep clicking receive and see if it'll create more addresses. Or check the options for a depth setting
@_date: 2015-11-23 22:36:21
But how do you send transactions over tor but stay clear net? 
@_date: 2015-11-19 08:35:23
Yes it's been a few months, they're a fraud
@_date: 2015-11-04 06:38:28
What do you sell? 
@_date: 2015-11-04 12:20:23
They don't use any sites we use like Reddit or Facebook
@_date: 2015-11-10 04:15:41
No one will stop you from not running a node
@_date: 2015-11-24 09:51:08
I think you're perfect for vers forum
@_date: 2015-10-17 15:37:55
Arbiteurs get paid for the risk, it's not that easy or everyone would be doing it and there would be no spread
@_date: 2015-10-21 22:21:37
Sorry but I'd trust rushwallet over this
@_date: 2015-10-21 07:17:25
Circle takes debit card
@_date: 2015-10-22 12:58:46
They don't get keys
@_date: 2015-10-27 21:42:26
There's an attack but you can't lose anything. Your transaction id may simply change that's it
@_date: 2015-11-22 15:59:54

Windows has a huge fonts security hole. Make sure you're patched. Luke is trusted though but watch out for this new vector from others.
@_date: 2015-11-23 15:11:39

@_date: 2015-10-28 22:16:10
From Batman? 
@_date: 2015-10-22 19:52:10
Yes it does
@_date: 2015-11-17 23:05:00
I think fonts can do whatever they want, they just have a code to use now
@_date: 2015-11-12 07:52:55
It's not in your history? It should be
@_date: 2015-11-04 12:13:09
No the fee is usually .0001

Nerd alert
@_date: 2015-11-04 14:17:14
You should have done this before with small amounts to test everything and learn
@_date: 2015-11-08 23:21:27
Never store Bitcoin with coinbase
@_date: 2015-11-24 09:48:58
I'll try one
@_date: 2015-11-09 02:32:47
Like havelock? No
@_date: 2015-11-17 23:02:14
For operating systems to display it, yes we need the code
@_date: 2015-11-18 01:20:43
@_date: 2015-10-21 19:47:54
What's so great about a scam? 
@_date: 2015-10-28 09:10:04

They'll keep catching each other stealing

Very nice update, it would be a shame for anyone not to update! 
@_date: 2015-11-24 13:11:26
Maybe you should just buy her a gift card at gyft.com using fiat or square cash. Bitcoin is great once you're in but if you've never used it, you need more than an hour to learn
@_date: 2015-10-27 04:14:18
I thought currentc was killed
@_date: 2015-11-17 07:35:43
Very risky

The police are stealing and killing without consequence, the "bad"money then becomes clean after passing through their bloody hands? 
@_date: 2015-10-21 16:55:54
Where'd he go
@_date: 2015-10-27 01:02:59
Damn ver is annoying, his shit forum doesn't even send email verifications so you can sign in

You like guns? I would've never guessed
@_date: 2015-10-24 17:36:06
My original plan was to buy utorrent pro but there was no way I was going to enter my credit card or address.
 A place where I would only use Bitcoin didn't accept Bitcoin and thankfully found qbittorent, not only can I pay using Bitcoin, it was optional! 
@_date: 2015-10-24 04:56:35
Libertyx should work
@_date: 2015-11-16 13:59:49
There's people desperate to crash Bitcoin but it's becoming harder each day

Bitcoin didn't work
@_date: 2015-10-19 13:58:42

They don't use any sites we use like Reddit or Facebook. Real ethnic Chinese aren't anywhere here.
@_date: 2015-11-05 08:13:34
They don't care about Bitcoin, their primary focus is paycoin

Yup sometimes you can even skip heat sinks and wasted space
@_date: 2015-10-21 11:59:35
Cloud mining is always a scam

You make us look like neck beards! 
@_date: 2015-11-02 10:55:44
Mmm=fud unless it's in China. I only see mmm in India, south Africa and Philippines though. Those don't have much Bitcoin volume. 
Those poor people being robbed, I don't see them buying Bitcoin. China has had huge ponzis before but I think they've learned.
