Anyone who takes your money for no legitimate reason is scamming you. Nicehash is taking advantage of incoming transactions. That's a legitimate complaint, so I complain. If nothing changes that's on them, I've stopped using their services because that's not the only issues I've run into. Anyone who is not scamming or isn't willing to scam shouldn't have anything to fear or hide. Which is another red flag that this isn't legitimate.
The problem is that new people to bitcoin don't understand what it's really costing them to mine bitcoins, calculator aside, you must factor in the damage to your PC it does. If they are willing to hide behind a proxy domain, issue a download that they themselves cannot stop from popping up on any antivirus, and hey are taking money on incoming transactions for again no reason. That's a scam. They need to change their dealings with business. Either A) they are capitalizing on the uneducated miners by charging incoming fees, I honestly don't care what the amount is they charge.
What's worst is that their TOS doesn't even specify much about the fee, so in my case I had 8 dollars stolen from me legitimately, they spammed me with literally the same message copy and pasted, and so my point is. If you're looking to be apart of something bigger or want to go somewhere that isn't going to back stab you and send to the same message over and over again then don't go to nicehash. I just started this, by then taking my 8 dollars, that's like 150% of what I've earned through them alone. So tell me how they aren't a problem again?
