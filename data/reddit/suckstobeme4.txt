Yea, But im not loosing faith in humanity yet. There are decent, honest people still around, unfortunally the degenerates and lowlifes are reproducting quicker...but I will get my money back, of this im sure. I will hunt her down and..and..do something...like get my $400 back...Im not violent person lol

I didnt know SR was having an issue, Ignorance isnt an excuse but I wasnt privy to this...Its been 3 months since ive dabbled in SR

So...should i contact ebay and let them know she scammed me, i have emails on ebays website that shows she would put 4 btc when i gave her the moneypak ?
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:20:28
because I live in a state where its a felony to smok some herb let alone grow it...., trust, Im moving after i finish school. Funny enough I just moved from Bellingham Washington literally 1 month after it became decriminalized...FML

moneypak is only able to be bought with $$$

just talked to ebay, they will handle it and do everything they can to get my money back, including helping the police. They also advised me to call my local police tomorrow morning to give the scammer a chance to make it right. Because Moneypak works with the law, they can see who the money went to and such. I have a feeling I will get my money back, I have emails that show she took the $400 for 4 bitcoins and I can prove i never received them with that link w0ss4g3 provided (thanks!)  The ebay lady was very nice and imformative...wish me luck..-.- im a noob next time im gonna fork over a lil more cash and do it the right way...this is a pain in the a$$

thanks for the support, Its giving me hope. Because right now im kinda angry this happend...but its no ones fault but my own, live and learn i guess :D
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:23:55
Yes, I think it has something to do with the amount and that the person is a 100% feedback seller, We will find out though..Ill keep you all posted if you guys care..
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:18:36
what is this? 
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:36:32
thanks for that link, I just tried it. The mpack is 0.00$ balance. Hoe took the money...now its on...like donkey kong? Man i wish i had a N64....
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:16:27
Yes i did email her twice, and now a third time letting her know that ebay knows whats shes done and they are investigating it and they advised me to call he cops and ebay will help the cops with the fraud and I will hopefully receive most if not all of my money back...
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:31:02
or Lass, would work...no "BRO" here. Ive got a vagina and boobies, girrrlll
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:33:04
WEll, If anyone feels bad for me, you have my deposit address...just sayin....maybe ill show some boobies...o shit nvm there is a whole subreddit for that and the chicks do it for free.. god damnit...
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:47:43
I understand I made a mistake, only thing i can do now is try to fix it. Ebay will help the cops and vice versa, remember, you have to have a credit card/debit card to open a ebay account. so the money is somewhere...I just gotta do some due diligence and get it back....
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:25:42
also, i played dumb. Like i didnt know it wasn't ok to do outside sales and that sorta thing, I also have the receipt and mpack card showing that it was sent to her...so hopefully my "lack of ebay knowledge" will convince them im just dumb and deserve my money back :P 
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:18:54
moneypak, how i ususally pay, but this time i did it on ebay instead of SR, She had 100% feedback and sold/sells bitcoins on ebay..I dont know if i did something wrong, or if it just is taking a long time??
