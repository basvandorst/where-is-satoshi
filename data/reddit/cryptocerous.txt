Yup, just like stocks. Right? 
Cue the arguments about how we can't use any pricing models that are used for any other asset in the world because cryptocurrency is so special.

There's a certain level of incompetence, beyond which you can't really blame anyone but yourself, no matter how evil someone else is. Your friends went far beyond that.
If I tell you that it's a good idea to stab yourself with a knife now, it is a bit evil. But if you actually do something so obviously dumb just because I told you to, you deserve 100% of the blame for that.
Even worse if your friends put in money on that gamble that they weren't completely fine with entirely losing.

FYI - this instant confirmations + insurance seems to be exactly the service that companies like BlockCypher [seem to be preparing to offer](
I.e. using some predictive methods to near-instantly guarantee most zero-confirmation transactions. Presumably they'll soon offer a financial guarantee on top of that too, if there isn't already a company doing this.

Very normal practice for the developer to do, in contracting for website development. I've done the exact same thing to several non-paying clients in the past.
Perhaps there's much more to the story, but I'm inclined to guess that the developer did the right thing. Eastern Europe treats developers as low-status shit, has shit labor law rights. Not really surprised that this happens.

Sad to see. In my experience with 3 of the startups I've previously been involved in over the past decade, where there was a non-technical, extroverted, soft-skills-only cofounder -- 100% of the time this person eventually resorted to legal threats, blackmail, and public badmouthing as soon as the company ran into a period of major financial difficulties.
Such fucking predictable behavior.
Even though these soft-skills-only people obviously can bring publicity and business to the company in the beginning, I would never cofound a company with that type of person ever again. Nearly all startups of this type go through protracted tough times. It's a ticking time bomb, and not worth it for your mental health.

Knew it! Always suspected that my particular usage of commas is slowly exposing my identity across multiple accounts. My theory on this - no one really knows the official comma-usage rules, but they want to be consistent, so they make up their own comma rules and stick to those.
A few more features that I've wanted to experiment with for this task, that could add some extra confidence:
- Time-sequence patterns: Very typical for users to make a bunch of comments in one account, log out, make a bunch of comments in another - in a clear pattern of switching back and forth. Probably because people don't want to fool around with a bunch of browsers at once. It would require supervised data to train, but I'm sure there's something of value in this behavioral pattern.
- Hourly commenting patterns, by day of the week? I'm sure we all have certain hours of the day where we never comment. If those perfectly line up between suspected alt accounts...
- Seeing what other subreddits each account is posting on. A sockpuppet can't just post on one subreddit, or people will obviously recognize it as a sockpuppet. So the creator comments on a few other subreddits. E.g. Ryan Kennedy had an extremely obvious pattern for his alts. They were always going between dogecoin and the free karma subreddits.
- Username patterns. There are some good papers out there where spam domain names were separated from good domain names, by looking at features of the domain names. I'm sure the same could be applied to identifying sockpuppet reddit usernames to some degree.
A real nice use of this system would be to identify prolific cryptocurrency scammers like Ryan Kennedy, who use many alts, and are constantly writing huge passages of recognizable text.
Edit: 
For those commenting on this system being unsupervised - supervised training data could theoretically easily be obtained, with the admins' help.
What I did on my social network a few years back, when it was having terrible spam / sockpuppet problems, is to use something like: Evercookie + IP addresses + browser font fingerprinting + browser user agent tracking. But, just using Evercookie alone would be a good enough start. Then from the tracking history generated by that, build up a graph of connections between accounts that share any of those tracking features. The idea is that if the person doesn't defeat any one of those features, their cluster of sockpuppets is still successfully identified as one entity.
With this, you easily and suddenly get an extremely clear sample of high-confidence sockpuppets, with which to train your system in a supervised way.
