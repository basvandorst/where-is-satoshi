Problem is that it is possible to spoof gps coordinates.

I don't think Apple would ever start blocking websites in your web browser. Also if they blocked any term in the web browser you could simply change it.

I saw that jet too today. It was at the Mnt Home airshow in Idaho. It was also right next to the check in so a lot of people saw it today. 
Also the show is going tomorrow too. 
Edit: [Here]( is a picture I took.

If you encrypt your wallet file and back it up it will be safer from the threat of theft.

Isn't it a bad idea to put a large number of bitcoins into a single wallet like this?

Look up installing Debian/Ubuntu in a chroot. I have a script that I wrote that will mount my chroot image, and chroot into it. Once in the chroot I have a full Debian environment. I can run pretty much any Linux tool. I even have a X server I can VNC into. 
Here is some useful links.
 ( I have not used that. I made mine by hand. )

I heard about Bitcoin on the Security Now podcast. I tried mining on my laptop but never did more than a few hours worth. 
I got a free vps and had no real use of it so I put a cpu bitcoin miner on it. I made about .9 bitcoin on it. 
Then I bought .1 bitcoin for $2 so I could have 1 bitcoin which was the minimum for Mtgox. 
I cashed most of it out and made about $20.
Currently I have about $6 worth of bitcoins. 
I wish I would have keep them until recently. 
My story is boring sorry for wasting your time.

Last year I sold the 1btc i mined for $20. I wish I kept it. Also I wish I bought a bunch of bitcoins when they were $5.

The chroot is not slow at all. As far as I can tell it is native speed. I have never had it fail in any way so I don't know how it is unreliable. 
And I did the whole vnc thing just for fun.

I want one of those lasers things. I would etch so many random things.
