After seeing the visualization it makes sense. I assumed it was a high-fee-down queue as you said, but I didn't realize the volume simply dipped enough to include my transaction in the queue.

Not me, just got a 525 followed by a 520.

Well, I don't quite agree that 6 sat/byte is plenty for few-hours confirmation. If you look at the link Personthingman2 posted, there were many days where the mempool was full of way more high fees. For example if I had tried to make that same transaction anywhere from Nov 28-Dec 2 or so, it simply wouldn't have been confirmed. 
Propaganda is propaganda. Best thing we can do is look at the charts and lead by example.

So you are a fan of giving kids cyanide? That's what you're doing when you encourage kids to eat apples you know. That's either acceptable to you, and you want kids to be forced to eat cyanide, or it's not acceptable to you and you're in favor of nutrition evasion.

Apparently the fix is in sight, but it's coming soon(tm)

simply amazing

Ah this is a good resource. I can see that my fee of 6 sat/byte was in the red zone, and that zone gets eaten up when the transaction volume decreases lately.

Great info thanks

I realize there was no real point in me saying I sent $4 USD since the transaction size is the only important thing.

I have it on good authority that 0-100% of it will be gone by this afternoon.

Personally I've found that complaining to Apple about an unrelated Android app on Google Play doesn't get me very far.

A bitcoin address is actually more like HASH160(SHA(public key)) so you would need to crack those to get back to a public address, then work on cracking ECDSA to get a private key.
Although maybe somebody could clear this up: Does having HASH160 and SHA actually make it more secure? Since public keys are normally not exposed, there seems to be no need to find it if you were hacking an address. It's not computationally hard to go private key -&gt; public key -&gt; bitcoin address.

Hi! Curious, did you want to be paid in bitcoin because it's difficult to get bitcoin from cash in your area?

I don't see any option to deposit on my verified Quadriga account except Interac Online and wire transfer (minimum $50 000 CAD)
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:26:40
Sure send me some q's

Finally we have some new plot points for a few more James Bond movies.
@_date: 2011-06-22 15:58:45
Heh, their "we're not accepting deposits" notice isn't on the deposit page.. I sent an Interac transfer and canceled it once I realized. In fact it's pretty hard to find the info that they're not accepting deposits.
@_date: 2011-06-22 19:39:27
It's closed for deposits.
@_date: 2011-06-22 21:31:16
There's now a message on the deposit screen that they aren't accepting deposits, looks like Grady2000 listened to me haha.

This thread is so full of tinfoil it's starting to tune in radio stations. Considering nobody else has come forward with one of these damage notifications, it was either used because it was the easiest way to repackage it after inspection, or the agent was being nice and is giving you documentation to get a refund (or insurance). 
There's just no freaking way any sort of intelligence would peel off half of the seal, swap it out or modify it, and just hope the seal sticks again. That's ridiculous.
Let's say the big baddies have a stash of replacement myceliums ready for clandestine swappage. Why wouldn't they print new seals?
I buy circuit boards from overseas often. I'm in Canada too, and they're always "sent for further inspection", and when they arrived, they've been opened and re-taped. 
"Border Security: Canada's Front Line" on National Geographic Channel shows this sort of thing.

I'm actually talking to Grady on irc right now, maybe I can convince him.

I did a similar thing. I bought 2 BTC back when it was worth about $15, the first bubble. I put the wallet file on dropbox and forgot about the whole thing until I happened to read it was suddenly worth $265 (at the peak). Still got em though and I've been keeping up with all the bitcoin news ever since.
I even offer to accept bitcoin at these classic video game swap meets that I usually have a table at, but nobody's ever offered to buy with bitcoin unfortunately.
