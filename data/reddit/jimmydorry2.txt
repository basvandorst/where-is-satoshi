I am not aware of any way to make a contract without tieing up the coins or simply paying as required (probably making a new contract each time)... so you are making even less sense.

Again, everything I have read about payment channels has shown a design that locks up the coins you will eventually pay the service provider. Payment channels only look useful for microtransactions, something which cloudflare is obviously not selling.

1. I haven't seen any technical papers on it. There is no such thing as whitelisting people to withdraw from you, as you should be the only one able to spend from your wallet (private key).
2. I see you have completely missed the point. I am highlighting how it **_IS_** inconvenient **_BECAUSE_** there is no way to differentiate between those two concepts. Paying upfront or locking the coins away are the only options and both are inconvenient.

From what I am aware, those kind of schemes can only work if you like tieing up coins for the entire time of service...
By nature of the bitcoin protocol, you can't spend coins that you do not have which means that there is little difference between paying for your entire term at once, and putting the amount into some kind of contract that dribbles it out.

Anything bigger than the hammer, generally won't look like a nail.

Let's try inserting some jokes here:
KDC is so fat that each tweet he makes requires its own post.
 
 
 
 
 
 
That fell flat. :(

Recurring payments only work when you can pre-authorise withdrawls ... something probably not possible with bitcoin.

I would be part of the top 10% if not smaller than that. I believe the average data cap is around 50gb for residential usage, but I don't have any sources for that. 50GB/month is about $70/month.
The maximum upload should be around 1.5mbps across all of those plans, but realistically can be a lot less. This w
Things will probably change quite a bit in the coming years as our national fibre is rolled out... but the above has been the reality for the past few years.
My back of the hand calculations (which could be far off), suggest that 60GB of data over a month means a constant usage of about 0.2mbits of your bandwidth... which could have quite a significant affect on most residential connections.
EDIT: Here are some of the plans we are talking about:
Looks like there are some larger plans, but last I checked, all of the other providers combined have a smaller market share than the provider in that first picture... not to mention that those unlimited plans are far from unlimited. There are lots of hidden costs too, and all of those plans work out to similar total costs across ISPs on similar tiered plans.

It's far too expensive to run here.
The general response I got when mentioning this in the various threads about the upcoming change in block size was: "Suck it up or move to a better country"
When the choice is between living in Australia or running a full node... the choice is rather simple.

Nice clickbait title
@_date: 2015-03-19 13:18:16
Even that is clickbaity... But yea, I didn't think that worth mentioning.
Tl;dr changeTip has expressed their desire to go on chain, via sidechains or payment channel. They have apparently dedicated some resources for it, but thus far have nothing to show.

I don't particularly care about this issue, as I am a user and not currently a full node (too expensive so I stopped... thanks Australia)... but in the interest of discussion...
He is pointing out a future problem too.
If nations are currently struggling to maintain or increase the number of full nodes, it is not likely that this will turn around over-night.
Dismissing the issue is not going to make it go away.
@_date: 2015-03-19 00:51:03
Thanks. I think the happy ground that everyone wants (but is challenging to implement), is to give the node enough configurability that you can set a maximum bandwidth and a maximum data allowance for the month.
The combination of those two inputs would determine the max connections you make, or simply starts up and shuts down as required to not exceed the quota.
Targeting full nodes at the less advanced users is probably not going to change things too much, although it will probably be welcomed by all new node operators.
@_date: 2015-03-18 23:59:51
A typical internet connection can cost around $120/month for 200gb of data.
Nodes I have seen will typically use far more than 200GB and completely saturate your line, which will either mean a massive rate limit or huge usage costs when you breach your cap... depending on your ISP.
Blocks of data allowance in data centres can cost upwards of several dollars per GB, so you can't even go down a DC route.
Basically, we get screwed over on internet costs.

I'm part of the Beta, but haven't got my card yet. They just let us know it will take longer for it to be shipped.
Still excited though~

I would need to see how they cleaned up their act.
Last time I looked at them, there were some allegations that they kept a copy of your encryption keys on their servers, so they could de-duplicate data and remove works identified in violation of copy-write.
EDIT: A quick google and their terms of service indicate that do do data de-duplication.
@_date: 2015-02-26 22:58:53
No idea, as I haven't got it yet. I will have to assume yes, as I will be very disappointed if this is not the case.
