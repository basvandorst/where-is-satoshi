Government didn't save it, it wasn't under threat of failure.

I mean a stock rise in a company of 125% in 5 years is surprisingly actually pretty good

JPMorgan actually didn't require bailing out by the government because the financial crisis didn't hit them so hard because they invested relatively lower risk compared to other banks. You know, like not investing in super volatile currencies, which is what he's saying he's not gonna do.
 They were 'forcefully' given money by the government anyway.

JPMorgan did not need to be bailed out. They weren't as reliant on the subprime mortgage fiasco as all the other banks and although had less earnings preceding the event, it still posted a profit even during the crisis without government intervention. 
It was an exceptionally well run bank by Dimon to not have been under threat of failure. Government intervened with all banks however so they were given support loans by the government but it wasn't necessary for their survival.
