Big crash = everything in the economy losing value, making it a great time for those who have money. It means buying cheap and selling 10 years later for 10x more at least.
I believe that’s how it goes. The way it happens is companies closing, people losing their jobs thus not being able to pay their loans and consequently losing their homes to the bank. These banks now hold a ton of houses they can not liquidate because no one has money. This leads to smaller banks closing or being bought by the big banks. It’s a massive domino effect that indeed benefits the big banks.

As I said, everything in the economy loses value. Stocks are no different. Small companies can’t cope with that while big ones can. Companies close, property doesn’t. The way you make money is by buying property other people lost. Some guy kills himself because his company went bankrupt. His house will appreciate in value sooner or later no matter what.

That’s not what’s going on here. This is longs getting stop lossed. People open longs expecting price to go up and set a stop loss somewhere below the entry. As price plummets (probably orchestrated by exchanges), many panic sell closing at a loss while others hit their stop loss and get closed. As soon as that money is wiped out, buying pressure pushes the price a bit over what was previous to this action.

That’s why the small banks close down. Part of the question was “how do big banks profit?”. They profit by buying the small banks.
And yes, the company (bank) is doing bad, but if you’re big enough it doesn’t matter. You have plenty of liquidity, not only to survive, but also to buy every little guy’s assets on discount.
Dude, this is basic stuff. I’m no hotshot yet I’m waiting for a crash. I want someone to lose their home so I can buy it on discount myself. All those people who took loans just a tad bit higher than they should have gonna be fkd whenever it hits.

This probably means we’re headed down. You know how this market goes.
Owner of exchange tells everyone they’re soon going to be able to cash out millions from his platform. Yeah, right.
The purpose is, everyone opens longs, some use leverage, exchanges dump a ton thus tanking the price, margins get called, exchange takes everyone’s money. That’s how it goes, not the other way around.

The loss of purchasing power means some people will have to cut down costs. First thing people drop is internet. Housing, energy, and food are priorities. That’s for the common citizen.
Big money will probably stay put, back into lira since it’s so cheap now, or straight into gold.
Crypto is for 1st world countries, not for the Turkeys and Venezuelas.

Even though I would like to see the opposite, I fear we might still be in the grip of the bear. If that is the case the red line could be the bottom, give or take. But again, I’d like to see the opposite and enter a bull market like we had in 2016-17.

That’s how you lay the foundations for some solid FUD. Build exceptionally high expectations and then pull the rug from under everyone’s feet. This will be the final blow that will drive bitcoin to the bottom of this bear market.

Ouch... if we look at the previous parabolic bull run (2013) and at the most recent (2017)... there’s 4 years in between. But who knows what’s going to happen?

I think this whole ETF thing is just a big pile of bs laid out only to kick the price down when they say “oh we’re so sorry but it’s not happening”. And guess what? Everyone is falling for it. The thing is building up to massive proportions -everyone talks about it, every news outlet writes about it. It seems like it’s the only thing holding the price above 6k.
