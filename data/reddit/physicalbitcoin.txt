Just downloaded this, good UI and UX. I think it'll take off in a few months. 
The only thing I noticed it that it takes 5-10 secs to do a search (I'm on a slow connection) so it might be nice to read a quote, or BTC factoid, or something as you're waiting. 
The team have obviously put a lot of work into this so I hope you succeed. Good that you let it out open source too...

OK, but why did OP have to go public to get a resolution? He said you weren't answering his mails.

I think a simple site with a few functioning shops would help uptake a lot. After trialing the experience, people could migrate to the decentralized version. A lot of users are mistrustful and jaded about downloading an 80MB file before knowing what it is. 


I don't think centralized nodes/popular shopping hubs would be such a problem in Open Bazaar. AFAIK There's no way they could "control the network" so  I doubt many ppl would mind.

It's easy to be cynical but at least he's trying something. There will be other factions in London trying to derail BTC, but there are obviously some white hats in UK politics.

Why do OBers get defensive about feedback? Look at that drama over a typo pull request last week. Seeing the way the OB team deals with some comments might make people less enthusiastic about flagging errors. At least ppl are spending their time helping.

I just clicked, at least they made it look really good. The UI is 10x prettier than Ebay's. It takes time to code each of those features, I guess they'll get to them over the next few months. 
It would be good if they showed a demo of the buyer experience without having to download the app.

Steve Albini's article, "The Problem with Music" makes similar points. Large amounts of money upfront, which doesn't look so good once once you do the corporate math and factor in the freedom of decision making you gave up. 
2 Million USD is going through crowdfunding everyday. Maybe it's still the best way to get 10-50,000USD to fund a small team of programmers for a few months.  Not easy to do, but you stay independent. I know it's not easy to get 50,000USD from crowdfunding right now, but money flowing through Kickstarter and Pozible etc is increasing, so this route will be more and more viable as time goes on,

Forking is the natural way to deal with creative and political disputes. Bands, newspapers, companies, everyone does it. But in blockchain economics it becomes much harder.  What if forking endangers the original value and trust that has been built up? What if some blocks/coins are not recognized as "true bitcoins". We are maybe seeing that happening with classic/XT and other forks. Splitting off may have been ethically the right thing to do, but it's hard to get real world traction and recognition for these new protocols.
How would the consumer marketplace react to a fragmented bitcoin? It's a difficult puzzle, I wouldn't know how to solve it. Maybe one way forward is a protocol fork that recognizes both the "old style" blocks and the newer ones. I think SegWit is supposed to work with different types of blocks.
I don't like the excessively centralized structure right now, but getting out of this rut is a real tightrope walk. It's tough, but I'm sure someone will work out how to do it within a few months.
