They probably bought more guns and armor vests, so they can confiscate more. When you can tax people until death, why worry about investing?

I'm not in the market for any of those things, but your charity is not going unnoticed my friend! Keep up the philanthropy and surely you will be rewarded in the next life or next or maybe the one after that, or maybe not at all, but whatevs

Just finished this. Really good book. Put together well, with some nice commentary by the author.

newbie here: I want to buy my first BTC. I didn't really see a problem with linking my bank account to buy some (am I wrong?). I intended to send the BTC to the generic wallet on my phone after I had purchased it. Anything wrong with that idea?

I wonder if he found his name on the constitution where he consented to being governed. Back then you had to be a property owner, white and male to vote. We the people were a very small subset of the people of that time and none of us today.

The way I see it,
First: bitcoin entrepreneurs could take NY to court as this is a violation of the interstate commerce clause.
Second: Bringing them to court only legitimizes the idea that they should be able to regulate crypto currencies (and once they have their foot in the door, it's over. You know they won't play nice). So the optimal thing for a New York entrepreneur to do, is leave the state.

You do realize that this is just another Ideology right? How will you get your oil and refine it? Who will insure that BP doesn't drill on my land? How do I prove it is my land? Naaaah we don't need no stinkin govment... I wish it were true but not today.

I would access to the software just to, you know...review the code  (ok I want to get rich)

The lawyer could call a local news channel and likely get free publicity too, unless he is in a big city where there are already businesses taking bitcoin.

Thanks, I suspected as much.

I think bitcoin is highly illegal in Russia now. They had outlawed it before, then it was ok, and last I heard it's illegal again.

This seem like a great idea, but I doubt they would agree to this.
@_date: 2014-10-13 20:38:22
maybe the Internet is already sentient and created Satoshi to create bitcoin, to create revolution, to create terminators, to create.... oh you get the point.

5k... was a lot for me. I realize it wasn't smart but there is this effect where you become biased and all you pay attention to is the positive news. Next thing you know.... your all in baby!

Why pay? No one wants to read spoilers anyway. Even if the hackers made these free torrents, it wouldn't detract from the show, unless you read them and it spoils the show for you. By paying they guarantee further abuse.

My ex girlfriend thought it was pronounced "bitch coins". Her ex would watch cam girls and tip them with bitcoin, so she called them bitchcoins.
