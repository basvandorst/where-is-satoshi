This is not a good idea, I think, especially if you want to save for your kid's future.  210 bitcions amounts to about $210,000 at the current price and keeping it all in one single asset like bitcoin is very risky.    Who knows what will happen to bitcoin.  Some other cryptocurrency could come along and replace it between now and 2045 and your 210 bitcoins will go from ~$210,000 now to worthless.  Save maybe one or two bitcoins, sell the rest, and split the rest into a mix of stocks and bonds with half of the money going into a  tax exempt college savings account, and half going into a regular brokerage account.  Put 90% of the money in both accounts into stock index mutual funds and put 10% into short term bond mutual funds.  Balance every year or so to keep the 9:1 ratio between stocks and bonds.  When your kid is old enough, they will have enough money to go to college and live off of for a long time.

Wouldn't it be far less risky to dump half your money in gold?

Even if that were true, gold will probably still hold value 50 years from now.  I don't know if I could say the same thing about bitcoin.

Let's say the banks and US govt. are pure evil and Bitcoin is going to save the world.   If you had $5000 and wanted to buy some bitcoin to go off and save your village which is under attack by the bank monsters, you need to know the BTC/USD conversion rate or else some scammer could easily sell you Bitcoin at an inflated rate and make off like a bandit.
