good luck with that, the demand for bitcoin currently outweighs supply, which means its only going up until the end of the year, plus when you add in the difficulty explosion once asic arrives and the block halving in december

if you have encrypted it (with a decent password) then it will be useless to any hacker. also a hacked wouldn't "steal" it so much as copy it. a usb backup is a great idea, this is in case your mac gets stolen, hard drive dies etc. you can restore the wallet file, enter your password and access your coins again

personaly i consider paper wallets more for offline longterm storage. is there a padlock symbol in the bottom right hand corner of the client? if not you can set a password, (write it down this time). in the client, click file, encrypt.
This will encrypt a file called wallet.dat, this is where your private keys for your bitcoin addresses are stored, if this file is stolen and you havent encrypted it, you can be sure all any coins you had will be long gone.
once you have encrypted your wallet, shutdown the client and make a backup of said wallet.dat file

your pool has between 1.5-2.2 THash, while the total current network is around 1100-1300 THash.
On average your pool should find a block every 3.7days, that means you can get unluckly and that could fluctuate to 10 days(or even more) with ease.
Basically to avoid such variance, you should probably mine at a larger pool

story? what happened?

have a look at the current top post on the main page (of reddit)
or @_date: 2013-10-01 07:09:06
well i mine at BTCGuild, its currently the biggest pool, so the variance will be lowest. The problem with mining at a popular pool is its the # 1 target for DDoS attacks, (it was attacked for 12 hrs yesterday) so you got to have some backup pools ready
BTCGuild supports Namecoin merged mining so does BitMinter

From the Wiki:




* Prevent some or all transactions from gaining any confirmations
* Prevent some or all other miners from mining any valid blocks
So at the current network rate of 1500 TH/s they would need &gt;750TH/s, prohibitively expensive for an individual but for a government...
edit: you could buy 1500 TH/s form BFL with the new 600 GH cards for *only* $12million
