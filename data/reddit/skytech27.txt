some people actually enjoy primitive tech...we must remember that.
@_date: 2017-10-29 05:08:02

@_date: 2017-10-26 16:54:26

@_date: 2017-10-26 20:36:05
bear the full risk? no one would keep money in the banks.
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:18:35
why all the forks? gonna make everyone more nervous.
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:12:21
30 min transaction age impressive
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:28:00
not enough supply of bitcoin in the world so there would be some big issues quickly with transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:26:13
bitcoin will partner with the post office soon enough give it time.
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:37:48
anyone got a copy of the vid?
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:32:09

We like to think of Web Summit as the meeting place for the leaders of today and tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:29:38
Bank charges fee for wire. I dont think there is a way around this as long as you keep using bank wires/deposits.
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:01:29
altoins will run like never before? 
Lost the priv key? unlikely.
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:31:38
how long will it last?
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:00:44
the fees? with that type of return I wouldnt be concerned. Is he cashing it all or moving some into other coins?
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:10:57
Do I get a ride home?
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:04:07

@_date: 2017-10-28 22:56:52
purchase? should be holding with charts like this 
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:23:42
forks are dangerous these days.
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:35:06

radio has no future....they were somewhat right in that aspect.
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:24:37
everyone gets nervous with ideas of changes.
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:00:33

@_date: 2017-10-12 00:26:06
Your aunt is trying to give you back the inheritance as well? I sent the money order in last week to get the funds unlocked just waiting any day now.
@_date: 2017-10-11 10:42:52

@_date: 2017-10-26 17:38:18

@_date: 2017-10-26 22:13:13
File your taxes by the profit on cashout.

@_date: 2017-10-26 17:21:25
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:14:09
You need a good amount to be able to exchange it anywhere.
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:38:00
did you buy the kiosk or bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:02:52
coinbase is most secure however there could be some delays due to this. Instant is risky.
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:13:33
getting italy on board nice! 
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:54:32
