well the last inform from sudeban the institution that regulates banks here says that almost 69% of the people over 18 y/o thats around 19 million people in a country of 30 millions, 58% of those have 2 to 3, and that was on 2013, the thing is that bank accounts are almost compulsory for example the elderly have accounts created for them automatically once they start getting paid social security, most jobs are paid throught tranfers, here doesnt exist the mindset to reject traditional methods, and very few know about crypto, this is the apex of a conformist society. But that may be starting to change, i for example have one of my pcs mining monero, and sell in game currency and get pay more than minimum wage, is a weird universe down here.
Btw source:  banesco is one of the biggest private banks of the country and the prefered one for those that deal in USD and crypto, you can check the VEF section of localbitcoins to see how predominant it is.
