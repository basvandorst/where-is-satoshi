I asked for any form of proof that it would actually work, whether it be proof in a real world setting or just a proof of concept in a lab. Right now SW, IBLT, LN, and everything else you talked about has absolutely no proof of any kind that it will work, and you dishonestly stated that a signed proposal is a form of proof. Then you dishonestly characterized my request for at least a working proof as if I requested a final, absolute proof.
Also, testnet is not like working in a lab. In a lab you control every factor of the experiment. Testnet is a public beta testing platform for bitcoin code. Variables on it are not controlled by the experimenter or by anybody, nor are they controllable.

We've had similar "stress tests" where the mempool grew to over 100k transactions in queue. People were waiting over 24 hours for a confirmation and many were dropped completely even though they had a high fee (greater than 0.0001BTC). There were many users, especially new ones, coming on here and complaining about how horrible the system was working at the time. They all said that needing to send another transaction with an even higher fee just to ensure that it is processed was a huge pain in the neck and the whole situation was stress-inducing for them.

That's a horrible straw man. It has been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that the 8MB increase will force almost none of the nodes offline. Miners, node operators, users, developers, and just about everybody in this space wants this to happen and therefore it will. That is how consensus works. Centralization will occur if we don't increase the blocksize significantly.

Even if you believe that to be true then it is still in your best interest to encourage both yourself and everybody around you in believing that transactions are not free. We absolutely must have a miner's fee if we want the network to continue operating for the next century or more. Any other mode of funding would impossible if we want bitcoin to remain completely permissionless.
And, just for the record, I don't believe what you are saying is true. Perhaps a year ago it would still work without any fee and be fast, but today that is not possible.
@_date: 2015-12-24 19:56:14
Testnet trials were done with BitcoinXT and 8MB blocks. They found that the network could have serious trouble if we went straight to 8MB blocks and a 3-4MB range would work almost exactly as well as 1MB blocks. 2MB is extremely safe territory and it is a shame on the developers who are fighting against implementing it at this time.

The worst part is that this year will be the second biggest halving event **in the entire history, and future, of the bitcoin network.**

Then feel the anger ignite your very soul as "bitcoin" developers respond with lies such as, "Well, the network can't *really* handle 2MB blocks right now." 
Next year is shaping up to be quite the shit show.

BTCC just added 100 more nodes to the network and Coinbase has been running nodes for their entire existence. No exchange, payment processor, or coin vendor is ever going to trust a third party node for their queries and record keeping. Perhaps most businesses will, such as pizza places and bike shops, but a chunk of the industry with mountains of money behind it will be running nodes for the life span of the network.

Then you go on further and attempt to gaslight me into believing that my perfectly rational request for a working proof is laughable and that I'm a joke for asking for anything more than a dev's signature.

These big banks have been in their respective business much longer than Blockbuster. Think about it this way; Was Blockbuster in the business of renting out small leisure equipment items to retail consumers for 200 years before VHS tapes came along? No, they weren't, but some of these banks have been in the business of processing payments and managing investment networks for centuries. There is your difference and a clear sign that we should not underestimate the competition.

They wouldn't really be what you call a bitcoin miner but more like a bitcoin "miner."

Miners of bitcoin would never dream of doing any such thing, but "miners" of bitcoin would.

Bitcoin and cryptocurrency at large may both fail and never be talked about again in a few years, but to imagine, for even one second, that human beings, a species around the world involved in international trade for thousands of years using precious metals as money, would not be able to come to a decentralized agreement about whether or not gold and silver are money is beyond my capacity to misinterpret reality. We know that if the network effect gets strong enough then bitcoin will be used for major worldwide commerce and without any authority deeming what is and is not BTC. With gold, you can melt it down, check the density, and the universe itself determines if your gold counts as money or not. Bitcoin is merely the mechanism by which this property will finally be transferred into digital form so that we can, essentially, teleport money instantly and verify it by "melting down" all of the inputs and outputs on the blockchain.

I've noticed that you've been hellbent on telling people that a block size increase would cause significant centralization problems, and with 20MB, which I used to support early on in the debate, it possibly could be a problem. With 8MB blocks this isn't even a question. There is no problem. Even with LN we need bigger blocks to scale up to billions of on-chain users. Do you still rally against any increase, or have you compromised somewhat? Specifically, how do you now feel about the proposed 8MB size?

GHash deserves to die. They tried convincing every single bitcoiner in the world to "just trust us" and everything would work out just great. This is where people like me spring into action by calling out their extremely obvious manipulation tactics. See, no matter how little I know about the technical aspects of the network, the one thing I am extremely good at is telling when a person is being disingenuous or disobeying basic logical framework. It's so hilarious to me when an engineer uses a smattering of unrelated technical details in order to obscure their true motive. You don't even need to know a single line of programming code to be a massive help in the development of bitcoin. Just always keep in mind the code of deductive logic and you'll be a weapon against liars and manipulators.

Every new bitcoin user is going to be buying coins with zero bitcoin days and they will be transferring those coins back and forth from their wallet to try them out a very short time after getting them. They are unlikely to buy large amounts at first and even less likely to make large value transactions when they are first learning to use bitcoin. 
You are taking a fringe use case and characterizing the entire network in a way that will surely cause resentment when new users find out that it in no way applies to their newly bought, small stash of coins. The only correct thing to say to them is that the network requires the use of a miner's fee except in a few rare scenarios that they won't be encountering for a very long time, if they ever do.

I think we are in the same boat and the conflict of interest that has arisen a few times during this debate with companies like BS and others has been very telling. Surely there will be many, many more spinsters and scammers to come in the future, especially when and if the governments around the world begin dedicating billions to stop us from succeeding. The fact of the matter is that until we get some perfect LN setup that can scale to 10 billion daily users, then we simply must continue increasing the block size with increases in technology. There is not a single reason not to do this, whether you want to argue if the nodes can handle 8MB or 20MB, the fact is the they can handle more than they currently are doing, a lot more, right at this very moment, and we need to be taking advantage of that.
This is one of those situations where it annoys the hell out of me when idiots suggest that ONLY developers, programmers, and people involved in making bitcoin products should have their voices heard in these debates. While I may not be able to code more than simple html, I can spot a scammer almost anywhere. We need every set of genuine bitcoiner eyes to look over as many of these problems as possible, even if they have little to no understanding of the precise mechanics involved. If we fail at doing this, then we will eventually be overtaken from the inside because the programmers and engineers are not all experts in the ways of spotting a shill or shutting down a provocateur. In fact, I'd venture to say, after seeing what has happened on this current issue, that most of them are downright terrible at these things.

Price manipulation is rampant in the bitcoin markets at the moment. The idea is that once we get enough people using bitcoin, then nobody will be able to manipulate the price in any significant way. One person's bots will be culled by another, and so forth. If we reach the ultimate goal of eliminating all government issued currency and becoming the only form of money used around the world, then nobody will ever be able to manipulate the price again, at all, unless we stop using bitcoin or a competitor takes over.

There is absolutely no way for anybody to know that. At any time there could be a wave of new applications and users. Software moves quickly and there could easily be a few million people wanting to begin using bitcoin in the next few months. Right now we have very little headroom for that scenario.
We can wish upon a lucky star that lightning or something similar surfaces in time to meet these new users with a fast and stable network, or we can be rushing to deploy updates and trouble shoot errors caused by bigger blocks while millions of new users are finding out that this network isn't always that fast or that stable. The alternative option is we just do the increase now, trouble shoot any problems that occur, and then happily greet our new fellow bitcoiners as we continue to work on the lightning network and other solutions without all the stress.
Among all of this debate it seems that simple task management is often ignored.

On the application side of things, reddit is far more complicated to use than bitcoin. Keeping track of whom is replying to who, learning all the memes, understanding the voting process and how to make sure your comments don't get instantly buried, and the general and technical formatting of posts can actually be quite daunting. 
On the other end of the spectrum, you sign up for localbitcoins.com using your email address just like you would with any website and you can instantly buy coins with bank transfers, cash, or whatever method with which you which are already familiar. Spending the coins is a matter downloading a smart phone app. None of these things are complicated at all to the average person in today's world. The thing people get so confused about is that bitcoin is money which has absolutely no true physical form of any kind, and this is something that they really shouldn't think about.

And, just for the record, I think we should have bi-annual increases of 50%, not annual increases. The amount is subject to change.

Some small number of nodes would need to upgrade their hard disk and RAM. Some nodes wouldn't be able to keep up due to data capping from their ISP, and a very small number wouldn't have the bandwidth to keep up. The upgrades would be very cheap as 1TB of storage space is $25 and a RAM upgrade would cost a similar amount. It really doesn't take much power or space even at 20MB, but the data cap might be a killer for some nodes. It is likely that the vast majority of nodes would have no problem even with full blocks.
What everybody should consider is that node operators usually have good broadband internet and lots of spare computer parts sitting around. These nodes are not being operated out of small villages in Nigeria and Thailand, but, for the most part, they are operated by individuals living in 1st World countries who do computing as a hobby. Most of them probably have an old 1TB drive just sitting around on a shelf somewhere. We will see some nodes go offline, but it will only be a small fraction and not anything to worry about in terms of centralization. 
A much bigger problem would be if some amazing new app came out this month and we suddenly had 5 million people wanting to use the blockchain. If we wait until that point and try to play catch up by deploying the block size increase at the same time, the result could be 5 million people all over the world simultaneously talking to their friends and family about the unreliability of bitcoin. That would be a complete nightmare that we could avoid if we did the 20MB increase now.

It took the NSA, CIA, and FBI working together over more than a year before they could get the identity and addresses of a few, just a few, of the Silk Road admins but, hey, according to you anything can be hacked, therefore drug gangs would have been able to uncover all of the addresses of the thousands of dealers on the Silk Road by hiring underground hackers, even though the addresses of the admins were acquired by a federal investigation and infiltration operation and not by hacking.

Just place a "&amp;t=NNmNNs" at the end of the URL knowing that NN is any double digit number and m is minutes while s is seconds. Most people don't like watching a video longer than 5 minutes, and we often will use the timestamp code on youtube to cut down the viewing time of long videos.

I was not saying Greece was in any way similar to other countries. My examples of "poverty" were chosen so as to be extreme and not allow for further mincing of words. The person living in a mud hut without any electricity, car, hospital, road, or telephone has just as much of a chance at being happy as the billionaire who has it all and a trophy spouse to boot. Whatever any people want for themselves to call happiness is up to them to decide, and it has been my experience that the more money a person has the more miserable they are truly are.
It is different everywhere, but we so often have guilt-trippers from the upper classes that go around pointing at these people who live in mud huts and saying, "Oh no! Look how bad they have it over there! We need to do something to change their lives." This attitude sickens me to no end. It is cultural imperialism and is almost always carried out by the very same people who invented that overused term, these so-called "progressive academics."

I enjoy world financial news on here even if it isn't directly related to bitcoin.

The same goes for Rand Paul and other political candidates who begin accepting bitcoin. Once we start getting politicians to support bitcoin ubiquitously then we can stop posting those threads about them.

Because raising the blocksize limit and every idea on that proposal have absolutely nothing to do with each other. The two issues are completely separated but the borderline between the two is being obfuscated as if it were two opposing sides. 
We are sitting on a ticking timebomb of explosive growth and have no idea of when it might go off. We are not looking for a 2x, 4x, or any particular size in scaling the transactional capacity. If it doesn't significantly damage the properties of the network which give it value, such as permissionlessness or decentralization, then the change should be done immediately with absolutely no regard given to increases coming from other options.

It looks like *somebody* has never heard of Rapa Nui (Easter Island) before. Their population was once well over 3,000 until they started getting too greedy and exploited their natural resources, and then it fell by 97% to just 113 inhabitants. Today the natives of the island live in absolute peace with eachother and their government, unlike during the time of overpopulation where everybody was fighting and manipulating their way towards superficial wealth.
I suspect that the same turn of events is coming for the rest of the world sooner rather than later. Nature doesn't joke around, and that is a very, very good thing in the long run. Infinitely better to lose 97% than to lose all. It is in her fury where planet Earth is most merciful.

Key facts:
* Bitcoin offers a lower cost alternative to established banking and money transfer systems
* The particular characteristics of Bitcoin make it an attractive target for cyber attack and therefore, the security risk will never be reduced to zero. The establishment of recognised security standards for Bitcoin storage would greatly assist risk management and the provision of insurance
* It is essential for the long term viability of Bitcoin that it does not become synonymous with crime. The Bitcoin community should co-operate with law enforcement agencies to prevent exploitation by criminal networks
* Insurance can be a key component of responsible risk management to enable the next phase of Bitcoin’s evolution.

You are absolutely correct on that point. With blocks kept at 1MB bitcoin will never be ready for mass adoption, even if you assume that Lightning, Seg Wit, and 100% of the other scaling measures succeed at accomplishing everything of which they are theoretically capable. 
Keeping blocks at 1MB for as long as possible would be the easiest way to slow development of the network. We don't need to keep covering the same ground over and over again.

If somebody could design a system for storing research papers and journals on a decentralized ledger system, something like a sidechain that uses some of the ideas from StorjCoin, then that would be an amazing improvement in the field. Currently, access to these documents is restricted from the general public even though our tax money is used to pay for the research. This is criminal and needs to change. We all own that information and should have equal access to it. If the only way to that is through bitcoin, then all the better in my humble opinion.

All of the options you've mentioned are still very much theoretical at this point, both in capacity for scaling and workability. There might only be a marginal gain in transactional throughput and the technical glitches/bugs/unforeseen consequences could turn into quite the nightmare for anybody developing products that operate on the bitcoin blockchain. If they are ever proven to effectively scale bitcoin then of course that would change the blocksize requirement for LN proportionally. 
So let us assume that they all work well beyond the most optimistic fantasies available. Perhaps they will make a combined effect of reducing the blocksize requirement for a worldwide LN down to just 1% of the original figure. This just leaves us with one simple query: At what point in time will internet and computer technology be advanced enough to sustain a decentralized bitcoin network that has been converted to a 1.33MB blocksize limit?
That is not a rhetorical question.

With paper gold, you can never be sure that the vault has your holdings secured on the other end. With bitcoin, it takes two seconds and a cost of pennies to verify that the entire stockpile is intact and pure 100% bitcoin.
By "existing systems" I am guessing you meant legacy trading systems vs. bitcoin trading systems, and so I thought gold would be the best comparison, but you can substitute any other commodity for gold if you want and the result is exactly the same.

You should never allow for such a scenario. We need to make every effort possible to stay on top of potentially network breaking situations before they have any solid chances at happening. This is why we need to start rolling out the blocksize increase right now, because then we would be able to bring on a couple million new users in a single day, and with the EUR possibly failing next year, we cannot wait any longer for 8MB.
@_date: 2015-06-27 14:18:40
Something that doesn't exist cannot have a toxic effect. We absolutely must have both the LN and a significant blocksize increase if bitcoin is ever going to be capable of serving the World's financial needs. There is no debate left to be had on this issue and the increase will be coming soon no matter how many blowhards want to continue making convoluted and logically-deficient noise about it.

This is the only one that I can support. Adding a dynamic block size is a horrible idea. When building anything, be it a physical machine or a piece of software, one should always endeavor to keep the mechanisms as simple as possible with few moving or dynamic parts. This is why cars don't have a 5th wheel or a second gear for reverse. Dynamic blocks yield no useful advantage over scheduled size increases and will be very vulnerable to manipulation. I've no doubt that new attacks on the network are being planned for this right now and not being discussed on any bitcoin forum. 
TL;DR Go with the option that is the most elegant and simple; Increase the hard cap at a set rate over time.

I remember those load times. Myspace allowed any user to post music on each photo of the website, so when you checked out a friend's picture it would also load a dozen or more songs that would all play simultaneously. The sound volume would usually blow you back a couple of inches, that is if you waited a minute or two for the page to finish loading. 
This is similar to what will happen to bitcoin if the user activity suddenly grows by triple or quadruple what it is right now. Not only will the consumer side of things slow to a grinding halt, taking hours for a confirmation during busy times, but the effect this will have on the other experimental projects in the ecosystem, like the NASDAQ private equities test market, could turn large institutions away from this "unstable" network. When you say that the average confirmation time is ten minutes with X amount of average variance, and then the network goes several times beyond that level of variance, any sensible person would go looking for a different solution to their problem. 
If we go to 8MB then we can serve eight times as many users as we can right now, and the nodes can handle it. The network is running silky smooth at the moment and nobody can tell when the next wave of users will roll in. Let's get this done now and be prepared for that inevitable wave before it hits us.

[This post]( has some information on what has happened with times where the blockchain has forked before. One time it went off without a hitch and another time it forked accidentally (not sure how this happens) and lasted for some time causing issues. Trying to predict this is like weather forecasting. There are just too many moving parts of which to keep track. That is why I'm hoping we can start this hard fork while the network is not busy and in the public spotlight constantly like it was at the end of 2013. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 01:11:03

* 5. A simple increase in block size up to X amount followed by a timed increase of Y% each year.
This offers continued growth with no increased chance of manipulation from the miners and no necessary hard forks related to block sizes in the near future. If we just raise it to a set limit then we are setting ourselves up for another hard fork and if we give it an elastic limit then somebody will find a way to exploit that.

A normal CPU, which I am absolutely sure is to what they are referring, can do about 5MH/s. One of these so-called quantum computers would thus be around 500TH/s, or about 0.1% of the bitcoin net hashrate.

Or you can [look at the actual metric data]( and then compare it to the usual amount of headroom that a reliable payment network needs in order to function. Experts in the payments industry would advise you that such a low-headroom network is quite impotent, indeed.
And the notion about proof in a court of law being a fair comparison to a proof-of-work algorithm is incorrect. Any of the options you mentioned will only be proven as scalability solutions when we see the increase in tps either on a testnet (proof of concept) or on the bitcoin blockchain (concept to reality). At this point you don't even have a proof of concept working and you think that what you do have (proposal of concept) is "proof." Do you normally bend words this far to "win" an argument?

Sorry to have to say this, but the relatively small number of users is actually a good thing for bitcoin. At this point, the network cannot handle the volume of transactions it would need to service billions of people. We need to increase the amount of transactions that can go through the blockchain or else we just end up with a very low volume market and high fees that caters to the big banks and corporations just like the current financial system. If everybody jumped into bitcoin right now and started making transactions from their wallet then the network would completely crash. The transaction queue would continue growing forever and you would be waiting years instead of minutes for a confirmation. That would be a very bad thing for bitcoin.

There is a little market on the edge of town that you really like. It is the only place in the entire country where you can buy your favorite flavor of ice cream, but you have to drive through an area with a high crime rate in order to get to that special little market.

I see you are a person who feels that not all suffering is equal. You ought to read the book Candide by Voltaire and pay attention to the tale that the Pope's daughter tells to Cunegonde (don't worry, it is a very short book). The preconditions to suffering do not make the suffering itself any more bad or good. It is not more of a tragedy if a person of royalty is shot and killed, and it is also not more of a tragedy when a poor person is shot and killed. It would behoove you to refresh this concept in your mind before proceeding. 
That being said, I could use your argument and say that you care not for black and latino children that live in neighborhoods where drug-related gang violence kills hundreds of people each year, many of them not even involved in the trade. By your own logic, you do not care about these kids' lives. Silk Road made street dealing obsolete for many people, and certainly prevented some of the violence associated with it from happening.
You are condemning people who are helping to stop violent acts occuring because you think they were stopping it for the wrong people based on conditions of birth. I'd say you are a massive bigot unless you correct your argument and say that all lives matter equally, which at this point you are clearly saying that they don't.

It might have something to do with the uncertainty of bugs in the newer versions. If a critical error started occuring in all nodes running v0.9.0 and above, then we would need to have some nodes running v0.8.0 to rely upon while the other nodes are being reverted to the older version.

If you are reliably bumping up against the transaction limit then the problem already exists. We currently have something that needs to dealt with before the next inevitable influx of new users, not afterward, and for all we know that could happen next month. Some core devs seem to think that the world is just going to sit and wait until lightning is working in 2 years. That is a pointless gamble. We can certainly afford to lose a small fraction of our decentraliztion for the short-term, but we may not be able to afford a massive congestion of the network rendering services for millions of new users slow and unreliable.

There are two main ways to store the 12 word seed off of a computer. One is by writing or printing it on paper, called a paper wallet, and the other is by holding the twelve words in your memory, called a brain wallet.
Search on youtube for techniques to memorize a list of words. One popular method is memorizing a story using the twelve words. Just try to think of something related to the words that comes from your personal life, or that you can make a personal connection to in some way. Some people draw pictures to help them memorize the seed or to help them recreate it through a process of elimination. 
Probably the most important thing to consider, no matter the technique that you use, is to practice with smaller stored amounts at first. Just put a fraction of a bitcoin in a brain wallet and see if you can remember how to get it out tomorrow. Then maybe try a bigger fraction the next day. Keep a written backup of the 12 words just in case your memorization technique does not work. It is really just like any other tool. You shouldn't buy a Trezor and instantly store 20BTC on it the first day. Start small and work your way up as confidence and mastery of the tool improves.

The current block, in terms of your wallet, is the last block that was mined, not a new block that is being mined for right now, and therefore it is completed and not at all "fuzzy." Your wallet software doesn't download what could be called "incomplete blocks", if that is what you meant by it. Every other wallet in the network agrees that you received a bitcoin because the last mined block recorded the transaction in the blockchain.

OP was implying a flood of transactions such as the daily NASDAQ trading volume. They do something like 2 million transactions every 8 hours. 20MB would barely be able to handle NASDAQ alone, and that doesn't include the fact that trades happen at an uneven pace, where one hour of trading might be super busy and the next hour very slow, which would throw huge delays into the confirmation times during the busy hours. Then there would be everybody else using the clogged network who would have to just deal with the mess that the trades were causing. Even if we get Lightning and sidechains running, we will still need 20MB blocks but for different reasons.

They will continue running their own full database as a backup for the foreseeable future, and over time the amount of redundancy they need built into their system will be reduced. Once every TV and toaster has a miner built-in and billions of people have bitcoin wallets, then they can shut down those operations permanently and their redundant backup will be nothing more than a copy of the blockchain.

They are using the bitcoin blockchain. As I understand it, the technique they are employing is colored coins, so each trade is an actual transaction on the blockchain, not just a hashed record for all of the trades. Keep in mind that this experiment is not for all of NASDAQ, but just a small, low volume subset of their exchange where the accounting costs to a 3rd party clearing house will be reduced or eliminated. They will have to use a different method of verifying trades if they want to run their entire exchange using the blockchain, which would likely be something similar to Factom.
TL;DR Yes, the NASDAQ exchange is experimenting with actual bitcoin for some of their database work.

The trend clearly shows we are approaching that point soon and we have little headroom for new users as it is now. It would be best to have the opposite of this scenario at all times, where the capability of the network far exceeds the every day demand and is capable of handling an increase of activity by at least one order of magnitude. We need to do this until bitcoin is the universal currency. Then we will know that a huge influx of new users will not likely happen and the headroom for transaction capacity can be smaller.

The best advice I can think of is, like with any other tool, start out with a small amount. Buy and store less than one coin at first. Tip a little and make a few purchases online or in real life. Let the amount of confidence you have in the technology grow naturally as you use it. Your own personal sense of confidence is what should dictate how much more you buy/store/use bitcoin. Don't let somebody else tell you how confident they are using a Trezor and think that you can just run out and throw a bunch of BTC on it. 
Everything you do with bitcoin, for now, should be done in tiny, incremental steps. OP seems to have started out in this way with a simple standard wallet, which is great for a novice user to begin getting familiar. Often times, when dealing with completely new technology, we get caught up in the excitement and forget the basic practices of caution and taking things slowly.

When people stop driving through "violent ghettos" to get drugs then all of the drug-related violence will be reduced. It is just amazing how this judge only sees the situation as something like "rich white college frat boys will be helped out in having safer cocaine keg parties" instead of the reality that is "neighborhoods with mostly poor minority members will have drug-related violence dramatically reduced." 
It's as if the judge is somehow so irked by the fact that people who *might* not be desperately poor would have their safety increased on keg party weekends that the judge completely overlooks the fact that reducing drug sales in the "violent ghettos" by doing them online will invariably reduce gang activity and, thus, reduce violence for a poor neighborhood, something which they have to deal with every day and not just on keg party weekends. I can think of only one reason a rational human being would overlook such a massive benefit to both groups, and that would be because she is biased. In this case, it is painfully easy to see which way that goes.

We could have the lightning network operational within a couple years and, with 21MB blocks, that can handle enough traffic for more than a billion users. Right now the network is not even capable of effectively handling one million daily users. There is no way for us to project 20 years into the future what these number might be, and it is best to not set up such an expectation with so little foreknowledge. To set the standard of what constitutes excessive growth for the next two decades is, frankly, just a horrifying proposition.
Just put this into perspective for a moment. What technology ever had the capacity or functionality of it increased by 1000x in two years? That doesn't really follow Moore's Law at all, and it is not a good metric to use in this case. There is also a moral concern in that setting future hard limits now will limit how much we are able to help people. If we have the technology ready for a billion people to use the network and get out of government inflation or remittance fees, then we should put it to use immediately. You can't put a cap on the progress of something which could impact the welfare of people.

"Among the issues presented by Forde is the fact that, under the current guidelines, bitcoin companies operating in New York would need to have all app updates approved." - Coindesk
In plain English, it means that the department of financial services, which is controlled by the banks through lobbying and other methods, would have total control over the software people can use to run legal bitcoin businesses and would allow indirect control of how the bitcoin protocol is used, which is effectively the same as controlling the protocol itself.

You don't understand the implication here. All of those nodes would need the bandwidth and storage capacity for 100MB blocks, and all of that would need to be paid for by 21 inc for them just to operate. There would be nobody else on the network willing to pay those costs at present, and this would no doubt sink the company. The network can only be efficient if the costs are the responsibility of competing entities, otherwise it would be shut down the moment that 21 inc goes out of business. Then the entire bitcoin network would have to be rebuilt from the ground up. That would not be good.

I don't think calling them bits will help much, to be honest. When you tell people that bitcoin is currently being used for database purposes by the NASDAQ exchange, one of two things will happen; They will let this information correctly impact their view on bitcoin in a very positive way, if they are knowledgeable and forward-thinking about global finance, or they will incorrectly not let this information have any impact on their view.
Don't worry about appealing to or fooling Joe the plumber into thinking bitcoin is good. When he talks to John the broker, whom Joe trusts as a real expert on finances and fintech, it will take just a couple of sentences for Joe's opinion on bitcoin to transform for better or worse.

 I can tell you are talking about the US Marshals, but it helps to be more specific when posting. They haven't announced when the final auction will be held. With prices still in a downtrend and the other auctions happening with no problems, then I would guess they will do the auction as soon as possible to maximize profit. Summer or Autumn seems very likely.

You just told the entire world one of your wallet addresses and the number of coins you own at that address. Considering the amount is around $100k, I'd say that was a very unwise statement to make, especially on reddit. You should at least delete your comment, and possibly tumble the coins.

I guess we have to put this into perspective. Acid tests for gold are very costly, as far as both time and money, and the only way to ensure total purity of gold is a complete meltdown of all the metal. Within an hour, with zero additional cost after the original transaction fee (which is pennies at most), you can be absolutely sure that your transfer of bitcoin will not possibly be fake.
Also, transaction times are not equal to confirmation times. Check out how long it takes for Paypal or Visa to fully confirm a payment. Keep in mind, the transaction time is confirmed within seconds for Bitcoin, Visa, and Paypal, and then think about the previous points.

Programmable money means that you can tell your money to do things when you want. For example, an Uber driver could accept a payment in bitcoin that is linked to the GPS in the car. Upon reaching the desired destination, the payment would be automatically completed without any input from an external source. When the payment-on-destination is automatically carried out via a program embedded in the money itself, it would be impossible for anybody to charge for a feature that can be executed for free.
This same idea could apply to virtually anything. Executions of a living will upon death. Payment upon completion of product delivery scan from FedEx or UPS. Even payment of salary carried out on payday without the need for a company clerk or accounting department.
Most importantly, do keep in mind that this idea of "payment upon some completed action or timestamp" is just one of an infinite possible ways which money can be programmed to be more useful and cut out fees from the now useless middlemen of the world. Anything that can be formulated into an if/then statement can be attached to a transfer of money using cryptocurrency.

The response time of the bitcoin community and the miners nullified the strength of the time when billions of coins were created with the exploit.

Jersey, an island nation, is the localtion of the exchange that launched GABI, a bitcoin-backed trading fund, in August 2014, not to be confused with the National Stock Exchange (NSX) based in Jersey City, New Jersey that stopped trading in May of the same year. Sorry for the mix-up on that one.

His first proposal was unanimously rejected by our community, and rightfully so, but that was likely just him posturing up for the banks in the short term. He certainly doesn't want to be remembered as the man who cut NY off from the future of finance, and so he is likely to reverse some of his positions in a political strategy that will allow him to go against the wishes of some very powerful entities and make a good name for himself in history.

The Bitcoin Bowl was much, much bigger than the Dogecar. Dozens of businesses around St. Petersburg, FL signed up with Bitpay specifically because of this one event, it was nationally televised, the bitcoin logo wasn't just on the side of a car, it was covering the entire field and featured on the banner for the stadium and TV broadcast. You couldn't possibly have promoted bitcoin more at that event, and a ton of people watched that game. 
The result was that most of the businesses did little to no bitcoin sales at all, even on game day. Several of them decided to quit using bitcoin afterwards, and the response was so tepid from the football fans that Bitpay won't be doing it again next year. I hate to say this, but we are going to need some awesome thing, not just an awesome message, in order for bitcoin to gain momentum. PR and advertising will absolutely not work at all. The only thing that will make bitcoin succeed is an application that is built using it and that can only be built with bitcoin.
Look at it this way. We are going up against Mastercard and Visa. Compared to us, they have infinite advertising and PR resources that we can't even imagine. They can buy not just Superbowl ads but also congress. We can never beat their manufactured appeal, but we have something of which they could never dream: the best financial invention since gold. This is our one and only strength against the established payment channels and banks, and only by improving this invention can we succeed.
When bitcoin gets bigger, much bigger, then we need to put serious effort into advertising. Before then everybody will think we are trying to sell them snake oil because billions of dollars worth of ads from Mastercard and Chase told them so.

We are all skeptical of such claims. Will the central banks continue to survive? Perhaps, but the unlimited control they have over monetary policy would be put to an end. What happened to Mt.Gox would have happened to the vast majority of Wall Street if the Fed wasn't able to print money and erase their balance sheet at will. 
The difference with bitcoin would be that a failure to run a fractional reserve system would result in a massive penalty, perhaps bankrupting all institutions and individuals involved. Sure, anybody can still attempt to run such a system, but they won't be able to get (bribe) Yellen &amp; Friends to bail them out if bitcoin replaces the USD as a reserve currency.

Bitcoin is the ultimate reserve currency. Even if banks use it in their fractional reserve schemes, there is absolutely no way they can control access to bitcoin itself. On the other hand, banks have absolute control of when fiat currency is created and where it flows. Of course they can always make a sidechain or blockchain of their own, but the question remains as to who is going to use it. It is hard to imagine that any coin they create will retain any value against bitcoin, even in the very short term.

According to his own article, Simon Black is just another ignoramus who has no idea how the technology works.






1. 30GB is not a large file in today's world of multi-terabyte drives and 100GB blu-ray discs
2. Even at 1TB, the size of the blockchain has absolutely no effect on how fast transactions occur across the network.
3. Confusing confirmation times with transaction times.
4. The size of the blockchain does not, in any way, determine how much computing power is required to operate the network. 
5. Bitcoin could be run on a single CPU even if the blockchain was in the exabytes range.

Read the original post I responded to which is quoted here: 


Poster had claimed that the investment money of 21 should have been wasted on raising the block limit to ridiculously high capacity, the cost of which would have sunk the company and produced zero revenue. Had this actually happened, and the network depended on those 100MB nodes, then the entire network would fail the instant that 21 inevitably went out of business. It seems like my statement is being greatly misinterpreted as denouncing the idea of ever creating a 100MB node. I am 100% for the eventual creation of 100MB nodes and 100% against the idea that 21 inc should be spending their money to do that right now or in the near future.

Not liquid enough? The entirety of bitcoin is currently worth about as much as the USA wastes on a single aircraft carrier.

Sudden growth could mean what I just said, which was that blocksize growth could double in a month, and if we had implemented 2-4-8 already then we would be fully prepared to handle that situation. With your plan the user experience would turn into a nightmare of delayed and dropped transactions, as it has been recently during price rallies, and new users would be the ones affected by this in the worst way. That's no big deal, right?

What's worse is the dishonesty in presenting and supporting the 2-4-8 increase proposal and then doing a blatant bait &amp; switch scheme with SegWit. The issue of whether the network can handle 2MB right now has absolutely nothing to do with non-bandwidth related increases, and the attempt to confuse people into thinking that it does, which was brought to us by the lovely peice of poetry that was the Core Devs Scaling Plan, brings into question the integrity of Core as a whole. Of course, after being given a clear reason to assume bad faith on their part, we have seen a wave of shilling, started by them, against the concept of ever assuming bad faith in a developer.

Each share of GBTC represents 0.1BTC that is held in backing. Unlike an ETF, no bitcoin can be taken out.

Most transactions from normal users are as simple as possible. One or two inputs, one or two outputs, but most of the time it is just a one-to-one transfer of funds. How much will the fees be reduced in that simple and most common usage scenario? I've heard it is nowhere near a 30% savings, but if you can explain otherwise I'd like to hear. Regardless, if the transaction price doubles and you save 30%, are you really saving anything? Still, though, it would be nice to hear an answer to the previous, non-rhetorical question.

SegWit offers no great reduction in cost for normal transactions. It only benefits the user significantly when doing complicated transactions like multisig and the type which would be typical of the Lightning Network. The average bitcoiner hardly ever does transactions like that and will stop using the network entirely in a fee event.

Unfortunately for you, ViTRTor will likely not have any of his drugs for this match. I have no moral qualms about sports betting and bitcoin is definitely the best way to do it, but everybody has underestimated Weidman since his UFC debut. While he does win in very convincing fashion in all of his matches, it still doesn't seem like he has much of a skillset. My theory is that Chris doesn't actually have a fighting style or even study any of them. It seems like he only studies his opponent in order to counteract whatever fighting style to which they subscribe. 
He will definitely be beaten sometime in the next year or two, but I don't see any of the well-established fighters being capable of this feat since there is so much archived footage of them. Weidman will lose to a novice opponent who has very few fights on his record and ends matches so fast that profiling his style is impossible.

Russian currency basically sucks. Nobody around the world uses it except for the FOREX markets and a few countries near the border. Up until last year, the USD was used to conduct more international trade than any other currency. If bitcoin were to succeed in over-taking world finance and destroy both the dollar and the ruble, Russia wouldn't have lost very much in terms of power but the USA would be hurt badly. It won't make a difference to Putin. He'll just as happily trade in Yuan or Euro, but the USA will be financially demolished without the USD.

No it's not because SegWit will actually start out by offering something like 1.01MB and slowly increasing to ~1.6MB after adoption occurs a year or so later. Classic gives 2MB immediately after the fork. The difference is 99% of what bitcoiners have been asking for, which was and is a 1MB increase in the limit.

Core has no plans to ever go with 2-4-8 in the way it was originally proposed. The scaling proposal they put out clearly states that they will implement a "scaled down version of 2-4-8 which takes into account the scaling increases of SegWit, IBLT, weak blocks and other scaling solutions." Their real plan is a bait &amp; switch with something like 1.5-2-2.5 and we will end up with 2MB blocksize limit in the year 2020. This is not speculation. It's in their proposal.

There are many facts and opinions about how bitcoin works that the Core Devs never want you to talk about, and so they self-censor in an attempt to hinder the discussion of certain topics throughout the rest of the community, as you can [clearly see here.](
Put two and two together, and it doesn't take a genius programmer to figure out when somebody is trying to double-hoodwink you into mind control. Certain topics will not be mentioned and if you intrude into their conversations then you will be reprimanded, like what seemed to have happened just now. 
And, by the way you still haven't given any answer at all to the question of when you think internet and computer technology will be advanced enough for the bitcoin network to efficiently handle a 2MB blocksize limit. Feel free to leave an estimate of when that time will be right here.
@_date: 2016-01-12 23:46:49
The overall trend is exponential increase in BIP101 but between milestones (2MB to 4MB, 4MB to 8MB etc.) it is linear, ~~and since Classic stops increasing at 4MB it will be entirely linear.~~

There is nothing special about Monday except that it is the next day of GBTC trading on the OTC markets. That alone is enough to get me hyped up.

@_date: 2015-05-09 22:27:07
The bitcoin in GBTC come from BIT, which was the private investment vehicle started by Barry Silbert. For BIT shareholders, they are able to sell their shares to other accredited investors using BIT at any time, but they must wait 12 months after buying shares in order to sell them to the public through GBTC. If you have a certain amount of money to invest (I think the minimum is $200,000) then you can buy new bitcoins to put into BIT and then sell them 12 months later on GBTC.
There are actual bitcoins stored in BIT, well over 100,000BTC, but they cannot be removed for arbitrage purposes like they would with a fully vetted ETF approved by the SEC. This is also why the price of GBTC is so much higher than the exchanges right now, because you cannot just buy bitcoin, throw it into BIT, and then sell your newly formed GBTC shares and buy more bitcoin with the profit. You will be able to do that with COIN when it appears on the NASDAQ, and it seems like that will be the point where the price chart once again goes parabolic.

That's not going to ever happen when 75% of hashing power is pointing to one side of the fork AND the blocksize limit has been increased on that side AND the network has a backlog that needs to be cleared out which it currently does and will continue to have due to Core sitting on their asses.

There was a very interesting idea a couple of days ago on this issue.
1. Miners vote on block size and the bottom and top 20% are excluded (no change here)
2. If the middle 60% of voters all choose to raise the limit, then the bottom most vote of the middle 60% is the new limit. If the middle 60% of voters all choose to lower the limit, then the upper most vote of the middle 60% is the new limit.
This method seems to stop the 21% attack completely. I'd be happy to hear any criticism even though this isn't originally my concept.

Exactly this. Donations in bitcoin will roll in for a short while and then decline sharply. It is just about the worst possible way that a bank could experiment with the technology. If they would just allow people to buy and store bitcoin in their bank accounts or retirement funds then it could become a trend. People are very unlikely to buy bitcoin just to donate it afterwards.
Then again, this might be a way for the bank to simply test the payment technology to see if it works at all. They might not care how many donations are made nor the amount. As long as anything happens at all and it works as expected then they might decide to go with full integration with their other services. Hopefully this is their plan.

You can allow TOR connections to your XT node. There is a command that disables the DDOS prevention which blocks some TOR activity. More likely that W3C will block all of their payment traffic from ever touching TOR. 
Imagine bitcoin but with an "authorization server" that must sign each transaction. Nothing associated with TOR in any possible way would ever get signed. A bonus feature of this system is that if the "authorization server" operators decide that they don't like you for whatever reason, then they can just block you and say that you seemed to be using TOR. It would be a nightmare.

Satoshi said that the size of blocks would undoubtedly need to grow larger as time progresses in order to allow the bitcoin network to serve as many people as possible. Raising the block size limit is keeping bitcoin the same as the original vision of its creator. Nobody has any qualms about adding layers on top of the protocol, such as the Lightning Network, but a few shills are trying to change the original protocol by permanantly keeping the block size small. Some of them lie and say that they only want to delay the size cap increase by some random amount of time for some random reasons. Anybody who has ever assembled a computer themselves can easily spot them.
tl;dr Don't worry we will increase the block size and keep the bitcoin protocol in line with its original mission: to cheaply and securely be the main tool used in all worldwide financial transactions.
@_date: 2015-07-13 20:41:39
We're going to need to fix some technical issues before mass adoption can possibly occur. With the network in its current state, the ultimate goal of a worldwide, cheap, and equal-access financial backbone/currency is completely impossible. If we can develop a functional Lightning Network and increase the blocksize the proper amount without sacrificing a lot of decentralization, then we will be ready for billions of users.

The easiest way to safely hold (or as we say around here: HODL) coins for a long-term store of value and/or speculative investment is a Trezor hardware wallet or a competing equivalent. For the small amount of coin that you want to use for everyday purchases, you should go with a mobile wallet like Mycellium (Android) or Bread (iOS). 
Most of the big exchanges offer excellent platforms for trading if you want to earn profit that way. Some of them also have futures markets with up to 20x leverage for high risk/reward trades.
Mining is a whole nother ballgame and really shouldn't be a consideration unless you are extremely comfortable working with expensive computer parts and are good at troubleshooting. If you aren't working in the IT industry or at a computer shop, then you probably won't do very well with mining cryptocurrency. There are rare exceptions, such as the enthusiast who has built multiple custom PCs with high-end components and $1000 video cards with hand-assembled water cooling setups. 
You can also start a bitcoin business if that is more aligned with your particular skill set. The industry is still very, very young and can use a lot more development, especially in 3rd World countries.

It has a lot more appeal than saying, "Well, sometimes it is fast and sometimes not because we didn't want to raise the block size limit and we conflated the definition of a transaction with confirmation. It also costs more sometimes, too, depending on network usage, but you can always raise the miner's fee by 0.001BTC to get to the front of the queue."

It would be even simpler to set a scheduled blocksize increase to occur automatically about once every two years. Then you would only have to hard fork it one time and it keeps increasing for a very, very long time as storage and bandwidth become cheaper. If the curve of technological progress changes greatly, which is very unlikely, then we will hard fork again. This paper on BIP100 shows it as an almost absolute certainty that we will need to hard fork at least twice. I would rather have 1 guaranteed hard fork with a low chance of needing future hard forks than to have a very high, near certain chance of future necessary hard forks. 
Also, don't try to sweep the problem under the rug by saying that we will likely have other issues that need a hard fork and raising the limit at that time would be an easy code change to slip in. Anybody who has worked in IT for 5 minutes knows that the optimal change to any sort of network is to do one thing at a time, every time, if possible. Want to upgrade all the rack servers in your data center? Yeah, you should probably pick a time to do that, and only that, and hold off on that power grid redundancy project for a little while longer. One thing at a time. Let's not leave a minefield of necessary hard forks that we'll have to wander through while managing whatever other problems occur in the bitcoin network.
Same thing as upgrading the drivers for your hardware. Sure, you could go through the entire data center and upgrade every driver/bios for every device at the exact same time. I mean, you could do that if you were an idiot that wanted to lose his job. I would suggest updating the firmware on all of the drives at the same time while doing absolutely nothing else. If that all works out fine, then you can move onto ethernet card drivers, and so and so forth.
I hope what I'm saying all comes together. The best option will likely be the one that requires the least amount of hard forking in the future combined with some other simplistic aspects, such as choosing a fixed rate of increase of a much more complicated dynamic increase over time.

A lot of this attitude might have to do with their ego. Hackers often fancy themselves as demigods of the internet. Whereas most of the world has still not even heard the word 'bitcoin' once in their entire life (yet), nearly every dedicated hacker on the planet has known about it since at least 2011. Their problem is that only a very small percentage chose to start using/hodling bitcoins before the last big peak, and the others are understandably upset for two reasons: 1) they didn't have the ability to foresee the amazing amount of success the bitcoin network has had and very likely rallied against it the entire time as "kid's stuff" and 2) they lost out on a ton of profit due to this hubris. 
In terms of bitcoin trading and investing, this is what is often referred to as "sour grapes" where a bitter group of people thought that grapes wouldn't grow in a certain patch of soil and so no time should be invested in planting seeds there. Somebody else came along with a different prediction and planted the grape seeds instead. Now the plants have grown and produced many grapes, but the group that said this was impossible have since declared that the harvested grapes must have turned out sour because their ego will not allow for them to admit to being wrong about the soil/investment opportunity.
It is really sad to think of all the people in the hacking community who should have figured out the potential of bitcoin long, long ago, and now they can see that the profit they missed out on would get them out of their parent's basement and pay for a small data center with fiber. Talk about kicking yourself while you're already down...

ASIC mining brought a massive amount of centralization at first, but over time it is being taken over by increasing decentralization due to the inability to profit from a massive pool. As pool size increases the management cost increases exponentially. Then again, a lot of this is just my speculation because nobody knows exactly who is mining on what pool. For all we know there could be one person running every bitcoin mine in China at the moment.

The only place that happened was with the scammers running the trollbox over at BTC-e. They've been lying through their teeth for the last couple of months about LTC and were supporting 90% of the trade volume during that time. Though there are still trading opportunities for it, nothing is being developed specifically for litecoin anymore. No new miners will be coming out. No new wallets are being made for it. No new businesses are accepting it as payment. Coinbase is never going to touch it after seeing what basically amounts to the network dying. Hashrate will continue to fall.

1. Increase the blocksize to 8MB with automatic bi-yearly increases.
Without this we are going to have a very expensive payment network that goes against everything bitcoin was ever meant to be. LN plus off-chain systems will help to scale up, but we absolutely must have block size increases and start doing them right now. The userbase could easily explode overnight to 10x what it is at the moment.

1. Block size increases
2. Fees stay about the same as they are right now
3. More transactions are processed in the bigger blocks
4. Therefore more money from fees is raised
In 20 years time, the blocks will be 8GB each, so about 8000x as much money earned per block in transaction fees at the maximum. This is the only way to make sure that the blockchain is still directly accessible by every person on the planet. If we don't do this then we will just have the same centralized scheme of money that is currently in place, with only the elites having direct access to all of the features of the financial system.

1. You can install bitcoin wallet software onto any device that runs a compatible OS. However, you can also store coins on any storage medium without any OS installed. The coins in your wallet are stored in one of two ways: a wallet.dat file or a private key, both of which can be used to store or backup bitcoins.
2. I like Electrum (Win7), Bread Wallet (iOS), and Mycellium (Android). They are very user friendly and quick to set up.
3. The best form of backup is 'cold storage' where either your wallet.dat or your private key is held on a device that is not connected to the internet. Ideally, this device is never connected to the internet at any point in time. This should be used for large amounts of coin, which is relative to the individual. You can even store a backup of your coins on a piece of paper which is called a "paper wallet" and can be hand-written (with crayons if you want, feel free to color it, too).
4. This is *THE PLACE* to come and ask "stupid questions" about bitcoin. Nobody in the world perfectly understands what bitcoin is and every single one of us is currently in the learning process. Some may pretend as if this doesn't apply to them, but they should not be taken seriously.

Allow me try to illustrate the situation a little more for you.

Transactions are instant. Go to a local bitcoin business and buy a cup of coffee or something similar.

There is no practical reason that bitcoin ever would be issued on paper.

If the average person could teleport gold bars around the world instantly, have them take up zero space, and audit their entire stockpile for 100% purity in a few seconds for free, then paper gold would never have been invented.

The units are not necessarily interchangeable. They are completely separate. You could have a sidechain that starts with 21million units and doubles every day. You could dump 100billion of them on the open market one day a year from now and crash the price to almost zero. Bitcoin would still have 21million maximum units and the price would still be the market value of bitcoin. Sidechains *could* act as a mirror for bitcoin and be used for microtransactions and IoT transactions, but the sidechain can be any kind of blockchain it wants to be, including a completely separate entity which is linked only by a single two-way peg (read: hash) on both chains.

The type of attack that would affect a POS transaction would be exceedingly rare. I've not heard of it happening before. Every time I make a purchase either online or in real life the merchant always accepts the payment when it shows up in their wallet with zero confirmations.

"Low fees" is completely honest. Arguing that transactions aren't instant is a matter of semantics. I'm open to calling them "fast transactions" instead, but when something happens with a second or two delay, like my transaction being processed by Bitpay, then I don't think calling it instant is misleading. Nothing ever happens instantly without tearing a hole in space-time. When you instantly hit the steering wheel column in a car crash it happens in a fraction of a second but we always refer to such events as instant. To argue we should remove "low fees" is just ridiculous.

The uncomfortable truth is that both cases are completely realistic and the worst case doesn't even require some freak bug to happen.

What is most disturbing is how many bitcoiners still believe in fantasies such as "forced hard-forking can ultimately do nothing to stop us" and "a lack of ability to regulate will always ensure our ultimate victory." Make no mistake about it; This is a war and we absolutely can lose it in every possible way if we commit too many errors or we are too arrogant about our new technology.

Forgive me, but I am having a little bit of a hard time understanding what you are asking in the last part. Do you want a USB flashdrive that will instantly run your wallet on any computer you plug it into? In that case I think you need to install an OS on it. Alternatively, you could install wallet software on all of your computers and only keep the wallet.dat on the USB flash. Either way, make sure to back it up in cold storage if you have more than a bitcoin or two.

If that was the case then it couldn't have possibly backfired in a worse way. The consensus amongst nearly every thought leader in the USA is that Snowden is a hero for all time. Average citizens like the guy and everybody now knows about and hates the NSA. Military have a gag order across all branches and ranks to not utter a single word about him, but I'd bet a whole lot of money that the majority of the boots on the ground absolutely love him just like they love Ron Paul (the most voted-for presidential candidate in all branches of the military). Then the movie that comes out showing Snowden as a sort of new age folk hero gets the Academy Award for Best Documentary, a genre of film which is always meant to strive for truth and be used for justice instead of propaganda.

You should consult with Ryan X. who was the cryptocurrency software expert at reddit for a few months before "leaving" the website (this is how things work in Silicon Valley-style tech companies). He was doing some innovative work on a new type of message board that would be decentralized and use the blockchain to take care of some of the operations. [Here is an article that goes over his project briefly]( and there are several other articles on it. I understand that you are not looking to decentralize the server-side of reddit like he is planning, but perhaps some of your concepts would prove to be compatible with his greater vision.

EU Advocate General goes against the Tax Agency - and believes that the shifting of bitcoin should not be subject to VAT. "It is a setback," said the Swedish Tax expert Martin Loeb.
One of the ECJ Advocates General has today submitted a domförslag current bitcoinväxling and VAT. This announcement is a heavy blow to the Swedish Tax Agency, which wanted to see a VAT.
- She suggests that the exchange transaction will be tax exempt. It is not what we thought. There is no judgment without Advocate General think, but it will be like this so it's good that we have clarity in what terms, says Martin Loeb, a legal expert at the Swedish Tax Agency.
Now waiting for the parties to the European Court of Justice should have their say. It is not bound to comply with the General domförslag but it tends to weigh heavily when the judges make their decision. Thereafter, the final decision formally to the Supreme Administrative Court in Sweden.
- There is a lot of uncertainty remains and that is why we kept the pressure on this would be submitted to the European Court of Justice, says Martin Loeb.
The background to this process is a matter of bitcoin and VAT as a software developer David Hedqvist asked three years ago. He went in the tanks to expand with a switching service for bitcoin. And to find out if he would have to account for VAT on exchange turned David Hedqvist Tax Agency.
- But I got the vague answer, so I wrote to the Tax Board to get an advance. It took some years ago came a message that was positive, he says."

I've said that I wouldn't respond again in this thread, but, since I basically called you a liar/manipulator, it would be dishonorable to not offer an explanation.
When you say, "X changed during Y event,"  then you are implying a causal association between the two when nothing more than a correlation has been shown. If you can prove that the Obama administration has been protective of gun owner's rights then your previous implication of that would be factually correct, but you cannot prove that because Obama has said he supports all federal politicians who've wished to ban several guns and/or gun parts through legislation. I really don't want to get into this any further here. Sources have already been posted and there are dozens of videos where the president says what he supports on these issues, including the banning of different guns and gun parts. 
This has gone on for far too long already. Send me a private message if you wish to respond to me again. This sub is not the place to extensively debate these types of issues. I hope this helped.

Bitcoin days destroyed refers to the amount of time 1BTC worth of bitcoin has been sitting at the same address until it moves. This occurs for every bitcoin transaction on the blockchain. For example, it Satoshi has 1,000,000 coins and they haven't moved for 2,000 days, and Satoshi then sends those coins to a new address to make a transaction, then you would have 2,000,000,000 bitcoin days being destroyed. If you had 0.1 BTC sitting on your computer hard drive and they had been there for 100 days, if you spent them that would be 10 bitcoin days destroyed.
This is an extremely useful metric for measuring activity across the network because it gives us a look into the ratio of holding/spending bitcoin. If a lot of bitcoin days are being destroyed then a lot of really old coins that haven't moved in a long time are being spent.

The term "instant payments" is used widely around the financial world to mean "within a couple of seconds." In reality, nothing ever happens instantly and there is always a time delay in a chain of events of any kind, even if it is measured in picoseconds. When I check out with Bitpay the payment receipt page loads in my browser after less than 2 seconds. I would call this instant, as in "the moment he heard the explosion he instantly dropped to the ground." I see no problem with this language but am open to other opinions. As for free, I've never called bitcoin payments free because, thus far, they haven't been. Nobody should fall into that trap.

Visa and Mastercard call payments that take a second or two to transact "instant" and this is copied throughout the entire banking system. My money is "instantly" transferred to another account when I do it with online banking. Have you ever tapped somebody on the shoulder and had them instantly turn around? Yeah, that wasn't instant either. 
As for the "free" part, I never said that. "Cheap and instant" is not a lie or misleading. "Cheap and fast" also works. When you run a multiplayer game on your PS4 it instantly starts looking for matches on the network. That is also not instant. Don't get me wrong. I am completely in favor of removing the word "free" and "zero fees" because those are blatant lies, but the use of the word instant in this context is absolutely accurate.

Oh, I see that was a misunderstanding on my part. Still, not to be a smart aleck or anything, the sidechain also serves the purpose of extra security for your currency or tokens. All of the data within it will be permanently hashed about every 10 minutes on the world's largest super computer network. So that is another thing that sidechains allow you to do.
Just FYI, I am 100% in favor of increasing the blocksize by a significant amount, immediately, and sidechains will be very useful to bitcoin only if we have enough room on the main chain to support all of them. There is no telling how large the demand for this application could be, but it is entirely feasible that every single company and product line on Earth will one day require their own sidechain.

Fees are going to increase exponentially over time unless we increase the block size significantly. If you keep the blocks small then it just makes it easier for miners to cheat. Either way, the fees will balance out to give the same amount of financial incentive for both sizes, but the larger blocks would require more work on the part of the miners and act as a strong disincentive. The correct choice here is painfully obvious.

What Satoshi did not envision was the Lightning Network. Once that is in place it will be imperative for every payment channel operator to have a full node running. Only a fool would allow their coins to be used to run such a system without having their own copy of a verified blockchain available at all times. Some of these operators will be large companies like banks and exchanges, but many, and perhaps the majority of them, will be very small. If you have 21 bitcoins that you can invest into being a payment channel operator and earn a few coins each year then the node you run will be paid for many times over even if the blocks are all 8MB.

You asked this question: "what's going [on] in the last photo?" and I replied to you with a complete and accurate answer. Next time you wish to make a point about a picture being morally objectionable to include in a photo set, then you should ask "Why include the last picture of the ATM lineup when it seems to just be making fun of the people who are poor or unfortunate to not have any bitcoins?" This was a miscommunication on your part and I'm glad to talk about it now that you've clarified what you meant.
Yes, the last picture could be offensive to people based on the unfortunate situation currently happening in Greece, and it could also be seen as exploitative of their struggle as a way to pump up the price of bitcoin for our own profit. I'm not too worried about people being offended by bitcoin messages like this so long as they learn about it and eventually realize why it is such a great financial tool, possibly the best ever created. 
There were several things said and shown to me that offended my way of thinking and my understanding of how the world worked when I first heard about bitcoin. Then I realized that my previous way of thinking was horribly wrong and this is the ultimate form of money. All of the things that offended me in the conversation only helped to reinforce how wrong my previous opinion on money had been. We should endeavor to be kind and courteous as much as possible, but you should not be afraid of offending people a little bit in order to help them realize the truth; The E.U. is financially raping them, their children, and their grandchildren and bitcoin is a viable way for some Greeks to protect themselves. 
If you have the time to read [this article]( then please do so. It illustrates exactly what I am talking about when it comes to people sometimes learning while they are being offended. Wences Casares insulted Bill Gates to his face by saying, “You are spending billions to make poor people poorer,” in front a crowded room, and this changed Bill's mind completely about cryptocurrency and bitcoin. Now he is completely head over heels for the idea of cryptocurrency but still not sure if bitcoin will win or lose the race.
You seem like the kind of person that thinks negativity is never beneficial for learning or that positivity is always a better way to learn everything in this world, and if that is the case then we'll just have to disagree and be done with this conversation. I'm not saying that it was right to put that photo at the end of that particular set, perhaps it was wrong to do so, but I'd at least hope that you'll entertain the possibility that when people are offended it can be used as an effective part of the learning process.

One possible explanation for the similarity in writing, both on forum posts and the white paper, could be that Satoshi was at least two people. One person wrote all of the code and the other figured out a good way to communicate the significance of this code to the cryptography community. As long as the same person was always writing the code and the other person was always handling the communications side it would appear plausible to always be the same person. In another possibility, the "person" writing the code could have easily been a collective of programmers that learned or worked on programming projects together over several years and had very similar styles. 
I've always thought that Satoshi was a band of NSA hackers who turned rogue once they figured out that their organization was holding back what could possibly be the greatest invention in history just because it had the potential to limit the power of the government. Unfortunately, this is business as usual for the powers that be. They invent things for the specific purpose of making sure that other people do not invent them. If this wasn't the case then we would all be burning hemp fuel in our heaters and running vaporized-gas engines in our cars that get over 100MPG. After "they" have invented something that "they" don't want the general public to ever know about "they" monitor all communications and patent applications worldwide to make sure "it" is never allowed to be "invented."
Tinfoil hat stuff, for sure, but so was the entire concept of the NSA and J-SOC just a few years ago. Also, the CIA was forced to reveal, in a court of law, that they did invent a literal "heart attack gun" that was both silent and untraceable. Truth is stranger and scarier than fiction.

Let's say that the maximum size of blocks that most of the nodes will be able to store and transmit efficiently is 8MB. If you lower the cap when the network is being used less then you do not decrease hardware requirements at all. For instance, if the last 100 blocks happened to be 1MB, then what would be the benefit of lowering the cap from 8MB down to 1MB during this time? Each node would still need to download/upload and store a 1MB block no matter if the limit was lowered or not. It would make no difference at all in that case. 
Alternatively, why would you ever raise the limit above 8MB based on demand of the network when it would simply mean that many nodes would not be able download and verify the new blocks fast enough to keep up? This could easily be exploited to lower the number of nodes that have verified the newest block and would compromise security of the network to a significant degree. 
It doesn't matter what you would base the dynamic changing limit upon. The only variable that matters is what can be quickly propagated throughout the network and cheaply stored at each node using current technology. There is zero benefit to setting the block size limit below that point and there is an enormous security risk for setting the limit above it. 
So, then, what size block can an average person be expected to run on a fairly inexpensive node? We are about to find out very soon, but 8MB seems like a very modest and wise place to start according to the reams of mathematical and technological analysis that bitcoin developers and researchers have produced on the topic. If the 8MB limit is proven to work well for most of the current nodes, then the only question left is whether or not bandwidth and storage capacity will continue to advance as fast as it has been thus far.

Node bandwidth is a bimodal distribution. To give a mean or median for ["reasonably connect number of peers"]( doesn't work at all in these scenarios. High-upload and low-upload node groups both need to be accounted for separately, similar to any other P2P network. Same distribution applies to bit-torrent: many high-capacity seeders and many low-capacity, very few are in the middle.

Not the same thing at all. Every single share in those funds is accounted for with actual bitcoin and new shares cannot just be printed as with paper money or gold. The "paper" part of "paper gold" does not, in any meaningful way, refer to the fact that a piece of paper is used to designate ownership. It refers to the fact that it can be printed without any actual gold backing, just like dollars. There is nothing wrong with keeping track of things using paper, like a bitcoin paper wallet. There is everything wrong with printing out pieces of paper that are backed by nothing, which is the exact opposite of how the GBTC and ETN work.

At the present time we are not seeing any significant push from large companies to host nodes in their data centers using fiber-optic internet. When this idea starts to become very popular amongst hundreds or thousands of the largest companies around the world, likely occuring after their business is somewhat dependent on using the bitcoin network, then we may see the switchover that Satoshi talked about and we can raise the blocksize to an extremely high level very quickly. For now, we will just have to set the maximum block size to as high a level as can be expected to perform well with the low cost nodes that we have available. Hopefully the Lightning Network is an effective measure to allow scaling that can handle the adoption curve up until the point of data center-based nodes.

You are assuming that the clusterfuck which that scenario will lead to can and will always be worked out over time. The effect on the price could, and most likely would, be devastating, and if it drops below a certain point then I, along with every other bitcoin user, will permanently jump ship. You can talk tough all you want, but when the chips are down and you find that 99% of your bitcoins worth has vanished due to a never ending series of fork-induced clusterfucks, and a multi-billion dollar media campaign to twist the knife in further, then you'll jump ship just like everybody else. What keeps the network alive is people believing in it, and the fact that it can keep forking infinitely certainly does nothing to ensure people will forever have faith in it. Forking could make people believe in it even more and it could have the exact opposite effect.
You are assuming people will make logical choices. That way of thinking hurts bitcoin because it is false. The horrorshow that the media could put on during every forced fork could erase all possibility of mass adoption ever occurring. I heard there was the plant that grows in crappy soil, requires very little water or maintenance, and can be used for hemp fiber that is 10X stronger than cotton. This plant is also a great source of fuel for everything from oil lamps to diesel engines, and it costs far less to make than gasoline and has, by comparison, almost zero impact on the environment. People, of course, according to your way of thinking, would definitely choose to grow these plants rather drill for oil and grow thirsty cotton plants, right? RIGHT? 
You are going to have to face up to a very hard and disturbing fact right now; No amount of technology can save you from all of the forces in the universe and bitcoin can absolutely be killed despite any amount of consensus-making technology that the network is capable of producing.

This happened repeatedly in a thread yesterday about removing the language "cheap &amp; fast" from bitcoin.org.

Bank of America said that bitcoin, specifically, has the potential to make e-commerce more efficient. It wouldn't surprise me if tommorow they announced a pilot program for such a venture.
You are also completely missing the opportunity that bitcoin might not be a payment system at all and will just continue to be a barter commodity, such as gold. Again, even this outlook is too limited. We may have a new category of commodity/money that will take shape using bitcoin's blockchain as the backbone. At this juncture, it's really hard to imagine all of the places this could go and all the things it could become.

The bitcoin price bottom has always formed in the domain of the previous peak before the current ATH. This new $200 bottom level, if that is what we are currently experiencing, is in range of the peak before the $1.1k ATH, and, if the fractal pattern continues, then the next bottom will be in the domain of $1k. The new ATH will be several times that amount, possibly as high as $10k.

Unveiling a data science layer for the blockchain that lets participants in markets like Bitcoin analyze data and uncover hidden relationships, Coinalytics today invited data-intensive enterprises to derive newfound real-time business intelligence and risk assessment from blockchains and decentralized applications.
The new intelligence layer applies advanced machine learning and distributed systems to cryptographic platforms, enabling enterprises in a variety of industries like online payments, financial services and decentralized applications to make smart decisions in real-time, while maintaining data privacy and trust.
The company also announced today that it has received initial seed funding from The Hive, an incubator for start-ups developing technology for data-intensive enterprises.
“The maturation of a market is often defined by its ability to provide analysis and insight on transactions and developments,” said Fabio Federici, CEO of Coinalytics. “Our platform offers enterprises a real-time ability to convert information into action that will break down a significant barrier for mainstream adoption of the blockchain.”
The “blockchain” is a term used to define a global system of record that offers provable trust through a decentralized peer-to-peer network, and is secured by its large and distributed array of aggregated computational power. A blockchain is most notably used to capture and record Bitcoin transactions, but has recently become an option for other transaction-driven users, like investment banks.
However, traditional data analytics approaches are incompatible with the blockchain due to the blockchain’s lack of a central data source, its pseudonymous data model and the way the network reaches consensus.
Coinalytics’ platform uses advanced pattern recognition and real-time online learning to mine data and provide business and risk intelligence on transactions in real-time, even before a transaction is confirmed by the network.
The platform’s data infrastructure is architected to scale to the scope of any decentralized network, while also augmenting the blockchain’s privacy and trust.
“The concept of a blockchain is expanding rapidly into classic early technology adoption industries like financial services, supply chain management and the Internet of Things,” said Mr. Federici. “We believe that growth will be fueled by an ability to assess risk and make better business decisions, and we anticipate Coinalytics will be an instigator of that ability.”
The seed funding from The Hive will be used to expand the company’s technology and sales teams and fuel general company growth.
About Coinalytics
Coinalytics is a Palo Alto-based startup that is turning blockchain data into actionable insights and real-time intelligence. Founded by a team of entrepreneurs with security and data infrastructure backgrounds at Google and Amazon Web Services, Coinalytics was accelerated by 500 Startups before raising a seed round led by The Hive.

It's extremely simple.
Customer A has a $10k emergency fund in their bank account at all times. They also have a house loan from the bank worth $200k. They pay an enormous amount of money for these services, even though they have perfect credit. Customer B has $1k in their account half of the time and the other half it is far less. They have a car loan from the bank worth $10k, and even though their credit is terrible and their rates are sky high, they end up paying a small fraction to the bank of what Customer A pays.
Now, bear in mind that the bank is doing the exact same amount of work for both customers. We have two accounts that take the exact same time to maintain and two loans that take the exact same amount of work to process.
Here's the kicker; The bank, in addition to owning a full service, normal rates "big bank" operation also has a large stake in smaller outlets that universally engage in predatory practices of which the larger entity would never dare be directly involved, including higher rates and fees than normal for far less financial services. Customer B is likely to not be intelligent enough to understand when they are getting scammed and overcharged financially, or they are intelligent enough but are too depressed, on drugs, or lack the self-esteem to demand fair treatment. 
There are a million ways that a bank can cancel an account, such as changing the date on your payment plan by one day without properly informing you about it, raising the rates on your loan, lowering the interest rate on your savings account so you miss an automatic payment by just a few dollars, or accuse you of 'suspicious activity' for absolutely no reason at all. Plus, they can do all of this with no legal repercussions unless you have a boatload of money to sue them. 
Knowing that the bank can push an entire segment of their customer base onto a far higher yield investment through manipulation, and that Customer B is likely to never have enough money to draw up a lawsuit with a bank, and that the bank has zero interest in any form of morality that has ever existed (aside from the Gordon Gecko philosophy), what do you think the bank is going to do?

You're suggesting miners implement a protocol by which they weigh the fee vs. the transaction block size limit requests. This can be worked around with slightly higher fees and will still allow the attack to be executed for thousands of dollars per day.

No, I think you understood things well. The reason it has been proposed that miners alone vote on block size is because the financial cost to secure votes is substantial, which would make the attack on the blocksize voting process cost tens of millions of dollars up front. 
When user wallets are capable of voting on their preferred block size then the cost of such an attack (filling the network with high fee transactions that carry low blocksize votes) comes down to thousands of dollars per day with zero money up front. So in this case the cost of the 'small block attack' is insubstantial.

My comment was not about bitcoin, but rather it was showing the logic of why a bank would engage in shady business practices in order to push their low-reward/retail customers onto smaller, more predatory cash-checking and payday-loan types of businesses that the bank has invested into. Customers who are obviously less financially savvy, such as the ones with poorer credit and smaller balances, will most definitely be at higher risk for the bank forcing them to use one of the more expensive alternatives like a Moneytree or Amscott.
I was actually responding to regarding the comment: "What are you talking about... Why on earth would banks want to drop retail customers?"

The Jan 2015 crash looks like a mirror image of the July 2013 crash, which, considering this current bottom level took four times as long to occur as the last time, means we have reached the new bottom and have about 12-16 months before the new ATH.
@_date: 2015-09-13 12:17:36
I was talking about point  specifically, but I'm not entirely sure what effect the consideration of bitcoin days destroyed might have on either bullet point. There would have to be some sort of predictive formula for how and when the days destroyed rise and fall. For instance, during all of the bubbles thus far days destroyed spiked to a very high amount, but it has also spiked during times of overall low activity on the the blockchain. Both situations might lead to a skewing of the votes, since users who're moving very old coins might be unlikely to cast any block size preference with their transactions. Instinct tells me this is not a predictable factor upon which to base a standard, but I am totally unsure about it at this time. 
Either way, thanks for the interesting idea.

If it was just one person or a small group that kept frequenting the store just to talk about bitcoin over and over again, then I'd request that they leave before the police arrived. If I had a lot of different customers requesting the exact same thing over an extended period of time, then whatever that thing may be (as long as it was legal) you could bet your life savings that I'd bend over backwards in every way possible to get it done. The fact that setting up a Coinbase or Bitpay account takes just a few minutes, at most, and costs nothing, leads me to believe that this business owner doesn't want to be in their current line of work.
Hell, if enough people requested that I stood outside in a chicken costume on Saturdays then it would be as good as done.

You are getting downvoted because it is generally very bad advice to tell somebody to go for the cheaper deal when buying bitcoin directly from a bitcoiner.

You've got to put this into perspective.

The only aspect that bitcoin needs to preserve to be "digital gold" is the 21 million coin limit. Let's take physical gold as an example. If I could actually trade little bits of gold a few million times per second, how would that remove any of the properties that make it a precious metal which is a store of value? Is the slowness of transfers or lack of transactional bandwidth (i.e. block size) one of the properties that makes gold what is today? I would say absolutely not.

That's the point that we are trying to make. There is nothing to forgive somebody for if they had a lot of faith in Karpeles back in 2012. He ran the very first bitcoin exchange in the world. Others tried to make cheap imitations of his invention, but most of them failed miserably or turned out to be scams. If you trusted Karpeles in 2014, then there must be something wrong with you, or maybe you are just defending him as a friend or associate. If you trusted him in 2012, then there is certainly nothing wrong with your reasoning at all.

Such a system would allow for individual users to be shut down by anybody with enough bandwidth and hacking. One day you might try to purchase something and find out that big brother has commandeered all of your "trusted partners" and now you are SOL. Access to your coins is suddenly not possible.
That's impossible with bitcoin. Sure, somebody can try to take down the entire bitcoin network if they want to waste a ton of money, and perhaps somebody will find a way to make this happen some day, but so long as the network is functioning at all, meaning that independent miners are truly competing for block rewards, no individual users can ever be excluded.

That has absolutely nothing to do with what I said. The point is that it would be very inexpensive for anybody, even a single person with any sort of intentions, to game a system where the user wallets are basically voting on their preferred maximum blocksize. 
You raise your fee a slight amount, set your maximum block size inclusion for the transaction to be very low, and then the busiest shopping day of the year (whatever it normally is) can be effectively ruined for everybody using bitcoin. With miners voting, this 'small block attack' would cost a fortune. With wallets doing it, you are looking at pennies on the dollar by comparison.

Just because you are part of a group on the official paperwork doesn't mean that you constitute the "material" of that group. It is not a literal statement. See below:
"Well, Johnny has been a real surprise star on our baseball team this year, Mrs. Jones. You know, he's not what you would call baseball star material, but it doesn't really matter that he weighs 400lbs. because he hits every single ball out of the park."
Being "_insert_group_here_  material" is a figure of speech. It doesn't mean that you are literally a material part of that group. An example which I'm absolutely sure will make you realize this is George W. Bush. He was President of the USA, but was he really presidential material?

There is no reason that it cannot be used for both purposes. This project was designed to be very long running and it is certain that so long as technology continues to improve, at whatever pace, the blockchain itself will eventually be able to handle every single transaction of every single asset in the world, including all of the IoT transactions. We have every reason not to try and push bitcoin into some rigid definition of what it can become, because the limit is likely infinity. I expect millions of transactions per second, directly on the blockchain, by the year 2044, and by that point it won't matter what you call it.

You ain't seen nothing yet. If this takes a major foothold and is adopted by the masses then its price will spike to an unbelievable level from which it won't fall until bitcoin use declines. If that happens then there will likely be entire weeks where the price goes up $1000/day or more.

Gold is not a popular way of saving for the average person, even today. Since paper money and plastic cards are so much easier to carry around and they are accepted at 99% of merchants, the general population has no interest in precious metals as a form of money, savings, or anything other than jewlery. Then again, it is the general population that succumbs to financial disasters such as hyper-inflation while the upper class has their savings secured by keeping 5-10% of their assets firmly planted in metals and other commodities. Hedging for total economic collapse is a concept that the upper class does not want the lower classes to ever attempt because it is a threat to their own hedging efforts.
Bitcoin is never going to gain mass adoption on the basis of it being a good hedging instrument during the next worldwide depression. Keep in mind that it doesn't need to gain mass adoption to be a success. Even if bitcoin is used as a niche hedging commodity this would cause a huge increase in market cap. That would decrease volatility making it much easier for people in 3rd world countries to trust it as a currency, at least for the purposes of remittances and things like international charity organizations. Even if that was all that it accomplished, then I'd consider bitcoin a clear success.
It's just really hard to say where bitcoin is going relative to gold in the next five years. They are radically different and exactly the same in a very peculiar combination of ways that the world has never before seen, and that is part of what makes it so exciting.

Most of these retailers use a payment processor that automatically updates the price of items according to the BTC exchange rate.

Not only is it the best payment mechanism and store of value ever conceived, but it has attributes that make gold look risky (there are zero bitcoin-filled asteroids in the universe, I checked).

I would add that if we do see the price go 10x then you should probably cash-in a small portion of around 10% of your stash. Doing this will take a load of stress off your shoulders as you can rest assured knowing that you at least didn't lose anything on this crazy ride.
From that point onwards everything you have in BTC will be pure profit and the stress of the rollercoaster will be much easier to handle. If you don't cash-in that small portion of your BTC then you will be much more susceptible to stress and panic trading.

It is not possible due to ASIC miners being so much faster at hashing than any home computer. You might get a few MH/s at the most. Right now the average bitcoin miner is producing a few TH/s.

Bitcoin gives you absolute assurance that no capital controls or bank bail-ins will ever happen with your money. If you think what happened in Greece could never happen in your country then you are a fool. Your country has already done the exact same thing as Greece (locking all accounts and payment channels down), and worse, but they might not happen to be doing it as this exact moment in time. They will do it again, and you can either be ready or get screwed.
There is no good reason not to put at least 1% of your net worth into bitcoin in order to avoid any and all trouble that might arise from banks or the government locking down your money and credit supply. Think about it this way; if one can only spend $50 from their bank account each day and their car breaks down, then how are they going to get to work? Sure, you can keep $3,000 cash buried in your backyard just in case, but bitcoin is much easier to hide, more durable, and more secure.
For this reason alone everybody should own some bitcoin.

If you have a bitcoin ATM nearby or a bitcoin debit card then you can pay for the car repair even if the mechanic doesn't take BTC. There are many places that erase the daily fluctuations in value like Uphold. They also offer a debit card. 
As far as people living only with BTC purchases there are a few. The first attempt at doing this was in a documentary called Life on Bitcoin which I recommend for entertainment only. It was filmed in 2013 when more than 95% of the current bitcoin services were unavailable, and they were globetrotting at the time. Some other guy is traveling around Asia using BTC. His trip might be over by now. Not sure if he is making a video or blogging about it.
You are mostly correct in that BTC is not a viable way to make everyday purchases yet for much of the world. If you lived in South America or Europe then 100% of your money could be in bitcoin and used for daily purchases. In other places it makes a solid hedge against inflation and adds greater access to your money in the inevitable case of a banking crisis.

Getting away with almost any crime can be done with near 100% certainty. However, for some, the act is only satisfying when they purposely leave behind a trail of clues.
"Ha ha! Even though I made many, many mistakes on purpose, those fools STILL cannot catch me! I'm the best ever!"
That's how the criminal mind works. It's not that they want to be caught, it's that they want to get away with it and then be able to laugh at the people investigating so as to feed the ego.

Bitcoin is a medium of trade that requires no middleman. Coinmap.org shows a lot of brick &amp; mortar places that accept it. There are over 100K online retailers and 500 ATM locations where you can transact with bitcoin. Latin America and Europe now have bitcoin debit cards that work everywhere you can use a credit card.

As I understand it, no.

I actually do think it is better that way for the time being. Bitcoin needs a lot more development before it can handle mass adoption. We simply don't have enough infrastructure built yet to deliver on the promise of money network that the entire world can use. 
If people ask me about bitcoin then I enthusiastically give my honest opinion and try to keep it toned down as much as possible. The only thing I am slightly dishonest about is how much they should buy. I really think that anybody who hears about bitcoin and is intrigued should run to the bank and dump as much money in as they possibly can, right now, but unfortunately there is no way I can tell people that because then it just sounds like a scam.

That's wrong. Miners can and will choose what their minimum fee is for inclusion in a block. Right now zero-fee transactions are possible sometimes because the block reward is so high. Once the block reward is zero there won't be a miner or pool in the world that would ever accept a zero-fee transaction, and thus they will get paid even if the block size goes to infinity.

I would always advise against going into business with friends that you are very close with and have a shared history. Most new businesses fail regardless of who your partner may be, and it usually sours the relationship of the owners and investors.

On the one hand it would legitimize bitcoin, and on the other it will be competition. I'm not worried about competition because the second that their network even slightly trips up (from something like a North Korea hacking attempt) all of the users will come rushing into other currencies, and at that point it will be much easier for them to get bitcoin because they will just be trading one cryptocurrency for another one instead of going from cash to crypto.

One way to look at this is the business incentive. BTC-e can make some commission from these coins being exchanged through them now, but what would that do to hurt the bitcoin network and also their future profits?

You sound like right now your understanding of what you are attempting to do is very, very shaky. At least save two copies of your wallet.dat file off of the computer where you are installing Bitcoin Core. Don't take this the wrong way, but it sounds like you might accidentally delete that file yourself somehow.

You trade on BitFinex, correct? Yeah, don't do that anymore. If you don't lose your shorts because of a narrow-focused prediction then you will lose them due to a trading engine error.
Check out all of the other exchanges. The volume is 2-4x higher than during the last $300 rallies. Only BitFinex is seeing low volume and that is because their service has been shown to be faulty and was abandoned by most traders.

Google Ventures invested in Ripple a long time ago. It was one of the first and only alt coins to gain momentum. The biggest issue it faces is the 97% pre-mine which is still entirely under the control of the developers and investors.

Perhaps we will be running on a voting system and the miners will just so happen to continue choosing 1MB for the time being, but that doesn't count as a hard limit. 
I hope I've made this perfectly clear, and if you'd like to make a bet or wager then I encourage you. It is only honorable in situations like these to do so.

You have been thoroughly fooled. Bitcoin was about one thing from the very first moment of inception: taking power away from the banking cartel. Decentralization, permissionlessness, and public key encryption were all just tools in helping achieve this end. Satoshi encoded that newspaper headline about the financial crisis from 2009 into the blockchain so nobody would ever forget it.
What you are doing now is helping to give the biggest and most powerful banks in the world even more power. Why are you working towards the opposite goal of Bitcoin? Did you ever care about taking power away from the banks at all?

Spread is referring to the difference in BTC prices between China and the rest of the world, which is about $20 right now. You can easily trade coins from one exchange to another; therefore, somebody will buy from outside of China (raising price) and then sell them on the exchanges in China (lowering price) for $20 profit minus fees. Since we are in a decent rally the prices in China will probably not be lowered by much and the prices outside will rise significantly. 
Basically, people who are short-selling in either market are likely to get squeezed out of their trades and lose a lot of money right now. How long this keeps up is anybody's guess at this point. Seems like there might be some institutional investors constricting supply by purchasing huge amounts of bitcoin directly from the mining pools or indirectly from them via Gemini.

Wallet A (your original wallet) sends 10 bitcoins to Wallet B (the coin mixer's wallet). Wallet C (also owned by the coin mixer) then sends 10 bitcoins to Wallet D (your new wallet). That is basically how coin mixing works but there are usually lot more wallets in the middle of the process. When you go from Wallet B to Wallet C, that is the part which is off-chain.
This is just one type of off-chain transaction. Exchanges and services like Changetip also do off-chain transactions.

My statement:
"The government is now authorized, by law, to kill USA citizens without any sort of trial at all, anywhere in the world, by remote with a drone or any other method.
We couldn't possibly be living in scarier times. Nothing surprises me anymore these days except how oblivious everybody around me stubbornly remains."
Your response:
"What still surprises me is the "US citizens" in your statement. If they kill other people in the same fashion, it's not such a big deal?"
How you came to think that a suitable response would be to form your question as if I had a possible bias against foreigners is beyond me. It would be like if you mentioned a person of your racial background that was killed the other day and didn't mention a person of any other race being murdered, and then I asked if you thought people of other races being murdered was such a big deal.

Are you joking? Of course they believe in regulation. They come from a family with a legacy that has been in the upper crust of society for a very long time. If they simply cast aside all financial traditions then they would probably be ostracized for it.
You are also being quite vague in your criticism. When they said that bitcoin should be regulated, they didn't mean bitcoin itself, as in the entire network plus the mining operations. They meant that financial institutions, like exchanges and remittence services, should be regulated to either snuff out illegal activity or keep the government from trying to shut everything down.
Don't worry one bit. Bitcoin will orbit about regulations for a little while like a satellite orbits Jupiter before being flung out of the Solar System at super speed. The Winklevii are helping us get our claws into the old financial system. We need the increase in capital to make the network stronger.

They are both theories. The theory in this thread states that price is likely to go down because the MMM scheme was sucking up all the coins on the market.

10% is not the usual premium. 
I disagree with your last point entirely. There is a perfectly justified reason that people are paying marked up prices for coins right now, and that is because we are still in the very early stages of bitcoin development. Core devs have done a fantastic job at getting it ready for mainstream audiences, and we are now waiting for apps to be built for access and ease of use. Things are moving along perfectly well and show no sign of slowing down. 
If we were to look at the world from your apparent mindset, there is absolutely no reason that anyone should be able to print out endless amounts of USD whenever they please and then just give it all to their banking friends. There is no reason other than greed, and, on that point, I fully agree with you.

Entanglements, a concept of quantum theory, state that the quantum properties of two atoms, even when separated by a distance measured in light-years, may be instantaneously shared. Scientists in the Netherlands claim to have found a way to use an entanglement in order to 'teleport' the quantum state, or the qubit data, of one atom to another atom over a short distance of three meters and are working on increasing this distance up to 1km. If successful, this method of data transmission could potentially be used to sync the blockchain across the solar system.

(5+10) / 2 = 7.5 minutes between buys = 1.33 buys per block reward on average
10 coins / 25 coins [block reward] = .4
19 coins / 25 coins [block reward] = .76
0.4 [portion of block reward purchased per buy] * 1.33 [buys per block] = 0.532
0.76 [portion of block reward purchased per buy] * 1.33 [buys per block] = 1.0108
If the numbers stated about the Willy buys were correct, then the bot was purchasing about 50% to 100% of the block reward for every block that was mined, which was significantly more than 20% to 40%.

1. Time to walk up to counter
2. Greeting the cashier
3. Ordering items "Do you have a..." "I'll have one jumbo dog with cheese and two chilli cheese dogs with three large..."
4. Cashier completing input of order
5. Cashier reporting final price total
6. Scanning bitcoin QR code and sending coins
7. Cashier retrieving items from cook/printing tickets/bagging gift shops items
8. Saying goodbye and walking away
9. Next customer repeats the process
If you think all of that takes significantly more or less than 30 seconds when done efficiently, then I just can't argue with you. My estimate doesn't account for transaction errors, small talk, confusion with the ordering process, language barriers, or any of the other myriad of things that can make a single transaction often take up to a minute. 
I was low-balling the math on purpose so that no sensible person would accuse me of overestimating what bitcoin can handle. As it stands, a 1MB block size can handle 100 cash registers constantly moving at a very efficient pace, which they normally do not, and I can't think of a single sports stadium that even has 100 cashiers in total, even if you count the vendors walking amongst the crowd selling beer.

He wasn't lying about that. A tiny portion of coins was lost due to their poor handling of that "bug". However, that doesn't mean he wasn't incompetent. Karpeles admitted to losing his laptop on a park bench by accident and having some random person return it to him.
I know this might be hard to understand for some people, but when you are responsible for a half-billion dollars, then you lose the luxury of being able to use your laptop in a city park for fear of losing it. That is the reason Warren Buffet barely ever leaves his house. It's always a risk for anybody, and a far bigger risk when you have more assets.

I'm quite sure that my understanding is a misinterpretation since I've neither studied physics nor read the research articles about this particular experiment, but this is exactly what I read:
Premise 1. Entanglement occurs instantly (or almost instantly), across the entire span of the universe.
Premise 2. The researchers and/or the author of this NYT article claim that this transfer of quantum data was accomplished using entanglement.
Conclusion. Therefore, the transfer of data was at least FTL, and possibly as fast as having zero transfer time.
Where did I misinterpret this article or argument?

For some, the only thrill they can get out of life is by doing something criminally dangerous, be it a robbery at gunpoint or a scheme with obvious clues thrown about on purpose. If that were the case, and you were addicted to the adrenaline of the danger or the chase, then you could think the consequences forever and you would always end up with two options: 1) feel dead inside with absolutely nothing to live for or 2) do something criminal and feel alive inside.
I agree that most criminals probably don't think about the consequences of their actions enough and make mistakes on accident. However, some genuinely love doing it just to feed their ego and make mistakes on purpose to further that.

You can help us get started and build things faster. Andreas' book and the Princeton-based free online course are two great places to start. It is a little difficult to understand at first, but anybody with a passion for computers can get the hang of it after the first few chapters/weeks.
I agree completely that people should have direct access to the blockchain, and they absolutely will, but not likely as their main payment mechanism. Bitcoin is perfectly suited to be the reserve currency of every country, bank, and individual, but not necessarily the currency used to buy lunch and a movie ticket. It will be used exactly the way that gold should be used today: mostly kept in a vault but still able to be spent at a moment's notice if needed.
tl;dr We're working on it, and we'll get there soon enough.

Do you know how much of a miner's fee the BTM pays for each transaction? If they set it too low then that could slow down confirmation times. Best case scenario is they set it up to respond to market pressure so the fee will be raised if the backlog grows in size.

The no-communication theorem states that a transfer of even a fraction of a bit is impossible under entanglement, regardless of the speed of the transmission. The experimenters in the NYT article claim that this was achieved, but are not yet sure of the speed of transfer.

Because bitcoin is the reserve commodity of the internet. Real currency, which is always and only backed by a limited reserve commodity (gold/silver), is essentially a side chain or off chain transaction of whatever is backing it. When the dollar was an actual currency, it was essentially a side chain or off chain form of gold. That does not, in any way, reduce the absolute necessity for the blockchain or gold standard.
