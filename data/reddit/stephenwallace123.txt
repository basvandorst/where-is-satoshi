No. I'm just making the point that BTC bounces around a lot. In any given month it can go thru a wide range of prices. If a TA can make an educated guess as to where BTC will be in 3 months, 6, 9. Then it's not much of a stretch to make a list of prices and guess BTC will be passing  thru these prices on any given month (from a TA perspective). If the person guesses all 6 months correctly then it's impressive TA at best. Nothing else.

They are trying. At least they are trying. That's all that matters. They are not lolling in their ignorance.

What does btfd mean? But the fucking dip?

I'm an old man and I get bitcoin. Just cause you're old don't mean you don't get it.

BTC was also $13,200, $12,200, $11,200 and $10,200 in July. "teeth suck"

Sapiens is a great read. If you liked that read Eric Fromm's "the sane society" there's a 140 page chapter on capitalism. I am trying to read as many different takes on money and currency as I can

True. As George gilder says in life after Google...."all you need to stay ahead of the curve is curiosity. Everything else will follow" he is 80 and has his finger on the pulse of big tech. ��

I'm concerned about the fact that i feel smarter than the sitting president of the united states.

Doubtful. But it's coming.

Love this!

This is why BTC alone won't work as a currency. Store of value yes. But why buy something today when u can buy more of it tomorrow.
@_date: 2019-09-16 20:51:16
Yes that's my point exactly. A miner is not going to hang onto BTC if it is more likely going to go down in price. They will off load as quickly as possible in a bear market thus fuelling the bear. This is what happened in dec 18'

 Don't forget that 1800 BTC are being produced every day. So these are also being bought up in order to keep the price constant. If not then capitulation occurs. Like we had during miner capitulation at 6k.

I have had the same problem. My account was terminated without and explanation and they indicated that my funds would be re appropriated to my bank ac asap. I can only hope that they do as they say. When I contact their customer service by phone they tell me it is a different department dealing with the issue and that they can't help me.
