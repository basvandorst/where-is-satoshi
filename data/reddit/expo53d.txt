Bitcoins, surely!

I'm actually doing something very similar for my IT class. We were tasked with creating a database for a fictitious company of our choice. Most students went for something like a flower shop, car salesroom, etc.
Having been a member of this subreddit for quite a while, I thought to myself "what the hell, why don't I design a database for a bitcoin exchange". I explained bitcoin to my IT teacher (who was unfamiliar with the currency). My teacher was quite excited about it. I've just begun work on my project. Wish me luck!

Bitcoin uses identifiable addresses. If you can link an address to an identity, then all the anonymity advantage is lost.


How exactly does this help illegal activities? All the encryption does is secure your money. All the transactions are still stored publicly in the keychain.
I do believe that you are however overall correct. Some examples of the issues that arise with bitcoin are the lack of government control and the inability to reverse transactions (in the case of fraud, etc). But it is these very features that make bitcoin appealing: no government can devalue your savings by printing money or otherwise inflating the currency.

Not necessarily: That is the location of the first computer that relayed the transfer to Blockchain.info. The website is directly connected to only 1% of all active nodes.

One large problem for these workers in actually acquiring bitcoins. Most of these workers can't sign-up at an exchange and have their cash/bitcoin exchanged. Even for the business owners, verification processes tend to be more troublesome when you're in a developing country.

Senator Kirk literally said that line during a hearing on Bitcoin.

I guess my bank account (stored as an entry in some MySQL database) isn't real too.

I'm guessing mining was a lot easier back then, no?

Though if the bitcoin value shoots up, the transaction fee ('dust' fee) should become lower, right?

Being the resident of a 3rd world country, actually getting any bitcoins has proven really tricky for me. Locabitcoins doesn't list any cash sellers in my area, and many websites aren't too verification-friendly with developing countries. I think this is a large part of the adoption gap in those countries.

Using the tip bot here on reddit should be fine though, right?
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:18:02
Can someone explain to me how this tipping thing works?

But where did all those bitcoins come from?
