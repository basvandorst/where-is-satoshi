thanks for tip. Hey it's a global market. Don't hate the player hate the game, this happens across all markets. China has been putting assets into everything it seems like because their position is only getting stronger and it's in our interest (republican here, TRUMP HATER) to do business with them. Making china stronger might also keep russia in check since many parties are involved. Also what makes China's power so strong is their almost authoritian state government which almost acts as a sole corporation making their state oil/infrastructure/tech stock worth way more than other U.S corporates who go to war with each other.

true, it's hard to determine actual market of strength of eastern vs western countries in general cause of key difference in fundamental systems of belief and gov but things are becoming more globalized.

the deposit was done using electrum, my armory wallet was randomly deleted with all the funds still on the wallet
@_date: 2017-06-27 06:10:09
also this armory wallet deletion was when weird things started happening and it was right after a moderate size withdrawal was made from paxful

what's more is that if i was hacked and they some how knew everyone about me why are my bitcoins still  on paxful? imo online exchanges are safest place for btc

how would it be a change though if i just checked my wallet online?
