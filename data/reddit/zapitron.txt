People have been saying that for fifty years.

DMCA passed in the late 1990s and outlawed certain code functionality. It turned out to be absolutely non-toxic to all the politicians who voted for it. with no negative consequences for any of 'em.  And now many people have had over a decade and a half to absorb that it's "normal" for the government to say how a computer is allowed to operate.
So not only can certain data be illegal, but tools that are compatible with the data can be illegal.  And voters have _already_ accepted this basic idea; there's no future-tense speculation needed for that aspect of the problem.

Your scam should work equally well with bananas or gold or cocaine or whatever -- so therefore hundreds of people before you have tried it over the last few decades, and the IRS surely got the precedents it needs, to handle the old "_I_ did not really own the asset when it gained value" trick.
But aside from that...
Near as I can tell, you now have (assuming it went from $500 to $700) $20k in fiat money that you need to hide under your bed, _and_ you admitted sending $70k to a mysterious foreigner on a boat.  You might not have to do time as a drug trafficker, but your house and other assets (including the $20k under the bed, if they find it) have been seized until after you prove your innocence.  Burden's on you.

Bitcoin isn't just math; it's a [social consensus]( too. Within the bitcoin community, decisions are sometimes made, and so far everyone has gone the same way.  Probably because there's a common attitude within the niche community, about what's "right."
Suppose Amazon, Wal-Mart and CostCo start accepting bitcoin, and you (and _lots_ of other people) get habituated to doing business with one or more of them on a routine basis.  You pay bitcoin to fuel your car, you buy your groceries with bitcoin, you go to the pub after work and buy a pint of IPA with bitcoin.  Not only you (the 2013 bitcoin "enthusiast") but also your father's cousin's former roommate's 14 year old daughter uses bitcoin too, to buy those cute new shoes she saw at the store.  She used bitcoin because it was expedient.  She wasn't thinking about fiat money vs real money; she was spending what she _had_ and what the store _accepts_.
Government can put lots of pressure on small numbers of individual entities, and some of those individual entities may have lots of market power.  Now suppose one of those aforementioned "decisions" occurs, where Amazon, Wal-Mart and Costco (as well as that teenage girl's shoe store) are encouraged (by having guns pointed at their heads) to adopt a certain blockchain policy fork over others.
Do you want _your_ bitcoins to keep working at Costco, or do you value freedom over convenience, and go with the mainstream-incompatible fork?  Are you willing to switch from bitcoin _back_ to dollars the next time you buy your groceries, because your grocery store uses the new "responsible bitcoin" fork instead of the old "freedom bitcoin" fork?  Or will you take the _easy_ way out?

Is the US, it's also common practice for people to write contracts which contain "small print" or which contain copious verbosity, for the very purpose of discouraging people from paying attention to the terms.

No, not every currency.  Through careful research, I looked into the small black shells (not the medium-size brown ones!) on the island of Lesser Palau in the south Pacific ocean, which are sometimes traded for fishnet repair supplies.
I employed lengthy interviews with all the natives who used the currency, asking "Are these shells associated with money laundering? What do you think of, when I ask you about these shells?" and zero of them reported the shells having any association with money laundering.  I grilled them for hours, and didn't find the faintest money laundering association.
So I think I found a counter-example to your claim that it applies to any currency.
Unfortunately, another researcher visited the island three weeks later, to corroborate my research.  When _he_ asked the natives to list the first things that came to their minds about the shells, they cringed and said "Money laundering, money laundering!  Please!  Please, stop pestering us.  Money laundering!"
I cannot explain this.

You need to expand on this part of the story if you don't want the overall story to sound like a joke. (although the part about "investing" in bitcoins already sounded a bit jokey, since it ended up being about buying bitcoins instead of funding the design of ASICs  .. but whatever.  I supposed currency speculation is still viewed as "investments" by _some_ kinds of people.  It's a big, strange world with _lots_ of bizarre ideas, some of them valid in spite of most peoples' common sense and experiences to the contrary.  Arrogance rarely pays and I'll be the first person to admit _my_ arrogance rarely helps me, either.  So, currency speculation as investment: fine, whatever floats your boat.)
By expand on the story, I mean explain why your friend was using that particular service, and *how* you initially  determined that the service was trustworthy.  That a random shadow turned out to be a shadow, is totally uninteresting in itself; that sort of thing has been going on, for literally _thousands_ _of_ _years_.  What would be far more interesting, is what verification techniques ended up failing you.  But you don't say anything about what techniques they were, and how they were subverted.
Indeed, you present the story as being like you walked up to some stranger in the park, asked him to hold a few hundred euros for you, and he agreed.  The next day you went back, and couldn't find the stranger.  But of course, that's a totally unfair characterization of your story, right?
*Right?*  Please, _go_ _on_.  Finish your story.

If he's not qualified to make changes to the proposal, then the bank isn't qualified either.  And he _didn't_ make changes to any legal agreement, because prior to his changes, there _was_ no agreement.  That's why he changed it.

What do you mean by "unauthorized?"  The entirety (100%) of the original contract that the bank offered him, was "unauthorized."  Nobody needs authorization to make an offer to someone else. Nor did he alter a contract; he altered a _proposal_.  People do that all the time and there's nothing even slightly illegal about it.
I do agree that what he did was sneaky and deceptive and you might have a valid point about fraud there.  But it has nothing to do with authorization or lack thereof.  It's merely a question of whether or not he thought the bank would read his proposal in detail, and most people are going to think that _he_ thought they wouldn't read it.  (And the fact that bank _didn't_ read his offer, supports this.)  _That_ is what may end up getting it ruled as fraud.

Ugh.  If I ever received an email that said I had just received som--DELETED.  I can't even finish the sentence because I delete the email as spam bef--DELETED.  Uh oh, I can't even talk abo--DELETED.
If you send someone bitcoins this way, _tell_ them first.

$35 was hours ago.  Now the free shipping threshold is up to $46.52.
