Keep an eye on it. I see a lot of money being pumped into companies thats involved with bitcoin. Always follow where the money is going, and right now its into crypto currencies - especially bitcoin. I think April, May and June will be interesting. From the history of the prices, when it shoots it shoots.

Quote: "Fractional reserve banking involves the creation of money by the commercial bank system, increasing the money supply. According to the quantity theory of money, this larger money supply leads to more money 'chasing' the same amount of goods, which leads to a higher price level"
So higher price level is called inflation. Note that inflation can also be caused by many other factors too.

It will happen. Crytpo currencies is giving Government money competition now. They have to adapt and change or they will die slowly. Just think of the internet and mail/telephone/travelling etc etc When the internet came, those mail/telephone/travelling was under competition. They either have to adapt or die. If you had a telephone company and didnt adapt, you would have slowly died. Mail is also a good example. Lots of people slowly stopped sending letters and started sending parcels instead. I think Government money is under competition from Crypto Currencies now, which is a good thing. They no longer have a monopoly on money, which is good to the people, as they abuse their power way too much.

Wise words yourself! Crypto technology is amazing. What people considers money is amazing. 2 factor authentication is amazing. Multisignature is amazing. Stealth addresses is amazing. I can go on and on ... No wonder Governments and Central Banks dont like all these awesome innnovation. Its like the Telephone Companies saying the Internet is bad. I feel sorry for those that do not understand what Bitcoin and bitcoin is. Its like people who dont use the internet now days ... they are missing SO much the world is offering!

If you lived in Cyprus when their Government froze all their people's bank account for about 2 weeks ... dont you think thats dangerous for the people? Can you imagine not being able to send/receive any money? Imagine you had to buy dinner and found out your cards have been frozen ... thats a disaster. I know Cyprus is not a big country, but imagine if it happened to your country (not that it would, but its dangerous)...and if it doesnt happen, your Government can just print money and all its people will have to pay that hidden tax called inflation. Poor people get hurt the most.

Go to twitter and search bitcoin atm ( - you will see lots of reports on ATM being launched (Hong Kong, United States Emirates, Singapore, America, etc etc - I think the total is in the hundreds of not thousands of ATMs now). The latest is the one that doesnt even deal in cash - they just deal with credit cards and bank accounts. Very interesting ... and thats in Australia ( If you can get stats for retail transaction, let me know. Its very hard to find. The list of Merchants accepting is unknown. There is no central place that all Merchants sign up to - since the system is decentralised.

If you see it or not, its your choice. Other people see it and believe in it, and thats what money is all about. People is giving value to crypto currencies now and they can use it as an exchange for something else (thats what money is all about). If you do not believe in it, then you do not value it and hence, its not money to you and wont be a currency to you. Either way, you have the right to watch and see how it goes.
You cannot compare the tech bubble 2.0 with crypto currencies. There are SO MUCH philosophy behind crypto currencies whereas the tech bubble not so.
From my perspective, Governments are ABUSING their power and the people has had enough of that. This is a step to giving power back to the people.

Bitcoin adoption will be more slow in low income countries - as they do not have the technology of the internet and lots of computers. However, mobile phones are becoming increasingly popular with these countries - and this can pave a new way of using bitcoin for cheap mobile phones (eg Africa). Over time, it will be more easy to use bitcoins as more Developers are creating the software to go with the hardware. At least the low income countries can start interacting with the rest of the world in online commerce as bitcoin can be used by anybody with no restrictions, whereas for example paypal is restricted in certain countries.
Back to the question, the low income countries will use mobile phones to do bitcoin transactions, and it will be individuals to individuals ... until volume grows so much that companies and businesses will start to take over.

You dont need to worry if Bitcoin or bitcoin has intrinsic value. Money does not need to have intrinsic value at all for it to be used as money. As long as its useful as a form of exchange for something of value, people will use it. Since it cant be printed, cheap to send, fast to send, and many other benefits, a lot of people are demanding it and since supply is limited, there will be value.

All those companies that deal with sensitive data,  they should use ACID to keep their data secured - Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability ( So in the above case where there are 2 servers doing 2 transactions, when 1 of the server does a transaction it locks the data - if another server attempts to spend - the data is locked down so it will not work. Only when the transaction is finalised and all data is went through, then it updates the finalised data. If you are saying what if 2 transaction is processed at the same time - by using ACID it will not process. One will process but not both.

Its the network effect. If you have 100 million people accepting bitcoin, and someone makes another copy - they have zero people accepting bitcoin. Its hard for them to gain ground. However, if the new altcoin is good, they can gain ground and open and healthy competition is a great thing as it always leads to innovation.

Jsn7821 has to wait 5 weeks for a cheque to clear. Thats too long. If he was paid in bitcoin, he would have received it within the hour. So 1 hr to 5 weeks is a HUGE difference. Sanswork - when money is insured it is paid by everybody. When there is not enough money in that insurance box, then the Government will take MORE money from tax payers - so its a double hit. Whats happen in the US is that their insurance money is being used up, and those Banks that should have closed down long time ago due to mismanagement are continuing to operate because they are being paid by the Tax Payers to bail them out of their troubles. Both of you are right, but are just have different context with your discussion.

they close your bank accounts for sending money to someone? Thats very rude. Its impossible to trace why you sent them money in the first place for so there is no reason for them to close your bank account. If you are worried, just make another bank account with a different bank and transact with that one - so your main bank account is safe.

For example, if you turn on your bitcoin wallet, it has addresses embedded in it that searches for the blockchain. This is where all the transactions are stored. IT verifies with other locations if its the correct blockchain. Then you start to sync to the correct blockchain. If at any time you are looking at a copied version of bitcoin, it will pick it up and reject it. It only sync with the real true bitcoin. I hope this helps.
@_date: 2014-03-15 02:51:28
I dont think you need anything to backup money. If a lot of people uses it, there will be demand for it. Its pure demand and supply, and since everybody knows you cant just print bitcoin like you can print Government Money, then demand will slowly but surely move away from those printed money into real money. Nobody forces people to use bitcoin, but Government forces you to use their printed money. Its a scam right there. Inflation the hidden tax. It hurts the poor more than the rich, and thats a bad tax for the general people.

There are other uses other than currency. I think all the Developers are going wallets and exchanges - that means payment systems. After that is done, those ATMs are going to roll out eventually and once thats done, prices will stablises more.

There are data of volume being transacted which seems to be trending upwards, but true figures is hard to find.

So far, adoption seem to be uptrending.

There's so much insider trading happening with people in the Whitehouse and Regulators now ... the only difference is that they are pretending there is no insider trading and letting the Public believe that there is no insider trading when it is happening. Regulation wont fix it. Let the market kill those bad companies and let the strong ones survive. In your case, that crowfunded company will die - people will loose money and those with insider info will make money. Those that lost money will know how bad that company is and will not invest in any of those people again and hopefully will let other people know how bad they are. On the other hand, another company will take over and win, and those that invested in them benefits. So only invest in companies that have a proven track record.

Why do you need a multisig wallet for? Lots of wallets havnt caught up to the new feature yet, so its best to wait if what you require is not urgent. Online wallets - even if they have multisig - its still dangerous as there are other attack points (eg their Admin accounts getting hacked or someone faking its you etc etc). Online wallets - never trust a new start up (or put tiny coins in there only). You dont know who they are or what their main purpose is.

Bitcoin is bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies is all cryptocurrencies including bitcoin. Gold is gold. Precious metals is all precious metals including gold. So just so you cannot just duplicate another bitcoin as there is only 1 bitcoin - same with gold. You cannot just duplicate gold. Both are in limited supply, and unlike gold, bitcoin's limit is known in advance. So you can create another crypto currency that copies bitcoin, but its not the real thing...just like you cannot create another metal and call it gold. So another words, cryptocurrencies supply can be unlimited but bitcoin is limited.

Money is a method of exchange. If you and I consider bitcoin to be money, then we can trade good/services for bitcoin and that is money. You do not need any intrinsic value for money, as long as people believe its money then it is money. More and more people are using crypto currencies because they believe that its money - that means they can trade a good or service for the crypto currency, and that crypto currency can give them another good or service. Thats what money is. You do not need any intrinsic value for something to be money.

0% transaction fees for the Retailer? That is a lot when you think about it. A Retailer can pay fees on Savings/Cheque (20 cents per transaction in Australia) account AND fees on Credit cards (average 2% of sales). It can save them easily $500/mth in fees depending on the volume.
Traditional Banks on the other hand wants to charge fees and make record profits time and time again - thus sucking the money out of the economy and when they loose a ton of money, they ask for Tax Payers money to pay for it all.

If you can find somebody that copied bitcoin like you said, let me know and see if anybody else follows them. I highly doubt it.

It doesnt make sense. If you buy 1 share for 1 btc, thats 1 share at a price of 1btc. Dividend payouts depends on the companies profits. It will change with the time. If they are paying high dividends, then more investors will invest as the income to share is good. This means their share price will go up and you have a market profit as your shares went up. If they do not pay dividends, then shareholders loose interest and sell as their btc investment is not giving them any money back. Shares cannot be compared to a car as a car depreciates in value, whereas these Shares are linked to the company's health.

I understand what you mean. So basically you are saying if they are living in Cyprus and trading in Euros, then if they paid their profits in bitcoins, they have to convert Euros to bitcoins first, and if bitcoins is high in value then the return is low. So what happens when that company only transact in bitcoins? Their profits is in bitcoins and so the it doesnt matter if its high or low as its all in terms of bitcoins? I think thats what Neo is about - they want to move away from the Euros when their Banks can be frozen again by their Government.
@_date: 2014-03-23 00:52:23
Yes. Governments cant print it. The supply of bitcoins is fixed, and lets hope it stays that way. There is no account charges unlike how Banks charges their fees. Poor people in poor countries can have access to bitcoin whereas Banks will charge them too much. Credit cards are restricted to a lot of people, so they cant do internet transactions, so bitcoin is good for them. The list goes on and on. ITs a great innovation.

There are dollars, yuan, australian dollars, Indian Rupees etc etc. Then there are crypto conversions  &lt;-- that site you can convert a lot of different types of crypto money into another crypto money. So what you are seeing is that money is now moving away from Government printed money, and into crypto money.
People dont buy bitcoin with just dollars now, people can buy bitcoin with lots of other forms of money. Bitcoin's value is determined by real market supply and demand. There is no doubt that more and more people consider crypto currencies money now.

Yes thats great news. I have also heard of M-Pesa. Problem with that is they cannot transfer their money into the other parts of the world. It is technically their currency. There could be a market that exchanges M-Pesa to bitcoin and back...you never know. The good thing is that the barrier of entry is low so anybody that has a good idea and can transform it into reality can start (since bitcoin is decentralised).

Ok. So you mean having a versocard is a process? This is technically hardware - you have a card that has a QR code of your private and public key. Its a security and also a process.

I would not trust savegox. John wants to be the CEO but dont know how to run a bitcoin exchange and have no passion in running a bitcoin exchange - he will fail. They will just suck the profits out of the company - thats all they want - profits. MtGox exchange is a dead software - to fix their old software will be stupid as its insecured - I would not trust using that at all ... and for them to start up their own software is not going to work as they dont even have one operating now - so they have no experience. OKcoin deal sounds good - if that goes through at least you KNOW their software is secured and they have experience in running a bitcoin exchange, and people will use the new exchange.

Bitcoin solves a problem in the first world of less exchange fees if you pay internationally.

Say BTC increased by 10 times. If you had BTC then its the same amount, only that you can convert it to other currencies and buy a lot more. In terms of Share Price, it will be the same. It just mean there will be less demand by those that do not own any BTC as they have to convert it first into BTC and that means, they have weak buying power.
 If you were trading with only BTC, then it would not matter (just think of you using your own local money, you do not care if it increased 10 times or not as everything is priced in your local money). However, when you are converting with other currencies, then exchange rate will take affect. People will demand more BTC as its giving extra value compared to the Euros. More people will move into their system, and giving the network effect it will increase their usage. So hopefully if Neo and Bee manages themselves correctly and grow and start giving giving those zombie banks competition.
