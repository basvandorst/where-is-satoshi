Perhaps I’m orchestrating an elaborate trap 10 years in advance, and I’m actually employed by the central intelligence organization known as Satoshi Nakamoto.
It’s all just psychological manipulation. 
The gears have been set in motion.
 
The secrets lie here

Got backup dragons.

Wish me luck. I hope I won’t go through that.
@_date: 2019-11-26 02:16:28
Anything is possible I guess...

That's a good thing. That means that there's a lot of money to be had for us folk.  
If everyone already knew bitcoin was amazing, we wouldn't have the same opportunity.

They’re purely decorative :)

Even if you open the chest, you still have to break the Trezor encryption :P

I like dogecoin more to be honest. I have plenty though.  
Almost got 100 doges.

And then put the aquarium in a box and get Elon to send it to the moon

Do you really think someone is going to target me in a possible future for having bought some coins? Lol.

“Pretty much certain”?
Even if it goes to the moon, at most I’ll be a well off millionaire. It’s not like millionaires these days are in hiding.
You can spot them fairly easily given where they live and whatnot.
And it’s not like we will degenerate into a Madmax type of world.
Right? What am I missing here.

The treasure chest contains a Trezor wallet and some
physical crypto coins. Wallet is safe.

I like it because the community is great lol. Sure beats this apparently.

Dreams never die though :P One day...

Erebor. It’s northeast of Rhovanion.

It's like 15 bucks. Same as a nice necklace you'd get in a thrift shop.

Why? I'm just throwing a funny theory out there.
Namely that Satoshi Nakamoto (Central Intelligence), is a pseudonym used by the Illuminati.  
And Bitcoin is the light that grows steadily in the distance.
I didn't realize Bitcoin people get offended over a random funny theory, Lol
Dogecoin people would say "wow" instead :P
@_date: 2019-10-29 08:00:50
The light is called Bitcoin, lol
