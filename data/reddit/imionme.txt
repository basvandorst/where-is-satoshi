While I appreciate the condescending tone of your comment, I should point out a few things:
1. I do not understand *exactly* how bitcoin works; hence the *question*.
2. Everyone else who replied seemed to have no problem answering the question, and didn't even have to be a douchebag about it.
3. Judging by your comment, I don't think you even understand what I was asking. I appreciate you taking the time to explain, but it does not tell me anything as far as the question I asked. Again, that is probably *my* fault for asking such a lousy question. Perhaps the inclusion of the letter *h* in the word *what* in the title threw you off.
Regardless, your comment moves me one step closer to RES tagging all of the douchebag assholes on reddit as such, and I thank you for that.

Right, I just wanted to make sure I was understanding correctly. Thanks for your earlier explanation.

Just in case anyone is not aware... [Bitzino]( seems to be a great start. You can only play against the house... but maybe that will change in the future.

Thank you all for the responses. So if I am understanding correctly, you may be able to re-create their wallet and it would show the bitcoins they've already received (it would gather this from the blockchain)... but there would ultimately be no way for you to spend their bitcoins unless you had their private keys. I realize the blockchain is public information so you would not necessarily gain anything by doing this... other than the illusion that you had their bitcoins in your wallet. Is that correct?

Ok, how about givemeyourcarandiwillgiveyouonebitcoin.com or letmesleepwithyourwifeforonebitcoin.com? I just want to get on board with your awesome idea!
You should have a link to bitmit on your site. That way after someone spends $90 on a $60 bitcoin, they can go buy a $10 CD walkman with it!

Risk of what? Price volatility? You shouldn't be in the business of selling bitcoins then. Risk of chargebacks? In that case you would still be losing 100% of the money so whether you lose $60 or $90, you still end up with $0. Or is ripping off everyone covering for the few that may do chargebacks? Do you have statistics to show the justification for such a markup?
Frankly, I would have given you a little credit if you said it was to cover credit card processing fees or something (although your price is still absurdly high.) I'd honestly love to hear more about this "risk" you are covering in your noble pursuit of "helping people."

Ok so to clarify, there are no "risks", right? That was bullshit just like the "helping people" bit. You're offering a service to people that are either naive or incapable of buying them at market price for some reason, which is fine. But if you go around posting links to it under the guise of "helping people" and I see it I'm going to reply and call it what it is. If helping people was your motive you would be giving them a fair price (and I know "fair" is subjective, but 150%?! You make the guys on Pawn Starts look reasonable!)
I wish you lots of success and even more chargebacks.

You're selling one bitcoin at a time through Google checkout for a ~50% markup? Yeah please hurry, I *can't wait* for that!
I'm gonna start a project called buybitcoinswithpaypalfortripletheprice.com. Maybe we can swap ads!
@_date: 2013-03-23 16:28:06
Yes, I will give you $20 for it.
Or you can setup an account on Mt.Gox (or another exchange). They'll give you a wallet address linked to your account that you can send the bitcoin to. Once it shows up in your account, you can place a sell order for whatever amount you'd like (although if it's too high nobody will buy it.)

That is my problem with you. I'd normally have no problem with people asking however much they want for a bitcoin. Hopefully nobody pays what you're asking but you're free to ask it.
But the "*Patience folks, I'm working on it*" and "*I do it to help people*" is bullshit. Don't act like you're doing someone a favor charging them 150% of the current price. You're greedy. Own up to it and stop playing the "I do this for you people" card.
