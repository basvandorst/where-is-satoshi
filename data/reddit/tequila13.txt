In that case you probably know that keeping a Linux distro up-to-date is a trivial thing.

I agree with you partially. The bigger part of the bitcoiners look at bitcoin as a get-rich-quick scheme, most of them have no idea how the current fiat system works and why it benefits them.
But the rage against the existing system and its many artificial limitations and inefficiencies are justified. Even chaos seems a better alternative sometimes. You have to realize that many people don't give a fuck about money and monetary systems, and they don't want to get _on top_ of it. They want to get on with their lives, and they want money related things to be simple. Bitcoin (or another cryptocurrency) has the potential be a simpler system. It's not just "ideology be damned".
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:59:44

Your debit card can be charged even it it has a chip and PIN. Otherwise you wouldn't be able to use them for online shopping. The only difference is that transactions will fail if you don't enough money for the transaction to complete, while a CC will make you owe money to the bank.
With a POS you can initiate the transfer as the owner of the card. But it can be charged by anyone who knows the data visible on your card. Just a photo of both sides of the card is enough for an attacker. Of course you can cancel the charge at your bank.
But I agree with you, I only use debit cards online which have a minimal amount of money on them and I put money on it just before making a purchase. And I leave at home all my cards that have a lot of money on them, I only take them with me if absolutely necessary.
@_date: 2014-07-05 17:05:21
Wasn't that "bit" ? "BIT" looks like an acronym. "Bit" already has a gazillion meanings, and when you capitalize it randomly in mid sentence, and use singular when the context requires plural, it gets confusing really fast.
@_date: 2014-03-21 22:50:04
The analogy isn't quite fitting.  You can drive a car without being a mechanic and the same way you can use the internet without being a programmer.
But the bitcoin wallet needs to be accessible _while_ being very secure, and you cannot get away with not knowing anything about security. You can use an online service to keep your wallet secure. So far many many people have lost their money because each online service has its quirks and again the users needs to be aware of those. There's also the problem of the online services making a run with the money.
Banks are reliable because they're regulated, wallet-managing bitcoin institutions need to be regulated to have a somewhat trustworthy service. So far none of the site owners were held responsible for stealing bitcoins. The bitcoin community is heavily against any regulation.
The security aspect of cryptocurrencies is not an easy problem to solve.

I just see a huge wave of people from with their gifs that can't be bothered to learn the basic things about cryptography and computer security, but they're a big fan of bitcoin without understanding how it actually works. Their take on bitcoin is that they buy cheap, and sell  for a lot, and that's basically all they care about. "Spread the word about bitcoin because it's going to the moon". Guess what, if you can't secure your computer, all your money will be gone before you can blink. And I have a strong feeling that the crowd is not really security oriented and technical.
At this point you can't even _know_ if bitcoin will be around in 5 years. But you can still _use_ it. Even if bitcoin won't be around for long, you can still buy stuff today. All this stock market talk of buying/holding/selling/investing looks idiotic to me, but I don't care about money, I care about learning stuff. Those "stock market" type people annoy me because they talk and act like they know what they're talking about, but in reality they don't have a clue. Nobody _knows_ what the future is for bitcoin.

I see some confusion in your posts too. Just consider this for a second: ABP added its own default whitelist to override the community provided adlist. The community decided to block google ads, the ABP dev decided to override that **by default**. So if you want to block google ads, you need to confirm it **twice**, once by adding them to the filter list (done for you by the community) and uncheck the "allow unobtrusive ads".
If the filter list maker community thought that Google was good, they wouldn't put it on every single one of the popular lists, but a separate "unobtrusive ads" filter list. But there is no such filter list. Why?
Not to mention that ABP has an user-controlled whitelist feature, people can selectively allow sites they want, and they can override the filters.
What bothers me is that there is an ad-company sponsored list in my adblock plugin that overrides my list by default. Doesn't that sound sketchy at all for you?
EDIT: re-read your comment and it seems to me that you think ABP maintains the filter lists:


Just FYI these are **NOT** maintained by ABP, these lists are made by the community, you can find the maintainers here:  If you give money to ABP, none of your money will go to the maintainers of these lists.

I'm with you on this one. I can't explain why but image macros irk the shit out of me. The sad part is that the image macro crowd spreads like cancer to technical forums, and reduces the quality of the conversation and content. And it drives technical people away.
There are so many unanswered questions about bitcoin, and yet here we are looking at image macros with over 2000 points. And reading how people "play bitcoin" like they are on Wall Street and patting each other on the back. All the while they have no clue what computer security is about, and how cryptography works, and I would bet money that over 90% percent of the subreddit has no idea how to send an encrypted and signed email.

Why do people assume that a big HD is good only for pirating stuff?
If you do any kind of multimedia content creation (drawing/photography/video) you'll find that they will consume more than astronomical amounts of data.
Even if you're a programmer, working on opensource programs can easily consume several tens of GB of data. Compiling OpenWRT stands on 6 GB, Android is at 15 GB, Qt is over 3 GB, the linux kernel is t 1 GB, and so on.
If you use virtual machines, you'll get over 10 GB easily. And the list goes on.

You're misunderstanding it. Some people are offended by the spam. 5 cents is non-money for anyone who has a job, they see it on the ground, they won't pick it up. They don't care about the 5 cents you give them, but they might care that instead of engaging in the discussion they're in, you derail that discussion to bitcoin by giving away a non-amount of money.

I meant that you run Windows as a virtual machine on Linux. Modern CPU's have special instructions to assist with executing virtualized code, and hypervisors (virtual machine managers) taking advantage of these features can run OS's at 98-99% compared to native speeds, in real life you won't ever notice that your Windows runs in a virtual machine on a simulated hardware on Linux. It has nothing to do with piracy.
My point was that you can run Window on a Linux kernel. The WinXP kernel had special code to talk to the Linux kernel when it detected that it was running in a VM, it was a symbiosis between the two kernels, similar to what was dreaming about.

I can understand your standpoint, but misplacing a file is quite easy. Making your private key completely unaccessible to the outside world is quite difficult because it requires a lot of technical skill.
I like bitcoin and I wish for it to succeed, but I think the bitcoin crowd has their heads so high up in the clouds that they can't see the ground they're standing on.
Even big companies have difficulties securing their networks, how can you realistically expect an average Windows user understand how security works? Botnets are rampant, tens of millions of computers are infected, and people don't notice that they are part of botnets.
With bitcoin, if someone is able to read your private key, your money is gone forever. I'd consider that a big hurdle for bitcoin, and this subreddit just glosses over it like it's a non-issue.

If I want to be stalked on the Internet, I will ask for it. Google never asks, they just stalk you.

That's one of the things that few from the bitcoin crowd understand, they think they're on the stock market and investing in the hottest stock around.
And the other thing is that 99% are so blind sighted that they are **convinced**, they **know for certain** that the price can only go up.
And the third thing is that there seems to be very little awareness that the success of crypto currencies in general is very tightly related to well secured personal computers/phones/other devices which is a pipe dream at this point in time.

People don't get how this private key thing works and that's why I'm skeptical in bitcoins future. the rule is "*if anyone saw your private key, you can consider your money gone*". If you make backups of your key, you better be damn sure to have it properly secured.
The things you mention as backup are very insecure. For 0.3 BTC is not that important, but when people have more money than that, they won't know any better and still use the same insecure methods.

That would make sense if running a node wouldn't cost much. At low volume it's cheap, at high volume you'd have to spend several thousands dollars on a node. Storage for the blockchain is one issue. Another issue is the UTXO database is growing bigger and fully validating nodes want to keep in memory. Gavin wrote about that here: 
For now individuals can run a full node at little cost. With continued growth in 5 years it will probably be just businesses. I don't see the number of nodes going up, and as the other commenter pointed out, in 2015 it went down a lot already despite the growth in the number of users.

That works locally, and will remove the pruned node from the network. The shared blockchain, the one with the several thousand copies, was never pruned.

0-conf is as trivial to exploit as RBF would be. That's a fact. ANYONE can do AT ANY time what Peter Todd did. That's why he did it, as a reminder. 0-conf was and still is completely broken.

0-conf was running on GOOD FAITH from the very beginning. There's no feature called 0-conf in bitcoin. Vendors just ASSUMED that the customer will not spend their coins by the time the tx gets confirmed. It was like that FOR EVER. Bitcoin is not "instant pay", it never was.
It's astounding that so many people don't realize this. Frankly I don't like abusing the good faith of vendors, but it was high time that someone reminded them.

I'm similar, a long time dev, my interest in bitcoin is purely technical. I share the same observations as you. The BU code quality and their coding practices raise serious red flags, it's crazy to think how much money is on the back of shoddy code. I'm not a fan of BC either because of their political moves, but their code is at least sane.
Regarding your question about why BU wouldn't reuse the work done on BC, I think you answered it yourself, there's a political and a technical side to BU. On the technical side they lack experience, and on the political side their community wants nothing to do with BC, the whole r/btc sub is incredibly hostile. It's probably a combination of inexperience, ego and the pressure from their community, that causes the BU devs to fail to see that the the BC code is objectively in a better shape.
The bitcoin experiment turned out to be a lot messier than I thought 4-5 years ago. I was expecting that the biggest challenges to solve would be technical, I never anticipated there would be such a strong political side to it.

If you read the threads on Peter Todd's "double spend", you'd be shocked how people assumed he hacked Coinbase or exploited a bug, or similar. It wasn't even a double spend, there's one transaction on the blockchain, people and news outlets are still calling it a successful double spend, which is ridiculous.

I agree with most of your points, but disagree with some of them. There was many smaller isolated networks but they weren't competing directly with each other, rather they became interconnected over time. At the every level in the network stack there were ways for the networks to interoperate, token ring vs Ethernet, TCP/IP vs IPX, they could talk to each other in some form. I was there to see it, I know this first hand.
These are analogous to BTC vs Ethereum vs Ripple, etc. The Internet didn't have an opponent like the cryptocurrencies vs banks. The Internet didn't try to replace an already established technology, it was fundamentally new. Cryptos are trying to replace banks, they're direct opponents.
The Internet-cryptocurrency analogy would make sense if we had no way of transferring money over large distances until cryptos came around. In that case there would be potential for huge growth, but instead were talking about replacing existing frameworks with another one.
The Internet wasn't started with the intent of killing newpapers, media corporations, tv stations. It was a side effect. In fact these agencies themselves were using the Internet to transfer data. The cable companies themselves were making money in providing infrastructure for the Internet. There was no push against the Internet, nobody invested money in an effort to shrink the size of the Internet, it's ridiculous to even consider it.

You're talking about average Joe, it was clear to any techie that the Internet would grow. It was designed to grow and to scale. Bitcoin already faces severe scalability issues and it's just at the start of the road.
You should also consider that the Internet had no direct competitor in a technological sense, banks are strong competition for any cryptocurrency. In the US and poor countries banks might be shitty, but in Europe banks are much easier and more convenient to use than bitcoin. In many cases banks can even be cheaper too.

  * they don't mention anywhere clearly that the bundled miner will mine at a loss, instead they put a marketing spin on it:
    * "*the 21 Bitcoin Chip means your 21 Bitcoin Computer has access to a constantly replenished source of bitcoin*" &lt;- at a loss for the you, the customer, and at a gain for 21 Inc.
    * from the FAQ: "*Can you make a profit with the 21 Bitcoin Computer after accounting for energy costs? Yes, you can indeed make a profit with the 21 Bitcoin Computer. However, you would do so not by directly selling bitcoin, but by selling digital goods for bitcoin.* " &lt;- you need to sell things to make a profit, not by relying on mining (as that is a at a loss for you)
  * so much marketing speak: "*This should make sense: Bitcoin mining for the purpose of selling BTC on an exchange has the economics of a commodity business, while your globally accessible Bitcoin-payable API can have the economics of a software business.*" &lt;- seriously, wtf are they talking about
  * from the FAQ: "*For bulk purchasers interested in full datasheets, please email sales &lt;- gee, I can't wait to order in bulk of these $400 devices so I can find out what I bought. W T F ?! Who came up with that business plan??
  * the "Bitcoin Computer" can't be bought with bitcoin, hahaha

A future where millions of people will buy the phone with the lower battery life, because they believe in bitcoin. A future where hundreds of millions of people are ok with their devices eating up their Internet bandwith for the benefit of the bitcoin community.

It's not just electricity vs price of bitcoin in USD.
I understand that you hope for hashing power to stay the same, but it seems to me that a lot of miners will be forced to shut down. Some of the miners who did AMA's, gave numbers on how much they spent on equipment, electricity, taxes, rent, time spent on maintainence. Mining is not as a big cash cow as you seem to think.

A power source is [$2.47]( wifi adapter is [$3.39]( 16GB SD card is [$5.09]( tax and shipping is $0 for all these. You can cut out a case from cardboard, or if you want to spend money, you can buy one for [$4.99]( For a headless server I'm still at only $50. I wouldn't use it as a PC, so I don't need keyboard, mouse or monitor. I SSH into the box and make it do whatever I need. The webserver can be reached from the from a phone or a PC.
I used to run the webserver on an Arduino, but a Raspberry Pi is much more powerful, and not that more expensive and it still has pretty low power needs.
Even if you buy things from US stores at several times the eBay prices, you're looking at $100, which is still not bad (though it's more than what I'd pay for it). If you need a PC-like device, there are better options in r/linux_devices.

I'm a developer, I have several Raspberry Pi's and Odroids and use them to automate things around the house. But I don't find the 21 Inc. device appealing at all. There's zero technical information what this device actually is, how it works and NOTHING ABOUT AN API. The $400 device cost is gigantic for the rPi community. We are working with Arduinos that you can buy for $2.50 off eBay, even the rPi is a "big" machine at $35, I use that as a central server. The WiFi, LAN and radio adapters that I use cost $2-$5, sensors are all sub $10, most are sub $2.
I honestly don't get it why people keep saying that it's aimed for developers. I'm put off by the site itself, a lot of marketing speak, "buy" buttons plastered everywhere and no technical documentation anywhere. The developer documentation is just links to bitcoin.org, no developer documentation about the 21 computer. There's nothing so far that me, as a developer, can do with this device that I can't do on my PC. And I'm not paying $400 for a $35 Raspberry Pi.

Until the block reward is halved in a few months, then it will be $2 a month.
But more to the point, they are betting big on their proprietary marketplace, so I'm least least a bit curious how it looks before jumping to conclusions. My gut feeling is saying that it's dead in the water for several reasons:
  * marketplace works only with their device (no PC, no phones)
  * entry cost is $400 (the device)
  * many people are put of by the mining rig they can't control
  * the mining rig is a net loss for the user, the device won't pay for itself via mining
  * 21 Inc apparently will keep much of the mined bitcoins
  * very little actual information in general about 21 Inc and it's goals, but a huge amount of marketing and hype
So far I'm thinking they want to be something like eBay, live off sell fees and the coins mined by their userbase. But I don't see how that can possibly work with the huge entry cost. Nobody would use eBay if a user account would cost $400.

Bitcoin works because it doesn't need people to trust each other, only to trust math. Bitcoin math says that if a company is bigger than the others put together, they can game the blockchain and steal money. Harm can be done in a system that runs on good faith. For now and for ever.

I like your answer. Blockchain is just another database. I don't see why it's a big issue if a bank uses a blockchain for some of its operations in addition to the usual SQL databases. If their blockchain is private, it's still a blockchain and has all the properties of blockchains.

I don't have to imagine it, I live in an ex-communist country whose money got diluted by 10,000 times, I know exactly how it is like.
The fact is that if your family is so poor that they're on the limit of starvation (as per your title), then putting enough money into bitcoin, so that now it's their main source of income, was a really irresponsible decision. Bitcoin was a gamble, and is even today. You got lucky. That's your story.
You talk about the potential of bitcoin, but you're not using it to buy goods. You lucked out on your gamble. Having a thriving bitcoin economy in Venezuela is just as impossible as a dollar economy. They would ban bitcoin is enough people would be using it, and businesses couldn't take it even if they wanted to, just as they can't take dollars. 


You frame it like was the "free trade" aspect of bitcoin that made a difference in your life. It was the "buy bitcoin and hodl" gamble. Can you see the irony of someone praising the "free trade" aspect of bitcoin when he's not using it to buy things, but instead he's on the "hodl and sell high" bandwagon?
How has bitcoin benefited the Greeks? How did it protect them against their incompetent government? Where's the bitcoin economy in Greece? Why isn't Greece in the top of bitcoin charts if bitcoin could have protected them?

That is the thinking that slows down the growth. Money only has value as long as people trade it for actual goods. Trading with the only purpose of waiting for the price to go up is called "speculating" and leads to bubbles. Bubbles benefit only the smarter speculator, it keeps merchant adoption rate low, no business owner needs bubbles. It's plenty complicated to understand cryptocurrencies, these market games make for a bad experience.

You're the only one here asking the questions I'd like answered, but I didn't see anyone making an effort to try to give an informed answer. From the perspective of miners, the halving is a big blow, many won't be able to mine at a profit and will shut down. This is a fact. Why are people just ignoring this? Are we really just *hoping* for the hash rate to stay the same?
We know for a fact that many miners work on slim margins, and hashing power has already moved to states and countries where electricity is the cheapest. Their income will be cut in half. If people in this subreddit found that their salary is cut in half one day, would they continue working for at the same company? No, they would quit. I don't understand the optimism of the subreddit regarding the halving.
Many seem to think that mining is as simple as buying an ASIC, plugging it in and watch as the money flows in. In reality mining is very concentrated and done by big farms with huge energy needs so it's more like operating a factory. It needs constant attention by a qualified person, taxes need to be paid, maybe even the rent for the place, and the electricity bill is in the $100,000 range per year.
Mining is a big part of the bitcoin system, and many miners are about to quit. Why do we celebrate? I'm seriously just wtf'ing when I read all the self congratulatory threads.

It feels like we're speaking different languages. For you "investing" means that you buy bitcoin and you keep those bitcoins for years no matter what. I don't get that. Who forces you to keep your money in bitcoin? Who stops you from converting to another atlcoin? I just understand what is stopping you.
With fiat currency when I exchange currencies, I have to physically go to an exchange, the office has to be open and I have to travel a certain distance, so there's some limiting factor. With cryptocurrencies you can transfer your money from bitcoin to ripple in under a minute from the comfort of your home 24/7. WHERE'S THE LOCK-IN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT? You talking like once you "invested" in bitcoin, that's it, there's nothing you can do to move your money to litecoin. THAT is what I don't get.

What I don't understand, how are they planning to achieve mass adoption? The price of their device is huge, and the passive mining will inflate the electricity bills of their users (by a small amount). The mining hardware tends to get obsolete at a fast rate too, so they need users to purchase new hardware every few years. Again, how will they convince people to do that?

I'm not a financial expert by any means, but the way I see it what we have today is much worse. Back then paper money was backed by gold, so people expected that their money was available at all times.
Today we **know** that money is mostly digital, not backed by anything, there's no way to cash everything out and consumers have no saying in how it's created.
We need $2 trillion to wage a useless war? Sure, no problem, let me enter some numbers into a computer, and bam, trillions are created. Who will pay for it? Today nobody, we tacked it on a bill for the future, no worries.

I agree with you, but the average phone is already doing many things that people wouldn't like if they knew about it. You're underestimating the ignorance of the general public. They know basically nothing about the technical details of their own phones.
Some people calculated the cost of the extra electricity used by the mining chip and it came in at around $40 per year, which is negligible for most people if they get a valuable service for it. For me the question still is whether their digital marketplace will live up to the hype or not. We know nothing of it yet, only that it's been hyped to the moon and back.

The hardware has indeed gone much more energy efficient. In the same time software has gone into massive resource drain mode. Programmers are getting lazier and generally speaking they understand less and less of the entire software stack so they pile on layers upon layers of abstraction which lead to a lot of overhead.
The advantage of the many abstraction layers is that developers can provide many features and fast release cycles and that's what users care about and that's what sells phones. Consider that 15 years ago Netscape Navigator was regarded as extremely bloated, but compared to today's Firefox it's like comparing Paint to Photoshop. Just the browser itself is almost like a complete OS in itself with its own network stack and graphic subsystem.
