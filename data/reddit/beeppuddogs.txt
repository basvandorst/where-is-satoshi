Thanks. I thought I had my first useful post of the year and that guy started hating on me.

Not very romantic. Sometimes you gotta just suck it up and give your girl what she wants... but I hope it works out for you.

Coinbase user since 2014. Never had an issue with the services, but the shit they pulled recently does not align with my views on bitcoin. I think coinbase has done a lot of good in terms of opening the door to Americans but are starting to be conducive to an unhealthy economical environment.

How does "Shorting" work. Is their a variable amount of $$$ you can cash out depending on how low it goes? 
Is there any sense in long term holders shorting bitcoin as a way to minimize risk?

I like this :). Gonna go check out your site. I deal mainly in doge and bitcoins. Doge makes me feel better when bitcoins make me feel bad.

How funny. I pulled out ALL of my investments from scottrade 4 months ago and invested in bitcoin and now dogecoin. Down about 15% overall so far but have ZERO regrets. I believe in cryptos and I am in it for the long haul. You should have seen the guy when he asked what I was doing with the money.

Probably will be in Grant County. Super cheap electricity and land. It does get hot in the summer, but winter will be nice and cool.

Nice video dude! Maybe use a file or something and vice it down so that you have a perfectly straight guide line for imprinting your numbers/letters.

How do I access my bcash from bread wallet? And if I do, does it compromise the security of my btc wallet?
@_date: 2019-06-21 05:16:00
Thats nothing compared to the walls that were going down during the rally to 20k.
@_date: 2019-06-19 23:39:09
Is there a site that has compiled all of the other sites where you can buy things with btc? I specifically am looking to buy a pair of binoculars.

good job!

He said "a month ago". 
 
One month ago we were roughly at the same price as today.

If this small variance is too much to handle over the course of one month then I agree. It would be better to go back to your previous en devours.

My wife told me when we were at sub 6k that it was going to be ok. 
She said it was going to "Go back up a little" Then "Back down a little" and keep doing that until it "Goes back up a lot'.
I think she knows more than goji stars.

Yup. Had a coinbase auto buy set up for years. Best investment ever.
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:20:24
Bought more @ 10.2
Saw a reverse triangle pattern forming in the cloud..... Obvious bear den.
@_date: 2018-02-16 06:26:01
You gonna tell us what you bought or what?
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:49:46
What are you speaking of? 
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:23:15
Yesterday was like the 3rd highest volume of all time... So lower volume today is no surprise. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:08:37
You are wasting your time asking rhetorical questions.

Overstock's stock (OSTK) went up about 5% after the bitcoin news hit mainstream. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 06:11:46
Coinbase has accepted my 2 bitcoin purchases for 890 each.... And canceled my 2 sub 700$ purchases. So frustrating. I hope that you have a better experience with them!
