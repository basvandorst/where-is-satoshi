It's really not that difficult, people... and DISCLAIMER: I DON'T work for Genesis, I'm just sick of bullshit arguments and need to vent somehow. 
So, in very simplified terms:
 
---------- SIMPLE CALCULATION ----------
You purchase hashing power from Genesis. That money CANNOT be recovered directly from Genesis by e.g. selling the hashing power.
 
* Variable X:
Your purchased hashing power will mine X Bitcoin per day. This number can go up and down based on various factors... mostly it'll go down because of difficulty.
 
* Variable Y:
They will deduct Y Bitcoin from your daily payout as a maintenance fee. Y fluctuates with the price of bitcoin, as it is based on a fixed amount of $0.00028 per GH per day.
 
* Variable Z:
Your daily net gain (in Bitcoin, NOT DOLLARS!) is Z = X - Y
 
Let's say you spend a nice round number...  $5k ($4940) to buy 38,000 GH/s. 
* X: CURRENTLY, X is about 0.011 Bitcoin
* Y: CURRENTLY, Y is about 0.004 Bitcoin
* Z: You have a daily net gain of Z = X - Y =  0.007 Bitcoin. Yay!
 
If the value of Bitcoin goes up, Y goes down, so your net gain Z is more (as is the amount of $ you get for selling Z)
When the difficulty goes up, X goes down, so your net gain Z is less (and might become negative).
 
("CURRENTLY" meaning a rough estimate of what's going on right about now (first week of August 2017) - those numbers are not accurate, just a guide!)
 
---------- ROI EXAMPLE ----------
If you sell today's Z or 0.007, it'll make you about 19 Bucks. To regain your initial "investment" of $4940 (i.e. reach ROI) you will need to be able to make $19 every day for 260 days, or hodl and hope you accumulate Bitcoin worth $4940 or more before Z becomes negative.
 
You're HOPING that Z remains positive for long enough to make back your initial "investment" of $5000, and more.
You're RISKING that that's not going to happen because:
a) Z may become negative too early
b) Genesis may go out of business 
c) The arse falls out of the whole cryptocurrency-thing
d) Your momma takes away your computer privileges
e) Iceland gets buried in a mile of ash from one of their volcanos
f) Some other crap that could happen, WTF are you asking me for, I'm just making sht up at this point!
 
---------- WHY WOULD SOMEONE SELL HASHING POWER RATHER THAN JUST MINE LIKE MOFOs??? ----------
Why would any company sell shares in their business? To spread the risk, to raise money, to grow, etc. Same principle really, not a scam just based on that single fact... at least no more of a scam than the stock market.
And Y is part of their income: they're betting that the sum of Y deducted from all of their customers is higher than the cost to run the company.
 
---------- WHY WOULDN'T I JUST BUY BITCOIN??? ----------
You can. $5000 will get you roughly 1.85 Bitcoin now. Mining with $5000 worth of hashing power will give you an amount of Bitcoin over time, based on Z. Is that going to be more or less than 1.85 by the time Z goes negative? ... that's basically the risk/gamble you're taking. 
 
To put it really simply:
- buying bitcoin: you're betting on price
- mining: you're betting on the relationship between difficulty and price
 
---------- WHY WOULDN'T YOU JUST SPEND THE $5000 ON A MINING RIG??? ----------
Can you set up a 38TH rig for $5000 - TODAY? (e.g. the Antminer S9 will ship by mid to end October, just FYI - that's a good 3 months worth of mining)
Can you guarantee that your Y is lower than that of Genesis? (Because there's still going to be a "Y": the cost of electricity, downtime, spare parts, time to maintain the whole thing, your girlfriend being mad at you, etc.)
Are you willing to spend the time and effort?
Yes, yes, and hellsyes? Then by all means - go for it!
 
Hope this helps at least one person... writing it helped me deal with my frustration... I should get free hashing power from Genesis for this... :)
