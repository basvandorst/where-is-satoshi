healthcare should cost more if you smoke or if your older.   both are higher risk for problems.   what you suggest is that young people who are perfectly healthy should pay for some moron smoking causing all kinds of health problems

free?   you clearly dont have a clue how things work... in those countries the government takes a massive about of money from your paycheck to pay for your "free" healthcare.

Homeless people can still receive free care in America.   Babies are always on there parents plans.. have you ever seen a baby paying bills ?  Lol.  Please just stop

best part of american healthcare you can both be seen right away no need to wait.   and if you cant afford healthcare the government and hospitals have many programs to pick up the tab.

that's not free though.   basically you just described health insurance.   I pay 160 a month for my family plan.   I've had some bad years with alot of time spent at doctors and some years i didnt go once.   It still cost me 160 a month...

you maybe but many people dont like paying more money only to wait months to see a doctor.   Id rather pay less and see a doctor the same day i get sick

Canadians pay 42 percent to the government each paycheck.   42 freaking percent.   thats double anywhere in America.   there's no such thing a free healthcare.   you pay for it one way or another.   California just tried to other "free healthcare" but found out it was going to double the state budget.  free healthcare was going to cost them 600 billion dollars a year..

wtf is my problem .... "you fucking moron"  you should look in a mirror

Bullshit in America I get care the same day no matter what.  Cost me next to nothing.   When I lived in Canada I had to wait a long time for less serious stuff.  But I had money and it seemed serious to me.
