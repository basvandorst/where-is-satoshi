I guess the message is to participate in crypto economy by interacting with people and forming a community.

Another perspective is that using/transacting it can help us better understand the economy and impact of the crypto.  Also it gets us to learn about its philosophy. By interacting with another user through the practice we can form a community - that’s what popularize crypto as a currency on another level. Buying and hodling, for most people who just wanna make a quick profit, do not educate them much on the why it’s better to generate different random addresses and etc.
