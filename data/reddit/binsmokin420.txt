LOL.   Im currently using windows.  I didn't realize that exchanges are not wallets per say.  Wow.  thanks.  Where should i send it?  I have a blockchain wallet that auto logs in because windows remembers my password but i forget my memonic phrase or whatever and probably my pin lol.  I should open a new wallet.

I honestly think someone is going to come up with a coin that is better altogether, like a bitcoin 2.0  If someone can improve everything that people don't like about bitcoin (like the huge transaction fees) they just might take it over.  I believe in the future of crypto, I just think bitcoin has it's flaws.
@_date: 2018-08-13 19:48:41
Ok then
@_date: 2018-08-22 07:52:48
these people are NOT going to take 9 coins from their own pocket and reimburse this guy
@_date: 2018-08-22 07:50:05
Have you gotten any progress with this yet dude?  I'd love to see you get your coins back. I don't understand where they will come from though, like me, doesn't the person who scammed you have them now?  If that's the case, I don't see LBC taking the loss on 9 bitcoins because this guy did this too you and the govn hates bitcoin so much I don't think you will get any help there either.  The police force sure isn't going to waste their time on this investigation.  The bank has a fraud department for this and they have made their decision already. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 14:09:46
I had the same thing happen to me from LBC I sold a bitcoin for 1200$ and then released the funds to the buyer, the next day they did a charge back.  When I brought this to the attention of my bank, they too froze my account to 'launch an investigation'  When they found out it was bitcoin related they told me i was shit out of luck because they dont deal with bitcoin in any way shape or form.  I didn't even think to take it further than that.  I wish I had.  I wonder if anyone that has been scammed like this HAS got their funds back.  I traced the ip the guy was using to communticate with me and it showed up as in new york.  He might of been using a vpn though, and that information didn't help me much.  I hate the fact that the bank allows these 'charge backs' to even happen.  I had walls of emal communication to prove that I wasn't making it up.  They also locked my account and prevented me from ever sending e transfers ever again too.  I had to switch banks.  I took my loss.  With 9  bitcoins I might of taken a lot more action, but this is sickening and I cant believe LBC allows this crap to happen.  I don't even know what they could do about it really.  It's in the banks hands now.  It's THEIR decision to approve a charge back or not.  Not LBC

I didn't predict anything, that was my whole point.  I said by this time next year it could be worthless or it could reach record setting highs changing the world.  No different than saying it might rain in the next month or it might not. That's NOT a prediction, that's just reality.  Look up the word prediction before you open your flap or learn to read and comprehend the English language.
@_date: 2018-08-21 14:16:19
Banks wont help us in any of these matters because of their despise for bitcoins in general
@_date: 2018-08-22 07:52:14
same decision as in my case too.  They take the side of the guy NOT selling a bitcoin because they want nothing to do with it, are threatened by it, and don't want to go out of there way to 'help' you retrieve these when they don't even want us using them.
@_date: 2018-08-14 02:17:14
LOL when you wake up to a stupid comment like that I guess you can say, I was grumpy.  Sorry mate.  I'm not even replying to the folks that disbelieve i was early adopter.  Sigh,  I COULD prove it I GUESS but it's not the worth the time entertaining these guys.  What's the point?  I was well into bitcoin (had over 10 at one point before the crazy and before the original silk road went down,Ross went to jail,and bitcoin crashed to 49$  I sold a bunch at 455 and the rest a little over 1000, shortly BEFORE it hit record highs in Dec, ooops  no regrets, I don't care.  I never investing anything I couldn't afford to lose anyway
@_date: 2018-08-13 03:40:40
Long time redditor here: The crypto boat is sinking! Jump while you still can.  Forget about the woman and children!!!!  I'm just here for the shitshow.  Everyone enjoys a good train-wreck.  I also find it hysterical how many people make predictions on what's going to happen.  "look at the charts, we are heading for another bla bla bla", you people might as well throw out these charts because NOBODY knows where crypto will be in 12 months from now.  It could be dead, it could change the world.  Anyone who says they know is purely speculating.
@_date: 2018-08-21 14:14:52
Like kijjiji now, I can't sell a thing on it anymore without filtering out all the scammers that contact me with a newish kijjiji scam
@_date: 2017-02-24 03:40:43
I was just going by the news articles I've read and the multiple mention of it on reddit.  He bought 2 pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins back in 2010 apparently.  Is that story fabricated?
@_date: 2017-02-24 03:41:52
That article from forbes was written dec 2013 valuing them at 7 million
@_date: 2017-02-24 04:02:49
I was wondering the same thing.
@_date: 2017-02-24 15:25:14
Damn, it is as bad as I thought.  He probably got out of the game.
@_date: 2017-02-24 03:33:44
To clarify, I don't want the persons name, I'm just wondering if he/she is still in the community 
@_date: 2017-02-24 03:39:34
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:02:10
aaaah, yeah I thought you were serious, sorry
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:49:53
There is no such thing.  Hash PLANT seeds, maybe
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:50:35
Yeah, I don't see a lot of people jumping on board NOW if they haven't already.  Jees
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:48:48
Yeah, this time last year everyone (including myself) was talking about bitcoin like it was a great investment and it was gonna take over the world.  Now everyone is talking about how BAD an bitcoin is doing and how much money people have lost.  Not a lot of people are hyping it up these days.  It's got fear all over it.  This is not good for bitcoin.  It might survive, I don't know, but it doesn't have a good image these days.  It's still too complicated for the average consumer too, I can't picture my parents ever getting involved in bitcoin.  I honestly think it was a fad.  Fads die.
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:19:03
I think I understood most of that.  Thanks for breaking it down for me.  Kind of makes sense now.  When there is a ton of people trying to sell and don't care about the price, they are willing to go on the cheap, driving the price down.  It's kinda like an auction going backwards.
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:22:07
I've said the exact same things many times over.  Anyone who tells you that they know where bitcoin is gonna go is either a fortune teller or a liar.  Check my history.  And yes, I was in bitcoin a long time before the silk road ever went down in 2013.  I had to be.  I was buying drugs online for me and my friends.  Don't care who knows it either.  Drugs are LONG gone now.  Up in smoke.
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:59:58
I've been with bitcoin for years and I still don't understand how people can sell without other people buying.  I would think that for every 100 bitcoins people panic sell, there is 100 bitcoins being 'bought' by other people, balancing it out.  I know nothing. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:31:45
well said.  
@_date: 2018-03-11 23:58:03
Ya they can kill bitcoin.  And they will.  
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:51:25
LOL it's 'on sale' right now
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:53:03
LOL.  HIS OWN.
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:32:25
Late December last year.
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:56:50
No, I've been with bitcoin before the big bust of the silk road and it bottomed out to 49$ after in 2013.  It was all uphill since then.  Glad I got out.  I still have a tiny amount, but I don't think it will recover from this.  I think it's going to be the main source of currency for the black market, and that's it.  Without it being mainstream anymore, I predict a bottom of $1000 and I believe it will stay there for a while.  It will stabilize as no more people are interested in investing other than drug buyers and sellers.  It'll never see 10k again, it really was just a fad.
@_date: 2018-11-25 02:10:31
Honestly don't remember.  Doesn't matter anyway.  We didn't buy bitcoin to sit on them, and we didn't care what they were worth.  It always varied.  We bought them with fiat, got our drugs, had a good time.  No regrets.  I STILL do it.  Again, look at my comment history.
@_date: 2018-02-26 17:15:43
hmmm says it's already completed
@_date: 2018-02-27 13:52:57
it all happened way quicker than I thought it would.  I had my BTC from Binance within about an hour, then when I sent it to the online vendor, he had 6 confirmations in 30 min.  Did Lightning network kick in or something?  Or is the traffic and que's for mining just low atm?
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:47:12
that's good advice. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 16:00:46
I'm not sure i could withdraw directly from binance to the vendor.  Wish i had known.  I figured out the address problem, don't know how.  I created a new blockchain wallet i.d. and put a request for a withdraw on binance to that address.  It's pending.  I've heard these things can take a while?  (not transfers, but withdraws)
@_date: 2018-11-22 14:22:33
They can take that coin and turn it into fiat immediately.  Nobody told them they have to hodl for months.  What are you talking about?  It's a perfect way for them to receive money without a paper trail.  If I was a vendor NOW, I would hodl because I think bitcoin is gonna bounce back a bit
@_date: 2018-02-26 17:15:01
i did need one, and i went through with it.  I heard withdrawls can take days from binance though.  we will see.
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:57:54
explains the fast confirmations.  The transaction fees were surprising low, even with a priority tip for the miners.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:57:10
If i sell all my bitcoin and buy, tron coin with all of it hoping tron doubles in the next few days would that be considered panic selling?  Or would trading one crypto for another in a gamble still be considered 'holding'
@_date: 2018-07-31 11:54:09
There is also a couple agents spending time for 'skimming' bitcoins for themselves during the whole process 
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:45:48
I wasn't.  I was poking fun at the this theory that was floating around a couple weeks ago.
@_date: 2018-04-14 04:46:02
Shit like this?
@_date: 2018-04-02 12:07:50
I like your analogy.  I really shouldn't buy this $700 cellphone, but  I already have 6 others so it's not like it's costing me anything if I lose it.  It wont feel like losing $700 with 6 other cellphones at home will it?  Yes, yes it will.   Losing that new cellphone is EXACTLY like spending $700 and losing all of it.
@_date: 2016-05-05 07:06:54
