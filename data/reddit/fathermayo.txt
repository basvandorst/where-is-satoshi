Hilarious. And all the people who lost their money can't wait to put money in the next alt coin scam. They'll never learn. 
@_date: 2014-12-31 06:28:46
Apparently you are not allowed to say this. 
@_date: 2014-12-31 06:26:57
And this is also upvoted 8 times?
I really have to explain to you why at the end of a year people look back at the last 12 months and not 14 months?
Sorry, i refuse to. 
@_date: 2014-12-30 13:26:36
I never knew Google also indicated if the searches or positive or negative. Amazing.  
@_date: 2014-12-30 20:39:45
People still fall for these mining scams? Hard to believe. 
@_date: 2014-12-30 23:36:11
Because looking back at the previous year makes more sense than looking back 14 months. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 11:45:27
This guy has been doing this for months and months already. 2 days after the news breaks he reposts it again. People have been telling him to stop doing it but he just ignores it. Something is seriously wrong with that guy.

You know, when you don't include any numbers then nobody has a clue what we're looking at. That chart could be about 3 cents or 5 dollars.
@_date: 2015-01-01 17:52:10
Did you not see 2 others already posted it minutes ago?
It's always the same when these phishing mails go out. 100 people a day post about it all thinking they are the first to post it. 
And when you people get over the fact that phishing mails exist? I stopped worrying and posting about them 15 years ago. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 19:01:43
Arguments for what?
@_date: 2015-01-01 22:38:06
Well, if analysts say so then it must be true. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 20:40:20
Because he's not being serious. 
I am. And that's only allowed if you say something the cult wants to hear. Anything else and you get downvoted to oblivion. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 12:50:04
You found 2 charts that went down. Amazing. What are the odds. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 06:52:29
You have some serious issues. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 20:59:42
Wtf? 
@_date: 2015-01-02 15:25:40
Every day Bitcoin doesn't go up many here are looking for someone to blame. It will get even worse if Bitcoin goes lower. 
These people expected to be rich from their 2 coins by now so they're getting really frustrated. 
They're also getting more paranoid. Everything lately is a conspiracy by paid shills, governments and banks. I really hope the price will go up soon so these crazies will shut up again. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 21:22:13
Just because traditional finance isn't doing good doesn't mean Bitcoin will go up. 
I realize that the general thought in this sub is that if fiat does bad everyone will automatically move to Bitcoin as the only possible option but the rest of the world outside of this sub don't seem to agree with that. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 23:48:41
Where exactly?
@_date: 2015-01-01 20:30:06
I see this place reached a new low. Downvoted for having a personal opinion in a thread about personal opinions. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 07:13:30
This is based on what exactly? Other than you investing in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-01-01 17:33:15
Amazing logic. Who needs proof or reason when you just know it's true because you said so.

Ath stands for all time high. Which is 1200 something. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 20:58:23
As a new account i have to be careful when being critical? Last time i checked we're not in China or North Korea. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 18:42:59
You fit perfectly in this sub. 
You people are hilarious. Always trying to censor and limit other people you don't like or agree with. Do you see the irony?
@_date: 2015-01-02 13:55:59
Affect. It's affect. Why is such a simple word so difficult for half the population. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 13:18:40
It's not almost mainstream. Far from. Stop fooling yourself. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 19:00:46
What's the problem? You don't want people here who don't agree with you? 
@_date: 2015-01-01 19:52:35
I think 150-170. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 21:48:01
I had several downvotes before it got upvoted. 
Edit: is there any reason this comment should be downvoted?
@_date: 2015-01-02 07:02:31
That's funny. Because posts about banking errors, credit card theft and Paypal fees get posted all day and upvoted to the top. 
Oh wait, that is of course "good for Bitcoin" so then that rule can be broken. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 19:16:18
Are you by any chance invested in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-01-02 11:35:11
Then the post i replied to doesn't make much sense. Does it?
@_date: 2015-01-01 17:45:30
Yes. Everyone who is critical of Bitcoin represents the government or banks. No other option. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 18:16:49
TIL asking for evidence is trolling.  
@_date: 2015-01-01 18:46:08
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
@_date: 2015-01-02 12:09:16
You fell for a scam pump and dump coin because you thought you were gonna get rich quick. You saw the warning signs as it looked too good to be true and ignored people's advise to stay away from them but did it anyway. Am i close?
@_date: 2015-01-02 07:56:18
You won't. Neither will you admit how wrong and ridiculous your prediction was by then. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 17:34:13
And this is somehow a fact?
@_date: 2015-01-01 23:37:47
I see you're totally completely super offended. Please tell me where i said anything about being equal?? I have no idea where you even got that from. Try reading better. 
Obviously all i was aiming at is that both China and North Korea aren't exactly known for their free speech on the internet. Is that really that totally fucking absurd and offending?
