I don't like to upvote stuff like this but this is too damn funny.

Not strictly a contradiction.  Sure, in terms of demand for bitcoin, the government's acceptance and subsequent conversion cancels itself out.  But it can also indirectly stimulate demand for bitcoin in a lot of ways.  Perceived legitimacy is one, and the third party contracts also divert money from the credit card sector into whatever conversion companies get the bid.  As the government realizes the cost savings (the stated objective in the first place) it's more likely this kind of thing can spread.
Right now people are forced to convert their bitcoin into fiat if the want to pay taxes: a disincentive to use.  Even if the government immediately converts out of crypto, they've made it easier for citizens to participate in the crypto economy.

Make a list of all your old email accounts and go through your old email messages.  See if any bitcoin website contacted you in those emails.  If you can figure out what website you purchased the bitcoin on, they might be around and still in business.  If it was mt gox, you're out of luck, but otherwise see if you can log in or go through their password recovery process.  They might make you jump through some hoops to prove your identity.

I like Falkvinge.
But I don't buy some parts of this.  He says trying to seize land with tanks would eventually be like pointing a gun at someone and telling them to change the meaning of a word.  Which of course the can't, because at least 51% of the population already agrees on the meaning.  But in blockchain world, one person can change the meaning of a word if they have the private key for that word.  So you could still steal someone's land with tanks and guns by scaring them into signing the deed over to you.  Or you could steal their bitcoins by getting them to tell you where their private keys are.
Or is this not the kind of theft that Falkvinge is talking about?  What sort of land theft could blockchain prevent?

How does the author calculate that the market for store of value is 8 trillion dollars?
Edit:  Very cool site, by the way! :)
Edit again: OK, I see he's figuring that since there's about 8 trillion worth of gold in the world, this means there's a demand of 8 trillion for the market for store of value.  Now I'm wondering if that's valid.

Couldn't this have been done with changetip instead of people posting their public addresses?

How are you able to offer such a substantial discount when other merchants in this thread indicated that it's not feasible to them? Are you doing this at a loss?
