How long will it take for fees to come down? Until we clear mempool?

Its just a good ol stampede again like has happened so many times in BTC. Probably lots of the new money, which is usually flighty because they don't even know what they just bought. A little scare and the new money heard runs for the exits. Could be the 2 devs that shot down SegWit activation in 2 months, who knows but something scared the herd. I will do nothing and just watch the circus go on by.

Good point. But still what if one just wanted to buy out of their bank acct and takke advantage of the low price? I tried to set up acct with GDAX but not available in my state

I am done with Coinbase they have cost me way too much money today. I was in perfect position to catch a bounce and Coinbase froze/choked. They always choke at the percise moment you are about to get a win

No noob trader here, Im confused about a good option to trade USD. I have a Bitfinex aact but not sure how to raise my verifications, there must be limits with them right? Also no GDAX available in my state.

Thanks! Yeah got all the vefication into Gemini but bc of hiigh volume looking at 2 weeks :( Thats the way it is right now though, crypto gold rush. I'm an old school guy, paper wallets for cold storage for years now. Went to finally pick up  a hardware wallet and everywhere is on backorder! Sheesh, kinda liked this space before the heard showed up, lol.
