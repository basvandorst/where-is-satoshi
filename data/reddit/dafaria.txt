I have a disease, and they don't know what to call it.

I have no idea what I'm doing either. Kinda just in Bitcoin for fun, but still obviously don't want to lose all my BTC!
I've read there's a chance there will be 2 Chainz, and from what I've read, if I have the right wallet I can choose which blockchain I want to follow?
I'm currently using Exodus. Would you be able to give me some quick layman's instructions on the best thing to do? Lmao

Very true...! :P

Alright, I'm 'network synchronising' in Bitcoin Core, hopefully that'll be done by the time I wake up tomorrow lmao.
Then I'll have a look to see which I prefer.
Thanks again :) -D

Thanks! Also, according to Exodus, I have access to the keys (and I do) and they're only stored on my device. But is there any MAJOR difference between wallets? Core/Electrum/Airbitz/CoPay/etc?

Sorry, noob here. Do I want to "switch nodes to BTC1" (I have no idea what that means by the way"? I've been advised to use a wallet such as Bitcoin Core as it's a lot safer than my current one. But I'm getting a warning message about unknown blocks being mixed. So what do I do?
*Edit: I think I solved it myself, downloaded it from bitcoinuasf.org. Although my stupid anti-virus keeps telling me bitcoinqt.exe, and it kept deleting the file, lmao, fkn annoying thing*

I'm a Bitcoin miner, but I'm also a newbie.
What can I do to help?
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:50:15
I'm calling ~$2400-~$2600

I'm an absolute newbie to BTC (my father was going to buy 600 bitcoins when it first came out and decided not to... wtf dad), and all my currencies (Ethereum/BTC/Dash/etc) are in the Exodus wallet. I have access to the private keys but I'm not sure about my control over them.
I don't want to necessarily take the "safe route" (temporary exchange to Ethereum or something along those lines), but I don't want to do something stupid and risky. I *do* want to learn, but don't know if I can learn enough before August 1st.
I've seen people saying they will buy BIP148 BTC; is it possible these lose all value completely? If so, what are the chances of that happening? Where can I buy BIP148?
Also, have I got it correct that:
The only thing being separated is the actual blockchain (the route bitcoins take), and not the actual currency? And once your make a transaction along one of these chains, you can't go back?
Edit: Also, if I have a bitcoin wallet with 1 non-UASF BTC in it, is it possible to receive 0.0001 UASF BTC, and if so, what are the consequences of this?

I've only got ~0.2 BTC and ~0.4 ETH, but there's no way in hell I'm dropping out. Even in regular stocks the dip is when you buy, not sell.
