So how is r/illegallifeprotips okay?
@_date: 2018-09-21 23:21:28
Nice, will follow this.
@_date: 2018-08-10 10:50:06
That will never happen. The lower it goes the more miners drop out easing competition on the rest. The break even point for many large miners is net $0 since they pre-pay for infrastructure &amp; energy.

Not to mention property, about $75-$125 trillion.

Glad for you. LBC are the worst. Lost several to a hack whilst my coins were briefly online. Their support team is so f*cking rude. 
@_date: 2017-02-22 02:36:15
Yea, shame because his BTC &amp; silver predictions are v insightful. But the ANTARCTICA, chemtrails, the sun is a mirror comments, etc, his fringe level went way up.
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:28:24
I have done. I had a few things to secure &amp; lockdown first. Hope it can somehow be beneficial to others.
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:31:30
No idea yet, good sir :(
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:32:44
Yea you guys are right. I guess the only satisfaction I can feel is that whoever got em suffered a hefty 10% price drop. Karma? Who knows.
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:29:48
Deets below ma man!!!
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:29:07
They are very interesting. Please, take a read.
@_date: 2017-03-19 05:47:33
Thanks for the good input. I certainly will be doing this. Was on my mind to do so before this event, but unfortunately I didn't invest before it was too late.
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:26:35
Thanks guys. I know that I've gotta buck it up, I'm not looking for sympathy. But it was a long hard slog to get those BTCs. I just needed a vent. 
For those asking, I do want to make this clear, that I am not security amateur, although, I am no expert, I take more than reasonable precautions. &amp; no, I didn't leave my coins on an online wallet or exchange ^^
But that is what I am still trying to figure out. I am speaking with the wallet developers (which, at this moment I will not say), &amp; we are trying to get to the bottom of this. 
So basically, I downloaded a new wallet a few days ago,  &amp; moved my stash there. Within two (Thursday night), my funds had been entirety (save for sub transaction amounts) cleaned out, &amp; sent to unknown addresses.
I stored the pass &amp; other info in two places. One on a word document.. that was encrypted, with multiple password protections (in several folders) &amp; on an external drive. So the only plausible way this could have been compromised is during the brief minutes that it was connected.
The other was in my email. Which is also moderately encrypted, has a different password from both wallet &amp; document, &amp; has 2FA. No unrecognized IPs or logins.
Computer did find a PUP on a scan, which was a toolbar search on Google Chrome (which I do not use. I have Firefox, so this seems unrelated, though I'm not discounting it).
So. Any ideas, fellas?
(Oh, &amp; I use Windows OS, with the *standard* account).
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:27:36
No, not yet. Hoping some Reddit hack might.
@_date: 2018-10-19 22:38:14
KoreanJew? 
@_date: 2019-08-09 15:35:17
How much leverage did you use?
@_date: 2019-08-07 20:17:05
Can you be more specific? How much leverage did you use? Futures / perpetual? Stop loss? Etc.
@_date: 2019-06-21 22:06:43
You still think Libertarianism is possible/worth pursuing?
@_date: 2019-02-12 18:46:45
Lmao. Whatever stances you are referring to are less than meaningless. Private business owners do not have the right to refuse service to anyone. Try not baking a cake based on your beliefs &amp; see the lawsuits roll in.
@_date: 2019-02-12 14:02:23
So if he bans Blacks &amp; Jews you will be cool with that huh? Damn, sucks you don't support the Civil Rights Act.
@_date: 2019-02-12 18:43:06
What are you talking about? Did you hit your head on concrete? But go ahead, don't let anyone stop you from vouching for discrimination.
@_date: 2019-02-16 01:19:14
Lmao. Don't forget McAfee said $1M was extremely conservative &amp; actually expected $3-4M. 
@_date: 2019-02-12 13:46:24
Lmao. "Start your own social media." Oh yea, we did that with Gab &amp; it got shadow banned &amp; deplatformed from financial processors.
@_date: 2019-02-12 18:49:57
That is an embarrassing position to take - uou are justifying banning people for their beliefs? Presumably you would also be fine with "No Blacks or Chinks" signs at a restaurant too huh? 
@_date: 2017-04-16 16:59:56
Any publicity..? 
@_date: 2018-04-04 21:29:27
Really? What is your expectation? 
@_date: 2018-04-04 23:56:03
I have a sell order at $1M. Let's see where it goes first.
@_date: 2018-04-09 13:04:12
If they are lucky. Have seen many in Europe at 40% when they are the first around a new area.
@_date: 2018-04-04 21:39:46
Really? What is your expectation? 
@_date: 2017-05-22 18:42:44
I know, how great is it :D
@_date: 2018-04-04 21:59:18
That is quite specific. But you've obviously witnessed enough to know where to pin it. 
Have you been involved throughout that entire time, or just off &amp; on? 
@_date: 2018-04-04 21:40:13
Really? Why do you expect so? 
@_date: 2018-04-04 21:33:53
Interesting, thanks.
@_date: 2018-04-04 22:15:45
That's an interesting take, thanks. How long have you been involved in BTC?
@_date: 2016-05-29 01:28:33
@_date: 2016-05-28 21:19:12
Bravo :) You'll save a lot of regular coin espesh considering the new cig rules.
@_date: 2016-05-28 20:53:40
Same, 40 bucks in a few hours is unsustainable. I'm preparing to buy when it nosedives enough.
@_date: 2016-05-28 21:01:04
Sucks bro! :( I'm using it for long term now. I don't know many places where I can actually use it to but stuff in UK.
Had 0.2 before and the rest today. 
It was either put money on this or the EU ref. I think this is less volatile then the votes outcome!
@_date: 2016-05-29 14:47:21
I was about to ask for the seller.. before I saw the date :(((
Points to you to get in on it early though. I heard about it probably mid-2013 but didn't get involved.
My bad. Still, I bought a month ago so that's a good $75 rise per coin.
@_date: 2016-05-28 20:34:08
@_date: 2016-05-28 21:30:15
I know, I hate that 3 ID ver. Only individual sellers mind, not site rules. I bought today with a day old account and no ID requests.
@_date: 2016-05-29 20:05:33
We'll top that mate.
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:28:12
Daym this Bitcoin has a lot of lives. 
@_date: 2016-05-28 21:05:19
Actually I'm only a few weeks in so getting my bearings. I get a lot of my knowledge from you vets.
Is this all down to Chn as everyone saying?
@_date: 2016-05-29 01:26:42
Why plunge?
@_date: 2016-05-29 01:37:05
Keynes v Hayek? :)))
@_date: 2016-05-28 21:23:53
'Local Bit Coins' pretty good, but just search for sites that specifically take Euros. 
And only 8? I think most vendors will have a higher minimum than that.
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:42:52
Dude, respectfully, get the hell away from Exodus. They're website wallet download link was compromised in March. Some people got completely cleaned out. Use at your own risk is my advice.
@_date: 2016-05-28 20:52:20
Same. £352 now. I only got one though.
@_date: 2018-12-10 02:33:58
Could you also place a long at that target? 
@_date: 2018-12-10 02:32:38
Would it be possible to long with this models target?
