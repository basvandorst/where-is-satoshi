I think that's always a good approach until you’ve acquired enough research on a matter and have had time to analyze everything.


In the sense that he (via MS) helped to thwart competition, a lot of innovation and small business survival in the world of computers.
It's not to say everything Bill has done is bad, it's just that it would appear after doing research, that more harm than good has been done overall (especially when it comes to charity).
There's certainly an argument to be made that Microsoft's approach made computers more affordable to lower waged people by having an OS that can run ubiquitously on cheaply-made hardware by various vendors.  But I guess the multi-trillion-dollar question is would there have been even cheaper alternatives if it wasn't for Microsoft's blatant anti-competitive and monopolistic business practices that went along with it.
I think when you add up all the history, facts and research it becomes clear that MS hurt the computer industry and most certainly hurt innovation especially when you consider they had a horrible habit of buying up competitive technologies and mothballing them and/or pressuring companies not to innovate or use other technologies.
Overall, I think charity should be be commended, but also think people should weigh the good with the bad.  Bill Gates is no Robin Hood in my eyes; Far from it, unfortunately.

People like... Bill Gates?  He must thank jeebus every day for people that don't look at the big picture and don't know his history.  Despite his charity it's been a huge net loss for charity and society overall.

You may have to scroll up to read it.  I understand why people think Bill Gates is this fantastic guy, but it's a shame they base that opinion without all the facts.
