I had this conversation with someone when bitcoin was around 3-4K. I could not get him to understand that it was still early. At around the same time I talked another guy into buying at 4800. I'm that guy's hero now. What was funny was that was near the top in Sept. A week or two later bitcoin went down to 3000. What did my buddy do? Bought more at 3600. My man.

I've been through so many that I just view them as normal cycles and I just hodl patiently. I no longer care about the current value of bitcoin. All I care about it the future value that I'm expecting based on my own calculations. I have a number in mind, and I won't move a single satoshi until I can buy something of that value with one bitcoin. And I'll buy everything *with* bitcoin. I'm never going to sell bitcoin for dollars. I will no longer be down with that archaic form of money.

You kinda need that amount of leverage unless you have balls of steel. I wouldn't feel comfortable putting anything but a fraction of my holdings on an exchange. So I'd need 100X because I'd only put 2-3% of my coins on the exchange. But then again I don't see any reason to go long. Just buy and hodl.

Let the nuclear engineers engineer the fuel rods. 99.9% of people who opine on the blocksize debate are not intelligent or educated enough to fully understand the ramifications of raising the block size or how second layer scaling will work out.

Core is time-tested and has brought us quite far indeed. Bitcoin has been hugely successful so far, so let's continue to trust Core.

Ver is an idiot, and all of his flock are idiots too, but it's alright. This battle is something that needs to happen if cryptocurrency is going to work. What is happening right now is Bitcoin is proving its antifragility. These attacks by Ver and company are only going to make Bitcoin stronger and more ready for the next wave of attacks by stronger opponents. Attacks on Bitcoin were expected. Bitcoin needs to be able to grow from them in order for Bitcoin to work long-term. All indications are that Bitcoin IS antifragile. It always seems to take one step back and two steps forward. The bad actors will eventually destroy themselves, and the strong hands will be rewarded for their resolve during these "tough" times. (Oh woe is me, we're only up 15x on the year!)

That's not a very good analogy.  A better analogy would be the American government banning banking institutions from dealing with online gambling sites.  That move  pretty much destroyed the US online poker scene.
The bottom line is that for Bitcoin to really make it as a viable alternative to paper currency it needs to be accepted by businesses.  A ban would dry that up lickety split.  If you're a business, you do not want to fuck with the American government.

It doesn't have to. All it has to do is beat the average donk to cut into your winnings. Plus, it's significantly easier to write a winning bot for a small stakes ring game than it is heads up against the best human players in the world. You don't need millions to do that. Bots have been a problem for several years in the micro/small stakes. There have even been a few bot networks suspected in the mid stakes. This is a legitimate concern IMO.

The point of the statement is not that it's a perfect analogy, the point is that a very small percentage of people were interested in the Internet in 1994 because it was slow and had limited benefits at that nascent stage. And people were doubting it. You may have still been too young to have been clued into those conversations, but they were there. But there *was* a lot of potential in the Internet, and as time went by, that potential was realized and more and more people started to use it. The same thing will happen with crypto. It will become easier for the noobs to use, the value of what crypto brings to the table will become more and more apparent, and so, the percentage of people who will want to use it will grow in a manner that is similar to how the internet grew.
That's the point of the statement.
Edit: The argument, "99% of people don't care about X (technology)," has been used against EVERY major new technology that has ever come out: the automobile, the personal computer, credit cards, etc. It's such a bad argument that I think it almost warrants being classified as a logical fallacy. Now, not every new technology takes off, but every new technology that does take off has been subjected to this argument by naysayers. Therefore, it's a pretty worthless argument by itself. Argue against the technology of bitcoin itself, if you want to make a real argument, not simply that most people don't use it yet.

I don't really know, but it would make a lot of sense if it were hedge funds as bitcoin is a highly uncorrelated asset to almost all other assets.

@_date: 2017-08-20 19:33:38
The noob mistake is to view bitcoin as *simply* a currency. It's a currency *and* a store of value. So it's a medium of exchange and an appreciating asset. There are other apps for bitcoin too that currently aren't mature, but which will develop in the coming years. Bitcoin is a totally new asset class. It's not simply currency 2.0, or even gold 2.0—it's cryptocurrency 1.0, something most people don't understand yet.

As someone who has spent some time in the realm of finance, I have to say that I don't see this happening unless advisers can find a way to profit off bitcoin. The vast majority of financial advisers are only interested in selling their clients products that either have high commissions or high renewals. It's a really dirty business. So there will have to be bitcoin mutual funds or bitcoin variable annuities that charge insane fees before we can expect the typical financial adviser to recommend bitcoin to their clients.

@_date: 2017-01-07 22:33:15


It's a true statement though. Just test it out. Spend the next five years arguing with everyone you meet whenever they say something you think is incorrect. Keep at it and try to elucidate them. After five years, analyze how well-liked you are.
Then, spend five years listening to others instead of trying to argue with them. Then analyze how well-liked you are.
I've done this because arguing used to be my default mode. Then I read Benjamin Franklin's autobiography and learned his style of social dynamics and other books on the subject and I changed my modus operandi. It made a huge difference and I realized just how fragile we as humans are with regard to our ego. Hardly anyone enters into an argument to get to the truth. We enter arguments to win, because winning gratifies our ego. This is just human nature 101.
So now I just limit my desire to argue to my anonymous online activities. That's the perfect place for that kind of thing because more people will read your arguments online than will listen to you IRL, and since you have no desire to win influence with someone online, it can't hurt you socially.

You are missing something. The IRS uses a first in, first out method when taxing bitcoins. So you have to declare the first bitcoin price in which you bought whenever you buy something with bitcoin. So if you've been holding for a while, you have declare the earliest price you've bought at, which would lead to a large tax on each purchase, generally.
@_date: 2017-01-01 18:27:23


98% are, and someone who doesn't know finance won't know the difference. The problem with the industry is the profit motive. It's much more profitable to sell high-fee products than to try to do the right thing and charge your clients a flat fee to manage their money. I know this because I was used to be in the industry. 
Being a financial adviser is a very difficult profession. It's almost impossible to launch a career doing the right thing. It's much easier to make it when you can make many thousands off each client by selling them a high-commission product. 
The reason is two fold. First, it's much easier to convince someone to work with you if they don't have to pay you directly. Commissions are somewhat hidden from the consumer and consumers are conditioned to pay them without thinking about it too much. It's much more difficult to get a client to understand that by paying you $100 an hour, they'll pay less in the long run.
Second, clients are *very* hard to acquire. There is intense competition and marketing cost a lot of money. So if you can make 3-10x more money per client by offering a high-commission item, you'll be much more likely to make it in the industry. It's survival of the fittest and it's about the survival of the adviser, not what's in the best interest of the client. Guys with good intentions die off much faster than guys who look after their bottom line first. 
There is massive infrastructure and marketing organizations available to guys who sell high-commission items. There is very little support available to the guys who charge by the hour for advice. They are on their own and are at a big disadvantage in the marketplace. As such, 98% or more of financial advisers are nothing more than salesmen who sell expensive products.
Sorry pal, I know the red pill is hard to take, but this is the way things are in the financial services industry. Research it for yourself, it won't take you long to find out that I'm right. It just is the way it is. The world is not a kind place and the profit motive corrupts many industries. Finance is one of the worst.
Edit: I just want to add that most financial advisers don't know that they are nothing more than simple salesmen. Field marketing organizations spend a ton of money each year to pour their advisers a ton of kool aid to condition them as thoroughly as they do the consumer. Most don't have a background in finance and are just doing what they think is right. They usually get hired by an FMO to get their start and the FMO trains them in their way of thinking that maximizes the goals of the FMO. FMOs spend millions on world-class copywriters to craft a persuasive narrative that the advisers can stomach and pass on to the consumers.

Currency is just one app of bitcoin. A store of value is another. So bitcoin is both a currency AND an asset. There are other apps as well. It's a whole new asset class.

Hedge funds typically have a 2% base fee per year and a 20% fee on gains. I think they're one of the biggest financial scams in history. It's like playing poker with too high of a rake, no way you can win, no matter how skilled a player may be.
@_date: 2017-01-14 22:17:15


I don't believe very many people are wise enough to realize this. The problem with being satisfied with wealth is lifestyle creep. Five million is not a lot of money in Manhattan. If you buy a five million dollar flat in Manhattan, you'll get exposed to people who have a seven or ten million dollar flat. Most people will then try to strive for that level. When they get there, they will mingle with people who have a 15 million dollar flat. This process can continue up to the $100 million dollar flat. Once that's reached, then there is the home in the Hamptons. Then homes in Aspen, Key West, etc.
And once someone owns all that property, they will need millions in pretax income every year to pay property taxes. All they own is at risk if they lose their income. So then they will want liquid assets. But safe returns are low, so even hundreds of millions can't *fully* buy financial security.
And there are a myriad of other avenues of lifestyle creep: private jets, butlers, nannies, gardeners, maids, clubs, vacations, new cars every year. In can be very easy to build a lifestyle that requires many millions a year to maintain. And then there is inflation. Your liquid assets need to grow at 3% a year too. That's a big source of pressure by itself. It's very easy for someone to become consumed by this and let it own them. 
I think the vast majority of people who get a taste of power, won't willingly stop in their quest to accumulate more. I think this is just human nature.

The longer you've been a hodler, the less of an issue this is. The price has been very unstable, but it has upwardly unstable. That's a much better than being very stable and flat. As a hodler, I am not wishing for price stability any time soon. 
If I had a business that transacted in bitcoin, I would not be afraid of price instability either. First, the price is not so unstable that I lose much, if anything, by quickly converting BTC to fiat on all sales. Second, since the price has been steadily climbing, there is huge incentive to retain earnings and hold it in BTC for extra gains. Eventually businesses will figure this out and will actually prefer to take bitcoin over fiat. And they will get stronger for it since they will have a lot more cash on hand.

You're in the perfect situation to go all-in. The question you have to ask yourself is why do you think bitcoin will succeed? I've spent many hours on this question and I think that I know the answer, and the answer is strong, so I'm willing to take on the risk. You can't listen to anyone giving you blanket advise, though, because you don't know what each person knows. You have to do the work yourself and get solid in your own mind whether you believe bitcoin is a black-swan type technology and if you're willing to risk it all to cash in on it if it is.
If you do decide to go all-in, just start thinking about a contingency plan if you're wrong. Start training a skill that you can profit from, for example. Time is the ultimate asset. If you spend your time well, learning valuable skills, you can then assume more risk with your investments because your skills can lead you to more opportunities in the future.

Some of the people making these predictions would disagree with that number. They count more things than just currency, like stocks, real estate, commodities, and the big one, derivatives. I don't know if it's valid or not to include derivatives into the money supply, but if it is, the money supply rockets up into the quadrillion of dollars.
I think there can be a lot of debate as to what the true money supply is as the fiat system we currently have is opaque by design, it seems.

Plus, people fundamentally don't understand what money is and how it works. I think understanding money and banking is the first hurdle people need to jump over to understand the potential of bitcoin. If someone doesn't understand just how flawed the current system is, it would be very hard for them to see the need for cryptocurrency. If you can't see the need, you can't see the utility and it's then very easy to just dismiss bitcoin as a mania bubble.

Why would you believe that's his actual belief system? I think it's much more reasonable to expect someone with his kind of moral history to have maximizing his own power as his primary motivation. I think it's incredibly naive to put any faith in his sense of decency. His history has shown that he's a ruthless Machiavellian who has no problem exploiting and/or destroying others for his own gain. That's going to be the base mindset that motivates his actions IMO.
That said, I think most politicians are this way and have been this way in the past, and yet progress has been made under such circumstances, so I'm not proposing that everything Trump will touch is guaranteed to turn to shit. He could do good. But I also think he's capable of doing a lot of bad (like ditching net-neutrality for example).

We may never see the price drop below $900 or even $950 again. So far the trend has been for bitcoin to rally real fast to a new all-time high and then crash. Then it recovers and rallies again to a new all time high and then it crashes to a point that was higher than the penultimate high. We haven't gone past the previous all-time high, so I think it is not reasonable to expect that it will crash before that time.
But of course, we really don't have enough data to really spot a true pattern or not. Those last few rally-and-crash cycles could be totally random and we're all being fooled by randomness that we're seeing a true pattern.
The reality is the science of price fluctuations is very much up for debate on all sides. No one really knows what's going on with them. I think it's better to approach investing from a perspective of finding intrinsic value. If bitcoin has the intrinsic value to become a major world currency and a store of value and all the other things that bitcoin promises, then we're looking at something that must reach the $100,000 per btc range if it ever reaches its potential (some may argue that specific price-point, but the point is it must go significantly higher).
So until it reaches that point, I'm not too concerned what the price is at any one moment. I'm going to just buy bitcoins whenever I can afford to buy more and hope that I'm right about bitcoin's intrinsic value and that it reaches that potential.
If bitcoin does take off [bigly]( then I think most people who try to predict dips will make way less money than if they were to just buy whenever they can afford to buy more and then just hodl.

Currency is just one app of bitcoin, a store of value asset is another. So it's both of those things. There are other apps too. Bitcoin is a totally new asset class. You can't straight-up compare it to anything that has come before. This is a very confusing concept to fully wrap your head around at first. But just keep studying it and you'll come to understand.

Don't. Financial advisers are mostly just salesmen, and most sell shitty products with high fees. It's impossible to navigate which ones are good and which ones aren't unless you know finance yourself, in which case, you will no longer need a financial adviser and can invest yourself for the lowest fees (use Vanguard for the lowest fees).
 It's really not all that complicated to invest if you play the game of diversification and just try to get the average market return. Trying to beat the market is another game (a game which we who are interested in bitcoin are playing) and takes another level of sophistication. 
Just read these two books and you'll know all you need to know to invest your own money well for the lowest fees. That is if you're playing the simple diversify-and-get-average-market-return game.

The problem is, it's much easier to sell people that you know what you're doing than it is to actually know what you're doing. So the majority of funds out there are nothing more than glorified mutual funds. And with fees that high, even a highly skilled trader could under-perform the market for his clients. It would take the elite-of-the-elite to beat that vig for their clients. That's going to be an infinitesimal minority of hedge funds out there. And good luck getting one of those to take your money.

From there it moved up into the $1,000 range pretty quickly—in about two months, I think.

The higher I think bitcoin is going to go, the more I stand to lose in paying fees. A $50 fee at today's prices could easily be worth $5,000 in future value. So, theoretically, by taking on some risk by having some USD on coinbase, I could be making several thousand dollars a month in future value. 
That's how I view it. I think there is a decently high probability that I'm gaining the equivalent future value in fees not paid each month as I have at risk sitting on coinbase in USD at any one time. 
So I think that even if coinbase is hacked and my USD disappears, I've already come out ahead by the fact that I've been able to buy more bitcoin instead of that money going towards fees. 
If the price doesn't go to the moon, however, my strategy will backfire if coinbase gets hacked. But I'll only stand to lose an additional few thousand dollars. I think it's a well calculated risk.

Of course there is, you still have to live. People cash out stocks and bonds to buy things. Same thing, except that there isn't a middle man with crypto. Currency was deflationary in 19th century and people did just fine. Bitcoin won't always quadruple in value every year. We're still in the very early stages. Eventually, it will grow significantly slower every year. Then there won't be anywhere near the hoarding of it that we see now. 
Right now we're not in the currency phase of bitcoin, we're in the speculation phase. People are estimating the future value of bitcoin to be very high and thus are hoarding it. But every new all time high loosens up the market a bit until we hit a level of maturation where the hoarders will believe they've achieved their future value. Then they WILL spend their bitcoins on cars and houses and such. 
Also, cryptocurrency may never be a currency for micro-transactions. Fiat may still serve that purpose in the future. It may end up that cypto's main functions will be as a store of value and for large transfers between parties. You might buy a house with crypto, but not coffee, for example. This goes to my original point: cryptocurrency is a totally new asset class that is not directly comparable to any other asset class that comes before it. It will probably manifest its functions and uses in ways we haven't foreseen. You can't look to fiat currency or to gold or to any other asset to see how it will manifest. This is something new.

This is a rule meant to protect common people who aren't very sophisticated. This is not the rule for people who genuinely see a real opportunity and are sophisticated enough to fully understand the risk they are taking. [Warren Buffett has some interesting thoughts along these lines.](
The bottom line is that there are many of us who truly believe in bitcoin and think we see something that most don't. We are willing to go all-in to fully seize this opportunity. You can't comment on whether what we are doing is wise or not because you don't know what we know and you don't know what our abilities are to recover if we're wrong.

Seeing these types of pics pop up all over the globe makes me wonder if most of us have underestimated the potential bitcoin may have as simply a store of value. I don't think that the motivation for most of these businesses is for a superior medium of exchange; they instead want to simply get their hands on some coins to store the value. We just learned Overstock is doing this, holding 50% of their bitcoin earnings as an investment. I don't know...I've just got an intuition that we may be vastly underestimating how potent bitcoin's potential as a store of value alone may turn out to be. Especially when you consider the saving mentality of the Asian cultures and just how huge the Asian market is.

I'm actually being kind with that stat. It's probably much higher. I used to be in the industry and have seen first-hand who my competition was and what they were doing. It is very rare to find an adviser who gives low-fee advice.
The reason why this is the way things are is because the infrastructure of the industry has been built to facilitate this type of business. There are no jobs available to young advisers who want to charge a flat rate. The reason there are no jobs is because a field marketing organization could not profit enough to survive if they did business this way. They need their cut to survive, and the only way to get a big enough cut is to sell high-commission products.
Someone who wants to be an adviser who charges a flat fee will most likely have to start their own firm. And then they will have to finance all their marketing themselves. It's very, very hard to make it that way. Most who do have first come up through a traditional high-fee FMO. It takes an exceptional individual to make this type of transition and they will end up making a lot less money per year if they do.


If someone were to get educated enough to be able to do this, then they wouldn't need a financial adviser. They could just invest themselves in low-fee Vanguard funds and save themselves many thousands of dollars. Financial advisers are simple a bad deal for any educated consumer.
It's not that hard to figure out how to manage a portfolio yourself. The two books I mentioned earlier contain more than enough information to do it well. Finance is very complicated if you venture outside of index buying, but is very simple if you stick to just putting your money in indexes.
You will not find a competent financial adviser who can beat the market unless you're worth millions. Even then, you are more likely to be ripped off than to find a genius. It's very simple to learn the difference between stock indexes, bond indexes, REIT indexes, foreign indexes, and how to balance them based off of your age and financial situation. A financial adviser who plays that game will charge you many thousands of dollars to do the 10-20 hours of work it would take you to figure it out yourself. 
And if you're not capable of understanding how to do it yourself, you're not capable of being able to find a competent financial adviser.

I think this is dangerous thinking when it comes to investing in bitcoin. Either you believe in bitcoin, or you don't. If you do, just buy and hold. You're going to be much more likely to come out ahead than if you try to time the market.
The reason why I say this is because if bitcoin does reach its potential its very possible that it could reach $200,000 in ten years. It could even go bigger than that faster. If bitcoin does reach $200,000 ten years from now, the annual average return will be 72.43%. And most of those gains will probably be made in the earlier parts of that decade. So we could see the next few years earn a couple or even a few hundred percent gains and the last few years some solid double digit gains.
So, if you believe in bitcoin, you shouldn't be afraid of rapid rises in price while we are still in the nascent stage like we are now.

I don't think you have enough information to make this statement with any certainty. If one owns a lot of bitcoins, it's prudent to spread that out over many addresses. It's very possible that a 10-1 ratio exists of wallets to people at that level. My personal ratio is higher than that and it's gong to continue to grow as I acquire more bitcoins. My copay app does this automatically and its cumbersome to do it any other way, so I think the most accurate assumption is that most people who hold large amounts of bitcoin do this as well. Therefore, a high ratio of wallets to people most likely exists.

I wouldn't listen to this guy. Either you believe in bitcoin or you don't. If you do, then buy and hold. If you don't, find an investment that you do believe in. 
If bitcoin succeeds, then it will go to the moon eventually. If it doesn't, it will remain a novelty at best and do nothing or lose its value completely.
This guy seems to be taking a [castle-in-the-air]( approach to bitcoin. That may work for the elite of the elite traders, but 98% of everyone else will get their ass handed to them if they try this approach. It is very unlikely that anyone espousing a castle-in-the-air opinion on bitcoin's current price knows what they are talking about. Anyone who does know what they are talking about would likely keep their mouth shut.

It depends on your income and the nature of your work. One thing most people forget when thinking about their portfolio is that they own their own human capital. This is like a bond. If you work a blue-collar job that is going to destroy your body by age 60, your bond is tiny. If you're in a job that can be easily lost, your bond is tiny.
However, if you're self-employed in a well-established business that you can work until you die, happily, your bond is huge. The more robust your skills are, the more job security you have, and the longer in your life you can theoretically work, the bigger your bond is.
The bigger your bond is, the more risk tolerance you can have.

It is my view that only the elite of the elite traders know when and if a dip is coming. I think that everyone else would profit better with just a buy and hold approach. An unskilled trader would most likely miss many significant up-runs in the attempt to catch a dip. They will lose more by missing out on the up-runs than they will gain when they occasionally do predict a dip.
So I guess the question you have to ask yourself is this: are you an elite trader? If you're certain you are, then by all means, go ahead and try to increase your profits by trading. Just know that if you're wrong about your ability, you'll will make significantly less money than if you just buy and hold.
I know I'm not a trader. But even if I thought there were a good chance that I was, I would probably still not try to trade. My reasoning is that I think a [firm-foundation-theory]( approach to investing in bitcoin is going to be so profitable that it doesn't make much sense to risk that by trying to trade. I feel my fortune is assured by the easy buy-and-hold approach and I don't want to risk that for a marginally larger fortune. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, as is often said.

I think that would be the wise move, but I'm not sure $1,000,000 per bitcoin would make the USD irrelevant. It may have to go higher for that.
But I agree, were talking about a world that will look very different than it is now if bitcoin were to get to that level. It would be a true black swan event and would disrupt things so much that we can't know much for certain at this point in time.
I know one thing though, I want as many bitcoins as I can get my hands on in that scenario.

Just know that almost everyone who has invested in bitcoin feels the same way.

There is a legitimate reason why the OP wants to do this. Probably the same reason why I do it: to avoid paying fees. If you have a balance of USD on coinbase, you can then transfer it to GDAX and avoid paying fees. 
The reason why I do it is because I buy bitcoins every month and don't want to wait the 6 days it takes to deposit USD. There are two reasons for this. First, I get paid monthly, so I'm going to buy more than the $1,000 weekly deposit limit on USD for the entire month (my weekly bitcoin deposit limit is $10,000). So it would take more than one week worth of deposits to make my monthly bitcoin buy. Second, I believe that bitcoin is going to the moon, so by waiting 2-3 weeks to get my buys in, it's the equivalent of paying a significant fee.
So the solution for me is to have a portion of my risk-free savings sitting on coinbase in USD so that I can move it into bitcoin once my paycheck replenishes it in my money market account. Then the rest of the month I move my risk-free savings from my money market account to my coinbase account in anticipation of next month's bitcoin buy.
I'm also interested in how much risk I'm taking by doing this. I only hold a small portion of my risk-free funds on coinbase, so so-far I've been willing to take the increased risk to get the better prices on bitcoin.

It's not about definition, it's that the math is wrong if you were to try to use it to predict price and what needs to transpire to achieve certain future prices. Price does fit in that simple formula. You couldn't work with the two other variables (if you knew them (which you couldn't)) and get price because the formula is wrong for that purpose. All market cap is, is a metaphor. It's like saying that a bunch or rings and balls is a model of an atom. It helps one understand an atom on one level, but an atom looks nothing like what the model looks like in actuality. Nor does the atom behave anything like a model of rings and balls. Same concept here. Just don't try to use the market cap metaphor for things it's not suited for, which is anything to do with predicting future prices.

I can go much bigger than that. First, look at [this infographic]( to get an idea of the size of various assets classes out there. (This list is not comprehensive, but good enough for rough figuring.) 
Second, the whole idea bitcoin's market cap being price * total supply is flawed. Much of the total supply is either lost, or simply not on the market because of hardcore hodling. As price increases, the % of coins that are off the market because of hardcore hodling will decrease, however, I do not think that we'd need 16.6 trillion of value to flow into bitcoin at the current supply to reach a price of 1 million dollars per coin. I think it would be more like 10-15 trillion. And that's only 5-7.5% of the total bond market.
And when you start thinking through the whole gamut of uses for bitcoin, from currency, to store of value, to (future) smart contracts, to the even more outer edges of what the tech can do, one million per bitcoin does not seem all that big.

@_date: 2018-03-12 06:50:04
I think I'll explain a little further why this doesn't have to happen. Imagine that there is only one exchange (for simplicity's sake). And let's say that someone has exactly one bitcoin for sale for 9500. I see that and I buy it. So I give some guy 9500, and some guy gives me one bitcoin. The next sell bid is $1 higher, so technically the price is now 9501. So in that transaction, $16,790,000 worth of market cap was created ($1 * 16,790,000 bitcoins). But all that really happened, though, was I gave someone some cash and they gave me one bitcoin. Certainly, 16 million dollars of value was not created in that transaction.
That just goes to show how unreal market cap is. It's an abstract number that doesn't represent anything real. Abstractions can have their place, but they can't be worked backward in an equation to find real values, like price. So you can't assume that 22 trillion in value needs to "flow" into bitcoin for a one million dollar price. That assumption is assuming that market cap determines price, but it's the other way around. Market cap is unreal; price is real. Price * Supply can create an abstraction like market cap, but you cannot divide a hypothetical market cap by supply to say anything about a future price. It makes no sense to do so.

Because *they* want bitcoin. Until that happens, there is no value in vendors accepting bitcoin. A bunch of people pretending they want to spend bitcoin to vendors who then just sell it back on the market immediately won't increase adoption at all. You're trying to manipulate the market here, nothing more. You don't really want to spend bitcoin, and you won't keep it up because the fees are high and because overall it's a hassle; so all you're doing is increasing the supply of bitcoin in the short term by having the vendor you sell yours to sell it back to the market, thus driving price down.
No one is going to keep up this charade. People won't spend bitcoin until it makes sense to do it. Not until lightning matures and the price matures. And that's okay. There are three principles of money: store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account. Store of value is going to come first, then medium of exchange, and then unit of account. And it will come *organically*, not through market manipulation. *We* don't need to do a damn thing with our bitcoin unless it makes sense to do it. We DO NOT need thousands of people trying to manipulate the market. Bitcoin will evolve on its own and it will evolve organically.
The last thing we want to do is pressure merchants to accept bitcoin and then nobody actually spends it. That's what would happen if people listened to the people pushing this (old) argument. We've already seen this line of thinking fail with merchants who were pressured by people to accept bitcoin who then discontinued to accept it because nobody used it.
This is bitcoin noob argument 101. It hasn't worked in the past because it's a stupid argument that's really arguing that bitcoin won't make it unless we manipulate the market artificially. Hogwash. Bitcoin is doing just fine and it doesn't need any artificial manipulation.

That would only work if they held a portion of the bitcoins they receive. If they immediately sell the bitcoins they accept back on the open market, it should increase supply and thus decrease price. Not many people will buy bitcoin just to buy something on Amazon. Most likely, Amazon accepting bitcoin would tempt old-school hodlers to sell a little bit of their stack to splurge.
For example, I have a 9,000 watch on my Amazon wish list. If I were a bitcoin whale, and Amazon started accepting bitcoin, I'd probably buy it with bitcoin. So I would be increasing supply. But if I were a bitcoin whale, I would not sell bitcoin to get fiat to then buy that watch. I'd wait. There are too many steps involved in the latter case. That's enough to stop an impulse buy.
This all comes down to [Gresham's Law]( Basically, people will spend bad money before they spend good money. So people are not going to buy bitcoin just to buy something on Amazon. They will prefer to use less valuable fiat. 
Adoption is going to come the opposite way. Bitcoin's price will rise to a point where people will want to spend it. THEN merchants will feel pressured to accept bitcoin. And many of them won't want to resell it back on the market. They will want to hodl bitcoin themselves. This was always the problem I had with the brigading of bitcoiners to pressure companies to accept bitcoin. It was going about things backwards. It does no good to force that. It has to develop organically.

It's people who talk about market cap that make me crazy. It's an abstract number, not a real "thing". If bitcoin's price were $1,000,000, it wouldn't mean that 22 trillion dollars is sitting in bitcoin. Bitcoin is not an account where dollars can be stored. People trade dollars for bitcoin or bitcoin for dollars; the differences in demand and supply creates a price where the two can be exchanged. So for bitcoin to reach any price, it doesn't mean that a certain sum of market cap has to be deposited into some account, it just means that the current supply and demand for bitcoin vs dollars has to reach a certain level. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 02:02:58
First of all, 4 million coins have been lost; second, market cap is not a real thing. You can't determine price by dividing market cap by supply. In your scenario, you could not liquidate 21 trillion dollars out of bitcoin. If some large supply started to sell, the price would drop exponentially and a large portion of market cap, being the unreal thing that it is, would vanish into the void.
Price is determined by current buying and selling demand and supply. Market cap does not work like a bank account where a definite amount of value can be stored. Small discrepancies of supply and demand can "create" or "destroy" a much larger number in terms of market cap. So 21 trillion dollars of value is not needed to create a 21 trillion dollar market cap. It's not even close to that.

It will also increase supply, because Amazon won't hodl, it will sell the coins it gets on the open market. In the phase we're in now, most of the people who are buying coins are taking them off the market. People who just buy coins to buy stuff on Amazon will just be cycling those coins back into the supply pool. Plus, long time hodlers would probably start to spend some of their coins on Amazon, thus increasing supply. So when Amazon comes on board, if the move doesn't also create a psychological reason for more speculation (buying and hodling) of bitcoin in tandem, I'd expect the price to go down.

Because spending bitcoin to a vendor who just sells it back on the open market doesn't accomplish a damn thing. All you're doing is trying to force adoption. Adoption has to arise organically.

Research more thoroughly. I came across an article a few months ago that talked about how there is a big problem with banks forgetting certain KYC info when registering safety deposit boxes and then later drilling open the boxes and putting them in storage. Owners were able to get their stuff, but some of the people had jewellery broken because of the drilling of the box. I think a lawsuit is in the works over this. But anyway, the point is that because of bureaucratic mishaps, safe deposit boxes do get confiscated and drilled into. In the article that I read, the people were able to eventually get their property after correcting the paper work, but a bitcoin private key would be something that could be stolen without actually taking anything out of the box, so a rogue employee may be temped to do just that. It's probably a very small risk, but it's a risk nonetheless.

If it's extremely unrealistic, I don't see how it could be a cool thought experiment. In my mind, a thought experiment is only cool if it's realistic.

He calculated that if Millennials put 15% of the income they are going to invest from now until 2030, bitcoin should reach a price of 10 million. I've worked with my own models, and being very conservative, have come up with a five million dollar price.

I don't know about this. Most of the great minds are only known for one thing from the general public. This applies to even Newton, I think. Most only associate Newton to the laws of motion, not to calculus or to optics. I think to the average person, the fact that Satoshi disappeared will strengthen his image, not weaken it. It makes him more of a mystery, and that makes for a much better story. And I think the average person is more captivated by story than anything else, so I see Satoshi becoming a legend at minimum and a cult figure at the other extreme. (You know that's going to happen, right? There will be a cult in the future that worships Satoshi Nakamoto—maybe it will only be 50 weirdos, but it will happen. Shit, it probably already has.)

When I first got into the bitcoin space, I was technically illiterate when it came to the tech behind bitcoin.

Eventually, I educated myself enough so that I now think that I'm technically knowledgeable enough to understand the blocksize debate, but even before I reached that point, I started to suspect something fishy about r/btc.
r/btc was all about negativity and r/bitcoin was all about optimism. r/bitcoin always had real news about real, noteworthy developments in the bitcoin space, whereas r/btc was mostly filled with angry posts predicting doom for bitcoin. Eventually, I just stopped reading r/btc because it was too much of a drag.

If market cap shrunk by 1/3 (and supply stayed the same), of course price also shrunk by 1/3. That's because to get market cap, you multiply price by supply. But that doesn't mean that to get $X more in market cap, $X amount of dollars is necessary. It might be 1/1000X or 1000X. It depends on discrepancies in supply and demand.
I posted this a while back to give people an idea of how unreal market cap is.
"Imagine that there is only one exchange (for simplicity's sake). And let's say that someone has exactly one bitcoin for sale for 9500. I see that and I buy it. So I give some guy 9500, and some guy gives me one bitcoin. The next sell bid is $1 higher, so technically the price is now 9501. So in that transaction, $16,790,000 worth of market cap was created ($1 * 16,790,000 bitcoins). But all that really happened, though, was I gave someone some cash and they gave me one bitcoin. Certainly, 16 million dollars of value was not created in that transaction."

Price doesn't work like that. Bitcoin is not an account where dollars are stored. Market cap is a very deceptive number. It's an abstract number. It's not holding a real thing, like an account. It could be that no where near $450,000,000 is needed to create $450,000,000 of market cap, or that much, much more is actually needed to do the same. Price is determined by discrepancies between supply and demand, not by the difference between credits and debits on a ledger. The final balance of a ledger is a real thing; market cap is just an abstraction.
Honestly, I wish everyone would just stop talking about market cap. It's not an important number.

Eventually, but not at any one time. This is what drives price. When there are more buyers than sellers, the buyers compete for the sellers by raising the price of their bids.

This is very possible because the US government classifies bitcoin as a commodity, not a currency. So you have to declare even purchases made with bitcoin if they have a capital gain. Ex: If you purchase 1 bitcoin for $650 and then spend it when it's valued at $700; you have to declare $50 as a capital gain. So because of this I keep a spreadsheet of all my transactions.

One of the future application will be the ability to make micro loans. I heard Andreas Antonopoulos talk about this to the Canadian Senate. Essentially, there will be companies that will allow you to loan small amounts to many different debtors. Many people will fund one debtor. So you'll be able to diversify your risk.
If you invest in highly rated corporate bonds, you can expect about a two percent default rate. Despite this default rate, you'll still make a good return if you're invested in a bond fund that diversifies your risk well. The default rate really doesn't lower the rate of return that all that much. I remember being shocked at how little it affects return rate when I learned about this in my econ class.
So if a start-up creates a bond fund that will sufficiently diversify your loans for you, you should be able to earn a few percent return on your money while also being able to participate in capital gains of bitcoin against currency. That would be a sweet investment vehicle and could bring cheap credit to many people. That's a very transformative thing.
Edit: clarification and grammar.

The really valuable of those points benefit the seller, not the buyer.

No. You can get a broker to directly find you buyers. I'm not sure how to do this however; I just know it's done. r/bitcoinbeginners might know.

Like what? Compared to buying with a credit card that is.

See, they already have those benefits.


Here's the thing though, I got a 10% discount for buying Modafinil, which is illegal for me to get where I'm at. I was buying it oversees, so they were most likely trying to avoid the high international transfer fees. At a regular retailer the seller won't be able to give more than about 1% discount because they only save a couple percent by taking bitcoin over credit cards. I already get a 1% savings with my credit card. Those paying cash or with a debit card probably won't be too motivated to learn how to use bitcoin for such a small savings. 
I think bitcoin will get its most growth for things like remittances, as currency in countries with high inflation, and as a store of value in first-world countries.
I think the things you've laid out have value, but I see them as being motivators quite a bit down the road for first-world countries. I think once bitcoin is shown to be a very good store of value, people here will value it more as currency. But I don't think it will get much traction here as a currency before that (except by enthusiasts).

Yeah, and you're limited to a .75 btc limit for each trade when trading dollars for btc. That requires a lot of work to move a decent sum of money. It has a long way to go.

Yeah, the problem was with the state polling. The national polls were actually quite accurate leading up to the election. It turned out there wasn't a good enough sample of state polls for them to be accurately predicted.

The first two. The rest aren't that important to a consumer. That argument you laid out won't impress someone who is unfamiliar with bitcoin. On the second point, the consumer will not be aware of that unless the business gives a discount on the spot for using bitcoin. However, I have seen business do that, so then your point will be valid (and powerful).

No sell price for me, at least not in fiat. I'm thinking about the mansion I'll buy *with* bitcoin.

Okay, now I'm confused. What's with the four-day wait time then if you can do multiple trades?

I store the majority of my bitcoins with a paper wallet generated at bitaddress and I have a copay app on my iphone. If I ever want to spend some bitcoins then I can just sweep the private key into my copay app. It's really easy. Just take a picture and you're done.
