Indeed. All said and done, and ETF may not turn out to be in the best interests of Bitcoin.

Certainly. But the ramifications of an instability in the USD has more far reaching consequences. That said, I respect your opinion. Thanks!

Well, a commentary on adoption is meaningless without studying the underlying issues—which does concern the economy.

Well, there is a potential for a tremendous bull run in the near horizon, courtesy Bitcoin ETF via the CBOE application. Bitcoin *does* have an uncanny resemblance to gold, and when the gold ETF took place, its prices rose 478% – which is one hell of a bull run.
Since the earliest the decision of SEC could come through is 16th August, I would say the Bull is resting while it can. :-)

Certainly, the thing with gold was a one trick pony; while it has remained a reservoir of safety people turn to in times of uncertainty, it can never explode like that again. (Unless we see another global meltdown...) Bitcoin, on the other hand, is yet to realise its full potential, still remaining more or less on the sidelines of the formal fiat economy running the world today. An ETF for Bitcoin would thus be much more significant, signalling the entry of the premier cryptocurrency into the mainstream financial markets, sparking a renewed interest and faith in it.
As such, a bull run for Bitcoin could well do *better* than the historic gains of gold, and possibly even keep outperforming it in the future.
