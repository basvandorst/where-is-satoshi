No please, maybe u read it wrong or I typed it wrong. I never mentiined by-passing 2FA
I was logged off the blockchain app. I tried logging in online, it requested 2FA code, WC was supposed to be sent to my phone, i didn't receive it. I sent a mail to remove 2FA. Then came online to see how fast it could be done. But all I saw was people complaining of waiting for weeks. I am only interested in how fast blockchain reply the request so I can gain access to my account.
I just need to hear from people who had similar issues and how they got it resolved.
