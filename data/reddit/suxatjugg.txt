I have a lot of investments in lots of different financial instruments, and I feel no need to explain any of it to my parents. 
Wife is different because it's her money too, but she understands that investments can go up and down, she has equities too, and we only invest money we can genuinely afford to lose. 
Friends, depends on your friends. If they either too stupid or unsupportive of you, honestly I'd reconsider why you consider them friends. I have friends with investments in crypto that I don't think are sensible, but it's their money and they're my friends, so I'm polite about it, and don't give them a hard time, and they treat me the same regarding bitcoin or anything else I'm invested in.

So you are only buying small amounts of btc and then immediately spending it?

Unless you've got a solid prenup, I doubt this.

The difference is that you're claiming it's not an investment, and to support that you implied you're buying bitcoin the same way a traveller buys local currency to be able to spend it in the short term. But I don't believe you and you're just spouting things you've heard Andreas say without really understanding it.

Most people with significant money on exchanges are just looking to make fiat, the kind of people who would come to this sub are not leaving their btc on exchanges
