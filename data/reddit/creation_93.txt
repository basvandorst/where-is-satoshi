Because experts who are in thuis business for a long time know that if they buy all arround the same time and sell all arround the same time, they can double and triple their bitcoin ammount by taking advantage of relatively new players.  I m not going in before i see 5  and i m pretty sure the biggest players are gonna put buy orders sub 5k .  But this is just my reality of how bitcoin chart works and everyone in this reddit will claim to know better than me

Then wtf are you doing here. Discouraging people from buying because you dont have the balls to do it?  Then later price goes up ans you convince yourself that you did well to not buy? People like u exist since 5 years. I just love to brag about the money i make with btc to everyone who is like you.  Nothin feels better than seeing ball-less likeminded people like you right? Just pitufull.  Everyone here knows the risks. But we wanna be positive through it. So we gather here.  What are you doing here instead?

Most people have no intention. Like 95 percent of total population right now. But people here want to invest or they wouldnt be here. My advice is for the people who plan to invest. Dividing assets at different limits is a good investing strategy that works . In the sense that the risk is not too big for possible big gains.  Also i am succesfull so from my point i am just telling other people how i manage my investments.  What good are you bringing i stead? Talking about risks that anyone with a minimum ammount of iq already knows?  We already know what u have to say. So pls stfu with ur negativity, thats not needed

I see you like to discourage people from getting into bitcoin. When history has proven time and time again that investing worth it. And even if history is no evidence for the future, it serves as an indicator.   I hope you get banned for your discouraging comments. This is supposed to be a pro- bitcoin subreddit

Ok guys 9k breached now for the 2nd time. I advice you to buy in with 30 percent of your money now. 40 percent at 9500 and all in  at 10k.   Do what u want with this advice

Stop looking for 1 hour. Then look again.  A 200 euro dip isnt a dip at this point.  Just go relax and come back later.  The bottom brice has been going from 7.9 to 8.8 over the last hours. So just relax it may be that in some houts the dips will reach max 9.5 
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:28:19
I think its fair to buy in at 9k and if it goes past 9.5 go all in
