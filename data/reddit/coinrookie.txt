I know you're a legend around these parts, and have amassed a huge amount of BTC wealth by being in the right place at the right time 5 years ago, but don't say BTC doesn't have counterparty risk.

This is because you haven't been alive long enough to appreciate the quantum of improvement over a 20 year time horizon.
In 20 years, we've gone from 14.4kbps dial-up to 1,000,000 kbps (1 Gbps), with 10,000,000 kbps around the corner, and 20,000,000 kbps being available on wireless 5G by 2020.
So, the last 20 years saw a 1-million-times improvement - you're telling me that in the next 20, we may only see a 2 or 3x improvement.
Either you're a short-sighted moron, or 17. I can't think of any other option.
Full 8Gb blocks would probably mean that BTC is getting close to $100,000 each (if not more) if it's handling that kinda transaction volume. If you're a "Bitcoin believer" you should be carrying at least 10BTC now - so the fiat expense of running a node will be relative pittance.
You can't have a Bitcoin with full 8GB blocks with a price of $250 per coin.
If the 8GB blocks fill up, we are all going to be rich beyond our current imagination.

There are people in the community (I would argue, several), that would need the price to go 3-4x to just break even.
So the "huge" 5-10x gain you're talking about will need BTC to go 15-40x....
It has beyond doubt been the most mentally and financially stressful 19 months, buying every single dip, and still needing 2.2x from here to get to my break-even.

I'm not denying it can be changed. Forking bitcoin is a 2 minute exercise, and the fork of the newer, higher supply coin may be the one this toxic and ignorant community decides to start mining. But the original, 21m coin version, will be perpetual and parallel to the newer higher supply shitcoin.   
The main points to extract are that the community would have to turn much dumber than it already is, which is difficult to imagine, for anyone to even think of agreeing to raise the supply and make themselves poorer

I still believe in crypto (it will succeed because it is superior from an evolutionary point of view) - but I say that Bitcoin's extinction event has happened (Mt Gox), and it will die by the end of 2015.  
No, the dinosaurs didn't die instantly from the asteroid - it took a few years for everything to die out due to the after-effects. Mt Gox was the asteroid, and we are now witnessing the exponential drip to $0. I'm expecting a 5% drop every week until we get to zero in about 70 weeks or so.

I think the people calling for stability are either mentally retarded, or simply don't understand simple economics.
A stable bitcoin price indicates that bitcoin has failed. So, you want market cap of BTC to "stable-out" at $3 billion. Yeah - sounds like a true world-beating technology/currency you have there.
BTC market cap needs to reach $50bn by end of 2015, or its over. A stable $50bn is what will make BTC succeed - not a stable $3bn.

Although I can relate to you in a huge way (I personally joined the ecosystem 13 months ago as soon as I learned about it for social justice reasons), but it would appear only 1% of the community cares about social, economic, political and technological impact - the other 99% are just interested in getting rich quick. Unfortunately, for people like you and I, and this has been the case throughout history, moral and honest people will continue to get fucked in the ass by the greedy and immoral. Until the end of times.  
With that kind of ratio, Bitcoin is unfortunately doomed.  
Short it to $0, and keep your eyes peeled for the next big crypto. You're still lucky enough to be in the space to be an early adopter to whatever comes next. Just be careful of all the scam-coins that will come along.

I'm just a bag-holding moron that would like to see bitcoin succeed, but also be rewarded for the huge risk I took 13 months ago.
A $3bn BTC market cap is UTTERLY USELESS, a $50bn one is less useless (but still pretty useless).
I shouldn't have used the sentence "a stable $50bn". Basically, bitcoin can only be stable at one price, and that price is $0. If Bitcoin is stable, it is failing. This is how finite money works. There needs to be periods of stability sometimes, sure, but if it's "stable" it means that it has stopped growing.
Also, it's very very difficult to transfer $100m of wealth when bitcoins are worth fuck-all.

At $0.1, it would have been long dead. I would even be confident of saying that if price were to drop to the double digits mark again, consider it irreparably damaged and effectively dead.

I'm not sure if people don't understand this due to mental retardation, or just plain ignorance / inability to do basic mathematics - but - once bitcoin is spent, it is spent forever. Gone. That's it.
With fiat, once it is spent (at the 0.01% level), new fiat is simply reprinted to replenish the stocks. The 99.99% don't have this luxury, and hence, witness their wealth being diluted over time, and witness ever increase wealth and income inequality.
I repeat, if I hold 1,000,000 BTC, and spend 1,000,000 BTC, my balance is now ZERO BTC. If I want to get my 1,000,000 BTC back, I have to earn it somehow by creating value. This will get increasingly harder to do over time, as in theory, Bitcoin is a deflationary currency.

Problem with r/bitcoin is that $10/month is deemed "fucking expensive" by the vast majority of failed losers here with shit careers who are currently broke and will always be broke.

Here's a running sheet
- For a product to succeed commercially, it either has to be twice as good, or half the price. As an Aussie, you should know that charging a 1% fee for processing a BTC transaction is highway robbery, as our banks charge SIGNIFICANTLY less than the US. Avg. fees paid by all the merchants I tried to sell this bullshit technology to had their sphincters clench up at a 1% fee, as they were paying CBA only 1.5%. The pay PayPal a similar amount.  
- Local Aussie products are ugly as fuck, and are html based. The good looking stuff is too expensive to use. It's not rocket science to make a clean looking app that you can log into as a merchant, and provide "staff accounts" so that you aren't running an entire business' POS system on the manager's phone only. You're competing with the likes of CBA Cardless Cash, ANZ Go Money, PayPass/Wave etc. etc. etc. The programming community keeps saying "yeah, but it's hard" / "it needs testing" / "etc.". Bullshit. If CBA and ANZ have figured it out, and have had it figured out for years - this just means that all the competent people are working for the banks, not bitcoin.  
- You can't charge a 2% broker fee on top of a 3% spread (See CoinJar)
- It is an open-source environment, which, micro-economically, means that competition is futile, and you WILL fail. The way to counter-act this is through collaboration. What do I mean by this? Well, if your company just focuses on processing transactions, or just brokering, or just *insert niche useless feature here*, your company is a failure right off the bat. Unless you're emulating the Coinbase model (i.e. a place where you can buy, sell, process payments, multi-sig vault, etc.) - your company has failed, as 99% of people don't want to have to sign up to 4 sketchy companies to be able to participate in the BTC ecosystem. Signing up to one robust company is key. However, most Bitcoiners I've met are too short-sighted, too stupid, and too greedy to take such an approach. Everyone wants their shit narrow start-up to succeed, and theirs only.  
After all this time hanging around in the bitcoin ecosystem, it is not faith in the technology that I've lost, but faith in the community. There is a clear disdain for anyone educated, and anyone who acknowledges that there is in fact zero new about Bitcoin except for the discovery of digital scarcity through a distributed mathematical proof-based network. It is exactly like a commodity good, but people refuse to look at it like that.
It is NOT different this time. I look forward to the day when the early adopters who wouldn't know shit from shoe-polish when it comes to business and economics are replaced by professionals. Then, we might have a chance of seeing Bitcoin flourish.

With regards to the "thin-air-produced" Chain B coins, why would they be able to be made out of thin air? I'm guessing it's because they don't have to somewhat, in principle, mirror the main protocol? Or can sidechains be an "anti-bitcoin" in protocol, yet still be pinned to it?

All of the building blocks are there - and there are no reasons one of these can't be made for Bitcoin. 
This video is probably where I'd imagined Bitcoin would be by now in terms of UX when looking ahead back in late 2013. I had a pretty good feelings that banks would be at Albert-level by now as well - and with all the skill in the open source community, I'm sure with a bit of focus, something like this could be knocked together relatively quickly.   
I suppose this video is proof of concept of what big money thrown at a problem can do, if nothing else. I don't know why all Hackathons aren't being directed towards Albert-level UX - it's not like success on this front won't make the creators handsomely rich...  
A totally unsubstantiated statement here, but if the same focus was put on delivering a cool UX as was put on altcoin development and short-selling, we probably would have been on the same level of UX tech as the "dirty legacy banking system" by now.

Your analysis is unfortunately wrong (for several reasons which I won't outline here)
Here's a correct one, albeit very very very detailed (almost too detailed): 
Energy usage/expenditure is significantly less than what you estimate. Electricity only makes up about 30% of the cost to mine, with the other 70% being CAPEX to acquire mining equipment.

Agree 100%
So, then, how can you honestly and truly stand next to such research then? I don't mean to be a dick, but your conclusions and number percentages are meaningless and say nothing. it's a tough situation to be in for you, due to the multivariable nature of what you're trying to study.  
You might be onto something in theory, but I think you need to spend some more time at the drawing board identifying and accounting for different variables before you can quantify anything and have it be valuable.
But, please, don't have the arrogance to say that it hasn't been a bad year (well, 17 months actually) for bitcoin by saying in hindsight that "dip-buying" is a profitable pursuit.
As a hodler who has bought every single dip since first buying in at the top in November 2013, I'm luckily only down 40% instead of 80% - but by no stretch of the imagination has this been anything but the year and a half from hell.

Vicious cycle. If it catches enough downward momentum (i.e. more downward momentum than now, if you can imagine), the only way to go is zero - especially if all "fiat cash-out" avenues get closed along the way due to said avenues going bankrupt due to lack of business/profit.
@_date: 2015-04-28 08:36:34
Indeed. At $2500/BTC in 2020 (roughly 18m coins mined by then) would give BTC a "market cap" of $45bn.
It should be noted that, based on Wall Street Analysts projections (and they are pretty good at projecting these things), Apple will be valued at over $1 trillion by 2020, assuming about 8% year-on-year growth.  
Just some perspective....  
If bitcoin isn't $10,000+ per coin by 2020, the price will most likely be $0. Thanks to finite supply, it really is truly a matter of moon or zero. There is very little space for "in between".
@_date: 2015-04-07 08:37:35

Look at the past 17 months. The gross majority of "sideways stable" periods end in blood and tears. Usually to the tune of 20-30%.

I agree. Bitcoin allows the pseudonymous transfer of fiat over the internet.
Don't for a minute think that drug dealers are interested in holding BTC. They want to get paid in fiat for their drugs, as fiat is the preferred currency of their suppliers. The best way for them to do that is to get paid in BTC, and then cash the BTC out into fiat.

So, the 3 biggest BTC companies are now valued at 1/3 the market cap of all BTC ever mined. Throw in the Bitpays, Bitstamps, and Krakens of the world, and all the bitcoin companies combined are probably valued more than all the BTC currently mined.

I believe most bitcoin users to be broke or near-broke, as only $1,000,000 of new money needs to enter the ecosystem each day to keep the price where it is, yet, this money isn't finding its way to the ecosystem. Like it or lump it, $1 million is NOTHING these days, and if there really are 1 million BTC users, a dollar a day to keep the trendline going in an upward direction is not a huge sacrifice. $3/day each (i.e. the cost of a morning coffee), and the price would be somewhere near $850/coin.
TL;DR - Most Bitcoiners are broke-ass mofo's banking on the fact that bitcoin will make them rich. There are actually extremely few rich people in the ecosystem atm. Broke people usually need to tap into savings during huge recessions/crashes =&gt; Bitcoin will take one in the ass when "the crash" finally hits.

In hopes to hear something new and ground-breaking.
Regardless, it's important that these videos are made so that people can learn about the glaringly obvious.

Ignore ignorant trolls who can't do math. You will never reach them. Save your energy for other things ;)

We already have 1200 trillion in JUST derivatives floating around.   
@ 10% Year on Year (YoY) growth for 200 years, this equates to 227,886,331,752.5 trillion (almost 228 billion trillion)
@ 5% YoY, it equates to 20,751,097 (almost 21 million trillion).
Do math. It's good for your health.  
**HINT**: The formula you want to use is the compound growth formula, where F = P(1+i)^n, where F = future value, P = present value, i = period growth rate, and n = number of periods. In this case, P = 1200 trillion, i = say, 10%/year, and n = 200 years.

The technical answer is actually closer to the heat-death of our sun

I managed mine by getting a degree that was useful to society which pays a touch more than the slave rate of $12/hr
I wish you all the best, but I'm afraid there are too many broke people in the BTC community praying that BTC will make them rich. We need more rich people in the space who can boost the price for us and start another FOMO wave / media hype cycle.

It's not so much pity, as it is the majority of people I know earn anywhere between $26 and $56 per hour - so really, $100 is fuck-all money.
And yeah, I've looked silly non-stop for 19 months "predicting price". For the next 19, I'm not gonna predict what the exact price will be, just that it is going downwards until a rich person with 10-15 mil to blow on an open exchange comes and rescues us from the current crop of early-adopting bearwhales.

Yes. They have degrees showing that they completed study at Harvard and Oxford. There is a very very very small percentage of university students in general, let alone the population of the entire world, that can say they have achieved this.
Getting into Harvard or Oxford alone means you beat out a LOT of special / genius people. Sticking it out and passing your degree is just as special. It's nothing to sneeze at.
They're still young and at the start of their careers - and with their background, connections and (inherited) wealth, it won't be long until their impact on "the market" is felt.
But to say they aren't smart/special after getting degrees from both Harvard and Oxford, as well as competing at Olympic level, is either arrogant and disingenuous at best, or crippling jealousy at worst.

Every time I watch one of these videos I think "how did people not know this before by just reading the whitepaper?"  
Then I remember that the majority of people are short-sighted and ignorant, and can't think of possibilities like this by themselves
@_date: 2015-03-25 02:16:10
Yes, I understand this.
Total VC investment: $1bn  
Total Market Cap: $4bn  
It doesn't add up, except that broke-ass mofos are spending precious little money supporting the rich people setting up ventures.
Until the 1% starts looking at BTC more positively to the tune where we can scratch together the cost of a Lamborghini every day between 10 million people (hint, it's about 10 cents each per day), then we are going all the way down to $10/coin as the Bitcorn prophecy foretold.
Even at $10/coin, most of you guys would barely have enough to buy 10BTC if what I'm lead to believe around here is true (i.e. $100 is a LOT of money).
If you think $100 is a lot of money, I'm sorry for your current financial situation, I really am.

Harvard + Oxford.
You might not value that, but intelligent people do.

This is 100% bullshit. there's a comparator website, and IR always uses to have the best rates. Maybe they've gone downhill since their CEO died last month.
I shill for Noone. All I've seen in my BTC career are red candles. I just want people to buy BTC so the market gets large enough to overthrow the legacy system. I know that because markets, based on that comparator website, was the 5th or 6th most expensive exchange in Australia @ roughly 7% commission the last time I checked.
As a 27 year old, you should stop acting and speaking like a fucking child, and go get a job or a degree or something, loser. 
Edit: also, learn the difference between "your" and "you're", you fucking ignorant moron.

According to them, they invented facebook. They bought a lot of bitcoin at a price lower than today's - making them some of the very few people who have actually made money off Bitcoin (as opposed to the majority of us who have suffered crippling losses after putting our money where our hearts are over the past 15 months).
But for me, I'm happy enough with them having degrees from Harvard &amp; Oxford and being Olympians - as I've met several remarkable geniuses who were knocked back by both institutions. I've met several supremely talented athletes that have been nowhere near something as great as the Olympics.
The Winklevii hate is born out of jealousy - pure and simple.

In theory, yes. In practice, well, 80% down from ATH and dropping further and further
Seriously ridiculous amounts of money need to enter the ecosystem before this ship is steady enough to use as plan B.
When VC investment hits $5-10bn, that's when it'll be steady enough

The fact that there are Aussie bitcoiners who don't use      boggles meymind.

I'm sorry, but if you can't figure this out for yourself, you have failed in your research.
Go back to the drawing board, read more about how blockchains work, and you'll soon figure out that there is not one social or economic system that is safe from the disruption of bitcoin. Not one.

Price at 18 month lows, getting lower. So, no. Adoption has not increased unfortunately.
