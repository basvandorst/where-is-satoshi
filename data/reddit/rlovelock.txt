Statements like this always confuse me. If you believe in Bitcoin and you've been buying since 2013, how can you justify paying $10k for a coin you once spent around $100 on? Surely you have a pretty sizable stash already if you started investing at such a reasonable rate?  
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:37:23
Did you just double dip the chip?
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:06:17
Can we get a confirmation on this hypothesis? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:10:29
And THC was up 100% before that. Problem is picking which of those coins is going to go on a 100% run before crashing back down again is pretty much entirely luck, especially for people who don't treat it like a full time job.

Usually the two have been within $100 of each other, but since the surge yesterday Xapo has been consistently 500 down.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:49:55
Interesting. Not just another altcoin I see now, thanks for the advice.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:40:07
Xapo never reported higher than 16.5 when coinbase was at 19.5
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:48:46
Any idea what the transfer fees are going to be? Would that be different for each? Xapo/Coinbase/Bittrex?
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:05:25
Should I be worried about the coins I hold with Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:06:25
Yes... no...ye-...yes. No. Maybe?
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:55:05
And there's two of them.

Thanks for the sub!

So... I *shouldnt* drop all my savings into BTC when it hits 12k this afternoon?
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:27:50
Edit: so it sounds to me like it's just luck of the draw where you have your BTC stored?
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:47:59
Ah. 
So we are waiting for the point when there are enough people who believe strongly enough in BTC as a future currency that the value is not negatively effected by these sell offs by others jumping ship.
Instead the coins are just purchased and the value remains unchanged?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:44:48
Me thinks Coinbase is glitching out, hence the crash, hope for a press release, that's a lot of money that potentially changed hands
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:04:57
"So $18, that 19.21 bitcoins, that seems like a good price."

22h later and the guy is still dancing!
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:43:44
And that's great. But at what cost? Now my money can lose 30% of its value in 48 hours because some rich people decide to play around and try to make some profit?
Don't get me wrong, I'm fully on board. Long game. I feel like crypto currency is indeed the future of currency. I've invested everything I could realistically afford to lose but it would still be a pretty devastating hit. 
Is there any reason to believe that the value will become more constant at some point? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:36:47
Seems like yet another system destined to be controlled by the rich and powerful. So what's the point?
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:00:15
Hope today put a smile on your face then!
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:39:39
I sold half my holdings at the 10k-8k dip (my first) to hedge my bets and immediately lost a few hundred bucks when it started to go back up. 
Lesson learned.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:12:35
Damn Mazda! You got sexy!
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:19:41
Can someone explain what this means to a newbie?
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:11:22
Does it also show that every coin up for sale was bought up, preventing the price from dipping due to the "wall of sellers"?

Ya we’ll see if it actually breaks 8500 this time.
Personally I’m a little sick of this 6000-8000-6000-8000 bounce we’ve had the past few months. I’m starting to feel like the market is being manipulated by people just buying and selling in a rhythm ...
@_date: 2018-08-29 10:21:25
I may just take the bullet and sell at 8000, expecting the inevitable drop. With my luck the price will skyrocket and you get all get your Lambos!
@_date: 2018-08-29 09:56:50
Just the sort of thing a market manipulator would say... ;)
@_date: 2019-11-29 11:32:05
What about 2016/2017?

Yeah, but their coins are filled with cheap chocolate... not sure of their longevity...
Don’t know, seriously, didn’t inquire.
@_date: 2019-06-27 14:25:07
I wrote my friend last night when I noticed the $1500 bump, and he replied half an hour later to inform me about the $1500 drop.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:45:43
What a day!

So, if we aren’t making transactions currently, just hodling and forgetting, then there’s no need to transfer to a Segwit wallet, right?
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:46:57
Is it just me or does bitcoin value seem to bottom out between 4-7am PST?
@_date: 2018-07-27 20:50:44
Oh ya... of course! I mean *I* do... but maybe you should tell the people who don’t?
@_date: 2018-12-15 09:19:16
Ya I bought in at 5k and re-upped at 12k, but fuck it.
