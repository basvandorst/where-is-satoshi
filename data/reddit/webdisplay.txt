have to satisfy the full demand for Bitcoin. In other words, if the users of Bitcoin
abandoned their libertarian biases and speculation for the future price of Bitcoin, would
the liquidity be sufficient to serve as a medium of exchange? As I argued in Section 3.4, a 
failure of Bitcoin must mean that something would replace it. In other words, to answer
this question, the status of the competition of Bitcoin is at least as important (if not 
more), than the status of Bitcoin itself.


in transaction costs over other currencies to the extent that it outweighs their advantage
in liquidity, it will sustain itself.

As a non bitcoin expert, the following scenario is easy to understand for me, that's
why it's easy to be a pro-blocksize increase. I want to understand why this is not possible, or is this just too optimistic?


simply because they have a stake, they want to help, they want to secure the network
they want the price of bitcoin to increase. This is how decentralization will be achieved 
from the point of view of pro-blocksize increase. Take Tor or Bittorrent for example.

@_date: 2015-06-22 04:37:24
I get what you mean, but consider this.
1. Gain control of poolserver.
2. Infect clients with malware to prevent switching.
(yes, this is temporary but it will prolong the attack.)
3. Do some nasty things.
4. Collect profit from shorting bitcoin.
5. Enjoy profit.
6. Repeat from step 1.
That is a possible scenario if the attacker only needs 1 or 2 poolserver. 
The ideal solution is to make the attacker infiltrate hundreds of nodes, instead of just 1 or 2.

@_date: 2015-06-28 00:35:14


of blockchain space there is no reason to think that transaction fees
won't fall to the marginal cost of including a transaction, which
doesn't leave anything to pay for proof-of-work security. A proposal
meeting this criteria will have to be clever if you don't keep the
blocksize sufficiently limited that transaction fees are non-negligable.
One possible approach - if probably politically non-viable - would be to
change the inflation schedule so that the currency is inflated
for context.
bitcoin is a marathon, agreed. but if you run too slowly, you still lose. Halving brings scarcity, scarcity brings speculators, speculators pushes the price, the price brings miners, miners brings security, security brings users.

Yes, not yet happening, but we cannot deny that number of transaction and block size are increasing. 
Two things will either happen when we reach blocksize limit; Inconvenience or nothing significant.
Either way, those who experience inconvenience will tolerate it because they know it's just temporary.
That propose solution is actually, Plan A: Lightning Network. Plan B: Blocksize increase. But instead of having to debate Plan B, it's in the code.

obviates the burning "need" for a schedule into the far future rising
to 8GB with unrealistic bandwidth growth assumptions that will surely
cause centralisation problems.


off size bump with policy limits and then re-evaluate after we've seen
what lightning can do.
Can we have the following changes on BIP101 based on Adam's comment?
* Instead of Jan. 1, 2016 make it July 1, 2017. Two years from now.
* Instead of doubling every two years, just a one-time 8mb increase.
Crash landing. What we are really afraid of is that people will replace
bitcoin with another cryptocoin because it doesn't scale, but if people 
are aware that a solution will take effect on a certain date, and more 
importantly, that the community can agree on something, they will stay.
Transaction fee. If bitcoin's price rose 10 times, the stress test 
transactions will no longer be a one day event but a daily occurence. 
It's easy to see that on the transaction trend. Confirmation time will
increase, Tx fee will increase, but again people will tolerate this
because there is a solution in place. The code will keep its promise.
Another thing, at this point there will be two types of user who will
not care about transaction fee.
* Early investor. 
The 2-5 million people who bought bitcoin before the 'moon'.
They will start buying stuff, because essentially all the things that
they will get is 'free'. If you're getting free things, you shouldn't care
about Tx fee. 
* Incoming investor. 
They believe in bitcoin, they know about the solution 
in place. They just want some, they will not care about Tx fee in 
moving their bitcoin from exchanges to their wallet.
Lets test 8MB first? There is no need for that now, we could
do that later, we have two years. Also, those who are advocating 
for the test are also saying LN can solve scalability. They have
two years to prove it, if it did, they can propose to remove

think about it, what you are asking is a central authority to a decentralize system
the strength of bitcoin essentially boils down to the intelligence of every miner, it needs each miner to scrutinize every major update of bitcoin core. If satoshi is not anonymous, there will be those who will follow him blindy. his words will become a single point of failure for bitcoin.

That is not plausible in this case. 
The address already has several transactions starting from January of this year.
Someone knows the private key of that address, no need to brute force a password.
OP mentioned that the App generated the same address twice, it's possible that the App is compromised or the phone itself.

throughput can increase, and there is a technical process that is
effectively working on it.  While people may not all understand the
trade-offs and decentralisation work that should happen in parallel,
nor the Lightning protocol's expected properties - they can appreciate
perceived progress and an evidently functioning process.  Kind of a
weak rationale, from a purely technical perspective, but it may some
value, and is certainly less risky than a unilateral fork.

snippet from the actual report, notice that theres no mention of negative impact.
**Shift 16: Bitcoin and the Blockchain**
The tipping point: 10% of global gross domestic product (GDP) stored on blockchain technology
Expected date: 2027
By 2025: 58% of respondents expected this tipping point to have occurred
Bitcoin and digital currencies are based on the idea of a distributed trust mechanism called the “blockchain”, a way of
keeping track of trusted transactions in a distributed fashion. Currently, the total worth of bitcoin in the blockchain is around
$20 billion, or about 0.025% of global GDP of around $80 trillion.
**Positive impacts**
– Increased financial inclusion in emerging markets, as financial services on the blockchain gain critical mass
– Disintermediation of financial institutions, as new services and value exchanges are created directly on the blockchain
– An explosion in tradable assets, as all kinds of value exchange can be hosted on the blockchain
– Better property records in emerging markets, and the ability to make everything a tradable asset
– Contacts and legal services increasingly tied to code linked to the blockchain, to be used as unbreakable escrow or
programmatically designed smart contracts
– Increased transparency, as the blockchain is essentially a global ledger storing all transactions
The shift in action
Smartcontracts.com provides programmable contracts that do payouts between two parties once certain criteria have
been met, without involving a middleman. These contracts are secured in the blockchain as “self-executing contractual states”, which eliminate the risk of relying on others to follow through on their commitments.
