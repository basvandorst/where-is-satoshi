Yes and yes. This is one of the primary reasons for using bitcoin, as opposed to US-based credit card processors. To avoid the regulatory hassle of any one specific country, and to stand as an **international** crowd-funding platform. 
Right now, my focus is on building something cool and engaging, and didn't plan to ignore regulation entirely. If in time, it becomes legal in the US, then perhaps the site could accept U.S. credit cards as well.

Yep I'm currently alone in my efforts. The main reason, is because I work full time, and don't have the startup cash to quit my job and hire a team for this. Then again, that's one of the problems that this site is trying to solve.
Hopefully, I'll be my site's first successful client, if people like it.
I will email your CO about this, I need all the advice/help I can get. Thanks!

Thanks! 
Funder safety was a big concern when I first started thinking about the site. So far, I've come up with [5 safety measures]( to make sure the creator is safe. I'm still open to more ideas though. Fraud is pretty tough to prevent; look how far enron got. But its still a battle worth fighting.
I've gotten a good amount of feedback against the dark UI so far. I wanted to do it to differentiate it from the vast majority of plain white sites out there, and because it saves energy consumption on LED displays. I'm thinking about switching back to white though.

Yet another one, haha. What are the other ones?

Also, all data is displayed in any of 20 currencies, using the Bitcoinaverage API.

Thanks for the feedback!
I checked out those projects, and they look really promising.
From what I could gather, mypowers looks like a platform to create custom coins. It looks interesting.
Lighthouse looks especially promising too, but fundamentally different from Bitpieces in the same way kickstarter is fundamentally different from Bitpieces.
For both lighthouse and kickstarter, it appears to be about making a pledge, and meeting a specified goal, then providing a product or delivering on a promise to their funders.
A creator on bitpieces has no specific funding goal, which once met, they provide a product, like kickstarter. 
Instead they sell pieces of their brand, each piece entitling their funders to monetary rewards over time, which automatically grow in their funders accounts, and can be withdrawn anytime. 
If a creator sells all of their pieces, and want to raise more money, they can simply issue more pieces.
Log on to the site and let me know what you think.

Oops, good catch. This is fixed now. Thanks!
