Problem is that Ethereum has two nice high-level language called Solidity, and Serpent, which compile down to op-codes. And the clients interact with an javascript based API (which they've decided to call web3; no hubris there-- ethereum is web 3.0!) 
Step out of the technical box for a moment and ask a question; What are hipster developers going to want to develop smart contracts on? Raw op-codes or solidity? 
It took Mike Hearn 6 months to write lighthouse, and it took Vitalik 6 minutes to implement it in serpent.  
When we in the VC community think about platform ecosystems, development tools are first and foremost.  Successful innovation and adoption is more likely to occur if there are low barriers (technical and otherwise) to entry for developers and users.
A scenario where a less technically secure blockchain beats out bitcoin *is* possible, and the reason it would occur is because of easy development tools.   In fact, Ethereum could have some consensus failure in the future and just fix it.  If the community is large enough, they'll just carry on as usual. Bitcoin had 3 bad forks, I suspect Ethereum will have a few as well before they hit Serenity.
Just something to think about...
And one more thing; we have all hedged our bets and hold BTC + ETH.  I'd be very happy to see Bitcoin catch up on the smart contract side of things with sidechains. (i'm guessing a sidechain with smart contracts would very quickly absorb 50% of the BTC and become the new main chain.)

It's open source -- someone else will just update the code and keep developing it.

I think there is a process for having reddit admins remove the mods. 
We need to start contacting reddit admins and tell them that the mods no longer represent the community.
@_date: 2015-08-04 07:17:15
Not only do they take POS seriously, but ethereum will be implementing it with 1 second blocks. 
**IF** they are successful, Bitcoin is going to look antiquated and outdated with 10 minute PoW blocks.  (Not to mention that it's missing a turing complete scripting engine)
Of course, if they successfully implement it you'll also never know about it.  mods have banned Ethereum stories.   You'll notice the price crashing though, and nobody in this sub will ever know the reason why.
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:31:50
XT'ers are going to be butt hurt about this one.
@_date: 2015-08-11 19:00:22
Looks awesome.
I love how they will have smart contracts that will be able to use Bitcoin as payment.  No need to buy Ethers!!  This is a perfect example of why Ethereum is a complement to Bitcoin, not a competitor.
@_date: 2015-08-15 18:59:57


The size of the program is drastically smaller with loops, saving lots of money in tx fees.  Also, you can't pass data to a bitcoin address that will execute a contract based on that data.
@_date: 2015-07-27 14:01:11
I don't think anyone is arguing for all cryptos.  Only ones that are a serious threat, like Ethereum, are worth a discussion.  By the way, Ethereum makes issuing new coins as simple as clicking a GUI and handles tokens natively.  Not surprised a Bitcoin color coin company would be worried about it.

This statement alone should have you removed as a mod.  It's completely legitimate for Bitcoin companies to post articles here and have the community decide whether or not they want to upvote it.
@_date: 2015-07-27 14:15:14
Not arguing the mob nor censorship. On-topic articles shouldn't be removed.  If there is a debate whether something is on-topic, well , then tie should go to the runner.
@_date: 2015-08-13 15:46:28
Instead of debating on which opcodes to add and debate about it over the course of years at a time, why don't we just add a turing complete scripting language and not have to deal with any of it?
Ethereum has one, (and its working fine so far).... Maybe the bitcoin devs should at least take a look at it?
@_date: 2015-08-20 01:47:41
I'm surprised that article doesn't mention the standard consipracy theories that {REDACTED} ([redacted]'s VC arm) invested in one of mike's companies (or he used to work for them) and Gavins meeting with the [redacted] in 2011.

We should change the PoW algorithim back to a GPU based one.

170,000 subs here. 4000 subs in Ethereum.  So yes, the data shows that most Bitcoiners don't know about Ethereum.


This is the kind of toxic rhetoric that makes this subreddit such a shit hole.
I'm here saying that we need to improve Bitcoin because there is a legitimate threat to it, and being shouted down and insulted by you. 
If anyone should piss off it's rude assholes like yourself.
@_date: 2015-07-27 05:16:12
Actaully, its a fact.  Intel have the smallest node size fabs in the world.
It's a cold, raw, fact. Just for you. Enjoy!!
@_date: 2015-07-27 12:57:47
Actually, it fits the sub because it discusses bitcoin, belongs to a major publication, and also discusses a potential threat to bitcoin. It does not violate the posted rules.  


I agree.  If Ethereum is a scam, why would IBM and Samsung be forking it into their Internet of Things products?


'crap' is subjective, thats what upvotes and downvotes are for.
@_date: 2015-07-27 13:19:32
It shows you're biased toward censorship and heavy handed deletion of legitimate on-topic posts.
@_date: 2015-07-27 00:07:40
Yes, they have the smallest node size with Intel, nobody else can compete.
@_date: 2015-07-27 11:55:51


Well, this is why I posted it.  If there is a competing technology to Bitcoin that Banks are adopting, we should know about it so we can improve Bitcoin. Why would we ignore it?  The article mentioned Bitcoin 12 times and came from a very highly respected financial publication. 
To me it's clearly on topic, but even that if it was debatable, why don't you err on the side of caution and just let the subreddit downvote it?
@_date: 2015-07-26 19:00:02
It's funny that nobody cares about the fact 21 Inc. will control &gt; 50% of the hashing power.
With Intel building their chips, and consumers running them in devices at $0 electricity cost to 21 Inc, 21 will control the networks.
Edit:  Keep those downvotes coming! Bitcoiners are definetly in denial today.

Counterparty is a meta layer that by design can never work with SPV nodes.
@_date: 2015-07-27 10:42:23
They wouldn't have to, we can just fork the Ethereum Virtual Machine and replace script with it.
@_date: 2015-07-27 12:47:34
When IBM and Samsung fork other altcoins into their products, then you can compare Ethereum to them.


@_date: 2015-07-27 13:23:36
Riiiiighht.....  How about the entire notion that Banks think Ethereum is the only game in town for Blockchain technology (i.e. not bitcoin)?
Off topic right?  It's not like Bitcoin has a blockchain in it... oh, wait a second.
@_date: 2015-07-27 20:36:06
Hey did you buy Ether in the sale also? It would be good if Bitcoin totally ignore it so that Ethereum has time to grow and replace it.  You should help Ethereum by lobbying to ban more posts here.
@_date: 2015-07-27 20:37:17
Yes there are &lt;12 people working on it.  But there would be 0 if it was an 'altcoin pump scam'.
People are taking it seriously, and so should we.
@_date: 2015-07-27 12:09:51


It has a built-in turing complete scripting language.


If people are selling BTC to buy ETH, that means ETH market cap will grow quickly... and then the next natural step is for major exchanges to adding direct FIAT&lt;-&gt;Ether trading.  Your statement is very short sighted.


@_date: 2015-07-27 13:48:42
So this is where I disagree with you.  You think we should let them have free reign to grow for 3 years until they've passed a tipping point of network effect, instead of just improving Bitcoin's scripting language and eliminating that possibility?


We're not following suit!!
Satoshi put a robust scripting language into Bitcoin on day 1, and would have made it turing complete if he could have!!  Unfortunately there were security risks so it was all turned off.  Vitalik has discovered how to implement Satoshi's original vision in a secure way.
Smart contracts were always supposed to be a core part of Bitcoin.  And if we don't do anything about it, Ethereum will replace us.
It's really amazing how much push-back I'm seeing for proposing that we improve Bitcoin's scripting language. Unbelievable. It's like some people purposely want to keep Bitcoin crippled for some reason.... Maybe they're Ether holders!!
@_date: 2015-07-27 13:01:11
Then downvote the post.  But it shouldn't be banned.  That's the discussion we're having here.  The community should decide whether or not Ethereum is a threat and whether or not it should be taken seriously.  There should be no banning of posts by mods that are on-topic because they happen to discuss threats to Bitcoin.  Leave it to the community to decide. Those are the posts we should be taking most seriously and adapting and improving bitcoin to mitigate those threats.  
We need to do whatever we can to make sure that we improve Bitcoin's scripting language so it can stay competitive in the future.
@_date: 2015-07-27 20:42:49
Exactly.  And if you ban another story, we'll just go through this again... and the story will have more exposure than if you mods just let it be downvoted in the first place!
So its better to just leave things alone... this entire post never would have even happened and that article would have been downvoted.  As I said, let the community decide what is up/down voted.
@_date: 2015-07-27 11:47:36
It wasn't deleted, it was removed from visibility. 
@_date: 2015-07-27 14:09:00
Counterparty by design cannot work with SPV nodes, it needs the full block chain.
@_date: 2015-07-27 13:08:25
Do you seriously think you're a good moderator?  Just because something is reported by some users as being off topic, *doesn't mean its actually off topic.*  There are 170,000 subscribers here. 1 person reports as off topic and you think you should remove it?
@_date: 2015-07-27 13:18:19


So, when the market cap is bigger then Bitcoin is that when it's proven itself?  That would be too late.  We should be pro-active in dealing with threats so that Bitcoin can beat Ethereum and win in the long run.   IBM and Samsung have forked it into their IoT products, I think its legitimate enough to take seriously.
@_date: 2015-07-30 23:27:09
What's it like being a MOD that's downvoted for censorship?
This entire thread is the community saying they don't want Ethereum posts banned.  Yet you do it anyway.
What are you going to do when major newspapers start prining Etheruem posts that have Bitcoin in them as well? Ban those too, even if they're on topic?
@_date: 2015-07-27 13:11:10
The post isn't spam.  It was published in the International Business Times.  What's next?  Wall Street Journal articles that mention Bitcoin and Ethereum in the same article are spam also?
I don't want to pump Ethereum.  I want Bitcoin to improve it's scripting language.  This is a legitimate and honest discussion that the community needs to have.  Ethereum is not a 'scam pump altcoin'.  It's a serious endeavor that IBM and Samgsung have built into their products.  Why would you want to ignore it?  Perhaps you bought Ethers and don't want Bitcoin to improve itself so that Ethereum can beat it????
I'm standing here saying we should improve Bitcoin, and you're saying I'm spamming an altcoin. How does that make any sense???
I'm not sure how much clearer I can make that.
@_date: 2015-07-27 23:34:42
Monero doesn't have mainstream coverage in IBT , wall st journal, etc. Ethereum does.
@_date: 2015-07-27 12:36:11
If some of the community thinks something is on-topic, and some thinks its off-topic, it should be up to the community to decide whether or not its up or downvoted.  Thats what the voting process is there for.  Your response to those people should be 'feel free to downvote it if you think its not contributing to the subreddit in any way'.
@_date: 2015-07-27 13:55:49
That's your response?  The trillion dollar financial industry is looking seriously at Ethereum's Blockchain technology.  IBM and Samgsun have integrated it in their products, and you're saying we shouldn't care?  That it's not relevant?
@_date: 2015-07-27 12:21:30


Rule  "News articles that do not contain the word "Bitcoin" are usually off-topic."
CTRL-F: The article contained the word 'Bitcoin' 12 times.  It's on-topic.  
@_date: 2015-07-27 12:40:45
How is this any different than the the pundits saying 'Bitcoin is just a ponzi pump'?.  Bitcoin deserves to be taken seriously, and so does Ethereum.  We shouldn't be stupid like the people who wrote all the Bitcoin Obituaries in the past few years.  If something deserves honest attention as a potential threat we shouldn't hand wave it away. IBM and Samsung have put Ethereum into their IoT products and banks are taking it seriously.  It's not a run of the mill altcoin pump. We should take it seriously and start having a discussion with the Core devs to improve Bitcoin's scripting language.

@_date: 2015-07-27 14:36:02
No, I'm judging it based on dicussion.  Discussion seems to indicate that the community believes mods should not be heavy handed and err on the side of caution when they're not absolutely sure that something is off-topic.
@_date: 2015-07-27 13:05:05
Well then I'd say Rule 4 should be revised... It's too open to interpretation whether or not something should be allowed.  Sometimes a post can be 'mostly' about another cryptocurrency but still belong in this sub. Let the community decide.
@_date: 2015-07-27 14:04:21
Yes, it is. And it's relevant to @_date: 2015-07-27 14:13:05
And your best judgement was wrong.
Stop censoring articles that are on-topic and let the community vote on them.
@_date: 2015-07-27 12:23:07
So, you want to ignore a technology that banks are taking seriously that might end up competing with Bitcoin?  Rather then discussing it and improving Bitcoin to eliminate the threat?
This isn't some random altcoin forum post pump, it's the International Business Times.  IBM and Samsung have forked Ethereum into their Internet-of-things products. We should be taking this seriously.
@_date: 2015-07-27 13:58:17
And I'm being upvoted for it. Front page news my friend; the community agrees with me.
@_date: 2015-07-27 13:09:33
And when the Rule of Law is harmful?
@_date: 2015-07-27 11:36:38
Sure, but Ethers are also tokens as well (like Bitcoin) and can become digital gold if enough people use them.  Ignoring potential threats with hand-wavy statements doesn't make them go away...  The intelligent thing for us to do as a community is to have a serious debate as to how real the threat is, and take action if necessary.  If this is really what banks are saying about Ethereum -- I think its time we start having a discussion about making Bitcoin's script turing complete.
@_date: 2015-07-27 14:37:29
Those new coins weren't natively handled in all the other wallets.  They are on ethereum.
@_date: 2015-07-27 14:10:40
That's incorrect.  Satoshi's original vision was to have a robust scripting language.  It got turned off because it was insecure, but Ethereum has managed to fix that.
They're implementing Satoshi's vision, and you're not.  
The only explanation as to why you wouldn't want Bitcoin to improve, is that you bought Ether in the sale and don't want Bitcoin to compete with it to help your Ether investment.  I know what you're all about now.
@_date: 2015-07-27 13:03:29
This is a fair argument.   What do you think is a good point at which we should take it seriously?  After it runs successfully for a year, or when it hits a $500M market cap?  FYI their testnet has been running for 6 months and just passed 1 million blocks.   All I'm saying is lets be smart about this and start the discussion with the Core devs around thinking about implementing a turing complete scripting language.  Lets make sure that we do whatever is needed so that Bitcoin wins in the long run.
@_date: 2015-07-30 21:56:06
As a bitcoiner I want to know about other blockchains that have successfully implemented smart contracts.  
You are stifling debate and censoring the subreddit.
You've been voted down as well.  Users want to see Ethereum stories.
