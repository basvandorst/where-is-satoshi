But to pay their employees in btc there would be another $20 fee. Even if that is only 20 employees that is 400 dollars in costs to pay your employees. Just silly

But the nodes under lightning are more easily regulated and of they can even just take out a large group of them it will increase centralization in the network.

If you can't admit bitcoin has a big problem right now with transaction fees and time, then you're ignorant. I believe in the coin, but the ability of btc to be useful right now? Just sucks. And dont come at me with store of value. If you want mass adoption and not just another place for banks to put their (really your) money then you need fast cheap transacitons for everyone. So even if all bch does is expose a weakness btc needs to work on so that it does it faster bch is doing a service, although i believe it will do more than that.

This is really though. Its sad cause tons of people lose money doing this. If people would just watch themselves, we could all make a lot more money, and build the community much faster.
