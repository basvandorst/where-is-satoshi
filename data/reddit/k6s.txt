licences, fingerprints, ids.. Do you want my dna and my mensurations also ? Your justifications so far are terrorism and money laudering. Well, HSBC is doing just fine regarding money laudering. That's obvious you don't need bitcoins at all. Terrorism ? Stop invading, stealing, bring war and enslaving people, and they will stop considering turning themselves into human bombs and killing as much innocent people as possible as a cool thing to do. Total lack of education and disgusting standards of living can turn you crazy. US foreign policies is the main source of unsecurity for the us people.
In an other hand those abusive reglementations will, as it have been many times points out, kill creativity and small businnesses. You will create monopoles and once again, the people will pay the price.
I do think governement need a way to tax, because it's supposed to built hospitals, schools, keep our cities clean... But that could be achieve without compromising the original spirit of the bitcoins. Why not have a money transaction fee ? Oh well, it's already implemented rigth ? That could become an easy and effective way to tax financial transactions and keep the insane financial markets habits who poses such a threat to the economy out of the bitcoin system, and in the same time be a remarquably fair tax. You could also imagine crypto moneys who devaluates when they are not used, forcing the owners to invests it in the real world economy and  thus create true wealth. And these just came out of my mind, I'm shure it's flawed and you could find way better. Which bring me to my last point : code is law, not your deprecated shitty pieces of paper.
Be creative, have balls, serve your people instead of robbing them and you will find in cryptocurrencies and awesome way to start fixing the sick world we live into. Dont and the people will have to find other way of governance.
