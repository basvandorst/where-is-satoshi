For a while I legit just thought I was an idiot, and after a while I realised I was one as I was on the wrong sub ahaha �� 
It's so petty that they've hijacked the name. Why don't they use r/bch?

Is this only for when people change their crypto back to fiat currency?

percentages for what?

Is this why the prices are dropping so much?
@_date: 2019-07-21 10:36:15
Yet on reddit it's the opposite. So frustrating. I was subbed to r/btc for over a year really confused

Peeps asked what?

At its current trajectory, how long will it take before 100% is in circulation?
@_date: 2019-07-31 20:47:47
How come it only took 10 years to mine the first 85%?

I agree. Everybody knows that pigeons hate cryptocurrency

Can I ask - I have some bitcoin but on the etoro platform, I want to purchase some so I actually personally hold it. Which site would you recommend? Do I need a wallet?

Don't talk about it, simple. You don't need other peoples validation on what you invest your money into

Pm'd you dude, need help

Nice work! Are you still dollar cost averaging, or just holding what you have for now?
@_date: 2019-10-18 16:04:45
Nice, man. Just curious, but how did you know when the right time to sell was, in late 2017? I remember it falling off really really fast, did you manage to sell right at the top, or was it slightly before/after?

Far too early
@_date: 2019-10-23 19:55:07
me too
@_date: 2019-06-25 15:23:54
so they've just hijacked r/btc?
@_date: 2019-06-25 14:36:37
Can somebody please tell me, it r/btc just a bitcoin cash subreddit, and r/bitcoin the real bitcoin sub? It's so confusing to me as somebody who doesn't frequent either
