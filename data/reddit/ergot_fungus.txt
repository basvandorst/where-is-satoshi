100% in crypto, don't sell until you're a millionaire

I've been saying the same thing actually. Finally someone who agrees

My understanding is that Legacy addresses are vulnerable to quantum attacks. Also, any address that has ever SENT Bitcoin is vulnerable to quantum attacks. Quantum computing technology won't get there for a long time but you won't know when it's there until it starts happening. It shouldn't be something you're paranoid about, but you should keep your funds as safe as humanly possible.

I don't know, but never sell all your bitcoin. Keep at the very least 10% in bitcoin or if you sell all make sure you have a buyback plan

Thanks man, I appreciate that. Sorry for acting dickish lol. I feel like hot shit because with these prices, continued investment, and altcoins popping off I have 10x more Bitcoin than I did 6 months ago, I'm really hyped haha especially since I have gone all in on crypto

My target has been 4.9k for 150 days now, I think we are gonna get it.

You wish lol. Nah, I've already changed my life with altcoins. (After getting out of btc at 13k because this downtrend was obvious from the moment we crashed from 14k)
@_date: 2019-11-22 21:41:03
Doesn't matter to me... I got out around 13k. It's shitcoin time baby
@_date: 2019-11-26 09:00:20
I tripled my money with altcoins what's up? Bitcoin moon yet???
@_date: 2019-10-09 21:10:16
I'm assuming you went short before every short squeeze, then went long before the dump?

Be thankful you didn't lose more. I've lost 1 entire bitcoin trading shitcoins. (I've revised my strategy and I'm working towards earning it back)

As a trader, I agree with you. However, most people know that 90% of traders are net negative. History proves that HODL is a winning strategy

try 5k

If you sell your bitcoin when the fiat price is high, and then buy it back when the price is low, you can get more bitcoin
@_date: 2019-12-07 11:36:37
If you don't know what you're doing then you should go ahead and withdraw that money
