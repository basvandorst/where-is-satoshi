Doesn't matter. It's all about market confidence, and long term possibility of paying off. Remember, it wouldn't have mattered if they chose a price lower since they would just have ended up paying huge dividends to short-sellers. They run a zero-sum market on their margin trading. 
If Bitcoin jumped to $900, shorts would have lost a TON, but on the flipside (in a roughly 50/50 leverage scenario) the longs would have gained a TON. 
They have no financial incentive to be unfair.

I was in a margin long position in BTC/USD. That position should have been locked 100% but apparently they decide that I should pay for other BTC losses, but those who held USD or other crypto do not? Fuck that noise. I'll rather sue them.

I don't think he could entirely avoid prosecution. I wouldn't even bother with a lawyer. I would set up a secure conference and deal 100% under the table, and offer them enough money back that they call off the 'dogs' so to speak and then disappear. 
Law enforcement is less scary than bounty hunters when you sit on $60 million that belongs to some of the brighter and more well connected people in the crypto space.

Sure he can. But he can also alleviate a lot of bounties, and concerns by returning a share of it. 
$70 million is a TON of money. If all he wants if a comfortable sum, returning $50 million would cool down a lot of the worst frenzy.

THe problem with margin trading is that it doesn't work that way. If I open a long position, I do so with (possibly) an individualized account balance as equity. 
From there of course I borrow Bitcoin to cover my position, that bitcoin comes from a pool of margin lenders. 
Then to make it even more convoluted the other side, or short players are doing the same. 
Add to that the fact that the hacker seems to have bypassed withdrawal features and been able to withdraw funds that even in the internal system should have been collateral locked and you have one more 'well fuck' situation.
Basically you end up with a system where nothing is in reality individualized since most transactions span 3-5 accounts or more.
In short. Even though balances may have been 'unique' at some point. There is simply no way of even starting to figure out where one account starts and another begins when you mix in lending, margin and interest. 
I also don't see how $1k per coin is a valid argument. They are settling the deals at a point in time where users still had access to their accounts and could withdraw, make trades etc. 
Anyone who is in a position post-hack, was in the same position at 18.00 UTC. 
I consider it the most fair solution to a damn disaster.

I tend to agree (lost 250 btc). But I would also argue that it's a far less invasive solution than the hard fork that Ethereum wen't through, and actually something that is unique to proof of work. 
Going to be interesting to see how this pans out.

In short. No. 
To be able to even start to calculate their liabilities and assets they have to do something and the most correct way is to roll back the clock (so to speak), to the last time when customers could still performed informed decisions. 
Does it suck to not make 50% on your short position? Yeah, it does. But in a world without the hack, there is no guarantee you wouldn't have lost money on it. 
Is it awesome to possibly not go broke on a long position? Yeah. But same there. Without a hack, there is nothing that says price would have fallen.
There is simply put no more 'fair' way of handling it, even though it potentially costs Bitfinex a lot of extra money. 
I also believe that if they are to get through this, the ONLY way to do so is to handle everything in whatever way is preferred by the legal system, financial system etc. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:58:25
Well, first of all I would argue that stealing from a darknet market carries almost zero legal liabilities, and once you operate on the dark net you are already protected to a very high extent. 
Secondly I would not put it past the person or persons behind the evolution market theft to have set up the market with an exit scam in mind. Giving them ample time to make sure that everything was  100% air tight.
At the end of the day it's really unlikely that you manage to pull off the Bitfinex hack without leaving any trace what so ever. And if paying 50% or so of $70 million to cool down the search efforts even a little bit, that might be Bitcoin well spent.
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:43:46
Of course it's possible he didn't. We know absolutely nothing as of now. 
For all we know the hacker is a 17 year old Anonymous supporter in his moms basement that thought he would steal a few 100 BTC, and is crying right now realizing his script worked better than anticipated.
If history has taught us anything it is that NO ONE is Jason Bourne. Look at the hackers we have had so far. The ineptitude for even rudimentary infosec or covering their tracks makes your head spin.
Literally the only ones that hasn't been caught are people exit scamming on the darknet, and that's likely more because law enforcement doesn't give a shit about a few thousand BTC stolen from potheads than anything.

"What is it with every woman lately uses that to try to offend males?! Ohh GET A JOB, OOH MOVE OUT OF YOUR MOMS HOUSE, OOOH LIVING IN THE BASEMENT. Do women say stuff like that because their kids are like that and they assume everyone else is too?"
I guess someone forgot to take their medication for quite some time. 
I also wonder if you have any form of awareness of the last 10 hacks and large bitcoin scandals since you seem to think that Charlie Shrem, Ross Ulbricht, Big Vern just to name a few were anything but exactly what I am describing. Former sysadmins and engineers with limited social skills and completely outmatched by even a corrypt FBI agent and a few accountants with the ability to use google.
And as far as law enforcement you also seem to have completely missed the bus on the fact that they treat any form of large theft in the same way. Or do you think they just don't investigate the disappearance of $80 million worth of art cause 'they don't give a shit about picazzo'?
Damn dude, you need to up your dosage. And maybe also, move out of your moms basement.

@_date: 2016-08-04 01:35:03
I would argue that you assume that the hacker is basically Jason Bourne, and not a bored 19 year old Anonymous fan in his moms basement in Wisconsin. 
It's entirely possible he is in WAY over his head, not for a second realizing the shitstorm he got himself into. 
Look at Ross and the other 'criminal masterminds' that got caught. Almost comically clueless as to what they were doing, and how vastly they were underestimating even law enforcement several years ago.
I don't even want to speculate in the data that a well motivated NSA/FBI task force can dig up without you as a hacker having a clue of what you might have left behind. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:27:08
They aren't forcing shorts to do anything that wouldn't have naturally have happened had price remained the same as it was at point of failure. They are just not handing them free money, and killing every long position.

What is your argument? They are most likely taking massive losses rolling trades back to a time when users had account access. 
Are you arguing that it would be 'more fair' to just reopen and let whoever was lucky enough to have a short cash out at the expense of all the margin long positions that get liquidated due to a situation that was created by the hack?
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:14:35
Except you know, for all the times they have. And have paid out of pocket for it.
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:42:04
They wont stick to the individualized account defense, simply because it makes no sense. 
If they are to calculate every trade for any extended period of time and treat accounts as unique with all the cross balances, loans, margins etc. they die. 
If they stay closed for a month. They die. 
Their ONLY chance is to reopen for 'inspection' as fast as possible. Settle positions and come out with a solution in the next few days. 
Otherwise, 'individual accounts' or not. Everyone loses. 
Cause I can guarantee that if they go insolvent, all their funds will be pooled and everyone can start filing claims they won't be able to settle.
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:49:36
You don't even need a stolen identity. You can spread your shorts across any number of exchanges that require only email and password (and fake name) to register and trade in crypto. 
Poloniex for example have NO deposit or trade limits on 100% anonymous accounts. Just a daily withdrawal limit of $7k. 
And Chinese exchanges are even more laxed. 
Its a zero risk game to take positions. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 02:55:06
Because simply if everyone else withdraws all their funds in fear of lawsuits, and the users carrying losses sue them, it's game over. 
You seem to miss that their only chance of recovery is volume from trading. Without that, they are just a shell with massive overhead and a terrible reputation. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:47:06
If you are under the impression that it would be hard to raise a few 1000 BTC if you have connections on the darknet and can reasonably prove that you have a working hack for a major exchange, I would say that you are wrong.
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:03:30
Absolutely, but I would argue that the cost of doing business 'the right way' is something they most likely have to swallow to have a chance in hell of getting out from under this.
There is no way an investor, or the public will have any continued faith in them should they rake their customers for an extra 30% just to save $10 mil.
If I were to guess. I think Bitfinex will survive, and they will have 2-3 larger bitcoin whales as large owners taking significant equity as payment for their lost BTC to enable continued operation and long term profit. 
Thats what I would have done had I been the owners of Finex. Reach out to your largest Bitcoin holders and push a deal where the choice is, take equity or gamble on a huge loss. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:29:18
This is actually far more reasonable than I feared. It's a pragmatic and correct approach that freezes time instead of allowing the 'lucky' traders to get away with huge possible profits off of short positions and USD holdings, while killing half their customers. 
I'm sure there will be a lot of whining, but I think this is about as fair as it will get. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:22:46
A 5x increase in shorts across multiple exchanges literally hours before the DAO hack would suggest he did.
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:32:02
Could very well be the case, but I don't think that is guaranteed. The CFTC complaints was regarding their 'off site' handling of funds (not providing on site liquidity) and not the exact account connection (if I am not mistaken). 
Its also irrelevant in a situation where the entire infrastructure is compromised and the entity is facing insolvency.
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:34:03
Won't matter for Bitcoinica though since they owed mostly bitcoin, and not USD.

I doubt it would 'ruin' bitcoin but I think it would be detrimental.
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:27:21
And from what I understand that is very close to what they are doing. They are rolling back to a point in time when people had account access, and could have closed their positions. 
I can't think of a more fair time to choose than as close to the hack as possible. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:15:58
Your argument is just terrible. They are rolling trades back to a point in time when you had account access still. 
Is your argument that you should be able to make money off of positions that became profitable through the crash created by the hack? 
Cause that argument is fucking retarded, mostly because when you are in a margin position you aren't trading with 'your' coin anymore so there is no 'individualized account'. You are using your account as collateral. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:26:12
I'm fairly certain they are taking advice of the best legal councel they can find, and not 'wildly guessing' at all. Hopefully this is part of a larger structured deal where they can cover the losses. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:53:44
He wouldn't have to. Financial recovery deals are made all the time, and there are many ways of setting up a proof-of-funds process, smart contract release etc. that is dependent on certain terms. 
No, law enforcement wouldn't just say 'you are free to go'. But it could easy the pressure considerably if Bitfinex backed off, and stopped paying the worlds best blockchain analytics, not put a bounty on him etc. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:14:04
If the hacker isn't a complete idiot (which is unlikely considering the sophistication of the event). He most likely also made a CONSIDERABLE sum shorting before the hack. 
Keeping $10 million, or even $20 and returning the rest might be the smartest thing he can do. A $80 million manhunt can get pretty scary no matter how well prepared you are. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 12:57:15
So many people here that have ZERO experience running business or even wildly ballparking the costs to do so. Please don't start a company.

I do. It blows absolute ass. But I do.
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:22:30
If I owned Bitfinex and was facing insolvency this is what I would do.
I would contact the top 20 accounts that suffered heavy losses and fly them 'wherever' for a sit down. 
I would explain the situation, and lay out that if we tried to repay the full $70 million, Bitfinex would be insolvent and court costs will cause the payback of their assets to be a fraction of original account balances. 
Then I would present an alternative. 
I would ask the whales to trade their currently possibly worthless bitcoin balances for equity in Bitfinex. I would give them equity at a rate that makes it impossible to say no, facing a 90% loss of deposited funds. 
The whales, maybe representing 30-60% of the loss from the hack would yell at me, but at the end of the day say yes and trade their positions for equity. 
Now I am facing a $25-$40 million loss, of which $10 or so is covered by Bitfinex fiat balances. 
All I need is a $10-$25 million loan or capital infusion and I can survive. With still a chance of catching the hacker, or making him an offer that allows me to pay back the loan and providing an exit for whales in an orderly fashion.
Not saying it happened, just saying its what I would be going after. And I think it would work.
Remember. Bitfinex most likely generates (generated) a damn healthy cash flow in the possibly 2-figure millions over rolling 12-month. If I was facing a total loss, or a possibly lucrative business deal I know what I would do.
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:51:57
That is literally like comparing DNA evidence from 1899 to today. When the MtGox theft took place law enforcement treated bitcoin like a more or less worthless crypto experiment and blockchain analysis didn't exist. Hell, MtGox didn't even keep IP records. 
Now, quite a different story.
Either way if you steal $70 million, it would be a very easy decision to give up 50% or more to at least cool down the feeding frenzy. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:21:51
? Either way it wouldn't matter since generally trading accounts are exempt from FDIC insurance.

@_date: 2016-08-04 01:01:38
Why? Cause he had no idea he would perform the hack, and couldn't plan ahead? 
The margin volume on 2 of the Chinese exchanges is around $250 million per day, every day, 7 days a week. You think that it would be that hard to set say 50.000 BTC of shorts across an exchange or two and go completely unnoticed. 
I can tell you with 100% certainty that if I had been the hacker, I could have done it and not even missed a minute of sleep.
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:12:19
Doesn't matter, but they have to act fast. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:37:55
That's sort of my point. Bitfinex HAS to be the one taking the loss if they are to have any chance of coming back.
The only way out is to remain an entity that carries communal trust, and goodwill. If that means taking a loss to slowly claw back the funds through years of work then so be it. 
If they 'fuck over' their customers they sign their own death sentence. 
The owners know this, their layers know this and anyone looking to possibly save the business through a loan or investment knows this. 
A few extra millions is a cheap price to pay for a chance at redemption.
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:11:26
Assuming a relatively even margin market, the shorts simply cross the longs. And Bitfinex will have to eat the loss on long overage.
Sure there might not be funds for either, but at least it gives a debt calculation at a point in time where users still had account access. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 04:10:06
I had a margin long position so I was in USD, not BTC even if the underlying collateral was BTC. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 04:12:57
I'll definitely sue if losses are socialized only across BTC accounts. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:47:01
Not sure who 'they' would be. But I'm sure there are people in the bitcoin community that would feed him his own eyeballs for 120,000 BTC rather than leading him to the cops and collecting their lost 2500 BTC.
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:11:43
I disagree somewhat. It requires widespread adoption of the temporary action, and is unlikely to set any form of precedent. It also ironically encourages better hashrate distribution to ensure a malicious rollback does not happen.
I'm not saying it's great, but it's far better than a hard fork (ETH style).
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:46:09

Well, since there is ZERO motivation for a hacker not to take positions before the hack. You can probably draw your own conclusions.

They are a well funded bank that allows crypto purchases. Why would they cryptographically prove anything when it means nothing? Crypto proof is useful if you are an all-crypto exchange. Circle and Coinbase are FIAT heavy banks.
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:35:27
I think the market will appriciate a well laid plan. IF the outcome is that Bitfinex owes their customers $10-$40 million in IOU's that they might actually be able to pay off, we might even see some form of a rally.
The WORST CASE. Scenario would be a Gox situation where they go 'Well, you all fucked' and just close their doors.

Socialized losses should always be across all assets or not at all.
@_date: 2016-08-01 22:52:08
Mostly because they have no responsibility to carry 100% coverage of all crypto since they can themselves hedge. They may or may not have 100% solvency in crypto, but if they aren't idiots, they could also carry some crypto risk in hedges through other exhcanges etc. They have a ton of FIAT.

But since they aren't deposit boxes, that's a moot argument.

They know that they are liable, that's why they aren't running to the individualized account defense. Once it became clear that it wasn't BitGo's fault, that option died.

@_date: 2016-06-28 02:25:52
Has worked just fine for 10.000's of people with CEX, Genesis Mining and Hashnest for several years. Just don't fall for bad scams.

ieoz8 I assume is your real name? Dumbass.
@_date: 2016-06-30 19:27:44
I think you might be a little 'touched' if you think that there aren't legitimate competitors to Bitcoin based on the fact that bitcoin isn't evolving.
@_date: 2016-06-28 02:10:01
Did you grammar?
@_date: 2016-06-29 12:21:32
Why? Cause you say so? Fuck that.
@_date: 2016-06-28 02:19:57
Only idiots draws conclusions regarding all business because there has been many scams. Bitmain has been running their cloud mining for years without scamming anyone. Don't go with companies that are fly by night shitholes and you can mine just fine.

1. Miners ARE the network, unless you think bitcoin propagates transactions though magical fairies flying data across the globe. 2. If you are a holder, and fight against miners interest, you are literally a damn retard. 3. Of course miners will fight for more transactions, that's the entire point of mining, and the ONLY thing that will keep the network alive after the mining reward is gone and the ONLY incentive miners have to mine. How is this something you missed? 4. Just sell your bitcoin and invest in onecoin instead. There you have a board of scammers making decisions. You obviously don't understand how bitcoin works.

Not because blocks are full or transaction fees are rising faster than software can keep up with. STOP THE FUD!

I actually managed to do really well. 'felt' like $800 was too high, got out at 770, and back in today (not at lowest point but $600 flat) so I'm happy.
@_date: 2016-06-28 02:21:48
How much they circulated means absolutely nothing. Their numbers were all fake, and so was 90% of their customers. 
@_date: 2016-06-28 02:08:51
Not like shapeshift is much better. 
@_date: 2016-06-28 02:23:10
If you think someone runs a scam and uses their own name on anything, then you need medication.
@_date: 2016-06-29 12:26:57
It's getting ridiculous to claim that 'it's spam' when the median size is over/at 900k
@_date: 2016-06-30 23:11:38
I haven't seen any issues in over 6 months, and even those were minor, and reimbursed by them.
@_date: 2016-06-29 01:05:03
I know. Mark Karpeles at least looks like a Carp. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 23:41:21
Every day son! Every day..
@_date: 2016-06-24 11:09:21
Yes I do. Was reeeeeeeeally high..
@_date: 2016-06-28 02:05:54
Ain't nobody got time to be scammed by your nickle and dime operation.
@_date: 2016-06-28 02:13:13
20 minutes? Sure.
@_date: 2016-06-30 22:24:46
1. They are the absolute biggest wallet, and it's not even close. 2. I assume you are not talking about user friendly web wallets, cause they are clearly the most function packed of them. 3. Not secure? Show me another wallet that has reimbursed EVERY person that has reported an actual bug and lost bitcoin. You own your keys, 2-factor in all forms, multi signature etc. Closest wallet is probably circle or coinbase that are NOT wallets cause you don't control your private keys.
@_date: 2016-06-23 23:30:40
My crazy professional trading strategy is to sell when i feel it's high, and buy back later at some point. I just don't stress it. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 23:36:35
Hard fork obviously. /s
@_date: 2016-06-23 23:42:46
He claims he is the hacker, and honestly I don't think it's far fetched. He's an anarko capitalist, he's known for giving zero shits about the law, he hated Ethereum from day 1 (he shorted the ICO) and definitely has the technical chops to carry out the drain. Then again, he's also a world class narcissist and could claim to be the hacker just for teh lulz.
@_date: 2016-06-28 02:05:07
So it's a card that require all the KYC of a bank to be useful, and charges fees that would make Ponzi operators pull their hair out with envy.
@_date: 2016-06-29 01:10:13
Nice, I own one of the 100 BTC bars being held on the back cover. 
@_date: 2016-06-28 02:21:00
Your calculations are a joke. Cloudhashing.com that was the worlds biggest cloud mining operation didn't make $50 million in 2 years. Hashocean is small potatoes, and prob just went bankrupt.
@_date: 2016-06-28 02:11:05
Nooo, really? But he seemed like such a nice guy. 
@_date: 2016-06-24 00:24:04
I think it's quite a bit more. Satoshi's coin + at least another 2 million. Hell I know people that together have lost or burned 200k+
@_date: 2016-06-28 02:24:49
0.00751105 BTC/DAY per MH. If you think that's real I have a bridge for sale. If you are too lazy to do the math, that's 0.75 BTC/GH per day. So an Antminer S7LN would ROI in 9 hours :)
@_date: 2016-06-30 23:11:56
I was joking :)
@_date: 2016-06-23 23:35:35
Cause I laughed so hard i'm gonna need fucking road assistance to get up..
@_date: 2016-06-29 01:05:50
Who cares? The signs of Craptsys demise was there for a solid 15 months before the closure. Cryptsy shares anyone? 
@_date: 2016-06-23 23:35:59
Not too far from Mircea Popescu..
@_date: 2016-07-06 14:29:58
A person that works for coinbase registered "join" as his wallet and is advertising it using their affiliate program. Fixed that for ya. You idiot. 
@_date: 2016-07-06 14:34:42
Why? Just more complicated for everyone. 
@_date: 2016-07-01 12:29:33
Reading? That's for Fiat users. When you deal with bitcoin the bank should only ask for a lock of your hair and trust you. /s
@_date: 2016-07-06 14:24:48
Big blocks IMPROVE Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-07-01 12:07:36
Very reasonable.
@_date: 2016-07-06 14:32:33
The fact that people complain, but don't understand how these laws work is fucking scary. 
@_date: 2016-07-06 14:36:29
If you need a tutorial to learn about futures and margin trading. Then you shouldn't be trading futures or margin. 
@_date: 2016-07-06 14:31:11
Nooooooooooooo! Really? That's news!
@_date: 2016-07-06 14:31:52
Who. The. Fuck. Cares what you do?
@_date: 2016-07-01 12:30:48
If you don't like a service, don't use it. It's really that easy. 
@_date: 2016-07-06 14:34:13
Uh huh, and with the proof you are providing I will immediately assume they are scamming you. 
@_date: 2016-07-06 14:29:09
Oh, another anonymous person hating a service because they allegedly did something he can't prove. How novel, let's upvote like idiots. 
@_date: 2016-07-06 14:30:49
And even if it was. What the hell is the problem with someone working for a company advertising their service? Op is an idiot.
