Still have to give OP credit for figuring out how to take a video of Vitalik talking about quantum computers + bitcoin 3 years ago and weave a story about why you should be indirectly afraid of Ethereum.

Satoshi launched Bitcoin knowing it couldn't scale. Difference is "cant now" vs "cant ever". Scaling public blockchains (true scaling, not costly parameter adjustments) is possible until proven otherwise.

I used to play professionally, and honestly this made me cringe a little. Any real pro would kill to be at that table. The same goes for cryptocurrency. The extent to which the ecosystem is dominated by people unfamiliar with market dynamics creates massive opportunity for savvy investors.

In a dark pool the lights are off and no one can see the order book. In this situation, the lights are off and market makers are given nightvision goggles. Arguably unfair to retail investors, but it will be an attractive proposition to the institutional liquidity providers we are lacking.

That video's logic fails in the context of slavery and civil rights more broadly. The reality is that there's pros/cons to majority rule, just as there is with dictatorship, and everything in between.

It is shocking how many people in this thread are in complete denial of the fact that social dynamics affect cryptoeconomic consensus....
@_date: 2016-03-04 08:14:03
Same as "Internet" vs "The Internet". Only difference is the world has yet to decide which blockchain is "The Blockchain".

Yeah, there really isn't any reliable way to gauge economic sentiment unfortunately.


Call me a radical, but I honestly think both sides would be better off separate. Diversity of opinion is good until it halts all progress.

What metrics are you using? I haven't been able to find any good ones.
@_date: 2017-03-30 16:41:41
Some of this is due to the drama, but it's also just the natural response to Bitcoin (smartly) not trying to be all things to all people.

Isn't this a moot point? Judging by the reasoning giving for denying the prior ETF, it would be impossible for any other ETF to be approved in the near future, regarless of how it is structured.

Technically you're correct in that it is simply a data structure as described in the white paper. In practice, most people refer to a blockchain as synonymous with a "blockchain system" in which the network built around it is included in the definition. And for that, there is an argument that the dominant public blockchain would be referred to as "the blockchain" -- debatable though.

The same way we argue in hindsight that the silk road takedown was more good than bad, we might realize that the inevitable drop in the chinese equity market played a larger role than greece crisis looking back. 
Dont underestimate the portion of bitcoin demand that is speculation, the portion of speculators that are Chinese, and their lack of interest in safe haven assets like bitcoin when their stock market is in a full blown bubble as it had been for the past year.

Last bubble started with unusually heavy buying in the face of seemily bearish news (silk road takedown). Will be interesting to see how this plays out.

Before you raise your pitchfork, think about how the spread of private networks could be a trojan horse for a public network. It happened before...

It's an example for the sake of argument. Sorry it rustled your jimmies. Try replacing the example with a shitty leader that won't trigger you and see if you can get the point.

There's a difference between using an open source tool and using an open source consensus system. There were many people and businesses voluntarily using Bitcoin before it was taken in a direction they didn't subscribe to. People can use competitor systems, yet this doesn't account for the time and money that businesses and individuals invested in the Bitcoin ecosystem prior to that point. Most governments let you leave the country if it goes in what you think is the wrong direction, but that doesn't mean it's always preferable to choose exit over voice.

Yes, the miners can censor tx on the side chain if they all collude (unlikely imo, all you need is one that doesn't, like with bitcoin). What I was talking about was the handful of companies managing the federated peg. THEY could in theory demand aml/kyc or payment to release the btc backing the side chain.

Started way before the 90s. Intranets had more obvious immidiate-term use cases within large institutions at the time. Sound familiar?

Ya it kind of ruins the whole "trust math and greed instead of Matt and Steve" aspect of this technology.

It's ok, at least you tried. 
@_date: 2017-05-15 06:28:27
When you go to move your BTC to the sidechain it gets locked in a multisig address controlled by the companies, and you are credited with assets on the sidechain by the companies. Assuming you got credited the assets you can send to whoever and the tx will be merge-mined. When you want to go back to BTC, you have to go through those companies again. You basically have to trust that these companies won't take your locked btc despite the fact that you'd likely have no legal recourse if they did.
@_date: 2017-05-15 04:53:49
Advantage is that it allows you to use sidechains without changing the bitcoin protocol. Disadvantage is it requires you to give control of all assets on the system to a handful of companies sharing a multisig.

You forgot the original topic: whether its useless for people to use words to express discontent in the direction of a system governed by rough consensus. I was not arguing for or against a particular direction.
To use your marriage analogy, it's about whether it ever makes sense to use voice over exit if the person you marry becomes a religious fanatic and it ruins the relationship.

I fully intend to structure this bet, managed by third parties of our choosing, if we can do it for meaningful size at a reasonable price. If you are confident in your opinion then you should be jumping at the free money I'm offering you.

These microtransactions are happening all the time, including during upmoves. Yes, they can obviously be used maliciously to flood gox with orders and lag the system.  But the argument that those trades are intended to freeze gox so that someone will get a lower bid filled is pure speculation, and you seem to be partially admitting that. People can't fathom the possibility that someone's microtransaction trading algorithm is intended for price improvement and not price manipulation?
Regardless, that's not how this "analyst" was talking about the microtransactions. Go re-read it with your great reading comprehension ability and see what he actually said:


@_date: 2013-04-13 13:14:59
I agree that until gox has the infrastructure to handle a heavy load of microtransactions they should have something (fixed fee, etc) to deter it. Just think most people are too quick to assume those trades are predatory manipulation.

Most stocks have someone who owns more than 10%, but that doesn't stop people from investing. 
Banks and governments own the majority of the world's gold, but that doesn't stop people from investing. 
Honestly, if someone had the foresight, capital, and risk tolerance to accumulate a dominant share of the bitcoin economy, they deserve to be disgustingly rich.

I've been a professional equities trader for 3 years and this analysis gave me a good laugh.
The first thing he is talking about is known as layering, stuffing, spoofing, etc and it's banned by the SEC but you can see people doing this in stocks every single day. It's an annoyance, it causes a disruption in short term price discovery, but it doesnt cause meaningful moves.
The second thing he is talking about is essentially that someone is bringing the price down by selling a ton at a low limit price and then selling a lot of small increments afterwards to make it look like everyone else is accepting that new price by selling it too. Even rehashing this joke of a theory is embarassing as I type it out. He's basically saying someone is manipulating the market by selling too much at once, and those small trades afterwards are clearly also this one guy. It couldn't possibly be just someone with a lot of BTC selling them in one chunk, followed by several small traders getting freaked out and selling. And those uniform .001 BTC trades that come one after another are algorithmic trades intended to minimize slippage and completely irrelevant to someone executing a large trade.

The longer bitcoin stays alive and active the more money mtgox should have to improve their operation.
Either that or competitors will begin to steal market share.
My guess is that it ends up being a little of both.
