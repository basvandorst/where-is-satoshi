I was wondering the same thing too during his press release.  He had that smirky look like he was hiding something.  Was wondering why nobody caught that.  Thought it was just me.

You know you can still pick up a brand new powercolor brand 280x for 219 after rebate?

Someone mentioned that instead of using DHCP, you put your network settings in manual.  
@_date: 2014-02-15 00:28:05

THE stig?
@_date: 2014-08-05 22:56:37
Can someone explain to me, with the revelation of their exorbitant fees, why the hell is anyone even using their services?
@_date: 2014-09-20 10:16:05
lol, really I wouldn't be surprised!  I needed the space tho.
@_date: 2014-12-05 23:02:35
so how much do they charge on cc payments?
edit:  nvm, just checked and it looks like they charge the same across the board.

Should rename his char type to Legendary Lich.

I'm more in the Kristoffer Koch's story camp.  While he did nothing directly, his story was a huge catalyst that pushed bitcoin into the mainstream.

As long as he doesn't monologue, he should be good.

I've always wondered, why not go to a bank and buy a cashier's check from them?
@_date: 2015-02-24 20:42:41
yay \^^/

First thing you do is talk to someone who can advise you about your taxes.

someone needs to buy this guy a drink!
@_date: 2013-11-20 07:33:07
What makes you think they haven't dumped already?
@_date: 2013-12-08 11:16:37
I sorta like to think this is a 'bounce'.  =D
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:54:13
Big fucking deal.  Would you trust your coins to a bank that'll shut down your account for 180 days for no good reason aside from someone sending you some coins?
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:25:44
Only on a full moon though.
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:58:09
Why?  If I was a merchant, I would make more of an effort to accept more coins.  Assuming fiat price stays the same, you get more coins per product.
@_date: 2013-11-16 00:55:41
me too!  =)
