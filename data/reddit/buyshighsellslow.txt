Should I buy now? What is the project price for the end of 2018?

Or maybe he sounds like a reasonable sane person.
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:20:33
On it.

I couldn't agree more. I was a bit on the wild side when I was younger and erowid really helped me educate myself about the decisions I was making.

Take your gold and get out of here.

Thanks for the feedback, I'll be doing some research when I get home.

I am working my way there one step at a time. Coinbase seems like the easiest place to get started while I continue to educate myself.

Upvoted for mentioning my girl Ricki Lake.

Thanks for your reply. I had 50 bitcoin back in the day for fun but didn't really care about the technology and lacked any foresight to see the growth that would occur. I was feeling sorry for myself for a bit but then started educating myself on the tech behind it. I wanted to understand what it was I missed out on. Mind. Blown. It has opened up a seemingly endless rabbit hole of information and I am borderline obsessing with the possibilities. I am reinvesting responsibly now and am excited to watch this tech evolve.

I'm not disputing that DXM can be fun but comparing it to LSD is a bit of a stretch.

OK what next?
