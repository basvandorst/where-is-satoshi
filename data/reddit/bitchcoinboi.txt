Thers allways a smartass. Bitcoin as money itself ia a concept we people made up in orser to trade.more efficiently if people.want btc to work it will if thwy dont it wont wnd of story
 Once upon a time gold was juat lile.bitcoin young and new but it was limited and hars to find so it emerged as money and is rexognises in the whole world now afyer gos knows how many years we have the means to make it bettee faster more divisible and usable across the world in a second that is bitcoin and thats why it will prevail in the long run
@_date: 2019-01-13 15:09:42

@_date: 2019-01-18 10:22:15
Same cant hapoen to btc once it start getting used their manipulative tactics work well on gold coz u cant so ahit with it in todays world but btc can be used daly as a curency and then it will get real world value and isiots who short it or just buy futures contract for it will end up fools because they can wipe their ass with that paper while real btc is out there gwting used i  the real world
@_date: 2019-01-05 09:39:40
Debth might drive peogress but at the cost of average joe being a debth slave who doesnt enjoy the worlds progress at all so im up for btc
@_date: 2019-01-09 23:23:07

@_date: 2019-01-04 10:53:48

@_date: 2019-01-15 15:20:29
No way
@_date: 2019-01-18 12:23:01
Yeah btc needs to grow a lot more in value
@_date: 2019-01-10 21:25:36

@_date: 2019-01-10 19:44:18

@_date: 2019-01-12 02:25:16
Rich people are rich because of their assests not their cash so they gona stay rich even if btc becomes globaly used however if they didnt get in soon enough they will be forced to sell some of their assets to the ones that did so wealth distribution will happen thats good

By bakkt launch btc will be at 6k with strong bullish uptrend patern behind it. by the end of 2019 we might see 20k again but strong 20k not a fomo bubble like in 2017
@_date: 2019-01-16 11:03:12
Bought at rhe start of 2017. I hear about it before but had no clue how to get some so i only bought at 2017 couldnt care less about the price i just hated the banks and the fiat ofc i disnt sell when it was 20k like i saod i didnt care i regret it now tho if i just invested in eth or ripple or any shitcoin id be in the money at the end of 2017 but what can u do the goal stil remains, fuck up fiat system and the banksters scum
@_date: 2019-01-10 21:26:00
U are acting like a smartass
@_date: 2019-01-11 23:38:56
Seeing that buy sell diference makes me want to smash this shit
@_date: 2019-01-16 13:04:54
Btc is not an investment as any other its an idea manly, do u have faith in the fiat system? Do u want to stick it to the banks? Do u know whats wrong with the world, do u want to be a part of the biggest revolution in history? These are the questions u must ask yourself before geting some bitcoin. if all u care about is how to buy low and sell high then dont invest in btc ever just wait till ur forced to work for it
Edited spelling errors.

@_date: 2019-01-10 19:37:49

@_date: 2019-01-10 21:28:03
Coz then buying adn selling btc ia not a problem u can pay everyone in btc then and they will just go to atm and convert to money  and since its so easy they might not even change it theyl pay the next guy and so on and also 1% dude 
@_date: 2019-01-09 19:35:25

@_date: 2018-12-29 08:30:35
Yeah but institutions do t just buy it all at once they invest weekly so i predict 2019 to go only up but slowly maybe we end the year around 10 12k
@_date: 2018-12-25 00:30:55
I bought btc at 1k fool
@_date: 2018-12-23 22:18:57

@_date: 2018-12-19 14:17:25
I figure that whales wanna earn when bakkt investors get in but still there has to be room for bakkt investors to earn so my prediction is 6k minimum before january 22
@_date: 2018-12-30 14:56:36
So some.miner gona end up with 291btc?
@_date: 2018-12-27 00:25:39

@_date: 2018-12-29 22:04:20
Phisicaly backed for sure
@_date: 2018-12-21 09:29:26
Another coin il never use, if they care about the space then they should implement payment with btc not make their own shitcoin
@_date: 2018-12-24 15:47:36
@_date: 2018-12-29 00:48:17
Do it people price might be held low with out very own bitcoins if we all pull out and prices start going up, know that exchanges allready sold our shit and need to buy it back now
@_date: 2018-12-23 18:08:49
Ln is growing rapidly is this the start of instant allmost free transactions? 
@_date: 2018-12-30 18:22:41
&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exchanges might be holding the price down with out very own bitcoins if everyone starts to pull btc out and price goes up it means that exchanges our buying back our btc &lt;/p&gt;
Edit: hope a lot of people pull out 
@_date: 2018-12-27 23:24:04
We can use the stock tactics and mentality, we put our sell orders at 50k, now naturaly everyone would like to sell at 50k even 49 but if we start doing that the price will just crash and we would becone poor but if noone is selling under 50k we would all be rich even tho noone is buying however we can all go and take a credit from the banks and put our 50k btc as a colateral now when the banksters give ua the peoples money we just give em our 50k btc coz we cant sell em.anyway we got at least 30k loan when banks try to sell the crap it all crashes we buy back our btcs at 3k banks loose peoples money governments print the money to bail out banks and everyone is happy now rinse and repeat
@_date: 2018-12-25 10:23:39
My man, i only bought for 120e tho but if we see 3k again or even aub im droping a 1000
@_date: 2018-12-24 12:15:33
First it has to be a store of value before it becomes a daly used curency most of the hodlers value their bitcoin at 10k 20k maybe even 100k and they aint planing to use it till it reaches that value 
@_date: 2018-12-26 15:49:27

True sometimes i say to my customers jokingly they can pay in btc and they say its a scam  and look realy offended when i tell them its not, and yeah they have no clue what they are talking about but still are very vigor to defend their view
@_date: 2018-12-28 17:30:25
Actualy more important part is it being deflationary
@_date: 2018-12-19 15:22:23
Better use monero 
@_date: 2018-12-28 11:08:51
Yeah classic hanging cock its the most bullish pattern in the book

When quizzed about a possible IPO for Coinbase and how its valuation must be affected by the lower prices, he recalled when the company was valued at $8 billion earlier this year, reinforcing that none of the investors were then betting on the price of the asset “today, tomorrow or even a year from now.”
