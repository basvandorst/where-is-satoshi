Ledger and Monero are just dating right now.. When they finally get hitched we are going to see a huge happy family.  The Swiss Bank Account 2.0.
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:07:49
When Monero can finally appear on Ledger, it will be the beginning of the Swiss Bank Account 2.0. Fasten your seat belts.

Getting close and people will wake up.

a recent post by u/dEBRUYNE_1 with the referenced coin taken out because this post would most likely be removed.
"A powerful question one can ask to someone that proclaims Bitcoin is fungible is whether he/she would swap ANY output (UXTO) of similar value for his/her own. I can virtually guarantee that the answer will invariably be no. A prime example:
Fungibility (which is an essential property of sound money) requires privacy by default. M++++o is currently the only cryptocurrency with a significant market cap that achieves this."
@_date: 2019-07-07 19:22:33
This is second layer implementation that is being worked on.  The base layer is what matters.  Other projects are trying to strap on privacy to their open, transparent base layer.
@_date: 2019-07-07 21:47:27
Actually, 
"The important thing we need to achieve in the base layer is not scaling. The important thing we need to achieve in the base layer that CANNOT be achieved in the layers above is privacy and fungibility with strong guarantees, simple primitives. And if we have privacy primitives and fungibility primitives in the base layer, then we can do scaling in the second layer, and we can do it securely. Otherwise, we have a privacy problem, and that privacy problem will get magnified as we go up the layers. If you can do analysis on the base layer, that gives a great degree of insight into what's happening above."

You're god damn right.
@_date: 2018-05-11 21:23:16
That's why I gift monero.
@_date: 2018-10-23 22:05:00
Not "very anonymous" at all.
Edit: down vote all you want.  It is just not.  That's OK though.

Being in Canada it really kind of sucks at the moment... The whole credit card thing, Quadriga has dropped the ball, banks are playing hardball....   If you really want to buy bitcoins just head to an ATM.  Google it and find one in your area.. Yes there is a premium on the purchase, but it's headache free..  You also find a person sometimes that wants to sell at the machine and you both can have a coffee and do some business.  It will work out better for the both of you.  Good Luck

I guess I should fess up now... Back in November my balls were resting on your keyboard.

Monero 
@_date: 2019-04-26 16:12:09
Monero is the most similar to "normal money".
@_date: 2018-02-04 03:24:46
Yeah... Everybody can see that.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:28:25
I'm focused on Monero... Because everybody else is focused on the open blockchain that is Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:29:16
lol...  My dad can beat up your dad.
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:23:41
I do know they would've spelled crytocurrency correctly.
@_date: 2018-03-07 21:00:24
Why would it?  Monero will be.

His hair line screams Monero just like he's so close to doing.

Milton Friedman predicted **Monero** 25 years ago.  It's as clear as the open ledger on Bitcoin's  face.

Dude... Don't stress your parents out more by trying to gamble crypto.  Be a son they can be proud of by keeping your nose clean.  As a parent of teen boys, you can help out right now by quicker showers and turn a light out behind you.  When your job in the winter starts, be the best you can be and build your contacts and resumé, then start to build your portfolio.  In the mean time, read a book or two, open a practice account.  Be the bookie or bartender that doesn't drink or gamble.  Learn more now because at 17 your future in crypto will be mind blowing.

Did this on purpose.  The KYC ID picture snapped at the exact same moment.

This so called leak is not an issue.  No transaction details are exposed.  [Kovri](  will also buff this scratch out.

Monero Community seeing the huge potential here... Volume needs to be turned up though.
@_date: 2019-09-10 23:00:25
You said it.  Fungibility (which is an essential property of sound money and ensures the concept of taint does not exist) can only be achieved with privacy by default.  Downvote away,
@_date: 2019-09-11 17:33:36
Why are you people kidding yourselves?

No... They GET to continually hardfork.  This semiannual system upgrade is a godsend.

The Goldengate has an amazing history and I recall Derek Stevens mentioning it was the first hotel with a pay phone in las Vegas.  Bitcoin was his equivalent contribution.
Owner of The D  and Goldengate in Las Vegas Derek Stevens.  He's usually standing at The LongBar in the D and will gladly shake your hand.  This guy gets it!

Ordered mine direct from Ledger in France.  Don't phuck around.  A few more bucks but you'll sleep better at night.
@_date: 2019-05-10 19:23:28
Different reasons.  One is a useless scam and the other is a private &amp; fungible currency with untraceable stealth addresses.
@_date: 2019-05-10 17:54:10
How come Monero isn't on that list anywhere?
Edit : Oh, yeah... never mind.
@_date: 2018-12-01 05:01:37
Meanwhile... Monero waiting patiently for people to wake up.
@_date: 2018-12-23 23:40:10
Monero has no [Rich List]( because it's private.  If it has a Rich List there is nothing private about it.
