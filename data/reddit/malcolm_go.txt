I signed up for coinbase and invested a low amount but there didn't seem to be any substantial verification process. People have mentioned ID's but all I did was sign up with my email, verify codes through my cell number and link to my bank. Am I missing something?

This should be hire. I just got into this and could easily see how a new comer would shotgun buy bcash if they thought it was the same somehow.

I recently bought for the first time. Nothing crazy like a couple hundred. Money is in Coinbase. At what point should I get a different wallet or hardware wallet? Is there a. Recommendation as to when too much is at risk for keeping in Coinbase without personal keys?

Just getting into this in the past few weeks but I think the ultimate spin will be that Bitcoin is anti American and undermines the power of the US by weakening the dollar.

Great post. I'm new and have very minimal amounts on Coinbase but as it grows I want to eventually have the hardware wallet. Is it difficult to transfer your bitcoins into the nano s? What is that process look like. What are the steps?
