For all altcoins?

The "missteps" are invented by a few vocal people.  They never really existed.
@_date: 2018-02-14 23:37:48
lol, you never do a market order, to a limit order always.
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:27:45
As exchanges increase non btc pairs, btc will fall.
Also, no one needs btc, other coins not susceptible to high fees due to popularity exist.  Other coins not susceptible to slow downs exist.
And the biggest issue, other coins with anonymity exist.  Bitcoin can never work due to the traceability of transactions.
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:39:37
You shouldn't be, those cost money.  Limit orders work the same and are free.
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:05:13


They are free.  They fundamentally have zero fees to swap coin.  That is why GDAX doesn't charge trade fees on limit orders.  They charge for market orders and withdrawals.  But that is because they do need to cover running expenses and a modest profit.
Binance wasn't listed because they are greedy and don't offer any free way to swap coin.  They tack on fees for every transaction.  That said, their fees are way way lower than network fees still.
Paying the full network fee for each exchange transaction would be insanely expensive.  It would destroy trade volume and topple the exchange.  The exchange would have to charge extract on top of the transaction fee to profit.

Except crypto will fail because if someone creates a real business model using blockchain and some coin, they are going to make a new coin.
Nothing currently on any exchange will ever succeed.  Its all failed coin tied to business models that will fail or have basically failed already.
Also, when someone does succeed, the coin really shouldn't matter.  Coin is not stock, you do not gain ownership.  A coin used for a real business purpose most likely doesn't need speculative investment inflating the cost of the coin.

Name the centralized system for transferring money that failed.


And now you agree btc is dead.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:06:52
Why would anyone go back to it when there are better options?  You are being silly.
@_date: 2018-02-14 06:59:25
How do I have an agenda?  A distributed exchange requires transactions to be on chain.  That means transaction fees.
If you dumped the volume of an exchange like binance on the blockchain, tx fees would go fucking nuts.  Its a fact of reality.
Exchanges work today by being off chain.  The coin sits in the exchanges wallet and is virtually swapped between exchange customers.  Network fees are only paid to transfer off the exchange.

Eth didn't crash like bitcoin. So no, if those things were the issue, they would have crashed eth too.
People are moving money to eth and out of other coins.
@_date: 2018-02-14 03:50:39


The fees would have to be ridiculous.  We need less fees, not more.
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:10:24
I know people suggest gemini as an alt to coinbase, but gdax has free trading with limit orders and bitcoin transfers.
Gemini charges way too much for any kind of daily trading or even large coin purchases.
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:26:32
That is exactly what I said.  Which is why if he truly was confident, they would be making more of their own founders cards to fill in the market gap since AIBs aren't making cards.
Since they are not doing that, his confidence is fake.
@_date: 2018-02-09 04:48:45
That isn't true in any way.  Tons of people in theirs 20s and early 30s trade stocks.  Very few are into crypto.  Most people don't touch crypto because its way too volitile.
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:43:54
A month and a half after the internet drama around it?  
Learn how time works.  They definitely were already working on it.
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:03:36
People shit on coin base, but they are number 1 right now. 
Their payment platform is huge for crypto.  More exchanges need payment platforms to enable stores to accept coin.
Now they are giving you the segwit you wanted.
Unless they are holding your money hostage, you should like them.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:51:27
btc was hurt by fees.  That is why eth is still doing well.  Eth replaced btc as the coin used to move money around between exchanges.
btc is never coming back.  Other coins are tanking because most exchanges only have btc pairs so as people hold eth, they can't easily swap into other coins anymore.
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:16:52
Its damn easy to see where things are going and put in a limit order.
On eth, the limit is separated from market by like 2 bucks.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:10:04
It intrigues you to ask about features that the end user benefits from?
Decentralization has zero benefit to the user.  They don't care how the network runs.  They just want cheap anonymous transaction.
@_date: 2018-02-14 06:57:46
No.  Normal exchanges are off chain.  You only pay network fees when withdrawaling.
A distributed exchange would require paying network fees for every exchange swap, that would not be good at all.  It would overwhelm most coins and cause fees to skyrocket.
Right now I can swap betwen usd, bitcoin, eth, and bcash for free on gdax.  A distributed exchange would make me pay network fees for each swap.  So if bitcoin fees skyrocket, 40 bucks a trade involving bitcoin + the fee for the other coin being swapped.
@_date: 2018-02-20 14:50:55
Because now you have miners hosting the distributed exchange, that means they must be paid.  
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:32:41
I meant gdax.  They are the same.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:08:30
Lying doesn't help your case.  Smart contracts are meaningless to people who will use it as a coin.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:10:56
But bitcoin lost its lead now.  Why would anyone go back?
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:10:58
The only way LN can handle the transactions is if large coin holders set up large hubs in the lightning network.
You may decentralize the website, but there are going to have to be a few very large wallets that can handle the volume.  Basically you still need exchange wallets and they are going to charge more fees on LN.
A distributed exchange will easily cost more per transaction than what binance is charging.
@_date: 2018-02-14 05:27:47
I am talking about what a decentralized exchange would charge.  You think something like binance is bad. A distributed exchange would have swap fees similar to existing transfer frees.
You would be paying for miners to host and process the exchange transactions.
Unloading all exchange swaps and transfers on the blockchain would overload the blockchain and skyrocket fees, just like when it cost 40 dollars to transfer bitcoin.

He is just pushing AIBs to buy chips, which is no risk to nvidia if cards don't sell.  If he was truly confident, they would be flooding the market with founders edition cards to make up for a lack of AIB production.
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:37:47
Now what are the fees for this network that doesn't exist yet?
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:40:35
lol, it has nothing to do with recent drop.
It has everything to do with a coin that has fees go up if it is more popular.  That cannot work.  And for the seedy users, they cannot use a coin with traceability.
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:09:19
LN doesn't exist yet and by the time it does, people will be off btc.
Decentralization is meaningless.  Anonymity is way more important.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:51:32
market cap means nothing really.  At best, the total amount of fake wealth people will lose.  (they only really lose the amount they bought in for)
If you want a real number find out the total amount all current owners have bought in for.  That is the true losses people are risking.
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:23:57
The idea that coinbase wouldn't adopt segwit.
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:02:06
Coinbase is free all day to swap between usd, btc, bcash, and eth.  They only charge for market orders or bank transfers.
