Still relatively new to bitcoin and missed out on the drop last time, any suggestions how long I should wait to buy this drop? It's about 1278 Canadian I bought last time at 1255 right before it dipped below 1000 for a bit

Crazy the journey Silk Road started me on just because I wanted some easy to access lsd. Might have never gotten into bitcoin further than always hearing about it.

Nice. Can anyone with knowledge on the market prices of computers in Canada tell me if Newegg is a good website to buy off of? I’ve been contemplating purchasing a pre made gaming pc from Best Buy but am interested in paying with bitcoin.

Don't listen to these guys you made the right choice.

Agreed. I’ll miss the ease of use with credit cards if they all ban purchasing crypto eventually, but overall it can only mean good things for the health of the market.

Cool thanks for the info! Its been many years since I built a computer so I was contemplating going the easy route since the premium paid on a pre built is less than usual right now with RAM and GPU prices pretty high, but maybe I’ll do some research and compare the prices and wait for the next line up of graphic cards. Thanks again.

Shows how little you know about boxing. Yes he's not the most entertaining, but to say he doesn't even really box is just dumb.

Can we just accept they will go down during days like today as the standard? I expect no less from them.

I'm loving the fact it's going down. Would like a year more of lowered expectations from people so I can accumulate more.
