Confusion/regret/anger + no life = troll
Bitcoin has a multiplier effect in that it is technical and pretty alien as a concept, so it has a high barrier of entry and is, naturally, generally dismissed on first contact. Only people that are willing to revise an earlier judgement (be open minded) will do whats necessary to overcome that barrier. Trolls tend to be pessimistic and obstinate, which excludes them, and only creates more anger as their opinion drifts from status quo to fringe over time. In order to have their opinions not be completely ignored, they are forced to move the goalposts ("Btcoin is a ponzi" -&gt; "blockchain OK, bitcoin won't work though") why trying to maintain it was their position all along.

The price of bitcoin is determined by the free market. It floats freely against other currencies on exchanges where people buy and sell it. This is actually how most currencies are priced, the difference being a central bank can influence the direction of price movement with fiat, unlike bitcoin.

Doesn't look like he's "selling out" (if that's even possible), hes just fucking around with alts. I did it when i first got bitcoin, you're curious and you try stuff out. When using alts the merits of holding bitcoin become clear (not least because everything is priced in BTC), and you move back.

I'm not OP btw, but the buy price isn't relevant for me personally because I think the outcome is binary.

In theory yes, but human nature will make short work of it. In reality the people with the most bitcoin, that have lived and held through multiple bubbles are the ones that are confident that this is business as usual. They will be buying up the BTC. The people that should be buying, the newbie, the everyman, will follow the sentiment of the crowd and sell out of fear of a capitulation.
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:05:34


That's not how it works. An alt can't rocket anywhere without adoption. Adoption takes migration of information and infrastructure.

I'm assuming that very few people are near 100% bitcoin. I'd expect most people to have somewhat diversified holdings. The price falls, the % of their crypto assets falls in value relative to everything else (unless they've got rubles), and they buy more to rebalance their portfolio.

You don't need to ignore comparative downsides to still think BTC is favorable in terms of equity. Gold isn't going to 0 but it isn't going to $10k either


I don't see this. Alts are further away than ever in terms of relative % market cap and use. It's first step is not being redundant vs BTC. An alt could take over bitcoin in the future for sure, but that alt doesn't exist today.

Good stuff, subbed.

It took me about 6 months to go from hearing about it to buying some. That 6 months, while necessary, cost me quite a chunk of change because the price ran up. Still glad i'm in though.

If no money moves its value is 0. A note in your wallet has no value until spent, so its irrelevant

I'm up over 5000% so its working out great thanks.

I like the idea although i'm not sure how engaged people would be in it, I imagine it's more fun watching pokemon than it is watching a price chart

Blockchain is the current hype word. Our banking is done on a blockchain, our backend will run a blockchain, my sandwich is a bread and cheese blockchain. Its just a word people can use to get some legitimacy as bleeding edge.

If it is working for you i would just stick with hive. If you are looking to get and save a larger amount of btc then you will need to look into cold storage (offline devices)

I'm not a mod, just used the forum, i don't see how that puts me in a 'group'. You think the same people mod 2p2 and r/poker. I just wanted to know why you thought it. I wanted to know if it was based on something or if it was just an incoherent rant.

Upvotes and downvotes on reddit are as much about tone and delivery as factual content. Preaching in absolutes in bold got you downvotes, not the content.
@_date: 2015-04-04 19:36:17
The only people moaning are the new people, and the old people that didn't buy @ $10
@_date: 2015-04-08 15:11:36
No, nothing to do with accuracy. Poor tone and delivery. Doesn't matter how factual the content may be.
@_date: 2015-04-09 00:17:40
Well yes, don't be naive, expect bad things to happen when poor actions are taken

I've been on 2p2 for years and haven't noticed any overlap between the two communities in terms of moderation, what makes you think that there is?
@_date: 2015-04-08 13:09:35
Yes, stating facts poorly.
@_date: 2015-04-04 19:32:53
You didn't even extrapolate it right
@_date: 2015-04-07 16:28:19
I thought the point of blockchain voting isn't to make the populace act in a way that is fair, it is to allow external auditing to show that the tabulation of votes is fair.

Anyone that thinks they can simultaneously mod two subs, one that exists solely to troll the other, and think they can do so without incident is less than intelligent.

It wouldn't work if you could point them out would it? That's how subterfuge works.

Not proportional at all, but I wasn't making a comment on the doxxing, I was commenting on his naievety. I wouldn't have predicted a doxxing, but I could have predicted it wasn't going to go well. Something whollyhemp, due to lack of forsight, didn't predict.

What is a bitcoin giftcard? Does the amount of bitcoin on the card fluctuate with the price to keep its value?
@_date: 2015-02-16 14:33:05
I would say that it is applicable to all of the above, apart from
* Standard games that use bitcoin as currency for micropayments?
* Integrating bitcoin into mainstream games (as a payment option maybe)?
These are just games that accept bitcoin, not bitcoin games

Going long on bitcoin isnt like traditional currency speculation. The returns are based on the utility/perceived utility of the network. It is closer to investing in a tech start up.

Because only the US has internet access..

Bitcoin is global. The US only numbers are irrelevant

I doubt any of the people you think that are paid, actually are. Mainly because if it were someones job they would be better at it. ie it wouldn't be so overt because it is easy to just dismiss someone whose post history shows it's all they do. When it happens professionally it is more subversive. The people that spend 24/7 posting anti bitcoin comments are people that are deeply emotionally invested in its failure and/or mentally ill.

People concerned about anonymity aren't going to be using BTC ATMs anyway. They're a newbie on ramp, not darknet facilitators
