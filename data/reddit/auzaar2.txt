No it will not take 5-10 years to mine rest, here is expected timeline 
But YES Block reward would be very less in few years but 
a) bitcoin prices could much higher, e.g. if at each halving every 4 years price doubles reward would be constant 
b) As number of transaction go up and fees are sufficient, mining would still be profitable
If no body is mining difficulty would reduce and it will become profitable to mine, so if bitcoin remains popular mining will also be profitable.

If you don't understand "autonomous network watches everything" then you don't understand distributed networks and consensus.
You are asking "what rules", did you expect to list whole bitcoin protocol in 30 seconds elevator talk? 
Bitcoin can not be copied, alt-coin is not bitcoin. "Transfer like a real coin" means it is a real entity whose ownership can be transferred , which when leaves your hand is gone. Now you will be asking how Bitcoin can leave hand?
Are you perplexed when programmers say this bug is hard to catch? Because there is no insect to be seen, what you can even catch/hold in lines of code on a terminal and how can it be hard when it is called software.
When a software packet is transmitted is there a real packet which is transmitted? Does is even is a single packet, are the bits even real or they are interpreted as such? What does firewall mean, I see no fire and no wall.
Does computer virus have DNA or RNA?
When you rent a single movie online, how can it be transmitted to multiple screens?
I think you are lacking imagination, so fail to understand the abstraction, or may be you are just old and wanted a bookish answer, which you can have just picked up from 
and your ignorance is clear from "I can also make copies of the Bitcoins I hold."
I can also take photos of my $10 bill and even print it, that doesn't mean anything.

What you answered is "What is Bitcoin?" not "How it works?"
I would say 
"Bitcoin is a digital coin which can not be copied and can be transferred from person to person like a real coin. Though real coins are minted by government, for Bitcoin there is no such central authority instead a big autonomous computer network watches everything and makes sure rules are followed."

What is your definition of investing? if miners are getting 1 million dollar everyday then somebody is putting that much money.

A complex solution to a problem which doesn't exist, 1 bitcoin would be enough to support bitcoin economy.

No you don't have to save private key, when there is a address without private key, it asks at the time of creating the transaction, you can also disconnect from internet while creating the transaction and then relay transaction separately using  that way your private key never leaves your computer, and you don't have to trust the site that much or at-least are secure from future attacks.

It may be complex but with enough miners it would be stable at a given time, also suppose if all miners are filtering out transaction with fee&lt; 5 % then there will be a market where for very low fee I can add many low fee transactions into blockchain may be in days
