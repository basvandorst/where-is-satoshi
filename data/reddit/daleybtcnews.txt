oh believe me i despise spoofing as much as you. these are essentially already wealthy people tricking (a.k.a. stealing) less fortunate inexperienced traders. these are the kinds of people we should be locking up, but instead we have a "justice" system that seems to prefer punishing those already down on there luck. WHAT A CROCK!!!

It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a PROFOUNDLY sick society.

ya thats just something wealthy people say to help them sleep at night. there could be equality but those who have it all will never give it up. thats the reality. greed rules the world.
and the answer isnt crypto, its far more complex and it involves the abolition of money class and the very concept of wealth, what it is and what it means to be wealthy. it would require taking down the entire marketing system, the entertainment industry everything the feeds the notion that money is all that matters till money no longer matters at all. but most people are incapable of even imagining such a thing. small minded people like yourself unable to see beyond the immediately obvious.

people like you always say something STUPID like that. take your delusional ultimatums and shove 'em where the sun don't shine :) i hope you found that rude because that was my intent because that's how i deal with idiot replies.
fact is you would not like to learn more about ANYTHING because you already think you know Everything. that's your type. i know it well because i see it all the time. take comfort in the knowledge that you're just like everyone else. welcome to the herd, enjoy your stay, clearly, with that line of thinking, you will be here for a while.

your life being good isn't good enough because as long as there are people in poverty your "good" life will NEVER be secure.
