I am sure you don’t mean it “would be fun to watch others to lose I guess” ... 
Real estate bubble was caused by irresponsible &amp; greedy bankers and banks just not having measures of granting mortgages... 
In dotcom bubble if you had shares of amazon at 95-100 which was its highest you would have made immense profits ... 
I think it is not about a pop as a financial advisor how you hedge your bets..

Agree, (it was Netflix and google etc but that’s not the point) I am just saying that you should always hedge your bets and not invest recklessly..  and if we say bitcoin is going to 0 it doesn’t make sense for me if we say it is going to crash let say it crashes back to 3-5k still people who bought before October are loosing 0% of there capital and may gaining 15-20% which in a year is good investment .. now people invested at 10-15K they can keep there 3-5k in remove all out as part of there hedge if incase there is crash they can put it back in and people like me who are in because I believe that we would have bitcoin as a store of value and medium of exchange (though fees are really high today and this has to change) if future (which is max 10years from today in my opinion)  so as a financial advisor you just make sure your conservative clients don’t lose money and your aggressive clients lose in an event of crash the amount they can bear ( for me if goes to 0 my initial investment of 2800 something I can afford to lose) 
Point is just to support by your experience everyone can have different opinion.

 .. may be as English is not my mother language I can interpret it wrong but if you think little deeper.. opinions are turned into advice and advice becomes decisions in the end...

How shall it work if RBI is blocking the transaction related to crypto?
