well, it is related to both bitcoin and xcp because xcp is running on top of bitcoin

No, Bitcoin is not anonymous and not untraceable. If you got your coin from a drug dealer and miners may exclude your transactions that try to spend those BTCs.

if you want to long bitcoin, it is probably not the best way to do it buying bitcoin. There is other much better method

It is not really anonymous. Every bitcoin can be traced all the way to the coinbase transaction that generate it. Since the ledger is public, everybody can trace your bitcoin. For example, if you buy a BTC at coinbase.com for $400 each, and sell it 2 years later at $10,000. IRS may target you for tax

Derivatives are ok if you don't use other people's money to bet. Since in the cryptocurrency age, each one kept his money in his own bank (private key), there is no way for financial institution to bet with other people's money and poses "too big to fail" problem.
As for your question of whether the contract will be honored in the midsts of a financial crash, I will say that is where smart contract will be useful. Whether a margin call will be sent out or close-out position will be executed, the contagion will be contained because the financial institution cannot use our money to bet

Nothing is gonna happen this year. halving only mean nothing, nothing, nothing and nothing!
Bitcoin is too deployed to make any change.
Vcash is the future--zerotime (coins are instantly respendable by the receiver with a lock on the output  that feed the input), zeroledger, client side chain blender(anom), adaptive block size, ASIC proof mining
John Connor have them all in this coin:

Sell you BTC to lock in your profit and pay back your loan. BTC price will collapse to under 200 after halving
