"Most Zombie Formalism arrives in a vertical format, tailor-made for instant digital distribution and viewing via jpeg on portable devices. It looks pretty much the same in person as it does on iPhone, iPad, Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest, and Instagram. Collectors needn’t see shows of this work, since it offers so little visual or material resistance. It has little internal scale, and its graphic field is taken in at once. You see and get it fast, and then it doesn’t change. There are no complex structural presences to assimilate, few surprises, and no unique visual iconographies or incongruities to come to terms with. It’s frictionless, made for trade. **Art as bitcoin.**"

@_date: 2014-01-05 03:10:22
I would have thought so too. But in fact to receive money from abroad, Wells Fargo charges me about 16$. In addition I'll have to pay approximately another 20$ at my bank in Europe for the transaction. Say, if I was to sell 5 BTC on coinbase (not at the price of 831$) it would be 41$ in fees.
It surprises me, I would have thought too that it would be much cheaper...

It is possible, but quite complicated.
I think your safe if you do the following:
*  Format a USB Stick with two partitions
*  get an Ubuntu Live Image running on one partition
*  download and copy an image of something like bitadress from github onto the second image
You can now boot any laptop with the live image, copy the paper wallet image onto the desktop, unzip it and generate a secure wallet. Write down or print the private key.
If you need any further instructions on how to create such a Live Image send me a message if you can't find something online.

Thanks for your answer, please let me clarify. I'm still confused about how Circle actually works.
* I created an account Oct 27th.
* "Paired" the account with my Wells Fargo Account
* On Nov 9th I decided to "Add Funds" and deposited 1,294.63 USD from my Wells Fargo Account
* Immediately after I was able to withdraw 500USD worth of Bitcoin, which equaled 1.37661409 BTC. I transferred those to my Paperwallet.
In my account it have 0.00 USD/0.00 even though my history claims, that I have deposited 1,294 USD. All I ever got was 500.
[Screenshot Account]( [Screenshot Transactions](
My question is, what happens to the rest of my 1,294 USD? Now where the price has gone up, will I still be getting the amount of BTC from when I deposited the USD? Or will I get less?
Note: No money was taken from my Wells Fargo account yet.
@_date: 2014-02-04 13:40:10
Thanks! I totally agree.
It's early in the morning in the US now, give it a few more hours and we'll probably see a massive shit storm going over this thread. But I'm still confident, Bitcoin is too good to be only painted in black or white.
@_date: 2014-03-23 18:04:47
Bitcoin is great and it has the potential to change a lot. But it is not a currency (in fact we probably haven't found a word for what it is yet)  and will not be replacing the USD/EUR/etc in the near or far future.
There is also a much bigger chance that bitcoin will be used parallel to these currencies - most times just because it will make things easier or because it creates new forms of payments (for which fiat couldn't even be used for).
I agree that many economists that speak out against BTC have not fully understood what BTC, the blockchain, etc is. But there is many that did and they usually know more about finance and markets then the average r/bitcoin-subscriber. I talk to them, a lot and with my biggest interest from a pro-BTC perspective.
If you open your eyes and make a step outside the usual circlejerks, you'll be able to understand that BTC not only comes with a great potential, but also with a few flaws.
@_date: 2014-03-23 10:25:24

I totally agree with you and I'm sure that, if Bitcoin succeeds, it will also be a game changer in a political sense. But this will have to be a slow process and can not be forced onto people or governments.
Many of the things that I hear people complaining around here just don't concern european bitcoiners. Period. And it will be even less of an issue for future indian, chinese or african bitcoin enthusiasts.

Some (actually most) people around here think, that all that BTC needs to succeed is to be a medium of exchange. In fact, if you look at economy from a more serious perspective, you'll soon start to understand that money (as we know it) has much more functionality and properties.
Let me give you one example: Bitcoin - people around here think - would be sufficient as a functional medium of exchange if all goods and services already existed: Give me this, I'll give you x BTC, now I'll do something for you and you give me y BTC. This is more or less how things would work on a flea market, a very closed system of goods (books you found in your attic) and services (me carrying your bags to your car). All fine - I agree.
But there is this women, she sells coffee. She bought the coffee machine x months ago (0.5 BTC) and bought a huge bag of beans last week (0.5 BTC). While somebody sells books that already exist, she invested to create new products to be sold at the flea market. Her risk doing so is extremely high. I don't care about the volatile nature of BTC, let's even say this problem is already solved, but if she doesn't sell any or enough coffee in a certain amount of time, she actually lost money - remember, it's still a deflationary economy! Besides that, over time, the price for one cup of her coffee also has to go down (x months later a bag of beans only costs 0.3 BTC and the guy selling coffee next to her booth just opened a fresh bag he bought the day before).
By the time she has earned back half of what she invested, she might have run out of coffee beans or could have already bought 3 times the amount of beans or 2 coffee machines etc. Do you understand where I'm getting at?
Again, BTC is great as a payment method and I truly believe that the blockchain can be a game changer. But as an alternative decentralized and - sorry, bro - unregulated currency it will only keep existing in wet libertarians  dreams.

I have been responding to many posts in this thread now and I have answered most of the questions you brought up with your comment already.
As a more general answer, let me say that: I'm surprised how (probably also purposely) misinterpreted I get in most of the comments and how sad it is, that most of the negative comments are painted in black and white only.
The title of my original post already implies that bitcoin has a political agenda but I expect it to succeed without it.
I can imagine bitcoin to be a bankless (no middle-man) currency without having to shut down governments.

This worked well for me: 
It´s german, but I'll give you crash-instructions on how I did it:
- Make at least two Partitions (FAT or FAT 32) on a USB Stick (the smaller one can be about 50MB). Use Disk-Utility.
- Download  (Ubuntu 12.04 32bit)
- Download bitaddress (don't unzip - Safari unzips automatically, use Firefox instead)  and copy zip to the small partition
- On the bigger partition create a folder called "efi"
- create a folder called "boot" in the "efi"-folder
- Download [this]( and copy both .efi files into the "boot" folder
- now copy the whole Ubuntu image as is into the "boot" folder (don't mount or open the image, just the raw image)
That´s it. Restart and hold ALT on your keyboard on restart and choose to boot Linux. Once you're on the Linux OS, find the image with your copy of the bitadress package. Drag and drop to the Desktop. Unzip (you might drag and drop again from the Unzip-App) and start the magic.
Stay offline.
Edit: changed the download link.

The sentiment in this thread is: we have (keep) the money and we decide what to do with it. Why should any of it given to the government and why should we loose control over what to do with it?
It is obvious that private contractors are building our roads and not politicians or ministers. Now I have a question for you: say, you live in a village with 5000 people, close to a large city (500 000).
How will you convince those living in the city to spend their money on renewing the streets that connects your village to their city? I think you will not be very successful.

Napracan, I appreciate your response. A lot.
Even though I do not completely agree with what you say, it is written in a way that it encourages me to read further and stay open minded instead of blocking it all off, saying: Nay, whatever!
I can't say that about most of the other responses.
Still, some of what is happening in this thread reminds me to [this]( I feel like people here are misinterpreting my views/concerns while I also think that some of their attitude (all politicians are gangster/tax is theft/...) are a bit too paranoid.
My fear is, that much of what I hear in regards to bitcoin could lead in a capitalistic system worse than the one we're already in, eventually turning into a plutocracy.
Edit: Also, we should probably keep in mind, that every user here has made a different experience. I live in a country in Europe that is on the list of the 10 richest in the world. Our tax - even though there IS a lot of corruption - still goes into schools, libraries, social security, health, etc. I imagine I would probably feel different if my money was used to finance wars etc.

I've also been in several cities in China, the US and visited pretty much all of the european capitals.
So, I guess I can tell the difference between mud paths between 60-70 people villages and the one that I've described in my earlier post.

Thanks, already in my coinbase account. Good luck!

I agree that CC could have a strong impact on our future society but your views honestly scare me.
I don't want to live in a world where only those who can afford it are healthy and educated – no, wait, now I understand we got rid of the gangsters...
**Update**: I just re-read your comment and the fact that it was voted to the top, scares me even more. Maybe I had a wrong impression about the political/social background of the bitcoin community. Besides all technical issues around security/transparency/decentralization I understood that BTC, due to it's mechanics, could also help to stabilize social conflicts – if used wisely.
It now seems to me that this is not on top of the list. Instead I get the picture that most of you (at least in this thread) are only interested to accumulate and *protect their wealth*.
Don't get me wrong, I think it is a problem that the knots between those who are responsible and in charge for financial decisions (global/local) are to tight with these non-governmental institutions (banks/cooperations/etc.). BTC, like any other currency, is a perfect tool to bypass these.
But a modern society can not rely on private benefactor and patrons. That being said, you´re now welcome to downvote me into oblivion.

Thanks, guess that's the way to go then.

Your suggestion is very regressiv.
Let´s see what happens next. Now the 5000 people can not rebuild or pay up for the road themselves. What are their options?
- they can move away
- steal materials and try renewing their street
- ~~use public transport~~ (already canceled due to economical reasons)
Is that really what you want?
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:30:05
Because it is not necessary in the country where I live.
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:13:32
I disagree.
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:30:11
It is where I come from.
And I'm glad that our universities or hospitals are still run/owned by the government and not any private company/person.
But I guess that should be a whole different thread.
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:35:54
Thanks! Works great!

You're probably right.
I´m merely interested in technical/financial solutions on how this could be handled.
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:00:39
Maybe a stupid thought: but given the easiness of transacting money with bitcoin, wouldn't it be possible to attach the tax with every item that is bought and put through directly to the respective financial institutions directly?

To me, this couldn't be more vague. What law exactly is he talking about? How are the profiteers going to profit from it?
It reminds me to a party-quiz I like to play with friends: Three kids saved each 10$. They decide to buy a football that cost 30$ in a store nearby. After they leave the store the owner says to his shop assistant: What nice and well behaved kids. I should have given them a discount of 5$.
The assistant replies, that one of the kids lives in his neighborhood and he can pass the 5$ on to him. He drives home from work and visits the kid, telling him about the discount but only hands him 3$, keeping two in his own pockets. The kid, still happy about the discount, runs to his friends and gives them each 1$.
Each kid has now paid 9$ for the ball. 9 x 3 equals 27$. Together with the 2$ that are in the assistants pockets it sums up to 29$. Where's the missing Dollar? 
Obviously it's a matter of how you look at things. If you insist on the equation above, I will not be able to satisfy you with the actual solution which is: the football was only 25$, each boy got 1$ (3) back and 2$ are in the assistants pocket. 30 Dollars.
I really appreciate your comments but was a bit disappointed on how weak the links were that you've sent me. They appear to me like the equation with 29 as a result. I honestly expected something more substantial.


The above mentioned also applies for Nozick's Tale of the Slave. The whole concept of this video is based on a rhetorical principle. There's so much gaps in-between each stage, so much missing and misleading.
He is suggestive and not very clear when it comes to connections between one stage and the other, it makes it impossible to argue about it.


I can't really comment on this since I haven't jet had time to watch it entirely.


Okay, this was probably the must complex and informative link. I've just printed it and will look over it tonight.


Exactly this is what drives me mad and also scares me so much: the idea that things on a free market will always improve (in that case law enforcement/arbitration/laws). I do not agree with it. And if it will improve, then only for those who can afford it.
I really try understanding this but I can't stop wondering why exactly anarchists or voluntarist support this idea. In my naive thinking, I would have assumed the opposite.
I know cases in which civil guards were installed in cities and am looking in fear over the boarder towards Hungary, where in 2007, a non-governmental paramilitary organization (Hungarian Guard Movement) was installed. They mainly focus on kicking Roma Peoples asses, parade and chant nationalistic hymns. I know this is not directly connected with the above, but where's the boarder between the first and the second? Who will be defining it?
Another point Friedman makes is the one about the victimless crime. He describes how governments create criminals by forbidding things (drugs as an example). The exact same thing will happen in Friedman's example: If I sell alcohol and you sell drugs (which is technically the same), what stops me from finding a reason to legally forbid you the sale of drugs? Why should I not contact my private right enforcement agency and try to hit you (with whatever I find, be it as ridicule as it can)?


I find it a bit surprising, that such a list exists and I find it partly too biased. Commenting this would be impossible as there are far too many "fallacies" to be walked through.
Just an example:


"You keep talking about taxation and regulation at gunpoint. I don't see any gun! When I pay my taxes, there's no gun to my head."


The fact that most submit before the gun is drawn doesn't negate the existence of the gun. (KH)
Why so radical? Can there not be more than two ways? When I pay my tax, I don't think about a gun, but about the necessity of giving back parts of what I have taken or still get.
When I started this thread I was merely interested in technical aspects and solutions of taxation of BTC transfers. It has turned a lot into a political debate. I realize that criticism is not very welcome in these kind of circle-jerkish subreddits, but I have my doubts and wanted to address them.
I also get the feeling that many in this forum are not really interested in the political/social/economical aspects of bitcoin. I like to look at it theoretically and discuss how it would affect our lives if it was to become something like an official currency. Yes, precisely the fact that it is a global, decentralized currency which is bound to certain mathematics and formulas instead of politicial and economical decisions, makes it so intriguing. What I would like to see is how this is taken as a chance to improve society instead of improving your own individual decision.
The sentiment here is a different one.
