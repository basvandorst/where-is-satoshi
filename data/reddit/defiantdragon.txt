Especially since, essentially, those same fees still exist, it's just that Bitcoin transfers the "fees" client-side.
Depending on what Bitcoin is trading at on a given day those fees can be much, much more than the cost of using VISA.
However, again, the customer is paying for it, not the user so... that should help with adoption.

Well, the ones that held.
Right now you have Bitcoin being quietly scooped up by the old guard.
The entire marketcap of Crypto is currently $321 Billion... from a high of ~$750 Billion.
How much would you pay to completely own a new, unregulated emerging market? Let alone, legally-- if unethically-- double your already vast fortune?
A lot of the new oligarchs sold out for lambos that are already degrading while the old guard is quietly counting coins.

It's essentially insider trading.
'I've got a huge amount of money I'm about to move out of Litecoins and put into Feathercoins.  Invest in Feathercoin now, before I do.'
The trick is that they actually do that for a while, for people to build up trust in their ability to move the market -- and then, wham, once people start to get lazy, they fuck up the system and take a whole lot of idiots for a whole lot of money.

Okay, well, the day you get some decent options for us Canadians, you're going to see an explosion.  I know lots of people who are interested in BTC but are like 'what the hell would we use it for' (and the various shady markets online don't really help people feel secure).
Find a way for us to trade BTC for Shoppers Drug Mart Gift Cards in Canada and you're going to be rolling in BTC.
Shoppers is famous because their Gift cards are very useful pretty much anywhere in the country, they carry a wide selection of other gift cards from all over and it's no hassle at all to trade in a Shoppers Gift Card 1:1 for pretty much any of the ones they carry.
Seriously, forget your Walmarts etc, aim for SDM.

People are selling LTC as some sort of 'Silver' to Bitcoin's 'Gold'...
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:28:28
Litecoin is going up because of the psychological need for people to own '1' of something instead of '.005' of something.
Litecoin is Bitcoin's stepchild and many are trying to pass it off as 'silver' to Bitcoin's gold.  Which isn't really true - technically any of the altcoins could be the 'silver', it's just that litecoin has the second most name recognition.
Litecoin is still cheap enough to get in 'on the ground floor' for many, hoping it will duplicate BTCs growth (And for those that got in at $5 or so, it's done well for them).
But getting out of Litecoin is harder than getting out of Bitcoin, so it's not very liquid.  Many are buying litecoin low, then going on BTCE and trading profit from litecoins for BTC. (if they're lucky).

Someone's burning through a lot of BTC...
The wallet that mine came to is the one I use for faucets only.
Good to know, I won't merge them just to be safe ;)
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:10:01
Exactly, right now Bitcoin is less of a currency and more of a commodity.  People are buying in to ride the wave up and cash out in fiat.  That leads to stuff like the correction we had today - $900 -&gt; $580-ish -&gt; $700+
It's all very normal.  Just ride it out and you'll be fine.
Damn, I wish I was richer so I could afford to use this knowledge to really get my finances to take off.  I bought 1 BTC at $440-ish and that pretty much tapped my savings, but on the bright side, It's now worth $700+... so I guess I can't complain...  Still, I'd be much happier if my local supermarket accepted BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:04:40


I'm counting on it.
I'm not in it to cash out.  Bitcoins, in about 10 years, once it starts to stabilize, will be a viable world currency in and of themselves.  And that's what I'm investing in.
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:50:48
If it doesn't confirm, does that mean I won't get my money?
I've got a couple unconfirmed from some faucets, if they don't get confirmed, they get sent back - meaning I don't get to keep the money, right?
Meaning I've wasted my time etc. (They make you save up to x number of mBTC in order to cash out, so that takes time).
@_date: 2013-11-14 19:50:53
Yeah, but the USD is a Reserve Currency, so that make sense.  It's also AMERICA's reserve currency.
Bitcoin is an upstart, a competitor.  But an 'American' competitor.
@_date: 2013-12-14 04:42:03
This is part of a growing effort to 'wall off' BTC.  They can't stop it but they can force it back underground through regulation.  Make it the currency of pedophiles and theives (or whatever their spin will be).  Did anyone truly think the most powerful nations in the world would just let their currencies go quietly into the night?
Hell, the US has levelled nations to ensure that USD remains supreme.
Basically, BTC needs to raise its game - they can't stop itfrom circulating but they can make it incredibly difficult to transact out of it.  At which point BTC ends up in the realm of Cuba's Convertible Pesos - a money only because a set number of people are willing to transact with it but utterly worthless outside that sphere.
There are ways around this, of course, but in the world of fiat there will neverbe an end to the amount of money they can bring to bear against you.

EDIT: As a Canadian, what are my options outside of Localbitcoins for instant Fiat to BTC? Don't suppose there's a way to easily buy BTC with Credit, huh? (Amortize my BTC purchase over a few months?)
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:07:03
Hrmm perhaps your thoughts on this then?
@_date: 2013-11-14 23:01:06
Yeah, if one was going to really prep for the end, they should focus on  learning important skills - learn about medicine, first aid, field surgery, etc.  What processed foods are safe to eat after expiry (and for how long).  How to create water filters (not that hard).  These are the kinds of things that a community can build on - and that would make you an essential part of it, should something big and bad happen.
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:06:34
That's exactly how I explain it to others.  Would you leave your $20 cash sitting on the dash of your car with the door unlocked?
Your bitcoin wallet is like that except it's behind the equivalent of nuke-proof glass.
When you don't 2FA your wallet you're essentially shutting the car door but leaving the window rolled down a smidge. It'll stop anyone who doesn't give a care about trying to get in there, but the moment a motivated criminal gets on the scene...
With Bitcoin, anyone can see what you leave on your dash.  Just make sure to lock your door (and turn on the alarm) before you go.
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:11:21
Hey, thanks for the heads up!
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:30:21
Yeah, that's the stigma.  Or that you're a crook.
Basically: "Only people who HAVE to deal with cash (because they don't want their shit tracked) carry cash on them."  Especially if you carry something like more than $100 cash on you here in Canada.
A buddy of mine had $300 cash on him and all of us were like 'are you nuts?'
But that just goes to show, that yeah, it's an idea that's become (and becoming) pervasive.
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:40:19
That's why there's also a move to get rid of cash and move to electronic payment - it's just taken a really long time to get here.  In Canada, electronic payment is big.  I know almost no one who carries cash on them in day-to-day life.  People here like the 'security' of knowing that if they're robbed they can get their money back.
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:36:26
One guy told me:
"Look, Bitcoin's logo is Gold - Litecoin's is Silver.  It's right in the logos!"
I told him maybe he shouldn't get involved in Cryptos, sounds like he might lose a lot of money.
I've heard quite a few people saying that LTC is basically a big Pump and Dump - great if you get on early and out on time, but a lot of people buying in at $30-40 are going to be left holding an empty bag.

Blockchain has 2nd password required for withdrawal (but you have to enable it).
@_date: 2013-12-01 12:56:40
That's a hell of a lot of work just to use money.
Bitcoin's power is that it's supposed to be fast and easy.  This is good if you want to hide the coins away and almost never touch them.
Just up pick a good online wallet like Blockchain, keep 2 factor authorization on for logging in, turn on 2nd password (so you can't spend without a second PW).  Use a different address for each transaction and don't keep any more than 1 BTC in there at any one time.
Easy ;D
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:40:53
Hopefully you've got 2 factor authentication on there.
@_date: 2013-11-16 20:11:44

2FA is pretty good for most people who aren't running around with 200,000 BTC.  Plus, really, as long as you don't run around bragging about how much BTC you have, most people will never even know you have it.

@_date: 2013-11-14 19:37:02
Well the important part is that if you've broken an American Law, then you're in for it.

Economically speaking, Bitcoin is barely out of the womb and kicking.
The USD - the world's only Reserve currency (tho' for how much longer...?) - has had several dozen decades to get their shit together and stabilize.
Bitcoin will get there, eventually.  As security grows, so too will stability.
The USD represents the economic might of one (albeit, mighty) nation.
Bitcoin has the potential represent the total economic might of the world.
A true, single, universal currency.
And THAT's why you should be buying in.
Don't trust your Government?
Trust the Math.

@_date: 2013-09-17 20:54:16
If I had bought a bunch of bitcoins, say last year and just held them in a wallet (online), without using them or touching them, how secure would they be?  Is it true that the act of using bitcoins is what opens up the vulnerability for your other bitcoins to be attacked/raided?
@_date: 2013-09-17 20:33:31

@_date: 2013-11-14 19:23:11
Yeah, it's basically a commodity at this point and people are rushing in to buy (Which means we're in the lower part of the S curve).  But with there only being so many Bitcoins in existence, there's only so much real estate to buy.  Once all the coins are mined in, what, 2016? Then there will be nothing but the exchange of coins and then a pure case of supply and demand.  Many are buying in now to 'stake a claim' on the hope that a single BTC settles around 10K or something (And everyone is trading in mBTC for daily stuff).
Whether that actually happens or not largely depends on whether or not technology advances to the point where interested parties manage to pull off a 51% attack or regulate all the fun out of the currency.  If left to its devices, and we stay on the S-curve while making it easier for others to enter the market, I can see BTC easily getting into the 800-1k mark next year-ish.
@_date: 2013-11-16 20:28:52
As a relative newb who just opened a blockchain wallet, thanks for this. I don't want any of my BTC associated with this kind of nonsense. Either be open source or don't, but quit lying to the community about being open source if you're not keeping your code current. 
I've got a big group of friends who are coming in with me (I got  them set up with blockchain too). Guess I'm moving everyone somewhere else. 
Any recommendations for someplace similar and open source/secure?

Thanks - Actually, I'm not even sure what I want just yet. I just learned (oh, about an hour or two ago) about how incredibly paranoid one has to be when using and moving their bitcoins around.
From the looks of it, even using your bitcoins online exposes the rest of your bitcoins (along with your possible bank statements/history?) to possible thievery, etc - and the thieves seem quite adept at getting away without being found.
I really want to get involved in Bitcoin, but it seems worse than the wild west in a lot of the worst ways.
Of course, this is first impressions - but to be honest, the last two-ish hours of reading this sub has done more to put fear into me and make me re-think investing than any concerns about big banks, etc.
I'm not done yet, and probably being somewhat scared/aware of the realities isn't necessarily a bad thing... but fuck.  Definitely not something you want to dive into.
I figure a good 3-5months of reading daily before I can start to feel comfortable putting some money in.
Hell, by then maybe the market will have settled some too.  (Those are some wild-ass fluctuations... wow).
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:29:37

It's primarily about education.
And those of us who do know being patient with those who don't.
We have to realize that it really is a whole new world and a good deal of us (even those just getting into it now) are on the Vanguard of this thing.
First thing I tell all newbies is to come on lurk for a while.  Teach themselves (that way the lessons will stick) and learn from the mistakes of others.
This is a marathon not a race and, looking at the long life ahead of BTC, the starting pistol has just gone off.
