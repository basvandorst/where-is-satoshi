Thanks, so in essence a hardware wallet is 2fa + physical device in-hand authentication for signing transactions?
With all the stories I’ve read about Trezor wallets being hacked at source and issues with firmware it’s made me hesitant to invest, but I do want some security. 
Suppose, I’ll need to do a little more research.

Google 'Dollar-cost averaging**'** if you treat it like saving monthly/weekly and do it for the long haul you'll be fine.

The moment I visit your site my iPhone turns blisteringly hot. You guys should look into that.

Can someone tell me the difference between say using a hardware wallet (Trevor/Ledger) vs using the BRD app on iOS?
So for example, once I’ve written and stored my seed in BRD, simply deleting the app from my iPhone to essentially make it a “cold” wallet, then only reinstalling as needed to transact. 
I’m just trying to educate myself, hopefully this isn’t a stupid question.

I think it’s a matter of need also. In economies that are suffering from hyperinflation you’re more likely to figure out the issues because it has a fundamental impact on you.
In developed “stable” economies you’re less likely to bother if you’ve got fiat that works for you and your paper nicely stored away in a bank. 
Definitely a snowball falling down a mountain type of deal I reckon.

Really curious to know where you go from here. I’m in the same position.

I’d say 10k is a pretty strong support level, like you say it’s bounced around a few % for a fair few days now. 
The only thing is that Bakkt announced they’re proceeding with ETF (I think the news was) and the price rallied up to like 10.4k, but lost steam pretty quickly which is a shame. 
Either way, I’ve bought at 10.8, 10.6, 10.4 and 10.1 because if we were to bounce I didn’t want to miss out.
Zoom out the charts and you’ll see that in the grand scheme of things we’re still on an uptrend and growth will still be incoming..... hopefully.

No. Centralised (them) vs Decentralised (Bitcoin).

When I think back to when I was trying to grasp the idea of Bitcoin, I first needed to understand money and that was the hardest part. But once I understood that, the rest flowed. 
So now when trying to explain Bitcoin, I just say that “Bitcoin is digital cash” people get cash vs card so it tends to connect.

I don't know where you're from but here in the UK we've been told time and time again that there is no such thing as a "magic money tree" by the government when the people were demanding pay increases for our firefighters, policemen/women and nursing staff in the NHS, who hadn't received an increase higher than inflation within the last 5+ years, (*this means that these people have seen a wage* ***decrease*** *with some of our public sector workers resorting to food banks just to make ends meet*). Only for the then government to find one **BILLION** pounds down the back of the sofa to give to another political party to form a coalition government. 
The point I'm trying to make is, although we may pay our taxes for a good reason the people in power who control that money do not always use it for good.
I happy to pay my taxes but I would very much like a decentralised public government ledger so the people can see all the spending and where our taxes actually go to be put to use. 
The sooner Bitcoin makes it to the mainstream the better it will be for the people.

Just watched the video, it doesn’t look good for Bitcoin from a mainstream point of view and there is still lots of work to be done. 
Lots of BTMs were not working and stores that he went to that advertised as accepting Bitcoin online were in fact not doing so and the YouTuber didn’t seem to have a grasp in relation to wallets and function of wallets. 
Feel like he should do some better research next time and give it another go in a month or something like that.

Big fan of the name OurTube. 
I feel like this is a prime opportunity for the Brave/BAT platform/token.

Would you elaborate on this point because I have a different viewpoint If you're interested.
@_date: 2019-12-31 01:18:43
If possible I’d do a percentage of both.

Interesting point, however, it's not one I agree with personally.
I would say that the vast majority of people are not interested in the mining side of crypto, especially as it's beyond the reach of the average individual, however, to say that crypto makes "no sense" and that people are "happy with others looking after their money" seems a little ignorant.
