The bootable tails solution is perfect as long as it is on an offline PC.  
   
Create a watch only wallet on your online desktop. Whenever you want to spend you create the transaction on the online PC with the watch only electrum wallet. Then you safe the transaction to USB. Plug it into offline PC. Sign the transaction. Safe back to USB. Transfer to online PC and broadcast transaction.

It's very unlikely that your transaction has not confirmed within the last 24 hours.  
If you are withdrawing from an exchange contact support.  
It's unlikely that you are using a wallet that lets you set a fee below 1 sat/byte.  
  
Transactions will float around so long until:  
 
They are confirmed.  
You create a competing transaction that gets confirmed and spends the same output(s).  
  
  
Most Wallets let you either, create a new transaction with higher fees (rbf), forget the transaction so you can create a new transaction.

You got it backwards. CC payments can be reversed for 30 days or so; it's like an unconfirmed transaction.   Bitcoin's transactions are irreversible after 1 confirmation (most of the times) basically impossible to reverse after 6 confirms.

There is no proof they can do that. Every other blockchain has fast and cheap transactions, since they aren't being used. BCH would have to see the same amount of transactions as bitcoin to prove that they could be fast and cheap.  
BTC blockchain has already grown more than 3GB larger than the BCH blockchain since the fork while BCH has 300 blocks more.

just wait for more confirmations.  
a 51% can't steal your coins, it can only censor transactions or double spend a transaction (if the attacker is the sender). so as long as you wait for enough confirmations so that the amount you are receiving is less than the cost of a double spend (for that duration), you're golden.

Transactions are basically a proof of ownership and transfer.  
When he does the transaction it is public. You can copy paste it so to speak. And resubmit it as often as you like.  
Just because it got dropped it doesn't mean it isn't valid any more.  
Additionally if it's worth it to you, you can do child pays for parent.  That means that you spend the unconfirmed transaction with another transaction with an higher fee.  You could also consolidate a lot of payments this way.

It never hurts to take some profits when your investments go up.  But regarding timing the market and regretting not selling at 20k these questions might help you.  
  
Do you regret not selling at 20 USD.  
  
What would have happened if you sold at 20k and it went up to 30k. Would you have bought back in?  
  
Why aren't you selling now? It might drop more.

worst case scenario is you lose 100%. happens every day. Hacked account, lost keys,...  
It's childish taking out loans to "invest". Especially when you got the money otherwise. You are taking on more risk because you're greedy.  
It only works out if nothing goes wrong. good luck. don't give shitty advice to other people who are easily impressionable by the recent btc gains.

The premise is that an algo change causes decentralisation. I'm saying there is no reason for an algorithm change to cause more decentralisation.  
The big players will just buy graphic cards to mine at first.
And develop new Asics in the meantime.  
It would probably increase centralization since Bitmain will be the only one that can afford to develop new miners.

on the one hand you have a multi purpose device that is prone to have hundreds of vulnerabilities. that is built to connect and expose the device to third parties without the explicit knowledge of the user. that is closed source.  
on the other hand you have a one purpose device. open source. offline. user controllable.

do you have to pay interest?  
friend had the same mindset when getting student loans.  
he got fucked gloryfull by the banks. still paying back the loan.  
interest amount is fucking insane.  
student loans are constructed so you'll borrow more than you need and in those 30years you might pay back more in interest alone than the borrowed amount.

Did a dozen transactions this week. Cost 1-15 cents each.  
I had to use rbf to bump fee for one transaction because the fee wasn't high enough for the required priority.  
When I don't need the transaction to confirm within an hour, I just put in 1sat/byte fee.  
@_date: 2018-07-07 19:11:37

at the current rate we woudn't reach an average block size of 1.5MB with larger simple block size limits. It's difficult enough to reach 1MB at current block sizes since the mempool isn't filling up fast enough.

What do you mean with "transaction was approved instantly"? Were you using lightning?  
On chain transactions get mined every 10 minutes on average.  But it's random and can take seconds or in rare occasion up to an hour or longer.

That's why we have decided on good practices around different types of wallets. One being, always sweep paper wallets when spending from them. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 07:50:42
It's best practise to use a new address for each incoming transaction.  
Therefore every current wallet will generate/show a new receiving address after receiving that first payment.

@_date: 2018-04-25 16:59:39
it looks like someone is intentionally pushing 100sat/byte transactions to pump the fees
@_date: 2018-04-20 06:42:37
Did it predict the top perfectly?
@_date: 2018-04-25 21:39:35
I don't know. But it just doesn't seem natural.  
Someone is creating a ton of 100 sat/byte transaction without there being the need for such high fees. (Skipping 1-99 basically)  
  
One reason would be to force higher fees onto the network. Several players could benefit from that. Like miners or a competitor that needs high fees to support their case.  
  
Another reason could be incompetence or the cost of the transactions don't matter at all to the creator.  
@_date: 2018-04-28 17:49:55

The mining difficulty adjusts so that there is a new block every 10 minutes on average.
@_date: 2018-12-16 08:23:35
I don't understand the question.  
But you are making a lot of assumptions.  
Hash power has increased exponential in the past (it's down only for short periods). There have been two halvenings already.  
The number of transactions does not correlate to hash power.  
Miners don't facilitate transactions.  Miners only include them in the blocks. The number of blocks is limited/controlled with the difficulty to have an average of a block every ten minutes.
