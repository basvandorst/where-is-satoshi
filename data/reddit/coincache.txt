No no no no! We use a custom built linux based OS. I am saying that, you (the people) can still use a Linux live disk or the internal sandbox OS with that untrusted PC (to play/use/erase the block). That would make sense.

You want more information? Ping me up in PM's.

May I help you, sir? :)

Yet, can be considered secure. Partial source code is included in the Kit you buy from the site.
@_date: 2014-02-03 09:57:54
We'll consider a change. Thanks for your inputs! :)
@_date: 2014-02-03 16:01:47
If you don't have a trusted system, the block itself has a sandbox OS, but again that's like trusting us again. Better idea, use a linux live disk to do it? 
@_date: 2014-02-03 09:57:22
The coin? It's a Bitcoin storage block. Not a new alt-coin. :)
@_date: 2014-02-03 14:44:51
It does not have a wireless card, only Ethernet is supported, for security again.
OS doesn't store anything, just the wallet. You can just backup the wallet file and erase the full drive using the desktop software and add the wallet again. Simple, easy!
@_date: 2014-02-02 17:02:35
It does not have the code for the complete OS, not how it manages the wallet, nor the encryption. It has source code for the part which can be seen by anyone.
@_date: 2014-02-04 09:52:25
Because it's the block that stores your coins, protects them from unwanted access. Plus, with the block, you can access the coins anywhere, with any PC or just store the coins!

We **only** have Bitcoin as a payment option. We love Bitcoin.

Those photos are of real units. :P
Anyways, if you want more, I'll just go to the factory or the distribution chain tomorrow or in a day and post photos of the units with people!

Bitcoin is volatile, and you have to agree with me on this. There are 100s of Bitcoin stealing malware out there on the internet. So we though of making something that is simpler than any other Bitcoin cold storage. What's easier that just sending coins to one place? Nothing probably. That's what CoinCache is. Simple way to store Bitcoin.
About open development, there's a reason why our OS is not open-source. There might be people who could find exploits in there. Our team is constantly working on testing the OS, we release an update to the OS every 2 week cycle to keep it up to date. There's also a critical push whenever there's a fix for something critical. The software can be updated OTA or with desktop software.

Just PM me, if you have any questions or queries. :)
@_date: 2014-02-02 10:32:12
The software is audited by NetBlack Securities, Titania and OS is audited by G-Data.

You trust yourself? That's enough. The block doesn't need Internet connection, ever. It's just made to store coins. (You can still update the blockchain inside, with desktop software, or just placing the files)
About the Drive, same is true. If you think there's a backdoor inside, just don't connect to the internet, you can still update the blockchain (if you want) by just putting the .dat files in the /blockchain/ folder in the drive.

Okay. 
@_date: 2014-02-02 15:27:59
The complete source code ain't available publicly. (That could create a security risk). Tough, partial source code to some binaries is included in the kit when you buy it.
@_date: 2014-02-03 16:02:10
Sure! Just tell you what you want to know, I'll be glad to reply.
@_date: 2014-02-02 10:59:44
Buy it. Break it. Take 110% of your money, still keep the unit. :)
We have done 100's of things to make it secure. It's almost impossible to break it. You can break it? Challenge accepted. I'd like to be defeated, for the sake of making it more secure.

Hi there, I am glad you found this. Tough, we intended to launch it tomorrow but since you have found it, we are going public today!

I totally agree that no one in the Bitcoin community is trustworthy, but hey there are people who can be trusted. That's why we have Blockchain.info and CoinBase.
If you buy it, you'll see that we have included (one full page) message and some more things. That includes a guarantee, if you find a flaw with the system, we'll return 110% of your money and you can keep the unit too. 
We can guarantee that because our team is working hard, plus we have our auditors and testers working. With each new update, it goes stronger.
