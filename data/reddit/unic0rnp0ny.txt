True. But If you ever want to transfer anything OUT of that address, you'll have to fully sync the client before you can do anything. If it's out of sync, no transactions after the date that it's been synced to will show in the wallet.

The post-it, IMHO, wasn't there to convince people to use it. It was there to get people who hadn't heard of it before then to simply take notice of it. If I had never before heard of Bitcoin and then saw that post-it on the subway, I would then most likely be getting on Google as soon as I could and doing a search to find out more about what it was. I had never personally heard about Bitcoin until somebody happened to mention it in passing in a thread on 4chan a couple years ago. It piqued my curiousity, I did a Google search, learned more about it, and then decided that I liked it and wanted to try it out. Now I own my own mining gear and have been in the game ever since. That's how stuff like that works. You'll never know about it unless you hear about it first.

For more information about how and why Bitcoin works as a currency and means of transferring value, you should read the Bitcoin white paper. These are Satoshi's own words and nobody can, or ever has explained it better than him.  
The reason it's not a stock is because there is not a single entity issuing shares of it. Bitcoin is issued or "mined" (the technical term for creating new coins) in much the same process that gold is dug out of the ground, albeit electronically and with complex mathematical equations. The math involved also happens to be what Bitcoin is backed by and guaranteed with (to put it VERY simply). Anybody can mine bitcoins and no special license is required to do so nor are there legal regulations governing the process.

Congratulations, you have your first network confirmation. Your bitcoin can now be spent anywhere you want to spend it, quite unlike a credit card or paypal where you would have to wait for 24 hours or more (up to 21 days in the case of paypal if they decide they want to hold onto the money for some reason) to be able to spend it. Now, as a means of transferring funds, tell me that Bitcoin isn't better than paypal.

People that don't know about it to begin with will NEVER use it. So, yes. I do want more people to know about it. Because knowing about it leads to people learning about it which leads to people using it. Even with a legitimate advertisement, which costs (let's face it) a lot of money, you'll generally only get 10% of people to say yes to whatever it is you're advertising. So for every 1,000 impressions, only 100 will buy. That's just plain old Marketing 101. If I can get those same 1,000 people to see my ad without having to spend any money for those impressions, I'm then that much further ahead and can use that same money that I would have spent on the subway advertisement to upgrade my website and improve the overall user experience instead. And a well-rounded website will reach many times more people globally than the simple (local) subway ad that will only reach people that use that specific train ever will. However, that single ad on the subway is the first step in getting people to see my website and learning more about the product I have to offer. Not to mention, word of mouth is an amazing thing. 10 people may see my little post-it, learn about what it is, and then they'll tell 10 people about this little post-it that they saw on the subway and THEY'LL want to learn more. Eventually, some of those people will start to buy in and invest in what I have to offer. They'll tell their friends about this glorious thing called Bitcoin, and their friends will want to get in on it. A single ad on a subway, whether it's professionally-made or not, isn't going to convince the entire world to use this thing called Bitcoin. But it's the first step in doing so. And a professional ad campaign doesn't guarantee success. Just look at what happened to Pets.com. They had an amazing advertising campaign but went bust within their first year of being in business.

The idea is, if coins are stolen, you can alert the exchanges and they either won't accept the coins or they'll hold them without giving the bad guy his money when he tries to sell them, effectively causing those coins to be completely useless to him or anybody he may try to give them to. To my knowledge, this has happened several times in the past as a result of some of the exchange hacks that have occurred.

At this point in the game, unless everybody else turns off their mining rigs altogether, controlling 51% of the network hashrate will never be "cheap" OR "easy." And even if someone were to gain the 51% advantage, they would only have control of the network until 2% more hashing power popped up somewhere else causing the attacker to lose the advantage. A 51% attack would likely last mere seconds, possibly minutes at the most. To do any real damage to the network, though, the attacker would likely have to control something more like 70% of the entire network. Only then and with that much hashing power would they have a long enough period of time and enough power to successfully inject their malicious "false chain" into the network and allow it to actually propagate to the remaining nodes. Even if such an attack could be successfully perpetrated, the attacker would not be able to create "counterfeit coins" or spend coins that didn't originally belong to them. All they would be able to do is withhold certain blocks and transactions from propagating to the rest of the network and possibly sneak a number of double spends into the blockchain (which could easily be rolled back if necessary by doing a hard fork of the blockchain)(FYI - double spends happen more often than you might think). Unless the purpose of such an attack was strictly malicious in nature and to hurt the integrity of the network, it would not be to the benefit of the attacker to spend so much time and money amassing enough hashing power to do so, and it certainly wouldn't bring them any direct financial gain.
And all of this is not taking into account the fact that the Bitcoin network will AUTOMATICALLY go into safe mode whenever it detects (on its own) that there is something seriously wrong within the network.

Satoshi has moved coins in the past. Block  to be specific. Why he moved them is a matter of speculation. He could have been giving them away as a promotional gift, selling them, or just moving them to a different wallet. We'll probably never know why he moved them, but he did nonetheless.
I agree with your  possibility for the rest of his coins, though. My personal guess (and elaboration on your argument), however, is that he's saving them to will to his family as an inheritance. When he dies (if he isn't already dead), I'm sure we'll see his coins start to move. And on the flip side of that... when his coins start to move, we'll know he's dead.

I've seen it happen several times. In fact, I used to work support for one of the major exchanges (I won't say which one), and if someone had legitimate evidence that they had coins stolen from one of their accounts on another exchange, we would keep an eye out and if those specific coins got deposited onto our exchange, we would hold them so they could get them back. It mostly happens in the case of larger thefts, though, when an exchange gets hacked. Those coins get flagged and become completely useless to whoever stole them.

Why would a headline cause the price to change? Because people react to negative news about the market. And they react quickly and without doing any research about it first.

SELLSELLSELLSELL! Wait... what? They're not banning it? It was just a rumor? Oh, damn..." Because it's still so young and unstable, people tend to react to negative reports, false information, and rumors much more sharply than they ever react to positive news that's actually real and substantiated. Negative news spreads like a global wildfire and does so within minutes, while positive news sometimes takes days to propagate to the masses. It's just how things go in the BTC economy.

I am one of those people without a bank account. I am neither a housewife nor a luddite. I am a college-educated, free-thinking adult male. I am not out to "change" or "destroy" the system. But I have made the personal choice to forego the traditional banking system because I feel it is fundamentally flawed. 
Why would I choose to use a system that charges me a fee to access my own money? Why would I choose to use a system that, at any moment, could collapse under it's own weight and leave me without access to the money that I gave that same system control over in the first place? The answer is: I would never choose these things. If anybody else feels differently, that is their prerogative. I have made the decision for myself and myself alone. 
There is absolutely no way I can EVER incur charges by overdrawing my pocket, because it's simply not possible to overdraw my pocket. And there is certainly no chance of me ever being charged a fee to use the money I have in my pocket nor will I be charged a fee to hold my money in it. My pocket has absolutely zero bureaucratic control over the money I keep in it and it will never collapse under it's own weight or the weight of regulations put on it. I control the money I have in my pocket and nobody can or ever will be able to tell me otherwise. The decisions I have made I did not come to lightly, and have come to said decisions over many years of deliberation and being a pawn to the system I speak of. I will not ever again be a victim of the American banking system.

This is exactly why I like to email encrypted copies of my private keys to myself.

Which bank? Bank of America, Chase, Wells Fargo, etc. (The big guys) If you don't use THEIR ATM, you get charged $1.95, sometimes up to $3.95 per transaction, just to pull money out. Getting a printed statement out of a BoA ATM costs another dollar on top of the transaction fee if you pull money out at the same time. And I forget which one it is off the top of my head right now, but I'm pretty sure it's BoA that now charges a monthly fee if you want to go inside and talk to a live teller.
Investment accounts - Many people living in the middle and lower classes don't have enough money to feel comfortable investing it in CD's and mortgage-backed securities and whatnot. And investing said money often requires a time commitment of many months where they can't access those funds without having to pay a penalty (both to the bank and to the IRS) for taking the money out early.
Travelling/high crime areas - That's what traveler's checks are for. If a traveler's check gets stolen, it can easily be refunded/replaced by the company that issued it.
It's not that I fear the banks. It's that I don't trust them. You don't have to understand my logic and I really shouldn't have to explain it to you. But my logic stems from the fact that I have been screwed over by banks many times in the past. They reserve the right to close your account for any or no reason. That has happened to me. And in the process, they took and kept the money that was left in my account. I was, quite literally, robbed by my bank  and there was nothing I could do about it. It wasn't because I was overdrawn for too long or doing anything suspicious with my accounts. I had been using my accounts like any normal, red-blooded American would. To this day, I still haven't found an exact reason why they did so. They just did it. So, for those reasons and the ones stated in my previous post, I will never put my money or my trust in a bank ever again.

The dollar does the same thing. You just don't notice it as readily (or we've become desensitized to it at the very least). Generally, the only places you'll really notice the fluctuation of the dollar are at the gas station and the grocery store (in the dairy aisle more specifically). The price of gas doesn't fluctuate because it's becoming more or less expensive to produce. It's because the value of the dollar is fluctuating.

And I actually do use BTCjam on a somewhat regular basis. What's nice about them is, as a borrower, you're allowed to set your own interest rates and payment terms and whether or not you want your loan to be linked to the dollar or not. And if lenders find your loan listing to be unappealing, they just won't fund it. When/if that happens, you can then resubmit the listing with different terms or you can reword the listing slightly in order to make it more palatable for the lenders. It's not like a traditional credit card company that will just extend you credit, and then (sometimes without notice) change your terms on you only for you to discover those changed loan terms on your next monthly bill after you've already spent the money. From my point of view, p2p loan funding is a lot more manageable than accessing credit via traditional credit card companies.

I just looked up both addresses you gave via blockchain.info and the checksum does not validate for either of them. If you were sending them from an exchange, try contacting their support team and ask them to run the RPC command 'repairwallet'. It may work to get your coins back or it may not. If you know the specific transaction hash for your transaction and it does not yet have any network confirmations, you can also try using  They work by sending a conflicting transaction through the blockchain that attempts to invalidate the original one. Chances are high, however, that you just burned your coins and will never be able to retrieve them. For future reference, I might suggest you first send a very small amount (like 0.005 or 0.01 BTC) to test if the receiving address works before sending the full amount. Also, don't ever physically type in a wallet address. It's too easy to make a simple typing mistake. Copy/paste will eliminate any potential for typing errors on your part. Best of luck.

CC use is absolutely not free. By using a credit card to pay for something, you then have to pay interest to the CC company on top of what you originally spent every month until that balance is completely paid off. And, unless you pay off your entire balance every month (in which case, you might as well just be using cash or a debit card), some companies charge as much as 20-30% in monthly interest for giving you the "privilege" of carrying a balance on their cards. And god forbid you ever happen to miss or be late on a payment. Then those companies get to charge you a late fee on top of jacking your interest rate (often without notice) AND possibly negatively affect your consumer credit score (which can stay with you for years into the future). Using Bitcoin, you will NEVER even have to think about paying as much as a CC company will charge (and that's calculating in Coinbase's purchase fees). With Bitcoin, there is no such thing as carrying an outstanding balance and, hence, no such thing as interest charges or late fees, and no such thing as "wrecking your Bitcoin credit." If those reasons alone aren't compelling enough to opt in to Bitcoin over using a traditional credit card, I don't know what is. Not to mention, certain companies that have been starting up recently now have, what you might call "traditional," plastic debit cards that can be funded using bitcoins, allowing you to spend them at brick and mortar stores that otherwise wouldn't accept BTC and also allow you to withdraw the dollar value in cash at any ATM.

If you only find something to be worthy of investing in strictly by how much money is put into it's advertising campaign, then I really don't know what to tell you. But take into consideration that Bitcoin is not a corporate entity with large amounts of money to put into advertising. Bitcoin is not a corporation, period. It is a network of users without any form of centrality. And as such, guerrilla strategies and grass-roots marketing are, as of yet, the only way to spread the word about it. If I had the money to create a professional ad campaign for it with television commercials and subway ads and all those other fancy-schmancy things, I would do it. But, alas, this isn't the case. Bitcoin is still in it's infancy and the companies that do exist to support it are still just starting up for themselves and are doing the best they can with the existing funds they have to advertise themselves (most of which entails as much free advertising as they can get via the internet and anywhere else they can get it).

You do realize that when bitcoin was created (and for the first year or so), it had absolutely zero monetary value, right? That being said, there would be nothing for him to have been able to diversify into with it at that point. And the only BTC that we know that he's ever moved are those from Block  Everything else is still intact and has never been moved.

Hey, if you don't want to help others, that's fine by me. Just don't insult me in the process of your own greed and self-absorption.

OP here. Just thought I'd mention that it wasn't me who got scammed by this person. It was a friend of mine who invested in him. I merely posted this as a service to others to act as a warning against doing business with him.
