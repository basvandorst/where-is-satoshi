Favorite moment of 2015 - seeing upwards movement again!
Hoping for in 2016 - larger blocksize limit!

Make sure to pay $1 worth of bitcoin in tithing or you'll get expelled :p

RingPlus already has them beat in the US... They're a Sprint MVNO

Looks like the MAS version is clean, the rest aren't...
@_date: 2014-02-07 16:18:31
Be careful; it seems like making a hacked blockchain ipa that sends transactions to an address would be a great get-rich-quick scheme for somebody with a little technical knowhow and lack of morals... Somebody needs to calculate the md5 (or sha256 - more thematically appropriate) of the official ipa, so the download could be checked..

Is there an iOS version? 
@_date: 2017-02-09 18:16:33
Yes, I'll take potential attacks over actual stagnation the 1MB is causing.  
@_date: 2017-02-10 01:06:52


Only in the most optimal-for-segwit-transaction case, which won't be most of them.


...exactly what I'm all for.  Right now, Core dictates, and discussion by the users is suppressed in many channels (including this one).


...I think it's about 80% adoption from being "ready to go" :p


I'm hearing a few talking points in your post parroted as well..

There's no definition of *complex* that applies more to changing a single temporary variable set in 2010 than to some 5,000 changed lines of code
@_date: 2017-02-09 19:09:28
- Closer to 1.7
- Even 2MB isn't enough for current equipment
- Is more laying the groundwork for permissioned blockchains than a true scaling solution
- Is very complex

If that fork was proposed, I'd sell all my bitcoins and never use bitcoin again...

I think Craig is full of shit, I don't like Roger Ver, and I still support BU.

No Paycoin? Vegas is showing Miami how it's done!!

Unfortunately, it has everything to do with the tech.  Much like any system based on democracy requires an informed public voting to function correctly, a decentralized system requires anyone running a node in the system be informed about what/why they're running what they're doing - if "the tech" is a single implementation controlled by a few strong-willed developers, the tech represents nothing more than one side of a 'spat'.


Except for delayed payouts, price drops, etc..  


The 'little tweak' is a temporary anti-spam measure introduced in 2010 - six years ago! - with the intention of being removed or scaled up to match technological increases.  The fact that that little tweak has not been fixed, but used to transform the original vision of a decentralized currency into a settlement-layer only does and *should* have an impact on the market cap!


..and when it's worked itself out the door, I'll start getting excited about the technology again, just as I was years ago.


I understand plenty, including the need to resort to ad-hominem attacks right out of the gate. 
@_date: 2016-01-22 05:29:10
For years I would have said yes... but right now, with blocks full, rampant censorship amongst the largest public facing btc forums, and RBF, I'd say nope - wait and see.
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:31:11


Guess they should have used the lightning network instead :/
@_date: 2016-01-28 20:36:14
Of course, I also seem to remember Satoshi saying something about MAX_BLOCKSIZE being temporary and should be raised...
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:06:08
So if you'd gotten more responses you were hoping for, would you have accused your supporters of doing multiple votes and call it meaningless?  
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:29:04


If you want more beermoney-turned-bitcoin like that, give [UserTesting]( a shot... 
(We just do payments with paypal :/ Can't do bitcoin payments because of transaction fees in the cramped blocks)
@_date: 2017-03-10 15:44:29
Somebody == Blockstream
@_date: 2016-01-22 06:45:37
Instead of a single silk road, now there's dozens of competing sites... I wouldn't trust of any of them personally, but there's still plenty of "ebay for drug" action going on - I'd image as long as any cryptocurrency survives in any form, that will be the case.  
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:12:20
IMO it's best not to do that, period.  And running bitcoin software that doesn't support the business interests of Core's funding is NOT a 51% attack.

I wholeheartedly support BU, and no one's ever sent me a check.  
@_date: 2017-01-30 00:22:54
I didn't see any option for "tomorrow" or "about two years ago" so I voted summer 2017
@_date: 2015-08-17 19:18:14
I don't see anything that provides proof - no PGP signature, no signed transaction, nothing but an old email address hijacked by someone with a vastly different writing style.
@_date: 2015-08-17 19:05:38
There is nothing in those two links to support that it is a legit message.
@_date: 2015-08-20 18:39:14
"Raising the blocksize limit to 8kb would prevent regular people from running a full node! Only massive mining conglomerates can afford that kind of storage!" - some guy in this alternate reality.

Thanks for the responses guys... since I have the card, and since the electric bill is included in my rent so it doesn't matter how much power I use, sounds like I'll join a pool and see if I can generate enough for a sandwich now and then...
@_date: 2015-11-05 14:26:00
Until it's fixed.
@_date: 2015-10-08 14:33:57
What states can you use the exchange from?
@_date: 2017-05-09 19:47:52
Or about 300 coffees after fees to get in the artificially full blocks :/
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:17:38
13 coins?
@_date: 2013-10-19 00:16:08
No recent trades??
@_date: 2013-11-23 18:25:08
Where takes credit card payments for bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:25:32
Ooh, 13 types of coins, haha... Read OP like the exchange had 13 BTC :P
Maybe phrase it "13 types of coins", or "bitcoin and 12 scamcoins" :p
@_date: 2013-12-02 00:00:15
Well that's not a hard choice.. 
I should go vanity gen 1John316 :p

If I didn't live in a backwards-ass state where it's illegal to buy wine online, I'd totally buy a bottle of something from you guys!

Stop what you're doing, close any running programs, and look into data recovery software... the file most likely exists still, you'll just have to 'undelete' it.

 About as possible as getting struck by lightning at the exact moment you win the lottery... while hearing good Nickleback song on the radio.
It *could* happen... but it won't.
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:04:06


..and even that's not as bad as the ones that start out with "Bitcoin is a virtual currency.."
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:03:13
No, but I certainly don't mind an exchange relying on Amazon or another cloud provider.
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:50:42


Bitpay fiat's it up instantly, if a business wants to accept BTC without actually dealing with BTC they can now..
@_date: 2013-12-15 01:13:44
Holy shit, is that real?
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:13:50
You mean like  ?
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:27:41
Do a full-system search for wallet.dat...
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:12:12
What site is that screenshot from?
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:19:11
Unless the heat death of the universe comes first... In fact, my money's on that happening just before Nickleback has a good song, never mind the rest of the odds.
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:18:17
It's not too late to get in guys! Last week I bought 5 BTC, and now I'm retired!
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:27:26
If you just download and install bitcoin-qt, it will download all the transactions in a 10GB chunk...
Or you can explore them with blockchain.info
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:34:50
'fraid not, that's the C++ source code that handles dealing with wallets...
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:31:37
On Mac or Linux, do:   
       sudo find / -name wallet.dat    
On Windows... dunno, hit the Windows key, or click where the start button used to be?
