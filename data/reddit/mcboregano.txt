And you wouldn't say people here are trying to sabotage bcash?
@_date: 2018-01-13 06:47:13
Monero, Litecoin is almost exactly the same, Ethereum, Verge, Zcash, Dash... Just to name a few. Also many of these aren't vulnerable to the 51% attack that Bitcoin is. I'd say do more research.

I don't own any Verge nor do I particularly support it I was just reminding him it exists lol

@_date: 2018-01-13 07:08:17
I'd say the some security flaws you mention have more to do with infrastructure development for applications on top of the token system, of which Bitcoin has a very limited amount.
But I agree with your points.
I'd just disagree on the extent to which bitcoin is "superior"

I'm sorry I don't like bcash either but to r/bitcoin it's like fucking facism and Rodger Ver is Hitler.

This is actually a perfect comparison. Java dependencies are large and slow. Ask almost any programmer and they will tell you that it's extremely inefficient but entirely *functional*. There are languages out there that do everything it does and faster or smaller, but it's so widespread that it's the backbone of the interactive internet. Don't underestimate the power of a majority userbase.

I think Bitcoin and Ethereum can exist in the same future. If Bitcoin as a store of value sticks around then it wouldn't necessarily interfere with the success and adoption of Ethereum as a framework that is used for various purposes.

"I assure you I do...," I sigh heavily, peering over my piles of theory. Mark Fischer and Kropotkin lay open on my desk.
  
"But wait, isn't it lefty to accuse other lefties of being frauds? Maybe I'm the fraud. No, it's the other one who is not a true lefty."
  
I pick up my phone and start to type. The portrait of Lenin on my wall stares down at me while a Zizek lecture plays softly in the background.
  
My fingers start moving. The letters paste themselves in my reply box as I chuckle to myself.

Your first mistake was posting this here. It's too late. This was bound to happen once, pardon my language, "normies" started flooding in due to the big pump last December. A bunch of young Redditors interested in getting rich quick with no understanding of distributed ledgers. It's just politics. This sub is full of sneetches with stars on their bellies. The other sub is full of sneetches without.
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:28:52
It isn't "missing," dude. I don't think they ***lost*** it, clearly. But I find it very hard to believe they couldn't "find" it if they wanted to. They knew exactly where that money was going and they didn't want ***us*** to know.
  
Edit: watch out threads full of NSA. I just assume because why else would you spend so much effort defending the US government lol
@_date: 2019-05-27 20:06:58
Thanks for calling me dumb and gullible.
  
It's great that good old "Donal" is such a man of people.
  
If there is one thing I know about the American government for sure, is that pointing out a problem fixes it immediately! No extra effort is required!
Remember when Obama **literally agreed** with me about shutting down Guantanamo Bay? The president himself, and not just the Secretary of Defense? Remember how that turned out?
  
Maybe good old "Donal" really does want to fix it. Does it mean it'll get fixed? Hell no!
  
Another thing: real-world example.  
I used to work at a restaurant that brought in a lot of money. The owner was always throwing around thousands of dollars for renovations and upgrades. $30,000 on a brand new security system. But our point-of-sale computer system was more than 10 years old. I asked the general manager why if the restaurant had the money for upgrades we did not upgrade our computers. He informed me that the owners did not want to update because they knew how to obfuscate profits in the old system so that they could cheat on their taxes.
  
If random restaurants do it, and you don't believe the government is doing it, I think you might be the gullible one here.
@_date: 2019-05-27 20:22:48
Maybe he will. Maybe he won't. I don't know, I'm not God.
  
All I am is a guy with absolutely no faith in our government.

@_date: 2019-05-26 23:27:41
I should have used a different word than "find" but I did also put it in quotes for a reason.
   
If the incompetence of government bookkeeping worked as a detriment to the system it would have been fixed. When a company "improperly tracks" millions of dollars it makes it very difficult to make accurate business decisions.
  
When the government "improperly tracks" millions of dollars it makes it very difficult for politicians to make accurate appraisals of government spending and for people to fully understand where the money is going.
  
One of these results has much more utility than the other.
