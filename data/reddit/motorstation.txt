I trust in 8600 support, now waiting to btc to go up.
@_date: 2018-03-15 10:06:31
Good morning for the new incomers, hope you are in the little train too.
@_date: 2018-03-15 08:45:15
I didnt sell, show me your love now Btc.i deserve it. (Bouhouhou ;p)
@_date: 2018-03-09 09:34:26
1 day chart.Big red lolilol knives.Don't know when they will hit the floor and stop to cut the cake.But we all know what happen after a movement in one direction, the other come next. The question is when now, that's all.Anyway, those who are selling like that and making it going down know that it's not in their interest to push it too more down or they will break our toys and no one will want to play with.I'm waiting to buy more, hesitating to wait more to be honnest, and i'm still holding old BTC that are in red now with this price, but no way i would sell them now, it would be ridiculous.
@_date: 2018-03-15 14:00:53
Hope you are not all dead far on the top of your moutains holders, there is still hope !;p
@_date: 2018-03-13 09:47:19
Let's push it now or let it die.Give me want to reinject fiat show me you still alive btc.
@_date: 2018-02-28 08:42:31
What is this shitty drop....Will just hold for now, tired to see this.
@_date: 2018-03-01 13:50:40
Feel free to ask for some alcohol, food, women, what you need.Enjoy travel in train of happiness.Be aware that we can encounter some irregularities on the railway, then stay strong, just hold something to not fall.Be sure that we will arrive to destination, taking time it will need.
@_date: 2018-03-06 11:48:50
Dont miss the next train when it will leave the gare. &lt;3
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:45:58
Here come the FUD boys, where were you hiding ?
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:46:36
Dont take it as granted, it will probably move down again, wold prefer to be wrong you know, but...
@_date: 2018-03-06 10:01:42
Dont worry be happy ! Hello all in BTC we trust.
@_date: 2018-03-13 12:46:20
Hope you are not in atm guys
@_date: 2018-02-23 12:48:30
Green time.
@_date: 2018-03-05 16:05:45
Don't worry be happy second edition. Just have to wait to enjoy, all is fine with our friend BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:07:24
To the wall, we trust in you little BTC.
@_date: 2018-03-01 10:20:58
Are you speaking in euros ? Mostly speaking in USD here. Do you want to trade ? Or to hold ? If you think BTC will rise more then buy now and hold then sell later.If you think it will go down wait and buy when the price will be lower, but if it continues to rise it's missing and opportunity.
I have BTC i hold, and some i trade, it's up to you to decide.
@_date: 2018-03-07 11:32:40
Fud army spotted. Bulls where following a woman wearing a red robe, they will come back. Bears had enough honney for now.
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:59:13
I wish you good luck, i trust in it too, will probably buy more as well.
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:55:37
I'm not a "pro" trader, but was able to make benefit with Daily trading with BTC, not a lot but decent amount.
But is was easier before, with higher volume, now i prefer to hold instead of be focusing on it all the time.i'll probably trade again in few weeks when BTC will be more high, but for now brain hollydays and easy hold. :)
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:15:31
It will probably go as low as today in the next few days + chinese new year guy.. Nice to read optimistic people but dont forgot how it was falling since yesterday. In this case no wall can avoid the fall.
@_date: 2018-03-01 12:05:55
Little BTC, make us proud in march.
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:47:26
To be simple : Bull : you more think it will go up, more positive, bear is the contrary.
Both can have traps...like false rise or downtrend.
Can't say to you what to do with your money i can't predict future.
Ask you this ; Do you trust in BTC, and more precisely do you think it will go more up ? If yes then perhaps it's time to buy...
If you think BTC is at his nearly max value, then wait and buy when it will be lower.
Personnaly i think it will go up, play safe, check all charts (not only 1min but all) and make your decision, hope you'll do the right one.
@_date: 2018-02-23 09:50:08
We are friday and we just out of the red candles of the two last days, i dont expect a massive sellout before evening.
I think it will grow slowly.
On what are you basing your analyse ?
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:31:12
@_date: 2018-03-06 15:28:53
Booooooouuuuummmm &lt;3
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:18:30
I'm sometimes a traitor; i mostly HOLD, except sometimes when i sell to buy lower. Still have old BTC that i hold (no choice was higher price) but for the rest, i sometimes sell and buy again (last time was yesterday). Must admit i prefer to hold even if then cant have more BTC. Wishing you a lot of money :)
@_date: 2018-02-16 12:31:42
Believe what ? That's all is ok ? You tought it would always go up without going down at some moments ? Again all is normal here...
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:21:40
Yes, that's just i still prefer to grow slowly than too quickly, in aim to avoid too heavy corrections
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:33:25
You ironical ? Usually i'm used to trade, but now i'm just holding what i bought recently and i know it will pay. ;)
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:12:01
Indeed it's time to Hold.Or trade if you are good at it, but i would wait few weeks to trade.
@_date: 2018-02-23 12:01:02
Not yet
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:25:37
If you didnt buy when it was really low, you can make profit now and buy back when it will apocalypse fall again, and it will happen.
Then sell again when more high and repeat.
We are not anymore in the november configuration where we were able to let crypto without caring, time of non stop rising is sadly over.
Make profit when its possible, buy when its more low as possible.
Good luck.
@_date: 2018-03-14 11:45:50
Already saw you said it, wish you are right, a bit tired to wait the up movement that still havent came.
@_date: 2018-03-06 08:38:09
In fact, we have to trust that it will go more up, or left now. Personally i stay in ;)
@_date: 2018-03-15 09:00:28
You lost a lot on some of your holds for now ? Stay strong :)
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:11:00
I think yes.Then lower sunday monday and if all is fine growing again slowly during week.
@_date: 2018-03-29 08:14:39
Interesting prices, im hesitating to buy more, am i crazy ?
@_date: 2018-02-12 08:45:59
Dont worry will just add one to balance.
@_date: 2018-02-27 13:16:19
Volume decreasing slowly, 24H % too.Time to wait the next wave, its fading right now.(Can be wrong blabla, dont know truth blabla, but open your eyes ;)
@_date: 2018-02-15 09:55:33
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:59:45
Some holds are in red, but i'm still believing and i refuse to sell, am i alone in this case ? ;p
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:30:49
Dont want to miss the time when it will go up again thats why i still hold.Good luck
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:02:12
Wait dude, it will go down again, per day, there is sometimes one or two big rising, you have to try to not miss it and sell at the end of it. For now its over, perhaps we will have other one in evening but i dont think so. Take care if you buy now that when you go sleep it's not going down.Nowadays not a good period to let your coins on market too long.
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:28:45
Depend at wich price you bought but it's what i did with a part of my BTC, to be able to buy lower at cheaper price, at the end it allows you to earn more BTC.
You can hold your old ones if you prefer, but with more recent boughts it's a good strategie.(I'm still holding my old BTC bought at a more higher price.)
Edit : Wait a decent up to sell, it will probably go down during day and more up later.(11:30 am here).
@_date: 2018-02-26 13:03:12
Funny how the 1OK wall sell vanished on gdax.
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:23:01
Hope you didn't sell because of fear.Train is continuing is travel quietly.Volume is really nice if i compare with few days ago.
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:40:08
Yes ; 8700 !
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:39:28
I would recommand to wait a bit, but who knows.... ;)
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:25:33
I sold, good luck ;)
Edit ; Back in finally, will take the risk, stay safe if you cant lost money.
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:09:47
Will see who is the sucker.
@_date: 2018-02-09 10:27:03
This little bat was fun.
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:59:04
Be careful now
@_date: 2018-02-14 09:03:16
Why are you so sure of a new crash ... ? :/
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:45:11
Dont miss the train..
@_date: 2018-02-23 12:07:21
Nothing personal but i wont listen to you then. ;p
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:31:25
Taken from internet ; The number of shares or contracts traded in a security or an entire market during a given period of time. It is simply the amount of shares that trade hands from sellers to buyers as a measure of activity.
The volume was really low days ago, you can check it depending with plateform you use to trade, it's the 24h volume. Volume rising means that it can be indeed mostly sell, but... with the boughts growing and value of BTC it's really positive right now.If you hold, do not check the chart too often to avoid to sell on emotions.Ask yourself if you trust BTC or not.If yes just hold and wait, and if you are experienced enough, trade daily but with being cautious.
@_date: 2018-02-09 09:54:25
Will see...I love end of week because it's usually rising yep, curious if it will drop as usually or a bit more this time.
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:25:20
Hmm, finally have to be carefull now.
Edit ; I sold, out of the wave atm.Stay safe.
@_date: 2018-03-06 11:27:01
Yes perhaps more, but you know what i meant ;)
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:56:34
I bought again, you can do the same now, thanks in advance. :o
@_date: 2018-02-09 09:18:40
Let's ride a bit &lt;3
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:54:43
Check the 1day chart. You find it optimistic .. ?
@_date: 2018-03-06 10:37:50
Yes, it's not a huge sell off, BTC will continue to rise, its just normal that investers want to take benefits sometimes.
Just sad to see that people are following and selling at the wrong moment instead of selling at top.
For once i'm surprised myself that i'm not grumpy to see it falling a bit.
I just dont care, because im still confident, watch the chart again in 1H ;)
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:56:48
Here we go.It's your turn USA we did our job already
@_date: 2018-02-12 09:13:46
My turn to have a -1 it seems lol.
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:21:15
Wooohooo. Ahem, sorry. ;D
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:46:05
Time to have a bit money back.
@_date: 2018-02-14 11:22:47
Dont know where it will send us, but i'm very very confident about it effects ;)
@_date: 2018-03-08 09:16:47
BTC, you such a little child, you did your little caprice, now time to act like a man. End of the week will be interesting i guess. \O/
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:21:37
Dont miss the next train friends.Good luck !
@_date: 2018-02-07 09:01:46
That's true, its usually full of FUD, or FOMO without a balance between both and it's a bit childish usually.. I find too that it's more and more pleasant to read here.Good luck to you AbleLeg :)
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:30:11
I bought some coins near 7000 too, no way that i would sell it now...Normal that it's going a bit down too...
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:03:08
Good morning USA, it's visible that you are waking up, congrats !
@_date: 2018-03-06 10:22:46
The return of boughts will be funny after this little fall.
@_date: 2018-02-19 13:37:35
Totally agree with what you said. By saying that BTC has already began to rise back i mean right now, these days.The 1D chart is decent of what i see, but indeed it can go down again sadly, that's just that for now i dont see any reason to sell.But indeed, i keep an eye on it because i don't want to be too confident if one day it's going a lot down again.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:33:17
Be careful, like i said it will continue to go down, try to sell at the end of happy boughts pics and buy low.We are not out of the down time take care and dont be too optimistic for now.
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:28:09
Unleash what you want but break this !
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:11:53
It went down before their new year, it's the case each year.Was wondering if during it it will be same, but i think i'll just hold.
@_date: 2018-02-09 15:31:13
I think too it will go a bit down first.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:47:22
Big rise on the way be ready
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:13:26
Anyway you have less fees by passing by Transfer.CC is shitty.
@_date: 2018-02-26 13:27:25
Have to deal with wall manipulations sadly ;p
@_date: 2018-02-14 11:58:10
@_date: 2018-02-27 12:30:13
Leave the wall a dragon is coming ;o
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:14:16
Not really important, if it's not today will be this week end or monday..Little BTC will grow again :)
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:55:41
Yes sadly...Was speaking of 1min chart little train.
@_date: 2018-02-09 09:02:25
Usually going up at the end of the week.I think it can go down next week but clearly not so low.
@_date: 2018-03-06 14:06:19
Hope you bought..
@_date: 2018-02-26 12:19:42
Still holding, will see, tought it would have gone more down but the 1D chart is still decent, i stay optimist.Be happy, don't worry.Happy holding.
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:22:15
Good morning, support us go buy some BTC ;D
@_date: 2018-03-16 09:12:52
Btc is stuck in ass of someone it seems.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:45:09
Be careful all..
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:03:41
Hi all, be brave, strong.
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:32:53
Excellent :)
@_date: 2018-02-16 11:29:45
Stop to worry like that, went up a lot yesterday, normal that it's moving a bit down. Have a good day all.
@_date: 2018-02-28 08:46:28
I know, that's why i will just hold, just don't like to see it ;p
@_date: 2018-02-09 09:39:55
With a 70 % discount on fees \o/
@_date: 2018-02-14 09:34:22
It's evolving nice, curious to see how it will be in few days.
@_date: 2018-02-04 11:17:55
I think it can be interesting to buy today and to sell at the end of the day before to sleep.Then buy tomorrow when sunday will be passed and value down. Hypothetical !!!!! I insist on it to not be deleted.But it's what i'll do.Good luck all.
@_date: 2018-02-21 09:49:45
Don't worry, be happy.
@_date: 2018-02-12 11:22:40
Us, save us, support !
@_date: 2018-02-23 09:14:07
Bought when it was at bottom yesterday, happy to see we are still holding, even if we are not far from where i bought i'm confident now.
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:52:26
Don't worry, be happy ;)
@_date: 2018-03-06 09:15:42
I would buy now, because i'm positive and i think it will continue to grow. It's up to you to take the risk or not ;)
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:11:23
Let's break some shit walls ;D
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:05:37
Will give my advice on it because i had same dilemna with recents BTC i bought.(Still holding old ones) Was trading a bit thos days, 
was decent but nothing extraordinary.Took a lot of time and need to always watch the charts.I decided to hold a bit and now i'm still holding.I was asking myself the same question, and finally here is my answer : I prefer to loose money with trying, than to buy later and loose BTC amount because the prise has rised. i would deal better with frustration of loosing money because too confident than the contrary, i wouldnt deal well by thinking i missed a nice opportunity. Good luck and enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2018-02-19 12:54:59
Why are there still a lot of people thinking it will go down again ? You'll say the same when will have pass 11K, 12K ... ?
BTC has already began is rise back, it's more healthy that it's slow instead of crazy indecent rises.
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:08:02
Guys, not speaking of old ones i hold but about few i bought these days.
Do you think it's better to sell them and buy again during chinese new year while more low, or just hold despite that it will probably go down ? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:22:34
Week end soon with gf so cant trade sadly, be brave all, it will probably continue down and a bit up in few hours.Remember to not let crypto on if you are not near your screen to seel when needed.Good luck friends.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:05:44
Use Gdax then..
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:33:23
Same, i'm not affraid at all, will be better later.
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:17:44
Personally i stay in and hold i still trust in BTC even if it makes me tired to see it moves like that.In other way i clearly prefer down times now and regularly than never and suddenly having a big crash.Don't worry be happy.
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:13:35
If its money you dont need and can lose, i would say buy, its cheap atm.
@_date: 2018-02-23 11:44:41
Alt are in green % time for BTC to arrive in it soon too
@_date: 2018-02-27 12:18:21
To the wall guys, remember the dead at 8700, fight for them ! ahah.
@_date: 2018-02-23 12:04:01
No, wasnt happening, but nice try ;p
@_date: 2018-02-26 14:26:27
Volume is still rising slowly, it's interesting, this week will be too.
@_date: 2018-02-22 10:16:20
Curious how down it will go
@_date: 2018-02-14 10:07:33
Am i alone to be happy with how it's evolving or what ? It can't take 10k in a week...But with how it's evolving aren't you confident ?? :o
@_date: 2018-02-19 14:02:04
Ahaha you trapped me, said like that i can just admit you are right.
@_date: 2018-03-13 12:08:29
Out of trade for now, will jump in back later, nothing interesting at this moment, just dead animal jumps.Good luck.
@_date: 2018-02-07 09:35:44
Im in again will see..
Edit ; I think possible to break the 8k wall i stay in just for the pleasure to do.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:40:16
Thanks. Still holding my old btc bought in past, not the new ones. Feel free to stay in when it's going down, instead of buying more low.
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:03:19
I hope for you that she would be pretty then.Go to see her now because if you go in few weeks it will be more expensive ! ahahah ;p
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:43:00
Considering it has went up since 2 hours..Yes ;)
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:56:23
Bye bye..
@_date: 2018-02-09 13:07:14
Would say couple days.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:43:22
Time to wait till wich lvl it can crash again, atm it's not safe at all to buy.
Like said before, manage to have profits if you can now and then wait to buy after chinese new year.
Hold if you bought long time ago at low price, but sell now if you can have few profit. Cant predict but i'm pretty sure it will go down again, dont be trapped. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 12:15:58
Mine says the contrary, but at one moment or the other we will be both right ahah.
@_date: 2018-02-15 08:25:27
Hm.Decided to stop to trade and to just hold 2 days ago, was a nice surprise when i woke up. BTC was in love with us yesterday, and is still today.;)
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:13:08
Stop speaking of FUD please, just taking time to pass 9K.
Your turn USA.
@_date: 2018-02-23 11:27:53
Will be good day for BTC, and for nerves of the Hodlers.
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:51:56
Stay Strong, trust BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:32:33
Yes, will wait a bit before to buy again.
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:25:02
Volume rising, very exciting.I'll probably buy again to support this fight. Nice valentine day bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-04 10:43:13
A lot of people need to forge their own advice instead of being too positive/negative.Take care of comments you read indeed, but could be interesting too to take in consideration when you read that it's perhaps not the good moment to buy instead of laughing. Note that i putted conditional words. ;)
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:27:41
Was in yesterday wave, still rising atm ;)
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:22:44
Guys, in my opinion do not invest now, just check the lines between the candles if you are new or beginner..Let the bots kill themselves, put your money when it's safe, don't take risk.
@_date: 2018-02-27 11:46:06
Okkkkk next train, let's push it !
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:22:11
Curious to see where it will stop to go down, waiting to the next bull wave.
@_date: 2018-03-14 10:40:02
Ok will buy more, still prefer to lost money than the next train, crazy or not will see
@_date: 2018-02-21 13:15:38
Don't worryyyy and just buy if you haven't yet, see you in few days
@_date: 2018-03-19 13:17:38
Make us proud BTC, time to move up !
@_date: 2018-03-06 12:49:33
Make us proud yanks ;)
@_date: 2018-02-27 09:33:12
Let's break some shit wall guys
Edit ; ok time to be carefull, good luck
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:36:31
Let's break some lolilol orange shit walls.
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:36:40
No ;D
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:59:03
Remember where we came from, stay positive.
@_date: 2018-02-22 10:39:03
Mostly Bullish but i hate that and chart stink.Time to be safe.
