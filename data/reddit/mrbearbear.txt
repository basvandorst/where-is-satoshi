Exactly. No matter what site u log into... Coinbase, binance, bittrex, etc. THEY ALWAYS ASK FOR YOUR 2FA.  It doesn't randomly ask for 2fa, that's not how it works. Either you didn't set up 2fa, or you did something completely wrong.
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:39:04
Wow, literally I was just going to set up a card in a couple of days. Looks like I'll be waiting.
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:56:43
Mother Fuckers!
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:41:14
Hell, .5 is nothing to sneeze at for the average Joe. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:06:00
True, but very unlikely.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:57:41
I'm guessing you are either Laura dimon, Julia dimon, or Kara Leigh dimon.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:22:55
A full Bitcoin is for sure, but I wouldn't say .1 is
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:53:55
Idk about you guys, but it seems to me like everyone wants to know when they will have segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:43:00
Well you sir just earned yourself all the down votes you can get with the "selling your account eventually" comment.
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:28:04
Hello! I'm hoping for one of these for Christmas!
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:52:22
Twitter is just as bad. Only difference is u know whose telling u the fud.
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:47:32
How nice of you r/Pineapplefund ! My recommendation is, try donating to homeless shelters. Alot of them( including here here in Milwaukee) have had their funding cut and are at risk of not being able to provide enough housing to the homeless.ill add some shortly.
@_date: 2018-09-11 18:13:33
Perhaps use earn.com?
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:19:27
I would get the shitty wizard tattoo too lol , I'd rock that!
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:18:40
Congrats! we love you too, and we wish you nothing but the best.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:06:22
Choo choo mother fuckers!
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:42:02
no way! Damn it, how did I miss it?
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:03:36
Bittrex charges that fee as well.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:24:03
U have the fakest account I have ever seen. Your cake day is December 31st, 1969? Only one way that's possible, and I don't even need to say it 
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:13:53
On Gdax pays the fees. On coinbase, they do not.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:21:44
I'm skeptical that it was North Korea. The ransoms they request were mighty low.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:01:47
We really to have an ama with some accountant with crypto currency taxing experience to put this to rest.
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:54:12
I sat on this for a bit, thinking for a response. And you know what... I got one. Come to Milwaukee. Seriously. Live on the streets, RIGHT NOW. Tell me that it's better than being in a shelter. Right now it's 0 degrees. Renting organizations are on a back log as we speak on this state. We rarely open up any rental assistance. Shelters aren't meant to be a place that is fucking awesome. Its a place to be in the shelter from the warmth. I'll take that any day than freezing to death. Edit: beggars can't be choosers. I know u didn't pick this life, but u sure as hell can't tell me u would choose to freeze. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:49:59
I'm assuming they meant to put 2018 , not 2017.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:15:49
Congrats! Make sure to share your wealth , and continue to hodl.
@_date: 2018-09-21 14:56:49
Can't find anything on Google, and his Twitter account has been deleted.
@_date: 2018-09-18 13:43:25
This guy left out a screenshot from the other post  clearly he got scammed. Binance doesn't ask you to use Skype.
@_date: 2018-09-18 13:57:13
You want me to believe you? Post the headers, like everyone has asked you to do. 
@_date: 2018-09-15 17:11:44
As far as we are aware, yes. Obviously we don't know the full story, and now we might never know. Wouldn't be surprised if he comes up dead a few months later.
@_date: 2018-08-03 01:05:17
Well shit, time to go hunting now! Any other hints?
@_date: 2018-05-27 21:23:35
China also had verge listed........ Which lost all credibility. Don't get me wrong, steem was a cool concept, it's just that greed destroyed it.
@_date: 2018-05-11 16:58:54
Because of fear. And we all know what the first letter in FUD stands for.
@_date: 2018-05-12 23:31:29
One thing ledger has over trezor is the amount of cryptocurrencies they support. I'm excited to see their official token support which should be coming soon.
@_date: 2017-02-14 19:05:19
Nano or nano s?
@_date: 2017-02-03 01:02:39
Yea, I was looking for more a blue? 
@_date: 2017-02-14 21:20:40
Will do that thanks!
@_date: 2017-02-14 17:36:21
Pmd you!
@_date: 2017-02-15 00:28:29
O fuck...... Totally didn't realize it! Maybe next project make. Suppppperrrr tiny blue with a touch screen !
@_date: 2017-02-02 17:14:33
Fuck the moon, we need to go to Mars!
@_date: 2017-02-14 19:56:37
I thought that too.... But I really haven't seen much on this sub mention of keepkey.
@_date: 2017-02-14 21:20:25
I kinda wish the nano s had touchscreen support. Thanks for your input! Also there is a combo deal to get both the blue and nano s for a decent price
@_date: 2017-02-28 15:11:08
Make it a mesh hat, and ill get it.
@_date: 2017-02-16 14:02:10
But the quality of said coin in question isn't the best. Usually the ones you see are in much better shape.
@_date: 2017-02-18 18:48:34
Dude was fucking foolish to even pull a knife in a public place.
@_date: 2017-02-22 18:40:59
What the fuck is the point of spamming bullshit transactions like this? 
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:44:56
I'm confused. So are they holding an auction or not? It seems to me they are selling them to coinbase
@_date: 2017-02-12 00:19:19
Jeez u sound like a girl who went on  a date with a  cute boy.
@_date: 2017-02-02 17:59:11
Love this answer right here.
@_date: 2017-02-22 21:22:49
Newbie question , but how are these up for grabs?
@_date: 2017-02-24 20:15:35
Also, look at nano s
@_date: 2017-02-02 18:09:55
Btcc maybe make the hat a different color as well?
@_date: 2017-02-02 15:21:39
Damn beat me to it! I'm also doing Etsy as well. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 21:12:14
Nope! Just make sure to set up your recovery phrase.
@_date: 2017-02-18 18:49:13
Or meet at a police station instead.
@_date: 2017-02-15 02:26:04
I never heard that it was meant for dev only.
@_date: 2017-02-02 18:02:43
Great movie, although so much more could've been said about Satoshi and the little affect these regulations had on consumers. Not to mention they should've mentioned Bitcoin is rebounding.
@_date: 2017-02-04 15:23:12
Ummmmmmmmmmmm is that REALLY the amount needed? 
@_date: 2017-02-02 14:58:31
This is why I'm afraid of getting the Bitcoin hat. People fail at reading and do stupid shit.
@_date: 2017-02-04 18:18:10
I really hope Bitcoin doesn't split. I'm terrified of another ethereum situation
@_date: 2017-02-13 21:30:35
They have been out of stock since last November pretty much with increase demand. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 15:48:18
Oo I'm not OP, I'm just curious why the transaction costs so much. So how exactly can u reduce the cost of fee?
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:52:46
It's been said NUMEROUS times. But people always seem to defend them
@_date: 2017-03-04 18:55:15
100% agree. Voicing views no matter the stance should be allowed.
@_date: 2017-03-01 18:04:44
I would say limit this to times when we see 100$ jumps... Anything lower is something we see on a regular basis.
@_date: 2017-02-03 19:33:04
Alright crypto finally got her response!
"i dont personally gather your payment information. Etsy does. so i never see that private info. i also do not know what bitcoin is but i read a little about it. etsy probably doesnt accept bitcoin bc it doesnt transfer into tangible cash. to be deposited into my bank account."
@_date: 2017-03-08 19:00:31
Of course they aren't. Being a miner you're  looking for one thing, profit. Mining rigs aren't cheap, and the best thing to do is go to mining pool that maximizes profit to get what you paid for.
@_date: 2017-03-13 16:54:55
I too would like to know a safe harbor..... If that even exists.
@_date: 2017-03-27 22:59:33
Still fucking bizarre
@_date: 2017-03-02 17:12:32
Wow, alot more than I thought. This was something I wanted to try from earlier, just didn't know if I should do that 
@_date: 2017-03-12 03:39:35
The license plate! It's clearly a Wisconsin one.edit: not to mention, the area is very similar, seems actually. Close to me.
@_date: 2017-03-11 21:32:55
Hello fellow wisconsinite !
@_date: 2017-03-23 14:36:44
I invested in a hardware wallet when i had 1 BTC. U have 3x as much, so I'd get one. 
@_date: 2017-03-12 22:05:21
That's good to hear. Restoring is actually a bit of a pain in the ass especially when u select the wrong word.
@_date: 2017-03-27 23:37:53
The more I look into this, the more I see a pump n dump. Its value is back to 80 with now Bitcoindark doing the same thing but at a lesser extent.
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:39:23
Didn't ver open a mining pool that yeielded​ higher rewards? That right there is an incentive. If I ever decided to get into mining heavily, my mining would go to where I'm expecting the best returns. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 17:10:46
Hey now whoa whoa. Like I said man, no pressure. It was a genuine question. I apologise, I didn't mean to come off as rude.
@_date: 2017-03-09 23:01:02
Multiple websites now are reporting sec will announce their decision tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-03-27 15:29:55
Nope, looks like ur stuck with either going to one of their reccomended bitcoin ATMs, or using ur bank account.
@_date: 2017-03-12 20:32:41
What does electrum even do? I thought my BTC was safe in the hardware wallet already.
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:53:38
What this comes down to is, does this place a burden on you or not? Many people have invested quite a bit.  I myself have invested for two reasons: saving, and an emergency fund. Worse case scenario I'll be cashing out half, and leave the remaining amount in. Whoever wins the war, Bitcoin will still live on.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:28:46
The Bitcoin world has seen far worse , and bitcoins price shows that.
@_date: 2017-02-06 19:05:16
WTF, ledger is automatically taking out fees now?!
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:32:41
This is good news if he's actually willing to compromise. We might be finally able to end this bu vs core war and actually focus on better things.
@_date: 2017-03-09 22:53:12
Give me some incentive to run a node... Then maybe I would? Data isn't cheap in the states.
@_date: 2017-03-04 18:52:51
No worries guy. Everyone wants the same thing for Bitcoin, to thrive. Edit: why ty :) I truly believe it would be a step in the right direction, if it can actually happen.
@_date: 2017-03-18 01:11:48
Buy the fucking dip!
@_date: 2017-03-04 18:45:10
To have an open discussion, people must be allowed to have a voice. In this discussion, it will clearly show whether or not  they know something, and they will be weeded out. Bashing should not be needed to do so. Edit: prime example, Phrasing. This guy could've just said , can you please post some sources to back up your claims? These kinda comments are what make discussions ugly and fall apart. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 16:03:54
So what have u accumulated now, if u don't mind me asking? No pressure, you can say no.
@_date: 2017-03-10 00:39:07
Not enough, man. As I said before, data is expensive in the states. If I had money to spend freely, this would be a better idea.
@_date: 2017-02-08 19:04:25
Never understood the whole hodl thing.
@_date: 2017-03-02 15:37:17
NOW ladies and gents, we truely reached the high.
@_date: 2017-03-15 23:25:47
Account age aside, they are numerous horror stories from coinbase.
@_date: 2017-03-04 17:57:25
Well honestly the problem is people turn  to name calling , bashing, threats for their views. Those things do not belong in a discussion, as it ruins it. We had a bu vs segwit discussion not to long ago
 It started off fine, then people started calling people assholes , pieces of shit, etc. Then it was removed.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:41:48
This is why numerous state not to buy from coinbase. 
@_date: 2018-10-23 18:12:40
You should've totally had Craig wright as Judas.
@_date: 2018-10-04 22:00:54
Interesting, link?
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:27:52
My ass it is. Prolly due to all the traffic.
@_date: 2018-10-24 16:28:01
Getting stronger! 
@_date: 2018-10-17 19:40:43
It's going to be a waiting game at this point. The question is, who will cave first, USA or China? My money or China. Sure, this holiday season will suck balls, but China needs us more than we need them.
@_date: 2018-10-04 18:04:40
Unfortunately ur stuck waiting until the investigation is done with. Lawyer up and Duke it out, or just wait it out. 
@_date: 2017-01-03 12:11:16
If u weren't located in Australia, I'd buy one from you.
@_date: 2017-01-26 22:43:17
Nope , I'm straight as an arrow. No illegal stuff is tied to account. They truthfully just ignored me like they did with you.
@_date: 2018-10-04 18:09:04
Considering binance isn't in the USA, 4th amendment doesn't mean squat at this point.
@_date: 2018-10-04 18:41:38
Yep, and that's the only thing we have to go off of is a he said, she said. As someone else stated, I doubt binance needs your 1.2k btc, they are fine as it is. Lawyer up, or wait it out. And honestly, please stop posting this until you can give us a legit update.
@_date: 2018-10-04 18:01:50
They pretty much did in the other subreddit. Account is under investigation and they can't comment on it until the investigation is over with.
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:27:23
Yes you can. Pretty much once you  it you'll understand it more. It's like a set number of apps. I think it's 5 or 6 max
@_date: 2017-01-16 15:12:33
I'm honestly believing who ever it was either forgot about it, or lost it.
@_date: 2017-01-15 00:05:20
This same thing right here. I'm always hit with an international pos fee
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:00:51
Yea and it also mentions NOTHING about  why he was arrested.
@_date: 2017-01-03 12:05:11
Please post a how to on how to build one like this!
@_date: 2018-10-04 19:29:25
That's why I said either get a lawyer, or wait it out. There is nothing this community can do for you.
@_date: 2018-10-04 18:13:43
Well, as it stands, complaining on Reddit every day isn't going to make the process faster. Pretty much he has posted in nearly crypto currency subreddit about this issue. Nobody said he was guilty of anything. He has actions he can take, so he needs to do them.
@_date: 2017-01-10 01:42:05
Go to PNC. Never questioned me
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:05:43
Definitely wasn't there before.
@_date: 2017-01-26 21:18:10
 2 fucking months. It's awful, and depressing. I've pretty much given up getting it back. I've started to rebuild, but it's a slow process. 2 BTC might seem much to some, but to me that was alot considering it was a process of  putting 20$ per paycheck .Edit: didn't realize u were the OP. I don't mean to be negative, but at this point I've moved on.  
I tell myself I'm lucky it was a smaller amount, as I've heard of horror stories with much more involved. Good luck to you.
@_date: 2017-01-27 21:59:00
Also completely off subject from my issue and ops, they should be getting shitted on from their international POS fee.
@_date: 2017-01-03 12:10:03
I second that!
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:19:29
Congrats! Still like my nano s, just wish there was more room for more wallets. If this next split happens, I'll have enough storage for another wallet or 2 :(
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:49:33
WTF. The man stops the wanna cry, and the thanks he gets is being thrown in jail?
@_date: 2017-01-25 16:27:24
We're u the guy on MTV who had that shit done?
@_date: 2018-10-04 22:02:06
It's 1200 btc.
@_date: 2017-01-27 03:19:31
Truth. I've been telling people this same thing and giving my warning to others. I insist it's the truth, but alas, it's all I can do. Watching others get into the same issue as me brings me no joy, only more grief.
@_date: 2016-12-11 16:59:35
That's kinda what I'm thinking too. The whole idea that bitcoin was co created makes alot of sense. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:58:50
Literally it'll all depend on the 2x part. Only thing that's making this coin valuable right now.
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:16:32
Problem with bch is on certain days, it's taking hours to confirm a transaction. Sent bch to bittrex, and it took nearly 6 hours. What's the point of using it if we still have a confirmation issue?
@_date: 2016-11-24 13:56:25
I'll hold u to that.
@_date: 2016-12-11 17:04:40
Would you recommend ledger too? Or just trezor?
@_date: 2016-12-09 23:04:08
Same here! My wallet vanished.
@_date: 2017-01-26 20:41:42
This is why I can't bring myself to deal with coinbase anymore. I had shit like this happen to me as well, still hasn't been resolved. I'd rather much go through the trouble of meeting someone in person or using PayPal than to lose 2 BTC again. Edit: why the down votes? this is a huge issue and it's not just me who has em, look em up! I guess people hate facts.
@_date: 2016-12-14 17:20:42
I'm newish to bitcoin, so if you can recommend me a better Wallet, I would appreciate it.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:23:56
People buying in are looking at it like it's "digital gold". That's what is propping up it's price.
@_date: 2016-12-29 23:17:43
Hmmm is it worth it?
@_date: 2016-12-12 00:54:48
It went offline two days ago, same thing happened last time. Turned out they were behind on blocks. I'm in the same boat as you.
@_date: 2019-08-14 17:28:53
I'm more so thinking it was caused by the delays in the tariffs. People were using it as a safe haven since stocks were dropping
@_date: 2016-12-12 11:15:35
Are you located in the Midwest by chance?
@_date: 2019-08-19 20:18:59
To sum it up: no, he didn't reveal anything to prove hes Satoshi.
@_date: 2016-12-29 23:51:10
Hey, I'll take the beer!
@_date: 2016-12-28 11:14:30
Same here! Although it's a 5 dollar bet lol
@_date: 2016-11-24 14:04:06
Sorry to hijack, but how long does it take for a transaction to be dropped and returned?
@_date: 2019-08-07 15:49:28
I expect this to continue the longer the trade war goes on
@_date: 2016-12-22 21:29:18
Well pay it forward and give me 1 BTC ;)
I honestly really could use it.
@_date: 2019-08-19 18:46:34
It's common in all crypto related subs sadly. Constant bashing, to the point of death threats  and doxing...
@_date: 2016-12-29 12:31:10
Hell, I'd use Bitcoin for this if it was available
@_date: 2019-08-19 18:53:59
Because people have a shred of hope that maybe... Just maybe Satoshi will show his face one day. Nothing wrong with being cautiously optimistic imo
@_date: 2016-12-12 00:53:17
Here we go again!
@_date: 2019-10-05 17:33:42
Great, now u fucked us
@_date: 2016-12-22 21:27:46
I honestly want it not to be a bubble, but I'm also hoping it's a bubble so I can buy in!
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:48:27
Shitty man :(. Just have two questions for ya. First question, we're u swapping any form of crypto currency from one bittrex account to another?(like a completely separate account, could be someone else's bittrex account) and two, do you happen to be overseas? Heard issues with accounts on the other side of the globe. Either way, I hope for a quick resolution for you!
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:25:28
I feel like at this point, this person is trolling. They wouldve accessed their btc during the last bullrun.
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:17:42
I have also waited for this sale :) needed another one with all these damn forks to Bitcoin......  And that I do like investing in some alts.
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:51:15
Holy shit, thats alot man :) I see if I can put out a tweet or something else as well to raise awareness. Edit: just put out a tweet to help resolve your ticket. Hope that helps.
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:39:19
Ok well like for example, let's say my buddy has a bittrex account , and so do I. He sends me over 1 ltc from his accounts wallet over to my accounts wallet. Bittrex doesn't like people doing that, and usually I'm told yo just send it off bittrex to a personal wallet before putting it back into bittrex. This also applies to people who use multiple accounts. Makes sense?
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:44:59
Bitcoin diamond will follow :P
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:54:55
75%? Thats a stretch.
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:13:49
Jeez  man.... they are witch hunting you now. I'm personally still waiting to see closure to this story of locked funds on bittrex!
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:59:04
This might very well be the reason why :( however , I already put out a tweet for you, so hopefully that helps.

The only time I can think of BTC dropping that low besides the mt gox crash was during the drama with the fork. I believe it'll drop, but not by 75%.
@_date: 2019-12-19 17:52:06
What's the name of the exchange?
@_date: 2019-12-20 15:19:50
If you cant name the exchange or give us any insight, then this post was a waste of time.
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:01:11
U are one lucky bastard. Congrats!
@_date: 2017-04-29 19:18:47
As the banking on bitcoin movie stated, it was a monumental transaction that needed to happen for the sake of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-04-03 18:38:03
What was this about? Edit: removed a dumb period.
@_date: 2017-04-06 20:45:07
Hmmmmmmm. Ok, so it's like they are saying, why offer to pay for dinner, when  they know someone else will?
@_date: 2017-04-08 10:31:39
Take me on ur next trip! :P but back to the subject, sounds like u gotta research locations who accept it before heading there. 
@_date: 2017-04-25 16:49:21
Ehhhh.... it might? Different guy, not to mention the fact with China really showing regulation. It's a possiblity.
@_date: 2017-04-08 10:29:56
Didn't he even say he was for it?
@_date: 2017-04-18 20:03:53
They are prolly waiting for ltc to get it before they make any decisions.
@_date: 2017-04-03 18:42:34
Think of a node like the railway or of Bitcoin, with the miners being the train. Now imagine the company who built the railway won't accept a certain type of item let's say nukes, so they bar the train from tranporting or moving anything.  At least thats how I make of it.
There are many factors that matter besides hasing power. Nodes, exchanges, even the users. All need to be in majority agreement for it to work.
@_date: 2017-04-27 15:53:23
What miners do u got and how many of them do you have? Also, how do you manage the noise?
@_date: 2017-04-23 17:24:53
I really can't see that being a possibility. They literally JUST payed everyone back from the hack! Maybe they'll close shop, but I doubt losing funds will be an issue.
@_date: 2017-04-12 15:19:09
Someone mentioned blockstream might start mining.
@_date: 2017-04-29 19:27:00
I'm more so thinking growth is up across the board because adoption is up.
@_date: 2017-04-08 10:25:41
Good luck. I still have my doubts we will see any change.
@_date: 2017-04-03 19:17:43
By all means! Urs is better anyway.
@_date: 2017-04-18 14:27:23
It's not just about the money. I'll admit, it does play a strong factor, but it's also because of this recent vote.
@_date: 2017-04-06 20:55:22
Funny if the site was responsible for a price hike 
@_date: 2017-04-03 18:45:35
Ahhhhh icic. Well good on them! I really thought people were screwed over on this.
@_date: 2017-04-03 21:32:39
For a moment , I did think to myself of cashing out the moment the fork was mentioned and gain steam. Glad I held out, as it shows the fork is near impossible 
@_date: 2017-04-06 19:58:16
So what you're saying is this allows them to start looking for another block quicker? Is that really the only benefit?
@_date: 2018-11-30 18:05:31
Actually... Yes. It's been seen time and time again. People go to great lengths.
@_date: 2018-03-20 13:53:39
How will they install malware on a device they don't have access to? As long as u are safe with what u browse on your computer, you are fine.
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:16:56
That is the biggest hurdle. Even if I make a 500$ purchase using btc, I'm looking at paying an additional 30$ (roughly)  not including international pos fees to get back what I spent. It was easier to accept this cost when prices were higher and more volatile, but as of right now i can't bring myself to eat that cost.edit: for the record, I've bought my PC, my puppy, and my bed with btc so I have used it for payments before.
@_date: 2018-11-30 17:19:19
This is a fucking foolish thing to say you very well might come to regret. I suggest deleting this post while you still can because reddit doesn't forget or forgive these kinda things 
@_date: 2018-03-20 15:21:44
Close to the bottom of this , BobAlison has a post that sums it up. At this point, it's a he said, she said kinda thing. Ledger didn't downplay this, they have it in their official blog. And when I get the chance, I'm going to read his post a little more.
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:35:19
And that is why you don't poke it.
@_date: 2018-03-20 15:02:05
Understandable, I have no arguments for either wallets at this point. Both are just as good. And yes, I do trust them. If shit hit the fan with their wallet, we would be in alot more trouble with BTC than dealing with this wallet situation. Last time we saw a major hack, it tanked the market.
@_date: 2018-03-20 13:06:43
Awesome thank you. So it's literally what ledger said 2 weeks ago. Sounds like they were totally right in their situation 
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:45:22
Just looked at it now. only problem is they had a chance to correct this statement before they came out with their official release about the exploit. At this point I'm.going with ledger on this, partially based off on how their exchange of words went before.
@_date: 2017-09-19 13:03:00
I wouldn't say it's pointless. GPU mining experienced this, not to mention u kinda see this with asic mining as well.
@_date: 2018-03-02 19:49:00
Now we need bittrex to lower their fees.
@_date: 2018-03-27 05:07:17
Dude was guilty as fuck. But a life sentence I don't agree with.
@_date: 2017-09-19 13:16:16
Damn it! I can't load the page.
@_date: 2017-09-22 14:14:07
Not defending bitmain here, but isn't it in the fine print no refunds?
@_date: 2017-09-19 12:53:40
It'll obviously affect their business, but it won't ruin them completely. They were already looking into opening minging operations here in the states, and China still hasn't said anything about banning the production of miners.
@_date: 2018-03-20 13:35:59
Still sounds like they need the device in their hand at some point though.
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:15:16
I have both, and the only reason why I like my nano s over the trezor is because it has much more coin support.
@_date: 2017-09-22 14:12:23
Hey, we can dream can't we? :)
@_date: 2017-09-19 14:32:01
I honestly couldn't say. It's definitely possible, but then again, it's also possible McAfee is offering them drugs XD
@_date: 2017-09-22 14:11:54
Maybe they used them first before deciding to put them on the market?
@_date: 2018-03-20 12:20:26
Any chance someone can make a tldr? I'm stuck at work, and I'm curious of everything ledger said before was correct from their Reddit post.
@_date: 2018-11-30 18:31:15
 Don't doubt the man behind the computer. People HAVE gone through drastic measures. I understand you don't believe me, but there are plenty of examples of when things go to far.
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:31:15
In the tldr, it was stated IF they have access your device. Both exploits. That's what I'm going off of. Also, no need to down vote me for disagreeing with me. This plainly pertains to discussion.edit: what I'm talking about:  edit:2 also, this was from their initial discussion. They had two weeks to correct his statement, which did not happen. So I'm definitely going off their word over his at this point, especially after seeing their exchange between each other before this came out. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:19:49
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:12:12
Dude, this whole  situation is fucked up. I'm staying out of this for now. No point in jumping in on what could be a bad gamble.
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:33:55
The problem with McAfee is, not once did he refer his picks as pumps. He always calls em the coin of the day/ coin of the werk( whatever you call it.) I agree he's definitely pumping shit, but it doesn't do us any good without concrete evidence.
@_date: 2017-10-16 13:51:59
Ok clarification: are they talking the U.S. bank company? Or do they mean all banks in the USA?
@_date: 2018-07-30 15:59:21
Fuck, majority of us in Bitcoin ignore everything. Edit:spelling.
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:02:27
This is actually pretty bad. I don't feel safe to be in this type of market
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:03:57
Yea, I can't recall the last time I've seen btc drop this low, to going back up to 9k in 3 seconds, back down to 8200 in 1 sec
@_date: 2019-09-24 23:02:45
@_date: 2018-04-27 17:12:49
God damn it. I use pnc as well. Who did u buy from?
@_date: 2017-05-17 17:23:27
Once my other PC arrives, I'll be setting up a node just for this very reason. When does this plan officially start? Wasn't it August?
@_date: 2017-05-20 20:56:28
Yes, it would. Transaction fees would drop significantly, and people could once again start using it for tranactions
@_date: 2015-03-24 14:12:33
Question, what do u think is the price to buy at?
@_date: 2017-05-05 16:35:20
Question for you. Are you stuck paying international POS fees for ur purchases? 
@_date: 2017-05-17 21:11:38
Nullc, you do you feel about this deal with segwit/block increase?
@_date: 2017-05-02 17:15:54
Yes this is normal. Little to do with the value, but more so the backlog of transactions. This has been quite common for months now. I suggest next time to either wait until the weekend to do transactions, since they clear up then, or send a high fee next time.
@_date: 2017-05-17 17:29:18
Alright thank you. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 16:11:36
Further input: ledger nano s I think you mean. Also, trezor is a good option along with keepkey. Trezor has been around for the longest, with the nano s being the cheapest .
@_date: 2017-05-05 00:53:44

Might be worth while to hold it until the next possible fork(block increase).
@_date: 2017-07-11 19:52:27
I would've pointed him to this. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:50:41
Clearly it's not as they are planning on on keeping majority of their miners on the btc Chain.
@_date: 2017-07-13 18:19:20
Ur on!
Edit: awwww the national news? That might be a lil hard to do in my state. But I'll try regardless. 2nd edit: heading to the store now to buy a poster to make this sign!3rd  edit: back from the store, making it now! 4th edit: after messing up the other side, decided to make the sign similar to the first guy  Edit 5: I'm going to be driving around the Milwaukee area shortly to try and find some news reporters.

God this is such a pain in the ass......
@_date: 2017-07-25 20:50:19
Honestly, its a done deal. Segwit will happen, one way or another. The real question is will the 2x part happen
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:26:07
I think they fixed that now with future firmware updates.
@_date: 2017-05-03 21:52:39
I agree with his statement. This is one of the only things I wouldn't buy off ebay.
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:49:41
I do the same guy. Cheaper transactions allow me to move it faster.
@_date: 2017-07-13 21:54:38
Thank you for the words of encouragement! I'm fully committed to doing this.
@_date: 2017-07-13 22:21:37
With little planning that i have, that can't happen today. Maybe if this fails, I'll try that next ;)
@_date: 2017-05-22 22:09:39
It's only Monday, give it some time. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 00:20:07
Booster gold! I think that might be a good costume for it.

Lol I take it ur around the area
@_date: 2017-07-17 18:02:38
Literally, all I needed to do to get a baby boomer on board to Bitcoin was have him watch the movie, Banking on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-15 17:54:05
Well, not like we can do anything but complain. They are the ones who control the fee amount, we have no way to adjust it ourselves.
@_date: 2017-07-16 01:46:33
I believe he's referring to the bloody day on the market. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 10:06:21
Once again, that ltc bounty is still up for grabs?
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:09:50
Because the next big hurdle will either cause more people into buying Bitcoin cash or staying in Bitcoin. Majority of big blockers have made it clear if the segwit2x doesn't follow through with the 2x part , all their resources will go into Bitcoin cash.edit:

@_date: 2017-05-08 00:49:53
It's sassiness in all its Glory?
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:29:51
This sounds like to me you can buy and sell still, but u can't deposit or withdraw from the exchange.
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:31:47
My statement still stands. Bitcoin works in mysterious ways ;)
@_date: 2017-07-13 20:43:39
Please do guy! I'll be suiting up now.

@_date: 2017-07-16 20:03:49
I doubt it'll crash to the floor unless they really fuck this fork up.
@_date: 2018-12-05 18:08:10
Nope, I haven't forgotten about you, and nope my answer remains largely the same. I'm glad to see you have a lawyer at least, but like I said before, there is nothing this group can do you for. Your next possible action if ur sick of waiting is taking a plane to their hq and talk to them directly. with 4.5 mil on the line, I certainly would.
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:41:20
Not that im aware of. They do however, let u buy ur BTC ahead of time while ur waiting for ur deposit to clear.
@_date: 2017-06-27 17:53:17
Idk, maybe actually buying them directly?
@_date: 2017-06-25 20:09:52
I think it will. It wont drop that low, the trend is drops, then goes back to 2700.
@_date: 2019-05-25 15:13:07
That's the problem I have with this situation. One side saying they cheated, the other side they didn't. So here is my question, to hopefully clear it up any bs. So they are saying the transaction was added manually, since it's near the top of the block. Is this true?  And is there physically a way to check if said transaction was added manually?
@_date: 2017-05-06 20:42:36
We have had alot of bad news on Bitcoin lately, and the price hasn't dropped from it at all. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:43:25
The part that bugs me the most, is the fact they are privately mining on it before people hop over. How exactly is it fair they get a decent head start?
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:40:56
That's what I thought. Last time I checked , they were more in the 9% range.
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:23:17
That is exactly what people said last time with the dip saying it was gonna hit 1500. The guys who bought at 1790ish looked smart. Nobody knows for sure.
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:05:10
If the soft fork goes smoothly, it won't lose value at all.
@_date: 2017-06-25 20:15:45
 We shall see. Gdax and coinbase are offline.. so you might be correct. Edit: going back down again.
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:30:31
Wow, I had no idea all those miners were willing to accept bip 148. Maybe this will happen after all?
@_date: 2017-06-27 17:38:40
One month warranty on a Bitcoin miner that is refurbished is a shitty deal.
@_date: 2017-06-26 11:56:39
I agree with that, but oddly gdax was also down initially.
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:39:15
If ur in an area with gemini, get that.

What makes u believe BTC will hit 3k?
@_date: 2017-06-13 17:03:09
Good. Then maybe we can finally end this damn war.
@_date: 2017-06-27 16:54:59
Good! The remind me when ur in a certain dairy state in the Midwest ;)
@_date: 2017-06-26 02:22:25
They are, but gdax is more likely to stay up when coinbase is down.
@_date: 2017-07-23 10:31:46
You know it's sad when even people in btc think your fucking nuts..... Lmao
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:07:24
What about the fact people are willing to wait? Buying a refurbished miner is a horrible idea.
@_date: 2017-06-03 14:05:57
Lmao he should! But in all honesty, OP is extremely lucky. Not many people actually get off with a warning. Most people just get yold what they did, then are given a certain amount of time to move their BTC.
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:33:35
 doesn't seem like this guy had a problem sending back a board... Twice.
@_date: 2017-06-13 14:26:18
Problem was with the agreement, due to some reason of the other segwit deployment, we can't deploy segwit(the one from this agreement) until sometime in December.... At least that's what someone said.

Yea, im kinda jealous people have it in their area.
