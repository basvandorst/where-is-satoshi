no... well... i might be wrong, but i'm pretty sure someone random in the pool is always responsible for being the one who finds a block. the way i understand it is that pooling is just about making a lottery into something more similar to a job. if you're the winner, you don't really care, since you share your prize with everyone else who played.

the opera example is the same as my example of posting content on a webpage. you don't have any obligation to allow strangers on your private property, and you have the right to remove them if they don't follow your own rules. but sure, there are some things to be said about bullying and harassment all the way to using your vocal cords in a way which can cause death. but when we talk about trolling on reddit, i can't in any way consider you a victim if you can simply just leave the webpage and close the browser. you actually agree to getting trolled by visiting reddit since the owners allow it on their private property. it's near as ridiculous as the horrible problem of people getting raped on second life.

i agree. don't think it's ready for prime time. i want to see increased privacy and armor against blockage of transactions before the protocol goes mainstream and thus making modifications too difficult, and before countries with more hostile governments jump on the bandwagon.

i just found out about that, i love the idea, but i'm getting nowhere with my old cpu. waiting for the gpu software to improve so i can at least get above the withdrawal threshold in a pool. and p2pool support would be nice. new proof of work systems requires a lot of coding in many places in the ecosystem. not criticizing it though, i hope we see more fresh ideas like this.

i'm not sure if i'm being paranoid or ridiculous, but there has been a concern in the back of my mind for a while that it wouldn't be the state that would force pieces of code into the software, like an automatic deduction of taxes to an IRS address or something, but the community would do it simply for convenience, and because they are pro-taxation. i'm sure we are still just talking about more easy data collection at the moment, but i really don't like where the conversation is going, and i hope enough developers considers the code sacred. otherwise i see a lot of infighting on the horizon.

this all seems kind of silly to me. the state likes to demand free money from its citizens so it can force bad monopoly services on the people. i think it's pretty inevitable that the tax authorities will accept whatever currency that becomes popular. why not push for getting your salaries in bitcoin first.

you almost had me there for a second. very close to what people actually say.
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:36:39
it depends. the status quo (and the belief in taxation) is what it is because of public education, and the social norms and culture, and it's self perpetuating in nature. the internet is (sometimes) causing people to debate about it intelligently and bring advanced concepts into the discussion, which were much more rare before the internet gave us access to all ism's and concepts through wikipedia and so on. but that status quo is pretty darn strong though. and this community has an exaggerated demographic of anti-taxation people which can cause us to think there are more of us than there actually is.

if one criticizes the conception that our fundamental rights in regards to firearms has not changed over time, but can not sufficiently present a substantiated argument against the conception mentioned, then perhaps a significant lack of courage is indicative of the individual with dissension towards the conception, because it may simply be a dissension based on sentiment towards political alarmism.

i actually wanted to elevate the conversation into talking about the way corporations are shaped, and that maybe instead of having the internal structure be hierarchical, or democratic, perhaps having one based on individualism is the way to go. because i don't think CEO's are striving towards having satisfaction and efficiency of only the majority of the workforce, but rather that each employee is an equally valuable asset. and i also think that the collectivist indoctrination we get by public schooling shapes the way we choose to organize corporations. but if nobody even sees any value whatsoever in such a simple thing as giving employees a tiny bit of freedom of choice over what smartphone they should be issued, how the hell am i going to get anywhere with such a conversation?

yes and no. it was born out of crypto-anarchist ideals, with the intention of bypassing government controlled financial institutions, and (correct me if im wrong) can more easily be used for tax evasion than dollars due to its technological foundations, if extra measures are taken for anonymity. but it is mostly advocated and invested in because of its usefulness, and most users will want to pay their taxes because batons and tasers hurts almost as much as questioning your world view.

well the idea is that if you remove the state monopoly of these services, they would have to compete to give you the best service for the lowest price. right now there's not really a reason for them to keep the costs down or provide a great service since you're forced to pay them anyway, and they are not at risk of you choosing someone else. but i'm sure government employees will tell me it's all way more complicated than that, and i'd love to hear it from the insiders. by the way, if the government really decided to privatize these services, it would likely be a half way "privatization" as usual, where they keep the worst of both worlds.

i see people's stupidity as a real threat to bitcoin adoption. what if people simply doesn't recognize the value in the invention? but this seems less of a threat when you think on a global scale and remember the economic desperation in the world, and then also consider that people never seem to have any problems jumping on to any mainstream bandwagons, as long as it's trendy. maybe the fact that it helps african charities becomes trendy enough when some super celebrity mentions it on tv.

@_date: 2014-04-01 17:24:45
yes, which is why i hope the developers are working hard to make bitcoin able to resist society more, before it goes mainstream and it's too late to make any big changes. and if you keep complying with the societal norms by letting yourself be scanned and patted down, you are legitimizing the system by making the people who resist it seem way more crazy in the eyes of authority. but the more people who resist those things, the more crazy the government will seem instead, and rightfully so.

i'm not sure what you want to know, so im just going to randomly describe what i think it is. i think it's some great code that anyone who is familiar with the python scripting language can use if they want to build bitcoin related software, or if you just want to play around making some fun or convenient bitcoin scripts. i think the main thing is that you can automate things that you usually do with your wallet.
@_date: 2014-03-29 09:01:03

i think other countries are just better at covering up the true nature of government. i think the only way to know what rights you really have is to put them to the test. and i haven't really seen any country that delivers on its promises when it comes to rights, when you actually give it a try. but as long as you stay within the norms, and don't do too much thinking, everything can seem perfectly fine.

i think that they will eventually streamline this process of compliance and convenience, and i agree with your previous point that this will set a terrible precedent. your picture and id is probably going to be associated with your btc addresses, and then both oppressive authorities and criminals will be able to track you from there on. i admit i don't know too much about tumbling or remixing, but it still doesn't look good to me. and if you really can stay anonymous, then everyone should be absolutely outraged over being forced to comply with id collection, because it's degrading.

i don't think it would ruin it as an invention, but i agree that we want the government to go home because it's drunk and leave us and the market to engage in peaceful and voluntary interactions with each other, as is our natural right. but it's probably going to take a long time before people see it that way, and instead bitcoin supporters will want government to get involved as much as possible to increase the acceptance and popularity by the liberty hating mainstream public.

i would probably suggest this to more independent alternative news source though, of your choice, instead of trying to help the western mainstream war-mongering bankster-supporting propaganda. sure they do some real investigative journalism on rare occasions, but i think it's too little, too late, and that their time is over as dinosaur media. and i was kind of hoping that their paywalls are helping them end their own suffering.

i had naive fantasies that with this new technology comes a new fresh chance to put our foot down and defend liberty on a new frontier. hah. i forgot how collectivist minded and hostile the vast majority of people are to free choice and the right to own and control your money, because of alarmism, fear, and dislike of personal responsibility. so now i'm just hoping that at least some people will change their way of thinking by playing and experimenting with the technology while philosophizing about the fundamentals of money and the ideology of the free market.
@_date: 2014-03-31 20:27:43
totally calm here, not angry at all. just not really understanding your definition of civilization. government is not just simply a collaboration, because of the reasons i just outlined. you usually don't need big men with guns when you collaborate on a project. the free market seems to be the biggest part of civilization. the government just redirects money and applies violence as it's the only thing they can do. you seem to be somewhat opposed to collaborations based on profit incentives, and more supportive of collaborations based on threats to arrest people, as is how the roads are built today, meaning with money from people who wasn't allowed to say no. so do you mean that this is the only way to do it, or the best way to do it? because personally i'll be fine with worse ways to build roads if it means i suddenly get to decide what to do with the money i own.

nobody can own anyone, and we can't delegate rights to a government when we never had those rights ourselves, like the right to tax. rights to coerce and govern human beings can't be conjured out of nothing, we are only pretending that government officials has those rights, when they don't.

if it was a choice between forcing people who doesn't even intend to use that road to pay under the threat of arrest, vs. charging people who actually use the road, i would prefer toll roads. but it would be incredibly simpleminded to think that toll roads are the only solution in the world to fund private roads. but to give you some perspective, the tax collectors themselves have been getting away with setting up tax tolls on roads, so that people can double tax themselves. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 11:03:14
this seems accurate. but there are many thousands of those script kiddies, which would mean that there's quite a few people with some skills there. but i don't really see any positive outcome from taking any hacktivist action in any form against the IRS, because it always sends the wrong message to everyone. maybe if they leak some internal document or email that proves that it's an actual attack against bitcoin, but the chances of that happening seems to be somewhere between 3%-0%, since i don't think the IRS sees it that way.

well now we are talking about two things. the philosophy of the relationship between legal and illegal vs. right and wrong, and the reasoning behind having laws in the first place. even with speeding tickets, i see the point, that you're putting the lives of other people in danger. and i also see the point with laws against pedophilia because human beings still in development can't be assumed to be capable of responsibility and good judgement, so it's exploitative and it causes mental scarring. we can talk about the reasoning behind his charges, or we can talk about situations where breaking the law could be more responsible than following it, for example if the law is oppressive or in violation of individual rights, and depending if you're more concerned about your own skin, than the well being of the coming generations. but the latter is kind of a big conversation, and i'm just mainly curious about the reasoning behind this charges. if the reasoning is simply "he should be punished for breaking a rule", then i can settle with that explanation, and it would just increasingly make me question the legitimacy of the current justice system.

yeah i've seen that one, and it's the most convincing perspective for me at the moment. but i think its quite a heavy burden of proof to say that the whole planet is statistically speaking warming even though all temperatures are subdivided into a random looking mosaic of local zones which seemingly seems independent AND the amount of warming that is happening AND that CO2 is the cause of it AND that the humans are responsible for the most increase of CO2 AND all the alleged repercussions this will have in the future. that is a long chain of claims to prove. but i've done a lot of reading into both sides and both sides are very convincing, so i still don't really know what to think about it. it also doesn't help that there are big financial and political interests on both sides as well, which is interfering a lot in the scientific world.
@_date: 2014-03-31 13:21:55
i could be wrong here, but to use your example of the bank robbery, my understanding is that there are anti money laundering laws that has (metaphorically and figuratively speaking) made driving a car away from the bank with other passengers a punishable crime, if not, at least putting a legal obligation of the bank to report every car they see outside the bank to the authorities, which means you can get fined or go to jail if you don't report every car. sure, it does help the authorities catch bank robbers, but at what costs? i think there's quite a huge difference in laws when it comes to blood cleaning. blood cleaning should be much more regulated, because it's indicative of a much worse crime. you should be forced to give hand and iris scans and passport and photo id's every time you try to buy cleaning products, and the merchants should be arrested immediately for not reporting every purchase to the anti blood cleaning agency. i'm sure this is a very flawed and stupid example, but i just wanted to give a bit of perspective when it comes to how we approach the crime of covering your tracks for something actually immoral. i argue that we have the natural right to engage in voluntary mutually beneficial transactions of value between us, without a 3rd party authority governing the transaction. this means that forcing one side of the interaction to either require identification, or get fines or be thrown in jail, is really a human rights violation by authorities. but only if you recognize the fundamental right to engage in peaceful interactions of any kind with other adults on yours and their terms. you have a natural right to exchange bitcoins and dollars between your family members, which means you have the right to do it with with strangers, and you have no moral obligation to make sure the money didn't come from crime, just as you have no moral obligation to make sure the person you're selling cleaning products to will not use it to clean up blood. but the justice system violently disagree with me on this point and is very hostile to the idea of allowing people basic freedoms if it can aid potential criminals in any way.

i could use some downvotes, and im bored, so i'm gonna join you here and take your joke seriously to criticize it. while its true that fluoride decreases iq in developing children, i think other factors are much much more prevalent, like the public school system and other institutions in society with the end result of causing compartmentalized thinking, normalcy bias, and lack of critical consistent rational logical reasoning, which i'm still struggling with myself after a huge chunk of my life has been wasted by mandatory schooling. it's causing everyone to be unable to draw parallels and connections, or see how patterns on a macro-level actually influences their personal lives on a micro-level. nobody with these skills would say "who gives a fuck about.." property rights, trading rights, freedoms, global exploitation, poverty, scientific achievements, etc. it all influences us directly, but most of us thinks that these are things we have no individual relation to. we think of it as "politics" and we think of politics as an interest or hobby. but politics for me means the collectivist subversion and corruption of all these things. i think of the previous concepts more as the respect for, and appreciation of human life.

as someone who has written exploit code for pdf documents, that is such a weird oversimplification that it ends up being false and true at the same time depending on how you look at it. i think the bigger problem probably is that pdf software developers and their users prioritizes more and more strange features over security, because of convenience. but this is a never ending struggle and the pdf software developers has locked it down a lot, but there's so much code to secure, and such a large exploitation target group that they are usually on the losing side of the war.

maybe i feel that way because i could be more towards being a noob than a veteran. i've been involved with bitcoin for over a year, including some minor asic mining, and setting up my own p2pool nodes, configuring conf files for rpcdaemons for around 30 different altcoin wallets, etc, etc, but i only recently realized that i have to keep backing up my wallet.dat files because they update every time you generate new addresses, and how paper wallets work and that you should swipe everything to not risk losing whats left, and i still don't know what txindexing means. so i think my knowledge of bitcoin is too random to be able to rate my skills, so i appreciate seeing random questions that i might not have learned about yet. and also everything around it like the philosophy of money, economy, taxes, regulation, stocks, and so on are very interesting to me on very basic elementary levels.

i agree. i ordered one from outside the country and also had to pay an unbelievable high toll fee which could never figure out why, and i don't even know which government forced me to pay. i had read a lot of criticism online so i knew i was taking a risk, and i was following the developments closely on their forum and came to understand that they had bitten off way more than they could chew as a company. i don't think they actually literally broke any promises, because i think they said "2 months or more" or something like that, which factually means between 2 months and eternity. it's unfortunate, and i don't think i will do business with them again because of their incompetence, but i don't personally support legal action against them.

i don't remember, i had been hearing about bitcoin from the liberty movement long before i tried it, and as a geek was always open minded about it's potential, and i've had a long series of those light bulb moments for more than a year after that. but a really big light bulb moment happened a couple of months ago when i backtracked the sources in satoshi's whitepaper which led me to the crypto-anarchist manifesto, because it made me see and realize the bigger picture, where open-source, TOR proxies, wikileaks, bittorrents, mesh networks, bitcoin, smart contracts, autonomous corporations, all adds up to a very real and significant ongoing inevitable crypto-anarchist technological revolution, which is not pushed by activists, but pulled by the market, and therefore has incredible momentum and potential to liberate the people.

When people care more about the structure of a sentence than its content, i stop paying attention.

i hope you don't mind me trying to take a stab at defending the notion that it's natural and therefore right. i come from the perspective that anarchism/libertarianism is based on individualism, while democracy is based on collectivism. and i define individualism as individual rights being prioritized over majority opinion, and collectivism as the sacrifice of individual rights for the good of the group. correct me if i'm wrong, but i think that this is not a false dichotomy, because in every isolated political situation you have to make a choice whether to let individuals decide for themselves, or to decide for them based on majority opinion. individualism and collectivism are polar opposites. but by all means try the socratic method to prove me wrong, because i've only had this philosophy for a couple of years and could be missing something. as i understand it, collectivism is flawed, because you sacrifice individual rights for the good of the group, while ignoring that the group or collective is made up of individuals. an individual is a specific tangible thing, while a collective is more of an abstract concept, just like how you can touch a tree, but you can't touch a forest. and more importantly, it also seems to be a matter of fact that we own ourselves, rather than it simply being an opinion, and it is from this premise most of natural law is derived from. but if i can find a more scientific and logically consistent way of looking at rights and politics, i will have to change my stance.

i think making any suspicious activity around a crime illegal is a very lazy way of making police work more convenient while increasingly infringing on the rights of ordinary citizens. i think it's more healthy to follow principles and sticking to them, which means we have to stop arresting people for victimless crimes simply because the acts are indirectly related to the crime culture, and stop over-regulating the market and thereby halting economic growth and positive technological evolution. the anti money laundering laws are making dealing with the bitcoin ATMs ridiculous. it's always the innocent law abiding citizens that are ultimately punished for the actions of the criminals, and the criminals usually just find ways around it anyways.

I think we would have to have a separate conversation for every vaccine. For example, during the ridiculous swine flu hysteria the advisers to the world health organization held close financial ties to the drug companies that profited from the sale of those vaccines. They succeeded in exaggerating the risk so the WHO declared a phase 6 pandemic, even when the mortality rate of the virus was lower than a normal seasonal flu, and could be halted with simple vitamin D supplements, of course resulting in billions of dollars in profits for vaccine manufacturers. They also decided to go with special patented vaccines based on adjuvants, which were untested, and scientists argued that they could have just mixed particles from the new strain with the previous year's seasonal flu vaccine, which would have been much simpler, more reliable and less costly. It would be naive to think that these kinds of patterns doesn't emerge all over the vaccine industry, but as i said, we would have to have a conversation about each and every vaccine and how the vaccination campaigns are handled, just as we can't just claim that all pharmaceutical medicines are always perfectly good and safe, and pretend that the FDA and authorities doesn't have any problems.

i think the way you win over authority is to break the chains of (perceived?) dependency on what they do, and thereby render them obsolete and reduce their relevance. i'm imagining a decentralized shared charity fund, of sorts, that if gaining popularity and size might be seen as a voluntary tax that acts as a competitor to non-voluntary tax. but these fantasies are pretty vague, speculative and long term. but i think the new crypto protocols can certainly help something like that grow pretty large.

Well, let's say your premise that people with bad spelling has bad ideas is correct, then aren't you are ruining your own tactics by telling them that you ignored them because they spelled badly? Because this can lead to people with bad ideas spending more time to correct their spelling, thereby bypassing your firewall of judgement you use to filter out noise. But jokes aside, personally I've read a lot more shit by arrogant so called intellectuals who knows how to spell perfectly, but fall victim to every logical fallacy in the book, because of having a good education, but being incapable of having anything remotely resembling a logically consistent thought process. Because that's what most education ultimately gives you. Literacy is a form of slavery if the reader is incapable of applying critical thinking, but the critical thinking the educational institutions teach generally has more to do with cherry picking "credible" sources, and trusting them blindly, rather than attempting to verify each claim on its own, regardless of source. So correct spelling doesn't tell me shit when i critically read texts, and i save way more time by skimming over the arguments in the text, than searching for missing apostrophes and deciding how many of those are required to fulfill the quota required to indicate that the content of the text is likely to have flawed arguments.

look up "technology adoption lifecycle". the fanboys, or early adopters, are one of the five categories of people that the success of an innovation depends on. i'm just an organic part of the system of progress that you're referring to when you say it will succeed or fail based on its own merits. and i think you're missing an important piece of the puzzle. in Geoffrey Moore's "Crossing the Chasm", he points out that for disruptive innovations, there is a gap, or chasm, between the innovators/early adopters, and the early majority. but lets say that the technology is open source, rather than a product by a private corporation who spends millions on marketing and advertising, what do you think is the thing that bridges this gap? the open-source technological evangelists. so you're basically just making fun of a naturally emerging process, or ecosystem.

yeah again i'm not criticizing the pool or the idea of community driven projects, i think it's great. i just felt horrible misled by the article. and i'm also interested in if there actually is a technical way to solve the attack. for example, there are pools that automatically switch to mine the most profitable currency. i wonder if there isn't a way to have a portal you connect to with your miner that automatically redirects you to pools, in order to distribute everyone evenly and safely, and at the same time solves the problem of some miners ending up at more profitable pools than others, since all pools have different rules.

and paying taxes is the most important use for crypto currencies according to these libertarians? to be honest i'm not sure i care so much about bitcoin gaining recognition among taxation enthusiasts in particular. if the first question you ask about bitcoin is "but can i pay my taxes with it?", then you'll probably be happier with government controlled money. its just a thought but maybe we would increase the chances of society changing for the better if we focus on selling the idea of bitcoin to people who are a bit more forward thinking. especially since the tax authorities aren't stupid and will inevitably want it to be as convenient as possible for people to pay taxes, since less people will question the legitimacy of it, the easier it is to cooperate with authority.
@_date: 2014-03-30 04:45:28
except about half of your taxes goes to the profession of killing people, and the rest goes to creating shitty monopoly services with no competition. i'd rather give people a choice of what to do with their own money, thanks. if taxes were voluntary, and all of those services had competition, all of a sudden the government would be forced to actually be competent. what's the incentive now? democracy? as citizens, we're like the kids in the shopping carts, trying to steer it with that fake toy wheel that isn't connected to anything.

i guess it depends on your perspective and definition of "democracy". my understanding of democracy is that it's based on collectivism, meaning individual rights are sacrificed for the common good; the majority rules over the minority. therefore i am actually anti-democratic and instead support individualism. to my understanding property rights are derived from self ownership and natural law, rather than laws created by a majority of people. i can see the parallels bitcoinmagazine is trying to draw between democracy and bitcoin on a technological level, but i think its ultimately more about individualism, self empowerment, and having complete liberty and responsibility for what you own. it seems to me that bitcoin came out of crypto-anarchist circles, and therefore it makes sense that its ultimately more anarcho-capitalist than democratic in nature. but of course the technology is useful enough to be used in democratic ways if people wish to do so.

well i would say the interest is one sided and simplistic. nothing wrong with that, but bitcoin has a ton of side issues and social, cultural, economic and geopolitical implications, and you can't really run away from or ignore that easily, especially not in an internet forum that allows a lot of freedom of speech.

centrally controlled digital currencies that verify that double spendings doesn't happen on a central server have existed for a long time. it's the decentralization that is bitcoins awesome-sauce, and allows so many other decentralizing technologies to be built upon the protocol. but sure you can go back a couple of decades if you're looking for a more old fashioned nostalgic central command solution. i'm just not sure why.

actually, its probably really skewed statistics. i have no idea how they did it, but its an online survey which could mean that the link spread in bitcoin community resulting in a disproportionate number of people taking the survey. because why would people click on a link and take a survey for something that they don't know what it is? but perhaps Harris Interactive is a bit smarter than that about their survey, and it's just being misrepresented by the media as usual. just speculating.
@_date: 2014-04-14 13:20:56
well your post was an opinion about how people should behave when they talk about bitcoin, and that people shouldn't sound so anti-government. you made the point that the general public don't understand the threat of government, even in the wake of the snowden leaks, which by the way has even led to some corporations selling privacy products through marketing with anti-government sentiment. he made the point that government is in fact the most powerful threat to everyone. it doesn't have to be an uphill battle to explain this to people, especially not when you mention that bitcoin is a global network, and that there are much more oppressive governments out there who intimidates and disappears dissidents even more often than the us government does. hard to believe, i know. for them the privacy and anonymity of bitcoin can even be a matter of life and death. this is why i think it's very important to fix the pseudo-anonymity of bitcoin so that much stronger privacy features are turned on by default. and that means even for citizens in the western world, who still lives inside their protected fantasy bubble world view, and still believe that no peaceful activists are persecuted in their own country. even if they don't see a value in having privacy for themselves, by being a part of the bitcoin economy, and thereby making bitcoin more useful, they would indirectly be helping peaceful activists globally, who are much more threatened by all kinds of governments. also the fact that with bitcoin you can't put economic blockades on organizations like wikileaks is a big deal.

no there isn't. but there is a difference between free speech and posting content to a privately owned server. the owner of the site has every right to remove content, because of property rights. but personally i make the choice to allow trolling whenever i have the decision, simply as a matter of consistent free speech principles, even if i do have the right to block and ban it. being treated with respect is not a right, it's only an expectation. if it was a right, then you morally could forcibly coerce anyone to treat you with any respect you desire.

my guess is out of fear. the fear that the worst assholes will win. that seems to be the main incentive of the people i've talked to. so you pick the asshole that is the least evil, and you ignore other alternatives because you know they don't have a snowballs chance in hell. i think it also makes you feel as if you've made a difference, as long as you stay in denial of voting for evil. and as Bill Clintons university professor Carrol Quigley pointed out; "The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies, one, perhaps, of the Right and the other of the Left, is a foolish idea acceptable only to doctrinaire and academic thinkers. Instead, the two parties should be almost identical, so that the American people can "throw the rascals out" at any election without leading to any profound or extensive shifts in policy."

the government can do a lot more than fuck all with their information about how many bitcoins you have and what activist organizations they know you send them to. this won't be an easy fight. because there are people within the bitcoin community who would like to make the technology more compliant with regulations. there is talk about being able to blacklist coins for example. and i think we need to be extremely non-compromising about bitcoin neutrality and privacy if we don't want to see people getting disappeared and tortured in oppressive regimes just because we underestimated the ability of authorities to fuck with our lives.

@_date: 2014-03-22 08:18:19
i don't really think these are good metaphors. its more like  where people port-scan the internet and show it to everyone, which i think does more good than harm, because people can search for themselves and see how exposed they are so they can change their behavior to get more privacy. a better metaphor is that its a lot like full disclosure instead of so called "responsible" disclosure in the IT security world. if you keep problems hidden, nothing will probably be done about it, and the people with the expertise and finances (criminals and government) are free to take advantage of everyone's ignorance. so with bitcoin i think it would be good to show everyone their lack of privacy, by compiling it and making it easily accessible, so they know and can behave accordingly. but these are just my thoughts about it.
@_date: 2014-03-22 19:01:33
yeah, monetary freedom is anti-politics and pro-individualism. it's idealism because it really is about changing peoples lives. and it feels weird to have campaigns and banners to push for a new technology. i don't know, but i don't think they did that with the HTTP protocol, or even the internet for that matter, even if it resulted in drastically changing everyone's lives. i think the best way is just to individually use it and tell people what it is if they ask. because nobody cares if they aren't interested in the first place, and nobody has any interest in changing an opinion they already have.

i would have to look into all the charities and organizations individually. i'm very critical towards the bigger charities, who just throws money at big pharma and perpetuates the mainstream medical industry, which is in bed with the government regulatory agencies and hellbent on crushing alternative cancer treatments. in some cases the same corporations manufacturing cancer medicine also has chemical factories largely responsible for causing the cancers in the first place, by polluting and selling carcinogenic consumer products. i don't think a "cure" can ever be found, because cancer is not that type of disease, so i understand the focus on more effective treatments rather than a "cure", but i think a whole lot more focus should be put on prevention, by countering industries responsible for cancer, and on supporting alternative solutions rather than cracking down on them. there is a war going on between mainstream and alternative medicine, and i think both sides would be better off cooperating, because people are dying.

The interesting thing about the sub is that it brings so radically different ideologies together because of a common interest, and it creates some very important discussions about the world, which i think is bigger than bitcoin itself, because it's expanding peoples world view by really exposing people to the other side, which i think at least makes people understand where the other side is coming from, even if they strongly disagree. And i think this is fairly rare, since everyone basically just enjoys being in their own little safe ideological bubble, and when you even get personalized search results that never shows you anything that you disagree with.

I don't know, but Bitcoin strongly resonates with the idea of free voluntary business interactions, free from meddling by third parties who thinks they have the right to stop you from exchanging value peacefully with other individuals. This would make it inherently attractive to any ideology that values freedom.

Again, just because your taxes may or may not go to truly good things, does not make taxation justified. And just because you can't figure out another solution to help those in need, without taking property away from innocent people, does not make it the only way. And also, fairness, as in everyone having to be forced to suffer equally to support those in need seems more important to you, than those in need actually getting helped by a few caring individuals. Why is that? You really don't seem to like the idea of free choice.

There are two kinds of rights, which i think are named badly and causes confusion, but there is the concept of "positive rights" which means you would have the right to things or services, like ice cream, or healthcare, which means that someone else is obligated to provide this to you (taxpayers) regardless if they want to or not. And then you have "negative rights" which means that you have rights to do things yourself, and nobody can infringe on those rights, for example freedom of speech, the right to your property, including 100% of your money and income, and the right to defend your property, including your life, since you own yourself. Personally i only recognize "negative rights" to be legit, because i think "positive rights" pushes obligations on other people and removes their freedom of choice of who they do business with, or give their money to. This to me looks like a violation of self ownership, and doesn't seem to be too far from slavery.

Because it was discussed in a presentation at Bitcoin 2013 for one thing. There is a need in the community to make bitcoin more "credible" through increased cooperation with government. Some people think it's a good idea. Others thinks it's a horrible idea, for many different reasons. One reason is that government has a tendency to either screw up royally, or fail miserably whenever it meddles with anything involving the internet. So it's not only about politics and ideology, its also about practicality. That said i see nothing childish about questioning the validity of the premises before applying logic to the decision making. Appeal to authority, appeal to common practice and appeal to tradition are all logical fallacies.

I think it's too hard to say whats realistic or not, because we really have no idea where this is going. This could change the world globally and remove power from the banking cartels and change the status quo in 3rd world countries, or it may just wither away and die within months because people can't see it's potential, or anything in-between. This is why i think it's so exciting to see it's development in the world through reddit, and i certainly don't mind hearing everyone's personal perspectives on it, even if they do aggressively project their own ideology onto it, because i think it matters, and a good way to measure the temperature of how the public are perceiving it. Additionally i enjoy the complete unrestricted freedom of discourse, and that everyone are free to say anything they think about it. But not everyone feels the same way about it, i suppose.

There is a thing called charity organizations which could help people in need without violating everyone's natural rights in the process. Bitcoin could make this even easier, and thus render taxation even more obsolete than it already is.

"Paying taxes" implies you have a choice. We haven't even reached a point where it matters if i agree or disagree to your point of view. The state doesn't care about my opinion, or the truth, or my natural rights to keep what i earn without a third party taking it from me in blatant disregard of my individual rights, in the interest of the common good. My money is taken, and things are given back to me randomly regardless of whether i want it or not. The free market however respects my voluntary free choices, and i can vote democratically with my money without imposing my preferences on anyone other than myself. This is the most ethical system of voting, and it at least makes corporate reputation and customer satisfaction somewhat a factor in the equation. But forced taxation means a secured revenue for government services, regardless of my satisfaction. The only way to ensure competence of government services is self administration from the top, which is obviously failing miserably.

How does an individual become "part of a government"? Are you referring to social contract, that you give up your natural rights simply by being born in a country? In that case i guess i should have chosen my country more wisely before deciding to be born.

Collectivism is when the common good is considered more important than the rights of individuals. Like the right to keep what you earn, for example. I suppose that you agree with this collectivist view, and consider a violation of individual rights a good thing for the common good. In other words, you think it's a good thing that i am personally forced to pay for services, that i might not even use, against my free will. Well, i guess you may not like to have your free will, and that is okay, but don't you think it's a bit mean to force me give up my free will as well, just because you don't mind it personally?

Liberty is the time in your mind between stimulus(fear) and response(actions taken because of panic). Government is very powerful when it comes to causing fear in the minds of the public, but relatively powerless when it comes to physically removing freedoms in the real world. Most oppression is fueled by ideas held within the minds of the citizens, not so much by the actual capability of the rulers.
@_date: 2013-06-05 21:05:01
Thank you. If i agree or disagree is irrelevant, the question is if the ideology is logically valid and rational, if the words used to support it are properly defined, and if it's aligned with the truth about our shared physical reality.

Whatever happened to the land of the free, home of the brave? I guess it's more like the land of strict and equal collectivist fairness, and home of the obedient and compliant.
@_date: 2013-06-04 10:47:58
So with that logic i could steal your money and give it to charity, since the money goes to a good cause. Of course not, because the removal of your free will from the equation is what makes taxes immoral. If taxation was voluntary, it would be completely moral. But it wouldn't be called taxes anymore, it would be called donations to government.

I'm sure Bitcoin is interesting to socialists as well. However i don't see how the philosophy of liberty and most forms of socialism is logically compatible, due to the fact that individualism and collectivism are polar opposites.

"The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies, one, perhaps, of the Right and the other of the Left, is a foolish idea acceptable only to doctrinaire and academic thinkers. Instead, the two parties should be almost identical, so that the American people can "throw the rascals out" at any election without leading to any profound or extensive shifts in policy."-- Carroll Quigley (Bill Clintons mentor/professor), excerpt from "Tragedy and Hope"(1966)

Everyone, except the public who is forced to "pay" taxes to services they don't even agree with. Including "paying" for 21% of Israels defense, apparently.

I like Bitcoin, because it gives society a chance to start over, and ask ourselves if our moral premises really are correct. Is it morally right, or justified, to build a society and its infrastructure with money accumulated from forcefully taking it from the citizens against their will? I think Bitcoin gives this choice back to us, a choice we haven't really had in a long time.

I had to look up panarchy and ideas of freely choosing government. Interesting concept. Don't know if i support your proposal, but it's certainly worthwhile to think about and analyze and criticize. I like the fresh ideas. But what does "reduces the cost of truth" refer to?

People own their property and should not be punished for owning more than others, or for refusing to give free money away to people that they might not even like or agree with. It's better to encourage empathic behavior and try to provide something useful or nice in return for the donations so that the transaction becomes mutually positive.

1) government takes public money regardless of consent to fund police 2) you take your neighbors money regardless of their consent 3) police arrest you for your immoral act, by using funds from their immoral act.

Taxing Bitcoin is fine, as long as it's completely voluntary and there's no legal requirement to do so. Because some people still have moral integrity and really can't live with the fact that their money is going to drone bombing Pakistani children and torturing innocent people, etc, etc.

I suppose you don't see how the technological, financial and philosophical aspects of it are fundamentally interconnected with the political discourse? For example, if we discuss how to practically implement taxation to bitcoin, i think it's very relevant if taxation is even desired in the first place if we are to allow the technology fulfill the needs of free market transactions. I think we do ourselves a disservice if we get too compartmentalized and tunnel visioned on the subject, without asking important questions about the bigger picture.
@_date: 2013-06-04 21:45:18
I absolutely agree. Well put.
@_date: 2013-06-04 12:40:29
You're right, that wouldn't work. You can't demand consent, because that wouldn't be real consent. This is why taxation can't be civilized. If you are the government and people don't want to pay for your services, then I'm sorry, you can't demand purchases in a free society. Then who would provide the services? People. People will provide the services. There is no government service that a company couldn't provide, because both government and corporations are run by people, with the same capabilities. Saying that only government could possibly build roads is like saying that only government can travel into space.

You can make the highly questionable argument that the "entire system would fall apart" if we didn't fund the system by taking peoples money against their will, but it doesn't change the fact that the act of taxation itself is immoral. The fact that the majority imposes this legalized theft on the minority is irrelevant in regards to it's morality. You could make the claim that it's a necessary evil. But you have to ask yourself if it makes sense to fund a police department through theft, in order for them to stop theft. If government services are provided to us in an immoral way, is it really worth it?
