Vote, let them know.

Because it is juicy... Sounds like mainstream news. IS IT JUICY? WILL IT GET ATTENTION? OK POST IT! DOESNT MATTER IF WE BURN THIS SHIT TO THE GROUND POST POST POST!!!
Yeah I am slightly annoyed lol. Mostly because I already see people writing about this everywhere. And other media is spinning your information in a way to make it look really bad.
@_date: 2018-09-03 06:51:52
I don't know why people are so happy with you investigating this. We have nothing to do with what he/she does with their coins. And these coins would hardly affect the market if noone knew about it. The impact of this post and the clickbait news headlines it will create, will be far more significant. If the price is affected by this, it will only be because you put a headlight on this and people will respond to it with emotion.

I see 1-2 people that come in this daily thread every single day, only to make about 5 negative posts based on nothing but their own sad emotional state... If you ask me their goal is probably to lower the sentiment because they sold around 6k and now they are scared. I am glad they are banned if it is the people I am thinking off, it was getting really irritating to see the same person post 5K COMING SOON, 1.3K INCOMING BOYS! etc etc.
@_date: 2018-09-05 10:25:07
I called the person out that did the tracking of this move. Told him that emotional people would respond by panicing while this thing would not affect the market if noone made FUD articles about it.
You just proved my point, great. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 06:52:06
IDK if it is you, but I also thought the guy was either trolling or in a serious state of panic. Either way I am glad they are gone.

Sadly almost nobody advertises for Bitcoin because nobody owns it. There will just be a ton of advertisement for shitcoins and maybe some exchanges.
@_date: 2018-09-03 06:53:17
I think his incentive is to create FUD because he sold his coins and wants the price to go back down so he can buy back. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 10:32:14
We'll see about that in the long term. Short term they are probably right. I just hate the fact that that person published his information without thinking. It was obvious that the media would take his information and spin it in a way to fit their narrative.
@_date: 2018-08-02 07:17:45
Does anyone else feel kinda trapped? I bought 1.5 year ago and have not touched my coins since then so I am up quite a lot, no worries there.
But I feel like I am trapped because wether I sell or hodl, it's a gamble either way... Hodl and price increases = win, price decreases = lose. Sell now and price increases = lose, price decreases = win?
I feel like selling might be even riskier than hodling at this point... What if I sell now and we moon soon? God damn FOMO feelings... I just can't win.

I'm not sure if it is the person I think off. But yeah there was this one person that came in here every day to make multiple posts about how bitcoin is dead and 1.3k is incoming. He/she probably sold at 6k and was just scared. It was annoying AF though.
@_date: 2018-08-08 09:31:59
It was not rejected, just delayed until the end of September. Which basically everyone expected to happen, we just needed a reason to go up or down.
@_date: 2018-08-31 09:11:06
You said it correct. You can't wait for it, because you'll be dead and long forgotten before bitcoin hits 2.5k again.
But hey, I get it. You sold and now you are nervous whenever the price rises so you come here to scream. It's ok, let it all out! :)
@_date: 2018-08-29 07:01:48
Man, how deep are your shorts underwater? No, wait. I do not think you have the IQ to open a short. You probably sold your Bitcoin around 6k and now you are terrified that it might go up. So you come into this daily discussion thread to spread your 4k FUD with like 10 different posts. Sounds about right? I think so...
@_date: 2018-08-31 11:26:50
That is true.
@_date: 2018-08-29 07:02:59
You have made this comment about 10 times in this thread, why? Feeling anxious?
@_date: 2018-08-30 09:28:04
I have a feeling this bull run will be a pretty significant one.
There, you can rest peacefully now :)
@_date: 2018-08-21 09:16:10
It's quiet in here.

I hope there is some demon general in hell who is tasked with keeping track of every person that ever makes these "FIRST!" posts. So that when they arrive in hell, every day a group of demons will line up behind them and the only thing you'll hear is the first demon in line shouting "FIRST!!" as he shoves his big spiked demon slong into your butthole.

You trust Binance with 1.2k BTC, that is some insane stupidity or just big balls... not sure.
@_date: 2018-06-06 06:44:56
The only thing that seems to be dropping like a rock is your sanity.
@_date: 2018-06-12 07:08:03
But more miners = higher mining difficulty = not more coins...
@_date: 2019-10-27 15:51:59
Omg this is perfect for when anyone asks how it is to hold Bitcoin. Can I download this somewhere please? :D
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:42:10
I'm mostly in BTC, own only a bit of ETH and I think Ripple is total shit. But presenting ETH and Ripple as only maintaining their spots for 1 month and 25 days is just stupid. We all know they have been there longer and just recently had a little dance for the 2nd and 3rd spots. Other than that, yeah, Bitcoin is Nr. 1
@_date: 2018-03-15 10:15:08
Too early indeed, but who cares. Even most bears are certain that on the long term these prices will mean nothing.
@_date: 2018-03-15 10:14:16
Following that advice I would have missed the ride from 2k to 20k... Additionally, that would mean you have to sell literally daily because it moves up and down so quickly, might as well become a day trader then.
@_date: 2018-03-20 08:03:13
I know you won't believe me, but I am honestly worried by the comments you made earlier. Please for your own good, go back to the basics and review your opinion about BCH. The things you were saying earlier were 100% propaganda spread by BCH pumpers and they are simply false truths made to look reasonable. I am not going to explain this in depth, there are more than enough resources online already that will explain to you why BCH is not the real Bitcoin, just like Bitcoin Gold isn't, or Bitcoin Diamond.

Did you even read the article? He has been in the market as early as 2010 and sold somewhere in 2013 before the big dip. He is not some FOMO newbie, he's not likely to sell any time soon during a dip when he does something radical like living on a camping to buy BTC.
