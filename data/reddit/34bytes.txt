Yes! The merchants must share their benefit with the consumer so they have a *financial* incentive to spend bitcoin.

Not sure I understand your question. It would be analogous to bill acceptor, for example.
EDIT: Yes, securing the device against theft will be something that must be considered for certain locations.

There are plenty of places where a smart phone or tablet doesn't make sense, especially in unmanned locations that have no attendant.

Waiting for confirmation(s) will be optional. It's widely accepted that for small transactions not waiting for confirmation is a very small risk.

The customer would never have to 'expose' their wallet. They simply send a payment from their wallet to the merchant's payment address for the cost of the bill.

As mentioned by someone else several weeks ago, Coinbase, and others, still really need to implement a 'automatic buy-and-replenish' feature. Where, after a purchase with bitcoin the same amount of bitcoin is automatically bought with fiat to replace what was spent. That would be a great encouragement to spending coins, or at least the elimination of a perceived downside.
@_date: 2014-04-24 17:37:16
Dead link.

A well written, good read. As utterly exciting as this all can be, it's important to realize/remember that we are still in the very, very early days.

34 Bytes ([34bytes.com]( is working on just such a solution. Its a hardware POS, and you will be able specify a specific receive address (or a list of addresses to work from) if you don't want to rely on a 3rd party service (but you can do that too, if you want). However, we are still in the prototype stage.

Thanks for the feedback!

Thanks for the questions! 
* We are not a related to Coinkite in any way.
* Currently the terminals support WiFi and wired internet. 3G Connectivity is something that we are definitely looking to integrate future models.
* We help the merchant send the bitcoin they receive to destination of their choosing. Currently that can be a fixed cold wallet address, or we can connect with their Coinbase account and have the funds deposited there. We intentionally do not touch fiat. We are working on plans to implement more options for locations and services where merchants can deposit their funds.
* The fee structure is something that we are still working out. There will be a small per-transaction fee of &lt; 1%. There will also be a small monthly fee that will cover API access and maintenance of the merchant 'portal' where merchants can log in and track their sales.
* Currently the QR code prints only on the invoice. We will be working on adding simple features like on-screen QR code display in the coming weeks and months.
* We are already working on plans to implement some other very cool features that we will announce in the future!

This is a very good question and the answer is that it depends on the merchant, what counter space they have, and other factors. It is certainly something that we have thought about and have heard about from a few merchants. One possible solution is to bring standard CC processing into our terminal, so that is will be a 'one-stop' solution. We are actively looking into this.
Software solutions do exist and some people will prefer them, but in speaking with merchants it seems that, believe it or not, there is a learning curve with these solutions that can inhibit ease of use in the store. We aim to avoid with our simple menus and intuitive operation. We have spoken with several merchants that no longer accept bitcoin due to technical problems with their tablet or smart-phone solution.
This current model does not support NFC, but that something we hope to address in the future!

The terminals work on zero-confirmations. We will be adding features so that a merchant can require some number of confirmations for transactions greater than some threshold.

Hi there! We are a new company in the bitcoin space and working on providing an innovative point of sale (POS) solutions for merchants to more easily accept bitcoin payments. We've been focused on building a quality product before we start doing a big media push, so lots of people haven't heard about us yet (unfulfilled hype isn't good for anyone, including the 'external' perception of bitcoin). We are running beta tests with the hardware right now.
Our perspective is that bitcoin has a 'user experience' issue right now that needs to be addressed for mass adoption to be realistic. We are trying to address part of that by deploying easy-to-use POS hardware. We have spoken with *many* merchants and the various apps that can run on a tablet or smartphone are just not easy enough to make for a smooth purchase process ('I don't know where the phone with the app is.', 'Sorry, the iPad battery is dead.', 'I don't know how to use the app.', etc). On the backend we are working to provide the merchant with many options for what to do with the bitcoin they receive. However, we will never hold bitcoin for a merchant, even as part of the transaction process.
We are particularly excited about this integration with localbitcoins.com because they have an solid international user-base and good reputation.
We would be happy to answer any questions anyone may have either here, or through our website 34bytes.com.

Great question. I think that recent rumors of impending Full RBF turned out to be false, but the question still stands, regardless.
Full RBF would be a huge blow to merchant trust and acceptance of bitcoin. At the end of the day, it all comes down to risk tolerance on the part of the merchant. Merchants currently deal with losses from theft whether it be from a 'customer' slipping something in their pocket and walking out, or leaving for before a dinner check is paid. It's an unfortunate reality.
What percentage of people would use RBF in a malicious way? What sort of businesses would be more likely to be targeted by these people? If Full RBF is deployed businesses would have to evaluate whether they want to continue accepting bitcoin.  If there is not a positive business case for the merchant, then no one could blame them for no longer accepting bitcoin.
As a company we would continue to operate these affected services and see how the community and merchants respond. Right now there are a lot of unknowns that prevent a more definitive answer than that.

We are working on that at 34 Bytes (34bytes.com)!
@_date: 2015-09-29 12:47:12
Thank you! Coinkite indeed does have nicely developed product. The most significant difference is the price of the terminal. We expect to sell them for about $250 USD each. This should help with merchant adoption. Currently the feature set of the terminal is intentionally simple, as we are just entering beta testing. As we get feedback from merchants we will be constantly updating and adding features to the terminal. Stay tuned!

There certainly are different apps that can run on a smart phone or tablet, and for some merchants those work well. However, our goal is to build a much simpler, more familiar, solution that doesn't require any special knowledge, and leaves the customer and merchant with a record of the transaction.

Venezuela is one of the best examples of the usefulness of bitcoin.

As simple as it seems an app should be, we have spoken with MANY merchants that experience trouble: the app is on someones personal phone, the attendant doesn't know how to use the app, the battery is dead, etc. Plus, no receipts!

@_date: 2016-07-18 19:38:47
We have not looked into deeply enough to find out, but at face value its just another way to get the address and transaction value into the phone, instead of using a QR-code
@_date: 2016-07-18 13:42:45
Yes. These transactions are all on-chain. We are working on giving the merchant the ability to ignore RBF-eligible payments, if they desire. We view zero-confirmation fraud as a low risk, on par with other risks that merchants already face (people walking out on their bill, pocketing an item without paying, etc.)
@_date: 2016-07-18 13:46:32
Of course our goal is to provide a cheaper alternative merchants. Initially processing fees will be 0.75% per transaction, and $10 monthly cost. The merchant will also pay some fees for converting to fiat, if they decide to do that. It is expected that this will still be much  more cost effective for the merchants. The normal 2.5% - 3.5% CC charges that are often talked about don't even fully account for all the fees that merchants are really paying.
