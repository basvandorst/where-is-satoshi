Um, Linux is the most popular OS in the world. It runs 99% of the world's supercomputers, Android phones are the most popular in the world, its the main OS for servers (Facebook, Google, and Amazon are all built on it, and nowadays Amazon hosts most of the internet in its cloud), and its one of the most popular OSes for embedded devices. It won, handily. It just hasn't taken over the desktop, but that's a minority of all computers.

I linked several other sources so you didn't have to take my word for it.
So you found a source that backs up my point more...? The server share being at 80% supports it being the most popular OS.
Also that's for cloud deployments in VMs. The OS of the underlying host at Google/Amazon/Facebook is all Linux.
@_date: 2015-12-29 13:44:34
Please provide your own sources then. I've interviewed at all 3 companies and they all said everything was on Linux. This is also further confirmed by the LWN link I posted. Or you could trust Quora:
Or this wikipedia article saying their web servers are Linux based:
Or the fact that they released 2 Linux based OSes (Android, Chrome OS) publicly and have a third one in house:
There's also an easy process of elimination. At Google's scale Windows licenses would be prohibitively costly and would fund a major competitor. OS X isn't even shipped on servers by Apple anymore, and would also fund a competitor. Solaris is owned by Oracle, who Google is in a legal dispute with over Java on Android (if they were Solaris based and making a phone OS based on Java apps why wouldn't they have based it on Solaris, the most 'native' platform for Java?). The BSDs are all either dying or restricted to niche use cases. There is no other OS Google/Amazon/Facebook could realistically be built on.

I didn't draw any line -- my point is that having wealth enables you to accumulate more, and in such a way that you make it harder for others to do the same. The math here is pretty simple -- in a zero sum game any gain you make is someone else's loss. The only way to avoid a zero sum game is if somewhere along the way you create new wealth (grow the pie). Landlords don't create any though. They don't fix any inefficiency or introduce any new technology. They just get wealth just because they already have wealth. And they use that wealth to buy more property so they can do it more, which drives property prices up.

Climbing up one level on the pyramid doesn't change that you're on a pyramid. You're poor in part because of the rent you have to pay on the house, which has its price driven up by rich people buying them to rent out at higher prices creating more people that can't ever accumulate enough to buy. The way you usually get out of this in economics is somewhere there is wealth creation -- but not with rent.

In every cryptocurrency I've seen the rules are determined by a majority of miners. It's pretty fundamental to how blockchains work.

You can also use leverage to go long. Every argument you make below can be inverted to say that it lets people artificially inflate the price.


A naked short can only ever be temporary. You still have to eventually close the position which involves buying. Also leverage is not unlimited -- you still have to put up some amount of capital and there is a maximum multiplier.

That has a tragedy of the commons problem. If a user doesn’t immediately selfishly get something out of it, they will be fine just assuming that somebody else will take care of it and freeload.

Steam and other vendors dropped support because of the combination of price volatility and high fees. Fees were a problem because it meant that it was going to cost more money in some cases to refund a user than the price of the original product!
If you were a Steam user and this was your first BTC experience, you're probably turned off the technology and not coming back. You probably won't recommend it when your less technologically savvy friends ask you about it. Every time somebody tries to use BTC and finds it utterly impractical, there is a non-zero probability that person is turned off of BTC forever. Or perhaps they consider alts and start bolstering a different community.
So I don't understand this whole we have all the time in the world viewpoint. If BTC were being developed behind closed doors in a vacuum, maybe, but impressions of it are constantly being formed, and the longer it takes for it to get wherever it's going, the more likely nobody will care when it gets there because either their enthusiasm will be sapped or they will have embraced competitors.

Uh, yes it does. If I don't cover my costs I go out of business. The price can't be completely arbitrary.
Ironically enough, Satoshi is the one who argued that the price *should be determined by the cost to mine*, citing precedent in the gold market. That was what he thought the eventual equilibrium that would be reached was. This occurs because if you try and charge a premium over your cost to mine another minor will undercut you, and this will repeat itself until nobody can undercut anybody anymore because to do so would lower the cost below the cost of the inputs, meaning any minor that continued to undercut would quickly be put out of business and the price would go back.

But again, it is never executed or compiled so there's no guarantee it remotely describes what it's supposed to. There's a reason they're completely absent at all the major tech companies and open source projects.

Can someone explain to me what the significance of having an army is supposed to be, specifically in regards to bitcoin versus the dollar?

No you're just not getting it and resorting to insults. A script for a play is still acted out -- actors and directors may improvise or change parts but you know that at least on average the published script is going to tell you the storyline for most productions of the play because it's what most actors and directors are going to start from at the start of each new production. No such thing for UML. There is no guarantee it stays up to date as the software evolves (which is more like one production of the play that runs forever and mutates every night) even if the design changes enormously so that the UML diagrams have no correspondence at all with the code. They also provide virtually nothing that can't be generated from the code itself, like say doxygen class diagrams, which you can at least setup to be automatically rebuilt in response to code changes.

That only prevents me from verifying someone voted the way I tried to coerce them too, which is not the main problem. The main problem is people taking keys by force or letting people sell their keys to others. Also the making sure the initial distribution of keys is only one per person... how are those handled in a system where there's no real world verification of pictures matching IDs?

Whether it's good practice almost every reporter does it. Watch any tech or science piece and they always do it to try and ask what the viewer is likely thinking so the interviewee has a chance to explain the story.

Aren't most of the seized funds DPRs profits, not users' balances? Also a sell off of those coins with no one fighting it with buy orders only brings the price down to 340$ or so.

Its not clear to me that there are financial institutions addressed by this notice other than the ones run by the state. Banks are state run in China.

A total market index fund equally invests in the entire market, so it grows as long as the economy does, regardless of which companies turn out on top.

THIS. If 90% of the value of gold is as a store of wealth as opposed to it's industrial or decorative uses then oh gee I can only lose 90% of my investment in gold what a consolation! Why the presence of a very low price floor is supposed to make me feel better is a mystery to me.

There is no institutional investment system in China anyway. That's why they got into Bitcoin.

Those huge sections constantly repeat that most of those medicines have never been shown to work better than placebo. Sometimes that's because no study has been done yet, but plenty of times they have been. Those sections are there because people are interested in them, not as an endorsement.

In practice UML will work much worse, since it isn't compiled or run you never have any guarantee it matches the code.

Like I said, they can still have physical theft. Does Coinbase transport the USB sticks to the back vault in an armored car? At the end of the day they're still a massive centralized pile of coins.
And still, 10% of all customer funds at risk could be huge.

The dividends will either adjust to be more in response to a lower valued dollar, or they will change to be paid out in BTC.

If the value of the dollar goes down it just means the S&amp;P price would be higher -- if the value of the companies hasn't changed the inflation or deflation of the currency itself of irrelevant.

You misunderstand -- if Bitcoin is a successful currency in the future but stocks are still sold in dollars then he has to trade his BTC for cash first. That doesn't mean he can't buy other things with the rest of his BTC or that he must believe BTC will fail. Dollars are obviously a mainstream currency today but you wouldn't be complaining about him 'selling to the bigger fool' if he had a million dollars on hand that he was going to buy the stock with -- buying stock doesn't mean you think the currency is going to fail, just that you think you can make better returns in some period of time by helping build a business with that money instead of sitting on it.
And who says the buyer is a fool? If you don't need the BTC on hand for purchases and the buyer does because he wants to turn around and buy something from a BTC accepting merchant, then you're engaging in a mutually beneficial transaction by selling him the BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:02:58
Yep, then when at least another zero is on the end you can cash out for $1 million (well, a bit more to cover taxes) and invest that money in S&amp;P 500 and total market index funds and live off the dividends for the rest of your life.

You don't understand, Chinese banks are run by the state and would never have any of those anyway. They're telling state institutions not to do those things. Bitcoin still enables all of those things to exist without banks.
