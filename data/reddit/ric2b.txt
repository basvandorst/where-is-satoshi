Yes but it wasn't as bad of a reason as miners getting paid to intentionally defraud someone. And sure, probably not 0 but I still don't know if it would be worth it for them. 
@_date: 2016-08-17 19:28:13
But they would have to be incredibly stupid to do that, as soon as it happened BTC's value would forever be pinned at 0, all of their hardware would become useless and any coins they were still holding would also be worthless. 
Since _at least_ 51% of miners would have to be contacted you wouldn't be able to keep the secret for long either, so it's likely that the value would start dropping even before the attack.

Understood, it just seems less relevant to me. 


It is, yes, because any inflation at all is already hard on poorer families because they can't afford to have money tied up in investments that shield them from inflation. Their salaries are barely keeping up with the 2% inflation rate (when they increase at all) and then they're also seeing higher rates of inflation than the claimed 2%. 
It's pretty sad.


True, but we shouldn't make it harder to escape. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 10:32:56


That doesn't go against what I was saying. Yes, they're still getting faster and cheaper but it's slowing down significantly. 10 years ago the computing power would double every 18 months at the same or lower prices. 


Go look at RAM prices, they're insanely high. We can pick individual examples that only account for maybe 2% of a families yearly expenses all day long, they don't matter that much. 


So you just picked a "random city", it's housing prices increase rate are "only" double the supposed inflation rate and you consider that proving your point?


Yes, it dropped to roughly 65% of its price from where it was 5 years ago, which is not even close to the barrel price decrease.
So yes, gas is cheaper, but does it compensate for the housing and health insurance costs? Because it's a much smaller part of a families expenses.

Softforks are more conservative and safe, because you don't force all nodes to upgrade to the same version at once, which can be catastrophic if that version has a bug. 
Segwit2x is a perfect example, the software had an off-by-one bug that would have caused the network to halt 1 block before the fork.
With a soft-fork lots of people can keep running older versions that are known to work well, so you don't risk a network outage or catastrophic failure.
It also leads to less confusion and makes coordination less necessary, if some people are unaware of the upgrade or unable to apply it.

b is the native segwit address format and is probably the one you want except for compatibility reasons.
Adresses that start with 3 are a more general and backwards compatible format that is used for multisig/p2sh.
With bech32 (the ones that start with b) the address is shorter, includes a checksum to prevent mistakes when copying the address by hand, and allows for native segwit transactions, which are slightly smaller. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:50:04
You're right, but they can't do error correction. Bech32 detects all errors of &lt;= 4 characters and can do error correction (although wallets shouldn't correct automatically because it is not reliable if the error is greater than 4 characters, so they should just suggest it, i.e: "it seems like you made a mistake here and it should be X")

@_date: 2018-01-07 19:12:57


Maybe, but that's probably because most of those things are luxuries that people don't consider as important.


It doesn't, it just frustrates me.




I'm not informed about all the items they include, it just seems that they probably include things that aren't very relevant.
- [Rents are increasing over 3.5% YoY since 2015](
- [Healthcare is increasing more than 2.5% YoY since 2014 and even 4% in 2016](
- [Food andbeverages are averaging 1%](
Are these not the main _necessary_ expenses of families? For CPI to average out to 2% that means it's also including other less necessary expenses like cars, which poorer families don't buy new or don't buy at all in favor of public transportation, computers, etc.
I realize that the CPI is trying to reflect the average spending but that might not be the most important metric when trying to improve the lives of people.
So maybe CPI is correct for the average person who also spends money on lots of other things that they don't need and that are going down in price but poorer families seem to be getting screwed and are stuck with stagnating wages, and the CPI doesn't show that.

In that case you can just pre-sign the transaction and have the server broadcast it. No need to complicate by making the recipient decrypt it. Even if the fee is too low it will work because of child-pays-for-parent.

This would be avoided with my suggestion, if it's possible, because you'd simply ask your desired recipient for an address. That way they wouldn't need to know your keys, they would simply need to wait some amount of time for the transaction to execute automatically and transfer the funds to them.
@_date: 2019-07-13 02:13:20


That's not how blockchains (and Bitcoin) work, the amount of the transaction is irrelevant to the fee or time to confirm, for good reason. LN is a bit different and you do pay per amount, also for good reason.

Why would it need to irrevocable? In fact you'd want it to be revocable, because you probably don't expect to die immediately after setting it up so you'll want to be able to use the funds.


Not at all, the Bitcoin network would execute it, just like it executes the smart contracts used by the lightning network.


It doesn't, but if X years pass the transaction becomes spendable by your intended recipient. If you use any of the funds beforehand it will no longer be valid,  so each time you spend from that wallet the wallet software will create a new "X years from now to adress Y" transaction with the change.


Yes, this is what I'm thinking about. Why would you want to lose access to the funds while you're still alive?

Right now people just price things in USD and trade the equivalent amount of BTC at the time. 
As more and more speculators trade it the price stabilizes, just like any other asset outside of important events.

I can try to help :) 


new_wallet_address_key_1 = f(seed_of_new_address)
And then new_wallet_address_key_2 = f(new_wallet_address_key_1)
But then you can not just somehow force it into using the old addressses.
Let's say you want to swipe key2 into the new wallet. You give it key2 and what it does is simply move the coins from key2 to, for example, new_wallet_address_key_1. This way all you need to keep is seed_of_new_address.




As they generate the private/public key for the 1st address and from there on you get access every next one as well. 
I don't think I understood what your question was here but hopefully what I wrote above answers it.


Importing is more complex, yes, and different wallets might handle this differently or not handle it at all. You would need to keep both the new wallet seed and either the seed of the original wallet or the private key for the imported address. Some wallets might have a backup file feature that bundles its seed along with all imported private keys.


This would not be the case because it is nearly impossible to guess what seed generated the private key, unless the pseudo random number generator that created the key had a security flaw. You can calculate the output of the function if you know the input, but not the reverse.


It depends on the implementation, if I had to make a guess most wallets probably use an extra step to prevent this.
Something like this:
    seed1 = f(12 word seed)
    key1 = g(seed1)
    seed2 = f(seed1)
    key2 = g(seed2)
Where `g` is a different function, maybe even just `f(x+1)`. There are multiple ways to construct this and this example is probably not accurate but I think it's enough to get the idea.


It definitely does! But these functions take so long to loop that it's not feasible for someone to calculate a significant portion of it.


Bitcoin uses Eliptic curve criptography, which unlike RSA, which might be what you're thinking about, doesn't require private keys to be prime numbers, they can be any integer number.


I might be confusing what you're asking but the 12 word seed is the number that allows you to calculate all the private keys of your wallet, because they are all calculated from it.

Obviously I can't see the future but I'd say we're at least 10 years away from that. 
I can easily see Bitcoin going into a long winter after the current stream of get rich quick "investors" realizes that it's not ready for day to day use. 
During that long winter the people who really believe in the idea will keep improving it, maybe we'll have one or two more big scaling ideas developed that make it ready for mainstream worldwide use. 
Blockchain will be used in videogames and to trade digital magic the gathering cards and Pokémon, probably also a few other things that no one in mainstream media will take seriously because they don't understand technology and can only see how expensive the suit of whoever is talking about it is. 
Maybe one of the big scaling ideas will come from research done by a big videogame company. Everyone will have a laugh at how the cosmetics from game whatever can now scale to more users than that Bitcoin thing that was a fad a few years ago and some people still take seriously.
Bitcoin will keep working, those improvements will be implemented and during the next worldwide recession it will do better than nearly any other investment because it has already fallen after the bubble and the only people holding onto it are the ones who really see the value and potential of it.
It will come back with a vengeance after the recession ends and people rediscover it as a now very usable currency that didn't fall during the crisis.


Bullshit, you just don't want to address them. I prefer stability to rotting money, Bitcoin won't have crazy deflation if it becomes mainstream, new Bitcoins won't even stop being created until 2140.
Gold did well for thousands of years, until fractional reserve banking joined forces with two world wars and a lot of dumb government policies to bring us the great depression, which now gets blamed entirely on the gold standard when the problem was that banks didn't have the gold reserves they claimed. 
And yet this single, badly explained, data point is used as the reason why inflation is necessary.
Fun fact, the US was on the gold standard during the 40's, 50's and 60's, the best growth period the country has ever seen. 
Now I would say gold had little to do with it, it was mostly from the US becoming the world's factory after Europe was destroyed, but this kind of nuance seems to be lost when discussing the great depression, all that matters is charts of GDP.

Thanks for your input. 
Your argument relies on the malicious actor/s being the representatives of the majority of the coins, though. 
Since representatives aren't rewarded with more coins and there's almost 0 friction to changing your representative I doubt that will be a problem long term. (It is a problem now because most people just started buying a week ago and because the dev team's representatives are the default they are still controlling over 50% of the voting power)

@_date: 2017-12-26 10:15:45
Ask yourself, why do we need PoW to decide the order of transactions if apparently all we need to do is disable RBF? 
The whole reason why non-RBF 0-conf transactions are harder to double spend is because there's a miner agreement to mine the first transaction they see if two competing transactions appear.
You're trusting that agreement to hold-up, but it only takes one miner to stop doing that to make 0-conf unreliable and insecure. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:26:03

Are you familiar with Raiblocks? I'd like to know your opinion on its PoS system.
If you're not familiar, here's the short version:
Every wallet can choose a representative, which can be yourself or anyone else. There's is no need to lock up funds. There is also no reward for the wallets or the representatives. 
Whenever there's a double spend, a vote is held to decide which transaction is kept. 
The vote of each node is weighted by how much coins it owns plus all the coins currently referring to it as their representative.
Assuming the majority of the network chooses representatives in a way that keeps the weight of each node below, for example, 1%, do you think there's still a big issue? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:45:38


That only works until there's a re-org and 80% of your nodes can no longer validate the new block. But yes, you can have pruning nodes, just not one block deep.


1 sec _per hop_ and _maxing out the 64Mbit/s connection to serve a single node_. You're also ignoring the time it takes each node to verify the block before passing it along. The real latency from China to the US won't be 1sec unless the nodes are directly connected and with a decent connection. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:14:19
Ok, so you clearly didn't get what I was saying. 
There's no difference, in terms of value loss, between buying something with Bitcoin and not buying Bitcoin with the USD you have to instead buy that something. 
As long as you replace the spent BTC, you're essentially in the same place after the purchase, it's just extra steps.
If you consider spending Bitcoin as a loss then you should be buying Bitcoin with the USD you have, because you're assuming close to 0 risk and near guaranteed return, so what sense does it make to keep USD if that's the way you're thinking?

No, that's not what I mean, that would require you to maintain a running computer to do that, and that computer would have your private key unencrypted because it would have to be able to operate without your intervention. 
What I'm talking about is using Bitcoin native scripting, which allows you to do smart contracts (although not as complex as Ethereum). 
I don't know if my suggestion would work because I don't know much about Bitcoin scripting but it sounds simpler than the smart contracts used by lightning network wallets, so it should be feasible.


Custodial solutions go against the spirit of Bitcoin and the community should avoid them whenever possible/practical. Not your keys, not your Bitcoin.

You can see how many BTC is locked up in payment channels, but estimating actual transactions is going to be hard.
Maybe if the biggest nodes make some statistics public, but you'll have to trust them and will still be possibly missing a lot of transactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:58:22


And how do you start up new nodes when  China decides to wipe out 60% of pruning nodes and probably 80% of archival nodes? Suddenly you have a massive strain on the network which may take weeks to resolve.
Or are you going to do checkpoints every other week? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:28:11
That's not the argument though. It's just a way to bust the dumb idea that Bitcoin will never be mainstream because it's complicated technology. 
The internet isn't even a rare example, pretty much anything that has to do with electricity is complicated and yet these things are all around us and used everyday by everyone. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:50:59


What do you mean totally unoptimized? 
We're talking about the ideal situation assuming 64Mb/s. If you think the network has better average bandwidth than that I guess that's something we can discuss and verify.
And no, they won't all move there, they'll just slowly become unprofitable against miners in China and drop out of the network. 
@_date: 2019-07-20 19:49:10


I think you're missing the point. I'm tying to find a workable and practical solution that works non-custodially.


That's not at all required for my suggestion, they never need to know your private keys. They just need to give the address that they would want to receive the funds at in case of your death. Your wallet and the Bitcoin network (and it's smart contract/scripting capabilities) would do the rest, trustlessly and non-custodially.


The Bitcoin network has much stronger guarantees of contract execution than the courts or the law.

@_date: 2017-12-30 19:29:37
Not the same person but let me try to explain more clearly:


Are you familiar with how a random number generator works? It's essentially a math function that takes a number and calculates a random looking number (but not really random because computers can't do that). Your wallet seed is the first number on a sequence that goes like this: 
    key1 = f(seed)
    key2 = f(key1)
    key3 = f(key2)
    etc
So the list can be infinite. As long as the seed is kept secure you can always regenerate the list (because the function always calculates the same output for a given input) and no one else can find out your keys because they don't know the seed (or one of the private keys in the sequence).


Sweeping is simple, you take one of your keys, for example key2, and transfer all the funds it contains to one of the accounts on a second wallet. So you have to backup the new wallet because key2 no longer has any funds, they are now on one of the new wallet's addresses.


No, at this point you have seed1 for wallet1 and seed2 for wallet2. If all of wallet1's addresses are empty you can forget it, otherwise you should keep backups of both seeds.


As I explained above they are not completely random, they are actually completely deterministic but based on a number that only you know. The 12 words are actually just the seed number, but represented in a way that makes it harder to make a mistake when backing up. 
I can go into more details if you like, but an end user doesn't need to know the details. As long as you keep a backup of the seeds for wallets with funds. you're good.

The new money doesn't go to directly to the citizens though, it goes through the financial industry so they can collect their rent. And money could also just increase in price, no need to print more of it to keep up with the economy (unless the smallest unit becomes too large, of course)
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:35:32


We're now up to _at least_ 0.5 seconds of verification per hop (assuming all the nodes are decent machines and aren't also doing other stuff, of course, like relaying transactions) plus _at least_ 1 second of full throughput on a 64Mbit/s connection. 
So you're getting 7.5 seconds of latency if you do 5 hops, which isn't a lot.
Now start re-evaluating some of these assumptions and you'll see that the propagation time is not at all negligible, like you were claiming.
It's not network breaking, but it's a noticeable advantage and incentive for  miners to locate themselves in the same region, leading to centralization. 
We already have the energy costs doing that, we should avoid adding extra reasons. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:38:38


I might have given you the wrong idea. 
They can't use their past representative status, only the current representatives vote, with their current weight before the new double spend transactions. 
Old double spends that have already been voted on can only be changed if you find the votes of a bigger share of coins that you didn't see before.

That's great, now how about you setup a node and see how long it actually takes to verify a 1MB block. Spoiler: it's not the same as a single round of Sha256 on a blob of serial data. It actually involves a bunch of table lookups to verify output validity, as well as checking the criptographic signatures, which are not just one round of Sha256. No, it's still not terribly slow, but that's _per hop_.

Having money that doesn't slowly rot seems like a decent one for starters, then you also get border-less currency thrown in for free.


That's a pretty big claim, what are you basing this on?


You're either being dense or dishonest, the comment _you are replying to_ explains that the argument isn't that complicated things always go mainstream, the argument is that complicated things aren't prevented from going mainstream.

Is the private key enough so you can generate the public key out of it? 
Precisely, the private key is enough to calculate your public key but the reverse is, of course, not true. 


Well, the swiped address should be empty unless you've transferred funds to it after swiping it. 
If you don't trust Coinomi then you should move all the funds that are in addresses that it knows the private key to. 


Well, it depends on what you want to know more about, it's a bit of a rabbit hole :) 




Well, true randomness is hard, especially in the security sense. You could for example have an antenna picking up random noise but then an attacker could blast radio signals to interfere and influence your random number generation. Or it could simply happen by accident. You get the idea. 
So instead we rely on information that comes only from the computers state itself, so that it can't influenced, purposefully or not, by the outside world. 
That has the drawback of making the random number generation a deterministic process, meaning that if you know the algorithm and the inputs, you can calculate the output. This is called "pseudo-random number generation", because if you can calculate it and predict it, it's not true randomness. 


The two big differences between them are security and performance. 
Depending on what you're using the (pseudo) random numbers for, you might not care if they are easy to predict and simply want them to be uniformly distributed and "random-looking". This would be the case if you're using them for simulations, games, etc. Such pseudo random numbers are usually seeded with easy to predict things, like the current time on the clock, and with algorithms that might make it very simple to guess what numbers are likely to be generated (you might not be able to predict the next number will be 578 but you might be able to predict that it will be a number between 500 and 600, because you know that it was generated between 10 and 15 minutes ago, for example). 
But if you are doing something where security is important, you absolutely care if they are easy to predict. In that case you don't just use a PRNG (pseudo random number generator), you use a CSPNRG (cryptographically secure PRNG). 
CSPNRG 's use much slower, more complex and hard to analyze algorithms while also being seeded with "better" randomness. These safer random numbers usually come from the OS itself (in Linux you would get them from `/dev/urandom`), which gathers as much random_ish_ data as it can get its transistors on, such as the movements from the mouse, keyboard inputs, CPU temperature, etc., mashes it all together and puts it through a CSPNRG before handing it to you. 
The non-secure PRNG's are much much faster so that's why you get both options. 
Sorry if I rambled a bit. Again, feel free to ask for more information if you want :)

Yes, this is annoying but opening several channels (like autopilot does) lowers the risk. Eventually LN payments will be able to split, route through multiple routes and combine at the destination, which makes having channels less of an annoyance. This can take a while to be ready, I agree.


I don't think this is as bad as people think, at least for most use cases of purchasing something at a shop or sending a payment to a friend that is close to you (splitting a bill, maybe).

@_date: 2017-02-21 16:51:48
AFAIK there are known encryption mechanisms that are resistant to Quantum computers. I think they can break Bitcoin's hashing algorithm (SHA-256) but not the signing algorithm (ECDSA). 
Thinking about it now, that's actually a bit scary. Miners wouldn't care about changing the signing algorithm but they would likely fight the change to a new hashing algorithm, since they have specialized hardware that would then be thrown away. This might mean that we'll keep the hashing algorithm far longer than we should. 
Or maybe SHA-256 is also Quantum computer safe, I'm not sure.

Well, since the lightning network is currently being tested (or so I've read) maybe a band-aid until 2019 is all we need, to give more time for testing and implementing it, and actually have people start using it.

I did, in the first comment.


You quoted me, but you didn't quite address what I was saying. Let's see:




Oh, was he? Then why did he say "I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Raegan"? This is taken straight from his press conference on Feb. 16. I don't think he even quite knew what he was talking about in a point brought up by him _in a press conference_. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that you didn't know this.




 (1st link. To avoid ad-wall)
"It's not just terror attacks."
WHAT TERROR ATTACKS?! Certainly not the ones Trump mentioned as being uncovered. You just brush it off and move on to an unrelated point you want to make.
"It's a hate crime in various European countries to report on who's committing the crimes and acts of terrorism. Here is just one example:"
No, your example doesn't mention hate crimes a single time, nor does it say it's illegal to report on Muslims. It's about a bunch of racist policeman and social workers who avoid pursuing cases with Muslim perpetrators.




How is that related to what I'm saying?  Do you think it's normal for him to start wasting time on campaign rallies just after starting his term? And please tell me where I'm not being reasoned and am instead being emotional, because you just threw that out there without explanation.

I gave it a quick overview (I don't have that good of a statistics understanding but I also don't try to trade), not even they are confident enough in their results. Maybe if they tried with more then one index (and one that isn't trash) the bias they see would disappear.

But the block reward will still exist for decades, we have full blocks now, with a very small user base. 
You agree it should scale more, so you agree that the current state isn't good for Bitcoin, no? 
I share your concerns about what happens when the block reward disappears but it's a problem we have decades to solve. By then we might have some technology even better than Bitcoin/blockchain. Or if not, the consensus might be to change to an eternal block reward of 0.3% per year like monero.

Still doesn't explain why Bitcoin would be a Ponzi and the dollar wouldn't.


I agree and good on you man. I do my best to avoid getting lost in hype.


Yes, because they _need_ to own fiat to pay their employees, pay their taxes and buy their resources. As more and more companies start to accept Bitcoin, the smaller that need will become. Bitcoin can become a store of value over time, as this happens more and more.


Agreed on the riskiness, but the risk comes from it's current adoption, it's not a permanent issue.
@_date: 2017-02-11 20:48:34
Probably a much bigger difference, because it won't completely overtake gold (it's still useful, pretty and does not need network access) and the USD isn't even the only fiat currency in the world, so $20T isn't the cap if you go for cash instead of gold.

You're explaing why it must eventually happen but not why it can't be in 5 years. We have until 2020 with the current block reward, so for at least 2 more years there's no rush.
 I'm already paying miners with enough inflation as it is, I don't see why I should give them more value with fees while they don't need it.
@_date: 2017-02-02 15:59:51
The scaling issues are not though, that's for sure.
@_date: 2017-02-22 20:20:34
No, it's just one transaction, but it becomes exponentially harder to reverse as more blocks are mined on top of the block that included your transaction. 
Maybe I'm going too low level but here we go:
Everyone is supposed to follow the longest chain of valid blocks. Each block takes a lot of computation to create. 
Hence, if someone wants to reverse your transaction they have to create blocks faster then the rest of the network (meaning they have more computational power than the rest of the network), since they will be starting at least one block behind the rest of the network and you can't create blocks instantly (valid ones, anyway). 
The more confirmations your transaction has, the further behind the attacker will have to start rewriting history, with each confirmation doubling the difficulty of pulling this off. 
As such, an attack is extremely unlikely. Having just 1 confirmation is a special case because it might get rewritten by coincidence, if two miners mine the next block at roughly the same time (happens sometimes), your transaction is only included in one of them and that's the block that gets thrown away. 
@_date: 2017-02-22 19:13:34

Or maybe they would just spend it on stuff they really want or need, instead of the wasteful lifestyle of the modern economy. 
But that's if you want to save and grow your money, you probably don't have all your money invested and you don't save pennies to invest in the stock market so it's not that different. 
@_date: 2017-02-22 10:58:11
Sounds like it's pretty cheap to attack the highly decentralized and robust network and slow it down to a crawl (and it's not like it's running when it's working fine, at 3tx/s)
@_date: 2017-02-05 16:16:25


What sort of tests are you talking about, then? 
@_date: 2017-02-22 19:47:23
It's how many blocks ago the transaction was included in the blockchain. The more blocks have passed (the more confirmations) the harder it is to somehow reverse it, even if someone controls more than half of the network. 
0 confirmations means it's not even in the blockchain yet, so you shouldn't trust that the transaction is safe. 
With 1 confirmation it can still be reversed if two blocks are created at roughly the same time (one of them will get ignored by the network after a few seconds) but unless there's an attack on the network (very expensive to do and therefore unlikely) I'd say 2 confirmations is a very strong guarantee.

How are you reaching the conclusion than in 15 years 0.7BTC won't be enough of a reward? 
Maybe you're right, why does the fee market have to start right now and not in 8 years? 
Starting the fee market now isn't good for Bitcoin because it's still struggling for adoption. 
If on top of not being accepted in many places the fees are also much higher than reasonable when compared to existing solutions we're limiting it's potential.

You said only people who contribute code can hope to understand the incentives in Bitcoin. I said that's a ridiculous assertion and nothing more than an argument from authority. 
Don't twist that into me saying that core developers can't understand Bitcoin's incentives and need help, like you implied with your example about NASA.
But let me use your example, by the way. You're saying that only the people who design the engine of the Saturn V can hope to understand how it gets to the moon. I'm saying that no, different fields can be understood by people with different qualifications. 
I can tell you how the orbital physics that allow the Saturn V to complete it's mission work, but I have no clue about aerodynamics. 
I can tell you the economic incentives for why miners mine, but I can't tell you how SHA-256 works. 
See what I'm saying?
There's a reason arguments from authority are considered a logical fallacy, maybe you should learn why.

Issues like transactions getting stuck for hours when blocks fill up. I don't think that's good for Bitcoin.

You can't really avoid bumpy increases in fees because the block reward changes in huge, rare steps. Changing the reward formula to much more frequent and smaller changes would help make fee increases less scary. 
Adding capacity to the blocks,  can lower fees without making them 0 (I don't think they'd ever be 0 unless a miner was validating out of charity). It would never be 0% to 100% because they wouldn't be at 0 in the first place. No one is even arguing for 0 fees, just that they should be small enough that you can actually use Bitcoin to buy stuff. 
Adding capacity (segwit or BU, I don't want to get into that discussion, you can like what you like) is the way to go, the more capacity you add to a block the less each transaction has to pay to reward the miners. If you can only fit one transaction, that transaction will pay 100% of the block reward. If instead you can fit 1 thousand then each transaction only needs to pay 0.1%, the miners reward doesn't change (ok, it marginally changes because he spends more computing time on validation and has higher risk of orphaning but the fee could be slightly more than 0.1%).

Block rewards can only be spent after 100 blocks. 51% isn't even close to being able to make a 100 block re-org happen, you need way more than that or else you're just throwing money in the trash with your attempt with a tiny chance of success.
Even 98% only gives you a roughly 10% chance of success of a 100 block re-org. 
With 51% it's 5.71*10^-30, lotteries are a much better idea than that.

Oh, in that case you can just tell docker to redirect those ports to whatever you want, problem solved. If you're using docker run I believe it's `docker run -p "8443:443" image_name` or something similar.
If you're using docker compose you add a section like so:
-ports: "8443:443"
Lookup the documention for whatever method you're using, but it can be done quite easily.
The port on the left is the port on your host, the one on the right is the port on the container. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 08:33:44
The costs are in the form of risk. Bigger blocks take longer to propagate so a miner doing big blocks has a bigger chance of getting the block orphaned, so the fees must pay enough so that his expected reward is still positive.

I work for a company whose sole purpose is to prevent credit card fraud.

There are several international companies doing this.
So there you go, not perfect, at all.

I agree with your points, what I was saying is that a miner making a huge block is kind of an irrelevant concern in the situation where they control 51% of the network.




These two already achieve the same as mining a 1TB block so why worry about a 1TB block? That's my point.
One thing, though:


Can't they reverse recent transactions made by other people by mining parallel blocks that don't include them and then prevent that transaction in all future blocks?

That's not spam (or doesn't have to be, I can't know for certain) , that's what you get when a few consecutive blocks fill up. People start retrying their transactions, which keeps the next blocks full and the mempool growing. Eventually people give up on their transactions and the network gets a chance to work through the backlog.

No, that's just the natural end-game for mining. Eventually people will be mining to heat their house or mining with excess electricity from their solar panels (which don't even need to be profitable activities, only reduce costs) so centralized players won't be able to make a profit.
It's too early for that because mining chips are still too expensive upfront, but manufactured at scale they would probably be cheaper than budget CPU's and could thus be integrated into space-heaters or water-heaters. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:28:05

Right now, yes, they're very expensive, but what I've been trying to tell you is that eventually they won't be, because they are quite simple, as long as there's some competition in manufacturing those prices will crash down to where they should be: below the prices of budget CPU's.




So even 1 million miners wouldn't be enough decentralization? It has to be more than half the population on earth? That doesn't seem ridiculous to you?


Sure, but is "a lot less security" not still stupidly secure, since we're talking about something like hundreds of thousands of people?


"they already did" doesn't matter, that's just a consequence of having 1 company making miners because the whole space is still a complete gamble and there aren't many companies willing to take the risk. As time goes on you'll get more manufacturers.

I'd take the risk if it cost less than $150 and was already hard to improve. Lots of other people would too, at that price point it can be seen as a hobby and no longer as a risky investment.


How many millions of raspberry pi's are gathering dust? When you get cheap enough people don't really care about turning a profit anymore, they might just buy it to play with it a bit even if they don't expect a return.

@_date: 2017-08-24 18:14:16
It's determined by supply and demand of space on the blocks. Transactions take up space and the blocks are limited to 1MB. Miners choose the transactions that pay more for the space they take up, so that they maximize profit. No central authority decides the fees. 
@_date: 2017-01-21 18:51:47
So if we reduce the block size to 0.5MB we remove a lot of attack vectors? What are you talking about, exactly? 
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:47:32


Segwit isn't active, LN isn't in use, why are you assuming the fees will be the same? 
If 1 extra transaction a month is cost prohibitive then so is opening and closing more than one channel a month, anyway, that's why I said it didn't really matter to the discussion. 


Then don't, there are other options. No one is forcing you to use it right now, wait for the improvements.

Are you talking about ASICBoost? If everyone does it it ceases to be an advantage.


Depends on the season (which is different for both hemispheres). During spring and summer you'll have extra power from solar panels instead.


It doesn't work yet because the chips are still way too expensive because they are made in small quantities by only 1 company, so the upfront cost is so large that you'll never recuperate that cost just by heating your home occasionally.


What makes you say that? They are incredibly simple chips with a lot of tolerance for defects, unlike CPU's. I don't see how they can be more expensive than mobile phone CPU's, when produced at scale.


That just makes phones slow, laptops noisy and kills the battery of both. Plus, a single ASIC chip beats millions of phones, I don't think even Facebook could get a sizeable enough chunk just on that.


Ok, the ASIC can now compete with hundreds of millions of phones.


But you don't have to use the same kinds of computers...


Ah, ok, so we're talking about something like Monero. 


No, it begs to be trivially optimized by whoever wants to work on it, which means you quickly reach the limits of fabs in terms of transistor size and eventually it gets commoditized and cheaper than an h.264 video decoder chip (which is much more complex) for phones.
What we have right now is the consequence of basically only one company bothering to manufacture ASIC's because it's still wildly risky. It's not the end state of mining competition.

And the fucking thing is open source, anyone can take the work they've done and change it however they want, such as what the BCH guy did. So if no one made BCH sooner it wasn't Core's fault, they're not in charge and there are no barriers to forking their code. 


Yes it is. Look up transaction malleability and how the Lightning Network works. 


Sure, but BCH isn't either.

It's going to have a block size increase in less than a day, when segwit activates. 
LN is also really close, or at least part of it, there's already a beta Android wallet for testnet (it's called Eclair wallet, if you want to try it) that lets you do LN payments. It's not bidirectional (sending and receiving) because for that to be secure the wallet needs to monitor the blockchain periodically and its a more complicated feature, but it'll be done eventually.
But no, LN isn't the end of the scaling struggle. It is really _really_ cool though!

Well, you're in luck, no single miner can do it. Because nodes and the economic majority would reject it as invalid. 


So if a new fork creates a trillion Bitcoin and distributes to all the miners you'd consider that valid as long at it had the biggest PoW (which it probably would)? No, no hombre. 
If you run a node you can validate every block and make sure it follows all the rules. _That's_ trustless, not blindly following PoW. I don't know where you got that idea from but you'll be hard-pressed to find people that know what they're talking about and agree with that. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:13:45
You can keep the channel open for a whole month, for example. It's not an issue to re-open a channel every once in a while, I think. And it takes about as long as a normal on-chain transaction anyway.

I did something similar with [one of these]( It's tiny and the battery lasts for about 5 days with the screen constantly on and updating every 30 minutes. The screen is very small so it only shows the price, the 24h % change and my total profit so far.

Well, me and most people I know don't or do only slightly more than 24 a week. We make maybe 2 or 3 a day for food, plus an extra 2 or 3 per week for groceries and some 5 a month for bills and gas. So in the worst case that's about 25 a week. 
But whatever, maybe lots of people make many more than that, it still makes no sense to create a channel for a single transaction, just use a normal transaction in that case. 


All channels should be reused, otherwise there's no point. Your power bill is only 12 transactions per year, it doesn't really matter in terms of scaling. Still, maybe you could pay per trimester. 


Agreed, but it's certainly not one per transaction, that'd be worse than on-chain because using a channel only once would mean 2 on-chain transactions (open and close) instead of one.

Because the extra size will have to be stored forever, while doing it in reverse order you know you're only storing forever the absolutely necessary. 
It also gives more time to do a proper hard fork that includes several changes at once instead of forcing people to upgrade multiple times. 


I don't know how this is even a question, if you want to scale to 100x more transactions you'll need 100x bigger blocks and that would still be roughly only  300tx/s, how does that sound reasonably viable to you? 


But off-chain is optional, so what's the issue? 


It's not the same at all, you have full ownership of the money on an LN channel, no one can steal it from you and you car recover the money at any time. 


What subservience do you have to LN nodes? They can't do anything more than miners already can, but you can also avoid LN nodes by transacting on-chain if needed.

Enthusiasts have far less cost than professional operations. They don't pay for space, they don't pay salaries and they may not even mind running at a loss as long as it's small. That will have an effect on network difficulty.

You're concentrating on the wrong thing. The number of nodes doesn't matter, what matters is who is running them and who is connecting to them. 
If I run my own node I trust my node over all the other nodes out there. 
Then all the users that connect to exchanges or use wallets that connect to nodes also get their truth from those nodes, which are very likely validating all blocks. 
So yes, nodes matter, a lot actually. It's just that the number of them doesn't matter much, at least without any other context.

They can also send you an on-chain transaction as a refund.

@_date: 2018-06-07 22:43:18


No, even in that case more hashpower means more security, because that one guy has to find an attack that will be more profitable than $X/hour of attack. If X is $5, pretty much anything is worth it to him. If X is $5 million, it's going to be a bit harder to find a profitable attack.


Completely agree. Decentralization is way more important than hashpower. But all else equal, higher hashing power is still useful.

The loan itself is renting money, what you do with it is another story. What I suggested is to rent the house instead of the money, and use the extra money to buy investments, so you're not throwing money away either.


That depends on where you live, in some places house prices are crazier than rents and renting easily becomes the better financial option.


Depends on where you live.


Can you go ahead and give me some quotes? 
Because this is just straight up math, you plug in the data for your interest rate, housing data for your region and how you assume the house/investments will appreciate and you get the answer for which makes more sense.
I don't see how a (good) economist can claim that buying is always the better option.

Sure, it's two clicks because the browser needs to open the wallet program. Eventually someone will make a browser extension and it'll work with two clicks if that really is a problem. Maybe it already exists, it doesn't bother me so I haven't looked.


That's handles by the button you click to open the wallet, it already points to the address.


LN is as fast as PayPal but is another layer, yes. But PayPal is also another layer on top of bank accounts so it's not that different ��‍♂️


Escrow service is not a bank, at all. And with Bitcoin multi-sig wallets they don't even need to have control over your money, they can only approve or decline a transaction. I can go into more detail if you want.


Withdrawing isn't difficult at all and I'd prefer to have guaranteed access to the funds.


No, but you should always have an emergency fund of a decent size.


But that might force you to sell those assets at a loss if the reason you need the emergency fund is that we're in a recession. Currencies tend to be more stable (Bitcoin is obviously not there yet).


Presumably you didn't get hit if you complied, so you might have some trouble proving it. But yes, if someone goes into your house and forces you to give them access to your funds you have a better chance of recovering fiat than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-23 11:15:03
Ok, good point. 
Although if you're betting on the value going up you can hold the mined coins and shorten the time it takes to pay for itself (if you're right).
If you're wrong and the value stagnates or goes down mining would still let you recover your money while buying would just be a loss. 
I guess it's a trade-off between risk and profit.

We're talking about a situation where people know that having their keys is better. Holding cash is less convenient for large amounts of money, not so with Bitcoin. 


You wouldn't loan money to let it sit on the bank earning less interest than you have to pay for the loan.


Yes, but fewer people would use banks for storing most of their Bitcoin. Storing large amounts of cash at home is more dangerous than leaving them at the bank but with Bitcoin the inverse is true (unless you're not good with technology).

What you linked is a presentation proposal, it has no data whatsoever. 
Processing time isn't all that matters, we also care about latency, bandwith requirements and costs.


Even if they do, the base layer remains decentralised. Plus, centralization in LN isn't even that likely (because of how easy and cheap it is to run a hub) and isn't a big problem, they can't censor your transactions because you can always go through the base layer.


Your point ignores the higher costs of participating in the BCH network, with 8MB blocks _maybe_ they would be similarly decentralized (right now it's not) but BCH would need to keep increasing the blocksize  more and more, and at some point you would start to notice the consequences.
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:44:22


Actually yes, I can. BTC added an optional transaction format, you can still use the normal one and have your signature in the usual place. BCH changed the difficulty adjustment algorithm (twice now) which caused all sorts of shenanigans and affected everyone that uses it as well as people using BTC. Not that it matters, having the least changes isn't what's relevant. 


It doesn't, that doesn't matter, the problem is first using a similar name and later trying to claim it to be the original chain, while having a clear minority of users, businesses and hashrate. That's the fraud part. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:05:21


How is it not correct? If going from 1MB to 8MB doesn't increase processing, bandwidth and storage requirements does that mean you can also go to 1TB blocks with no cost increase?

You can do the same with Bitcoin, there are wallets for Windows Linux and Mac.


You can, you just need to buy on a service that has escrow services, like purse.io.


Sure, it's too much for some people like the elderly, which can struggle even to use an ATM. 
But for most people it's not complicated at all, it's not obvious because it's different from online banking but that doesn't make it complicated.


You're not going to earn any noticeable interest on a few months of a small consumer loan...


But in that time you don't have the money, we're talking about after you get the loan.


Sure, but those options aren't liquid or convenient enough to be used as currency. Especially in the modern age where so much economic activity happens online.

Yes, I'm incentivized to risk my savings, which makes my life less stable and makes me less able to handle unexpected events in my life. I'm pretty sure this effect makes recessions hit harder.


The first three are unproductive and lead to waste, but because of forced inflation, they actually can be better than storing cash.


Basically what Austrian economics have been warning about for decades, that financial tricks don't create resources and that a system based on ever-growing national debt is unsustainable and just kicks the can down the road, turns out to be unsustainable.


It's immoral on its face. A few select institutions are paid to lend money to others and collect rent, as if the rent wasn't already enough.




Wasting absurd amounts of money to build a gigantic wall that tries to stop a problem that has been shrinking for decades must be awesome for the economy. There's clearly no better way to spend both the money and the resources that will go into it (both raw resources and man-hours) 


You're actually arguing that the broken window is a net positive, wow. So it's good to eliminate safety nets from the economy and keep everyone as close to paycheck to paycheck as possible? This is why we now have a problem that apparently needs  negative interest rates to be solved. If the economy had plenty of savings recessions wouldn't cause so much harm, because lots of people wouldn't be struggling so much and wouldn't cut their spending as much.

Not really, you scan a QR code, double check the fee and hit send. There is some complexity in avoiding fees but it's improving a lot with things like LN.
But holding your keys makes it easier to avoid high fees, not harder.


It's not difficult at all, you just need to know the options. A hardware wallet for large amounts, your phone protected with fingerprint for small amounts and a backup of those keys on paper in a secure location, done.


True, but if the interest isn't high enough why would people care? My bank pays 0.5%/year on long term deposits, I don't care enough to set it up.


If you're not going to use the money why did you take the loan? That makes no sense, you're just losing money in that case.


Sure, but those don't allow banks to print more money so they're not relevant to the conversation. 


Large amounts of cash are hard to hide, a Bitcoin seed isn't. And you can encrypt it with a password to make it even safer, but that's why I said it's not as safe if you're not good with technology.

Both change the protocol, don't give me that bullshit. One is optional and didn't cause any issues, the other negatively affects not only all users of the coin but also all users of coins with the same PoW. The second one is so bad it needed  another hardfork not even 3 months later.

If they leave (at the same time?) and don't have time to give an overview to someone, you get someone else to read the code and documentation, just like any new engineer on a project does. The project slows down a bit because of this but it's in now way the death of the project. 
My company has multiple projects with one or two people, it works fine.

That's anywhere from half a minute to 4 minutes of latency _per hop_. Probably a bit better with thin blocks but that's still an absurd amount of latency when it comes to mining, it gives a massive regional advantage to whoever the biggest group of miners is (hint: China, especially with the added latency from the big firewall).


That's for simple hubbed channels, LN includes routing which means you'll probably end up with multiple possible paths between the two adresses.


You mean this? 


Needs beefier computers, more bandwidth and more storage space.

Isn't that an equivalent problem to not receiving the transaction in the first place? Any GUI wallet shouldn't show the received transaction until it's written to disk, so you don't do the trade if for some reason your computer crashes.

No, there's also MAST and Schnorr signatures which can make transactions smaller. LN isn't the only thing being worked on even though that's all that r/btc talks about.

LN has other advantages, like instant payments. Block size increases increase the block chain size and bandwidth requirements. It's not an issue if you don't care about decentralization, like BCH doesn't seem to care.

Honestly, it's really not. With LN you don't need to create an account, read terms of service and add and verify your credit card. 
You just install the wallet, transfer Bitcoin to it and then create one or more channels. But sure, in some ways it's also more complicated, it's pre-paid instead of being automatically withdrawn.


But with far less control than what exists for the current financial system.

Your best bet is a ledger or Trezor (I prefer the Trezor because it's open source).
Next best thing would be a wallet on your phone if the phone is encrypted and protected with pin or fingerprint.
After that I would use a wallet like Electrum on a computer you trust not to be stolen or to easily run malicious programs (Linux/Mac over Windows).
Any of those three options will tell you to backup the wallet seed (sort of a password), to protect from hardware failure or device loss. You can keep it in paper at home if you thinks
 it's safe, or you can write it to an encrypted file and store it on another device.

If you have a good chunk of money in Bitcoin the best thing is to get a hardware wallet, like a Ledger or a Trezor (I prefer the Trezor because it's open source and open design).
If you don't want to spend anything the next best thing is your phone, then a Linux PC and the worst is a Windows PC because of how targeted they are by malware. Electrum wallet runs on all of them and is free and open source.
Whatever option you choose, make sure you have a backup of the wallet seed, in case of hardware failure or if you lose your device.

I'd also like to know, I've only used Eclair, but I guess any answers you get will quickly become outdated because all three projects are constantly adding new features.
From a technology perspective I think Eclair is written in Scala and C-lightning is written in C, so I would expect C-lightning to be less safe because of the well-known difficulty of writing safe C code. 
But I haven't inspected the code quality of any of them and that's more important than the language it's written on.

Go isn't C, it's native and has a bootstrapped compiler. 
But it doesn't matter, your language interpreter/compiler is much more battle-tested than whatever code your team is writing, so the likelihood of running into issues with C is orders of magnitude lower in that case.
It's not about trusting the language or not, every language has features that help avoid bugs and design issues that make bugs more likely or more dangerous.
Bugs in C code tend to be a lot more dangerous than bugs in Java/Go/Rust/Python/etc.

You're the one pretending it's binary, assuming that if blockspace has any value  blocks will completely full. This is clearly false because it has value now but blocks aren't always full.


I don't think it creates that expectation, segwit increased capacity but there's no expectation that blocks will never be full.


But with increased capacity each user will have to pay a smaller fee for the same total.


I do, I love using LN and I understand that scaling is a hard problem. I just disagree that we can never increase blocksizes, it's not like 1MB or 4MB block weight were carefully chosen values that we know to be optimal.

Of course not, but it definitely tracks where the digital money it prints is (which banks). If all the bank FED accounts are multiple times smaller than the deposits at those banks, that means those banks printed money among themselves, which is legal and expected.

That's a subtle way of saying you don't really have strong technical arguments.


And also because of that trust/risk thing, because you're handing over your dollars to banks and completely losing control of them. It's not just a regulations problem.


Whats shitty about it? You actually pay fewer fees and are protected from transaction malleability.


That's an emotional argument. It's also wrong, blocks are bigger than 1MB with segwit.


No, it's to avoid a hard-fork while we still have scaling solutions that don't need one. When we run out of those we'll be able to bundle a bunch of nice changes into a single hard-fork that can be prepared with lots of time in advance.

It's not as extreme as what you're saying, being in a 1% hashrate pool means your pool is expected to on average mine 1.44 blocks a day (there are 144 blocks per day), so there's really no need to be on one of the top 3 pools to pay your bills.

Many of the smaller pools have existed for years, you're not really taking a chance.
Try one with 5%, you'll still get payouts multiple times a day.


Increasing decentralization increases the value of your assets, and some of those smaller pools also take a smaller cut of your payout.


Yeah, that's what I'm trying to figure out, it seems to me like an important issue to solve. 
So far the answers seem to be about payout frequency and predictability, which aren't a problem for small (1%) pools but definitely are for tiny (&lt; 0.05%) ones.

Person A deposits $100 dollars. The bank loans $90 to person B, who buys a bicycle from merchant C. Merchant C deposits their $90.
There are now $190 readily accessible dollars in the economy even though only $100 existed at first. The owed $90 will only be paid back in the future so for now there is extra imaginary money in the economy, created by the bank.
This is called fractional reserve banking, in most countries the required reserves are between 5 and 15%. It is common practice, just look it up.
Notice on page 44 of the PDF you linked how the bank's account balance at the Federal Reserve is much smaller than the amount of deposits? That's because the deposits are already under this multiplication effect that doesn't reflect the amount of money issued/stored at the FED.

Fractional reserve has nothing to do with national currencies. It's just the entity that is supposed to hold the backing asset actually not holding 1:1 reserves but a fraction of them.


Sure, and then when everyone tries to withdraw, surprise! There isn't enough gold for everyone because the bank/government sold some of it for profit.
Crypto currencies can already be supply limited, there's no point in backing them with another asset except to sort of link their price to the underlying asset. But you're adding counter-party risk, which sucks.

But on a smaller pool your payouts are bigger, since you're a bigger share of the hashrate, so it should take the same amount of time to reach the minimum amount.

Reading the whitepaper and reading posts and comments about cryptocurrencies occasionally over the last year. I'm also a software engineer, that helps.


The main chain isn't an objective thing, it's just the chain that most people decide that it has the rules they want and follow. Some Bitcoin Cash supporters say they are the main chain, for example, but they're a minority. 
I guess it's correlated with number of transactions but making thousands of fake transactions wouldn't make an unused chain the "main chain" in the eyes of anyone reasonable.


Perhaps, if most of the economy changes to a different chain. But then that chain would probably keep the Bitcoin name, so it would only be a problem if you were part of the minority that would want to keep the transacting on the original chain. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:38:03
I mean small compared to the top pools, the top 3 combined have roughly 50% of the hashrate. If most pools only had 1% each everyone would be much more comfortable.
Even worse is that the 2 biggest pools are controlled by people who dislike Bitcoin and want to see BCH "win", so it's not even that unlikely that they would work together to attack Bitcoin and destroy its reputation of being secure.

It can and it has been a few times already. You need a good amount of mining power plus economic support from users and important economic entities, such as exchanges. Whatever chain the economy follows is essentially what we call Bitcoin. 
Anyone can propose the change (as software) and if most miners and users run that software it enforces the new rules and the rules change.
An important point is that users/miners that don't change to the new software will keep following the old rules, so if the new rules are incompatible you get a fork (2 chains with different rules). The one with the biggest amount of support will probably keep the Bitcoin name and the other will get called something else.
This is the meaning of decentralization: no one is in control, it's all based on voluntarily agreement among the majority of users. And the minorities aren't forced to follow the majority, they get to do their own thing if they want.

Well, the chains have the same history up until the block when they fork into separate chains, so you have the same balance in both unless you move funds _after_ the fork.
So for example, with Bitcoin Cash, on August 1st both Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) had the same history (same blocks) but then Bitcoin rejected the first block with more than 1MB and the Bitcoin Cash accepted it (they enforce different rules). 
From then on they are building on top of different blocks and what you do in one doesn't affect the other one, but the balance of all accounts on the moment of the fork is the same.
You can then sell what you have on one chain to buy more of the other if someone is willing to make the trade. So if you had 1BTC prior to August 1st you now have 1BTC + 1BCH and you can trade the 1BCH for xBTC and end up with 1+xBTC, x being whatever someone is willing to trade for your 1BCH.

Not impossible, you can transfer Bitcoin to a second wallet you own and then, after it confirms, sell the B2X from the original wallet.
If the first transaction is replayed you don't lose coins and the second one fails. 
If the second transaction is replayed it will fail to confirm on the Bitcoin chain because the funds have already been moved.

It does matter. As long as the deflation isn't way too high it all adjusts, interest will be very low because otherwise people won't take out loans and because even 0.2% interest a year will also include the value increase of Bitcoin.


So you seize property, as usual. How often does someone stop paying loans but still has a bunch of money sitting on their bank account?


You're assuming some really high deflation here, new Bitcoin won't even stop being created for another 100 years, by then I think the volatility and high price increases should be done as the technology settles and most people already use it (if it happens).


Why is this different from buying gold or stocks right now and doing the same thing?


Bullshit. Why aren't all loans high risk right now, then, if people can just buy gold and bury it in their backyard already? Because most people are honest and pay back debt, and so lending to most people isn't that risky as long as they have a job.

The original depositor (A) has $100 dollars and the merchant (C) has $90, for a total of $190 just on the first iteration. The person that took out the loan (B) owes ~$90 but it only has to be paid in the future, so that doesn't immediately affect the money available in the economy.

Doesn't that make it even harder to verify the value? 


But if you do it for a lot of coins can't you process them all more or less in one go, making it still profitable?


That is no longer gold and leads to counter-party risk/fraud.


True, but the issue with verifying the value still applies.


But there are larger notes, if weight becomes an issue you'll use bigger notes, not stacks of 1's.


It actually can, because it can't adapt as easily to different situations like notes can.


You've never received a damaged note? I've even received notes that were ripped and glued back together with tape.


I do, as long as it's more than half you can trade it for a new one at the bank.


No, you just get it replaced at the bank.


I opened a bunch of links and they're about counterfeiting prevention and machine readable features. None of these help a person verify coins in their day to day.

Gold is worth too much to make small change coins that are practical. A fiat coin or note with a chunk missing is still worth the same, a gold coin with a chunk missing definitely isn't.


I think you switched those by accident


Oh, you're serious... No, notes are lighter per dollar value than gold.


Except in the case where the weight of the notes would be a problem. If someone is carrying $1 bills, they aren't worried about the weight.


I'm not familiar, is this still true for gold coins or does it assume that the coin is made of cheaper materials? Can you share a link?


But if you shave a small portion and the recepient doesn't notice, no value is lost to you because the coin will be accepted at face value.

Forge, yes, but if it was made of gold I don't think it would be too hard to file down the 12 sides and then trade the coins at shops. It wouldn't even need to be very lucrative, one person could just do it while watching TV or something like that, and make a few extra bucks by going through a bunch of coins.

A very expensive and useless one, which is an absurd idea. 
What likely happened is that more users started using Bitcoin but over time the high fees made many users give up on frequent transactions and now do less transactions than they want. 
I'm one of those users, if I'm paying upwards of $1 per tx you can be sure I won't be using it daily.

It still seems like the wrong response, OpenSSL is a lot more battle hardened then their new solution, they should have better arguments than simply removing dependencies.
They can audit the code instead of starting from scratch.
With their experience with cryptography it might be viable to implement their own simpler solution that only does what they need. I trust them but am cautious about this decision if that's all there is to it.

"The Federal reserve and the government stand behind it _and_ when you hold your dollars in a bank account you have deposit insurance".

PayPal can hold your funds hostage, an LN node can't.
There aren't many competitors to PayPal that are widely accepted, because each new one has to build up their brand, make deals and get businesses to integrate with them. 
 There are at least a few dozens of alternatives for these big LN nodes that will still be accepted in the same places that the big ones are, because the design of the system doesn't rely on a single one of them and they all use the same API.

Can you expand on this? Are you talking about the liquidity requirements? That might happen, except the banks don't have large amounts of Bitcoin, Bitcoiners do. And most transactions have low amounts anyway, the liquidity requirements might not be a big issue 


The same was said about Bitcoin itself. There is no single entity or small group of entities to go after, so it's hard to shut down. 


Can you elaborate on this? You can reject an attempt (if you even know who it is, which you probably won't because of the onion routing) but then the payment will just be routed through someone else.

So you're saying crypto will never be used, basically.


You make it sound like you can create a routing channel accidentally. You don't, and if you make a routing channel you know you can't count on it being available for day to day.


It can be managed automatically by changing fees in each direction.

I don't follow what you see as so different. If Walmart won't take Escobar's money what difference does it make if he's using BTC on-chain or via LN? 


You keep making it sound like this is something that can happen by accident. No, unless you're running a server with command line nodes no one will be able to just route through your channels, none of the current user friendly LN clients allow this and I don't see why they would.


Yeah, which is exactly what we don't want. We want routing nodes to be managed seriously, they get paid with fees and they keep their shit up and running, which mitigates your point about uptime.


Ok that I agree, of course. It's worse than Bitcoin in several ways, better in others.


It might happen, but eventually the blocksize will be increased, when we run out of better alternatives to increase capacity. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 10:35:43

Miners actively accept the transactions they put into blocks, so what's the difference? They can just regulate the miners.


Not sure if you're aware but LN uses onion routing, the "money movers" don't even know the source or destination of the transfer.
This would actually be easier to enforce with miners.


They're paid for it, I doubt they'll be rare. They're not rare _now_, while the consensus is still that "nobody uses LN".


Even if that happened it would still be a massive improvement over the current system, LN nodes have very little power.


They already did, with segwit.


Good thing they did, maybe you're not aware but 2X had a critical bug that would have halted the network as soon as it activated. Essentially it was an off by one error. It was rushed, Core doesn't do rushed. 
And that "deal" was a joke, a bunch of companies got together and pretended to speak for everyone, devs included.


You're not being honest, the argument isn't that 2MB is too big, it's that hard-forks should be avoided if possible. Segwit increased the blocksize to roughly 2MB, for example.
