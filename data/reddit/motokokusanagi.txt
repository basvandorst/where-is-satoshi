Hey Pine,
Amazing work you're doing here. Something that would actually be really cool is a website that lists the donations you've made so far and why, along with some useful information for other people, such as 'donating cryptocurrencies to x location - taxes' etc.
Doesn't have to be anything major but a simple wordpress site would do it, twitter account for people to follow and keep up to date on things.
Just a thought though.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:58:02
Awesome stuff! Please keep this up!

Hey Limping,
Thanks for posting this and sticking around to answer questions. I've been looking into immersion cooling quite a bit over the last year. 
To the point where I was about to get some 3m Novec fluid and give it a test ala: 
If possible, i'd greatly appreciate your thoughts on the following, and thanks in advance for your help:
1: The fluid, I did look below but can't see anything, are you able to say what fluid you're using? Seems like an oil that's cooled via a heat exchanger like you say over evaporation &gt; condensation. Do you feel this oil is the most cost effective over a 3m Novec fluid?
2: You say $20k for the VAT. Is there any particular reason you can't build a DIY one for much cheaper?
3: You say it's connected to a garden hose to cool it down, do you just keep this hose running all the time then? Any issue with cost of water use?
Thanks for your time! 
@_date: 2017-10-31 09:37:12
So I WFH and use my computer a lot for gaming etc. Would running a full node have an impact on gaming performance if I left it running 24/7? 
Also it mentions people have put viruses into the blockchain, is there a risk of getting a computer infected?
Any work arounds for the above? Also can I just set it up and leave it running (once setup to reject 2x)?
@_date: 2018-02-26 14:09:00
Well done all involved! Thank you!

Tomato trebuchet &gt; decentralised currency :) 
@_date: 2017-07-14 08:58:34
Whoever this person is is intelligent enough to know that going against a monetary system is going to upset a LOT of some of the most powerful people in the WORLD, who rely on the monetary system not changing.
If they did have a public identity, then the **idea** of a decentralised currency could be attacked through that public identity. Think Julian Assange and the whole sexual assault charges &gt; wikileaks.
Because there isn't a public figure, all that's left is the **idea**. And an idea is a hell of a lot harder to destroy than someone's image.
It's beautifully planned.
Satoshi Nakamoto if you're out there thank you! And if you're willing to donate 000000000001% of your worth so I can build my protest tomato trebuchet that would be sweet :) 13RZjg77mt43reHmcqz8UhSXrQjv6yNpjc

So if the 2MB hard fork gets 100% miner support. Am I right in saying that there's still technically a 'split' in the blockchain, as the 2MB change isn't backwards compatible. 
The difference being no-one will really care about this 'split' and the focus will just be on the 2MB hard fork?
Whereas the 'bitcoin split' would be 2MB chain vs non 2MB chain, with the non 2MB chain only having any value because certain % of people would rally behind it?
@_date: 2017-07-18 17:13:24
I think i'm going insane, where are you seeing this 75.8% figure on those sites listed above? Cheers
@_date: 2017-07-18 14:08:45
Wait so we've gone past the 80% signalling threshold? 
Just need to ensure it stays above 80% during the next signalling block?

Hey dude, congrats on being an early adopter, really helps the bitcoin community!
Just curious, at what stage do people pay? Do people pay to download the tracks?
Also what are your opinions on running your website on bitcoin micro transactions instead of adverts?
The idea being that people pay £0.10 / £0.20 / or whatever they feel per month to fund the site. Obviously this depends on the amount of traffic you have, the amount of people using bitcoins and the consumer behaviour behind it, but based on what you know about your site, do you think it's a viable option?
For example you take all adverts off and add a box that asks people to fund the website every month by bitcoin micro transactions or tips.
So say 10,000 users donate just £0.10, that's £1,000 in revenue with 0 adverts. 0 adverts obviously helping to improve user experience on the site because there are no distracting ads.
But what if you have a really dedicated userbase of 1000 people who would gladly pay just £1 per month for content. 
What are your thoughts?
I made a slightly longer post about using Bitcoin to fund online content here:
@_date: 2013-04-03 00:16:02
I believe bitcoin will change the way all online content will be funded, advertising free! Check out the thread I made about it:
@_date: 2013-03-19 18:58:52
Awesome :) Glad I was able to live up to my own hype :)
@_date: 2013-03-20 17:45:09
Ah yeah I remember people talking about copyright problems and gaming networks. Hopefully you'll be able to sort something out.
Good luck! And let me know how you get on in the future. I'm off out so have a good night.
@_date: 2013-03-20 16:59:59
I feel Bitcoin micro transactions will be the future of funding online content.
You currently have 621 subscribers. If every subscriber paid 10p per month for your content with bitcoins, you'd have £61. I'm sure you're not making £61 with advertising, and with bitcoin mirco tips you wouldn't have to have adverts.
Now imagine you have 10,000 subs or 50,000 subs.
Obviously this depends a lot of on the ease of being able to send bitcoin tips and consumer behaviour, but i'm willing to bet this will work.

I feel bitcoin tipping will be the future for funding online content (for some). Imagine a website that had 0 advertising, but just a box somewhere that gave the option for the reader to send a bitcoin tip. All it would take is for users to send a $0.10 tip per month. It sounds small but if enough people do it it all adds up.
It's something I plan to experiment with if my website takes off. However we do need to make it easier for people who don't have bitcoins to get it all set up.

I tipped a musician $0.50 the other day for his work. Took like 5 seconds. Check my history and you'll see the exchange. You'll also see i'm a strong believer in funding online content with bitcoin micro transactions.

Advertising has been the primary business model on the web for a long time but users have made it clear that they don’t want to see ads. Mozilla isn’t trying to directly disrupt the ad business but it is trying to fix serious privacy issues relating to ad networks. What if users explicitly paid for content instead? navigator.mozPay() enables this kind of direct payment model: if something is good on the web, you can pay for it. It already seems to be working well for existing mobile apps. Will mobile ads even generate the same revenue for content producers as they do on desktop? I don’t have answers to these questions but one thing is for certain: the web should support businesses of all kinds and payments should be a first class feature of the web.
As someone who is a strong believer in funding online content with micro transactions instead of advertisements, this paragraph is sooooo awesome! Go mozilla!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Ahh right I see. Thanks for the reply and good luck!

Yeah I agree. Check out this thread I made on it which is a bit longer:
I have faith that people are willing to pay very small amounts for their favourite content per month (we're talking 10p), especially if that content is ad free!

Hey G0rth, did you receive my bitcoin tip that I sent yesterday? I think I did something wrong in my command below.
@_date: 2013-03-23 12:52:12
Using cash scenarios to explain why bitcoin doesn't serve any value is an extremely bad example. Bitcoin's value mainly comes in the form of things like extremely low transaction fees.
Scenarios where bitcoin have value:
- Someone working in country A who wants to send money back to their family in country B
- Businesses who operate in countries that aren't supported by Visa / Paypal etc
- Being able to micro tip someone in a completely different country (I feel this is the future of funding online content)
- Businesses being able to offer lower prices to customers because they don't have to pay transaction fees etc
@_date: 2013-03-26 22:48:20
I'm a strong believer in funding online content through micro transactions via bitcoin. This isn't possible atm because in order for this to work, it needs to be extremely easy (as in one click) to send someone on the internet a bit coin tip. 
@_date: 2013-03-19 17:06:53
Really really sorry dude but having some trouble. I've received those bitcoin tips, but have no idea how to add them to the blockchain.info wallet that I created after receiving the tips. 
Are there any guides or tutorials that you could recommend?

Hey Bitcoinstore. Just to clarify, you guys are able to offer cheaper prices for products because of the costs you save by not paying transaction fees etc? Or is it something else.
If so, how much would you say the price drops purely from using bitcoins?
Are there any other benefits of buying physical products using bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-03-23 13:16:39
It certainly **will** be :)
@_date: 2013-03-19 12:48:40
Awesome! Going by your blog you seem to know a fair bit about bitcoin.
What are the downsides (if any) of online content creators receiving bitcoins, then every month exchanging them for alternative currencies (such as $ or £) in order to then use that money to pay for rent, bills, food etc?
Thinking about it, who would actually pay you alternative currency for bitcoins? The community? People looking to buy bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-03-19 19:21:01

As someone who loves the idea of funding online content via bitcoin micro transactions, I would have to say Youtube. Imagine if youtubers could choose to not display adverts, but instead receive bitcoins from users. Even a £0.10 bitcoin tip per month per user would result in much higher funds for the youtuber... with 0 advertising!

I'd use all of the BC to tip people on various sub reddits in order to help spread the word. Tipping someone $0.20 in a big thread can gain a lot of awareness of BC and help support the idea of micro transactions for online content.

Contract? One of these bastard gaming networks or something?
I have a website i'm working on atm and hopefully in the future I will have enough traffic to experiment with funding a website through bitcoin micro transactions. 
With youtube, it would be awesome if there was a button under the video that allowed people to select an amount and pay right there and then.
This ease of use is vital for this idea to work!
And no worries for the tip :)
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:47:30
Exactly. Classic example in my case, i've been watching the vlog brothers on youtube for ages now. Yet I use adblock because I hate adverts on youtube and can't turn it off for just them.
By being able to send micro transactions with bitcoin, i'm able to financially contribute to them for the first time in a way that makes sense. 
Also this articles explains why advertising is wrong for the internet:
