Not sure I understand how it's 'falsely pumping money...'? If I have 100 USDT and sell them for 100 USD, it's not new money? Or is it like they use 'new' USDT to buy stuff with?
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:12:13
OK. So the assumption is that these guys just create new USDT for themselves and use it to buy BTC or other cryptos on exchanges which support USDT?

We'll all be dead by then, 2140. But miners could still make money using transaction fees.


It's not 'really slow' to transfer. It's almost instant. But, depending on the fee on your transaction, it can take a couple of minutes to hours / days to validate. 
I guess your question is more like 'How can we use it as a day to day transaction system, you don't want anyone waiting 2 hours to get a confirmation after buying a coffee'. 
Well, the blockchain isn't made for the 'day to day' transactions (buying coffee, etc). If we get to the level of Visa, for example, most of the actual crypto currencies would have trouble to deal with it. That being said, there are other solutions being worked on to make these kind of transactions work better. There's mimblewimble and the lightning network. LN is a layer 2 protocol, so that it can be used to make a lot of transaction and just settle the 'summary' of all the transactions on the block chain. I don't know much about mimblewimble.  There's other solution that would affect the blockchain directly also that will make it more 'scalable'. 


You can send money to your family or friends on another continent for 5 cents instead of $50. Nobody can decide that they freeze your account. The merchants or the customers will pay much lower fees with their transactions VS what Visa and other CC charges. Think about that... you don't need a bank anymore. Imagine that banks are now useless. 
Also think about all the poorer people that can't have a bank account because they either don't have enough money and/or no paper identification. They don't need to have a bank anymore, they are their own bank.


Some people say that the terrorist will use that. Drug dealers, etc. Probably. But IMO they already use banks and cash to do their dirty business. Would that be worse? I honestly don't know. Maybe. That would also have the possibility to help people that live in countries where the government don't allow them to have bank accounts, or can just freeze their assets if they are 'against' the government, etc. 


A disadvantage VS what? I honestly think that a lot of people treat Bitcoin as an investment that is supposed to get them rich quickly. Bitcoin is an experiment. There are scalability problems. I think / hope they will get fixed and worked around. Will this happen? Nobody knows for sure. Maybe another crypto 10 times better than Bitcoin written by another Satoshi Nakamoto will emerge and will render Bitcoin obsolete... nobody knows. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:37:23
There's also other problems to solve before mass adoption:
* User friendliness. Getting / buying crypto is confusing and annoying. Getting your coins in a wallet... Calculating transaction fees. The mempool? 
* Security: It's easy to get hacked or simply send your stuff to a wrong address. And there's no insurances, so that needs to be addressed (in the sense that it needs to be hard to make that kind of error and easy to secure your coins).
* Volatility: A lot of merchants and people won't use it if the currency fluctuates 10% per day.
Do you think that if the transaction fees were really low at the moment, everybody would use bitcoins at its current state? In my opinion, we're at best 5 years before mass adoption and fixing the above problems. Yes, fees is probably slowing that down a little, but all the other points will take more time to fix.

So, if I understood correctly, he is saying that we would need a channel with every place you do business with. In my opinion, that's a bit of the extreme scenario, no? Saying that you will need only one channel is the other extreme though... I guess we'll start more towards that first scenario and then, eventually, it'll go more towards the second.
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:52:17
Fees aren't that bad honestly. I think it's just that most of the use cases don't let people choose the fees they want or user simply don't know they can change them. I wouldn't care to be able to change the fees on exchanges and receives the Bitcoins 1 week later. Most of the use cases for me on the blockchain at the moment are like that. And that's probably why I don't buy coffee with Bitcoins, which hopefully LN will solve. So I agree, I don't think it'll offload transactions on the blockchain that much, but it should help a bit.

I don't know about that online wallet, but on some hardware wallet you can set the amount you want to pay as a fee. So you can set a lower transaction fee if you're not in a hurry. 
You can also check the state of the mempool (what transaction still need to be validated) here 
It's pretty much bloated at the moment.
You can also get how much fees you have to pay VS how long you would have to wait here.
At the bottom, you can see a message like 




88k satoshis = $17
You can still pay only 61 sat/byte if you don't mind waiting 660 minutes (~11 hours). That would be about $2.
Another tip, get a hardware wallet on your phone (coinomi is easy to use and work on IPhone and Android), otherwise you don't own your 'private keys'.

A ponzi scheme works like this:
1. Someone says 'Invest in my fund, it returns 10% per year'
2. 10 people invest with $100 each
3. After a year, 1 of the investor wants to get his $110 out of the fund.
4. Since it's not a real fund, the investor is reimbursed with what money is left in the 'fund'. So 1000 - 110 = $890 left in the fund. Providing the fund 'manager' didn't use most of the money already on lambos. Or more like donuts at these kind of prices.
5. The fund 'manager' recruits other people, etc. Makes his fund up to 10 million of dollars! He uses a bit stack of that money to keep on with his donut eating habit lifestyle...
6. As long as there's enough money left in the fund to reimburse the people that want out, the scheme works and the fund 'manager' can keep using a good % of the money to buy donuts. He sends fake reports to the investors, they think they make good money on their investments, when really they are all donuts being digested.
7. At some point though, a lot of people wants out... More then what's left in the fund. That's when the fund 'manager' have trouble to reimburse everyone, keeps delaying transactions, eventually the FBID (federal bureau of investigation for donuts) will get involved, etc etc. 
Bitcoins works like this:
1. You can go on an exchange and buy from someone that sell his bitcoins.
2. You can also sell your bitcoin on an exchange for the price that you want.
3. You will get the money that someone is ready to pay for, which at the moment of writing is about 11k (let me know if you want to sell for like 9k.. I'll buy it thanks)
4. It's possible that you will lose all your money however, but not for the same reason as the ponzi scheme. It would be if Bitcoins loses his value. For example, imagine that a lot of big countries decide to make it illegal. Or if there's a major vulnerability found that makes the blockchain unusable, etc.
Bitcoin is not a ponzi scheme, it's a risky investment. Like Andreas Antonopoulos said (approximately), sure it makes the first people that invested in it rich if Bitcoin continues to grow and is successful. Is it fair? Maybe not. But will you bail me out if Bitcoin fails? Will you give everyone that invested their money back? 
Also, an investor that invested in the beginning and was intelligent/lucky enough to keep his bitcoin all the way through the dips of the past could still get screwed in the future. A 'new' investor of like a month ago could've made 50% on his 10 million investment, sell it now, and tomorrow Bitcoin could crash. He would have more money than the guy that had 100 Bitcoins and never sold those... Nobody is saying that Bitcoin will give you 10% or 50% on your investment. It could crash tomorrow.

So, let's say that all these 'tests pass' and let's say that the code is complete and can work etc, it's only the part to have a one on one channel? A can connect to B, but if B is connected to C, a can't 'talk' to C? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:54:42
Can't you use it to pay anything as long as they are part of the same network? You are connected to Bob, which in turn is connected to Amazon and Ebay. Can't you pay on Ebay and Amazon with just 1 channel? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:46:26
What kind of transaction? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:49:13


Or someone that does, or someone that connect to someone that does etc. The payments can have many 'hops' to one node, then another, then another, etc.. until it reaches its destination. 
You can open a channel with anyone. Let's say you 'block' $100 worth of Bitcoins when opening the channel, you can spend it anywhere as long as the other end is reachable throughout the network.
But, at the beginning, that'll probably be a bit harder to use (?). I think the first users will have to have many channels open or there will be some nodes that will be more centralized than others. We'll see. I'll certainly use it as soon as a company I use supports it, even if it means that I'll need to 'block' $100 just to do businesses with that company.
@_date: 2017-08-26 16:21:49
I was talking about open source in general. So one person or multiple people owns a code repository, and they add code to the repository. They can also accept (or reject) code from other people.
So, most open source is made from people working on it for free, because they like it, it's a side project for fun, it makes them learn new stuff, etc.
Programmers working on the bitcoin core aren't paid by a company to do so (afaik), they do that during their free time.


Since Bitcoin is an open source project, anyone can just copy the code and modify it like they want (aka fork it). So let's say I create Bitcoin2, if it's super great and addresses all of bitcoin's problems etc.. maybe it'll be adopted by miners, exchanges, etc etc. 
If there's an evil company with billions of dollars that wants to create a new alt coin (by copying bitcoin) that would help them achieve their evil agenda, nothing can prevent that either. If they have a lot of money to push people to adopt their new coin (exchanges, miners, nodes, etc etc), it could 'work' who knows...
For LN, I'm not sure about the group that develops it, but I believe it's not in bitcoin's core, so they are different developers. Will it be included in Bitcoin's core by the developers that have repository access or will it have to be an addition that people running bitcoin core will also need to install to support LN, I don't know. 
If it's number 1, the people that have access to Bitcoin core's code repository will accept or reject LN code. 
If it's option 2, it'll have to make sense to most of the people for them to install and support it. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:42:25
In my opinion it makes more  sense, since the end user can understand somehow that they're downloading something and it takes space. My mom understand that if she downloads a movie, it takes space and she needs to pay for it. She understands that if she download an image, it's smaller than a movie. 
No way she's going to understand how paying per byte of transaction makes sense. I don't even understand how this works at the moment and why it fluctuates and I work in IT.
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:44:41
That's how open source mostly works, yes. Sure there could be some monetary advantages in the long term just because they know the technology, but they would make more from their time working in a standard company.

Your wallet is 'plugged' on the BTC network, After the split, when the B2X network is created with the copied ledger, you'll need a wallet that also can point to the B2X network and where you can initialize the wallet with your addresses (since it's a copy of the ledger, they will be the same as your wallet pointing to the BTC network).
I'm summary, You will have to wait for a wallet that supports B2X cpins and instructions on how to import your current keys. As long as you have your BTC addresses, you will be able to retrieve your B2xX addresses since they will copy the ledger.

@_date: 2017-11-06 16:20:08
Here's my 'ELIGR':
You have a ledger like:
* You gave Rex 2 cookies
* Rex gave Snowball 1 cookie
Bad dog copy ledger and try to take over saying his ledger and his rules are the real way to do it.
Some pack of dogs say that Bad dog is right and new way to track cookies is Bad dog's way. 
They say they will start to use Bad dog's ledger and rules for the cookie transactions following the split.
Other dogs say that Bad dog doesn't know what he's barking about and will stick with the original ledger and rules on how the cookies are sent to other doggos.
After the split, depending on who you bark with, you will either use Bad dog's ledger and rules or the legacy ledger and rules. 
If you had 1 cookie before the split, you will now have 1 cookie in the legacy ledger and 1 cookie in the new ledger, since it's a copy of the transactions, not a copy of the physical cookies. 
Some group of dogs may let you use both of the versions of the ledger when you want cookies, letting you know that you're using Bad dog's ledger or the legacy ledger. 
Some will try to trick you saying you are cookiing on the 'bitcoin ledger' while you are in fact using Bad dog's ledger and rules.
Bad dog is kinda trying to take over the ledger and rules to, probably, change rules after the split to get more cookies for him and his friends.
Edit: more barks and woofs

@_date: 2017-11-06 14:57:32
Yes and .. no. But having only your words is safe. The words are used to generate the keys. It's handy, because let's say you have wallet A and wallet B implement the support for B2X first, you can import your keys in wallet B using your word list and use your B2X coins there. You could also take one by one the private keys from wallet A (if the wallet can show you the private keys) and import them one by one to wallet B. What the word list is doing is effectively making the generation of keys easier, one after the other.
Let's say the words list 'elephant giraffe baby leaf' put in a specific algorithm gives the private address  then your next private address will be   etc. That's how, when put into a wallet, these word lists can retrieve find all of your private addresses, VS having to copy all the private addresses by hand.
Note that the private addresses aren't really a number but more of a random string of characters which can also be represented by a QR code. And it's not 100% 'exactly' how the sequential addresses are generated, but I think it's a good ELI5 :P
Edit: You have multiple private/public addresses when you use a wallet because wallets use a new address each time you receive bitcoin, VS using the same address over and over. I'm not entirely sure why, but I think it's for security and also to use less transaction place, so the future transaction costs would be smaller from an address that got only 1 transaction.
Usually there should be a tutorial at some point after the fork on 'How to import B2X with ABC wallet', just Google that eventually and you should find one. Just be sure to check if it's safe to spend your coins on the 2 different chains before, because of the 'no replay protection' thing. In summary, I would personally wait 1 week or 2 to see how it goes. 
If you want to sell your B2X after some time after the split and you can't find a tutorial, ask here: 'How can I sell my B2X using ABC wallet?'

So what is your proposition? To completely ban posts about BCH? Honestly I don't care either way, but I'm not sure why you posted that comment.
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:53:34
I'll try:
You're using bitcoin that uses a specific software and a ledger. Someone copied that software + ledger, made a minor modification, and now claims is better than the 'legacy bitcoin', but it is mostly the same. The difference is that these people now control the repository code (the one they copied), so they would control the future changes to bitcoin if that becomes the 'official' legder/software'.
When they enable their new coin, you will now have like 2 copies of bitcoin running in parralel... 2 ledger, 2 version of the software (some servers will use the 'legacy' bitcoin, other have already installed that 'new' b2x bitcoin. So if you own 10 BTC before the 'split/fork' happens, you will own 10 btc on both versions of bitcoin, since the ledger is copied over too.
If you send me 1 btc on chain  I can go on the second chain and re-execute the same transaction, so you will also send me 1 btc there. Unless the new chain implement 'replay protection', which they said they won't.
At the moment, exchanges list the original chain as BTC. After the split, some say that they will list the new chain as B2X, but others said they will list the new chain as BTC and forget about the 'legacy' chain, depending on different criteria. Some said they will list as BTC the chain that has the more miners on it. Which can get confusing.. Imagine thinking you're buying the 'original' bitcoin, but in fact buying another coin (b2x). So it's possible that on some exchanges, you would buy BTC coins listed as BTC, and on others you would buy B2X coins listed as BTC.
Basically, people say that they are creating that new 'bitcoin' to be able to control the code repository and not having to deal with the developers currently working on the 'original bitcoin'  code at the moment. People are also saying that it's mostly companies behind this new 'fork' and that they are doing it for their own interest, since if their new coin takes the place of the 'legacy bitcoin coin', they would indeed control the code repository. They could indeed change the software in question, for example they could implement some ways for miners to make more money, like preventing off chain cheaper versions of ways to make transactions (the lightning network for example), change the hash rules (give more money to miners somehow), change the fees rules, etc. 
By the way a fork is the action of copying a code repository and starting a new one with it (at least in that case). I could copy the bitcoin core code and start a new coin called 'super extra bitcoin' in 10 minutes, but I would need people to spawn nodes with it, create a network, have the exchanges to acknowledge my new coin and list it, etc etc. 
Edit: Precisions, grammar, etc

Investing in bitcoin is pretty risky, but since you're young, and depending on your risk tolerance, it could be a good 'gamble' to have some bitcoins. 
And no, you don't have to have a whole coin, you can have up to 100 millions of a coin IIRC. So, basically, if you have $121.34 to invest in bitcoin, you can invest $121.34. 
You should probably also check stuff like ETFs, the stock market, bounds... read on different investment strategies / theories and pick the one  you like the best.
