Hello, great initiative mate.
I'm unemployed for several months and find it difficult to meet ends and cover expenses. I'm strong supporter of BTC  in the past year. I do have very small portion bitcoin. I would appreciate if you decide to help me out, thanks for your consideration! 33nri3BbYQmA3HgStQLtnJsCGbYz7Srjy2

Good deed pal!

Thumbs up if you are against the CEX monopoly, we should be in possession of our own funds! NVO for the WIN!
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:47:27
The first thing to do/test is checking the BTC price! :D
@_date: 2017-12-01 08:32:16
What if you are not alive by then?
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:26:00
Just HODL and believe, bitcoin foundation will get us there :)
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:16:49
And this is only the beginning, 10k here we come, hold your horses!
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:19:53
Very sad, exchanges control your funds. If you want to avoid this, check NVO - the best dex that is going to change the crypto world. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:51:34
Do you think there is still hope?
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:38:01
I'm not there yet. However, it helped me while i'm looking for new career opportunities.

It's safe to say that the grand scheme to overtake btc has failed, pump and dump over. Cheers Roger Ver
@_date: 2018-03-09 10:35:24
I second this.
@_date: 2017-09-08 08:49:33
You can start a business and invest the money from bitcoin then retire. I can give you some ideas, you can pm me
@_date: 2017-09-08 08:38:07
HaydanTruax, sounds cool bro. You can help a brother and donate me 1 BTC if you wish :)
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:19:45
Thank you Satoshi. You made the planet a better place, Bitcoin is power, bitcoin is freedom, it abolishes slavery from financial institutions. Cheers!

Noo, i got goxxed again. I thought there would be a fierce hunting.
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:20:43
Depends on your point of view. But in general, shaky hands will be out of the game which is good for the long run.
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:58:34
Now the FUD is over, you can start buying back Bitcoin till we reach the moon!
@_date: 2018-04-17 11:03:56
I had issues with them, my  were ETH stuck last year. I got them back with a lot of persistence. Never used their exchange again. They were having lots of issues almost with every crypto pair. It seems things haven't changed much. Just stay away from HITBTC and you'll be fine.
@_date: 2017-07-16 15:53:49
I had ticket for 2 months for upgrading my limit more than 2000$ which is a joke. They sent me an email that they haven't heared from me and closed the ticket. I'll never go back there, no support at all, many bugs and super insecure exchange.
@_date: 2017-07-21 11:06:42
You're right, but I want to buy at dip, if it hits 2k 2.3k it would be great. I don't want to buy now and the to see the price plummet.
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:28:21
Guys look into NVO - decentralized exhange. Such fraunds and huge losses won't be possible if you don't  rely on third party
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:17:27
Huge risk holding big amounts in exchanges. NVO is the future - decentralized exchange.

What does it happens when lock in occurs? Pls explain
@_date: 2017-07-21 09:26:48
Guys i have some questions. Will the price go up or down in the next few days, what are the odds? Is it safe to buy btc and trade before after 1 August?
@_date: 2017-07-21 09:45:50
The things is, do you think the price will drop dramatically this weekend as well? August 1 is approaching
