Then buy ripple if that's what your gut tells you to do. Just make sure you've done thorough research.

I hope everyone is taking this seriously. do a little digging regarding the coordination of Bcash coinable release w/ BTC retarget, dumps of big players BTC, and massive FUD campaign and it begins to become obvious whats going on. Even as just an isolated incident, however it's not. Same thing happened during the BTC retarget a month ago when BCH last pumped, except the coinable launch was not a factor in that one. BCH is fraudulent. Rich people playing games with poor people's money.

With enough money any of the top coins can be gamed. Just a matter of motives. Wild west out here. This is the free market x massive wealth inequality in action.

Let it be known. First took notice during the mid- November retarget. Yesterday made me sick watching it all unfold.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:32:57
And why is that?
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:39:28
Go to another exchange and tell others to do the same.

You are new. Get to googling my friend.

Don't get nasty. He/she is absolutely right. However the original dream/iteration was a people's currency. Coinbase=banksters in the unregulated people's currency realm. Banksters up to their usual bullshit.

They're not doing it to halt Bitcoin, they're doing it to stop shitcoin cash from plummeting. Which also stops the btc rallies unfortunately, sell orders stacking like a marathon Jenga game while they were allowing orders only. So they halted orders. Did the same shit yesterday. I suspect coinbase doesn't have the liquidity to cover all the sell orders after the last couple days. Call it a hunch, call it a measured observation, call it whatever you like. One thing is for sure: coinbase is fucked. I pulled all my holdings out, I'd recommend you all do the same.

With the slow drip in miner return, hopefully the next 12 hours will will be better.

Carry on then!

Excellent news. I'll go to sleep when the unconfirmed transaction count loses that pesky 6th digit.
