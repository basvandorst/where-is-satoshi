This is called a run on the bank. There is nothing logical about human fear.

Two valid chains will emerge and individuals will own Bitcoin on both chains.  They can choose whatever they want to do with that Bitcoin, sell it or keep it, on either or both of those chains.
The result could be a non-issue, as in Monero which undergoes a HF every 6 months where 99% of the miners immediately switch to the upgraded software.  Or it could result in two coexisting cryptocurrencies that share a common history like Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.  Most miners chose to HF to Ethereum (Ethereum Classic is actually the non-HF version) although about 5% are still mining the original chain.

For me, the biggest detractor to Bitcoin is its network. Miners are too few, too centralized, and are ignoring the needs of its users.

Two modes of thought that become possible for humans as they develop through their lifetimes are 1) build up a set of internal filters to apply onto observable reality in order to make that reality conform to their established internal perspective or 2) reduce one's internal filters to attempt to see reality without judgment in its most immediate and observable form.  I only have interest in reality - direct observable reality (option 2).
It appears that you are fixated on Option 1 - building up filters that stand between the reality outside of yourself and your internal experiences.  The universe is breathtaking in its beauty and I hope that you have an opportunity to experience it - to step out from behind the filters, remove judgment, and simply be.

Bitcoin Unlimited is an altcoin because they do not implement Segwit. Litecoin is not an altcoin if they adopt Segwit.
You know, first getting into Bitcoin I thought I was interested in cryptocurrency, but now I realize I was just interested in the partitioning of information within a block. This is what makes Bitcoin, Bitcoin, and all else an alt.
Long live Segwit! It's bigger than Bitcoin.

They just need to learn the rules of this subreddit: an altcoin that uses segwit is not an altcoin; and any Bitcoin implementation that does not include segwit is an altcoin and therefore irrelevant to this subreddit.

Bitcoin is expensive and slow as fuck compared to altcoins. The doors out of this hellscape are all around and guess what? I and many others are taking them. Where will this leave you when you want to interact on the global p2p cash network? Because you certainly won't be getting access using the Bitcoin protocol.

You seem to have forgotten an "/s" at the end of your comment. Both those milestones were passed by alts long ago.
