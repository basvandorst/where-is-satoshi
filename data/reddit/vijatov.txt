No I mean if Satoshi deleted the blockchain. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 17:03:09
Perfect 
@_date: 2018-09-03 20:53:49
I was talking about the concept of ego, not yourself mate, I enjoy this discussion. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:06:45
So you’re saying one persons time is not equal to anothers? 
@_date: 2018-09-03 02:22:43
Sounds ideal. Far from the oceans too
@_date: 2018-09-06 18:57:37
That my friend, is the right question. ��
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:35:28
Thing is about bitcoin, once everyone buys it, maybe let’s say the price goes to 100k who knows. If you had 1,000,024 bitcoin, that’d be quite a lot of moolah. But all those innocent people invested all their money when you delete the blockchain what would they do? 
@_date: 2018-09-02 02:56:46
Where would
You choose?
@_date: 2018-09-02 03:12:46
There’s tons of sites out there like this already friend.
@_date: 2018-09-02 02:58:55
I’m with you on this one. 
@_date: 2018-09-02 02:56:05
What if satoshi came back and popped the bubble on everyone? 
@_date: 2018-09-07 17:01:12
I take it you haven’t been to prison? 
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:39:49
But we’re going to be on mars soon as there’s tons of gold there so? 
@_date: 2018-09-02 03:15:36
I hope you run this off renewables 
@_date: 2018-09-03 02:21:31
What exactly is value? 
@_date: 2018-09-07 17:03:34
Best of luck on your future endeavours. 
@_date: 2018-09-02 20:54:29
What is gold worth?
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:41:01
Why would someone pay $1000 for some gold if it took them 100 hours to accumulate at work. What you gonna do with it? 
@_date: 2018-09-05 23:40:16
Thats what I meant exactly ����
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:14:48
What stops the 1% controlling all the gold? 
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:16:04
If Satoshi dropped the bomb on capitalism I promise you nothing would be the same afterwards.
@_date: 2018-09-02 03:14:45
@_date: 2018-09-06 19:39:37
Maybe one day haha ����‍♂️ just playing my friend. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:15:14
They could literally buy all the gold in the world and have a monopoly on everything. They already own all the keys 
@_date: 2018-09-05 23:39:19
True, it’s all forks now baby.
@_date: 2018-09-02 02:58:14
What gives gold value?
@_date: 2018-09-03 20:54:30
None 
@_date: 2018-09-02 20:54:48
Why use currency 
@_date: 2018-09-02 03:14:28
What’s your wallet address I’ll send you some
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:36:40
Would that be bigger than the financial crash of 2008?
@_date: 2018-09-03 02:21:43
How come? 
@_date: 2018-09-03 20:54:42
Nothing has ‘value’ 
@_date: 2018-09-02 20:53:18
Better and more readily available metals than gold my friend 
@_date: 2018-09-02 03:10:58
Please don’t name your kids after bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-09-02 02:57:54
Why even go back to gold 
@_date: 2018-09-08 08:10:35
I don’t want to use cigarettes, I believe bitcoin is ready to take on the world 
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:36:51
It’s everywhere now. 
@_date: 2018-09-02 02:57:14
Sounds good 
@_date: 2018-09-07 17:02:46
What then?
@_date: 2018-09-03 02:17:22
How is that different from bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-09-03 02:17:52
We were getting away from physical money and now people want it back???
@_date: 2018-09-02 03:13:29
Agreed ��
@_date: 2018-09-02 20:52:21
I’m with you on that, people need to stop looking at the £$¥€ price, it was never about that. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:44:43
But wouldn’t everyone just start mining gold again? Pillaging whatever natural beauty is left on this earth? 
@_date: 2018-09-02 03:16:52
Come on guys cryptocurrencies are great. It’s like cash, but not cash.
@_date: 2018-09-07 17:01:37
Why do you need electricity, sorry maybe that’s a stupid question. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 02:22:14
You give someone your time in exchange for theirs, seems really good. 1:1
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:45:05
Or buy the gold up 
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:37:28
Perfect way to get people to understand ‘trust’
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:35:55
If bitcoin disappeared overnight, let’s say 
@_date: 2018-09-03 02:23:04
What’s stopping you? Need some bitcoin to get you going? 
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:10:03
Ah, ego there we go.
@_date: 2018-09-02 03:18:01
I predict it will cost $1.
@_date: 2018-09-02 20:54:58
Time sounds like a much better currency 
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:44:57
I’ll sell shovels
