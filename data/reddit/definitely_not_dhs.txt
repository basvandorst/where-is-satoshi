You know what your biggest risk is? Not law enforcement.
Your biggest risk, as a typical nerdy Bitcoiner, is getting robbed.
Don't sell on LBC for cash unless it's absolutely necessary. The scumbags come out of the woodwork.
LBC is compromised by law enforcement anyway. Like, really really compromised. A den of law enforcement officers looking to make cases because their higher-ups need to meet a 'bitcoin case' quota? Plus a den of increasingly ghetto losers looking to "hit a lick" from some nerdy computer nerd?
Stay home and use Gemini. Save yourself the trouble.

I am speaking of the FEDERAL system.
Have you ever been a defendant in a federal criminal matter? I may, or may not have been, in an alleged previous life.

It's not a precedent setting case. There are multiple cases now that are very similar in nature in the United States.

Sorry. I don't Reddit much. My apologies.

You're right, I'm not Charlie Shrem.
Although I remember when Charlie was arrested and started making public comments regarding his case. I vaguely recall Charlie publicly acknowledging in an interview something along the lines of, "Yeah...our buyers on Silk Road are good customers". Something along those lines. Obviously not an exact quote.
I literally remember pasting a link of that interview with Charlie to a friend in a text message and said, "Yep, he's fucked. 36-48 months, easy"
When you're 24 years old, you know it all. Until you realize you don't.
I like Charlie though. We all do dumb shit when we're young. (Not that BitInstant was dumb shit. But talking publicly about your case and self-incrimination definitely is.)

There is a ton of inaccurate information being thrown around here. 
If you are reading this Mr. Rockcoons, I want you to take away one thing from reading this: STOP talking about your case publicly. Retain an attorney. Get off Reddit, get off social media. I know you're anxious as fuck right now. **I know this because I have been in your shoes.** You are a criminal defendant now. Smart criminal defendants don't talk to the police...and they don't speak publicly about their case. In fact, they don't talk to ANYONE about their case other than their defense attorney. **Be smart.**
Now, onto the specifics.
A lot of people in this community have parrot syndrome. That is, they hear someone say something, and they just repeat it as fact. When it comes to the legality of something, it can be a dangerous thing to listen to the parrots.
For example, there is no law that says you can trade Bitcoin as long as it is under $10,000. This is false. This $10,000 threshold being discussed is a misinterpretation of the law by Reddit lawyers. The $10,000 rule applies to banks and MSBs (Money Services Businesses) that handle more than $10,000 in cash from one customer, per business day. If you are a bank or money transmitter and handle more than this much cash per day from one customer, you are required to fill our an IRS CTR (Cash Transaction Record) and retain it for a period of 5 years. 
If you are merely a Bitcoiner that has $10,000 worth of Bitcoin to sell and are not selling Bitcoin "as a business", there is no requirement to even register as a MSB or fill out and retain a CTR. 
So the question becomes, is what you are doing by trading Bitcoin constitute money transmission under both State and Federal laws? (If you violate a state money transmission law, you are in also in violation of federal law. It is a federal offense to violate a state money transmission law.)
Let's take a look at Mr. Rockcoons now PUBLIC admissions.
1.) He has now publicly (and I would imagine privately with the DHS interview he mentioned) admitted to operating a Money Services Business. Not only has he admitted to this offense, there is proof that he operated an unregistered MSB according to his voluminous LocalBitcoins history. 
If you have 100s or 1000s of LBC sales, are accepting cash in the mail as payment for Bitcoin and have publicly (and while under Law Enforcement interview) admitted to running a money transmission business...well then, you have a major problem if you're not registered with FinCEN as a money transmitter. (Plus licensed in the State of California is their state laws require licensure. Remember, if you violate a state money transmission law, you can be charged criminally on the federal level as well.)
2.) The government is claiming that Mr. Rockcoons knew that the USD he received in the mail were proceeds from selling hash oil. This is where the money laundering statute comes into play. The government has a problem here. That problem is referred to as "mens rea". See 
Mr Rockcoons agreed to this Bitcoin for cash trade. According to his statements, he communicated with the "buyer" solely by SMS and other electronic means. The government has a problem here if those texts reveal no knowledge on Mr. Rockcoons part regarding any hash oil proceeds. (Texts are saved by the wireless provider and can be subpoenaed) 
But what do I think, honestly? I think Mr. Rockcoons is leaving out a key component of this case. I believe Mr. Rockcoons made some sort of acknowledgment, whether directly or indirectly, that he was aware the proceeds the "buyer" was giving him were the result of selling hash oil. It could have been something as innocuous as follows to satisfy the mens rea:
Undercover: I am going to buy some equipment for my thc vape pen business with these coins. 
Mr. Rockcoons: Cool...I love to vape.
Undercover: Me too. I love weed.
Mr. Rockcoons: &lt;sends BTC&gt;
**THAT IS IT. THAT IS ALL IT TAKES TO SATISFY THE MENS REA TO CHARGE YOU WITH MONEY LAUNDERING.** Welcome to America.
Mr. Rockcoons, if you're reading this...and I hope you are...you gotta be smart here. You need to stop making public statements. You need to stop agreeing to speak to the police. (Although it's a bit late for both of these things) You need to get a lawyer that understands money transmission and cases involving technology.
I'm not sure you're ready for the truth, because neither was I when I was in your shoes. But here's the truth...and it sucks:
You're going to spend about 6 months - 18 months in a federal prison. Go download the Federal Sentencing Guidelines manual and look up the guidelines under the section for financial crimes. Then look at the table. (Yes, judges can depart from the guidelines...but they rarely do.) 90%+ of federal cases wind up with the accused going to jail. This is the federal system. Not many people just get probation in the federal system. As the expression goes, "The Feds could indict a ham sandwich."
Hash oil. Motherfucking hash oil. Not heroin, not bomb making equipment...the oil derived from a plant that nearly every fucking politician in the US has personally smoked...and they want to throw you in jail for it because some shitbag law enforcement officer threw it into a conversation to entrap you to make his case. If I were you I'd be furious too...and justifiably so. But then I'd have to ask myself, why me? Why was **I** the one on their radar? Mr Rockcoons, ask yourself this question: Have you been involved in anything *extracurricular* that could have put you on DHS's radar?
FOR GOD SAKES DON'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION PUBLICLY!
Again, GET A LAWYER AND STOP TALKING.
Mr. Rockcoons: DO NOT PAY FOR A PRIVATE LAWYER. Get a court-appointed attorney. In the federal system, the attorneys the court appoints are actually very decent. Paid lawyers that do federal criminal work **are fucking vultures**. They talk a big game and charge HUGE amounts of money to their clients despite the fact that they know 90% of the time they are going to just have their client plead guilty.
When the judge asks you if you can afford an attorney, you tell the truth. You cannot afford an attorney because the prosecution refuses to release your mobile phone where your digital assets are stored. The court will have you sign a document affirming that you are indigent, and you will be appointed an attorney.
Tone Vays: You are seriously a dick for letting this kid ramble on your interview and incriminate the FUCK out of himself. All so you can get views? Amazing.

The problem is simple:
The cash for Bitcoin market in the United States is largely comprised of people doing something illegal. No, not everyone that buys BTC for cash is a criminal. But yes, it is a solid 40%+, conservatively.
I am only speaking of the PHYSICAL CASH for BTC trades...not BTC in general. A lot of people trading in person for cash are into some dirt. Law enforcement knows this.
So YOU may be an "upstanding citizen" (whatever that means), but the people you are associating with could be *less than* upstanding citizens.
Those less than upstanding folks will be what brings law enforcements attention your way.

I am absolutely not suggesting this Rockcoons guy deserves to go to jail. Nothing could be further from the truth.
Please re-read what I wrote.
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:42:06
He is definitely a lot of talk...no doubt.
But despite this, he doesn't deserve to go to jail. At least not for the alleged conduct.
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:41:08
The amount of self-incrimination in his interview with Tone Vays is motherfucking face-palming.
