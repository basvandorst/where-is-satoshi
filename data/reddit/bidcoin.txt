She looks a little bit retarded in this picture doesn't she? Or is she hardcore stoned?

Yes it's boring and it should be boring. It's just a payment system/money nothing to be fancy about. If you want gambling entertainment invest in pennystocks or play roulette.

The 20GB may be just the database not the id images which don't get shared (hopefully).

Because the crisis strategy doc was confirmed to be legit by karpeles? He may not giving sources but he got some. So this makes it news.

The Bitcoin network is based on the blockchain. Not just sending messages. If it would be possible to send money as emails you would have to buy emails first - or do you want to create the money out of thin air? Can't see your point.

Don't give any pictures or details of documents to anyone before you learned how bitcoin works. I don't want to raise your hopes but if your husband was into bitcoin for the last couple of years he may have a HUGE amount of money. Don't trust _anyone_ with this.

But he's a public person. He invented Bitcoin after all?

still, why would they sell and not continue to use them?

If you would reboot bitcoin almost the same distribution would happen again. People with money and the most mining equipment would get the largest chunk. That's called capitalism and it's everywhere not just in bitcoin. Same goes for stocks etc.
**My point is Simple; there is an inherent natural ceiling on BTC price and adoption, because if it ever gains a position of immense popularity, the barriers to entry will be extreme**
You only think about speculative investment. For most people it won't matter because bitcoin is bound to the USD. 50$ will be 50$ in bitcoin to buy stuff with regardless if 1 bitcoin is worth 100k USD. Yeah you are too late for easy money but that goes for thousands of exploded pennystocks too.

Because they sell the rigs for more money than it will ever be able to mine (at current prices).

E-Mails don't need a blockchain. Good luck with a free destributed p2p money network. Doesn't work.

For efficient transfer everyone has to be in the same cryptocurrency network. Just because something can be recreated doesn't mean it is less valueable. That's why facebook is worth a shit ton and one million other  clones with even better layout are worth nothing.
