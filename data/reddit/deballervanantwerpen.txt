Hey Goldbergger, I added a  for you
"Just like most people here now, I believe $7500-$8000 is coming soon. All signs pointing to it.
1) Death Cross coming soon
2) Not enough volume
3) Weekend sell off - people cashing out.
4) Japan FUD still has residual selling
5) Anytime some FUD like above happens, other governments or institutions usually jump in trying to bring the price down even further in attempts to take down bitcoin, although they fail to do that, it would affect the price to go down much more.
6) Still below 200 day and not able to cross above 9000 with multiple tries
7) Downtrend still hasn't finished.
8) Just look at the 1 hour candle chart on GDAX. It showed a brief reversal momentum, but now continues downward again. Even the 6 hour and day candles show the same, at least for short term.
9) Many other reasons.
10) 3 hours later I will look like a complete moron

I sincerely think Reddit should allow an IQ test for new people joining here.
The level of retardness is just too much to take
