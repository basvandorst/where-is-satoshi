i just checked using lm-sensors, here are the results :
Core 0:       +39.0°C  (high = +90.0°C, crit = +90.0°C)
Core 1:       +49.0°C  (high = +90.0°C, crit = +90.0°C)
Core 2:       +39.0°C  (high = +90.0°C, crit = +90.0°C)
Core 3:       +39.0°C  (high = +90.0°C, crit = +90.0°C)

to be honest, i setup this node after seing your post:-) You gave me the idea of mini PC. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-02-10 16:13:51
Nice setup!
@_date: 2017-02-10 12:26:58
no data cap (Europe), 100 Mbit/s, no lag for other devices.
@_date: 2017-02-10 16:17:28
ok good to know, they are probably cheap.
I like the mini PC for its nice design, it fits everywhere.

By running a node, you sustain the bitcoin netowkr and help the decentralization. You do not gain any profit but you can be proud of supporting a network in which you believe.

Yes, i measured it, its ranging from 10 to 13W with bitcoin core running.
@_date: 2017-02-10 12:25:40
Ubuntu 16.04. You can install the Bitcoin software using the PPA and the software center, it takes about 10 minutes to setup. Blockchain synced pretty fast. Then just open port 8333 in your router.

For now, around 14gb have been uploaded in 8 hours, i think around 30gb a day, so maybe around 1tb a month.

I used a Raspberry Pi 2 in the past as a full node but number of connections with other peers and amount of data shared was not as high as this mini PC. I had the feeling the RPI was running out of RAM pretty fast.
@_date: 2017-02-10 12:23:47
it's exactly this one. I ordered it without RAM or SSD and used some leftovers. 8gb RAM recommended.
@_date: 2017-02-10 16:16:07
when touching the case, it's middly hot, so i think cpu temp is at a healty level:-)
@_date: 2017-02-10 14:53:06
great advice. Purse is unfortunately not available in my country.
@_date: 2017-02-10 14:53:30
of course:-)
@_date: 2017-02-10 14:54:16
it is, you should do the same:-) It brings a lot of fun to have this setup at home.
@_date: 2017-03-04 10:22:12
Congrats OP! I also recently posted my full node setup here 
Almost 100 connected peers, around 1.5TB upload per month.
Everybody should run a node, it's such a great feeling to know that you are contributing to the network. Also, it's pretty satisfying for non-tech people like me to be able to setup a node. You will be proud looking at your low power PC or Raspberry working 24/24.

it's an old macbook pro 2011 HDD. It's really quiet, almost impossible to hear. As mentionned below, an SSD would be perfectly silent.

logo on both sides, worldwide shipping for 5$, 2 cups option also available!

GreenAddress enables Segwit on iOS

Same here! Probably same Aliexpress seller!
I made a post on Reddit a few months ago : 
Mini PC has been purchased here, quad core processor (N3150). I installed my old hard drive and 8gb ram.
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:44:45
Working smoothly, 24/24, absolutely stable. Not hot at all, very silent. To be 100% silent i would recommend an SSD even tough a regular HDD is doing the job perfectly.

Running a vps without GUI on core since years, can someone let me know the command line to run bitcoin UASF?
