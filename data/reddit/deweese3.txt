only play with money you can lose, in my case I can lose it but its gonna hurt :)

true that, thats why I spread it around. I own a few thousand of the top ten right now, plus more in BTC. But seriously everyone is pretty much guaranteed to go up 100% within the year the way this market is.

Buy the dip! Man I wish I did not drop 5k on BTC yesterday, would have gotten a lot more today.... Look its at 7% correction, and if Thursday on is any indication then it should go down 20% and slowly rise again. HODL! Most experts put BTC hitting 100k within the next 2 years, buy the dip!

Bro I sold 1000 bitcoins for around $1000 usd back in the day. I printed off the transaction and have it on my desk framed to show my biggest mistake.

I would follow the same rule I follow now. Split your money up 30% to stocks/401k, 30% to crypto, 30% savings and gold/silver. Gold and silver may save you if everything goes to shit, having a few thousand in gold and silver coins is never a bad idea, and it will never lose value.

Buy stocks with your 401k, and btc and crypto with your savings. Thats what I have done, when I sold my house over a year ago I cashed out all my stocks I had and btc and bought a very nice 40 acre ranch in CO. A million dollar home. Now I have a new strategy which is just using my 401k and all my free cash into BTC and the top ten crypto. Stocks are good, but I would rather invest some money in gold bars, and silver coins. If shit ever hit the fan you have currency to trade, very valuable.

Learn from me, I sold 1000 bitcoin for a little over 1000 bucks years back. Now I have like 1.5 bitcoin. I sold more btc when it reached $500 and thought it was too expensive now and that it would fall.... I have learned a lot.
@_date: 2019-07-31 14:03:11
I have thought about this as well and decided against it. Rather just buy $100 worth of btc every friday.

I sold 7 btc last year for 1k. Made profit, but learned a lot. HODL is my mantra now.

this is great news to wake up too!
@_date: 2019-06-24 18:03:00
same, I sold a bunch to purchase a house a year back. Had I held on I would have a lot of $$ right now. In the end though I still got a house and am thankful.

We are looking good boys and girls! Finally back in black, hodling and ignoring crypto for 9 months has paid off, I did not make any rash moves and now its looking good. I should have bought the dip but I am going to start just purchasing a little coin every week. I saw an article that if you had put $1 towards btc every day over the last 5 years you would be up a lot of money. Day trading never worked for me, but hodling did. Just gotta stop not investing, keep putting a little in it every chance you get.
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:49:50
its almost there!
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:48:04
oh a pullback is coming, no doubt. But seeing these highs brings me back to when we hit 20k, its starting to look like the ppl have stoped their emotional investing as much and we have made some progress. The overall market cap is still down compared to where it was, we are going to get there and go beyond.

Found localbitcoin website, thanks!
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:00:43
its the truth, been hodling since 2017.
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:29:47
just keep investing, dont try and time shit. Put a little in every week, and watch it grow. Hodl, dont day trade and it goes up and down a lot. Eventually you will be going up and down thousands per day, its normal. I was at 16k 4 days ago, now at 22k. This is normal, when you have done it for years you get used to it.
