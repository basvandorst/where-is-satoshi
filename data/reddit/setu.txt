That's right. I did not think about. I am visiting India now and they will start selling Firefix OS phone in 2299 Rupees which is less then 40 us$.
Also many people does not have bank accounts, but they have mobile phones. Thus is a great news.

1. create Mt.Gox account with photo id (address proof does not need. no need to be verified).
2. domestic bank transfer to Mt.Gox's Japanese bank account with your Mt.Gox ID number.
cost: normal domestic transfer fee depending on your bank and amount. 0 or 200 to 450 jpy.
3. Buy BTC as you know, by JPY.

I was worried about crash in last 5 days, but if you watch the market in daily value, all the crash and recovery disappeared as if nothing has happened :) 
I feel our bitcioin market became strong. It recovered within a day, and you can not see it in this daily chart....
It's great.

Yes, Bitcoin is like a pricious metal then currency. I would like to define Bit coin as the virtual precious metal. And we can use precious metal as a currency like gold or silver. 
Precious metal does not loose value by cutting in pieces. 
No organization guarantee the value of the precious metals. The atom of the precious metal itself is very rare, and it is the value of the precious metals.
Because the precious metals are property of the atom, it is not possible to create it by chemical reaction. 
So, it is very much natural to think Bitcoin as the virtual pricious metal. And because it exists only in the network, in the cyberspace, it works much better for this cyber age. I feel Bitcoin is better precious metal then gold to use as a money...
