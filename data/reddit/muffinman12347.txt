Mate, we were originally convicts that were moved here and over time made our own freedom.

Yeah I mean techniqually my all up value I hold dropped over 10K from max to now, but meh, I believe strongly it will go back up. Even if it stays like this, I've still made a hella profit.

I'd like to see you try and make oven less instant brownies. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:07:16
Look it is, but it just worked in his favor. Just like me. Took out $15k for bitcoin, putting it all in and not taking any out to even pay back any of the loan. Is it the smartest safest move? Definitely not. Is it high risk high reward? Fuck yeah.

This and to go clothes shopping like once every 6 months for a few new items of clothes and not have to worry about how much I spent on a few meals and a few items of clothing.

Not necessarily, not sure what they used at all for this. But when I was 13, my science put a bunch of I believe methane into soapy water. Asked me to pick up a handful. Next second she lit my hands on fire and it burned for a few seconds and stopped. Didnt feel any heat on my hands at least the whole time. So it may be similar and if so, no it wouldnt catch fire.

Can not tell if /s or not?
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:51:35
At work hoping it continues to go down as I'm buying some when I finish. I'm scared when it starts going up now.
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:00:55
Yeah... my fee on my last transaction was $82 it kinda hurt 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:05:44
You really think you can tell where we will be in 100 years? Using actual gold and silver for payment was pretty much fazed out. Normal currency in paper form is being trumped by credit and debit cards now. Whats there to stop it from taking over after mainstream adoption?
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:13:17
My brother got me into it, my parents wouldn't stop hearing us talk about it and now we got them into it. Family Christmas and my nan hears about it.
Yeah she definitely did not get behind it as she couldn't understand how numbers on a screen could equal real money. Any point we made was mute. But some people are like that.
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:40:00
Was reading a post from June predicting $10k by 2020 and look where we are now. I really hope we are all undervaluing this and it exceeds our expectations. Also if you're right, would still be crazy happy with it. Tyler 12/12
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:12:02
Right there with you. I'm thinking of investing more the pay everything off after another 6 months.
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:37:28
Well kind of, I was on localbitcoins website and there was a cash transfer for that much and much more. Ended up meeting them in person because it was easier, but thats beside the point.
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:08:23
Well before bitcoin I had no debts, took out a small loan to get some. Even if I literally goes down to $0 and I lose everything. I can pay back that debt in under a year if I wanted to and my life would pretty much be the same besides that one year with less money. Now on the other hand, if it does what I think it will do and continue to go up over time. That one year gamble of possibly having less money, will pay off hopefully to where I'll have enough money to support myself for a few years or even do something with it that I can actually live of the money I make from selling the bitcoin alone.
But that's just me, I've always been a gambler and I truly believe in bitcoin, not as a stock but for its functionality as well as I was using it to purchase stuff before it took off like it has. Risk big to win big, but if I lose big as well, it's nothing compared to what I could win.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:15:03
I will pay off any money I owe with it and hodl the rest past a million!
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:18:36
I would love this. I want to get to a point where I make enough money that I get bored not working and pick a casual job at a random place that I ACTUALLY ENJOY! Instead of working at a place I hate to live.
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:22:34
I'm very happy for you, I'm the opposite and I'm keeping my initial investment in the for a while if not the whole time because that's what I feel like is right. Girlfriend would agree with you and your wife though.
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:22:04
I would love this as well!
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:24:49
I actually put a restriction on myself after my 21st birthday, due to losing a few hundred dollars at the casino that I wasnt going to gamble till my 22nd birthday. A few thousand dollars later into bitcoin. It's my 'investment' but my god it gives me the rush like gambling.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:24:59
Bought at $4700 dropped to $3500 felt like an idiot. A bit of hodling later and yeah, I'm just glad I bought when I did. Give it time and perspective will change.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:40:13
Hodl long enough till it can be used the same as fait, no tax needed :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:12:17
Thank you internet stranger, I'll take your word for it and keep hodling!
@_date: 2017-12-18 10:41:45
This hurt somewhere deep within my body for some reason.
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:53:48
Reading this post made me question myself a bit. I bought when it was $4300 and my plan was just to hodl it for 10 years and see where I am from there. But I have been watching it go up a lot and money can be tempting, so either need to stick to my goal or make a plan.
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:17:57
$25,000 AUD as well :)
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:04:21
I hope so, bank only let me get out not even half the amount I wanted, need to buy more again soon.

I can get free electricity running non stop. But the internet there is really bad... How would this affect me if I was considering getting into it?
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:40:00
I bought 3 months ago, I'm doing amazing, but I dont know where I stand as a hodler or a newbie? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:03:17
Zoom out, see how pronounced it really is in comparison to the massive rise.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:06:51
Yeah I will really need to know more about this please 
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:59:09
That throws a lot more perspective on it. 4.4 percent of the world population. I definitely believe in time we can overtake total USD in circulation.

I myself got out a load for bitcoin, I know it wasn't the smartest move. But I weighed up the risk vs reward and it was something I was comfortable doing. Everyone has their own perspective on it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:31:55
This was a nicely resolved misunderstanding. We need more people like this.
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:41:40
Thank you, probably the best answer I could have gotten is to do my own research instead of info off random internet strangers (no offence obviously) :)
I'll look into it, thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:18:27
403% profit at the moment and I still haven't cashed out my initial investment, I'm willing to risk it to gain more. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:05:18
I personally used localbitcoin as I wanted to dump $15k into it and I saw it keep rising in price. Took a pretty big hit with the rates there but compared to the few days how much bitcoin went up, worth it.
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:05:56
Sorry, explanation?
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:40:20
I just need to finish work before I buy more, I really dont want the price to go up again for at least another 5 hours please!
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:15:12
Bitcoin makes me feel so weird, I put my initial investment in and don't want to touch it. Getting rich in bitcoin but scrapping by day to day. Such a weird contrast. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:53:24
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:53:17
My brother set me up with everything originally and the investment grew a lot so I wanted it off my phone onto a ledger to keep them safe. Didn't really have a choice at that point.
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:30:49
You tried :)

I like the optimism here! Choo Choo 
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:26:11
This, my profits have gone up heaps since I started investing and non stop talking about it. Then again, so has my girlfriends impatience about me talking about it as well as her fear and stress about me losing all my money anytime she sees something in the news about it dropping. 
@_date: 2019-06-27 07:38:31
Yeah, I’m considering bankruptcy atm for about $40k debt with no job atm or for the last 6 months at all. Been dealing with mental illness for the last 9 years but finally gotten some help and despite everything bad happening. I’m starting to see a positive shift. 
But yeah, just goes round, can’t appreciate all the good things without a bit of bad happening once in a while.
@_date: 2019-06-27 08:20:52
Brother and I used the dark net to buy a few drugs. 5 btc at the time. Was a number of years ago.
@_date: 2019-06-27 07:33:39
What about the people that bought at the all time high?
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:30:05
I will back this up with personal experience, sold when I thought it jumped up and was going to dip, not because I was scared, but because I wanted to buy in at a lower price... then I got scared and bought back in too early and made a little money but could have easily made more. All this was done at 3am...
@_date: 2019-06-27 04:51:42
This makes me so happy and sad at the same time. I managed to acquire 5 btc around 2 years ago. However was dealing with undiagnosed bipolar and lost my job. Lost 6 jobs back to back actually. Had to take out some btc a little bit at a time when it was pretty much at the bottom till I had nothing left. Hurts so much knowing how much I could have had. But bittersweet knowing I was right to buy it in the first place. Life just fucked me around.
@_date: 2019-06-27 07:35:09
This actually hit me really hard, thank you.
@_date: 2018-03-31 05:07:45
Had to sell a small fraction of mine to feed myself :( was sad, but the bitcoin sure did taste delicious.
@_date: 2018-02-18 03:41:16
I still have another $8k aud before my second large investment catches up to breaking even.
@_date: 2018-02-04 10:04:48
Think of the karma ;)
Common, post an updated one. Please?
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:10:34
Bought in at 17k... still waiting
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:01:03
Yes this is what I was going for, on my phone.
