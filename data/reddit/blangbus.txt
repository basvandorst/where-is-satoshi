i celebrated my dollar cost average (625) crossing into the green w/ my biggest purchase yet.  Bitcoin greeted me w/ an immediate $10 correction =P.

Professional producer here.  A few years ago, I sat on a plane and drafted out this exact idea.  If I were to change the industry myself, this is exactly how I would do it.  Everyone is the A&amp;R and can invest in an artist themselves.  Social network just like myspace where you are either an artist or just listener.  I think where I sort of hit a mental roadblock, in how you could actually regulate such an industry.  It would be ripe for ripoffs if you ask me.

Are you on OSX 10.7? It did that until I got 10.8.  Also, could be the crappy USB cable.

just put a few ethercoins in a safe place.  smart contracts seem like a promising development.

OP here. The purchases that I locked in during this bull run (before this incedent and below current market value) were cancelled outright by Coinbase, so I am annoyed.  I'm generally not an asshole, but to date I still haven't received any update from this company.  Updates, as in, the following date is when you will be able to make purchases again.  I'm currently getting verified at other exchanges.

ack.  spare me the sarcasm if this is sarcasm.  no response on a resolution yet, and the only way that I actually got a response is by posting on reddit.  go figure.  
@_date: 2015-11-07 14:48:49
Still no word from Coinbase as to the resolution of this issue.  Just an acknowledgement from our friend John here, that yes, there is an issue.

I did receive an update as to why my trading account was suspended.  In case you're wondering, lawnmower accessed a closed account by default somehow, and subsequently they froze the whole thing over a canceled $10 purchase of bitcoin.  It's not resolved in the slightlest, and it really took some badgering to get a response.  I'm not even going to respond to the email in fear that it drops in queue further. 
But anyway, they could tell people maybe in auto emails that you're experiencing high volume, an estimated wait time, or the fact that if I respond to the email, that I will experience a further delay than normal. This is all a bit of a head scratcher.

"Is it possible that you've been following up on the email during the course of these 2 days? We try to prioritize customers on a first come first serve basis, unfortunately the nature of our helpdesk software is such that when a customer follows up before we respond, it is moved to the back of the queue."  IM SORRY BUT THAT IS THE DUMBEST FUCKING THING.  IM SORRY.  IF I RESPOND, AND SAY, HEY GUYS WHATS GOING ON HERE... I GO TO THE BACK OF THE QUEUE?  WOW. WOW.

As an NY resident, I really need them to add ETH to their exchange.  LTC is nice, but seeming less relevant at this point.
