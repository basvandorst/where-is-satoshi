Thanks for your feedback.
1. There are other limitations, for example, if I have no capital, and I'm a guy from Laos (example) it's harder for me to move money in and out of the exchanges.
2. You have to be quick, people that did FX arb back then made money, now it's almost impossible. Arb also fills in the gap that exists between the exchanges.

That doesn't do arbitrage.
If you look, all the exchanges  have different buy and sell price point at all times, and these are usually quite huge.
The software will allow you to execute two/three trades simultaneously on 3 different exchanges so that you'll make a profit.

What kind of commodities? What's the current market problem?

You can't really do anything with it, the only way for you to connect with someone is by clicking through to their FB profile and message them there. 
We're growing organically and implementing weighted karma soon so refs from someone reputable will weight more. It's possible for you to create a network of fake ID's but it's very easy to tell (account age, number of friends, numer of pictures uploaded etc). 
We're also implementing more oAuth's so you can verify your twitter/instagram/github etc and get more rep from just doing that. 
Feel free to make suggestions, the things you brought up are really interesting to me.

It's for you to know if you or someone else is legit or not. If you have a profile, you can ask someone you just dealt with to leave you a feedback and it will be kept forever for you to use in the future.
