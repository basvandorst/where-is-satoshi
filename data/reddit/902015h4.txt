Crisis caused by the mass majority buying into shitcoins from ICOs pouring their entire life savings, and borrowing debt by opening another mortgage. When the few that are ponzi-ing up by pumping and dumping is when it goes belly up. Calling it man. The crypto bubble will be the next great recession. Just need tether to be caught as a scam and BAM...DOMINO EFFECT.

Haha you have to pound your chest man like Matt McConaughey in Wolf of Wall Street and say I got this.

Would you say anything below the top 20 coins on coinmarketcap are shitcoins?
@_date: 2018-08-15 17:59:29
How you feel about tether? I heard they can't show the money since they claim their coin is back by US dollars.

Oh nice. I'll look into it then. Man, my friend hounded on me to jump in 2014 but I thought it was too much of a headache. Then met a kid, Erik Finman that made $100k off BTC told me to jump in and again I brushed that off. Finally going to take a leap in it after all. FML. 
Any other crypto you're into? I'm looking to just connect w/ people.

When you buy, do you buy denominations like in fractions? Sorry I'm a noob. Also futures on Bitcoin is on CME and CBOE will be interesting.
