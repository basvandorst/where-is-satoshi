Sounds cute, but def not true. Especially when you go to buy back your Bitcoins with next weeks paycheck and now you can only buy .75 instead of the 1.5 you spent, but th merchent sells your 1.5 at double the fiat it was worth to him.

No, not at all.
1.  Ppl who sold the house to speculate back in Nov are cashing out at every chance they get.
2.  New altcoin hype is attracting bitcoin speculation and driving ppl to take gains immediately when those altcoins jump(alt coins are bought and sold in btc only so only bitcoin suffers from this sell off) 
3.  Ppl are nervous about the silk road auction.
So even though the entire world is announcing that they are accepting bitcoin a good 1/3 of the community is actually selling, even if it doesn't seem like it.

Iceland has a PUBLIC citizen identification system. The Auroracoin dev is using this well known system to distribute the coins. The database is public and available online. Iceland is very diff than America or the rest of Europe. The pirate party actively holds over 11% of congreasional seats who back Auroracoin and the citizens have already jailed bankers for bank misappropriations unlike the USA bailout tactic.

You must really be ignorant of the facts. The Federal Reserve makes a massive amount of money from making money. Its the reason why taxation and interest exist. There is no actual logically sound reason to not like premined coins. Its just unfamiliar and most of you are severely misinformed. Auroracoin is a legit social project that will go down in history. Spaincoin will probably go no where. Never the less both these things have been said about Bitcoin.

"Shrem was aware Silk Road was being used to buy and sell illegal drugs and said in one e-mail that such sales funded “a decent percentage of the overall Bitcoin economy,” according to the complaint. “Wow, Silk Road actually works,” he said in another e-mail, explaining that he had received a shipment of marijuana brownies, prosecutors said."
"Shrem was accused of knowingly allowing Faiella to use his company’s services to buy Bitcoins for Silk Road customers, and also of personally processing Faiella’s orders, giving him discounts on his high-volume transactions and failing to file suspicious activity reports."

I have moved 160 btc through the community(ranging from $72 - $900 USD per bitcoin) and must say... I have recently moves to Dogecoin cuz of this same issue. 
Bitcoin is worrying me because the atmosphere has turned Into exactly what we have on Wall street and in the big global banks. Look around all of bitcoin today is about getting charged 1%-5% for anything you want to do. Big companies are accepting bitcoin and cashing them out, trying to strip you of your purchasing power. Exchanges buy and sell only when's its convenient to them. Meanwhile technologists are being shunned for big mouthed opportunists who would fit in better with used car salesmans or celebrity gossip columnists. 
The banks will create their own big corp coin sponsored by Google or Amazon or Samsung or even Apple. Sadly I think bitcoin will implode around 2016 and interest will shift.

First of all they take the ask/bid prices directly from the major altcoin exchanges, and note how many btc has been exchanged and for what. 
If you have been paying attention, bitcoin itself once had a market cap of a little over 13 billion. Now the entirety of all coins is a little over 13 billion.
Case in point dogecoin. 50 million in btc has moved there in the past 10 days. Now early dogecoins adopters are cashing out in mass cuz they never were into Bitcoins anyway. Rinse and repeat... Fill In the gaps. 
Altcoins aren't hurting bitcoins but at this rate they are holding back the streak we just came off of. Just my opinion.

Ross is a brilliant guy, but he got caught.
There is no legal or even moral basis as to why he should be freed. 
And to address all bitcoinera who hate him, you are all sadly mistaken. Ross is the reason bitcoin has seen growth in the past 2 years, and his tens of thousands of Bitcoins are keeping tens of millions locked into the community forever. If anything you can look at Ross as a sort of Robin hood. Stealing from the drug addicts and pushers and giving to the tech savvy progressives.

Honestly it depends on YOU as an account holder not the bank itself. If you live in the middle of no where and have had a consistent spotty/low income they will flag you. If you live in a big city and have a decent sized direct deposit, the bank will look the other way and actually try to sell you financial services and instruments that they offer. 
I have experienced this even before dealing with Coinbase of Mt. Gox.

Even if the price of bitcoin goes to $300 you will still not break even on any equipment currently available. Difficulty will only go up this is obvious. The only people who made an amount of real profit were Avalon batch 1&amp;2  miners and early KNC Jupiter miners. No one wjo purchased from cointerra or hasfast will see any break even... ever. The only way they can win is if they hold all the coins they generate from mining. In which case they could have just bought Bitcoins when they originally bought the miner. 
@_date: 2013-08-19 21:53:52
Coinbases advantage is that it is more liquid. Its frankly the best option for an American speculator. Early Coinbase adopters were just handsomely rewarded today.
