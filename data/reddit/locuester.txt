I am known for my line at the office in our  slack channel, “bitcoin only goes down”.

Why not just up the blocksize
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:00:04
I sell half every time my total value hits a certain significant number. It’s worked out great. Sure I’d have had more if I just held the whole time, but this way I hedged the risk and enjoyed the good fortune along the way. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:57:11
Like blocksize. But they won’t fix!!!
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:54:24
It won’t be needed anymore. Bitcoin just took a major hit in the pr and adoption department. 
I’ve been in this space for 5 years and I’m beyond disappointed at where core took us. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:21:54
Keep the off chain work going, remove the limit. 
2 TB full historical node isn’t that bad. Most would use trimming and not be even close to that. 
Adoption has been stunted. Quite possibly killed. It is no longer a peer to peer currency. It’s been killed. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:52:02
If only it were a peer to peer currency with little to no fees....  Bitcoin is not what it was supposed to be and this is a glaring proof. You and I are supposed to be exchanges.

You are a fake shill account with fake and ridiculous botted information. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 07:13:02
Sure, with a bank account (excluding prepaid visas for fees and credit cards since a 12 year old can't get one). A bank account would require going somewhere and opening it, waiting for an insecure card, being sure to disable overdraft and such, dealing with tx mins to prevent fees, and all that other junk. 
Then when I want to use money I'd have to do a bank transfer, or drive cash to the bank. Are you seriously even comparing these?!

How do I interact daily when the price of a small miner fee (1,000 bits) approaches my daily income. I get to interact once per day?  And then the looming fee market that's being praised - that certainly isn't enabling any interaction. I have to load up an address to do anything. It mining does nothing for me. 
@_date: 2015-12-01 13:35:48
They could close out what's on the order books, but the price would subsequently skyrocket and they wouldn't have ALL the Bitcoin, just that which was available for sale at an exchange. New sellers would keep pushing the price higher and higher, enjoying the trip to the moon.

You mean a transaction included in a block not conforming to core (&gt;1MB), or at that point, the BIP101 activated chain. There is no "bip101 tx". 
In that case, your output is still spendable on the core chain, until a miner makes a block with the tx there too. 
That day will be a fascinating study of decentralization and game theory. I expect low volumes as it approaches. No one wants to be in the middle of a fork; it wasn't fun at all last time - and that was before these big corporate players got involved.

@_date: 2015-12-24 15:59:46
You don't have $10,000 worth of bitcoin.  You have a random number known as a private key and random numbers can't be taxed. It's also not provable that you're the only one with a certain random number, so even ownership of that number is unclear. Move along.

As long as the "downloaded" blocks were in agreement with the IP network, there is no downside. Please collaborate with me regarding possible technologies for this. I live out in the country and would love to setup a shortwave that broadcasts blocks. 
@_date: 2015-12-01 19:42:53
In my case, I fear that perhaps I'm not familiar enough with this protocol you speak of. Is there a specification. I'm very familiar with the software and source code, which uses "address" liberally in the way I speak of it. 
Perhaps you can point me to the protocol spec which causes the addresses to work *accidentally*. 
@_date: 2015-12-13 17:27:48
This is how I do it. It supports BIP39 passwords so I just make up a password for each of the kids' accounts (technically it could just ether names, but something more complex gives added security if the Trezor seed is compromised). 
Then I just grab the xpub for the account and use bip32.org to generate receive addresses every month.

He is 15. I've been paying him and my daughter their allowance in bitcoin for years. 
@_date: 2015-12-25 19:49:20
The answer to this is in the whitepaper. As transaction volume increases with adoption, transaction fees are expected to overtake the mining reward. The mining reward is just a temporary subsidy to kickstart the process and create original coins. 
If everyone pays transaction fees of a penny and there are a couple billion transactions per day, that's where the incentive to mine comes from. This is also a reason that people argue for larger or unlimited block sizes. If we limit the block size, we eventually force the fees up to reward the miners.  
The whitepaper has no mention of a limit on block size. In fact, it would negate the mention it makes to fees coupled with volume overtaking the reward.

He is talking about the Apple Store. That's not exactly a GitHub project. 
@_date: 2015-12-01 01:53:08
While he wasn't very polite with his words, he is right. Don't tell a service to send coins to an address that you don't own. I realize you're new to this; I've lost coins in similar ways.

If they could toss more than 1MB of them in a block it'd be different though. 
@_date: 2015-06-05 16:25:36
And most importantly, the blocks that a new trimmed node will need are available. 
If I understand correctly, this means that all full, untrimmed nodes can disappear and Bitcoin would still continue to function - AND - be able to replicate untrimmed blocks to new nodes. The entire history is no longer required, except for a full audit from genesis. 
@_date: 2015-12-17 16:08:23
Yep. It's going to be exciting to see where this lands. Miners can't block these transactions. I could cleverly hash the Merkle into a valid bitcoin address and no one could tell it apart from any other tx. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 02:05:49
That is indeed the theory. A deflationary currency. 
@_date: 2015-12-17 05:54:21
What do you mean by "address"?  Bitcoin has no concept of an address.  Quoting you from an older discussion we have had. 


This is a valid script he proposes. You'd merely give the friend the txid that you sent, which has the output that he can execute in 50 years. 
Did I misunderstand you, or the protocol?

No. Not at all. I comment to respond to individuals and contribute to the community. Not for Internet points, fame, or recognition  
@_date: 2015-12-23 01:50:20
But he could send the second transaction in a half hour, once the first is securely in a block, with a txid. 
Intelligent assumption: It will not be mined though. It's an invalid spend. The code prob does not recurse up time locks to check if the output is spendable when the next output is spendable. It just sees that it's unspendable right now and discards it. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 04:25:38
Non Bitcoin data stored forever?  Oh cmon. Prune your node. Keeping every block at home is so 2013. 
@_date: 2015-12-20 03:35:23
It is true, and you are correct. Typically you will see large sums like this split into dozens or even hundreds of small addresses for this reason.  It's also affecting his min miner fee because age of the input is taken into account. 
Whoever keeps using that 3000 coin address either doesn't care about needing 0-conf, or is ignorant of their actions. 
@_date: 2015-12-04 13:08:04
I'll be LukeJr:
There are no addresses. Addresses just accidentally work in the Bitcoin protocol. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 23:01:33
Of course it does. Pressure to up the blocksize will cause nodes to start upgrading first to clients with a higher max size. Then, all it takes is one key exchange and mining pool to declare they're upgrading on a certain date and the pressure starts. We get out the popcorn and see if the other miners are going to follow suit, or let one pool win all the blocks for a while as they figure out if they should join. A gigantic week of playing chicken with each other until someone caves. 
Without decentralization and open source, we would be gridlocked in this decision making process forever. Instead, let's see what a free market will accomplish under enormous pressure. 
The price will shoot up in advance of the pending split as people would rather own coins on both chains than to purchase during the inevitable uncertainty that'll take place. 
Oh it'll be fun, but don't worry, we will get bigger block sizes. Just hang in there with lots of popcorn.

If I recall correctly, Gavin actually asked everyone to do the opposite - to mine on 0.8 (the newer). It was BTCGuild, and Slush as well possibly(?), that stepped in and offered the correct solution of reverting to 0.7. Good on them, they lost thousands but did what was right for the common good. 
@_date: 2015-12-17 05:32:18
They are depending on the Bitcoin chain being immutable. They are admitting that it is the de facto standard for immutability. 
Because of this, bitcoin as a currency must succeed -OR- fees must go up substantially, inverse to the supply limiting rules of Bitcoin, or it is no longer immutable. 
In other words, someone needs to pay for this decentralized security - either in transaction volume going way up, or fees going way up. I hope it's transactions going up, but either way, bitcoins remain valuable as a means of securing the blockchain (paying miners)
@_date: 2015-12-03 23:13:02
They may have been secretly mining on top of it trying to get another block after they found it instantly - hoping for grabbing two in a row. After 30 mins their code might say "submit that one we found in case we never get ahead because otherwise we did all this work for nothing". You never know what tricks they're pulling to gain an edge. 
Did f2 get the following block too? It'd surprise me if they didn't. No way they are SPV mining for 30 mins without a reason.

Do you trust that Coinbase doesn't keep two unencrypted private keys to the multisig somewhere?  Or that they can't be hacked in transit, during setup, RNG bug, etc etc.  I don't.
Mt Gox lessons learned man, it's so simple to move money into a BIP32/39/44 wallet and paper backup the phrase. Can even split it into shares of you want. I use [this work in progress]( page of mine to split/print/recover sensitive info like BIP39 phrases. :)
@_date: 2015-12-16 05:33:54
I don't think that's what he was saying, but it brings up a marvelous philosophical discussion about rising fees and rising values. How will the min fees correct themselves when a bitcoin is worth $5000?  A few market would be nice, but not if constrained by size.

The value of gold varies dramatically over time, market conditions, geographical location, etc. same as any other money. To say it's value never changes is naive - it never changes relative to what? 
No sense arguing semantics, but a given quantity of gold had more buying power in the world commodity markets 5 years ago than it does today.

They did the analysis and the work, then hey implemented and tested a working solution.  No one else on core dev agrees and many others feel they were too rash to do this. Gavin spent months explaining in detail all of his analysis. Mike helped out by getting it into binaries.

So in that sense, they did the work. They are done. They're waiting for the others to catch up. :)

I'm holding because I *know* it will increase in value due to fiat deflation. 
@_date: 2015-12-17 05:35:56
But they're accepting the Bitcoin blockchain as the de facto standard of immutable time stamping. Thus proving its value. 
If every MySQL database time stamped its checksum every hour, that's a whole lot of tx fees getting paid. Add to it banks and legal systems, notaries, etc. don't underestimate their acceptance of it for this. Notary services could be a substantial part of the network. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 04:11:45
No, they are spent on whatever chain the node you broadcast it to is on.  Or, whatever chain your wallet is on. 
This whole "multiple chains" thing is causing an awful lot of confusion for people. It's not going to be some flag or option in Bitcoin. No developer will be supporting that.

*Edit: I have solved my problem of allowing my children to spend their allowance online without parental involvement if desired. *
This is perhaps being overlooked by many... I pay my children's allowances in bitcoin.  Kids are ages 11 and 14. This has been scoffed at by many when I mention it, but consider the following:
- My kids live with my ex, approx 40 miles away, and I have them every other weekend (being able to pay from a distance is helpful). 
- I act as a fiat exchange for them at anytime (proxy through mom if needed but never has been). Sometimes we are at 7-11 and they want to get something. Simple for them to just trade for cash. 
- eGifter sells Amazon gift cards for exact dollar amounts &gt; $5. 
- Microsoft accepts bitcoin. 
- Steam games are available at steambitshop.com. 
What this has allowed:
- Early understanding of ecommerce. 
- Empowered to buy online without my oversight. 
- Knowledge of cryptocurrency, exchange rates, and related technology at an early age. 
My children went through a typical adoption curve. Initial excitement, post-honeymoon complaints and pains, empowerment, freedom, ease of use. 
My kids are familiar with wallets and backup procedures, each having fav wallets and understand the denomination Maths associated (breadwallet is bits, mycelium is BTC, merchants are BTC). I keep their BIP32 xpub keys and pay a unique address weekly - it's been pretty educational myself writing little scripts to generate addresses for the different BIP39 clients. I keep the amount a round number in BTC but adjust according with the exchange rate to keep it at around $7 USD/week. 
My daughter has things showing up from Amazon all the time, my son saves for Xbox games, buys domains, hosting, steam games, etc. they trade money amongst themselves as needed as well. Sometimes we make silly bets with each other and can settle debts immediately. Fiat exchange can be done in realtime at POS instead of having IOUs with me. 
It's been pretty incredible. This past weekend my 11 year old daughter got $20 from her grandma, and much to grandma's amazement, gave it to me in exchange for bitcoin. She then showed grandma how she uses her iPhone to open Amazon, shop for a mini trampoline that she wants, switch to eGifter and buy a gift card using bitcoin, switch back and apply the giftcard to her Amazon purchase. The trampoline showed up 2 days later - and we were on vacation at a rental condo. Needless to say grandma was amazed at my daughters ease of use and comfort with ecommerce - all sans credit cards and adult permission/supervision. 
When amazon accepts bitcoin, this gets far easier for us, and lowers the barrier to entry. Before anyone speaks up about purse.io - their site is not mobile friendly, so I hesitate to get the kids involved. Being the newest generation, they really moan and groan about needing to turn on laptops. 
Personally, I feel that this is a killer use case for bitcoin, but due to the downvote brigades I've been hit with before when I mention it - I've been hesitant to share the experience. 
**Is this worthy of a blog post or article/interview with a mainstream or Bitcoin publication?**

Not true. They can trust the block "downloaded" from the airwaves if all other nodes agree on its hash. It's just saving block download bandwidth by grabbing it from the air. If consensus with the IP network wasn't met, it could throw it away and use IP. 
It's far less bandwidth to confirm the hash downloaded from the airwaves than to download the block every ten minutes. I've been thinking about this same scenario for a while now.

You mean like connecting to a global decentralized network of in trusted peers, whom as a whole can be trusted?  That's what Bitcoin is. 
I'm afraid you're talking about the buzzword "cloud" which typically means shared compute and server resources owned by an entity. 
Very different things. Bitcoin is a secure, decentralized cloud.  It doesn't need an insecure, centralized cloud for any reason.

This is not unusual at all. Also, I see that you're using a hosted wallet - on blockchain.org. This is also not secure as you don't exclusively own the private keys. They can take your money next, or suffer a hack, or an outage, and you're screwed.

Satoshi's paper covered strict ownership of private keys as well, as a basis for account ownership. In addition throughout the years the entire team has been adamantly against capital controls. 
For you to imply otherwise, just because it wasn't specifically mentioned in the tech whitepaper, is silly. I'm not 100% sure that it isn't mentioned but am on a phone and it's late. 
@_date: 2015-12-23 04:44:50
It does bring up an interesting tx type possibility though. With some code changes, we could detect a script with a cltv output and use its time lock when determining the spendability of the inputs. If it's legitimately spending an output that it is guaranteed to own in the future, it should be able to spend if the output is also locked to a even further future time. 
It probably gets too complex tho with multisig and binary conditions (cltv OR a certain sig shouldnt be spendable in advance, even if locked to a time).

Read the BIP link below. You are misunderstanding it a little. The new op code can be used as part of a pay to script address. Ex: I create an address, much like multisig, which can be spent by actor A after 3 months, or actor B anytime.  That's a simple example, but having this ability allows complex scenarios to exist. 
I can imagine such a feature being used by savings services where your addresses being created all have a 10 year out lock time for your children or other loved ones to access funds in the event of your death. 
That's a simple example to hopefully help you see at a high level how it's different from what you are afraid of.

Correct. It's the only number that has no reason except for spam prevention. It's recorded as being a temp protection from that, and wasn't lifted.

No, they are spent on whatever chain the node you broadcast it to is on.  Or, whatever chain your wallet is on.

Just the txid needs to be sent to the receiver, or they can write code that looks for locked payment tx's. No wallet or explorer will see the script you wrote as being to him, even though he can manually craft a tx to spend the outputs of your tx. 
Your script is perfectly ok - it just requires some engineering to spend it, in 50 years.

I'm a software engineer and I will be moving forward with writing this. I've done a couple crypto things and am getting pretty deep down the rabbit hole.  
I've got a custom compiled bitcoin node on a rasp pi 2 (performance enhanced), and am slowly adding more tools to it to make it a feature rich, secure, user friendly *Bank*.  Private key storage is out of scope; my mental architecture has private key storage and signing being handled by the user and their personal device(s).  **Even my own bank shouldn't be able to touch my money.**  Scheduled transactions and payment requests will be handled in the future with offline signing by the user, interactively.
Why Insight though?  It's my understanding that is being replaced by bitcore-node because insight-api doesn't play nice with the non sequential blocks in 0.10. 
**EDIT: I realize who I'm replying to now...  Of course I'll contact you - your *marvelous* product is the reason I'm writing this!  Me and my kids need to monitor the TREZOR, without having the TREZOR.**

Yeah, this was what I was looking at originally a couple of months ago.  However, now Electrum doesn't seem as up to date as the bitcore development team is, and they have a functional bitcore-node API (previously *Insight*) which serves the same purpose as Electrum's server (Stratum?).  Electrum, while active in guthub, seems really disorganized.
The bitpay team is crushing along architecting solutions and I think I should hop on that train...  :)  
The *problem* is, that it seems no one has done this before...  I guess that makes sense, people aren't running full nodes as much, and certainly whole families (like mine) aren't privacy aware bitcoin users.

Nothing will give you the private key or seed of the trezor. That's the point of the trezor. :)
Your coins are safe. Use a different computer, use a different network connection. The tx didn't broadcast, but some node is telling your web wallet that it did. 
Private message me in 8 hours if it's still a problem, on a different computer, on a different network. Most of all, stay calm. The coins are safe as long as you DO NOT UPGRADE THE TREZOR RIGHT NOW.

Doing it this way provides decentralized double spend prevention, and eliminates lawyers / notories. Today, when someone wants to trade a pre-IPO asset, there is a whole litany of overhead to verify and record the transaction, then expose the history publicly and anonymously for full transparency.  Doing it this way eliminates that without adding risk.
The same reason it makes for a good currency.  I feel like you're just trolling at this point - don't you understand what bitcoin is? :)

We aren't all hoping for financial meltdown and world recession. Instead we are laying the foundation to help, in my humble opinion, stabilize the economic backbone of mankind.  I don't need to be rich - I want to be safe, secure, and content.  We have the technology now to rework the global economy into a new model - one mathematically sound, and minimally risky with regards to manipulation, if fully adopted. 
When I talk about how Bitcoin is better currency and store of value than the monetary system used by today, it doesn't mean that I want apocalypse and failure of today's system. I'd much prefer the slow migration, understanding that it's not going to be a smooth process to recover from the current state of affairs.

Mobile is now the primary platform for viewing video. I made the argument years ago and I'll make it again to you. 
The video shot of a vertical ATM machine maximized the usage of the lens on my camera phone.  The same shot horizontally would have required I stand back 10 feet, and you would see rows of grocery items filling both sides of the video. 
Watching my video on a mobile platform looks great. I choose the orientation that fits the shot.

This is an idea that I mull over. I have a rasp pi 2 as a Bitcoin and namecoin fullnode. I'm slowly adding services to it. I think running "insight" on it is my next step. That is a block chain explorer. That means I run my own Bitcoin node and chain explorer off a $35 device. The node is compiled from my own branch of Bitcoin, which I merge things into early - such as some of Gavin's recent performance stuff. I also plan on implementing the 20mb block limit now. Why not vote by just running the code. :)

Sender always pays the fee. Note however that it doesn't compare to the credit card fees. For that transaction if they paid .001 BTC, it'd be fine. That's only a quarter - hardly comparable to the $30 that a credit card would charge. 
The problem is that the clients' wallet software needs to properly present this as an option. Unfortunately, to my knowledge, wallet software isn't mature enough to handle this right now - although many wallets aim for estimates that will do priority confirmation. This clients wallet didn't - the transaction was too large (based on number of inputs, not based on dollar amount) - which is a detail that the user should t need to worry about, but in this new world of Bitcoin, they do.

"Honor both chains"?
What do you mean here?  An exchange would upgrade and follow the 20MB chain. To do business with them (reliably), your wallet would have to also use the 20MB chain. 
Businesses don't have to or want to "honor both chains". In fact, that would allow everyone to spend and transact on them both somehow. That'd be terribly confusing and double the money supply.

The IRS would have to know about and locate all associated addresses, prove it, and get my key.

However, miners are also easy to replace (money alone buys hardware and electricity quickly, no marketing or user adoption is needed).

@_date: 2015-05-16 00:08:49
Not true at all. Stocks are a store of value outside of currency. They are a percentage of a company. 
If fiat died, that manufacturing plant will still run (I understand, mass closing a and such as the markets move, etc, I mean grand scale). The people will still show up for work, those products will still come off the line, and people will pay and be paid in **something**. a good company **produces** something - intellectual or tangible - that has value.  People don't disappear and stop working when fiat disappears. Machinery and brains don't stop working. They just need to find a new store of value and payment system that doesn't disappear. 
Will there be turmoil and chaos during fiat financial crisis?  Sure, but a good company survives it by **producing something**.  Find a company that you believe that adds value to society, and buy a little piece of it.

@_date: 2015-05-02 21:25:38
With fiat, they seize it, then you have to fight to get it back. With bitcoin, they'd have to prove it was theirs through due process of law before I had to surrender it or be imprisoned. At least that's a bit more protection. 
Also with bitcoin, I could go to my grave denying ownership and the government still wouldn't be able to touch it. Even if I simply handed someone else the keys. 
This is the reason the U.S. is uncomfortable with bitcoin. I believe they'll implement AML regulations for it which will include dynamic lists of addresses which are "hot". If that happens, fungibility of bitcoin is dead. 
@_date: 2016-01-05 05:42:09
I'm not encouraging investing in bitcoin. You're confusing investing and saving. 
They typically save money for 2 to 3 months. They understand the volatility over that period. They've seen both sides of the outcome. Again I've been doing this for a year and a half, and they have the option to go with USD cash anytime.
The difference between your opinion and my opinion is that I have facts. When you and I were children, digital money didn't exist. It does now. The children enjoy having money that they can send to friends and family and receive from friends and family, then turn around and spend it on Xbox, server hosting, Amazon, and just about anything else you can find online.
I understand that you may not be as immersed into the peer-to-peer bitcoin world like I am. But my family has been quite perceptive of it, and it's been nice to use as a ledger (a form of money, IOU, between us).

This is a favorite feature of Armory for me, being able to choose the inputs to use in a transaction. 
This paragraph also caught my eye for the same reason it caught yours - it is leaking far too much information. If all wallets operate this way, not only is it possibly leaking a coin quantity that is unnecessary, it is also stating that this spend is that particular wallets oldest input. This is eliminating a proportionally large part of the blockchain from being in that wallet's UTXO pool. If I was doing analysis on the blockchain, this is like a dream come true.
Unspent outputs should be able to be controlled in any high quality wallet - through an advanced menu or whatever is chosen. If that's decided against for whatever reason (small footprint, simplistic, quick dev time, disclosed and accepted algorithm, etc), then it should be deterministic in nature, chosen by closeness in size and/or a function of the master seed; yet also take into account age for purposes of minimizing fees.

I'm not taking a stance on the 20mb block size with this statement - I'm just challenging your mind.

I'm not using it to teach them about investing. That would be dumb. It does allow them to save, and they understand the volatility. When grandma gives my 12 year old $20, she wants it in bitcoin. SHE wants it in bitcoin, understands the risk, yet enjoys the benefits more. It empowers both kids to be financially independent.

@_date: 2016-01-13 04:28:07
Other coins have formed from Bitcoin's **code**. Not from Bitcoin's **chain**. That's a big difference. 
The longest proof of work chain becomes the coin. There is no history to set a precedent otherwise. No cryptocoin's main chain has ever forked into two coins (sharing the same genesis). 
There were arguments about previous forks, and decisions were quickly made due to their unexpected nature. This is a planned fork - of the Bitcoin chain. If a consensus occurs causing it to have the longest proof of work, it is Bitcoin. 
If two chains emerge, I'll be amazed, but it's possible. Again though - don't spread misinformation. This isn't an alt in the traditional sense, and we are in uncharted territory. 
@_date: 2016-06-13 21:13:53
Not true if you download a pruned chain, start running it, then get the UTXO set from a trusted and realtime source. 
Is UTXO set downloading supported in any capacity?  A node doesn't require all of history. We've been over this during the days of the pruning code going live. 
@_date: 2016-06-13 23:30:27
I understand. And if you want the 100% pure version of that, you'll have to download the code, compile it, then download the full chain and index it to build up the UTXO set. 
A pruned chain is easy to get from anyone and trust it tho. Top block is the same as everyone else, you're fine. 
However, what would be possible ways to bootstrap the UTXO?  Surely there's a way to have a trusted source share the index files nightly in an effort to quickly turn on consumer devices. At that point you could 100% trust money spent from new blocks, and reasonably trust money spent from old blocks (part of the bootstrapped UTXO) until they confirmed, then you could 100% trust. Avoiding topic of orphan blocks of course, that's not related to this. 
This could be an instant-on method for consumer devices, even if temporary while the full chain downloads, indexes, and prunes in the background eventually to replace the instant-on node. Im not even thinking that's needed tho. Worst case scenario, the instant-on trusted UTXO excludes certain outputs in an effort to prevent someone spending. It'd be easy to audit by a full ~~mode~~ node tho, so I don't see it as an issue. 
@_date: 2016-06-13 04:35:33
You've demonstrated your lack of knowledge of the protocol. Hell, I'm a big block supporter and I still adamantly support any miner choosing a smaller block size for their own selfish reasons. 
Volume of fees should motivate them to mine more. Not a requirement.
@_date: 2016-06-13 23:42:12
Do you see solutions such as piggybacking on the VISA network through products such as the Shift card via Coinbase as a good solution to the scaling?  I limit my exposure by only topping off my account as needed, and all transactions occur off chain. 
It's basically the same as lightning, except there is trust and fiat conversion involved. The obvious pro being that I don't have to run a service to watch for bad actors, like lightning would require me to do. 
For me, it's the optimal configuration of my personal finances at the moment but I'd value your opinion. 
@_date: 2016-06-13 04:40:31
What do you estimate costs to be?  I see little cost in adding size to the chain. My $25 2TB USB drive can hold the chain for a long time, and can hold a pruned chain for my lifetime. 
@_date: 2016-06-14 03:18:14
Yeah. A consumer using this instant-on node would be a bit delayed in trusting pre-init output spending, but at least instantly operational in some capacity. 
I'd like a full node with initial pruned chain and UTXO seed, which also runs a full pruning node behind the scenes (say 144 to 288 blocks) until catch-up at which time it transitions into full node status. 
I could slap that including an OS on a 8GB SD card and call it a day. 8GB would handle a 288 block chain for a long time.

Or a way around that ACH altogether... Bitwage...  I get my direct deposit in Bitcoin. It's a 1 day delay. Not sure why it's faster, probably something special about direct deposits as payroll are more trusted. 
Since my employer pays a day early actually, it just makes my paycheck hit the blockchain with no real delay.
I currently have it set to a fixed percentage of my pay. I use it for budgeted Bitcoin spending (allowances, Amazon for household stuff, etc) and for savings. Yes I understand the current tax laws about gains and computing cost basis. I'm not concerned too much at this point. I'll cross that bridge at a later date.

@_date: 2015-08-20 16:19:40
There's no good source for this configuration currently.  I see it as the future of bitcoin and am somewhat pioneering it I think.  I'd like a standard home bitcoin server setup, with all other machines/devices/phones/toasters(lol)/etc being clients.
I've had to edit the source of a couple bitcoin iphone wallets to get the desired behavior.  It's still very much in its early stages of research by me.
Many wallets relying on *insight* servers allow you to specify the server name.  This achieves the same net effect, in fact I think it's better than bothering with SPV + home node.  If the node is trusted, why not just do direct lookups in this simpler way.

Nice!  This is something that I can definitely speak to. I have paid both of my children a bitcoin allowance for over a year now. They receive 20,000 bits every Friday. I vary it with the exchange rate, and give them extra here and there. 
To do what you're looking for, what about using changetip?  It allows micropayments at the tiny sizes you're looking for, and has a much nicer ToS than coinbase, which is more of a bank or exchange. 
I'd encourage you instead to just do a weekly allowance and pay the miner fee for now. It has been excellent giving my 11 year old financial independence. She orders from Amazon for delivery and now takes for granted that she can buy things that she wants. Her friends are jealous. 
I also, like you state, operate as a two way exchange anytime, but it's only been them giving me cash for bitcoin so far. My son plays xbox and steam, and can use it there.
Your suggestion of an off chain accounting system is perfect for a side project that I am working on, which is a home banking system. Everything you need to "be your own bank" from security, wallet hosting, full node, security tips, backups, key splitting, etc. 
I'll let you know if I ever implement something like you're looking for. It would definitely be good for intra-family payments. 
Similar to what you're talking about is the Lightning network. It would allow you to fund an address, and cryptographically make IOUs to one another based on those funds, in a safe and secure way, without paying any fees until settlement must happen (someone forces it to the chain, or someone tries to default). Those are the types of solutions coming in the future, but unfortunately are available yet - and certainly not in a "be your own Lightning network trusted party". Google Lightning network for more info, and for the full paper.

If I'm understanding you correctly, you want to host your own wallet service (perhaps even internal to your household, not on the net), taking deposits, giving withdrawals. But internal transfers wouldn't use the chain at all.

If the chain they are mining is ignored by merchants or exchanges, it's a useless chain. 
@_date: 2015-08-28 05:40:15
I didn't say that they would switch to another coin, just that if they don't agree with bip100, they don't upgrade their nodes. 
An interesting situation arises here - while miners are mining the longest chain that THEY accept, the other nodes in the system don't accept it. So full nodes don't propagate it and merchants/exchanges don't recognize it. If even just 20% of miners mined the non BIP100 chain, be it BIP?? Or just core v11, that chain would continue to function, and the miners would be mining a chain that is useless. Clearly, they wouldn't want to be on the side of the fork that the merchants aren't accepting. 
THAT is their motivation for not going against the wishes of the nodes, the exchanges, and the merchants. A political consensus is required for this to work across all three parties. 
I believe a large handful of merchants prefer bip101, the ones that signed that petition or whatever at least. There is strength in numbers. Miners can't control the system, they can just slow down the confirmation times and create a big game of chicken and confusion, devaluing the coin.

Rereading this, are you asking if **I** could set it up that way?

Typically instant, but you get into market nuttiness at that point. What if the exchange is down?

Companies just have to release information about what new features which can fork they are supporting.  Their websites should have an "About Our Bitcoin Node" page of sorts.  Every miner, exchange, tool, and merchant.  It'd be nice to have them all confirm to a standard too - so this data could just be scraped from their domain.
Full nodes without specific purpose, I don't think we have to worry too much.  Certainly enough nodes will be following with the trends to allow for propogation.  These tend to be hobbyists and are pretty vocal already.

Several ways to attack this vector from physical traces to monitoring propagation among my nodes.


There are ways to control propagation time, and ways to increase likelyhood of block inclusion based on miner policies (RBF, input sizes).  On the flip side there are ways to mitigate like you mentioned.  The system the ATM is using to determine risk is certainly important.  There is a third party vendro offering a service to help zero conf and detect tricky double spends.  The name eludes me, but it looks nice.

Huh?  No, a 51% attack has nothing to do with a fork. It has to do with controlling double spending. A 90% miner fork doesn't do anything if no exchanges accept the block ms they produce. They're mining a broken fork. They make it longer, but no one cares.

It's doing zero confirmations.  I could find out what node it's using and send them one transaction, then send another higher fee transaction to several other key nodes in the system which pays myself instead of them.

But miners would know. So certainly SOME would mine the one where they could actually sell coins. And the rest would have to follow. Remember, if the mining power dropped to 20% on the chain, it'd sill have a 50 min confirm rate, adjusted back to 10 if no one joined.

You didn't get scammed. He shorted you and didn't pay a miner fee. You can bump the fee with the right wallet software (just send it to another address with a  decent fee while unconfirmed; parent pays children). 
As for the $10 he shorted you? Meh. Asshole.

Zero fees, and yes, they make up for that with a 1% rate variation. It all works out in the end, especially with how volatile btc is. 
I can confirm that I've had my direct deposit sent to them for 6 months without a problem. Takes them one day after the direct deposit to send a transaction (Reasonable, a coinbase buy takes a week). 
They had the inevitable bank problem ONCE in the beginning, and had a couple day delay. They gave everyone $5 or so and explained the situation transparently. Us early adopters know the struggle they face, so I applaud them. 
They are a great intermediary for being paid in Bitcoin while we wait for employers to directly support it. Their business model is short lived (15 years?), but very solid.

A block size change cannot be implemented quickly. It requires 75% support (I think, might be 90, it's in the bip).  This takes months or even a year to happen. I don't remember how long the last change took...  It just hit 90 recently if I recall. We can't quickly force the entire network to upgrade.
If the blocksize becomes urgent by your definition, and we push a change AFTER its a problem, we will have to make it fork sooner than 90% causing a nasty fork, or wait for the 90%, after which time the effects may have already hurt adoption. 
We need a change in core now to help us later.

I know it seems like I jumped topic there but it connected in my mind. I apologize for the confusion, I hope I got you thinking. 
Could you expand on what types of mining tech would allow a pool to own 60% and not be a threat?  Is there an internal consensus happening?  Do they use proofs mathematically?  I'm honestly intrigued. I haven't dug into the mining side, nor looked at branches of code related to them. 
If I created a device that cost a consumer $100eu, and managed all Bitcoin related activity securely, AND mined independently (no gimmick). How would that sound?  No toaster bs, a true device marketed as a Bitcoin bank for your house. Full node, miner (weak, strength in numbers), blockchain API, wallet software, hardware wallet compatible, etc. 
For $100eu, that's barely over the cost of a trezor. Easily able to become a trendy item to own in Europe.  As people latch onto Bitcoin, they'd no doubt become excited to help secure the network and show it off. Hell, I could market "I secure the network" stickers with the product logo on it. 
Say we do that, with a zero trust operation, no gimmicks like 21 (just another mining pool). My product would operate more like a lottery, have a chance at winning 25BTC every 10 mins. Hell, even have a page to announce winners and show testimonies. Lol.

Yet if I have a use case where I desire to just reuse the same address over and over, and the recipient knows that I will do this, it working is **not** a coincidence, it is by design.  It's an ill-advised use case, but until forward/stealth addresses are widely supported, it is in use by many applications.
For instance, bitwage, changetip, and btcjam all save the address used for withdrawal to save you time in the future.  Bitwage actually repeatedly pays the same address with no option for an BIP44 pub key or forward addresses.  This is due to wallet support, and should be changing by the end of the year.
ArcBit released yesterday does a fantastic job of supporting forward addresses, and mycellium should be adding support soon.

This is just fundamentally not true. We are to discourage reuse - but not spread misunderstanding of a Bitcoin address.

The original block would be one deep now, with an empty block after it. The empty block doesn't need to be parsed to see what txs need removed because it's empty. In fact, it's entirely feasible for a miner to find a second empty block while the original is still being parsed. It's *very* improbable tho. At some point, the mempool is in a reconciled state and the next batch of txs can be chosen for the next block, and their hash is used in the block building.

The most spectacular thing about this comment is that I agree with you, but neither of us have a way to explain this conceptually to 21's core bitcoind fork devs. BUT WAIT. That's the spectacular part. Let them keep mining this way as a fee market develops and suddenly the incentive might be high enough for you and I to jump in and mine it ourselves.
Somehow, this truly free market keeps working. Honestly, I want a blocksize increase and some game theory on tx fees. But who knows where it's heading. 
My full node speaks for itself. It's crashed a couple times today, perhaps with mempool size issues?  Will figure it out and patch if needed. 
Bottom line: as a developer I say "go Bitcoin".

@_date: 2015-07-12 06:29:06
I'll take the time to answer this good question. 
When a new block is found, the only 100% guaranteed way to find a new block instantly is by including 0 transactions in the next block and just using the header of the freshly mined block to begin solving the next. (Block = hash(time, prev header, incl tx hash, txs))
This is because the miner must first download the entire new block and parse out every included transaction, independently verify it (some miners cheat here too), then remove the transactions in that block from the memory pool of transactions that they have. Only at that point (several or tens of seconds later), do they know which transactions will be valid for the next block and are able to reorganize a proper block. 
So in the time between the receiving of the block header (all they technically need) and the verification, parsing, and organization of the block header / removal from the mem pool  transactions spent, they choose to mine on an empty block.
This means a small chance of mining an empty block, but otherwise all their computing power doesn't know what to mine on and is idle. It's a free 25 btc to them if they find a block before the reorganization of the mempool is complete. 
Does that make sense?  It might require some knowledge and understanding of multithreaded/distributed computing and I'm happy to break it down in an analogy if that helps. Lmk. 
@_date: 2015-07-04 08:40:18
It depends on what he used to send it. If he used coinbase or xapo or circle, etc, his send address isn't really his. It would be the hot wallet address of that third party.

Reducing size doesn't help. Policy helps. Some guidance on policy in the reference code would be great. 
Right now, the reference code has a default limit of 700 or so (forgive my ignorance on exact). This is good guidance and proved easy enough for 21 to change it. Maybe some guidance on percent spam, spam detection, etc in the reference code will help. 
Can you code something up that might make that determination easier?  I know "spam" (0-fee, 0-block old, dust amt) has a limit. Maybe adding some easily changed constants here can help?  
@_date: 2015-07-04 08:35:35

I'm not familiar with this hash, but what would make it unable to be used for bitcoin is if you were able to somehow find 'difficult' hashes easier than by random nonce selection.

I understand the probability for the gamblers dilemma. I also understand averages. So I go back to my prior statement. 
When quoting the expected next block time do we want to be right an average of the time, or state fact. Fact is, we do not know when the next block is solved. On average though, it will be ten minutes since the last block. 
We cannot state "in ten minutes". We can not state "10% chance this minute". All we know is that we don't know. So the question remains, how is this EASILY explain to a user of the system?  :/
I'm not claiming to be right, I'm claiming that the averages wins the 10 min discussion. But it's moot. How do we as wallet engineers present the expected block times?  The only possible answer lies in third party risk analysis and merchants. They have to eat the double spend, and determine quickly how to handle it. 
Odds are, they'll end up charging 3% for the deal. Aaaaaaaaaaa. :)

The downvotes are from your lack of explaining. 
I think what you're pointing out is that them finishing  does not stop the attackers progress. He merely has to overtake them at some point. It could be at block  for all the protocol cares, he just has to get ahead of the chain anytime in the future.  The attacker could expend computing power to mine empty blocks, but unless he has the power of half the network, he will never beat the main chain.

Seems moot to me. 
If I am worried about space, I run a trimmed node. Still fully validated, just keep the last couple thousand blocks and the UTXOs. 
If I am worried about bandwidth, I turn off incoming connections (no sharing blocks with new nodes). 
If I'm worried about CPU energy spent validating blocks, then I'm really tight on the budget and should just SPV off someone. 
I don't see the "spam" that you're claiming exists as a problem. I see people that want to trade nickels and pay a fee. Understood that they don't HAVE to pay a fee, but miners are pretty good at optimizing the zero fee stuff. 
In the end, I don't see a problem with removing a blocksize limit altogether. The miners will need the fees given the halving - and to block that and instead tell consumers to tip more is just silly. The network can handle more than one megabyte per ten minutes.

But in wikipedia's case, they aren't providing a receive address for sending them money directly. They are using the payment API which provides a unique address for each donation, tagged internally at Coinbase with an identifier and donor info. Reusing this address would have an undefined outcome - most likely it'd be swept up by Coinbase.

Making up numbers here... If you have half a million dollars in stolen coins, I think it wouldn't be the end of the world if you lost 1/10 when they were stolen in transit. By that I mean, run them through the fog a tenth at a time, spread out over amounts and time appropriately.  Even if you ran them all through, ethically, they weren't yours anyhow. No honest loss...
Better yet, don't steal people's coins and you wouldn't have to worry about this in the first place. :/

From a security perspective, how do you feel about using a Trezor with a password, then having the root key (the "secret words") used to build the wallet stored ONLY in Shamir's Secret form (n of m) spread between trusted parties?  Maybe mix in another Shamir's Secret with the password used for the wallet. 
That's my current view of best security.  It's got the smallest attack vector, and greatest safe guards, ease of instant access, no untrusted third party, and not even a trusted third party with full access (including yourself if Trezor is lost). 
Strategically distributing the key is up to the user. I prefer 3 of 6 with me having simple access to 2 (home and work?), then 4 with friends and family whom don't ALL know each other and are a distance away. 
Recreating the key if need be, because of a lost/broken Trezor device, could be as simple as having one of the people I distributed a secret to texting me a pic of the QR, and me driving to the office.  Electrum can use the recreated key if another Trezor isn't handy, although I'd keep two, with one remaining uninitialized.

The kids enjoy the flexibility of Bitcoin.  I've given them their allowance in bitcoin for a year, and always offer cash OR bitcoin. I also act as an exchange for them at anytime, so long as they aren't swapping entire balance in and out of fiat.  Typically my 11 year old daughter buys things on amazon or itunes and my 14 year old son converts to xbox or itunes money.  They both also save too, and understand the diff between bank saving and btc blockchain saving. 
If we are out and they want something, I'll buy things for them with my debit card and they'll pay me in btc.  It acts as a peer to peer ledger between us in that respect.  It sure beats the old spreadsheet of kids allowance balance, or handling it all with bank transfers from their own account (they aren't old enough for a debit card).

But bank dollars and world of warcraft gold have legal authorities and personal identities attached.  So no matter who spends them, they're reversible under circumstances, and it's assumed the spender is the name on the account.

@_date: 2015-09-27 09:33:28
This is all correct, and there are a couple of solutions currently in development. Stealth addresses are one such solution. ArcBit supports these stealth addresses, but most other consumer wallets don't yet. 
For now, the best solution (avoiding address reuse) is to use a system such as mycelium gears to receive payment. Coinkite also has a good system as well. These systems require the use of an API to generate/track receive addresses, and thus require a developer to implement them. 
That said, for now, I would just keep the same receive address and change it occasionally. 
@_date: 2015-09-18 16:55:32
* Defense lawyers don't understand this stuff.
* They got caught exchanging it for fiat, attached to an identity.
* They got caught submitting transactions using the private key to stolen bitcoins.
* They took a plea bargain
I think that's where you'll see things start to get questioned - "Who broadcast the **transaction** to the network?"  That's where the identity of the spender comes from - not from who has the key.
@_date: 2015-04-04 00:23:26
There will be tools to help people do these things. It's inevitable.  Finding and partnering with replace-by-fee miners will become part of a game people attempt to use to double spend and take advantage of the instant payment trust that currently exists in limited form. 
I'm not looking forward to it, but it is inevitable. I just hope that replace by fee can be frowned upon and seen as a negative. There are arguments to the contrary though, I do realize that.

A promise with an identity linked to it, not a random number for whom you can't prove anyone doesn't have. 
Why are the bitcoins which I refer to as "mine", actually mine?  Even if you know that I have the key, you can't prove that someone else doesn't have the key also. You also can't prove that I didn't give someone a transaction that would spend those bitcoins. If that transaction get submitted, whose are they then? What if they go to a burn address? Now who owns them?

The sole purpose of the middle man in Bitcoin's case is fiat conversion. While your argument sounds fun to get behind, it's short-sighted. 
I have not used a middle man with Bitcoin when transferring value peer to peer. It's a fantastic ledger in that sense.

There is no mention of a *fee market* or limited blocksize. 
If you're relatively new, you may not have been exposed to this original design of the protocol. The block limit was put into place as a temp protective measure from spam (we have many more advanced methods for this now, miners are quite tech savvy). 
Bitcoin was originally architected to scale infinitely.

Volume had always been considered the replacement for the coinbase reward. These new notions of fee markets are silly. Already the transaction miner fee rewards are breaking .5 btc.

I'm unclear why you'd think that there wouldn't be a *mining market* whereby miners would set the min fee they take based on **profit**. More transactions doesn't cost them much to accept - the size problem has been rehashed over and over. No fee market is required under some arbitrary and crippling limit.

Ok, I'll give you that. We must consider the context though. Page 1, in the introduction it is written while discussing problems with the current financial network:


It also discusses merchants and Internet ecommerce as the primary users of the system. So we know that this system was envisioned to handle large volumes. 
Moving on, on page 4, concerns over disk space are addressed. This includes block pruning and (page 5) SPV wallets, theories at the time, but both of which exist now. The reason these were outlined is because it was known that size would be a possible concern. 
Finally, when satoshi committed the limit to the repo, volume was small and he specifically said that it was not intended to be permanent. We have devised numerous tactics for avoiding spam and to not remove this old limit is just foolish. 
By keeping the 1MB limit we are destroying the utility of Bitcoin if large scale adoption is the goal. Payment hubs and lightning channels are merely a level of regulation and are unnecessary (yet useful, don't get me wrong).

It doesn't *accidentally* work. The protocol allows it, explicitly. I can generate a transaction and send it to the network, sending outputs to a ripemd hash. The protocol has op codes specifically made to validate the signature of a tx, the hash of the pubkey, and ripemd the pubkey to validate a future spend of the transaction. This hash is the address of course. The Bitcoin language is primarily used with this operation, and it's rules, once again, do not accidentally allow address reuse - they explicitly allow it.

I have paid my 12 and 15 year old children their allowance in bitcoin for the past two years. 
My daughter is also an Amazon Prime owner (through me) so she gets free shipping and uses egifter to convert from bitcoin to Amazon gift cards (exact dollar amounts!).  She also uses me as an exchange and I'll instantly convert to USD either in person or by paying whoever she is with (grandma, mom, etc)
My son uses it for minecraft, domain names, xbox, steambitshop.com (steam games), and also pays others to do creative work or such - currency amongst them in their online world's. 
While they are now old enough for USD bank accounts, I feel that they have an edge up on their peers in the digital world, especially if either of them go the engineering route. 
Bitcoin solved two problems in our lives as well. 
I was away from the kids for 2 years and it allowed me to safely and securely give them spending money. Both had iPods (now iPhones) and initially used blockchain until breadwallet came along with its SPV goodness.  
It is a reliable store of value. For a child, cash is easily lost or forgotten. Piggy banks don't work well for storing the bits of money a kid comes across. They much prefer exchanging it with dad for bitcoin. Previously, they would trust their mother to hold cash and they quickly learned that mom isn't exactly financially sound - and their money would disappear or fall victim of "parental capital controls" as I like to call it. 
There's a lot more to the story and I've often thought of doing an interview of blog post with them. They've grown up using the blockchain with allowance, as a family ledger of value, playing games (simple board games we bet quarters on or such), and even Easter egg hunts that have private keys in them. 
It's been a great experience for them due to the problems in our lives that it solved. Not for everyone, but works great for us!!
@_date: 2015-11-05 13:28:53
Yeah. The more transactions there are with .0001 or .0005 or whatever is the accepted amount in consensus with the miners. It varies with size and age of inputs as well. There is a formula to calculate it. Either way, 10k tx * .0005 = 5 BTC. That's doable. Just need the blocksize to be unlimited - as originally designed. BIP 101 is the best approach (and live)

In your analogy, 21.co is selling a horse with a really nifty toolset for the horse. The horse also poops a couple pennies per day. This horse costs 10x the cost of a normal horse up front, and eats a lot more food (more expensive to operate, costing more than he poops out in pennies)
They also offer the really nifty toolset for free, to use on your normal horse (which doesn't poop pennies, but also doesn't eat all that extra food). 
What is innovative here?  Seriously, you're comparing this to a SLR or digital photography breakthroughs?  It's a python library on a raspberry pi, with an old miner that costs more to run than it mines.

If the demand is massive and infinite, why do we need a fee market. People pay small fees already today, and if there are massive amounts of people doing that, the miner fees will far exceed the block reward.

There is already a block header broadcast branch in testing which drastically reduces the size of the new block.  In addition, they can validate WHILE they mine. We've already seen that some miners don't validate at all, which is fine my me. That reinforces the need for full nodes. Let the miners SPV mine at their own risk.

The offline wallet you use will manage your keys using an HD wallet and generate new addresses for you, never reusing them. Don't focus on an individual address - they're for one time use. Your wallet software has a master key it uses to generate infinite numbers of addresses - and it can regenerate them all from a simple 15 or 24 word phrase that it will provide you on first use. THAT is your master key. Don't trouble yourself thinking that you have to manage or record individual addresses.

I agree, the "hassle of learning it" that I was referring to was the whole dialup, internet, ISP, windows side. Many had to be slowly convinced through better interfaces and smoother UX to use it. It was a combination of smoother UX and accepting the "hassle" for the benefit. 
Of course with Bitcoin the value aspect makes it frightening for many, and rightfully so. This is where products with multisig and forced mnemonic backups are helping. Even the hosted solutions are acceptable in some cases. While not "pure", they're acceptable entry points for some consumers.

With child pays for parent, the receiver can spend the stuck transaction to themselves with a higher fee. This incentivizes the miners to mine the parent (original) transaction because without it they can't include the child (higher fee) transaction. 
This is a much better way of handling stuck transactions as it introduces only a change to miner policy and can't alter the receiver.  Some pools already do this.

It's not three fucking pennies - it's not a fiat amount at all.  I think you're referring to .0001 which is hard coded in many wallets and in the OP's case for a $100,000 USD valued Bitcoin, would be worth $10 USD.  I believe that's why he's asking the question, to which the proper answer has been provided - the fee will adjust itself within wallet software and miners programmatically or manually to maintain a reasonable rate.  Because it's in the best interest of the entire network to keep it reasonable.

But miners must remain profitable. So they won't mine zero fees, and will set their own limits to which transactions they will accept with 2 things in mind : profit and competition. 
Ultimately, he who has the cheapest electricity and most power efficient hardware has the advantage. 
Competition means that a couple miners can't collude to raise the min fee because another miner will hop in and mine them to get the fees if they can do so profitably, and there is nothing that the other miners can do to prevent him. 
This limit to blocksize destroys the benefit to the consumer - lowest transaction fees to remain profitable. To ignore that is to ignore page 1 of the whitepaper.

You can always find the private keys yourself from any of the seeds. They use HD as written in BIP32, are standardized words via BIP39, and some wallets structure the HD path via the standard in BIP44. 
Breadwallet uses m/0'/0/c/k for its derivation path (c is 0 or 1 for change address, k is key)
Trezor uses m/44'/0'/0'/a/c/k for its derivation path (a is account)
**the point I'm trying to make is that your seed backup is "m". You can always derive all paths yourself using the right tool**. I've written a tool to do this but don't want to spam a link. 
Breadwallet was developed before the bip44 spec, and doesn't support multiple accounts. That's why the path isn't bip44 standard.

Someone consolidated a whole bunch of inputs into a couple of addresses. This isn't uncommon at all. Typically such a transaction would be created by a merchant, merchant service provider (ex bitpay) or exchange (ex coinbase)  to scoop up all of the deposit money and move it to a cold storage wallet. 
This is akin to receiving a ton of cash transaction throughout the day, then making a single deposit into your bank accounts, some in savings, some in checking, maybe even use a bit to pay a third party. 
Again, this isn't uncommon at all - and is just be someone consolidating a ton of receive addresses. I'm on a mobile or I'd dig deeper with blockseer, but unless you have some reason to suspect something of interest here, it's frankly not that interesting. :)

It's really disappointing to see you take a hard stance on something easily made configurable and changeable throughout the lifetime of the application.  Typically us devs pick a preference, but leave things open to the user with the understanding that personal preferences and use cases may vary.
I reviewed all iOS wallets last week and bread was the fav except for 3 problems: high tx fee, no touch id, and bits being forced.  You're now oh so close - but I'm sorry - my 60 year old parents just get annoyed when they see all of the 0's.  Actually, I do too.  As an engineer - it's meaningless.
What you're doing is preparing user preferences for where things may be in 5 years instead of helping adoption now.  I would think we'd be better off helping immediate adoption, then dealing with a precision switch later.  Certainly switching units of measure since their currency has **deflated** isn't going to piss anyone off too bad.

I have a send transaction that's been **pending for 4 hours**, so I've been looking around at the support site.  Why exactly would they have a send transaction in pending for any time at all?  They have not broadcast it to the network - at all.  It's not showing on my node, blockchain.info, or in the wallet I sent it to (bread wallet on iOS).
I could easily think of some conspiracy theories here, but does anyone have any simple reason this might happen?  I've used coinbase as an exchange for nearly a year now and have never had a delay when sending to on-chain addresses.
[This is the details of the transaction on their site.](
[This is a link to the not-yet-existing transaction on blockchain.info.](
I always thought that verbage was included just to gloss over the details of block creation times.  It's clear now that they are queuing up transaction for some reason.  This means that their wallet is not instant broadcasting transactions?!  Has anyone else experienced this?  
Could coinbase be.... down?!?

Good call, you'd have won.

You're confusing what the problem is. Monetary policy and value are two different things. 
At the heart of this you're also missing what he is saying. He's saying that we don't want a government to "adopt" it because there is no such thing. He wants people to adopt it. Screw the government.

Today I noticed that ChangeTip was also using mBTC.  After digging into their preferences I found this setting:   I like that concept - allow it to automatically flip to bits when the precision is needed.

Use  for direct deposit to the blockchain. 
Use Neteller and egifter for spending. 
I do this now with a portion of my paycheck. I'm at the point where traditional banking scares me.

What turned you into blockchain.info, and what made you believe it is secure? It is a very common way to lose Bitcoin and I'm genuinely curious how newbies keep ending up there. 
Breadwallet on iPhone
Mycelium on android
Armory for offline PC
Trezor for hardware

Excellent - this is exactly what I was looking for.  Any idea if someone has addressed the fact that the root user has an unknown password in Raspbian?
@_date: 2015-02-26 01:34:19
No. Wallets will never do that. You're totally missing the point of decentralization and the bitcoin network. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 01:29:55
No, it didn't.

a good example is greenaddress, which published a tool on github for recovering funds using the nlocktime'd transaction that they give you for your multisig wallet every time your balance changes.

Explain why a fee market is needed. I've never heard an argument that takes miner profitability and competition into account.

But the trailing 3 zeros have practically no value currently. How does it help adoption if I have to have this conversation (over and over and over):
*So how much does a coffee cost?*
***Maybe ten thousand bits.  That's about $2.50 usd.*** 
*THOUSAND? Why don't they just drop the thousand part?*
Consumers are used to xxx.xx. mBit handles this nicely. I don't understand your stance. Guide me to discussions on forums maybe?  I can't get over forcing this on users.

It is guaranteed to work in this case. He is using a BIP32 HD wallet. 
@_date: 2015-02-13 06:21:03
I was referring to a paper HD wallet. Not a paper address. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 13:11:37
What are you referring to?
@_date: 2015-02-11 12:01:28
The op would **not** have to create a new paper wallet every time he spends coins. The wallet is used to sign any transaction from a set of addresses, of any amount. 
A signed transaction on the other hand is locked to an amount, thus the huge difference in maintaining that solution.

This is parallel to extending the visa network with gift cards. 
@_date: 2015-10-03 22:14:29
Agreed. 
@_date: 2015-10-22 06:06:22
So the backend systems don't have to scan an ever increasing number of addresses?  I can elaborate, but it makes sense from a system design perspective.

The fee will adjust itself within wallet software and miners programmatically or manually to maintain a reasonable rate.  It's in the best interest of the entire network to keep it reasonable.

It doesn't sound that unlikely. Hasn't someone warned you about blockchain.info wallets?  Not sure why you have a wallet there but it's been bad forever. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 01:41:27


Can you name another iOS wallet that uses "bits" exclusively or by default?  I haven't found one yet.
- greenaddress - mBTC (allows change to uBTC)
- Coinbase - BTC
- Copay BETA - mBTC (allows change to bits)
- Blockchain - BTC (allows change to uBTC)
- Hive - BTC
Copay is the only other that even calls it "bits".

See my comment.  That's all I was doing, transferring to bread wallet - over 4 hours ago...

Yet adding the risk of losing your coins if Coinbase OR your personal key is lost. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 23:22:04
I understand your passion for this. It may be your downfall of you don't provide a simple obscure setting for this. Don't pick such a silly hill to die on. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 14:30:18
Imitation is both a form of flattery and confirmation that you got something right. 
Why do you think that the others haven't made the change like you did?  Especially Coinbase - it has the largest consumer footprint. 
Do you understand that the position with regards to denomination is subjective by nature, but the security features which you've mentioned can be approached objectively?  I wouldn't be so quick to compare them.
@_date: 2015-02-23 00:01:11
Where can I find the consensus and discussion that you continue to reference? Bitcointalk.org? Have any links handy?
@_date: 2015-02-22 01:47:41
None did.  You said that you'd take bet.  That means that you'd bet the other side, agreeing to a bet.  A bet you'd have lost, because none had (or have) integrated.

If I had a sign outside encouraging people to store bricks in my house, I wouldn't ask everyone where they got the bricks, and where they were taking them when they picked them up. 
Your relating it to boxes storing unknown items isn't the same. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 23:47:27
Credit is not required for those things. In fact, if banks and even society didn't push early purchases on people and encouraged saving instead, people would be less a slave to the banks (but of course banks don't like this!). 
Personally, I'm not a slave, and I saved for my nice things.

The same two decimals that you don't display unless used (financial applications will always explicitly display the .00)?  
Also, the world is not comfortable with only displaying a single decimal place just because the second decimal place is a zero.  Currently your application drops the trailing zero (ex: receive 10 satoshi)- you might want to file this away as a bug given your thought pattern on this two decimal place adoption.
Hats off to you sir, while I adamantly disagree with your stance and I'll continue my search for wallet nirvana, good job on the app dev.  I do hate seeing dev stubborn elitism/dictatorship philosophy stunt user flexibility tho :(.
