The fact that you think those statements are self-contradicting indicate that you did not understand the argument. 
If we account for everything in the manner suggested in Charlie Lee's post, there is absolutely no incentive to do X. But there is often a qualitative benefit Y, not captured in Lee's model. Lee's model requires that the sender of a transaction shoulder all the costs for X, whereas this post is pointing out that people often carry out X to achieve other goals, and don't mind if the sender attaches lower fees than the actual true cost to the network.
I didn't read the rest of your wall of text. You are probably vehemently agreeing with the post, but because you did not understand it, your post opens up with snark and negativity.

The one big advantage of SegWit is that it fixes transaction malleability.
But we can fix transaction malleability just as effectively by computing the transaction hash in a way that skips over the malleable signatures.
There. Done. 90% of segwit's positive impact captured with a 10-line change that requires no change to miners or clients.

I don't get the hype around Enigma. SMC is not actually feasible today. There are some constructions that work for toy examples, but you can't really do SMC, with or without a blockchain. And the paper leaves undefined the entire technique for distributing the SMC. So, you're going to stuff SMC code into a Bitcoin transaction?

@_date: 2015-12-30 14:10:22


Good. You're unqualified to read and comment the rest of the article.
First, an increase schedule of 0 is still an agreed upon increase schedule. The post calls for agreement, and presents a protocol for consensus between two divided chains. It's a pretty good idea if there really is a fork.
Second, if you actually read the developer forums, *everyone*, including the major miners, major exchanges, Adam Back, Greg Maxwell, and almost everyone else at Blockstream have already publicly voiced their support for *some* increase schedule. Like a late convert, you're more extreme than most developers.
Finally, the attitude of assholery you display does not reflect well on the community. Like a Tumblerina, it looks like you were incapable of reading anyway, and were looking for an excuse to get offended and give up.  
@_date: 2015-12-30 15:16:24
So you support NO AGREEMENT, and therefore a fork of XT??? Supporting altcoins is not allowed in this subreddit.
I know that this is not what you meant to say, but your reading comprehension failure is still ongoing. An agreed upon "increase schedule" of 0 bytes is still an agreement. If you object to AGREEMENT, then you're a supporter of forks. And a buffoon.

Indeed, I ended up getting into a protracted argument with him. The **part he did not read in the article is actually in bold**. He thinks that if only a majority of miners were to make a new chain, and couple it with a bunch of easy-to-thwart attacks, they could change any part of the protocol and the full nodes will just have to accept it. Why? Because reasons. Or, because it's a long chain on an shitty altcoin. As if a shitty altcoin with a long chain is a hard thing to make.

Before LN, it was sidechains that were going to help Bitcoin scale. It turned out that sidechains actually never worked in a trustless fashion.

So, you keep telling me what rational people would do, over the course of 4 comments, in response to my comment that said "people are innumerate, and therefore not rational" as if your responses are some kind of rebuttal. You also keep repeating "this conversation is weird." 
If you indeed do not assume that people are not rational, then there is no point in telling me, repeatedly, what a rational actor would do. It just doesn't matter. People see the larger pool, and flock to it. End of story. 
So, you're right, this conversation is weird because you're slow and daft.

Do you know what happened to Bitcoin when a miner exceeded the 50% threshold? Do you know how many times that happened? Do you know how to go back and check Bitcoin history with facts that can back, or more likely, completely rebut, your claims?


You need to learn about 2P-POW and Non-Outsourceable Puzzles then.

The problem with all of the current devs, especially the ones you mentioned, are that (a) they are themselves mired in conflicts of interest, (b) they have highly skewed viewpoints, and (c) they are not very good at either business or research. Talk to any of the devs, and you get a highly skewed sense of prior work that doesn't go back any further than 2009. And a forward-looking vision that is highly torqued towards their pet projects. And the pet projects turn out to be either non-sensical or dead ends.
@_date: 2016-01-02 16:28:58


To be fair, we need competing implementations of LN. 
But you are absolutely right: the entire crew at a16z seems out of touch with the cutting edge of research and development in Bitcoin. Which is odd because they are clearly monomaniacal Bitcoin fans. So they love the tech, but lack any understanding of what's happening at the forefront. Which would be quite normal for 99% of the population, *except they are VCs and are supposed to know better*.
Also, a16z took a huge misstep by not hiring any of the Bitcoin core devs at their companies, and letting almost all of the devs get employed by one company. That kind of centralization of interests is not good for anyone.

While that's true for each individual decision, once a critical mass is reached, the sensible thing to do is to join the large team. And initially, there will be uncertainty about who as joined. So, like many tragedies of the commons, it involves decisions made under uncertain conditions, with everyone doing what seems sensible for them, while having to ignore the big picture. So one can hardly blame anyone for this.

There are two quantitative benefits to consider.
1. The benefit of joining a 26% pool versus a 23% pool. The gains to be had from lower variance and fewer orphans are so small that there is little practical reason for a miner to prefer the bigger pool. (Though the 26% could perform selfish mining, so that's a concern, but let's assume that they choose not to). 
2. The *perceived* difference between the two pools. Most people are innumerate. They have no idea what the difference is. So they play it safe and prefer the bigger pools.
In other words, "rational self interest" arguments don't work when people are innumerate and don't follow rational decision-making. In fact, they can obstinately choose the "irrational" path.

Yeah, but you are assuming that there are vast differences between users. Whereas some of us believe that people's needs from a payment system are roughly comparable. In which case, jstolfi's analysis is right on: there will be a dive to the bottom, with everyone spending more on overhead, but nobody will be better off. This can drive people away from Bitcoin.

Look, it's simple: either we exchange representations of value, or the good itself. Does your coin facilitate gold transfers across the internet, where physical gold is sent and downloaded? If not, it trades representational tokens. And that's what colored coins are.
