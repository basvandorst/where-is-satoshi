His misspelled core.
It's called Bitcoin Legacy.

Wirex outsources every part of their platform..   
If Wirex support fails try "CONTIS" and see if you get any where. 
They lost my business when they did their IEO on OKex and on their own platform with different prices and lockups.

Similar to Binance as a benchmark

Haha "multi-kill" !! 
Yet another great twitter feed to leave on screen for the day.

Dude exited the market and has a reward to show from it.
It'll depreciate like shit but hats off to him.

Really?

Save and upvoted! How do I give gold
@_date: 2019-11-17 23:32:57
Think of local bitcoins with bank transfer only and a better interface
@_date: 2019-08-20 17:58:11

welcome to the new world

They have automated systems to deal with KYC instances at large scale.
Something else is afloat

Can we not bring Australians into this.
This piece of shit does not represent us
@_date: 2019-10-19 13:48:47
Have emailed you.

Instant GBP deposits and fair fees.
No minimums it limits
@_date: 2019-10-19 17:52:05
Users are lazy and either don't read or save their deposit addresses instead of confirming each time.
You could say less privacy sure, but any exchanges with KYC requirements are going to comply with government KYC/aml standards before BTC maximalist privacy advocacy.
@_date: 2019-06-23 08:12:24
Www.getfifo.io for GBPsterling.
No holding coins or lockup's
@_date: 2019-10-09 12:35:26
For banking go Llyod's. By far the best we've had experience with towards crypto and crypto conversion.
Www.getfifo.io for a U.K. based fiat on-ramp that can also do your payments if you wish.
@_date: 2019-12-22 14:59:29
So don't go to jail...
Or get caught.
Perhaps 2x safes at two different houses instead?
Depends on your paranoid level
@_date: 2019-12-20 16:08:18
KYC on wallets is harsh.
KYC on exchanges seems to be accepted.
EU law is putting both businesses into the same basket as holding or transmitting crypto's.
If they had the funds they would shift their business, IP and operations to a more friendly jurisdiction.

ATMs are priced at a 12% markup, how is this good advice?
@_date: 2019-12-24 16:07:40
Long as you liberal with your seed key and happy to restore to default occasionally... 
It's the pain of being self sovereign with your wealth.
Just imagine the stress doing it for other people and businesses

I find XRP app getting loads of updates and needing a refresh recently.
Glad you made it in the end
@_date: 2019-12-24 16:17:03
Me too.
Love collecting revenue from defi
@_date: 2019-12-22 10:25:52
If you want to get crazy secure
@_date: 2019-12-24 12:30:03
Have you got access to another machine to try with? 
Even try potentially interacting with your ledger via a DeFi platform or MEW to check if it's the ledger or the app? 
Sounds like the LIVE app is at fault
@_date: 2019-12-24 12:34:35
Any firewall software on your PC blocking elements of the app? 
Yesterday I noticed snow falling as an Xmas surprise on the live app..
Maybe the Xmas update/surprise is trolling your machine
@_date: 2019-12-24 10:24:50
What are they offering thats better than an exchange that can afford a .com domain?
@_date: 2019-12-21 21:12:36
Cut the seed in two and use two different safe deposit boxes
@_date: 2019-04-21 08:29:40
Take a bitcoin deposit straight to an exchange and flip some of the proceeds into fiat
@_date: 2019-12-21 21:11:34
@_date: 2019-04-14 20:39:28
So true

Anyone investing in this space also knows all the bullshit too

Have a look at coinmarketcap for full listings of all the currencies.
They have links to all the different Wallets.
I’m not holding BTC currently as I’m building a tracker Fund of the Top 30coins to HODL 
@_date: 2017-09-20 10:23:11
What are you doing with bitcoin? Spending or Holding?
Are you looking at the desktop or mobile version? 
Longer term holding should go to a paper/offline wallet
Spending and general use can be on a mobile / desktop wallet of your choosing. Plenty of open source wallets out there to choose from.
Never give away you private key.

No one is being scammed.
Everyone knows the difference on what they are buying. 
These articles are yet another waste of people's time trying to learn more and better themselves.

Speculating on price doesn't require that bitcoin balance to be backed.
Your settling in cash. Usd or GBP... not BTC
@_date: 2019-05-06 22:55:59
Man knows
@_date: 2019-05-03 22:51:57
