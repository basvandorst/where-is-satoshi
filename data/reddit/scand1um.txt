Just to share my experience - i stored a very small amount of btc ($5) in a crypto exchange site and i tried finding the site a few months ago only to learn it's no longer around. No clue what happened to it. 
I'd keep it in a private hardware wallet personally.

I've been out of the loop for a couple years... I have a bitcoin file (wallet.dat i think it's called) in a flash drive with just a few dollars on it. I used to just cut/paste that from/to my computer's wallet. 
Does this not work anymore? I found out the btc wallet i used to use is like 100gigs taking forever to update. Is there a way to access my btc wallet file without this huge program?

Except when people say it's used by criminals, they more so mean that it's one of the only ways it's widely used as an actual currency. Besides illegal things, not many people actually uses cryptos as a currency.
