what a luck!
I also have won a lot of these in the past but was to lazy to cash out the price. Some Nigerian guy is also emailing me constantly, nagging about sending me huge pile of dollars. Don't need it, I'm cool :)

~~Yoda~~ Me said that the ~~Dark Side of the Force~~ BCC is not stronger than ~~the Light Side of the Force~~ BTC, he said that it was merely "quicker, easier, more seductive".

I'm not seeing any benefit in smartphone POW.
Industry barely keeps up the battery time at about 24 hours, performance is lagging a long time because insufficient battery. Maybe PoS would be better suited for mobile phones.

miners have put insane amounts of money into asics and made insane amount of profit. For them the best would be to stop development on bitcoin. Network is growing, we'll just make another 10.000 asics, problem solved.

when i sold at previous corrections, I always lost. Cannot beat the market, so i'll just HODL

if you can't trade the dip, HODL or you'll loose

NO, I'd never outlaw them. ICO's are a fantastic opportunity for a lot of innovative projects that would never get funded in classic world.
BUT, when investing, people should lecture themselves and understand the risk that it implies (win a lot / loose all). That is a healthy economic environment, some will win and unfortunately some will loose.
If some are willing to throw money to a PDF document, than be it!

Just in case somebody comes up with the idea of using shopawl ... don't do it.
Ordered on 15-th of may 2017 with shopawl, payment with BTC was confirmed and blockchain.info link was sent to them many times.
Since then i sometimes write them on facebook, just to ask about the status of my order.
After 4 months of "we will check" and "wait let me check" replys, I must confirm them as a scam.
I DO NOT ADVICE ANYONE to use their service.
EDIT on 07 sept 2017.
Shopawl contacted me via facebook in minutes from my negative review and apologized for loosing my order.
Also I should have confirmed my payment on their website with the bitcoin transaction ID and mark it as paid.
They offered to refund my bitcoin or to process my order, i choose to process my old order.
Because since 15-th of april and today bitcoin had a huge price difference, they offered me to spend the difference on other products. I did that.
Now my orders are processed and based on their info a part of the goods is already heading towards me.
I'll keep this post updated when I have new information.
Based on last contact info they are a legit business and I'll make soon another order from banggood through shopawl.

I don't agree with "Go fuck yourself" drama, he may have another opinion and it's OK, we must respect it.
The more important is to put a Replay Protection on 2x chain.
Bitcoin grew much bigger to let it be mostly influenced by a bunch of nerds in Core and cyberpunks. Marketcap is inviting guys with suits to "help us". Miners who by definition must be greedy feel the urge to "control it". Many might feel, we are left out of this.
There are not 3 legs in bitcoin, there are 4: devs, business, miners AND USERS!
So yes, install your 0.15.0 full node and write to every 2x business if you don't want it.
And we should press 2x to enable replay protection to let people decide.
Unfortunately Bitcoin Cash was just a grand rehearsal for more disruptive things to come.

at least we can show support for the Core project. The more nodes online, the more "moral support" for the NO2X bitcoin.
Let's do it, let's at least show how much of us disagree the fork.
