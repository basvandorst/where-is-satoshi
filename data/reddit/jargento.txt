You only pay taxes on the profit. If you didn’t profit you don’t pay taxes. But you still need to report the transaction. Basic shit man.

Let’s fucking go!!!
@_date: 2019-10-15 20:18:25
Just buy. If your goal is really long term then there is no reason to wait.

Well just going by the rule if you don’t want to dump money into an extremely high risk investment if you are 5 years from retiring. When you are early in the investment game, then your, say, 2k that you lost won’t hurt as much as if you invested a shit ton in.

To be honest for fraud reasons. I highly doubt it.

You need to use a real banking debit card. If you really worried about your credit card and personal bank account. Open a random bank account with Wells Fargo or Bank of America strictly for trading.

Yeah so throw whatever you’re comfortable with. When bitcoin drops a little that means it’s on sale and you’ll get a quick return. My average purchase value on bitcoin is about 9800. I throw 100 bucks every 2 weeks into my bitcoin wallet. I wait til it’s under 10k to purchase.

I wouldn’t tell my dad who is 57 with 400k in his 401k to invest in bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-02 21:44:31
No. I know my number is completely random. My point is that the closer you are to retirement. You don’t really want to mess with it.
@_date: 2019-09-02 22:44:56
Lol. You said you’re stupid. Hahaha fucking retard.

There was a lawsuit in regards to the irs. Look it up.
@_date: 2019-09-02 21:33:03
Correct Coinbase lost a lawsuit against the Supreme Court so they are required to release everyone who purchased on Coinbases info to the IRS. main thing to remember Coinbase is an exchange. Technically if they go bankrupt you will lose everything. So get a wallet. Like a trezor. I’m getting one once i hit 10% of a bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-02 22:39:26
You understand completely what I meant by that. Thanks though for trying to sounds smart.
@_date: 2019-09-02 21:25:23
Well how old are you?  If you’re under 30 then yes. It’s smart to invest 10% of your income to bitcoin. Another 10% into savings and if your job has a 401k maximize whatever they match. But don’t invest more than you are willing to lose. My personal goal is to reach 1 bitcoin then just start investing in stocks and other more conservative options.
@_date: 2019-09-08 15:48:51
NOOOOOOOO you can’t.
@_date: 2019-09-08 05:31:50
I’m not sure. I buy all my coins from Coinbase then immediately transfer to my wallet.
