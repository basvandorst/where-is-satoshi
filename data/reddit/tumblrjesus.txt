The more I learn about Bitcoin, the more I want to learn. There isn't much opportunity for me to use Bitcoin at my day job, but I want to start working on something, just so I'll be prepared if/when the mass adoption comes around.

I'm new to bitcoin, trying to learn a little more every day. It is great that we can see the network's statistics in realtime, warts and all.

I really can't wait until sidechains get worked out and implemented in a reliable fashion. Seems like there's quite a few scaling and performance hurdles that could be bypassed with parallel chains in this fashion.

Is there any particular technical reason you say this, or just because you saw it as an unsustainable investment vehicle? I'm not flinging shit, just asking, because it seems like nobody really has any clue what the market will do for any of these cryptocurrencies at any given time.

Why? Shouldn't we be using the Blockchain MORE so we can prove its worth? If game developers start using the Blockchain as a web service for rewards, that becomes a valuable service and common currency across all platforms.

I wouldn't say *every* platform, but that's besides the point. I'm just saying that people sometimes get wrapped up in hype and hope and make ridiculous claims that can sometimes make the rest of the community look silly by comparison.

The ground is still being firmed up with infrastructure and code developments. This is more important than just price, in my opinion. Doesn't worry me at all, we'll be the ones owning coins and having the knowledge once the masses figure out the benefits of cryptocurrency.

My girlfriend asked what the charts were that I was always checking, and I gave a quick overview of what BTC is. She asked how many I had, and I explained none, I'm just waiting for a good time to buy. Well, she surprised me at Christmas with money earmarked specifically for me to buy some bitcoin. 
She just asked "what's the price up to" and I had to explain that it's actually down quite a bit. It's now kind of quiet in here.

I have to agree with this. I've had people sold on Bitcoin when describing the technology, but lost them when they look at the price swings. Bitcoin could take a lesson from Tide detergent. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 16:47:43
Exactly! No matter what happens to "the price", the technology is still there, and just as viable as ever. I'll be happy when the speculators vacate and we can focus on the important things.

Ugh, this certainly doesn't smell good. If one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges can't get its security right, what does that say for the rest of us? Granted, an exchange's wallet is a much bigger target than a personal one, but I thought this sort of stuff was impenetrable... backed by math and all of that stuff.

Is going full node really the answer, or should we be looking into the possibility of a server/terminal clustered relationship? I can see a lot of interesting implementations happening from developers, but keeping a 26GB and growing ledger alive on all devices that want to play seems wrong. In the Bitcoin house of the future, I could see having one "Bitcoin box" in the basement, churning away and tracking changes, and client nodes communicating with that. Not that the network itself doesn't need more nodes, that's for sure, I'm just saying I'd love to see more in the way of thin clients.

The good news is that Gates has obviously done his homework, and knows about Bitcoin and The Blockchain. It's on his radar, but as it is right now, isn't a full solution the way he envisions it. It would be incredibly naive to think that Bitcoin is perfect right out the gate, and expect Bill Gates to say "Bitcoin is the new dollar", drop the mic, and walk out while the price skyrockets to $5B/coin. 
A lot of web technology wasn't really ready for prime time until a few years ago when asynchronous web programming became a mature and established thing. 
I'm just happy we're in the right ballpark.

Am I missing something more significant in the demo than just... a progress bar that moves a little bit every time you click a button? 
@_date: 2015-01-08 13:31:35
Gee, guess it's time to buy some more bitcoins!!

Does losing thousands of dollars on Mtgox and Bitstamp count as having an authentic Bitcoin experiences? Because if so... I'm fine with watching from the sidelines.

I explain that it's like playing Monopoly, but instead of a banker, everyone just keeps track of what's happening on the BoardChain.

Whenever someone from has pointed out a "buttcoin troll", I've never found their comments to be all that far off-base or inflamatory. I mean, it hurts when they're gloating over a setback or price dive, but when someone challenges what you believe in, that's a good opportunity to prove them wrong. The Buttcoiners love to point out that the Blockchain isn't capable of functioning at the same speed and scale as a typical credit card payment processor, and they will continue to bring it up as long as people in here make claims about Bitcoin world domination. 
This all reminds me of the early days of Linux. Some people downloaded ISOs and tried out new features, some people wrote device drivers and utilities, and some people just hung out on slashdot posting about how Linux was going to kill off Microsoft any day now. 
Obviously, there are trolls who just love to get under people's skin, but most of the "obvious trolling" I've seen has been from fairly educated people asking challenging questions, or trying to point out just how unreasonable some people's claims and predictions are.

You wouldn't EVER use Windows on a supercomputer. Supercomputers are architected to perform a specific style of operation as fast as possible. Simulating nuclear decay, sifting through geological data looking for oil deposits, analyzing financial records looking for trends or fraudulent patterns.  You don't saddle them down with a general-purpose operating system.

Not the article I was expecting, and glad it wasn't. 
Blockchain is *interesting*. I'm looking forward to seeing more people make use of its benefits in the future. But if you think it can possibly replace the systems that run the world's banking, insurance, healthcare, decisions support, payment AND financial management systems, then you have no idea what happens in these real-world lines of business. 
In a typical Fortune 500 datacenter, you'll see mainframes. Lots of them. They're working in a decentralized fashion, and it works for them because they did it the hard way, basically enabling multiple physical boxes to mind-meld with each other across what's called a Parallel Sysplex. To go further, they make sure they don't step on each others toes with something called a Coupling Facility, but more importantly, have been engineered with commerce in mind right from the beginning, literally over 50 years ago. If you're interested in business technology on a massive scale, look into it. 
I work with a few of these systems on a daily basis for my job, and they're quite amazing. Yeah, call me a banker shill or whatever because I work in the financial sector, but I'm genuinely interested (and as of a few weeks ago, invested in) Blockchain technology on a smaller scale. 
The Blockchain goes about solving the issue of distributing a ledger by letting its nodes do their own work, and then agreeing on one big transaction to add to the blockchain afterwards. You can take it one more step, and say that exchanges that operate "off the blockchain" are adding one more layer of abstraction, doing their own transactions, and wrapping those up into node-level transactions, which then get folded up into the blockchain. 
It's not wrong, it's not bad, it's just not ever going to scale up to the level of what Visa does in realtime. Where it could absolutely disrupt is in person-to-person payments. Sending money back home, paying for services online, crowdfunding efforts. Stuff that doesn't have to happen in realtime. Of course, there's still the problem of an ever-growing blockchain, which is for another discussion. But the overall model would absolutely work today if the value hadn't become such a sticking point. I'd absolutely accept Bitcoins as payment for freelance work I do on the side if I knew that it'd be worth the same in USD three weeks down the line. It's the rise and fall in price that has hampered real-world adoption in my opinion. Maybe if 1BTC were pegged to the price of a 150oz jug of Tide :)

I'm a fan of Bitcoin, but I'm not a fan of losing money. Cashed out this morning, but plan on re-investing once I get a feeling we're on more solid ground. Right now, it just feels like the floor has given out, and I don't see any real reason for the price to go back up any time soon. 
Sorry, not trying to be a jerk or a downer, just trying to play it smart and move that money into other investments for the time being.

I'm happy that this will make it easier (and hopefully a little less sketchy) to jump in and out of the market. Not sure what it says about Bitcoin as a platform, overall, though. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 04:28:13
I wasn't aware of this. Sorry, I'm new to bitcoin and haven't seen this written about in my exploring.
@_date: 2015-01-07 00:54:27
What payment processor do they go through? I'd be curious to know how much they're actually benefitting from Blockchain technology, and/or benefitting the community.

Excellent writeup! I'm really glad you did this, it's been hard to find actual facts and citations in the rest of the posts currently on the frontpage.
