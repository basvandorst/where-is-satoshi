I would say the same thing. That is the whole point of this methodology. You don't know if it will keep going down and if it does, you should have faith for the price to go up seeing as you bought it in the first place.  The point is that when you buy some Bitcoin or even common stocks, you only have limited downside potential (Bitcoin going to zero meaning you lose everything you put in) but you have unlimited upside potential (Bitcoin going "to the moon"). If you believe in the potential of Bitcoin and the price seems reasonable at current levels then you should buy "at the market". If you don't think it has potential then you shouldn't buy it anyway. 
If Bitcoin kept going down then it doesn't matter because you bought Bitcoin on the basis that you think the price will go up. When it does, the momentary loss between when Bitcoin kept going down below your market price will still be insignificant to would could occur if the price increases. It's just a small price to pay to make sure you bought in at all. 
It's always better to just buy in if you believe the price is fair instead of trying to time the "most optimal" buying point.

This stresses an important point that it's always best to just buy at whatever the current price is rather than setting your order lower in the hopes you can get it for cheaper.  It's another bad case of trying to time and beat the market. 
The small amount of money you save initially is irrelevant compared to the amount you could potentially miss out on if you don't buy in at all. 
Just look at the last big dip when some people had orders at 3000 when they could have bought at 3050. Those people missed out on the most recent bull run, all in the hopes of saving a really tiny amount of money.

This is their shtick.  I've seen articles and posts from these guys before. They incessantly post or reply to themselves with pictures of their family and their children to push their agenda. I don't for a second take anything they say at face value. While it seems they didn't purposefully advertise scams, they just as easily could have been doing it knowingly. It is unfortunate but also easy to see why the Government did this just as you outline in your post.

Here's a question relevant to the scarcity of Bitcoin.
Why on Earth would anyone use Bitcoin as a currency when it is inherently deflationary by nature due to it's scarcity? Why spend Bitcoin when the price is just going to go "to the moon"?

I don't think you know what you are talking about.

I was replying like that to OP since he's made several posts in this sub just asking for Bitcoin price predictions without contributing anything else.  He's just interested in making a quick profit but he has no idea how to actually go about doing it, hence why he is hoping r/Bitcoin can somehow make him rich.

TIL a small price drop that occurred on something as volatile as Bitcoin after one of the most incredible 24 hour surges in its history is a crash.

If you're using the term "market cap" to talk about Bitcoin like this you clearly have no idea what you are talking about.

The charts prove that it will go to $6000 during the weekend so you should definitely buy in now if you haven't already :)
