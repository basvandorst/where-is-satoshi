The miners have to find a hash of the block containing all the new transactions that has a certain number of leading 0s.  They do this by taking the block of transactions, adding a random seed to it and hashing it to see what the result is.  If it doesn't contain the correct number of leading 0s, change the random seed and try again.
The first miner to find a hash of the block that contains the correct number of leading 0s is rewarded with a certain number of bitcoins (currently 10 or something I think) and that block is then added to the blockchain and all the other miners verify it by checking that the hash is correct.

Could a legal contract not be made that said "I the plumber will receive 1 BTC in return for 3 hours plumbing work."
In just the same way that a contract could be made that said he would do the work in exchange for a Ford Focus?

This seems to have been fixed - bitcoin addresses now being recognised as actually being valid addresses again.
Whether withdrawals will actually happen who knows, but they're at least accepting requests for them now!

Someone correct me if I'm wrong but wouldn't a backup just give him access to the address with 0BTC in it after they had been sent to another address by the person who broke in?

He's saying that if he is somewhere where a shop accepts USD but the goods are priced in some other local currency then the refund will be given in the local currency that the goods are priced in.
He is then saying that if a store accepted USD but the goods are priced in BTC then the refund should be given in BTC as that is the currency the goods are priced in.
Thus it follows that if the stored accepted BTC but the goods were priced in USD that any refund would be given in USD.

Ah, so would this normally be implemented through your site or whatever generating the addresses for the customer using some kind of method for keeping track of offsets?
Or would it be a case of you publish the public key and just let people use it?  Direct them in some way?
Am I right in thinking that if you were doing it on your side of things and generating it from the MPK for them then you may as well just generate new addresses for them in the normal way or is the "normal" way something that is really hard to automate?

Yeh, a single address is only really useful for somewhere with a small number of transactions, well in fact, I suppose only ever 1 at a time.  Or at least any that are similarly timed would have to be for very different amounts.  Somewhere selling motorvehicles would have no difficulty if they sold 5L of engine oil to someone for £5 at the same time as they sold a car to someone for £15k.
I never considered the whole privacy element to it before coming into this thread though.
Ah that's pretty cool that you can publish a master key that lets people generate new addresses.  I'd seen master public key in Bitcoin clients but hadn't known what it was, nor that it was what was referenced by MPK.  
How does it ensure that no two people generate the same address?
I'm going to go have to do a wee bit of reading up on the idea and how it works now.  I'm imagining it's fairly simply executed.
I don't think it's something I would ever have a use for.  I certainly can't see one but I suppose there could be some day.

Do you have a link to any of Satoshi's writings about reusing addresses?  I would love to have a read of his thoughts about why it's a bad thing.

You can create a new wallet on, say, blockchain.info and instead of using it to generate new addresses, import the decrypted private key then send the bitcoin balance from that address to one of your own that you control within one of your own wallets.

A car was a bad example I suppose, something like providing carpentry services in return for plumbing services would probably be more similar in that it would be difficult to prove either way.  In fact in that case the bitcoin would probably be better because at least there is concrete evidence that you can TRY to get the judge to look at.
I guess in Bitcoin related cases you would really be hoping for a tech-savvy judge so that he can review the evidence properly.

More a good reason to always check that the address you're telling someone to pay to is the correct one.
@_date: 2014-02-04 02:55:33
Would the blockchain not be admissable as evidence?  Surely they are using evidence from it at some point during Mt Gox trials, Silk Road trials?  Would this imply that information from the blockchain could be used in court to prove payment?  Would just showing that you had sent money to an address be enough for the court to order the exchange to reveal the name of the person who had cashed out that bitcoin balance?
Otherwise I suppose you would just have the signed contract with their Bitcoin address which would make it harder for them to argue it wasn't theirs?
IANAL so I am interested in the opinions of someone who is.

Yup, his fault.
"He points to the QR code on the front of the register and says "send your payment to this wallet". I did."
Yup, you did.  He told you to send it there and you did, you shouldn't be liable at all for the loss since you paid the address he asked you to pay.  
Sucks.
