Oh I fall into his trap. But still I like his thinking... wouldn't be bad if we take over the world. I like changes :) That said,.... to the moon! :D
@_date: 2014-11-11 13:32:15
Moin moin.
@_date: 2014-11-11 13:34:39
Can I also install two wallets? One in this cold storage and one for daily use with small amounts on it?
@_date: 2014-11-11 13:02:20
Thank you for the extra infos. I will research about this alternative. The whole subject is as if I would just have discovered the internet one day ago lol. Pretty much to discover and to learn.
@_date: 2014-11-10 01:03:22
Oh yes :) Lots of material! Watched already a video about Bitcoin :) I think it will take me some days to go through all other informations I got here, Thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2014-11-11 12:29:55
Thanks for the welcome :)
@_date: 2014-11-11 13:50:12
By the way, your efforts to accuse people with stupid stuff lead to nothing. You seem to be very paranoid. Improve your perception please.
@_date: 2014-11-11 06:08:58
Haha, thank you :)
@_date: 2014-11-09 18:38:55
Thank you! Will keep me busy!
@_date: 2014-11-11 17:17:48


This! I agree and that's my point and my experience. First of all I want to say too... heats-off, the community concists of a lot of helpful people but sadly there are also those who come up with what you said. I got that several times now too and you see it all over the place that some people think newbies come because of the tips. It's funny when you don't ask for tips, but you get them, and later some people think you came for the tips. Very strange.
@_date: 2014-11-10 15:45:23
Haha, very true. It's good that we can save discussions here on Reddit. I think this thread will be my hub for some time because all of the informations :D Thanks for helping!
@_date: 2014-11-09 21:48:48
Yes Germany here. Thank you. This thread will be bookmarked for a while... lots of informations! Didn't expect that much help! Awesome forum here!
@_date: 2014-11-10 18:58:04
Danke dir :)
@_date: 2014-11-09 22:45:55
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-11-09 21:45:12
I could imagine that too but first I will go through all informations that I got here. There is a lot to learn I guess.
@_date: 2014-11-09 12:13:49
Is this new payment provider or what?
@_date: 2014-11-10 18:06:26
So, in theory this means if everyone uses Bitcoin, the smaller units would increase in value and could become the commonly used unit?
@_date: 2014-11-10 08:27:59
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-11-10 21:51:55
First, I am still used to it that namecalling is forbidden in several forums and online games and other places. And I understand the reason because it can open doors for harassment. Second, if someone disagrees with one of my PM's and calls a couple of people to write me a PM, I wouldn't like this either.
Some people here told me that it's not forbidden on Reddit but I'm not sure if this only applies for this sub or for Reddit in general. Don't want to wake up tommorow with a ban. :)
I still dislike the idea, no matter how stupid the PM is that I got. Btw. one of the mods of this sub got the name and checked the username. You can find the discussion here in the comments. There are some tiny details about the user.
@_date: 2014-11-11 16:14:56






I sympathise with you too. I am sorry for you. :)
@_date: 2014-11-10 14:50:50
Yep, also I think he just loves trolling. He should get a life.
@_date: 2014-11-10 10:51:54
Danke dir. Das wurde hier paar mal erwähnt :) Trotzdem danke :) Ich bin erstaunt wie hilfsbereit die Leute hier im Forum sind. Super cool.
@_date: 2014-11-28 19:26:51
This is gentlemen!
@_date: 2014-11-12 07:11:25
Thank you.
@_date: 2014-11-10 08:57:50
No, didn't came through but no problem :) So many tipped already
@_date: 2014-11-09 19:40:05
Thanks for the welcome and advise. I'll be careful. I think I know this from other internet forums.. there is sadly no place without scammers and trolls. Thanks for the welcome :)
@_date: 2014-11-10 17:50:55
Aber die Käufe danach gehen dann schneller?
@_date: 2014-11-10 19:48:36
To be honest, when I got links suggested yesterday with informations about Bitcoin... banks and governments were a topic too in some videos and articles. Could it be that banks really pay people to troll here as Bitcoin seems to be a big threat to them?
@_date: 2014-11-11 06:24:01
Thank you.
@_date: 2014-11-09 18:04:34
Thank you. I think I need to read about this.
@_date: 2014-11-11 09:47:03
Didn't go through the whole channel yet but I will do this as the one video was interesting. But I got so much good links to read and watch that I am still very busy to go through all of it :) I think it was the beginner video that I watched but I must take a look, if not, I'll check it out!
@_date: 2014-11-10 21:30:33
I saw a video yesterday that someone suggested me too, it was the Bitcoin 101 on YouTube and the author did mention it as well that it's an experiment also that the price can go up and down. With my current knowledge I take this with me and follow the topic on this way. Anyway, I would like to see it go mainstream. Just imagined that I pay my taxi after a party with my smartphone "peeeep". :D I saw this Berlin Kreutzberg documentary yesterday too, there is a whole district accepting Bitcoin. This is quite cool.
@_date: 2014-11-11 14:04:42
That is cool. I will research about all this too then :)
@_date: 2014-11-09 22:58:14
But even that sounds like a low fee to me anyhow.
@_date: 2014-11-09 23:04:45
I love magic! Thanks for the tip :)
@_date: 2014-11-10 21:10:27
Ok thanks for the advise. Still lot of things to learn :)
@_date: 2014-11-10 18:16:18
So, that means on tuesday you go out and spread love in other subs? This sounds cool! That's how I arrived here, because someone tipped me :)
@_date: 2014-11-10 00:44:45
This comes right in time as I am newcomer :) I got already lots of informations in this community and the list is long... but this video is very interesting.
@_date: 2014-11-10 08:48:15
Thanks for the coffee :)
@_date: 2014-11-11 17:18:59
Yes this is very true.
@_date: 2014-11-10 20:45:40
I promise,... no elaborate scheme :D Althought this sounds funny.
@_date: 2014-11-10 18:55:44
More people should follow him.
@_date: 2014-11-10 00:33:21
what does multi-sig mean?
@_date: 2014-11-10 11:39:14
I was asking how much it would cost me if I send for example 1 USD with Bitcoin to another person that can get Bitcoin too. (Althought I do think I first must create one address anywhere, but I still read about this)
@_date: 2014-11-11 10:12:19
Hi there, I am OP of the post you linked. I can asure you I neither know the guy who tipped these glory amounts or the OP here who just copied a part of my title either by chance or because he saw that my post got popular. But I don't want to allege that, it's probably rather by chance.
@_date: 2014-11-11 11:04:58
Can you explain what he means with moon? I am new here.
@_date: 2014-11-10 10:48:01
I pay the coffee back. :) Don't tip everything away :) But I can try now too... $2 @_date: 2014-11-16 13:50:50
Does that mean I shouldn't buy before it goes below $50 or so? Sorry for the dumb question but I am new. So, you mean the actual price is scam?
@_date: 2014-11-11 10:35:20
Today when I logged in and saw a post that was called "Is this real money?" I just thought "Ok, now some will think that it is me too but with another account" because the headline is one part of the title I used when I opened my thread. I don't want to allege that OP, it could also be pure chance, but it definitely came to my mind that it will make some people think that there is a pattern. And it happened, someone then meant to have found a connection between the glory person who tips $17 tips to newbies, the OP with the title and me. Fun fact, I neither know the kind tipper or the OP with the very similar title. :D
But I understand what you mean and I agree, it's just sad that I'v been accuses to be member of some tipping ring or so in another thread lol. I pretty much can imagine that if this tip rain happens on newbie threads regularly, that some people make a business out of it. This is the sad side of the internet and absolutely scam, yes.
@_date: 2014-11-09 18:41:58
Thank you! I'll check it out. :) Are there more ways to earn them?
@_date: 2014-11-11 10:00:51
I didn't came here to collect tips, they just were literary thrown at me when my thread got attention. I just created the thread to say hello and to ask about Bitcoin and got a lot of help. I tried to reply to all people who came up with useful informations. I simply didn't expect any tips as I didn't even know at that day if it's just somekind of Reddit feature until I learned it's more than that.
@_date: 2014-11-10 10:57:00
With the word real I wanted to express my cluelessness yesterday. It's just that I got this tip and thought "What is this? Is this some kind of Reddit playmoney?". However, after I got so much informations here and after reading a lot, I start to understand that it's not just a Reddit feature :)
@_date: 2014-11-11 09:48:27
Oh, and I am not from Berlin. Just saw this Bitcoin Berlin documentary, which is why I mentioned Kreutzberg. I am from Hamburg. :)
@_date: 2014-11-10 00:47:18
OK thank you but this sounds like more advanced information. I think I first read all the other informations I got her but I bookmark the video you posted too :) Thanks.
@_date: 2014-11-09 23:19:11
I believe that too. I feel as if I went into a library and got buried under a bookshelf :D So much informations... there is no way that I can go through everything today. I think it will keep me entertained for days :) Thank you for the tip :)
@_date: 2014-11-10 19:45:04
Afraid that Reddit would ban me. I guess this is not allowed to show usernames.
@_date: 2014-11-09 20:32:40
Oh, since I am now here too... I welcome you :D
@_date: 2014-11-11 10:04:09
Thank you for mentioning this. I will a little attacked by this thread here too. I didn't came here for tips, I introduced myself and asked what Bitcoin is and if it has real value... got tons of replies and help, I am thankful. Sure, I also got tips but did I ask for it? I rather asked if my first tip that I received that day would be something like real money or a Reddit feature lol.
@_date: 2014-11-10 15:30:35
Yes please. You have desert near you.. go play there. It helps us both.
@_date: 2014-11-11 13:25:30
Because it happened I guess. Not sure how you can see it but your tool does a great job :) I can PM you the full discussion if you like. It happened in my very first post here on Someone stopped by to tell me nothing else than that I am dumb, arrogant, wrong and an idiot. He told me that he could find that out based on my comment history. I fed the troll and released my thoughts about him. To be honest, if someone starts his computer to insult people without reason, he/she doesn't deserve another way of discussion. But that is my depressive way to handle such situations (yes I suffer from it) and this is also the reason why I am highly at risk to show my other side.
I am open minded and friendly most of the time but if someone tries to get me into a bad mood, it will happen immediately. I don't control that, it's my depressive side.
@_date: 2014-11-10 18:19:10
This makes sense. Thank you!
@_date: 2014-11-09 18:20:59
wow :D thank you
@_date: 2014-12-07 07:05:55
Agree with what you said. We shouldn't put all people under general suspicion. 300 bits
@_date: 2014-11-09 22:47:21
Thanks for the tip and for the welcome!
@_date: 2014-11-10 19:49:20
No, this is a privatemessage. Not public. That's why I blacked out the name.
@_date: 2014-11-10 11:23:59
Sorry for the late reply. Having a hard time to reply too all the answers and informations I got here :) I watched the documentary. Very exciting technology. I like the point they make with the banks!
@_date: 2014-11-09 19:19:52
Thank you Mike!
@_date: 2014-11-10 10:49:53
I love beer :D Thanks!
@_date: 2014-11-09 21:56:48
I am totally amazed with this community here already. I now really need to read up on it. I am very curious now. Thank you!
@_date: 2014-11-10 10:54:19
Thank you. I have read a lot yesterday and I now start to understand. I got so much informations here. I hope this currency becomes very popular. I am very excited.
@_date: 2014-11-11 06:23:15
Thank you for the tip!
@_date: 2014-11-16 17:36:20
You're not right
@_date: 2014-11-11 11:10:17
I share 500 bits with you :)
@_date: 2014-11-11 09:54:06
I am one of the newbies. Didn't expect to get tipped. Wanted to say hello and wanted to know what the heck Bitcoin and reddit tips are. Got a lot of answers and I am thankful and surprised how much help I received in my thread. This was actually so much that I still couldn't manage to go through every link but I am working on it :) Didn't came here for tips, I just got them, I didn't even expect it.
@_date: 2014-11-09 20:31:08
Wow! Thank you but that's crazy! :D
@_date: 2014-11-10 20:58:43


This sounds so good. It's good if a community can also discuss about weak points, no matter if true or not, it's good to discuss things. I've been part of all kind of forums with different topics. Some communities can do this, some not. I always prefered the ones where critism is allowed no matter if it's positive or negative critism. A nice discussion can actually be very healthy. I saw people talking with game developers about game changes for example. In some places it is allowed, in others negative critism would be deleted and so on. Discussions are just healthy in my opinion
Agree so much... let me try to give a tip. $1 hope this worked.
@_date: 2014-11-09 18:38:05
A good list, I will go through it!
@_date: 2014-11-16 14:26:44
Experience. Never had this happen. They take care of their sites and ads.
@_date: 2014-11-11 13:35:39
Then I hope I didn't inspire them :)
@_date: 2014-11-11 18:02:04
Don't get me in trouble :) Thank you!
@_date: 2014-11-16 13:53:22
Here is the German voice version: 
@_date: 2014-11-10 21:08:33
If that is scam, then it is very good scam :D Thank you!
@_date: 2014-11-09 21:49:51
Thank you so much.
@_date: 2014-11-10 15:05:34
Your life is very sad. You should end it.
@_date: 2014-12-07 07:17:57
Please, let it be true. 5000 bits
@_date: 2014-11-09 21:45:31
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-11-11 18:07:37
Ok thank you for explaining. But he makes some points that I would like to happen. I would be ok with it if we are the new 1% :D Let's take over the world.
@_date: 2014-11-10 11:00:02
Thank you. I was cluelessness yesterday when I got my first tip and thougt it would be some kind of "reddit playmoney feature" but then I started this thread here and got so many replies with useful informations. I start to understand that it's not a feature or playmoney. Thanks for the tip! Anyway, I have read until I got tired and today is a new day and I read more now because this is very interesting!
@_date: 2014-11-10 14:57:30
That is a pretty high fee. It's 4% for a transaction? So when I send 100 USD in bitcoin, the system will take 4 USD of it and the other side just gets 96 USD in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-11-10 09:05:42
Thank you! This one worked. Also good to know for me so that I know how tipping works :)
@_date: 2014-11-10 15:00:20
Thank you. I'll feed you troll. But please promise me that you go kill yourself soon.
@_date: 2014-11-10 18:09:38
Cool, someone suggested another video of this guy yesterday and I liked it. Explained a lot. And thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2014-11-10 15:41:03
I saved the whole thread here because I got so many useful informations. I notice that my question about the transaction might already be related to more advanced knowledge that could confuse me... I think I will go through this once I understood the basics of bitcoin. Learned a lot yesterday but it's so complex and I think I should go through it in a sequence. I visited bitcoin.org already and have read a lot there. Still not completely through.. so, thank you. This seems to be one of the most suggested site and I like their FAQ. :) I will also read about transactions but that later when I know more.
@_date: 2014-11-09 18:20:18
I am from Germany. I am very excited that this is possible o.O Also thanks for the tip. I am not sure how to say thank you. I'm confused and excited. I opened up Google right now to find out more. Is there any site you would suggest to read?
@_date: 2014-11-10 19:43:19
Haha, fun fact... I got a video suggested yesterday where the author also talked about some points of this PM. I'd say this video came right in time :D
@_date: 2014-11-11 10:10:18
No, he tipped me too, he can`t be the OP. But the OP here copied a part of my post as it it seems. This stinks like copyright infrigment. :P
@_date: 2014-12-27 15:45:04
Even if we are still not there, I hope we will arrive there.
@_date: 2014-11-09 19:15:32
That sounds enchanting :D
@_date: 2014-11-10 20:21:50
I'll do that but I must say after reading several articles and watching all kind of videos yesterday, I really think that Bitcoin is quite interesting as a technology but it will probably have a lot of enemies. I will follow the whole topic, I will be careful, I also got some strange links via PM yesterday and of course offers to spend my tip amounts on strange websites. I didn't click those links. It seems that this community has it's blacksheeps as most communities. After browing through the sub I also see some decent bitcoin fans and some very agressive bitcoin fans. I definitely won't believe everything here but it doesn't look as if Bitcoin would be scam. I even found all kind of mainstream articles on the issue. I think your suggestion is good.. listen everywhere and build an own opinion... that's what I will do. :) But this PM didn't convince to stop reading about Bitcoin :D
@_date: 2014-11-10 15:36:34
This is still a little bit complex to understand I think. Maybe I should learn about this later after I understand the basics :) However, if it's not percent, then it's actually not that bad. I just thought that 4% is a lot but if it doesn't apply to all transactions, it's not bad. I think that people won't transfer 1$ often. And 4 cent of $100 is not much.. then it seems like it is not much of a problem.
@_date: 2014-11-11 19:16:13
Thanks for the welcome :)
@_date: 2014-11-09 19:10:46
I will check the freebits forum out :) Also thanks for the other informations :) I am very excited that I got so much help here. Friendly people!
@_date: 2014-11-09 21:47:16
Thanks a lot for the links. I'll go through all of them... many informations here in the thread. Will keep me very busy I think!
@_date: 2014-11-10 19:56:12
That was my first thought.
@_date: 2014-11-11 12:37:20
I love Humble Bundle. I usually bought there with Paypal but I will test this with bitcoin soon then too. Yes a phone app would be cool too, I saw these apps in a documentary yesterday. But at the moment it is really as if I am burried under a bookshelf :D I really need to sort all the informations I got. I think bitcoin is very complex.
@_date: 2014-11-10 11:02:21
I just wanted to express my cluelessness with the word money. I just got my first tip yesterday outside of this Bitcoin forum and the link to Bitcoin forums... I now thought it would be some kind of Reddit feature like playmoney, like karma or upvotes. But siince there was an USD sign in the tip, I was confused and asked the question here. I'm happy that so many people replied with useful informations :) Good community here!
@_date: 2014-11-09 21:43:37
Thank you, I will take a look but first I need to learn more. Got a lot to watch and read here.
@_date: 2014-11-11 13:29:02
Thank you very much!
@_date: 2014-12-27 15:43:56
It's massive what our community can do. Really massive.
@_date: 2014-11-11 10:25:31
Very kind of you :)
@_date: 2014-11-10 15:03:11
Still not dead? Sad.
@_date: 2014-11-11 11:15:55
Thanks for the explanation. :)
@_date: 2014-11-11 13:40:29
Looks more interesting if you see the full discussion :)
Now think about it again. Where do you have your silly strategies from? Here in Germany we have media channels that use the same strategy. Showing only what they want to portrait but leaving out facts.
Get out and breathe some fresh air :)
@_date: 2014-11-10 08:44:12
Thank you, I got these links already, they are good! I was reading yesterday until my eyes hurted :) Also, yes I collected the tips. My first tip was collected outside of this subreddit when someone tipped me the $1... which is why I came here to ask what it is :) Thanks for your help!
@_date: 2014-11-10 08:35:34
Thank you! 
@_date: 2014-11-10 18:29:04
So, I don't get it... what is now better? I just installed Electrum but then this can be hacked on my computer... is Coinbase better for a beginner like me? I just need to be careful which links I click then?
@_date: 2014-11-09 21:46:13
Hmmm tasty :) Thanks!
@_date: 2014-11-10 10:48:48
I think it is much better to mention the amount. I will do this on this way in the future. :D
@_date: 2014-11-11 06:10:54
Thank you :D
@_date: 2014-11-10 11:03:56
Oh wow :D Ok thanks :D
@_date: 2014-11-11 12:26:52
Both. I made already a few test tips but I also forwarded an amount to a wallet to find out how this all works. Someone suggested me to install Electrum. I managed to send something to an address that the tool created. I googled where I can spend it and found some things out. I am gamer and Humble Bundle seems to support Bitcoin. Now I just need to feature out how I can pay with my wallet if I shop online. Didn't try it yet, too afraid, I must read more. If this works well, I might also exchange some smaller amounts of my money that is left over by the end of a month to Bitcoin but that is future music I guess. However, after reading about the Bitcoin concept, it is probably the best idea to not spend too much of it. If I exchange euro to bitcoin, then I will see it as investment. In some youtube videos they said that it could be much more worth if this technology becomes popular. I might split my Bitcoin amounts up and save some and spend some.
Before I do all this I must feature out better ways. I dislike the idea to have money saved in a tool on my pc. While Electrum was easy to set up, it's probably not so secure. Imagine my computer is defect and the money is gone. I have read here about a coinwallet that is online. I guess this is better but I must find the comment where it was mentioned. I will then use that if it's legit.
@_date: 2014-11-11 17:14:21
Adoption only works if the newbies stay. I am newbie since two days here and got tipped like crazy in my first post and when I look around the second day, I find all kind of allegations that are totally crazy. I for example got a 50k tip and this friendly person seems to tip all newbies that much as I learned. Then there are people who now think he owns my account and the account of other newbies and accuse him that he only wants to trigger a tip-rain on "his accounts" lol. This is crazy and just one story you can find here.
EDIT: typo
@_date: 2014-11-10 21:54:20
Nope. He isn't. It's another user.
@_date: 2014-11-10 08:29:07
That is cool! Subscribed!
@_date: 2014-11-10 18:21:39
This explains why some people tipped me with different units. Very confusing for a beginner..
@_date: 2014-11-11 07:28:27
What does he/she mean? We are in cahoots together? That's fun. I am the OP of the other thread. I neither know you or the OP of this thread here lol. But it looks as if the OP of this thread here just copied a part of my title lol :D

That's funny :D

Mors, Mors :) I could imagine that we have a community in Hamburg, I will probably find out, but at the moment I am too shy for this anyway. I prefer reading and watching videos now and build up some more knowledge and then let's see :) 
That is interesting with Uber. Hope this comes true :) It would be cool in general if this comes true everywhere. It's not very unlikely to get robbed in Hamburg and if all I have is a smartphone and the criminals don't know how to use Bitcoin, this would be amazing. I wonder if I could control my bitcoin in this case from my home computer? If so, it would be so cool.

Thank you. I will stay. Here are also a lot of friendly people :)
@_date: 2014-11-10 11:26:31
But what exactly is the fee? Are there any informations? I mean if I start a transaction, how much will it cost me?
@_date: 2014-11-11 11:34:32
Much appreciated! Thank you! :)

I received one of these huge tips too in my newbie thread.


It is actually more ridiculous and like a parody if you sit in front of your computer, introduced yourself recently to a new community, got burried under tips, to find out later that people think you're a sockpuppet. Very amusing. :)
We can make a deal to show you how paranoid you are. Write the glory tip giver and invite him and me into somekind of chat room. Maybe you can even invite some more accused people. But I forgot, if you see us in a chat room to find out that not everyone is a sockpuppet, your next explanation will probably be that we are some kind of african child workers that sit in a room to grab some Bitcoin for their drug lords.
To be honest, it's very amusing. I sit here in my room in Germany and get a big tip of a stranger and one day later I read your post. This makes me realize quite fast that the Bitcoin community has clearly some muppets in the ranks.
Seriously, I have seen what 50k bits are worth. While it's a very good tip when we consider that a stranger tipped me that amount (much appreciated stranger!), I simply must tell you that it's a tiny amount of the money I get by the end of the month by working for a German company. Seriously, do you really think that someone would perform those contortions you meantion, to animate other to tip too? Tips that are not even worth a fraction of the money you can earn with a fulltime job in Germany?
Please, get out and get some air. Your are totally disillusioned by Bitcoin.
Where are you living that you think all newbies would be part of some scam ring or would need to rely on a bunch of bits? If there is something hilarious than it's your conspiracy.

Are you guys rich or what? 
@_date: 2015-04-03 11:46:45
To be honest, I am always online. 24/7

Yes the name of the steamgifts site is very confusing. It's in fact rather a lottery but created by the users that frequent there. It's kinda cool to offer or join steam giveaways there. But yes, the systems works somewhat like a lottery...
1. User created giveaways
2. Other users can join
3. Dice roll and winner gets the stuff
The whole design and the features there are great. I guess this would work really well for Bitcoin too.

I tried to find the PM but it seems it's not visible anymore as I reported the user and message. :/
@_date: 2015-03-13 20:25:15
Thank you!
@_date: 2015-03-04 22:39:22
I am sorry for you. It's not your fault, it's about your genetics.
@_date: 2015-03-13 20:06:34
1. No, but I came here via Twitter retweet now
2. I will check out your site to find out
3. Can not say yet.
@_date: 2015-03-15 23:11:34
I think there are 500k users. Not sure where I got this from though.
@_date: 2015-03-04 08:41:35
Exactly... it's somewhat hilarious. :)

@_date: 2015-03-03 21:48:14
Got the exact same link just with another message but also about nudes bla bla.
@_date: 2015-03-15 23:10:59
I wondered too because I always thought there would be just 500k users.
@_date: 2015-03-03 21:44:32
I have trouble to find the message now. Could it be that I can't see the message anymore as I reported the message to Reddit?
@_date: 2015-03-07 20:13:11
I guess I am too late as always?
@_date: 2015-03-03 16:58:32
What is this crown sourcing or kick starter for bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-03-03 16:56:02
The blender foundation should be on that list: 
Blender is one really awesome and free 3d tool. It always has been a free tool. They do also accept Bitcoin donations.

I support this idea, and I would tip too, if I would be wealthy lol.
@_date: 2015-03-07 20:19:11
haha, cool
@_date: 2015-02-02 15:18:07
I think I should tip more often too but I am not that wealthy, so, it's difficult. When I made small tips a while ago, people offended me because they are small :/
