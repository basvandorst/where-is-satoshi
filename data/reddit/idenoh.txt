No offense, but I'm going to look for relationship advice from someone who doesn't assume the majority of women are too simpleminded to understand this very basic concept, or someone who doesn't assassinate gspots.

Also, if you have an android phone with google wallet set up on that you get a receipt on your phone within seconds.

I used my google wallet card a good six times today.
its easy to load the money in (from another bank account), there isn't any extra fee's to use it, and it works pretty much anywhere. Pretty cool service altogether, like a prepaid gift card for everywhere.

okay, I get that, a lot of people are entirely satisfied with iOS 7, many people are upset over superficial bullshit like they don't care for the way it looks.
But that doesn't change the fact that there are underlying issues within iOS 7 which is affecting a massive number of people. Wifi being greyed out on pretty much any and all model at random times, that cannot be fixed. the phone randomly setting a passcode or changing your passcode, this requires a wipe, thats if you can get the phone to stay in recovery mode long enough to restore it.
or how about the people who decided they couldn't stand iOS 7 and went to a different mobile OS, if they forgot to turn off imessage, they are likely not going to be receiving any sms from iPhone users for a while. These are major issues, and not simple quirks. Sure, I see the worst of things, but that doesn't mean that these very big issues; and that isn't even the worst of it.

I want tasker like functionality, I want to be able to use NFC for *whatever* I want. I want the ability to receive vcards via bluetooth. I want a safe mode to help troubleshoot software issues. I want the ability to install applications via a web gui. these are pretty simple things and funny enough, things I've ran into this week alone.
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:09:48
Ignorance must be bliss, just because you're too simple minded to see the possible applications everyone else is the crazy ones? Have fun with that.

What an idiot. The reason people "aren't" spending bitcoins like they spend fiat is because the services and products people want are only just NOW becoming available via bitcoin. I've personally used my bitcoins so far on gyft to purchase movie tickets and other specialty shop gyft cards, and that is amazing. When the services come, so will the transactions.
This article is fud no matter how you slice it.

yeah, bullshit. I work in Applecare tech support. I can say without a doubt how atrocious iOS 7 is compared to the newest version of android. we get new issues nearly every week related to latent issues with the new OS that its not even funny anymore, its downright frustrating as shit.
Apple made good stuff, they did. for a long time too, not recently. Nothing in the 5S is worth buying over the 5, let alone the nexus 5; Except maybe the camera.
And just a tip? Just because you personally couldn't give two shits about how a device is, doesn't mean you are anywhere near the standard when it comes to the average apple customer, I get at least 5 calls a day MINIMUM from people asking why they can't do something "Why can't my $600 iPhone do this, my friends shitty android phone can!".
In fact its SO bad with iOS 7 that we have customers leaving in droves to competition, even the blackberry z10 is looking like a decent alternative to an iPhone 4/4s running iOS 7, do you know how terrible that is? That phone is downright rubbish.
And for the record, this whole Jaded tech user bullshit you're throwing around doesn't make you seem mature, it makes you seem like a teenager trying on dads suit to look impressive. You might be older, but you're acting like a 12 year old.

Oh my god I got out of mining at the exact right moment. The *second* I saw the last jump I went ahead and put my units up on ebay for a $80 profit per unit over the price I paid for them, and now I'm turning that money into straight bitcoins over a period of time. This is freaking insane!
@_date: 2013-11-09 05:34:08
AHHHHH I hate myself for squandering my early bitcoins, I had a over 1000 of them  back in 2009, mined and just...wasted them. I'm glad you were able to  make off well with your investment, I still love bitcoins and fully support it, can't wait to see where this goes!

Tasker is an application that is able to control every aspect of the phone.
For instance, I use it with NFC tags to put my phone into "driving" mode by tapping my phone against my dashboard. I put it into "home" mode when I tap my phone against the wireless charging pad on my desk. I can set up a profile that will detect when I'm at work and mute my phone, turn off wifi, and auto reply to phone calls saying I am working. 
I know that I'm not the standard user, but that doesn't freaking matter, I simply cannot use an iPhone because they refuse to give me the ABILITY to do these things. Just because not everyone would use these, I can't? and its not like apple would need to do anything other than allow the user to do these changes.  Hell, you can't even use basic themes on your phone without a jailbreak. 
As for the vcards, since my moms phone was asking her for an iCloud account that didn't exist anymore, and we couldn't remove it, and because Apple removed the ability to sync contacts, calendars, and notes via iTunes  within mavericks we were unable to sync her contacts back to her phone after a restore. I thought MAYBE the phone could receive the vcard via bluetooth from her old android phone, since, well...its a piece of shit android phone from 2011...low and behold...Its not supported.

@_date: 2013-12-10 08:15:30
You're missing my point though. Yes, the original iPhone was indeed a great phone, but it was missing features that were included in nearly every single phone out at that point, they didn't include them because they deemed them not needed. Pinch to zoom was not an apple invention, it was included in other commercial products as early as 2003, however apple did it best first. Yes, I *want* competition, I don't want a company that copies everything that works, I want an Apple that does things that noone else is doing and finding the best way to do it, why should I settle for a platform that takes a year to catch up to the competition?
@_date: 2013-11-06 02:30:56
That is actually less than what others are selling them for. 350+ per on the BID, not even for buy it now
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:56:29
but thats the problem, apple is so fucking behind on what the people want that they wait nearly a year or two after another OS has run that exact same functionality because its successful, they're reactive, not proactive. And if you think they're doing anything more than trying to keep up with the curve, consider the fact that the original iPhone did not include a camera, it wasn't until the 3G that the iPhone had the ability to send MMS, a feature every single other basic phone had. In fact, pretty much every single major feature on the phone happened because of competitive pressure. Android had their own version of quick settings as of october of last year, and I'm fairly certain that webOS had something similar about 3 years ago. Apple is a reactive company.
do I want apple to give up? hell fucking no, then I wouldn't have a job. Do I want them to go back to taking risks and actually innovating for a change? fucking yes, we need less reactionary copypasta bullshit, and more innovation.
But that doesn't change the fact that there are other major issues, I seriously hope you run into any of them, or hell, how about all of them because that sure as hell happens.
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:40:18
You're missing my point, I know its difficult so I'll go slowly for you. There are underlying issues that every single device has, not everyone is effected by these issues, or some people may not notice that they are. But it is there, these are things that almost certainly *will* happen to a very large number of devices. I'm not a shitty standard tech support advisor, I have a pretty good handle on trending issues and its worse than you think. But hey, if the glasses are still rose, enjoy it by all means.
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:08:45
But my point is that my list of wants *aren't* that obscure. People do want these options, and just because apple doesn't want you to do that you simply cannot do it, at all. The fact that you state glitchiness as a reason to not use these features shows that you know next to nothing about the competition and their phones. I'd wager that you've not used an android phone for some time, so you have some strange misconception about how well it works. these "broken and glitchy" features work perfectly. You're fine with apple's approach to making devices and thats fine, it means that you fit apples bill for a customer to the T. But please stop acting like you know anything about mobile devices because you clearly do not.
