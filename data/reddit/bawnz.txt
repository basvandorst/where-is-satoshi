If only he wasn't a thief, and a criminal.

[Yeah, he seemed real innocent.](

I'll let you pick a better example if you want, i'll wait for your response. If you chose to pick the same person then you really are as stupid as you're coming off.

You want them to shoot water guns at a criminal evading arrest after just having led them on a police chase throughout the city in a stolen vehicle?

Please state where I said it was? Or did you miss the part of him stealing a vehicle, running from the police on foot, and grabbing into his bag as he's being told to stop? I'd rather take the police doing their job correctly for once over the misery of a loss of a scumbag.

Nope, your childhood long friend looked like a criminal evading arrest after just having led the police on a chase throughout the city in a stolen vehicle...

Officers of the LAW, not PEACE.


No, but the penalty for continuing evasion after two suspects were aprehended without harm, continuing to put other officers and civilians in danger while grabbing into an unknown bag reaching for an unknown item potentially risking death of the officers who are ENFORCING THE LAW could lead to being taken down by force deemed necessary by said officers.
