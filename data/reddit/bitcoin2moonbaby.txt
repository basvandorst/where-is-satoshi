i guess btc is more gold then a currency at the moment. but so it can not be a threat to countrys... at the moment. a currency that is full controlled by the people is a nice idea, but is the world really ready for a crypto currency that no government can controll? and will this ever happen? without controlling the money we will have anarchy. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:14:02
if bitcoin and LN fail, all coins will fail

I remember the dot com bubble. Similar to ICOs today. And most Icos are on ETH. So when a lot of the ICOS are worthless, what will happen with ETH ?  
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:12:57
I like the answer from Andreas to what he thinks of the Most ICOs and what will Happen with the Money. That a lot of kok is for sure involved when the heads of new ICOs get millions of Dollars ������
