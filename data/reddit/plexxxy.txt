he would have lost 10% in FX-rates and admin banking fees wiring the money to the UK, he could have lost a bankers draft, so to him carrying the cash was the best method.

My brother won 300k in Vegas in Poker World Series his US friends all had to pay tax, he didn’t, and even came back to UK with 100% of it in US cash (signed letter from Casino to allow US customs for larger than 10k denomination limit)

why? no-one knew about it, he carried it on as hand luggage so it was with him at all times.

Because gambling/lotteries are tax free in UK, and there is special arrangement for UK citizens who win money in US not to pay tax. working is different.

sorry fella as interesting as your person interactions with him go I think it’s all an act. I’m not saying his isn’t smart I just saying he is a genius.

When you come across that confident you can basically blag and manipulate your in making others think you are super intelligent. I’ve just seen a copy of his Uni transcripts for stats he got Cs and D’s at best. he is not all he is made or making out to be (and this comes from someone who has two good degrees) and worked along side many PhDers.
