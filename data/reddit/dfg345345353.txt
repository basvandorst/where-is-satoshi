IMO, no. Firstly I very much doubt they are processing $150mm per month, but even if they were - what's their profit on that? If they made 0.20% (seems about right of for an exchange) they'd have made $300k, or ~3.6m/yr. Revenue certainly doesn't justify a $1b valuation. Most likely they are still burning VC money at a loss.
Perhaps more importantly, coinbase has nothing that can't be replicated by someone else so there's no reason to pay a premium for it.

 - there are actually 230k keys that contain one BTC or more, but 30k of them belong to satoshi. Probably many of the remaining 200 belong to the same people too..

I'm surprised they haven't already shut it down, so maybe it's run by people with the right connections and it won't.. but I still don't think it gives them that much of an advantage.. the main reason that many other people aren't doing this is because it's assumed that they will get shut down. Unless their connetions can arrange to selectively shut down their competitors as they emerge I guess :p

A 1% fee probably won't be sustainable long term. I don't know how much money they're transferring but there are less than 200k people who own 1BTC and not all of them are US based. If we assume that any really big players are trading directly on a 'real' exchange and avoiding the 1% fee then I doubt they're seeing much more than $15mm they had back in may.. the average bitcoin user probably only trades a few times a year so a trippling of the customer base is not going to necessarilly make much difference to their monthly revenue figures.
I think you are chronically overestimating the first-mover advantage here.. coinbase is far from even being the first mover there have been many previous first movers who are nolonger around. Coinbase operates in violation of 47 state money transmitter laws and could easily join the exchange graveyard.
