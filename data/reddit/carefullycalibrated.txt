So what exactly is the lightening network, having a hard time figuring that out 
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:43:48
That was the general impression I've gotten from my (very little) research

I bet they go cold before the transaction confirms.

Hmm, sounds too good to be true. Will like to see it in affect. I hold very little BTC now in an attempt to diversify, so my interest in this "lightening network" is about as great as yours.

Some altcoins can be purchased via PayPal by individual sellers. Potcoin is the only cryptocurrency I've ever purchased this way. You could then use an exchange service such as ShapeShift or Changelly (without an account) to changed your alt into BTC. 
Edit: there is definitely a premium on PayPal to crypto transactions, but I suspect alts will have lower fees by sellers than BTC

So much for micropayments... BTC has some major flaws, scalability being number one!

Good luck with the buggy killer wireless on the xps.

Yeah, and its crashing all the big exchanges.... Oops, I mean banks...

PayPal to a Potcoin seller, then changelly or ShapeShift into BTC would be a good route. 
I'm sure other alts are exchanged via PayPal too

Was recently in Detroit and got a chance to tour Dan Gilberts collection of buildings. It's really deep into a revitalization process that I think will once again allow the city to flourish

Detroit, the next New York

Went to purchase a game priced at $3.99, when I went to checkout with btc, bitpay said I was to owe $9.50! 
They wanted more for the transaction than the actual game! 
I chose not purchase it at all.

Bitcoin's great and all, but if you need to pay them so soon, why not in cash?
