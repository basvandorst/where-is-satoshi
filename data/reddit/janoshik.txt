But hey, I'll bite:
1. You are implying the spam attacks did not happen
2. You are implying that "us" guys forced a fork. that a) forcefully puts, for example me in a group b) implying I care at all about how many shitcoins are forked off
3. You are forecasting future
4. You don't acknowledge that an issue might have more than one cause (DOH)
5. comparing bitcoin to using cash in a store
A whole lot of fallacies, ain't it, troll?

Because addressing each and every logical fallacy gets old really fast and drains much more time than producing the fallacy. 
Your fallacies are numerous, so I either take you for:
1. stupid/maniupulated
2. troll
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:34:38
Woah. 
Now. I don't get it. What took them so long? 
I'm a bad programmer, simply put. I could not program a service such as Protonmail if it meant saving my life. Last time I programmed (a rather simple php app) was years ago. 
And yet, with two days of slowly-paced work I was able to implement a bitcoin as a payment solution into my website (which I have not launched yet). 
Core made implementation such an easy task that it was a breeze. 
And even if my node had crashed for some reason, I can just back it up through blockchain API, which is again incredibly easy to implement.

/r9k/ and /b/, to be more precise. as far as I am aware
@_date: 2017-08-30 16:01:25
Small transactions are INSTANT with bitcoin, as far as I am concerned, so the processing can start immediately on my side.
By the time any cost is incurred on me, the transaction has multiple confirmations and I have nothing to worry. 
With Paypal, the money show immediately as well, but with smaller businesses the paypal can and DOES freeze the funds for 30 days, if I recall correctly. 
So why don't you compare 14 minutes with 30 days? 
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:48:33
There's this thing about trolls from /btc/. 
They sure help to pay a lot of reddit server time. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:27:40
What a load of horseshit. 
The "manual" way they've been doing up until now took 5 days on average for me. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 17:12:07
Wow, what a witty comeback. You sure did show me. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:14:51
Sure, all cryptos started up with almost free transactions. 
Hell, even BTC had negligible transaction fees not that long ago.
  
Now, shitcoin cash has on average less than 30k transactions per day. 
BTC has 10 times that. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:51:52
Good point.

@_date: 2017-08-14 10:01:54
I don't know. 
It feels like a huge %age of their customers would be interested in using BTC as it provides more anonymity. 
And you don't use protonmail unless you want anonymity.

@_date: 2017-08-26 21:38:36
No, the question I'm asking is why is there a statistic anomaly in regards to this sub, new users and their claims. 
Why do new users on bitcoin subreddit feel the need to recreate profiles at 80 times the rate of darknet vendors, steroid dealers and many other scary folks? 
Not saying it has to be you, necessarily, but vast majority of new users having this claim on this sub are astroturfing imo. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:58:52
As an owner of a company I am not thinking of accepting paypal ever.
As the minimum payment I receive is 60 euro, I (or the customer - in the end it is the same, as costs are ALWAYS projected on the customer) can choose to miss out on 3 euro on each and every single transaction with paypal or miss out on 3 euro on 1/25th of the transactions that are sent with fee just as high. Most of the payments I've ever received had fee less than 1 euro. Whether it was measly 60 euro transaction or massive 12 000 euro order (fun fact, I'd pay over 500 euro to paypal for that!).  
Along with Paypal freezing accounts with no reason whatsoever, holding frozen funds for months with no operator capable of determining what is the issue and frequent fradulent chargebacks - I've had my fair share of those in the beginning of my business...
@_date: 2017-08-14 09:59:26
I could've been more clear. 
" they don't allow automatic sign up paid in BTC because of one confirmation taking a long time." 
compare one confirmation to 5 days it used to take them to approve bitcoin payments manually - like that used to do up until now
that's what I had pointed out

Like I said - "Sure, there are ways to bypass that, but they are, relatively speaking, slow - robbing the miners of any advantage." 
The traffic from miners is easy to analyze even for me - therefore identifiable, therefore traceable. 
Mining and relying on satellite data is... well, in my opinion waste of resources.

The "easy way out" that you seem might be a solution is a really bad idea. If you don't see why, educate yourself. 
Also, if you don't understand why there is seemingly a disparity in between miners and nodes in terms of power requirements, you lack basic understanding of the network.

I disagree here - there is a central point in China where the miners can be cut-off. The internet. 
Sure, there are ways to bypass that, but they are, relatively speaking, slow - robbing the miners of any advantage. 
The miners will be also extremely easy to track down - you are speaking about local bureaucrats, but they can be tracked easily on a national level.
The internet is not the only weakness. 
I'm oft in Czech Republic, where minorities are known for illegally growing cannabis. They are usually busted quite early - due to the fact they consume electricity - even if they do so off the meters / semi-off-the-grid. 
I can imagine that in China the centralization of the energy supplying companies might be not as pronounced as in small Czechia - but still the use of energy alone would probably be enough to pinpoint mining operations - not to mention the combination with internet traffic of specific nature. 
I'd be very happy if you'd express your thoughts about this, if you don't feel like that, have a nice day and keep it rocking.
