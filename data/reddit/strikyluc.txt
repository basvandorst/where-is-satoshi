He makes some good points and then continues by saying litecoin is a good alternative. The kid has no clue, doesn’t know what he’s talking about. Litecoin is just the same as bitcoin: high energy consumption and will run into the fee issue when it gets used more. 
He’s the new Roger Ver, get rich off bitcoin, start investing into something else and start shitting on bitcoin. Rinse and repeat to x100 your investment every couple of years.

@_date: 2018-01-14 17:02:30
The advantage is that you can transfer it without having to trust a middle-man. The great thing about bitcoin protocol is that it’s hard to attack and incentivises miners not to cheat. Unfortunately bitcoin has grown so fast that the network is having trouble resulting in high fees or long transaction times. People are working on scaling solutions obviously. But that’s a different discussion.

They are pissed off that bitcoin core development is not doing what they want and therefore they have an incentive to make bitcoin look bad. Bitcoin Cash is what they want because they will do everything that the big players want. And all of them have Bitcoin Cash from the fork, so they don’t loose anything if Bitcoin Cash takes over. This is what happens when an open-source initiative goes mainstream. The big boys come out to play and they will do anything it takes to gain control.

It’s a hard fork which is not easy. On top of that, if services keep being inefficient in their usage of the network, we would be in the same situation really fast.
I think services need to adopt segwit and start using the network in an efficient way. And then a block increase will come soon.
Also look at their promises: they were going to adopt segwit, they didn’t. If they would have gotten a block increase, we would now be on a chain with bigger blocks and no incentive for them to clean up their mess.

This is part of the issue, it’s so easy to persuade people like you with some simple marketing. Now a lot of people like you think that Bitcoin Cash will solve all problems. 
Let me give an analogy: Coinbase gets a small room which is just big enough for them. But then they make a mess of it and manage their space really inefficiently. And instead of cleaning up the room they start yelling and screaming that they need a bigger room. The truth is: they will get a bigger room because they grow up and need more space. But they first have to become efficient. Because otherwise they will stay ineficient and the bigger room will become a mess again in no time.

On a technical side: services need to start using the network efficiently. With bigger blocks they will just continue being innefficient and the network will be congested in no time.

Bitcoin development is not done by a private firm where one guy makes the decision. It’s developed by big group of distributed developers. Every decision is consensus-based and each contribution is extensively reviewed. All the code is open-source.

* how long will it take until network becomes congested again, even with bigger blocks? and it would be dumb to just keep increasing block size
* POW blockchain is simply not scalable without second layer unless you use huge blocks which is a no-go. instead of centralizing mining power, other solutions are preferable

and, did you buy again? or are you waiting for another dip?
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:17:33
yes, but it comes with a cost of spending a lot of time finding the next pump. if OP's bitcoin percentage went up like that i bet he doesn't do this and he bought a bunch of alts that just went down on the BTC rate. look at ethereum since june, LTC  since july, i can go on...

@_date: 2017-12-08 21:58:32
the bitcoin network has a lot of pending transactions right now. coinbase calculates a fee based on this. in order to make sure your transaction is confirmed in a timely fashion a high fee is necessary.
what i usually do is move my coins to gdax (owned by coinbase), which is a free transfer. and from there you can move them to your own wallet, also for free!
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:41:57
Check the transaction on your Coinbase account. It might still be pending. They try to group multiple transactions and therefore it can take a while before the actual transaction is included int  the blockchain.

you might be an observer but it seems you're lacking the technical background. furthermore, it's not because there's the MySpace example that this will happens here too. 
also, in case you haven't noticed. iota is currently at best a beta product. which means they still have years before it can mature into a useable decentralised censorship resistant currency.
bcash has taken the easy route of just increasing block size which comes a different set of issues.
also, can you enlighten me why LN won't work or won't solve the problems?

Lightning network and other solutions will focus on micro payments. The general idea is that bitcoin blockchain is not suitable for registration of all small transactions when more people start using it. You would need huge blocks to even try this which will lead to miner centralisation.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:52:03

euhm, this is not exact science. what people are referring to is that BTC will drop a bit and the total value of both will be roughly the same as BTC right before the fork. but in the end it's just supply vs demand.
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:36:33
the big issue right now is scaling, the fees are too high. there are 2 sides: bigger blocks vs 2nd layer solutions (off-chain). segwit is a start for 2nd layer (lightning network). BTC has segwit activated. segwit2x wants bigger blocks on top of that.
my preference: 2nd layer solutions, no bigger blocks right now. bigger blocks might result in more centralisation in favor of miners. 2nd layer solutions might bring in new players.
but you should really do your own research what this is all about. google block size, segwit, lightning network, NYA. have fun :)

@_date: 2017-11-06 02:03:35
they can signal whatever they want, it's not binding. in the end they will do whatever makes them the most money. 
they prefer bigger blocks because that would mean more power to them because they have the resources to handle a bigger chain. but if nobody uses B2X there will no work for them and no money to be made.
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:15:56
That's painful. You got ripped of by the scammers. I also see you're pretty rude against a guy on here who actually tells you the thruth. You tried to gamble but you forgot one thing. Bitcoin is a much more solid and mature project than the fake rip-off that is called BCash.

Sorry but this a bad attitude. His comment is the truth.
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:33:59
lol, show me the source where they say they're against scaling.
they want to work on off-chain SCALING first before going to bigger blocks. both solutions will result in less decentralisation. but bigger blocks only favours the miners and we all now how that will end. off-chain might bring in new players. you make the choice for yourself

167,000 per second. how about you start a campaign to feed the hungry, to help those that actually need it? instead of filling the deep pockets of the greedy. or do you just want us to support a campaign that will increase the fiat value of your bitcoins? do you understand what i mean?

He actually makes a deliberate choice at a point where price is still soaring. What is your reasoning for not selling. You think this parabolic growth will continue?
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:44:23
lets's hope they spend the rest of the week pumping the price again so we can hit my target and can get some more cheap alts. hopefully Coinbase still has some fiat ready so they can eat through some of the sell walls.
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:52:25
the fork is an attempt at taking over bitcoin development team. yes, you will get coins on the other chain too. but this will not magically give you double value in fiat terms.
pleas do not put your money in something you don't know. do your research and don't FOMO in because the price has been soaring the last couple of weeks.
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:09:56
It might give you fiat gains but it's still a shit coin.

@_date: 2017-11-12 23:17:07
people seem to forget that the last push has been caused by two forks in a row. BTC was seriously overbought over an extended period. i hope greedy people would stop buying into these forks and not pump the price artificially. in the end only deep pockets are making money out of this.

i don't think the people that are panic selling are on reddit. most people here will either try to daytrade on this, or just sit through it and buy some of the dips.
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:22:33
it might be, it might not be. all depends on supply vs demand. i expect BTC price to drop after this huge rally which will cancel out the gains made out of the alt coin. or even worse: mayhem, because this looks like an attack on bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:26:06
the correction just started... it dropped almost 1k while BCH is not rising that much anymore. please check the charts and look at the steep curves in the last month.

why do think price will jump? it's already rising way to fast. and last forks resulted in a drop.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:18:37
2 hours of doing research and you would have come to this conclusion yourself...
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:18:21
he will probably see this as another argument for his fraud, bubble theory: look, look, how much it's soaring, definitely a bubble. watch him come out again after the fork in case the price takes a beating... he will be ready together with his friends, trying to add fuel to the flames
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:57:46

don't worry, 30,000,000 Tether just created. sell walls were eaten in no time. if they keep printing them at record tempo we will be at 10k in no time.
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:25:37
The danger is unsustainable growth backed by FOMO's who will bail out when they see a big red candle. Let's be honest, the soaring of the last week is a bit too much. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:09:54
this gets even better: 
after all, you did put your money where you mouth is. respect!
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:02:24
this is not proven at all and it's based on some text on a white board that was shown on purpose during a youtube interview... big money is increasing their bags of BTC on the back of newcomers who are buying at ATH and then sell when they see a big red candle.
they know that if they take over the whole market will loose confidence and it all falls apart. do you really think a project with almost no developers backed by dubious personalities will be able to take over without crashing the market?
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:21:55

@_date: 2017-11-08 23:39:48
even worse, you choose their side even if they go to a different destination.
the truth is: you gambled on a project you don't support, just for some possible easy gains. put your money where your mouth is.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:59:28
we're currently at the same price as 2 weeks ago. it's not over yet. exactly 1 month ago we were at 4700.
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:13:55
and that's what they want: more profit for them. more BCH bag holders and more BTC for themselves. if they really want to take over they're really dumb because then everybody will loose, including themselves. unless they cash out and leave.
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:02:26

@_date: 2017-11-26 01:26:53
the problem is that most of the coins are not available. locked in gdax, bitstamp, ... so the circulating supply is actually much smaller. if exchanges would actually make them available the price would drop because all of us will just try to sell.

@_date: 2017-09-10 21:54:47
the alternative would be: decent job for everyone so he doesn't have to sell hotdogs in front of your house.
it has nothing to do with crypto. if you think that's really the case, good luck with with the crypto drug dealer in front of your door.
@_date: 2017-09-03 01:17:06
i advise you to read up on cryptocurrency, paper wallets, hardware wallets, exchanges, ... you should feel comfortable before you start spending money. if you believe in the potential it doesn't really matter if you have to wait a couple of weeks before you buy.

i don't know what to say to you guys, apparently for you it's ok to do whatever you please. and then you come back with with this nonsense about "corporate banner", "uncle sam". you kids should understand this: your freedom ends where mine begins. sell your hotdogs on a market, at a party, at the beach. but not a random place. what's so hard to understand?

i know, but trading bots are not exclusive to cryptocurrencies and anybody can write/use one. it's actually a good thing that they provide an open-source initiative. now don't get me wrong, i have some doubts about trading bots. but people will use them so they might as well provide an open-source alternative for it.
and then imagine that we as small fish can use our own bot to buy some btc based on our terms instead of putting fixed limit orders on an exchange.

i completely understand but we're not at 5k anymore. you're talking about a bull trap AT THIS MOMENT. we're not talking about 2.5k difference, we're talking about a difference of a couple of 100's... what you're proposing is selling when it's high and buying when it's low. in order to make money that way you have to spend all your time analysing the market and make perfect decisions...
what i'm saying is: you might as well buy a little bit now, buy some more in a month, and next month... if it goes up to 20k that will still do for most people.
you're just trying to be a smart ass, talking about a bull trap because it goes up a couple of percentages.

how will it grow to a couple of trillions? a lot of stable investors are needed for that. if it's unstable like it is now merchants won't adopt it. as long as the market is dominated by gamblers and speculators we will have huge dips and rises.
@_date: 2017-09-17 02:26:04
ok then, i think you're looking at it in the wrong way. a trading bot that is abused is the problem here. the trading bot is not the issue here. the problem is that people can use it for spoofing or any other dirty tactic. this is illegal in stock markets, but not on crypto exchanges.
it's pretty simple: the bot watches the order book and puts up a sell/buy wall trying to trick others. don't blame the technology, blame the losers abusing an unregulated market.
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:36:06
i'm just not sure that 'the sale is over'. although it seems to recover a bit i can't believe that price will rise quickly again. so the 'sale' will go on for a bit.
@_date: 2017-09-16 03:29:59
You won't become a millionaire but if it does become what it intended to be, a decentralised p2p payment system, then at least we'll all have a head start. If you believe the value will go up over time, then you might as well put some of your savings into bitcoin gradually. Keeping it in the bank is pointless anyway.
Also keep an eye on other technologies that might improve on the blockchain that bitcoin pioneered.
@_date: 2017-09-10 22:24:18

@_date: 2017-09-17 01:04:06
Bitcoin is not a scam but maybe these people are referring to the following:
* a lot of people buying bitcoin and other coins don't care or have no clue why bitcoin was created, they are either pure speculators or gamblers
* the blockchain tech is abused by groups of inexperienced devs with no working product to raise millions of dollars donated by, again, speculators and gamblers
* the market of altcoins is easily manipulated by pumpers and speculators
* it was meant to be a currency, a decentralised payment system but after all these years almost no merchants accept it
I believe in a decentralised p2p payment system, blockchain or whatever technology might arise in the future. But I'm very sceptical of the current situation. Just look at the response you get here. Just fanboys without any reasoning.

i'm not sure. they neglected this space because there was no imminent threat. the last six months changed everything and they're out in full force.

maybe it wasn't hist first time. maybe the residents were fed up with having hot-dog stands in front of their door. please do not jump to conclusions AND don't think that cryptocurrency is a free ticket to do whatever you want. this guy should not be selling hot-dogs at that spot and therefore he has no right to the money he made. this might sound harsh but please respect the people who live there.

the suits just saw a chance to attack a 'wounded' animal. expect more of this soon. they will do everything to protect their position.

the suits made an agreement behind close doors. that's why we can't have nice things. because the greedy suits want to defend their position

if it's the 1385th time, a ticket would mean nothing. in that case it would just mean: continue with what your doing even if the neighbours are fed up.
please let's have some common sense. it's just not ok to have a wild west attitude. again, i feel sorry for him. but i would never do something like that.
