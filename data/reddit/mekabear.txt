yeah he only has .3 btc to his name and wanted to test a tiny amount.

That article voices russian concerns about Bitcoin (similar to chinese concerns) but does it really ban bitcoin?  Not what i'm reading! 
@_date: 2014-11-17 18:36:33
That's terrible and you have my sympathy.  Bunch of scumbags can't have it both ways.  Either they pay you original amount of btc back or the full value of dollar.   They sound so bad that I wouldn't dare trust store credit with them, or at least I would have triple checked it.

"How can you invent such a thing, that doesn't have a log of all transactions ever made?  It could be used to buy drugs, fund terrorism or corrupt politicians campaigns and no one would ever  know?  It should be banned!"

IF you think about it, if you had an account, you could have it so you could also login online to an account, that you can top up or request to pay you back at will.   Imagine if there was a vending machine chain, so that you, with a few dollars on your account can buy chocolate at will from various machines.

Dogecoin does appear to put the fun back into Cryptocurrencies.  I think i might start getting some/mining some myself at some point.  Bitcoin got so serious after it shot up to high prices. 
@_date: 2014-01-14 23:34:54
Nice work.
@_date: 2014-02-18 18:46:54
Sweet, all I need now is the 3D printer......
@_date: 2014-01-22 00:35:54
That clearly didn't get proof-read by me.  I'll leave it a mystery.
@_date: 2014-01-13 22:49:28
This is true, there is a reason to fear cloud mining/pools in general from getting too big to prevent other parties getting hold of them.
@_date: 2014-01-22 00:37:40
Oh yeah the fee is not the issue (i generally turn it off too) but fee or no fee, couldn't send a smaller amount than 0.001 Btc, wallet wouldn't let him.
Now as Miner Willy stated above its not really a problem at the moment, but what if Bitcoin becomes even more valuable?  Sending smaller amounts will become an issue then.

Its hard to win in the game of cex.  I made similar mistakes in the last few weeks and sad to say I've lost heavily (although i'm sure some of you will enjoy that fact, haters always going to hate).
What gets me is the price of a GHS on cryptsy! 0.018 as I write this, can someone explain why its so high?  (if the answer is people are idiots, I already know this)
@_date: 2014-09-06 13:50:18
Look at those prices on that screenshot, so many bitcoin! 
@_date: 2014-09-22 22:38:18
@_date: 2014-01-21 17:36:43
There was no fee selected as he didn't want to pay a 0.001btc fee for a less than 0.001 btc transaction.

Good luck policing that one Iceland.
@_date: 2014-02-18 19:27:34
Yeah your right.  I hardly ever use vending machines tbh.
@_date: 2014-01-13 13:09:03
"about 2 weeks" LOL BFL catchphrase.
@_date: 2014-06-03 20:36:53
I got worse, i sold nearly 100 at 6 dollar :(
@_date: 2014-01-29 13:28:21
Yes I discovered this on an anonymous service where the only reference to me was my address.  I needed a password reset - when I found out that you can put a message in to verify your address is yours I though it was really clever.
@_date: 2014-06-04 07:00:12
I hear ya, at least I still have something.
@_date: 2014-03-06 16:37:49
Well you could make stuff up about what he said if you thought that someone like him would never want the publicity of suing you, which is probably how it would play.
@_date: 2014-04-08 12:34:20
Yeah not sure how it would compromise 2FA.  
@_date: 2014-04-08 22:47:17
Thanks for this.
@_date: 2015-07-15 17:03:50
No they banned Brits making some of it, it not watching it.   Which is odd.   I like it when they "allow" things because they can't do anything about it.  I mean how do you police it?  Check for the geo location of where it was filmed?  Check nationalities?  Check when it was made?  If a British girl wants to facesit in France on video whilst speaking in a convincing french accent, who is going to work this out?  That's going to be one weird undercover police operation right there.  
@_date: 2015-09-23 02:43:04
Thanks for the info, as it stands, that is too much risk.
@_date: 2013-10-31 14:45:03
Although when they found out they'd probably return all the money citing "reasons" 
@_date: 2013-12-11 01:28:45
You'd think that cyber school word be more turned onto digital currencies.
@_date: 2013-08-08 11:20:09
You have my sympathy.  Mind you i'm still waiting for BFL labs.  
@_date: 2013-10-30 11:19:26
Selling 100 BTC for about 15-20 dollars each in the past.  That was a mistake :(
@_date: 2013-10-31 14:44:40
I like your style.  
@_date: 2013-10-19 14:55:55
CoinJoin?  
@_date: 2013-07-18 16:14:11
True, but some non-drugs people are complete assholes as well you know! 
@_date: 2013-10-18 16:18:50
Yeah, interesting article.  However read through gritted teeth because isn't he involved in Intersango? I used that service previously before it WENT COMPLETELY DOWNHILL.
Just checked out the site and it is closed to new registrations.
I've been much happier switching to bitstamp though.  I've never had a problem with them.
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:46:12
The fact that he can receive money since paypal has frozen their account
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:11:14
I wouldn't say that, I have a degree in philosophy so know how intrinsically linked they are.  I just was referred to when i was a child the whole doctorate thing confused me.  Obviously not now!  
@_date: 2013-08-07 14:15:26
I like using Bitstamp.  Site is good and had no problems transferring either way.
used to use intersango but they let me down massively (not processing anything for weeks, ignoring emails etc)
@_date: 2013-12-11 01:20:35
Its a learned trap.  Children are not born like that.  
@_date: 2013-08-14 13:09:33
I worked out about 10K in first month on a 1500 dollar investment.
I'm not bitter or anything........
@_date: 2013-09-13 13:05:09
I think its every 9 bought they get a free one or something.
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:11:43
@_date: 2013-08-08 11:20:50
Yeah don't expect that, you have to hunt for the source!
@_date: 2013-11-01 11:28:04
This is true.  We have to face a future where the majority of people might not have traditional jobs, automation makes more money than paying factory workers for instance.  
This may require a fundamental shift on thinking and process if we are not to have a society where the majority of people live off benefits.
@_date: 2013-10-22 11:16:51
Not enough resources/too many packages - i mean you can't open everything......
@_date: 2013-11-20 12:00:03
Yes, still feels a bit fruity at the moment though.
@_date: 2013-08-14 13:13:26
What pool would you recommend that does share TX fees?
@_date: 2013-12-11 01:23:57
its how universities work.  I agree it sounds silly.  
@_date: 2013-08-14 16:16:48
Yeah, i'm like do i get a refund from BFL (paypal and credit card should protect me on that)  or do i wait it out.
Saw someone sell a Oct 2012 pre-order (which is when i ordered) for over 2K the other day, so should probably go down this route instead of getting refunded.
@_date: 2013-10-14 15:34:45
To be fair to BFL.  They DID start sending out hardware (a lot later than ever promised mind - massive understatement)
Also they DID respond to emails - just weeks/months after they were sent mostly.
Personally just about to start the whole thing with KNC miner now.  But you said you'd get it delivered by Oct 15th......and so it goes on.
tl:dr - don't pre-order ASICS
