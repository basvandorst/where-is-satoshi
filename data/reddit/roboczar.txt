The only reason to say "the total number that can ever be mined is limited to around 21m. There is therefore no way for a central bank to issue a flood of new Bitcoins and devalue those already in circulation." is if the author is bringing up (baseless) concerns that it is vulnerable to a liquidity crunch and hoarding, reducing or eliminating its value as a medium of exchange. It is not. This is probably due to a simple lack of understanding by the author of the nature of BTC. It's a common myth because the implications are not immediately obvious to people not involved deeply in bitcoin.

But if there is enough hoarding, there wouldn't be enough BTC out there to facilitate exchange, unless there were some method of agreeing to divide the currency further by say (for example), one decimal place, effectively multiplying the monetary base by 10.

That is only one problem: transaction costs. They aren't a feature of currency, it's a consequence of using middlemen to act as trade intermediaries as convenience. Bitcoin transactions incur the same costs. If you use an exchange, do they take a cut? Yes. If you use bitstamp to process your btc purchases do they take a cut? What about the miners? They charge a transaction fee to confirm your transactions. All exchanges of currency come with costs, even face to face direct exchanges. Think about it.

Assuming it's spent or invested, as opposed to simply becoming part of the monetary base. But even then, who cares? Prices go up, but so do wages, as well as aggregate demand. Seems fine to me.

Confidence in the currency being able to function *as* currency evaporates during bank runs and takes an extremely long time to recover on its own. There are many, many historical instances of this, which is why we have central banks to manage expectations. Extended periods of economic underutilization destroys more capital than inflation creates, during the same period.
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:54:04
1) Well, you'd be right, there isn't anything different. Not even Veblen goods, which tend to be priced counter-intuitively, act differently on a macro level. Like the OP you are also making the fallacy of individual choice dictating a macro trend. What matters is aggregate demand (consumption + investment + gov't spending) where consumption is only *one* factor. But lets say lots of people buy well crafted status goods, because they can. They've still spent the money and have lost control over its use. It makes trying to "track" the use of the currency fruitless, just as fruitless as trying to distinguish one good as being higher quality (and thus a better use of money) than another. It's a value judgment, not economics.
2) You need to raise your view a little bit and stop seeing all spending as consumption. Even in your scenario, there is still upwards price pressure (inflation) as the king pays out more and more of his supply to his serfs. Even outright slavery isn't completely immune to this because the kings still have costs to keep their workers alive and pay out of their stocks to do so, driving up prices.
3) You're right about that. Currency is only currency if it is accepted in payment of sovereign taxes, fees or fines. Anything that doesn't have that quality is just a commodity.
4) So why try? It's not necessary. Calling inflation "wasteful" is like someone calling you out for splurging on a burger despite the fact that it was a voluntary exchange between you and the burger place. Both of you got your marginal utility out of the exchange, therefore there is no waste. Unless you're the kind of person that likes to pass value judgments on others for fun.
5) Since the government is the source of currency, and private debt is a public (government) surplus, the only way that those debts could ever get paid is if the government spends and tips the balance of payments in the other direction. This is also why, when people say bitcoin is "deflationary", they don't really understand where deflation comes from and why bitcoin is still just as susceptible to inflation as the dollar is. In order for someone to save, someone else has to spend, and if nobody is spending... it also works the other way around.
@_date: 2013-05-23 17:35:24
But will they spend it in time to prevent an output gap and destructive underutilization of capital? It's impossible to know. The length of the gap between hoarders hoarding and hoarders spending is what defines a recession. FRB and central banks give us tools to shorten and smooth out those inefficiencies and limit capital destruction.
Postwar (WWI or WWII, take your pick) Europe, The Nine Years' War, The panics of 1890, 1893, 1896, 1907, the Great Depression, Post Napoleonic Depression... the list goes on and on. Any time you have a recession or depression, you have a deflationary spiral.

Bitcoin is deflating, that's why we use mBTC now. The value is increasing much faster than other currencies. This is evidence of both speculation and hoarding, not use as currency.
Also, there is no limit to BTC. It is infinitely divisible, and the fractions of BTC all have the same marginal utility as prices fall (due to deflation).

Well I don't know how you personally distinguish what is sensible and what is not. I'm just explaining how it is observed to work on a macro scale. I also don't know what you mean by "ivory tower numbnut"... there is no special direction or intervention here, it's tied directly to game theory and the tragedy of the commons. 
Inflation and deflation are entirely creatures of money velocity. The amount of bitcoin in existence doesn't matter a) because bitcoin is infinitely divisible and b) all that matters is what is spent. The faster the rate of spending, the more inflation you have and vice versa for deflation.
The reason why you see such an increase in demand for goods and services transacted in bitcoin is bitcoin's far, far cheaper transaction costs when compared with most payment processors and even cash (due to the inherent costs of holding cash in stock). It really has nothing to do with its market value or trending value. It's a common misapprehension of the situation.
@_date: 2013-05-23 13:52:53
First of all, the supply of metals is finite. At a certain point, deflation becomes permanent as the metals are not infinitely divisible, eliminating their usefulness as a currency, since it's more valuable for speculators to hoard during deflation.
Also, Bitcoin is infinitely divisible, and immune to deflationary spirals. You can move the decimal point to the left or right as many times as necessary to reflect the value of the currency and control for inflation and deflation.

It won't be repaid because it doesn't need to be. The debt and the attendant bonds can exist until the end of the dollar itself and the US will be able to pay interest on it without any problems.
Why? Because the bonds are denominated in *dollars*. Who is the legal entity permitted to create dollars? The US, as long as it exists as a nation, will never run out of money. It simply can't, because it's the only producer of the dollars that back the bonds. When we need more money, we create it, because we can. Everyone knows this, which is why they buy US bonds.
The only things we need to care about are the rate of inflation and employment.

Not sure if that's non-exchange volume or not? 
From the "Methods &amp; Assumptions" link: "Warning! Transaction volume is strictly a quantitative comparison of the processing volumes across the networks. Transactions should not be considered qualitatively similar in terms of economic activity."
I think it's just straight volume, not controlled for exchange volume, which could be considered mainly speculative. Although Woo doesn't reveal his methodology, his chart indicates that volume is dropping for non-exchange transactions. Most likely he's just filtering out known addresses for exchanges, but I'm not sure.

Ah yes, the fabled debt uprising or the Chinese Debt War. The thing is, these things can *never* happen as long as the US is a nation that prints its own currency and whose debt is denominated in dollars. First, there is the 14th Amendment. Second, increasing the money supply is not a problem as long as there is predictable growth in prices and unemployment is low enough to stave off the effects of deflation. It is impossible to default on debts unless the 14th is violated or we lose the ability to create dollars.

Hold on. Bitcoin isn't deflationary. It both inflationary and deflationary depending how many places to the right or left you move the decimal point. The only differences from a centralized currency are that costs are lower and the shifts can potentially be seamless as the market demands more or less BTC in circulation.
It's potentially more responsive to supply shocks but by no means immune.

You have that backwards. Inflation increases demand for durable goods, because they hold value (in the sense that they can sometimes depreciate slower than currency). In an inflationary economy, it's better to spend now than later, because your money will be worth less and will buy less in the future. Deflation encourages saving and can kick off a paradox of thrift if not managed properly.

They end up with the lion's share of capital... until the central bank recognizes deflationary symptoms and creates more capital, unlocking the "stuck gears" of the economy. The banks will then continue to accumulate the new capital, but it doesn't matter, as the money has served its function as a medium of exchange and a unit of account. Once deflation takes hold, as it must, the central bank releases more currency and the cycle begins anew. You cannot do with with full reserve banking, it completely hamstrings monetary policy once the amount of the backing commodity becomes fixed; it makes the currency worthless for use as currency. Fractional reserve banking gives a government the tools necessary to smooth out deflationary and inflationary shocks, which are destructive to capital.

MMT is really only concerned with capital flows and the velocity of money between sectors. It doesn't matter whether it's bitcoin or dollars or renminbi. New Keynesians feel the same way, though they are more hardline on the necessity of taxation and regulation to moderate flows.
Bitcoin is basically the ultimate fiat currency. It's not backed by anything other than the willingness of others to accept it as a payment. Usually with currency, in order for it to work, need to be accepted as legal tender for payment of taxes to a state... since bitcoin is stateless, it is entirely a social contract between parties. That makes it interesting to economists who are plugged into that kind of thing.
@_date: 2013-10-30 18:03:03
Keep in mind that the "inelastic supply" you are talking about only refers to the Bitcoin unit. It's infinitely divisible, so at some point, the amount of divided BTC in use could theoretically increase the velocity of money and drive down its value, much like inflation.

I don't understand how the effort behind securing a loan is a barrier to lending. Those costs will always be built into the agreed interest rate. In any case that is completely beside the point.

Commercial use of Bitcoin is virtually nonexistant in China. It's primary use is a way for wealthy Chinese to move money overseas due to restrictions on RMB for such purposes. That's why there is a dollar-value premium on BTC China trades, because of the way the government controls the price of RMB; the gap is about the same size as the gap between the value of the dollar and the value of RMB + capital export costs.
If they relax the capital controls on RMB, then expect to see a lot of value taken out of BTC, as there will be less of a reason to use it to move money overseas. What will most likely cause that? Well, if they allow RMB to float and the price increases drastically, they may have a lot of incentive to relax controls. If things stay the same and China's economy continues to weaken, the capital controls will likely remain in place and BTC stays a very attractive alternative to move money.
Now, if you're really bullish, you could be optimistic that social contagion will take hold and there will be commercial adoption as word of mouth spreads, but there's no indication of that yet. It may never happen.

As to the difficulty of central banking policy, I think it is far too early in the game to declare that there will never be a Bitcoin regulatory system. Far, far too early.

As long as more than 1 person has some arbitrary fraction of a bitcoin, it can be used as a medium of exchange. It doesn't matter that one person has 20,999,999.99999999999~ BTC since the remainder is infinitely divisible.
That, however, doesn't mean that the people who hoard bitcoin won't have an enormous increase in value (it's virtually guaranteed); it simply means that holding coins doesn't make any difference when it comes to using BTC to facilitate exchange. Those hoarders will have to cash out sometime (you can't take it with you where you're going), but when that happens and by what degree makes no difference since the rest of the circulating bitcoins can be split up and re-denominated as much as the market deems necessary.

Sure, because it's a really efficient way to process payments electronically and to transfer money across borders. I get it. I think that's great. Anything that lowers transaction costs is a good thing.
However, nowhere is it accepted in payment of taxes to a sovereign government, nor to pay fees or fines levied by said sovereign government, so it will never be a currency until that happens.

That's true for undergrad econ purposes, *however* that does *not* imply that there is always enough spending for the economy to make use of.

Bitcoin is infinitely divisible and can be redenominated at any fraction of a BTC as the market requires. Were you not around when the most common unit of account became mBTC? People are deriving the same marginal utility from a fraction of a BTC because as with all fiat currency, you can derive the same utility from fractions or even factors of the original denomination.
That means BTC's sole advantage is the speed and costs associated with eventual redenomination, which are probably lower than central bank fiat and more responsive to the market.

I do see the benefits, they just aren't the (for now) cheaper transaction costs. It just doesn't intrinsically do anything better than existing currencies unless you are attempting to circumvent trade restrictions or increase privacy. Most people don't value those features as highly as early adopters do and that will likely remain to be the case for a very long time.

Do you have any geological data to support that assertion? Are you going to go to the next step and talk about synthesizing gold from lead? Mining it from the rest of the solar system? The universe? When does it end? The point is that it is finite at some point in the future, which means it will at some point become highly deflationary and lose its utility. FRB bypasses that future concern with few consequences.
You don't seem to understand hoarding of an infinitely divisible currency. One person could have 23,999,999.9999..... bitcoins and as long as someone else holds some fraction of the remainder, it can be used as a medium of exchange.

Ok, but once the ores run out, then what? That's what I'm trying to get you to think about. Eventually it will all be mined; it doesn't matter who has what deposits and how much. It's totally irrelevant to the problem, because commodities flow freely; but once there is no more creation of a given commodity, what happens? It becomes permanently deflationary, promotes hoarding, and destroys its utility as currency. You'd effectively need to adopt a brand new standard in order to have a functioning money economy, which is extraordinarily disruptive... far more disruptive than having a fractional reserve and creating more currency out of thin air, breaking the deflationary spiral and restoring utility.
The thing is, you don't even have to totally run out of a given commodity for it to cause deflation; when there is a gap between the technology used for creation/extraction and the demand for currency, you get a deflationary shock. For a time it's like the economy has "run out" of it, even though technically it still exists in the ground or wherever. The gap between the halt of cost effective extraction and new technology can be long and lead to extended depressions with much destruction of capital, as was the case in the Middle Ages more than once.
As to bitcoin, your argument makes no sense because you can create as many fractions of bitcoins as you want, which is economically the same thing as creating brand new bitcoins. You don't need an "external influx" because the currency itself can be inflationary or deflationary at will, based on market need.

Wrong metaphor I'm afraid. You can derive the same marginal utility from any fraction of bitcoin. I thought that would be obvious since the recent shift from BTC to mBTC as the most commonly used unit of account. Has the marginal utility of the currency decreased because of this? Newp.

BTC is infinitely divisible into fractions from which you can derive the same marginal utility as the original denomination. This has already happened with mBTC but apparently nobody here noticed. The market, if necessary, will ad hoc redenominate if the previous denomination inflates or deflates too much.
@_date: 2013-05-23 13:56:09
Without FRB, at some point the money supply is fixed. That means eventually it becomes impossible to charge interest as lenders continue to accumulate payments from debtors. Eventually the money stops circulating sufficiently to maintain the currency's value as a medium of exchange due to a spiral of deflation that will never end. FRB ensures that capital creation can continue independently of the backing commodity.

Nope. I used to think so too, but it turns out that with a small change in the BTC code, you can have infinite fractions of a satoshi. Many people do not know this, apparently.
It will eventually need to happen, or deflation through hoarding and attrition will conspire to make BTC useless as currency.

She may be fuzzy on the technical details, but I'm not, and nothing she's said conflicts with the basics of the currency. Yeah she gets a little wild about the hype but frankly, she's not all that wrong.

The price is very volatile at the moment, but generally trending upward over the last year. I think that it is a worthwhile investment, but only after you've learned about the pros and cons of the currency and whether it's going to work for you.
I personally keep topped up on bitcoin for 10% of my NW as an investment, but different people have different ideas about what they prefer.
Keep in mind that you can actually *use* your bitcoin to buy pretty much anything you want, from food to electronics to games, so there's that to consider as well.
The main thing here though, before you get too far ahead of yourself, is to gain control of your wallet and make sure you're protected and you understand the process. Otherwise you're walking on a razor, so to speak.

@_date: 2013-05-24 10:44:51
Yes you can, and you'd have to, eventually. Bitcoin is inherently *de*flationary, but unlike commodity backed currency isn't vulnerable to the effects of deflation. You can move the decimal point to the left and you've suddenly created more Bitcoins. Move it to the right and you've taken Bitcoins out of the money supply. The utility of BTC is that the market can inflate or deflate at will depending on the demand for the money supply.

Wow. You really don't have a single clue do you? Equating national monetary policy to retail banking? What is this a joke?
It doesn't matter who owns the debt, or how much of it we have as long as the growth of the money supply tracks with an accepted rate of price stability and employment. Once those two conditions are met, the size of debt itself is immaterial.

The financial sector (including your "well connected" fat cats) is part of the private savings sector. But of course, you wouldn't agree with this because you think that the very real 1:1 (measured) inverse relationship between gov't sector spending and private + capital account savings doesn't exist. It's totally unbelieveable that someone with a supposed economics major wouldn't know about this relationship, or that they would just not believe that it exists despite being well studied and observed.
1) The government creates the currency. The currency that is created has value because the gov't accepts it in payment of taxes, fees and fines. Because of this simple and uncontroversial fact, changes in the money supply are inextricably linked to government action. There is no way that you can have a situation where two people using gov't currency can avoid it. Because bitcoin can never fulfill the tax remittance condition, it will be forever a commodity used to move money or make low cost transfers within a currency or between currencies.
2) You started off making sense, then you went into a bizarre analogy and now I have no idea what you are talking about. The financial sector is so large because *it's what the US is good at*. It's the sector in which we have the greatest comparative advantage, so I don't know why it matters how large it is. It could be 99.98% of world GDP or higher, but all that would mean is that it's simply more productive than the primary or secondary sectors and thus is what we put most of our means of production toward. Basically, what you're saying makes no sense in pretty much any context.
3) This old canard again? Proof that people on the losing side of an argument have no sense of humor. No, of course your "perpetual war" scenario wouldn't be the best way to increase aggregate demand, nor would digging up bottles of cash buried in a coal mine, or an alien invasion or whatever silly thing an economist you don't like says to make light of the simple fact that government spending equals private savings and that when the aggregate supply curve is too flat, spending has to increase in the short run to make up the shortfall in potential output. In most cases (obviously not all cases because the externalities that might appear could just make the problem worse) it doesn't matter what the government spends on as long as it spends when the AD curve is too far to the left.
But in any case, I just wasted an hour of my life only to have you dredge up something else from your blogs to show that I'm wrong when in reality neither of us is going to learn anything from the other. So I think it's best to end the conversation now.

There's nothing to reconcile, because Keynesian economics isn't concerned with individual currencies, and bitcoin doesn't change that dynamic at all.

@_date: 2013-11-08 22:46:52


Yes. MMT does not require a centralized monetary system in order to describe a functioning money-based economy. Money is a social contract and an agreement between parties, nothing more.
Bitcoin, just like anything that doesn't exclusively fill a human need, has no intrinsic value, just a socially accepted value between parties. It is a *means* to fulfill human needs, but does not fill needs on its own. Thus it is not "backed" by the only "backing" that is real; biological necessity.

It is not so, at least not initially. Postwar Germany underwent a massive deflationary shock as demand collapsed and drove down the value of Reichsmarks, causing prices to fall and unemployment to rise, exacerbating currency hoarding. The Bruening government and the Reichstag attempted to solve the problem by printing more marks, but were insensitive to the signs of inflation and didn't modify the policy in time to prevent hyperinflation, which has its own set of problems and eventually precipitated another World War. We remember the hyperinflation because it caused the war, but we forgot what caused the hyperinflation in the first place. It's a problem with people just not knowing their history.
Yes, central banks cannot have all knowledge, but they have more than anyone else, and as such can make more informed decisions based on data. The object is to smooth out the shocks... central banks will likely never be able to prevent them, unless some technological change or fundamental truth is discovered that allows it.
The price mechanism falls short in this case because of price stickiness. If we rely solely on price signals, it deepens shocks because both prices and wages are "sticky". In the case of wages, they are *extremely* sticky, which is why peripheral Euro countries are having such a hard time going through "internal deflation" to restore competitiveness compared to the Core EU. If wages and prices resist deflation too strongly, it can take a long time for price signals to fix the problem. In the meantime, that is a lot of idle capital not being utilized for production, and not all capital is non-perishable. Even machines and factories have a shelf life, and if the recession goes on too long, it can be much more difficult to recover, because you're having to replace what is effectively "destroyed" capital... all because you waited for price signalling to fix the problem instead of intervening.

3) How do you deal with supply shocks if you can't inflate the currency?

Well, there's the bronze age palace economy based on centralized food distribution and the koku system of feudal japan representing rice harvests... it's not common anymore... but money systems based on noncompulsory commodities rely on a national government's willingness to accept said commodity as payment for tax. 
Where do you draw the line between what is compulsory and what is not? You'd have to go to the biological sciences... cubic meters of air per second? Calories per hour? It would be virtually impossible to know, which is why we rely on preferences and the price mechanism to attempt to quantify those needs. 
Just because you can't put a single number down and say "this is an item's intrinsic value" doesn't mean it doesn't exist. It exists on a continuum tied to an individual's hierarchy of biological needs.

It's not anything that any one "does". It's an effect of deflation, and in the case of bitcoin, is done through the market. As prices fall, hoarding increases because if you can buy more things with your money later, there's less reason to spend it. This takes money out of circulation, causing scarcity. There isn't a shortage of bitcoins, it's simply that they aren't in the money supply functioning as money. We've had this problem already, where the value of bitcoin to prices has become high enough that in order to function as a currency, you have to start using fractions of bitcoin, increasing the velocity of the money left in circulation, stabilizing prices as there is "more" money to spend. In reality there is just more of the same money changing hands more frequently, but it actually has an inflationary effect on prices, which disincentivizes hoarding, putting more money into circulation.
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:11:27

People value money that they have now more than money they will have in the future. This gives money a time component, in that if someone needs money now and you can lend it to them,  you will want to be compensated for not having the use of it for X period of time. We are not immortal, and as such,  losing use of money for a period of time is a disadvantage unless so compensated.
This is virtually impossible to sustain unless you lend with a fractional reserve; the demand for money now far outweighs the impetus to save. FRB is a response to lending demand as we never know when we are going to die, giving borrowing increased cognitive weight.

I hate to break it to you man, but Bitcoin is not immune to inflation or deflation. The difference is that it inflates and deflates with fewer costs, making it a more efficient medium of exchange and unit of account than centralized fiat currencies. 
But then again you think that people just "make up" these numbers, just because they're "the government" (what? haha.) so there's really no point in discussing it.

The effect is the same as increasing the supply of bitcoin available for use, making it inflationary. It increases the amount of currency in circulation by incentivizing hoarders to release more coin into circulation via spending
