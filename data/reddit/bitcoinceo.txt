Stupid coinbase, why are they using bitcoin? It's supposed to be a store of value.

I'm with you, fellow CEO. 
The only way bip101 gets enabled is if a MAJORITY of people agree to it, exactly what bitcoin is all about. 
Censoring all talk of it is asinine and shows that the mods here have ulterior motives.

This fucking subreddit turned into a gigantic "bitcoin is perfect and everyone who says otherwise needs to gtfo". I can't stand this shit anymore.  Throwahoymatie obviously needs the price to go up to make money so he'll close his eyes on anything negative bitcoin related.
I, too have a shitload of coins, and would love the price to go up, but fuck do you have to be a brainless dipshit to not realize that there are some serious flaws that need fixing.

Well you'd think that since you invested so much money in it, you'd at least act rationally to try to make the most of your investment. If bitcoin gets 51% fucked tomorrow, you lose money too.

Bitcoin does need fixing, no amount of me bitching about it will change anything unless the devs change the code to prevent this. And if this can't be fixed then bitcoin deserves to fail.

It's better than cash in that you can send it to anyone anywhere near instantly. Not possible with cash.
And the reason it fluctuates is because of the tiny market cap. People trade it like they do any other foreign currency but because it's so tiny it's easy to manipulate the price. So it's not ready for its intended purpose yet.

It doesn't matter if Satan himself starts using it or talking about it. If it gets bitcoin out to the masses, it's a win. Since with bitcoin, they don't have to use Satan Inc. to hold/process their payments anymore, they can just use bitcoin directly.

@_date: 2014-06-13 16:27:05
I wonder if you could bundle that with proof of stake also. So have 6 algorithms. Have PoS algorithm responsible for overseeing  50% of the network and PoW have the other 50%. 
So the PoS can check if double spends or any other evilness is happening while PoW generates coins. This way if an entity gets 100% of the mining power, they will still have to abide by PoS rules... So people who own bitcoins can check that the miners are playing fair.
Not sure if any of that even makes sense lol.

In this case the onus is on anyone thinking they have Bitcoins best intentions at heart to prove they are trustworthy because centralized mining could destroy Bitcoin. And so far they have shown to nit have bitcoins best interests at heart.
@_date: 2014-06-04 14:06:06
You could also short BTC by being heavy into fiat, i.e. governments and banks. Destroying bitcoin while also possibly profiting by shorting it would be something they could do. Considering the NSA or whatever have massive black budgets, spending a few billion on miners to kill bitcoin or any clones that pop up later would be a good idea to keep the US dollar at the top.

We need catchy shit targeted to different niches, for example 
**to immigrants:**
* "Can you send a thousand dollars in seconds to your relatives overseas for just 10 cents?" 
* "With Bitcoin you can"
And just have a link to some informative site.
**Or gold bugs/preppers:**
* "Scared of the government confiscating your money from the bank?"
* "With Bitcoin they can't"
**To merchants:**
* "Would you like to sell your products to anyone in the world without worries about chargebacks and only pay 0.5% transaction fees?"
* "With bitcoin you can"
I think **"With bitcoin you can"** would be a really awesome catchy slogan.

Getting account info for direct deposit? - All available in your wallet

Any coin running on Proof of Stake would fare against an attack like this since there's no mining needed. The attacker would need to buy up 51% of the entire currency supply to do any damage, which is completely impossible. 
If one PoS coin dies because an entity just spent billions buying 51% of it and then doing double spends, people would just move to another PoS and start where they left off, while the attacker is out billions of dollars. Not so with bitcoin since they can reuse their existing miner farms to attack any other proof of work clones that come along.
I think some sort of hybrid PoW/PoS system is the future.
@_date: 2014-05-28 11:48:33
Oh I definitely agree that crypto will live on, that's why I've diversified into proof of stake coins. I really hope bitcoin succeeds and mining keeps increasing exponentially, because I think once it takes a couple hundred billion to do a 51% attack, then we should be in safer territory. But until then there's always that chance.
@_date: 2014-05-15 21:03:15
The people that read them take them seriously. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:13:48
Ahh that makes sense.
But then lets say a cartel of bankers or governments who want to kill bitcoin decide to collude and buy billions of dollars worth of miners, then mask them all as one big one to get a 99% attack going.

How is more adoption related to a 51% attack not being important?
We can have the whole world adopt bitcoin, but if a 51% attack happens then, if global commerce halts even for a day, everyone will see that bitcoin isn't all it's cracked out to be and move to something else.

@_date: 2014-04-20 14:54:01
Finally someone who actually knows a bit about bitcoin. 
1.  The 51% is, I agree one of the big downfalls that bitcoin might face. But even then, they would have to keep up the attack in order to kill it. They can prevent transactions from going through but they can't confiscate your funds or steal them. So it would bring bitcoin ecosystem to a halt for the amount of time the attack is in place. Would definitely be a huge blow to bitcoin. So yeah this is a valid anti bitcoin point.
2. Just like drugs are illegal and people still use them, they can still use bitcoin in those places that ban them. It's just that banks won't be able to stop you from doing what you want with your money.
3. This is something that's a bonus for living in an area with good banks. I have to pay fees and I live in a first world country. There are hundreds of millions who are the same. And billions of others who can't even get bank accounts.

@_date: 2014-05-28 03:05:26
This isn't a sustainable fix. What if this evil entity keeps up the 51% attack thereby crippling bitcoin. Loss of faith would result and people would start going to proof of stake currencies. Can't really put your business on hold because there's an attack going on.
What if in the future an alphabet agency or government took over one or more of the mining pools under terrorism/money laundering/save the children/whatever reasons? What if a government decided to kill bitcoin and dumped a few billion on miners to do a 99% attack. That's peanuts for them. 
These are the biggest hurdles bitcoin has to overcome. If not, some sort of variation of proof of stake will be the future.
@_date: 2014-04-20 14:58:51

Please show me where I can do it in my bank? I fucking can't and so can't millions of others.

And with older statements, I could probably call in but still would have to go to the branch to pick them up.

So what's stopping someone from making a pre-paid bitcoin visa/mastercard card? That you would acquire in the same manner as you do your current ones. 
The problem here is dealing with banks. When using cash/bitcoin none of these things apply.

That's a wrong assessment. 
Clickbank is a payment processor that allows merchants to sign up and use their system. It offers people who have things to sell a way to accept credit cards/paypal. 
They ban people who sell shitty products that cause a high number of refunds or chargebacks. Back in the beginning they were shady and crappy because they had no quality control. They are very different today. They have an in house team that checks every new product.

I like how you think that nothing is going to happen.
They, or anyone else with 51% can halt bitcoin now, tomorrow, a week from now, next year, in a decade, whatever. 
Just because they didn't do shit right now doesn't mean the attack isn't possible.
It's like if there was a guy pointing a gun at your head. If he didn't fire right away, that means he's never going to fire right?

You can find out where he lives by his posting history/other social engineering, monitor his house, then just go in and steal things of value when he's at work. Or even simply wait for him to return then use the good old pipe to the shins method to get to his bitcoins. If bitcoins go through the roof, you can bet your ass there will be people looking for us as they'll know early adopters have a hefty sum.

It doesn't matter what the back end fees are, what matters is what a person pays per transaction, which is tiny. 
The exchanges take a large chunk since they help you get out of the fiat system. These fees are high because there is very little competition. This is temporary, either until more exchanges pop up, or more people start using bitcoin thereby not needing to convert to/from fiat. 
If bitcoin does succeed, people would be able to get paid with bitcoin by their employer, their rent could be paid in bitcoin and they could buy groceries with it. Then you won't need to pay the 1-2% exchange fees. You'd be at most paying the fractions of a cent in transaction fees. 
Is this a perfect almost never happens setup? If you think bitcoin will fail then yes, but then no other points even matter. If you think bitcoin will succeed than this is an "always happens" setup.

Exactly. Cia,nsa,whatever can take over a pool and make the owners sign gag orders. And none of us would ever even know it happened.
Or they could just spend a couple hundred million and make their own pool rivaling that of ghash. They have billions in black budgets. This is pennies in order to make sure the us government has control over bitcoin. They could even keep machines turned off so people don't become suspicious, and if things get out of hand and they dont like bitcoin anymore do a 99% attack. 
No normal good guy miner is going to do a 51% attack. These attacks would come from people whom bitcoin threatens.

When I returned to the United States after living in Nairobi on and off for two years, these antiquated payment ordeals were especially frustrating. As I never tire of explaining to friends, in Kenya I could pay for nearly everything with a few taps on my cellphone.
However, in rural areas with little access to banks - the so-called "unbanked" sector - platforms that offer money transfer and payment services are rapidly gaining traction. In this non-bank based model, the customer`s money is recorded in a virtual account.

"more than 55 million Africans use basic mobile phones to transfer money [via SMS] from one person to another, take out insurance policies, and collect payment from government agencies. Even at a few bucks a transaction, Africa’s so-called “mobile money” market is huge, topping $61 billion in 2012—greater than the amount of money sent via mobile in Europe and North America combined, according to Gartner."
They are happy with it, and are paying a few bucks per transaction... Bitcoin is muthafukin perfect for this
"M-Pesa allows any Kenyan with a cell phone to withdraw, deposit, and transfer money between accounts via basic text messages. No smartphone app, much less a smartphone itself, is required. Vodafone, the company behind M-Pesa, announced that it would be expanding its offerings to Europe for the first time. People in Romania, one of the lesser-developed members of the European Union, will be able to transfer as little as one new Romanian leu (0.19p) to as much as 30,000 leu (£5,567) via their phones."
**Vodafone says that its 16.8 million active customers worldwide make $1.2 billion (£721 million) in person-to-person transactions every month.** 
People in poorer countries definitely want this. 
So this is pretty huge.

So you'd have massive corporations in control of the mining, they WILL collude, not if, not maybe, they will. And then again we are right back to centralization.

Low fees for people who have their own hardware, and they allow idiots to buy mining contracts. So you can spend as little as you want to buy some Ghashes and mine for as little or as long as you want. 
They simply made it really easy to get into the mining game, so every moron who learns about  bitcoin goes there since you don't have to pre order anything, wait for miners to arrive, set them up, monitor them, troubleshoot them, etc. You simply buy a contract, and it mines for you, with Ghash overlooking all the IT stuff.

It tumbles coins to make them anonymous.
Let's say you bought 10 btc on an exchange and withdrew it to your Bitcoin address. That exchange and probably NSA now know you own x coins. If you spend them they will see where the money goes.
By tumbling, you send those 10 btc to blockchain and they send you back those coins in chunks from other random addresses to your new addresses. Thereby a third party cannot trace where your money went. All they see is 10 btc leaving your address and never returning.

It also depends on the kind of collapse. A Soviet Union style collapse, gold would be worth a fortune as the state Currency became worthless. Since other countries still functioned and many public utilities still worked.
Something where a total collapse happens, where governments cease to exist, then yes only gold, guns and food/water would be useful.

Genuine threats to bitcoin are not fear mongering
@_date: 2014-07-04 14:47:55
You also can't attack PoS for free. You need to buy the coins. And you need to buy a fuck ton of them, which would cause the price to rise astronomically. So before you even begin your attack, you already wasted as much money as you would buying miners to attack a PoW currency.
Also, Nxt isn't using checkpoints.

@_date: 2014-05-11 15:27:21
They arent a direct competitor. They can make btc denominated cards and use their infrastructure to process off the blockchain transactions thereby helping and making tons of money since they wont have  to work with banks.
If they dont do this then who cares. All they can do is lobby to ban bitcoin or add restrictions. In that case we'd have to fundraise and  lobby the other side.

That's not the same. You can make money by simply holding, not so with tcp. You actually have to build  applications/companies that run on it AND they have to be successful. With Bitcoin you can ride others coat tails.
@_date: 2014-04-21 17:56:12
That's true, but the 51% attack and mining centralization is still the biggest threat to Bitcoin. Something the proof of stake coins don't have to worry about. I think time will tell. If mining gets too centralized and a 51% attack happens i would think people might migrate to proof of stake.

But again, all it takes is 1 time for someone to do a 51% attack and bitcoin is done. We can't let that happen, we can't just sit back and hope that ghash is good. They already did do double spends. Who's to say a hacker or another rogue employee or a government agency won't use their miners to do a 51% attack tomorrow? Who cares if they'll lose credibility, bitcoins credibility will be completely gone anyway.

There's only like 10 billion ounces that's ever been mined:  
So if no gold has ever been lost and it got equally distributed, everyone on earth would get around an ounce of gold. Since that's not the case and governments hold most of it, you get the current low price of gold.
The reason gold is low is because of all the paper gold. If like you said, everyone did try to cash those papers and realized they are worth shit, price of gold would skyrocket.

Since the article is broken down into 100000 pages, they can now show 100000x more ads, since the ads change on every page load, and make that much more money.

Actually overstock and newegg give lots of flying fucks about bitcoin. They are helping adoption and trying to get their suppliers to start accepting bitcoin payments. This way they won't need to convert everything to fiat.

Please don't invest in anything. The deflationary nature of it is not very good for investing, unless the investment grows faster than the bitcoins itself grow in value.

Really? What's with this "I hate bitcoin coz its cool" circlejerk on here today.
So sending a wire payment has no relation to sending Bitcoins?
Requesting old statements? - All in your wallet app/site
Opening a new account? - Instant with bitcoin
Getting account info for direct deposit? - All available in your wallet
And before anyone starts bitching at how some of these you can do online. Maybe in your bank you can, but many other banks don't have these features.

This can be abused by stolen credit cards.
Imagine Bob buys a bunch of laptops, peripherals and other electronics, he pays with Bitcoin. Someone then orders these items with stolen credit cards. So now Bob has thousands of dollars of illegally purchased merchandise arriving at his doorstep. 
The scammer gets away scott free with his bitcoins. Bob gets reamed by the police on the stolen cards he used to purchase all these electronics.

Litecoin is PoW. Therefore it can still succumb to centralization with asic farms and other evil entities gaining control over them and therefore the entire network.
PoS coins are not susceptible to centralization in the future. You pay for that benefit by the coins being premined.

I posted these in the thread too:
So sending a wire payment has no relation to sending Bitcoins? You have to go to the bank to do it. Some people, yes are able to do it online. Most cannot and must visit their branch. There, that top most awesome comment already disproved as a lie.
Requesting old statements? If you need statements older than a few months, some do not store them online long enough. For example my bank only does 6 month through online banking. Older, if I missed some I have to visit the branch.
Opening a new account? Some allow you to do it online, many you must go to the branch with your id and other documents. 
Getting account info for direct deposit? If your employer asks for your direct deposit info, you can call in, but would also visit a branch.

Unfortunately you will have to do some manual work putting in the amount of coins u traded on X day. 
Take that excel file, or the one Borax suggested:  add another column with eur exchange rate from something like this: 
the button "download latest exchange rates"
Then you'll have to go through all your transactions and input them on the day they happened. 
In excel you then add another column to the right with the equal sign, and multiply the eur x btc to get total price. You only have to do it once, then just copy to all cells under it.

When Bitcoiners spend btc it gets disseminated. With deflation the people on top's stash will slowly dwindle as they will have to spend to survive. This is the opposite of the current system of inflation where more money just gets printed. 
There is no way for someone to stay a 1% as every satoshi they spend they can never get back as it will get more and more expensive. Even if they run a profitable business,   if the value of btc rises more than they make in profit, they will still have less and less btc. They will still live just as lavishly as they do with Fiat, just that there will be more dissemination of money.

So sending a wire payment has no relation to sending Bitcoins?
Requesting old statements? - All in your wallet app/site
Opening a new account? - Instant with bitcoin
Getting account info for direct deposit? - All available in your wallet
And before anyone starts bitching at how some of these you can do online. Maybe in your bank you can, but many other banks don't have these features.

This is a bit exaggerated. 
The government is taking the money out of the banks and putting it into their own coffers so the banks don't nickel and dime the account with inactive account and monthly fees. 
The government will give all of the money back to the person when requested. You can get all of it back even decades later. Unlike if you tried to do so with a bank, you'd probably get half back from all the bullshit fees they'd charge on it.
So if a person completely forgets about this money, instead of a private bank getting all of the money as free profits, the government gets to keep the money and use it for the country itself.
This is actually a good thing.

You are the idiot is you think ghash can't in the future either turn evil, get hacked, or get overtaken by a government agency.

Well that's what would be nice to discuss, if there is some way to create consensus between the two algorithms. How to figure out which chain would be legit with the others double checking. Maybe have PoS do one block, then PoW do another? This way 51% attack already becomes impossible.

I guess that if my favorite color is green and I ever state this, I will be pumping it and should stop right away?
And calling a really fucking smart guy who's working hard in the crypto field and benefiting us all an asshole because he is stating an opinion is quite fucked up in its own right.

If they keep a 51%, or 70%, or 90% attack up for a few days, what will it do to bitcoin? It'll be the same as destroying it. What business will want to transact in it when their funds can be stuck for days or weeks? How will they pay salaries, merchandise, other urgent things? This can kill a business, and no serious business will want to use bitcoin if something like this happens even once.

1. You need a ton of paperwork to open a bank account before you can even start using the ATMs. 
2. Some people with bad credit scores cannot open bank accounts.
3. Many people in third world countries don't have access to banks/international commerce
4. Most of the things you mentioned apply to first world citizens. 
5. Many people have to pay fees to use banks and withdraw their own money. Maybe that doesn't apply to you, but again, there are millions if not billions of other people on the planet that this does apply to.
There, juvenile and idiotic reasons against bitcoin shut down if you opened up your eyes and saw the big picture. Just because something applies to you does not mean it applies to everyone else.

I don't even...
They are trustworthy? It doesn't have to be ghash that does this. It could be a hacker, a rogue employee or a government agency that takes control of their servers.
You do realize that once anyone does a real 51% attack, bitcoins credibility is ruined forever. Nobody is going to use this currency if all trade in it could be halted at any moment by an evil entity. 
Imagine having to pay suppliers, or shipping or freight companies, or for gas, when bam, none of your payments are going through. Trucks are sitting in the loading bay, customers are waiting, and you can't pay your employees or the electricity bill or anything of that sort. Even if an attack lasts an hour. Imagine a business the size of Amazon grinding to a halt. No serious business will use this.
And it only has to happen once.
The biggest problem is that this 51% attack could happen at any time. It is currently very inexpensive (on a global financial scale) to do a 99% attack on bitcoin by anyone with a spare few billion dollars laying around, which is peanuts! 
The banks made 34 billion in profits in the 2nd quarter of 2012. That's just US banks. What about other international banks? Other governments? All people whom bitcoin would greatly disrupt and who would have an interest in destroying bitcoin.
With the 51% attack, this could happen at any moment.

If an alphabet agency comes to a chip plant, drops a bunch of money and  tells them they need to commandeer the entire production for half a year under homeland security/save the children/whatever reasons, they will give them access. And then you get a 99% attack.

And me. I did so much for bitcoin, like dying multiple times. Then I was back, then I suicided, then I stole bitcoins. And now I'm just sitting in the spaceship waiting for everyone.
@_date: 2015-03-25 23:52:35
I'd like a "CEO of bitcoin" then.
@_date: 2015-03-20 17:04:04
Yeah, just yesterday I was on the moon scouting out the place for when we decide to move there. Back on earth for now to attend to business of cat pictures.
@_date: 2015-03-20 17:05:08
What? He told me we held all the bitcoins. What did he do with them? I hope he didn't lose them.
@_date: 2015-03-20 17:02:31
Damn, I dont log into this account that often, sorry to have failed you. Will commit seppuku in a fortnight.

Satoshi went to the Bahamas, I'll do it. What's your bitcorn username and password?
@_date: 2015-10-22 00:18:44
We do have a CEO.
@_date: 2015-02-20 03:18:13
My body is ready.
@_date: 2015-10-28 15:12:18
Sorry bros, couldn't stop myself.
@_date: 2015-02-21 20:32:14
I'm his ghost, stuck here inside reddit, AMA.
@_date: 2015-02-20 03:01:49
A shot of... drugs? I don't have any marijuanas left though.  Used them all up at the office party.
@_date: 2015-02-20 03:47:30
Thank god I'm not alone in not existing.
@_date: 2015-02-20 03:13:07
I'll back it. With blackjack and hookers. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 19:32:45
Wait for me guys, gotta grab my suit from the dry cleaners.
@_date: 2015-02-20 03:20:04
That seems awfully risky. But I must approve. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 02:56:36
Another thing to remember. There is no Bitcoin CEO. I am a lie.

@_date: 2015-02-19 12:53:16
