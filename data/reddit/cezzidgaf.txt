@_date: 2019-07-21 19:57:15
it requires too much energy..what can i say i was like most of ppl here hating on xrp because its afiliated with the banks. but if u are honest to yourself, dyor and have some brain... you know whats up lol.
Ps libra it will be a stable coin u cant profit out of it.
@_date: 2019-07-13 17:09:45

@_date: 2019-07-21 19:46:51
you dont know what are you talking about.. guys like u are just haters cuz ripple is working with the system.. yea a fucked up system wich make the poor poorer but you are delusional if you think some anarchists can change something
@_date: 2019-07-21 20:49:03

@_date: 2019-07-22 04:28:22

@_date: 2019-07-21 08:51:31

@_date: 2019-07-21 19:38:02
you have to check yourself of you think btc its a better tech than xrp lol
@_date: 2019-07-21 19:43:20
all was speculation. smart ppl made lots of moneies back then cuz ppl couldnt imagine a 30% bitcoin dominance just like most of people cant imagine btc will lose its no 1 spot. This market works on extremes.. what u think can happen will most likely be surpassed
@_date: 2018-05-01 11:13:09
Look.. it is deflationary cuz there cant be more than 21 mil btc... few milions are lost forever and the demand will be bigger and bigger over time. There are more millionaires in the world than single btc exists. And besides that central banks print milions every day... why do u think numbers increase year after year.. soon we will have steroid trillionaires ppl.

@_date: 2019-06-08 21:35:21
could be created by the banks but they cant dump it to 0 and it wouldnt be profitable for them either way.. lets say they have few mils of btc.. and btc goes to 200k.. they would sit on few hundred billion and they can control this asset class like how they control every other assets. they dont want to loose money its dumb to belive that. they would rather prezide over btc
@_date: 2019-06-03 17:48:01

@_date: 2019-02-10 19:06:39

@_date: 2019-06-28 19:52:05
first buy yourself a ledger nano s or a trezor. maybe you can find an bitcoin atm near you so you wont have to share ur id. check coinatmradar.com or u can use local bitcoins to buy from another ppl
@_date: 2019-06-30 20:14:43
owning most of the supply and controling the price.. just like gold for example. they will make the masses to use certain coins trough tv and social media. ppl dont have that much free will as they think lol. either way this is a new wealth transfer and we will benefit from it..but the masses im sorry for them cuz they will be even poorer.
@_date: 2019-06-21 19:32:29
wtf is with ppl going outta space hahah .. delusional and brainwashed
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:34:22
personally i think btc was invented by international bankers and i have few reasons. We all know that banks want to get rid of cash but ppl dont really want that. Globalism is a agenda that is pushed hard past years and one financial system for everybody is a part of that... but its a slow process. Ppl are trained to embrace the chashless society trough credit cards and more recently trough mobile paying apps.. and the next step is trough  descentralisation... by removing the middle man. In the end banks will change as we know em.. and they will adapt and they will control the major coins that masses will use so they will still be in charge. If u guys think the bankers are stupid u should check urselves lol... they dont control the world by being stupid.. and never in history normal people were in charge of the society and its very unlikely that will be different in the near future. another reason is that they have more to gain than to lose in the next financial system. Transparency of the blockchain its pure gold for the banks cuz they can see every transaction that happened, cross border payments that are fast and cheap is another reason. The only problem for them is that they wont be the middle man when somebody does a transaction... but they will still control this asset class by controling the supply.

@_date: 2019-01-05 15:08:44
u go there with ur btc on a phone wallet. u scan a qr code at the atm then u send the btc... after that u get the moneiesss. Maybe you will have to give ur details if u have to withdraw a large amont.. that depends on the atm. cheers
@_date: 2019-01-29 01:36:37
bro, we arent even in the acumulation phase so... relax for at least a year
@_date: 2019-01-17 17:58:43
or bitcoin its a trojan horse brought by the international bankers
@_date: 2019-01-18 09:37:18
What if they have few milions of btc untouched since the start. Who knows? I like btc and few alts. im just taking all the plots available.And deff im not stuck in that paradigm this world will change and we will make it a better place and everyone will be the owner of his money lol.

@_date: 2019-05-02 20:00:18
