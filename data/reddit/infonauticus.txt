Here I am yet again to post this fucking link.  
The report on correspondent banking, written in 2001 BY THE FUCKING GOVERNMENT OF THE GODDAMN UNITED STATES, acknowledges that most of the worlds drug laundering happens through the US financial system through something called correspondent banks. Basically, JP MORGAN, one of the listen banks doing this, decides it wants to do business in Mexico but does not want to go through the trouble of having to bribe all the people required to do business in mexico. So they go to Azteca bank and say " Listen bitch, you have paid the bribes and are already running. Be our vassal to launder drug money and you get a cut"  
Then money is laundered via these connections. This has been happening since 2001, and continues to this day as far as I am aware. 
They are not attacking bitcoin because of whatever reason they say because if they wanted to stop terrorist of drug dealers, they would look at correspondent banks. These are the same fucking banks that caused the subprime collapse BTW and got bailed out. Doesnt that bailout money seem like a good way to take liquidity and clean a bunch of fucking drug money into it?
Yet try to convince people to disregard hanlon's razor and people dont buy it. I law having rules I can quote as to displace the need to actually think and read. 
If you don't see malice in certain parts of your government, NOTE NOT ALL PARTS, then you are fucking blind
