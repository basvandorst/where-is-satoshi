GUI: change the offer book to BTC/alt coin (or at least the ability to do so).  
When scrolling over users that you have all-ready traded with, have the option to view that trade.  
Order cancel triggers: Automatically cancel an open trade if price drops/increases to a certain price.  You would lose your deposit, but it could help during times of high volatility which are often unannounced.

Can you tell which two keys were used to sign a multi Sig tx by looking at the outputs if you have the keys?. Probably, right?.

Bitsquare application works.  It is mostly SEPA (european banking), but some peers accept OKPay.  You are on your own signing up with OKPay, but I think they probably accept cc.

Anyone made an infographic or venn diagram or something visual showing all the different ideas, the people behind them, and how they relate or differ?  Just curious.

Thanks a lot. So funny feels like God just butt in on a conversation I was having with myself.

Thanks.  That is insightful.  
I think he's very smart.  Seems to me that he is not too concerned about the problem because he is not answering the question of today.  Tx fees don't mean a thing.  Miners are not incentivized by tx fees (my speculation) because they pale in comparison to the block rewards.  Sounds like he is trying to stay out of it for 100 years.  That's all right, but I'd love some rationality here, and I think he has an intelligent, compelling view on the topic.  
Please correct me where I'm wrong.  I'll reread it tomorrow.

I for one would be very interested in what Meni Rosenfeld has to say on the topic.  How XT would affect mining is very important, and it seems that many individuals are making claims about what it would do without having any real reflective thought.

You make the most sense.

Can confirm they're great and painless.
