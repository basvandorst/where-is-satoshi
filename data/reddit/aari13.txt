The average reddit user doesn't need bitcoin. Bitcoin needs an application that is highly relevant and compelling to the average reddit user.

See, you get how the world works. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 03:37:23
Currently, yes you are correct. In a year, you will no longer be correct.
@_date: 2015-06-16 01:42:29
Right? Main stream won't happen until there is a wildly popular service or function that people want to partake in and it only accepts bitcoin AND offers simple bitcoin acquisition.

Blockchain Token Certificate - BTC
@_date: 2015-06-10 23:26:54
No, it's not. You just can't build a viable business that derives it's profits from transaction fees. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 00:49:09
And 20,000 more retailers see 0 sales in BTC this year..

Only a sliver of society is cut out to be entrepreneurs, so yeah youre probably right, but it just mirrors the rest of global economy.

Yo! I'm in SA too! You ever make it down too geekdom? I'm doing my bitcoin startup there. 
@_date: 2015-06-26 18:07:21
And transaction fees? If transactions are so tiny they could easily be excluded from a block, right? 
@_date: 2015-06-16 02:38:53
Well, there's the slow way and there's the fast way...
@_date: 2014-12-27 20:20:21
So give them a perceived need use it. Why was silk road so big? You NEEDED bitcoin to participate. And people REALLY wanted to participate. So, we develop something that people feel that they need or very much want to do, and make it only achievable with bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-27 20:37:49
Well with a username like that there's surely no convincing you of anything with words. 
But what i'm getting at is that if we develop a relevant use of bitcoin to the masses that they simple cannot do currently with fiat, then we have created a need for bitcoin in their lives. A new 'invention' that changes the way people live their lives. Look at the major innovations of the past 30 years. Who needed a computer? No one, at least they didn't think they did, until they did. Or a cell phone, or a tablet, or a microwave or fucking memory foam. These all had dramatic impacts on peoples' lives and that's what we will have to do in order to succeed.

Odd, i've been purchasing from them regularly since about September. I know they are a very small staff and dealing with some growing pains. The hidden fee is troublesome though. 
Was this your first purchase? There is the standard 4 day bank transfer rate until you have enough volume to be eligible for instant purchase. Better than coinbase's need for a credit card, IMO.
Keep us updated. 
@_date: 2015-05-22 16:25:38
I wouldn't quite say they're full of crap. I've purchased a good $10k through them since Sept. There have a couple delays and one payment glitch but that's it. 
I'm surprised they offered an instant buy on 1st purchase! That's not normal. 
@_date: 2014-11-04 18:21:11
I've used it for 4 purchases so far and it's been great! And I can buy altcoins!

Too much for people who know the price of bitcoin. Your cousin's freshman friend in college that plays that stupid game during biology and spends $3 a day on in app 'credits' doesn't know how much bitcoin costs. Give her a reason to spend $ on it, and she'll buy it.

Boost.VC is funding companies in both these spaces, so I'd assume there is some intersection within their portfolio. Worth looking into.

Different users want different things. I dont care about storing my wealth, because I have none, just like the vast majority of ppl in the world have very little wealth. Giving them a place to put nothing is worthless to them. 
@_date: 2015-08-09 22:37:02
Or stop trying to explain bitcoin and instead rebrand it and develop applications that utilize it exclusively. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 17:57:29
Though further sustainable if you stop limiting it to a currency. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 00:46:16
Yes.  though the new business plan, website and MVP are not released yet. We're on our 5th pivot, but I think we might have a way to put the bitcoin userbase into the billions. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:23:37
Or they're artificially inflating the tx fees, which actually means MORE money for them vs just accepting txs now. Ppl who can, will just pay the higher fees to have their txs accepted.

Bitcoin is not on the cutting edge of crypto innovation. When someone needs a block chain to fit their needs, they MUST create their own. Their product's survival can't hinge on of the whim of the core devs when quick pivots are the norm. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:46:09
THIS IS LIKE A MOVIE O_O
@_date: 2015-08-12 18:25:36
Because a bitcoin service won't be viable until there are enough users to use it FIRST. 
So like I've been saying for a year now, concentrate your efforts on putting it in people's hands, not taking it away from them. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 02:38:21
I was up in FC a few days ago and Amanda at Sierra trading post told me about this place. I'll have to check it out when I'm back. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 04:56:45
Because nearly all the big VC money is going into infrastructure, and not concentrating on actual user adoption. There's this haze that so many bitcoiners live under and they can't see past their own obsession with bitcoin and notice that none of their reasons are applicable to the general public. When you can make bitcoin appeal to a high school cheerleader THEN you have a killer app. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 04:48:10
That's the plan. Keep an eye out for Jalapeño Games :)
@_date: 2015-04-14 01:32:24
Still requires ppl to want bitcoin. Most ppl outside this sub don't give a crap about bitcoin. The killer app will address that problem. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 22:01:49
 Did you miss the part about 75% of the mined bitcoin by these devices goes straight back to 21 and their investors? 
It's not just marketing BS for the $400 product, it's to build a mining farm for investors. 
@_date: 2015-04-02 19:14:30
Or proceed to fund a project that looks to create new bitcoin users, thus creating the potential for multiple times more money being put into bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-03-05 17:08:50
But gems doesn't have an existing user base. They have a POTENTIAL user base through telegram but in order for them to become gems users they have to understand bitcoin enough to want to use it. 
What wiper did is genius, because the user doesn't need to understand a damn thing about bitcoin except that it holds value and it works. 
@_date: 2015-04-17 21:20:17
They tried this at MIT and something like 30% of the students actually took the steps to redeem them. This model has good intention but like i keep saying, it STILL requires people to want bitcoin bad enough to go though the necessary steps. So, of the some of the smartest young people in the country only 30% were inclined to actually take the free bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 02:26:24
You sure? I think only about 90% of the trading volume is in china. No way that could affect the price significantly. 
@_date: 2015-03-19 13:26:03

@_date: 2015-10-30 18:14:32
its a misleading title. $1.6q in money flow does not equate to a $1.6q opportunity. The fee's skimmed off the top of these money transfers are the actual opportunity/market. 
Even then, you're reducing the market size due to efficiency and using the promise of that reduced cost to passed onto the consumer. 
@_date: 2015-11-29 10:25:45
Unless those single purpose chips pay back bitcoin to the manufacturer, whom also contributed investments in the $116 million round last closed...
@_date: 2015-03-04 15:56:12
Educating stock market traders on how to take money OUT of the BTC market. A trader doesn't care what the price does, as long as they can profit from its movements.

Hah! You have no idea...

We don't need more wanna-be currency traders trying to make a buck.

Because like all investors, they're looking for things to make money on. If open bazaar doesn't have a strong revenue model, then it won't get funding. 
They're more about profitable applications of bitcoin, than just novel new bitcoin tech.

@_date: 2015-03-05 15:13:21
This is big. 
An existing user base now has access to a wallet without having to do anything. This removes one barrier for entry for 10 million users. So now to address the remaining barriers. 
@_date: 2015-03-19 14:27:03
If i have anything to do with it, it'll be 500 million in 4 years. These projections are total BS. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 00:48:19
I think the killer app that will mainstream bitcoin will be the one that gets bitcoins to users most effectively with the fewest barriers for entry. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 09:55:26
You're close, but not quite.
