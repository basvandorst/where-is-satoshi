This kind of comment is often incredibly unhelpful as this particular thread could well rise to the top of a google search. So what you say may be true now, but really annoying in the future.
It's not uncommon to be told "just google it" to find that a bunch of the top results are similarly unhelpful responses telling people to "just google it".
Often it is much easier to just ask people who know on a specialized forum filled with people who have had similar experiences.

Well the motivation for someone sitting on a stash of bitcoins and craving mass adoption to write the post is clear. 
I'm not sure OP's motivation if genuine is as easy to imagine.
Loves bitcoin so much had to make a reddit account for it to tell a bunch of people who probably mostly already know all about bitcoin.
It just feels more believable that this is a regular here, creating an account to make it look like everyone is using bitcoin now.

Well I mean Euros should be valid all over Europe, and yes it's pretty obvious based on the design of the notes/coins. You may get German Euros in Greece and vice-versa. 
Invalidating Greek Euros would maybe be possible in that regard but would achieve a slightly different goal and penalize people who just happened to have Greek Euros in their pockets. Probably would hit Greece hardest, but it would seem like a crazy approach.

I don't know about that. Certainly not trusting banks, but people are trying to get their cash out of the banks before the banks take it. That doesn't mean they will stop trusting the pieces of paper. Just the people they give the pieces of paper to.
Not trusting banks might help to aid understanding of the need for bitcoin, but it won't reduce people's trust in the money itself. 
Well unless there is massive inflation as a result.

I'm not sure what you mean by this exactly, but based on your response I suspect you may be able to answer a similar question I have.
If you would normally be subjected to capital gains, but you use bitcoin as a means for remittance to another country, under what jurisdiction would it fall? Also where does the line get drawn between remittance and capital gains.
Example scenario:
Mine bitcoins in one country with capital gains taxes.
Years later move to another country (with similar laws and taxes), sending bitcoins to that country. 'Sending' is a strange term here, as they don't exist within either country specifically.
Sell on exchange in second country.
Presumably capital gain has been made. But in which country? My guess is nobody knows the answer to this question. But someone on hearing about it would be keen to make laws and legislation to capitalize on it.
This is similar to having savings in one country and remitting them to another country. But the gains if paid in the second country don't really make sense, as they were never owned in that second country.

It sounds like you think I think bitcoin is not a threat. I'm not someone who is worried about its volatility or price and I completely accept the arguments of not having the Fed, (alongside other non US-centric points of view) being a positive thing.
As I said in another comment. I'm just covering all bases, and just because what you've said is true, it doesn't guarantee there might not be some other problem with bitcoin and/or its adoption.
I don't personally stand on the side of believing bitcoin may/is likely to fail, but it doesn't mean it won't. There were a lot of competing protocols before the vanilla HTTP, TCP/IP web became the defacto Internet.
Anyway, to debate on these issues is really to derail the original intent of my post, which is more based on the premise that _if it is to_ succeed then wealthy individuals have little incentive to oppose it.

Being unemployed and saving money isn't dumb.
Saying that you are though, is. 
It's dumb because you're saying something that is very likely to trigger a predictable reaction.
You have to choose between
* being principled, getting on their radar and potentially missing a flight
* saying what you think they need to hear and having no hassle
It's not dumb if you choose one of those options.
If you prefer being principled and risking missing your flight that is fine.
If you prefer keeping quiet and having an easier journey that too is fine.
The dumb part comes in wanting the best of both worlds in a situation where that isn't going to happen.
Standing out as something that sounds like a drug dealer and expecting no hassle is the bit that seems to fly in the face of actually thinking about what other people think.
Is it hard for you to imagine their thought process?

I have read some incredibly long informative posts during my time on reddit and if anything all you are giving me is another good reason to ask.
If there is a book worth writing on the topic or a book out there, then I'd like to hear about it. If someone writes enough of a long, detailed response that it turns into a book, or inspiration for one, then that is worth asking about. If someone tells me about a book, then it is worth asking about.
Anyway, I'm not as interested in debating whether or not it's worth debating about this topic as the actual topic itself so I'll leave it at that.
@_date: 2014-08-04 22:29:02
Which is why I'm asking it. You or I may not be able to picture it, but that doesn't mean there are not far more knowledgable people out there who have pondered it at depth.
And the question that you use as an example, is actually a really useful question. Nobody would have gone to the moon (reference unintentional) if there weren't people asking questions like that.
People involved in the moon landings weren't in the habit of framing things in ways that were easy to relate to the ideas and capabilities of the day.
Paradigm shifts aren't going to be easy to swallow, and what I'd really like to hear is well considered opinions from the type of people who say we are undergoing a paradigm shift.
I'm not asking the average Joe here. I'm asking a huge number of people, some of whom may have done a thesis on this topic.
TLDR: Questions don't have to be easy to be useful.

I'm not sure where you get free from? 
Also I'm pretty sure the hub and spoke networks we have at present are not any where near close to as optimal as an inefficient connected graph network would be.
Definitely not as fast as driving directly yourself to complete a single point-to-point delivery, but certainly faster than having things sent to central depots.
Just to clarify, I'm talking about a hand-over time that is basically negligible in a drone network, rather than having a bunch of paperwork that people manually have to go over and scan or sort and organise. Basically an efficient routing mechanism all managed programatically.
@_date: 2014-06-20 23:43:30
Your question has much more to do with the nature of the internet than it has to do with bitcoin.
What you're talking about is just not possible. The internet is designed in such a way that even with the main Atlantic cable cut, the traffic can route the other way around the world.
The TCP/IP protocol is designed to just re-route traffic around non-responsive nodes.
The data would still get there. Slower, but still possible. You wouldn't experience internet blackouts at a continental level, just terrible slow service for various different websites and services. Including apps dealing with the bitcoin ledger.

@_date: 2014-12-29 21:25:53
Great, thanks for the comprehensive reply. 
A bit of a tangent, but I'm curious, and maybe you or someone is qualified to answer. So it seems like protocol changes will happen from time to time. Maybe to adjust the number of transactions possible for the network, the dust value, and splitting bitcoins into further divisions.
The thing that is nagging me, is everyone is so set on the idea that we can just adjust these things when we need to, but also that the 21 million bitcoins is a figure set in stone.
If we can easily enough update the protocol, then why can't we tweak the 21 million?
Not that I want that. I want to believe 21m is set in stone, yet dust values can change, or satoshis can be divided. It just seems that it's arbitrary which things can and can't be changed.
Could an organisation with enough money and power could do a 51% attack, double the block reward, up the limit of 21m to 42m, and pay themselves a 13m BTC bonus for doing so?
@_date: 2014-09-08 10:56:14
I second this, I owned coins in 2011 and sold them all for a small profit then bought back a fraction of what I owned for a lot more money in December last year.
Someone in 2011 advised me to keep half just in case. I definitely should have heeded that advice.

I think it makes sense to me, unless I'm missing something.

I'm not convinced that is true. I think a 100 to 1000-fold increase is a feasible change and people will still want to compare and refer to bitcoin in terms other people can understand. The price change may happen much quicker than society is able to catch up mentally.
It certainly will make bitcoin more important, and potentially more important than other currencies around, and it will be taken seriously by that point by pretty much everyone, but that doesn't mean that everyone will automatically grasp its actual value or convert straight away to speaking in those terms.
There's never going to be a straight line graph replacing the $/BTC graphs that just says 1BTC=1BTC even if it does become the defacto global currency.

Fair enough. Sorry I probably came across harshly and I made an assumption about something I thought you should know. 
I was with a guy that argued about the principles of taking liquids on flights, tried to take liquids on the flight then got pissy with the staff about the stupid rule and about potentially missing the flight.
Your story reminded me of that.

OK, but it doesn't sound like we can make any assumptions about how the JS ended up executing on his machine. It could be XSS or it could be malware. XSS could be thought of as likely because the attack vector is wide and the motivation is massive. Malware could be likely for the same reasons though.
It seems like any guess on likeliness is pure speculation though?
I'm not a security expert or anything though so maybe there's something I'm missing in the definition of XSS because as a developer I try to shield myself from having to learn all the details of these things by using well tested libraries that make it all invisible to me.

@_date: 2014-08-02 14:13:31
Well in the last case, I'm covering all bases and talking about the case where bitcoin actually isn't to be feared. I.e. we're all wrong here, and e.g. there's a fundamental flaw in the algorithm that ends up making bitcoin redundant/irrelevant etc. For example, the encryption mechanism gets cracked before a fix can be meaningfully implemented or something like that.
Or bitcoin simply isn't the next Internet or whatever, because fundamentally people don't find financial matters as appealing as cat videos and it just never happens to gain mass-adoption.
Not that this takes away from your point, I just wanted to clarify my unclearly stated position there.
@_date: 2014-08-29 11:46:54
Well this is exactly what I'm talking about. Had there been a consistent reduction then this 90 days that you mention wouldn't be an issue. People gradually feeling profit squeezes instead of sudden drops that could make expensive machines instantly un-profitable.
Part of me wonders if it's intentional to create price spikes resulting in further interest and speculation bubbles and generally increasing awareness of bitcoin.
Or it's like BTCisgod said and it's just simpler to build it that way.

*BY RUDYARD KIPLING*
If you can keep your head when all about you   
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,   
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
But make allowance for their doubting too;   
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:
If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;   
If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;   
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
And treat those two impostors just the same;   
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:
**If you can make one heap of all your winnings**
**And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,**
**And lose, and start again at your beginnings**
**And never breathe a word about your loss;**
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
To serve your turn long after they are gone,   
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,   
Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,   
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,   
And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!

I sold all 200 of my coins in 2011, making what I thought was a healthy £1,000 profit. Then I bought up a few at round about the all time peak prices (and through localbitcoins - so for more than market value even then) having regretted each subsequent increase in value.
On paper so far I've made ridiculous losses, but I can still see them trading for $40,000 to $100,000 over the next couple of years.
I just hope that that means they are worth what $40,000 is today and not as a result of massive devaluation of the dollar.

OK so most rational owners of bitcoin would not be valid candidates for that role.
What about the US Federal Reserve? Or any other controller of a threatened currency? Members of the banking sector?
Last I heard it would cost less than a few hundred million dollars to do so. Even if it's a few billion or trillion, it's the kind of money that could be (and is) dropped to protect the industrial military complex. 
2 trillion dollars completely unaccounted for goes missing and unexplained and you just get a few news articles and videos and conspiracy theorists complaining about it and it just becomes a gradually forgotten piece of history.

Sure, but if someone told you Bank A is the only bank that uses software that could be hackable in the future and they have no way of preventing it, how much money would you leave with them? It's only in theory until someone builds it, but once that happens thieves will be able to take all your money. 
Of course, Bank B are not vulnerable to this attack, and provably so. But until the attack happens I might as well leave my money in Bank A, right?

@_date: 2014-12-09 05:33:53
An aside to your point because I agree with the sentiment and the thinking behind it. "Devs should never deploy" just disregards a huge movement towards producing high quality software.
I think a better expression should be that "low quality untested software should never get deployed to production".
Trends that solve these kinds of issues
* Test-driven development
* Continuous integration
* Deployment pipeline and server provisioning
* Continuous deployment
* Smoke/sanity tests
* Feature flagging - switching features on/off for specific users/subsets
* Failover endurance testing with things like Netflix's chaos monkey.
* TDD - developers write tests before writing code. An automated test suite can be run at any point in time and guarantee that any changes have not broken the product. This provides more confidence in the correctness of the codebase and catches design flaws and most simple bugs early. Testing can include 
  * acceptance testing
  * system testing
  * integration testing
  * functional testing
  * unit testing
* Continuous integration - a separate server that runs all the tests each time changes are made and alerts to failures
* Deployment pipeline etc. You can use tools like chef and/or puppet to provision servers in a repeatable reliable way. The deploy process can use tools like this to guarantee the setup of a machine. Developers can work with vagrant virtual machines to have a machine that is exactly the same as production
* Continuous deployment - changes that pass all tests are rolled out to a staging environment automatically. No chance to forget a step of the deploy process
* Smoke/sanity tests. You can run full tests against production and/or production identical environments after code is deployed
* Failover endurance testing. By actively trying to attack your own production environment you can be assured of it's robustness.
Anyway, all of these tools lead towards one thing. Developers - i.e. the ones with the most knowledge and skill and ability to fix production failures have the most tools at their disposal and ability to fix problems as quickly as possible.
No amount of manual QA can detect all possible failure cases so the best thing is to keep the skilled people as close to the frontline as possible.
So **developers should deploy to production**. And as often as possible to prevent unexpected changes due to huge backlogs of features all hitting production at once.
But if you have a shitty system that has none of these automated processes and tools in place then you're right: No developer should deploy to production.

I've probably not thought about it enough, but can you explain to me:


For example:
I buy an iPhone from apple. I see about $5 go to multiple addresses, $400 to another and $300 to another.
Maybe I can guess $400 is the iPhone itself and $300 the Apple markup. Particularly if that address was used when I bought something on iTunes.
Maybe enough people can work out together who is receiving $400. 
Someone somewhere will maybe find a way to cut the middleman out of it.
Yes it's better for the market overall, but this is worse for Apple - the guys who have to actually implement it.
And maybe Apple isn't a great example because they'll have a ton of legal protections and contracts, so let's not get distracted by those details. It could be a lemonade stand. Or a car parts reseller.
Anyway, the people who are having their debts paid off efficiently, have work to do to implement it and no benefit, with potential financial privacy risks.
What would I as Apple, a lemonade stand, or a car parts reseller have to gain from implementing a complex payment strategy?

So bitcoins might work up to around a type III civilization at which point they may be brute-forceable.
@_date: 2015-01-24 08:22:08
OK that's the best answer I've heard.
So banks get away with money laundering, I'm not convinced that a cartel of banks or the Fed etc wouldn't be able to pull off the legal and technical maneuvering to  manage an attack against something threatening their existence, but we'll have to wait and see.
I think if there were a whack-a-mole situation then this in and of itself would be sufficient to significantly harm bitcoin.

It's really interesting but where's the incentive?
Initial thoughts:
So yeah, as a supplier I kind of want my merchant clients to do this because I get my money faster.
But the merchant who has to do the work of setting this up, just lost out.
* His financial details are transparent to suppliers, customers and competitors. Everyone knows his markup. And maybe who he gets goods from.
* Customers probably don't care, or don't want to care that suppliers are getting things quicker.
* Merchant loses out on interest for cash held in his bank for a month.
* Customer may skip the merchant if they can work out how to. They know his markup so they know how much they can save.
The benefits for the system as a whole are there, but they don't incentivize the right people?

I think that what we are seeing is that currencies don't take off easily or suddenly. Perhaps currencies take 10 to 20 years to take off massively. It doesn't leave much room for rapid, iterative improvements or smaller currencies to take a chunk of the pie easily.

I don't know if you are a developer, but there is a significant benefit to meeting (and working together) in person. 
Communication and empathy can be massively increased. 
A lot of the friction that exists in online communities doesn't exist or goes away when people actually meet up and socialize, maybe have a beer together, and understand each other.
It's easier to annoy each other and miscommunicate based on perceived tone and perceived intentions when all discussion happens online.
Now it's not always the case that people get on better in person than online. But if most of the developers haven't spent significant amounts of time together, then there is a chance that it really can increase camaraderie, empathy and general banter.
And if it doesn't it's not such a great loss to be in the same position as before meeting.

This is a typical experience. You are effectively doing the equivalent in terms of compliance of setting up an extra two bank accounts in order to escape the fees of the banking system.
I can't foresee anyway anything to do with bitcoin could be made easier in a lot of countries from the bitcoin side because of the KYC/AML compliance. 
As you said, now it's setup it's easier. 
I think from the bitcoin community side, the best thing would be to help guide people through the tedious process, and not imply that bitcoin is really easy all the time. If you have fiat, which most people do, then getting bitcoin and transferring to another country is a significant hassle the first time you do it. 
The more people go through the process, and then start to benefit financially in terms of reduced fees, the more likely it will be to spread. People will jump through a few hoops to save money, but in general people will take the path of least resistance.
The only other way it will improve is when people gradually start to earn, pay, hold, and keep bitcoin. Then it will be really easy all round.

If it's so easy to create a fake identity to get a bank account, then why not do as much as possible to protect yourself? Setup a fake account with an exchange, receive bitcoins, tumble coins, exchange coins for fiat, withdraw as cash.

Well having a place you can record balances/transactions and have people login/communicate etc is not really typical court/legal field area of expertise. Plus the E/J translation of every single message. 
You need bilingual people who also understand bitcoin, quite a specialist field, and one which kraken is perfectly suited to handle.

Don't have 3 hours spare right now, but curious about this. Do you have a summary of points he touches on?

There's nothing on the github links.
The first API request I tried on Services - Bitcoin pay
resulted in a 404
        
    Error 404: Not Found
    {
        "status": "error",
        "message": "No route found for \"POST /test/services/v1/btc_pay\" (from \"
    }
@_date: 2015-04-25 22:57:28
Then a 401 would make more sense than a 404. 
Also I'd recommend having dummy credentials for the API browser so people don't have to signup or email just to try it out.

I'd say technical and operational capability has to be the reason. Would you rather be communicating in Japanese likely via fax or post?

I'd appreciate you reading this and giving critical feedback on why it is no good: 
@_date: 2015-04-25 22:58:44
So you could put coming soon on each of them, or the whole section.
My initial (maybe wrong) impression was that nothing is finished at all.

You could take a look at ionic  as it targets both and uses web technologies.

It's more like bitcoin will take over fiat money like the internet took over printed works. Fiat money will still be around for a long time as will books and newspapers. 
They will become less relevant and probably printed money will be cool at some point.
But Bitcoin isn't the equivalent to Wikipedia. 
Bitcoin means to ownership and value what the internet means to communication.

So the site is currently 500ing, so didn't have a chance to go re-read it, but what is an example use-case for just having a hash of values on the blockchain? I can kind of understand actual storage, as wasteful as it may be, but not sure why you would want a hash of information that is separately stored elsewhere.
Aside from proof of existence type of applications I am just not sure what other usages there are?
@_date: 2015-02-01 21:32:08
OK the merkle tree is the key info I was missing. I've read about its usage in the blockchain but didn't realise it was also possible to prove funds are not assigned to other people, whatever that means in this case.
Interesting, I'll have to read about it.

The curl examples are the underlying RESTful API, right?
e.g. 
In general it is better to use a purpose built library in the target language built on top of a RESTful API. Or build one yourself. But underneath I'd be very surprised if it didn't conform to predictable RESTful endpoints.

You still have their word for it, unless you contact every other user and confirm they have checked their balance and can somehow confirm there are no other unaccounted for users.
Anyway, considering the recent news regarding gold, it doesn't look like a strong argument for proving solvency.

OK now I am not saying you have done anything malicious here, but people need to be really careful using others' code in this particular situation and setting an atmosphere of general-trustworthiness-so-it-will-probably-be-fine is exactly what trips people up when a bad actor comes along.
E.g. the recent 100% provably trustable gambling site that was only showing a seed when specifically requested. 
If what you are doing is completely legit and above board, then the responsible thing to do is to be completely open about it, show people everything, and insist that they themselves shouldn't trust people on the internet. 
And also to use an un-minified copy of the library.  I'd be doing that anyway if I were you. 
I mean, are _you_ 100% sure of where you got this? Do you think you should trust this minified library?
@_date: 2015-02-13 21:26:43
OK so I just don't know the answer to this. 
Just to also prefix that I accept what you say. It makes sense.
What is (the/a more) correct way to arrive at a valuation of a bitcoin if you were to consider it as having a likelihood of taking over a market?
So let's say bitcoin replaces 100% of the remittance market. Let's say that it is worth 200 million per year. Obviously we can't say bitcoin is worth 200m / 13m per coin.
As that is dollars per year per coin, and not dollars per coin.
So what is the right way to value it? Is there one? Can we even come close to guessing?
@_date: 2015-02-01 18:11:29
Proof-of-reserves doesn't prove anything other than how many bitcoin they control.
You don't have any idea other than their word for it how many they should be in possession of so what is the point of asking? Same for how much fiat they should have.
Not saying they shouldn't be accounting for anything but if I show you 1,000 BTC in a wallet you can't say whether I am solvent or not.

The fact it is minified js rings alarm bells

I love trezor, but as a technical person. I am not grandma. You are miles off if you think trezor is even close to facebook or AOL or whatever in terms of generic usability.
Generic grandma is going to be scared off by having to write down and protect 24 words.
24 words is far more usable than 128 bits of entropy, but even that stuff is a hard enough sell for the average user.
And I really mean average user. Anyone here reading and comparing themselves to their friends or peers is probably overestimating exactly who the average Joe is.
If everyone wants mass adoption, then they have to accept what mass adoption entails. It means explaining things and making things easy for the masses. The masses will adopt once there is a clear benefit and it is easy enough to do. 
All the rest of the time is going to be waiting. Waiting for people to admit that things like trezor, mycelium etc is nothing like AOL/Yahoo/Ebay/Google.
We are still in the pre alta-vista days.

Exactly. I calculated it something like 140,000,000 permutations. Have to write scraping software/copy paste all the posts/read the API docs, write a program to generate and try permutations. Move the bitcoins once you have them. All for a few dollars. 
I mean I know exactly how I can take those bitcoins, but by the time I've done it someone else might already have them anyway and I've spent hours working for $20.
Even calculating the permutations probably wasn't worth my time.

If the bank owes $250m and I check that they at least have my $200 how do I know they have everyone else's?
They could show $100m in reserves to me in person and I could count it, but I still don't know that they actually owe $250m.
