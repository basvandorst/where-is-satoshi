Nice one Michael.
@_date: 2015-12-13 20:05:26
I've alerted support.
You should hear back today. 
Thanks for your patience and sorry for the trouble.

SEC does not file criminal charges. However, they may refer the case to DoJ to file criminal charges (IANAL however).

If you have a bitcoin (or blockchain) startup, or even just an idea, Boost provides a great environment to develop it and get mentorship. Apply, do it.

Integer overflow or just bad validation (accepting negative numbers).

No. But you should try to be in the US/SV for the duration of the program.
@_date: 2015-12-02 09:04:16
Most likely, it has to be due to taxes and/or reporting.

Yup -- it's an auction. There is no guarantee of winning. We're just trying to open it up to more people.

[Celery]( is an alternative, but it too requires multiple days.

Understood. I should have posted from the company account. Please see the blog post and tweet.
Contract will be available soon.

When we designed Celery (a coin buying service), we had the exact same problem.
In fact, we had to design around it -- the default buying page in Celery has fixed quantities for people to buy.
So I agree with you. Using bits by default, is a common workaround.
@_date: 2014-06-16 13:46:08
Edit: Correct. $100 per bidder.

What would an example in which Roger could renegotiate this in a 'Chinese' way?
@_date: 2014-06-16 17:23:34
We determine the group bid based on the client bids (volume weighted average). So we can't 'lose on purpose'.
The $100 is the operational cost of processing a client. Remember we have to do more than just accept the bid; we have to post capital for the initial deposit, verify the identity of the users etc.
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:46:25
Your best bet is to [call SecondMarket](
Of course, you can buy small quantities from Celery, Coinbase, Circle.
@_date: 2014-08-11 04:32:18
And info on 'active' wallets? Active being, say, those who've logged in the past month?
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:11:23
It's not a crazy idea. It makes sense. We need more people to have access to this auction.
We're putting together a group bid. Take a look: 
@_date: 2015-01-18 02:58:05
I can tell you why: Fraud.
This is true at least in our (Celery's) case. There are a lot of stolen identities/bank logins etc. The recent [coindesk article on credit card fraud]( is a good read. It applies to bank account debiting (ach etc) too.

Do you need the ability to buy / sell? If so, look [at how to buy bitcoins -- it includes wallets]( 
Otherwise look [at the bitcoin.org web wallet section](
@_date: 2015-01-05 15:16:26
Need to get clarity on HOW they got hacked. If it's a bitcoin 0day for example, more people need to know.
@_date: 2015-05-20 17:15:48

Alright, let me look into it. I'll PM once I have a build.

Thanks Michael!

The 24h change is calculated on a near real-time basis so it will be different from the ones calculated by places like coindesk.

The sudden drop makes the app even more relevant, just sayin'
@_date: 2015-08-19 01:12:04
Right; this thread is about the app tho?!
@_date: 2015-08-19 01:11:34
Makes sense, and is easy to do -- noted, thanks!
@_date: 2015-08-19 20:28:16

could you please shoot a mail to help (reference your reddit username if you'd like); it's not appropriate for us to discuss or share your personal order situation on a public board.
@_date: 2015-11-10 21:51:05
just checking in -- we have no outstanding orders still waiting for a response from the submitter. Did you get your issue resolved?

Hello all -- I'm work on Celery.
Couple of things: 
We've had issues with a portion of our orders where we couldn't acquire the coins at the initial order price. We're offering full refunds for those orders or the current price. This is within our rights as per our terms but we still hate to see this happen. 
Look, it's not great situation for us or our customers; we're working hard on our tech to make sure this is eliminated in the future.
Also, no one is getting goxxed; if your order is late (this happens to a bunch of customers if the ACHs don't get cleared on time), you'll get the coins. If you've been our customer for any significant length of time, you know this can happen. Right now the estimates are fairly dumb -- they need to take time of order placement into account (ACH cut-offs), which is something we're working on. Keep an eye out for order completion emails.
@_date: 2015-03-06 18:03:23
There are other places to buy/sell. Celery for one.
@_date: 2015-03-03 00:13:38
I'm getting the same error.
"Cold wallet maintenance in progress. Please reattempt after 5 hours."
@_date: 2015-11-10 15:59:33
Did you email help Could you share/PM your initials? I think there are only 1 or 2 users in the entire system still waiting to get this sorted. Let's get you squared quickly.
EDIT: You are welcome to start more threads; it's best to contact us directly however.

Last I tried (a month or so ago), it took me 3 days to fully sync. Also, I had restart a daemon a few times because it would get 'stuck' and slow down syncing to a crawl.
I haven't used it, but 0.10 is supposed to have headers-first sync to alleviate the situation. If you can, give it a shot. 
@_date: 2015-03-15 09:55:03
The minimum is $10 at [Celery](

It's the security and usability see-saw. They chose to be slightly on the more secure side.

What an odd way to do withdrawals. Anyway, email sent. Will update if there is any progress.
@_date: 2015-02-09 18:28:00
ACH costs less than 4.9c / transaction.
Current cost is $0.0030 or less/tx. See: 
Of course, what you and me pay at the bank is entirely different.
