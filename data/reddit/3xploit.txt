Here is probably why they stopped taking it. They were probably using something like bitpay that moved away from a % based fee structure to a monthly fee. That monthly fee is high as shit though. They pitch it on the premise of "saving on tx fees" but in order to save you need to process ALOT. So if not many folks at these establishments are using BTC, they will drop it. If they knew there were alternatives then they would take it

@_date: 2014-04-11 00:19:36
I seriously doubt it was a "brute force" attack.  It probably was a heartbleed exploit. Brute Force attacks typically do not work unless those guys password to their server was something astronomically idiotic. Standby...I am gonna see if they patched heartbleed.
They have patched heartbleed.  But if somebody changed your worker names then they probably only had a database breach.  I suspect this for two reasons.
* 1)  I am sure all the values of worker names changed at the same time which typically is done with a SQL command
* 2) You were still able to cash out. If people had access to the server, then they have access to the wallet, which  I would assume they would obviously try to get the crypto.
Check out my pool.  pool.finalhash.com  If you want to make an account on there I will disable your fees. Just pm me your username.

Gavin you are speaking well outside of your knowledge base now bud.
@_date: 2015-05-24 00:28:39
I know you want to get cocky when you dont even know me but that is fine. When i spoke about mining being more than just a easy to understand sector of bitcoin here is the "Enlightenment".    
    
In mining all the big boys ALWAYS talk. And generally even though we are all in competition with each other it is a kind of nice place to be because yes we all want more hashes but we also know that helping each other out sometimes means more money for everyone.   With this mentality in the big boy arena of mining we have many considerations to make outside of yes, blocksize is good because of xyz and no blocksize is bad because of xyz. The social complexity there breeds some really interesting scenarios especially in china.    
In china money is not king despite what you thought you knew by watching a few vice documentaries.  However, cash is definitely a top priority.  But when i said explicitly i thought Gavin was reaching it is because to miners, it is not a simple yes or no. We need to dig deeper into how it affects many things like network propagation and mining times and the list goes on. But outside of what most people think they know in the mining world, it also has alot to do with unquantifiable things that we as large scale commercial miners feel is important in our realm. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 19:46:50
NICE! have $.5 on me, bucketofpurple! @_date: 2015-05-23 02:43:18
Gavin does not have the needed knowledge base for going on like he did in his blog about block size and miners. The situation is not technically complex it is more of a socially complex issue. He does not know the mining game well. Period.

@_date: 2015-05-11 08:06:59
@_date: 2015-05-24 16:34:27
however creating smaller blocks is NEVER in our interest. As the network scales up and block rewards diminish then the only way that we as large scale miners can ever hope to profit is from having large blocks to shove more transactions into them. However, increasing fees is also another way. 
@_date: 2015-05-17 21:10:30

@_date: 2015-05-23 13:04:46
Honestly, i see the issues both ways. The network needs to scale but there are two schools of thought. Peter Todd stayed over at my new place last week and this was all we pretty much ever talked about. Peter personally feels that we can not raise the limit but put something on top of the blockchain that helps out. He was not sure what that was, though. Also I would never think that a static variable in any code that is planning on scaling should ever be used. EVER. I mean why does that even make sense? So i guess the changing on blocksize has two subsets of thought. Hard limit and dynamic limit. TBH idk why Gavin wants a hard limit out of ignorance and a lack of caring to do the research. He may have a good reason, i've just not taken the time to ask him about it.     
Now to answer your question yes I would agree.  All the core devs, i'd say with the exception of Luke, do not have hardly any experience mining, and most of them would admit that if asked. I frequently get emails asking for advice or help or what have you.    
Overall my take is this.  I don't generally get involved in development on bitcoin unless either asked or somebody is reaching and needs that hand slapped, which is the case here. I am all for an open discussion and honestly, i dont lose sleep over it mostly because i know all the core devs, no matter how dysfunctional or crazy they seem, i know they all agree on doing what is best for bitcoin. i KNOW that.  However sometimes folks need to be reminded that an open and FAIR discussion needs to take place and to have people stay in their wheelhouse for knowledge points to counterpoint objections of new ideas.

This analysis is slightly off. FinalHash has set up many Chinese farms. Nobody pays 8 cents. Nobody with significant hashrate that is. Most pay under 7 cents. Also the s4 is not the most efficient there are several miners that are not publicly available. So I would say this estimate is not a bad start. But my numbers show around 28%. Good ground work.
@_date: 2015-01-04 06:05:51
FinalHash for the record has officially pulled out of the competition do to having too much other crap going on. FYI. We are in china too much and really cannot devote the time necessary. This was decided last month for the record.

this actually has some truths and some close truths.    
The gov. does not own the miners. The only part of this that is true is that you are forced to sell power back to the grid at .38RMB unless the farm is directly on the damn property. And 4 chiners miners is not 57%. 4 locations that are shared by over 11 miners do though.

So when these guys tape out chips, they will underclock the piss out of them and say, "Our chip CAN run at an efficiency of xyz" However, generally the $/gh at that level dont make sense. So yea your chip CAN run that efficient but you would never ACTUALLY run them at that speed because it is cost prohibitive. Hopefully that clarifies. These guys just use it for marketing.

To further the counterpoint, from a professional miners standpoint, everything in this post is 100% true and accurate except the first and fourth.

As a large scale miner myself, here is a question. Most large miners are known. And known well. There are a few shadow players but I'd say about 15% of net. How do you feel identity revealing makes bitcoin better given the above statement?
@_date: 2015-11-20 14:11:25
Yes it is centralized. But that is not always a bad thing. July 4 fork was fixed with the phone calls. That's powerful. Additionally, miners are supremely disincentivized to break BTC as it were. Large capital investment and so forth. Or datacenters are not even what I would call a tier 0. So if BTC blew up, we have infrastructure outside the obvious miners machines that is useless thereby blocking a business pivot. Further centralizing I don't see. I could see centralizing floating from party to party though. I.e. BTC guild pool used to be huge, no it isn't mind of thing. Of course centralizing could be a problem, but I are bigger incentives for us not to. Most of the big pile are known decently well, just hard to contact. But many of the Chinese miners will be in Hong Kong. I encourage you to still agreement if possible. If you do attend I would love to meet up. As I said, huge fan of your videos

So ill bullet point answer
* This is basically a two part answer. The pools that ALSO have mining gear generally sell 75% of their coins. Chinese in particular. BF does in fact NOT hold all their mined coin. That is utter bullshit. And you can quote me on that if you want.  However, pools as pools generally hold. HOWEVER! pools that run PPS (INCLUDING 21... yes their bullshit payout scheme is in fact PPS) must retain a good amount of coin to counteract their variances in block finds.
* Antpool's hashrate is growing for a few logical reasons that i cannot discuss here. But you can read between the lines perhaps.
* When you say constraint, no. I think constraint defies the very nature of what we are trying to do here. Bitcoin really is IMHO a "Have your cake and eat it too" revolution. But pools that offer low fees get more customers. 
* Chinese gov.... no. Look into how business works in china.
Catch me at scaling and i can provide clarity

So here is the cool thing. We have a deal with cryptsy so selling the coins is on a market maker fee and Betarigs is eating the cost of that super small fee. And then you will be able to push betarigs miners through mintsy and vice versa. So win win win. $1 @_date: 2015-03-07 21:30:31

We wont resuscitate for free. Bitcoin is like a patient with a crap HMO insurance plan. "DNR" is on bitcoin's wrist band. If we screw it up, that is it. I promise you this my friend. All the professional miners have sound business models. However, was correct in assuming that miners will TEMPORARILY mine at a loss. In fact many are at this very moment. Just in our nature. We have a huge risk profile so we tend to speculate on the price. However, at some point, the power company comes knocking for their money. And they most definitely do not take bitcoin. So in a few more halvings, here is the choice, pay a marginally sub credit card level fee. (on the order of 1%) or die. We as miners have several "irons in the fire" as it were to help subsidize ourselves, but at some point, bitcoin will have to subsidize ourselves.

As a professional miner, fees are most definitely and always will be IMHO negligible. Too many people say stuff like, "Bitcoin Is Free" for this to change. For more info see my talk at scaling bitcoin montreal.

Hey there. In general, cloud mining is more expensive because you pay for the convenience. In a properly run set up, you can mine with just one click. Additionally, most "cloud mining" set ups are scams. 
The only service I know to be 100% legit is Genesis Mining because I have been to their datacenters. Also they post proof of their datacenters with live video streams and all of that. I believe they take credit card but will hold payouts for 30 days due to cc fraud stuff.
Other than that, you may want to just try by purchasing a cheap miner to get the hang of it first.
If you have other questions feel free to PM me.
Good luck

Overall, i think you are out of tune with what REALLY happens in the mining world. We have tools in place to clear stuck transactions, and no the alternative to losing 100K of scrapping miners is well, turn your machines off and wait for the price to go up. Nobody will mine for free. IDK how you get that notion from anything. Miners are at their core selfish. No matter who tells you different. However, i suspect there is no way to change your mind because you know everything about bitcoin mining. So have a good day?

OK let's simmer down now.  I am the CTO of cryptsy. Here are the facts. If u don't log in for a year idk if u dies, got knocked off by the NSA or what. So the coins do in fact move to our offline storage. U may ask why? Here is why. If your account becomes compromised then that is on me! I have a duty to protect your shit. What's the best way to do that? If u just have coin chilling I'm moving it to cold storage. Then you go on to say I'm obviously stealing coin because the issue needed to be escalated. Firstly, when you speak to our support team, these folks are customer service pros. Not tech pros. If you went into best buy right now and asked a cashier how many gigs of ram does this iPad have, they would say idk. Same thing here. If I asked them how do you move coins from hot to cold they would say, call Mullick. So, we r not interested in stealing coin its just counter productive, b follow common sense and it will show you some things.
