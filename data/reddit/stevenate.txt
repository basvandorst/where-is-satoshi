Great gift! I cant help but think how funny it would be if, when you tell him about the seed, he says "Oh yeah I found that a while back - how do you think I bought all those video games throughout high school?!"

He bought 100 dollars worth, man. I spent more than that at target earlier. People on this sub are so fucking dumb sometimes.

It is just because there are so many college kids who "invested" a hundred bucks and think they are awesome by not caring about their unrealized loss of slightly more than that. Anyone who put actual money in, whether they can afford to lose it or not, would not be happy at losing potential or actual profits.

More like "only invested chump change". Even if you can afford to lose a few grand it obvioisly isn't a great thing.

its crazy how badly your own brain will try to trick you during those first couple months. I remember thinking stuff like "oh man i made it a whole week without smoking I deserve a nice ciga... wait god damnit..." 
Congrats and great idea with investing the money
