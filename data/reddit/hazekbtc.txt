Hi, I work at Bitstamp. 
We do not have any general issues with either sending or receiving bank transfers to or from our customers. The OP's issue is an isolated and individual case pertaining to their company alone.

I can confirm the message posted in the OP as authentic. We are going to scrap our current anti-spam system, which works but may cause delays, in favor of withdrawal fees. These fees will only be the fees which will be added to the Bitcoin transaction. We do not plan to charge any additional fees on top of the Bitcoin transaction fee.
@_date: 2014-07-21 14:04:37
This depends, if you mean malware that would replace the Bitcoin address when you want to copy paste it into your Trezor supported wallet then the answers is no, as the Trezor has a display and you can confirm where you're sending your funds.
But if you mean malware that would alter how a website is displayed to you, I don't know, if that is something is possible then yes, this is still an open vector of attach.

1. transactions are instant, confirmation are what takes time, and for small amounts those are not needed
2. fees
3. this one worries me as well, but we're fine right now and there is a lot of work being done to fix it so it's likely solution will be found
4. pools are voluntary, miners can switch if a pool turns out to be malicious which is impossible to hide. What is more problematic is the trading of mining shares, i.e. people funding a business to buy hardware and pay them dividends because this business is removed from all the costs of getting a certain hash power under their fingers and couldn't care less if they use it in a self destructing manner.

Apples to oranges. You can't compare the cost of paying of a mortgage vs renting because as a homeowner all the other expenses of maintaining your house fall on your shoulders while when you rent none of them do. Owning is hardly cheaper when you account for all the other costs.

Empirically it's still just an opinion then, correct? Btw there are many cultures around still today where this opinion is radically different, particularly in the middle east or Asia. Are the people who rape from these cultures evil? Are you willing to say they're not? I'm really curious what is the answer. Because obviously if you have a methodology that can make these distinctions I would very much like to apply it to the state and see where this gets us.

@_date: 2014-07-20 18:54:43
I sympathize with those people, but I don't see an alternative way of more efficient and more importantly ethical market regulation. Btw it's not like these people who got burned weren't warned that the business they were willing to give their money to was not using best practices and that they were exposing themselves to significant risk. We can therefore assume they were willing to expose themselves to this risk for the chance of significant benefit, they were not forced to buy anything. Sorry it didn't work out.

You are wrong. The detail you forgot is that it is the longest proof-of-work chain of valid blocks which contain valid transactions. If all the miners start producing the longest chain which is not valid according to my client, my client will ignore them and wait for a miner to produce something my client considers valid.

2 problems:
a) people generally lack the savings necessary in order to hold of the spending of their mined bitcoins
b) holding bitcoins over such a long period of time is highly speculative and could mean loses instead of gains

@_date: 2012-12-02 23:12:56
What is a "request for payment"? Could I still send and receive bitcoins without one?
@_date: 2012-12-13 01:38:47
There is no free way to get bitcoins. You either sacrifice your computer + internet connection + electricity to issue new ones or you offer goods/services in exchange for them or you simply buy them. But bitcoins aren't free, partly that's why they are valuable.
@_date: 2012-08-27 09:34:27
Here's a good explanation of what I mean with Bitcoin's utility: 
@_date: 2012-10-22 10:14:04
* To your first point please read this post by Trace Mayer on bitcointalk: 
* To your second I'd say that you miss how jobs going abroad has a lot less to do with globalization and a lot more to do with the FED printing money and the States running a huge trade deficit. When it's more profitable to export your out of thin air created currency than goods, normally the jobs will go too.
* To your third point I'd say that being backed by a violent force is not a prerequisite for people to be willing to use it if it's superior to it's alternatives, quit contrary, history shows many things were sought and used despite a large violent force forbidding it and enforcing this arbitrary rule through violence.
* And to your fourth point I'd say you are making conclusions that aren't backed by reality. The reality is Bitcoin is a young experiment and we have no idea yet what will happen.
@_date: 2012-10-17 21:13:41
Wow, this is awesone, especially for those wanting to buy some bitcoins because there's a new record amount of available bitcoins being sold there!
@_date: 2012-11-03 00:14:40
I didn't say it was important.. But it does give us a decent indication how far along the adoption curve we are.
@_date: 2012-11-28 15:54:27
I'm actually slightly emotional, congrats everyone!
@_date: 2012-08-29 20:28:50
HAhahahahaa xD
@_date: 2012-11-23 00:08:26
From what can be seen it looks like good news driven speculation but there's a lot that we just can't see with Bitcoin, so who knows.
Short term it might be a small bubble but long term I don't think it is.
@_date: 2012-08-10 00:42:14
Double cool! xD
@_date: 2012-10-29 23:21:26
The answer to this problem is to not hold bitcoins for any period of time but simply exchange them for fiat as soon as you get them. There are even services like bitpay.com that specialize in this and make it beyond easy to implement. Conversely you can implement hedging strategies that insure your holdings vs sudden exchange rate drops for a small fee.
@_date: 2012-12-05 20:54:38
check  maybe you can find someone in your local area willing to trade for cash, but generally people are highly wary of accepting payments that can be charged back because Bitcoin transactions are irreversible and it's an easy way to get scammed.
@_date: 2012-10-29 22:02:01
That's ok. I see this as a war and the more they misunderstand Bitcoin the more mistakes they'll make when they try to fight for their relevancy.
@_date: 2012-12-30 20:32:32
Actually this argument deserves no debate. One merely needs to open their eyes to see right away that the position the OP argues does not match reality and is therefor meaningless.
@_date: 2012-10-23 00:12:18
How can you possibly know anything then if it's all just a figment of your subjective thought?
You can't have it both ways. You either accept there are some thing we can know about what it is that we are and where we are or you're basically just trolling and there's no reason why anyone should pay any attention to you.
@_date: 2012-11-09 01:01:09


If by this you mean stick a gun in other people's faces and force them to follow my arbitrary rules and force them to let me rob them of their wealth, then that will never happen I'm afraid.
@_date: 2012-12-03 16:23:26
I'm sorry this happened to you but bitcoins are grownups money and you need to make sure you know how to address security issues. Unfortunately if your account got hacked there isn't anything anyone, not even mtgox, can do about it. The safekeeping of your login information is your responsibility and due to how Bitcoin works, transactions are irreversible.
Next time please make sure you use a unique password and two factor authentication by using either google two factor authentication or a Yubikey - learn more about it here:

Btw I agree with their definition of fiat money:


Meaning bitcoins are not fiat even though they are arbitrary. But the sentence right after this definition is at best disingenuous:


I guess they left out the gang of thugs with guns that will force you at gun point to let them rob you of money that they demand must be denominated in their fiat money.. /rolleyes
@_date: 2012-09-15 16:40:00
How? It couldn't be simpler, start selling goods and services for Bitcoins, find foreigners who will want those goods and services and want to pay with bitcoins.
Unless of course exports are limited by the gang of thugs that rules over them i.e. their government.. :/
@_date: 2012-10-25 21:44:58
Bravo OP, that was truly beautifully written! Too bad the small gang of thugs more commonly known as the government rely on violence rather than on reason making your message irrelevant :/

bitinstant so far has been highly reliable so I'd wait for them to answer your ticket.
@_date: 2012-08-30 16:19:41
Yeah you pretty much need to be a computer scientist and a mathematician in order to completely understand precisely how it works and I don't think average people will ever really understand nor do I think they need to.
What you should understand is that the project is open source and what that means and that it started in a community full of skeptical geeks like myself who understand exactly how it works and wouldn't use it if we didn't think the algorithm was sound. For example when I discovered Bitcoin last year in February I spent a whole week just posing various question to the devs before all my concerns were answered and I felt I can trust it to work as described.
EDIT: you might also find these videos helpful: 
@_date: 2012-11-04 10:04:32
Because some people value convenience more than the value in their ewallet. Personally I have two wallets, one where I value the convenience more than it's value and one that I don't, the former being an ewallet and the latter an offline wallet.

$20 to $30 isn't rising in value, it's exploding in value and yes, people don't want price explosions followed by price crashes so it's no wonder they down vote you.

Well this sucks but it's also irrelevant to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2012-12-20 02:00:22
They can be - it's up to you.
@_date: 2012-11-29 10:42:51
No it's not a problem, it's a feature. They clearly keep most of user coins in cold storage to ensure they can't be stolen. If you're going to use coinbase you should want this.. The delays is just a small price to pay for increased security, that's all.
@_date: 2012-12-09 16:48:58
Because your client is likely still synchronizing with the network by downloading the blockchain (the entire transaction history of Bitcoin). It cannot know which addresses have how many bitcoins in them until it finishes this and is up to date.
@_date: 2012-08-05 09:04:17
Yes, sure, but you can't test bars like that, and it's usually the bullion bars that scammers put tungsten in since coins are too small for that.

You are one more peer in the network with a copy of the blockchain and even though you cannot affect what transactions miners validate, you can affect what YOU validate. This means that contrary to popular fallacious beliefs YOU also have a say in what is a valid block. If YOU reject a block because it contained something that broke the rules YOU agreed to by running that specific client it gives YOU ability to later on reject any transactions that are based off of that block. Even if some miners validate them, YOU and others like you will refuse them and so maintain the rules of Bitcoin in your version of the blockchain. 
Of course this means that in order for the Bitcoin you agreed to use to continue there'd have to be some miners that would also reject those blocks and validate transactions under the same rules you follow which would then create a hard fork in the blockchain.
This is the reason why even though some would like to compare mining to voting, it really isn't because no one can force you to accept a block that follows rules you didn't agree to. And no one can force you to accept new rules that would constitute to something else than Bitcoin as long as you can find at least some peers that follow and validate transactions under the same rules as do you.

It depends, I have no idea how long it takes with the current 0.7.1 version with the old database and without ultrapruning that's coming with the next release. I think I remember various reports of 1 day and up to 2,3 days.. With the 0.8.0 test build with the new database and ultrapruning it took me 12,5 hours.
Blockchain.info is running the Bitcoin client on their servers so you don't need to download the blockchain but you do give up a bit of security by using their hosted system instead of having it on your computer.

It is. 
Because when new dollars are created by the FED they aren't created and evenly distributed among all holders of all the dollars already in existence. No. When the FED does that big banks called primary dealers and the government get those new dollars first and can go into the economy and extract goods and services before prices readjust because of the increased supply which means those holding dollars gained no new dollars but the prices of things they need/want to buy have gone up.

@_date: 2012-11-14 21:21:15
No. 
I mean just think about it, do a mental experiment and try to figure out what sort of consequences such an action would have? First of all, only slightly less than half of all bitcoins that will ever exist have been mined so far, so obviously they can't buy the ones that haven't been mined yet. Secondly only about 150k BTC are on the market for sale right now and if they bought them all the price would skyrocket. Essentially there isn't enough money to buy all bitcoins because the more they'd buy the higher the price would go. This is also why a free market will never completely deplete any resource because the price of the last few units always becomes infinitely expensive.
@_date: 2012-10-22 13:37:05
First gold can also be theoretically "hacked" once we develop the technology to synthesize precious metals ( and 
Second it's arguably far easier to get such a technology than it is to get enough computational power to hack bitcoin in the sense that you hack it's encryption protocol for which some have made calculations would require a computer more powerful than all energy of stars in our galaxy combined or some such ridiculous number.
So what you are saying simply does not exist in reality.
As for Bitcoin's success, it's arguably already successful, and anything more than it's current success will be just a bonus.

Yeah it would be a total waste because they can't really be tracked. I mean they can see where the coins go, but after the first transactions they can't possibly know it's still you who holds them and is doing the transactions. As long as you make a few transactions in between the transaction you are concerned about your privacy over or use a mixing service you are as safe as you can be. For added security use bitcoin with Tor (google it) to further hide your identity.

Why do people buy new cars? Why not wait 2 years when the same model with the same features and maybe 30k miles used will be 60% of the original price? Or take any other good for which the price trend over a long period of time is down like electronics.. Why do people buy new PCs? Shouldn't they all wait a couple of years because then they'll be cheaper?
Look. It's simple, what you're referring to is a:
**fallacy** - sually an error in reasoning often due to a misconception or a presumption. Some so-called fallacies are not rhetorically intended to appeal to reason but rather to emotion, or a more nuanced disposition. An informal analysis of rhetorical patterns in fallacies should not be confused with rigorously formal arguments in logic, because rationally persuasive arguments require neither to be successful.
It's as simple as this: people will still buy stuff because they have to eat, they have to shit, they need a roof over their heads, they need to move from A to B, ect ect ect and falling prices will just be a bonus to all this activity.

Your bitcoins may get stolen if someone is able to gain access to the private key corresponding to your public key i.e. your Bitcoin address in which your bitcoins sit. It is what allows you, the owner, to create a transaction, so keeping that private key safe and secure, which if you use the Bitcoin QT client is located in your wallet file, is paramount.
Bitcoins usually get stolen when someone fails to do so by either getting tricked to share the private key in their wallet with someone else or by getting infected by malware that steals that private key.

Pretend you have 100BTC and you want to sell them. You look at the market, you see the highest bid is $10.5 last price is $10.55 but you're not happy with that and think your 100BTC are worth more so you place a $11 ask.

Exactly. If there is need for more currency it will be introduced by splitting up the current supply into smaller units (shifting the decimal point to the right) which means new currency will be evenly distributed among all holders not like central banks do today where governments and big banks get the new currency first and rob everyone else by being able to spend that new currency before prices readjust up.

If you mean that the processing power behind Bitcoin isn't doing anything useful you are mistaken, it is what allows it to securely operate in a decentralized manner (first of it's kind in the history!). But if you mean that Bitcoin isn't doing anything useful I can't see how a payment system and a currency which allows you to send some money to anyone, anywhere, anytime within seconds and at almost no cost as useless.
All in all, the market disagrees with you, and it does so at $12.5 a bitcoin.
@_date: 2012-09-23 19:45:38
Let's see:
1. Right now? $1 USD gets you about 0.0819 BTC
2. Three ways: 
a) you mine them, google "Bitcoin mining", but this is a specilized industry now so unless you have expensive hardware I wouldn't bother
b) you sell goods and services for bitcoins
c) you find someone who'll sell them to you for your fiat money. There are websites called Bitcoin exchanges where people buy and sell bitcoins and fiat currencies:       ect ect ect
3. There's only one way, you need to have access to a Bitcoin client. Now you can either download the official client that will require you to donwload the public Bitcoin ledger that's 4GB large and growing, you can try a custom feature rich Armory client that has the same requirements, you can use light clients Electrum or MultiBit that connect to a server in order to get that public ledger or you can use an eWallet which is basically a site, much like paypal, that runs a version of a bitcoin client and you don't have to install anything just create an account with them, like  or  Which you decide to use depends on what are your needs security and feature wise.

And there is none and I also doubt it would mean deflation especially not in the short term.
It all comes down to supply and demand for sale. Were those coins destroyed then removed from the supply for sale or were they never really part of the supply for sale? If they weren't I can't see how the exchange rate could possibly get affected. Perhaps in the long run coins would get worth more since if someone was saving this huge amount of coins and then they eventually spent some and added them to the supply for sale the exchange rate in that case might have decreased instead.

We still don't have a paypal type easy to use and yet very secure feature rich online wallet yet.. I'm mean coinbase is trying to do something in that respect but I don't regard them as being very secure because I have to give up my control of my bitcoins if I use their service, plus competition never hurts.
If you really want to do something awesome, improve upon the coinbase concept.

Because I deeply value my freedom and want to live in a free and propserious society therefor I will NOT ever support any measure that steals from people. What you condemn as hoarding I hail as a virtue and call it prudent saving. I will never support anything that would ever punish or steal from anyone because they are prudent.

1.) you can always invest in mining by buying shares in mining operations on glbse.com which is accessible to anyone
2.) if you don't like how Bitcoin was designed, you can always start your own alternative crypto currency with a different model of "distribution" and I'm sure if your's is so much better the market will eventually start to gravitate towards it

Your order of how you plan to give the presentation is flawed. Please watch:  and start with the WHY's first, then move on to how and what..
I'd start off by appealing to the general frustration with the current financial/banking/government world, illustrate a few of the most obvious structural/systemic problems and then present a case for Bitcoin being able to solves them. Once you're done with this part and they bite the bait, then and only then should you move on to the technical aspect.
You might also consider watching this educational panel to learn what kind of questions people have when they first hear about Bitcoin: 
@_date: 2012-09-04 23:33:17

@_date: 2012-08-07 10:59:18
I have a sneaky suspicion it might turn out that those holding significant wealth in bitcoins might decide further down the road that their wealth would be best protected by running their own bitcoin mining operation even if they were to mine at a loss.
Say MtGox estimates that less and less miners can for what ever reason still mine profitably and are probably going to shut down which they predict could affect their profits. Well if the cost of running their own miner even if at a loss would be less than the estimated extra profits they could continue to reap because of stable mining, they might as well decided it's worth it and run their own miner at a loss in order to run their entire business at a greater profit.
@_date: 2012-11-27 15:58:49

Bitcoin is the highway and bitcoins  are the cars same as paypal is the highway and dollars are the cars. Bitcoins i.e. these cars may or may not be regarded as either a commodity or currency.

use of “real” money, thereby also reducing the cash needed to conduct the transactions generated
by nominal income. In this regard, a widespread substitution of central bank money by privatelyissued
virtual currency could significantly reduce the size of central banks’ balance sheets, and thus
also their ability to influence the short-term interest rates. Central banks would need to look at their
existing tools to deal with this risk (for instance, trying to impose minimum reserve requirements
on virtual currency schemes).
Oh how I hope they are fighting a losing battle on this issue.

A most excellent interview, highly recommended.
@_date: 2012-08-05 22:27:36
I think, given that you're from Germany, your best is to make an account with  (3rd largest exchange) and buy your bitcoins there.. It's a Slovenian exchange that supports SEPA deposits and automatically converts EUR into USD(basically free) which then get credited to your account so you can buy bitcoins.
Then I'd create a wallet account on  and store your coins there.
@_date: 2012-11-22 20:55:11
hmmm That's actually an interesting thought experiment. I think the right answer is we don't know because we don't know what we really are, what what we call reality really is, ect. 
But if I'd guess, I'd guess that since I think the reality is determined following cause and effect, it could be you are right and it will "never" happen or it could be it will happen 5 times. So yeah I think you are right and "Not necessarily" is correct as it can possibly be.
@_date: 2012-08-10 10:10:55
teaearlgraycold, these will answer your questions:
@_date: 2012-12-30 20:29:22
OP.. your concerns do NOT match reality. If they did, no one would EVER buy a single computer or other electronic device that gets cheaper and cheaper year over year.
A fixed supply is not a problem because bitcoins aren't edible, can't be used for shelter, can't be used as clothes and can't be used as a number of other things and services people want/need. There might be more saving then there is today where savers get punishes by being robbed through inflation but it wont be a problem. Quite the opposite if history is any indication (read up on the industrial revolution and the monetary system back then) it will be even better than things are today!
@_date: 2012-12-30 21:07:18
You are misinformed.
Of course cheaper and cheaper computer parts are analogous to an ever appreciating currency because in both cases a person can gain value by letting more time pass. In the first case they gain more value because the computer parts get cheaper the longer they wait in the second case they gain more value because purchases they make cost less currency the longer they wait. And you are right, if one wants to feed themselves, find shelter and clothing or fill the need/want for whatever else, they would need to spend their bitcoins which invalidates your position.

I'm sorry but there's no quick answer to your question, you will just need to sit down, take some time and read the contract you signed with paypal/mc and see if it would violate it. If it would, then obviously you can't do it, if it wouldn't there's obviously no good reason not to do it.
Maybe even hire a lawyer to read the contract, just to make sure.
And if you're free to do it according to the contract and they mess with you anyway, well then you have grounds for a lawsuit. (btw I'm not a lawyer so this is just me stating my opinion based on common sense)
@_date: 2012-11-08 13:24:59
Among the things already pointed out you also forget that some people who offer a service and rake in a nice profit that depends exclusively on Bitcoin functioning and functioning well, for example people like the owners of the mtgox platform.. these people might be willing to mine even at a loss if it means they can keep higher profits when combining the mining loses with the profits of their service.

I think you're confused. Read what happened here: 
@_date: 2012-11-09 10:31:01


What happens is exactly the same as what happens right now when there is a service and more than one service providers. Some people pay the provider A and some people pay the provider B and some people pay the provider C and no one is forcing anyone to go with the provider they themselves picked. And if a provider for what ever reason (lousy service, uncompetitive prices, old tech, ect..) can't get enough votes (profits) he goes out of business.
That's how a market regulated by strictly consumers i.e. a free market solves the problem of disagreeing people.
@_date: 2012-09-02 20:27:38
Ahahaha those are funny, a few bitcents sent!
@_date: 2012-09-18 16:27:47
The wallet is held encrypted on their servers, when you go to their website and want to open it what actually happens is that code downloaded within their page on your computer in your browser locally decrypts the wallet and then you can operate with it. Once you are done this same code, which btw is open source and peer reviewed, encrypts your wallet and sends it back to the server. You can even do this offline as long as you loaded their page and downloaded the encrypted wallet before you went offline.
The weak point here is that someone or even the site operator himself replaces the site code your browsers downloads with malicious code that then after decrypting your wallet may steal it from you. In order to somewhat defend against that you should instal blockchain's javascript verifier: 
Since people like myself do use this verifier and since the code for the server and the client side is open source it's likely an attack would get quickly spotted and people could get warned on the forums, twitter, facebook ect rendering the attack almost worthless.
So you see, blockchain.info actually is very secure. If nothing else it's secure enough to at least hold your day to day spending money.

Unless Jack's counterfeited USD were indistinguishable from the real USD making them one and the same, his fake money would get discovered and no one would sell their BTC to him.
But even if he could acquire a large number of BTC, I really don't understand how what you describe he may attempt to do would make things any different than what they already are? We already have volatility, we already have scams, we already have businesses that just that get robbed or something else and leave their customers hanging or simply pack up and vanish so I really don't understand how much "worse" someone with a lot of BTC could make things in the Bitcoin world.
Not to mention someone would need to be a complete idiot to hold a large balance of money and then actively pursue strategies he thinks will destroy it's value. That just simply isn't done.

@_date: 2012-12-14 11:36:14
You call it spin but the reality is it's a conclusion based on empirical observation. I am following Bitcoin since the exchange rate 80cents per, since back when anyone hardly knew about it. I am extremely vocal about it in several communities I frequent that praise themselves as being rational and thoughtful and yet you can't even begin to imagine how many times I've ran into extremely vocal opposition that wasn't even willing to look at my arguments, to look at the evidence or to try it out. No, what they did instead is they held on to their preconceived fallacies like their life depended on it and dismissed anything I had to offer as nonsense.
And yes, I agree 100% about making Bitcoin easier to learn, I personally have done some work in that regard and will continue to do more. But what good is it if Bitcoin is easier to learn if a person refuses to learn?
And there's no spin this, these are the facts.
p.s.: And you also misunderstand my posts as a rant because I'm perfectly fine with these lazy intellectually dishonest people missing out on Bitcoin. They don't need to change, they can go extinct. 
@_date: 2012-12-17 22:49:31
Bitcoin is pseudnonymous. 
What this means is that unless someone declares they control a specific address no one can find out who owns it. And what this means for you is that if you send your bitcoins from the address A that you have publicly in some way associated with your identity directly to say address B that is also publicly associated with say wikileaks, then there's no question what happened. But you don't have to send your coins directly and you don't have to have just one address. You may have address C, D, E, F that no one knows you control and perhaps you sent those coins to those addresses first and then to the B address associated with wikileaks. This way someone may see your coins ending up with wikileaks but they can't really know if you sent them there or if you sent your coins to someone else who sent them there unless they get your wallet file and see that you also control those other addresses. 
Also you can find mixing services which do this automatically and do it even better where your coins end up somewhere else entirely and coins you wanted to donate to wikileaks come from other users of the mixing service to further obfuscate who is sending what to whom.
@_date: 2012-12-14 11:17:27
It's NOT that the majority is incapable of understanding it, but they are lazy and intellectually dishonest and refuse to put in the time and effort to learn about it and some undoubtedly are too stupid despite putting in the time. Heck even I struggle with certain aspects because I can't read the code and so I have to rely on logic and reasoning a some assuming in order to have a coherent picture in my mind.
These are the facts and I'm sorry if listing facts is self-righteous, obnoxious, and repulsive to you.

Unfortunately Tom Woods isn't yet willing to deal with bitcoins which is somewhat disappointing. If I remember his reply to my comment on his facebook wall correctly he said he'll accept them once he can step into a store and spend them there.

Because there's risk involved which you don' take into account. Yes they are wroth it unless bad stuff happens. So people who want a guaranteed profit will rather sell them and have others take the risk of owning them.
Not only that, Bitcoin is 100% transparent and so it's virtually impossible for anyone to hide something regarding the network and since you can't hide you "own" the network and you know in advance if people found out it would create a huge negative sign that would get reflected in the exchange rate, you know it's a stupid move and you don't do it.

Basically it's difficult to get bitcoins because Bitcoin transactions are irreversible so anyone selling them is only going to sell them for irreversible fiat which excludes paypal and credit cards.
So if speed is your goal I'd try  if I were you.

Your assessment likely isn't wrong.
But you miss one crucial thing: risk. It's easy to point out the upside and forget that while someone might profit immensely by holding bitcoins they might also loose their shirt if they happen to fall in their value. 
With risk is how the reward comes, and that's the only way it should be.

It's tied to the blockchain which everyone has a copy of. 
You see, if your block that you found doesn't have the right properties such as the right hash result then it gets rejected by the rest. So your client might not readjust the difficulty to the current level but then when you validate transactions and issue new bitcoins through "mining" your blocks would just get ignored, so you have no choice but to adjust the difficulty to the current level if you want to make sure you're not just simply wasting electricity..

People hate it because it exposes them for what they really are: lazy and intellectually dishonest and in many cases just plain old stupid
People fear what they cannot understand and there's no doubt about it, you need a certain level of intellect to be able to understand how Bitcoin works and more importantly why it works the way it does. And when people can't "get it" they get pissy and throw a tantrum just like a spoiled brat would when he's not getting the candy he demanded from his mother in the supermarket.

Yep. My comment there:
"In addition, this commodity becomes an attractive choice for speculation — people will acquire Bitcoins for the sole purpose of later selling them at a higher price, without any intention of actually spending them to buy goods or services."
This is just retarded. I'm sorry to start with an ad hominem but what else can I call this part? How can anyone argue people would want to own something because they speculate it will increase in it's value never intending to actually spend that value? Why the fuck own it in the first place then? Just to look at it once it's really really valuable?
Of course not. Those who'd save (yea yea, you'd want me to call it hoarding wouldn't you?) would eventually reach a level of savings that they'd feel comfortable to spend some of it on their wants/needs. Not to mention you can't eat or drink bitcoins, nor can bitcoins provide a shelter for you and keep your warm and safe meaning there's always going to be some amount of spending no matter how badly you'd want to save your pile of ever appreciating currency.
Man I'm just grateful we don't really need to argue this point endlessly because we have a real life experiment and I hope this matter will be sorted once and for all in a decade or two where all these fallacies and sophistry get put to rest.

@_date: 2012-12-12 22:19:06
This is a bit complicated so bare with me. I'll explain it with an analogy:
Imagine that every "Bob sends 1 bitcoin to Alice" transaction is an envelope. Bitcoin mining is is listening to the Bitcoin peer to peer network for any new envelopes flying around and gathering them. At the same time you're gathering all these new envelopes you're trying to bundle them up into a package and tie a nice bow on it. To tie a bow you have to solve a math problem, and the solution to that math problem is the fabric that will give the bow the right shape, a shape everyone else in the network will recognize as following the rules of Bitcoin.
So. Many people are doing this, they are gathering all these new envelopes(transactions) and trying to tie a bow on a new package. Who ever is first to successfully tie a bow on the next new package, gets to send this package to everyone else in the network. They also automatically insert their own special envelope that isn't coming from anyone and is addressed to them with a reward of X bitcoins (was 50, now is 25) for doing this and that is the block reward and it's how all bitcoins are issued.
When the rest of the network receives his package they check the bow and the contents of the package and if the package looks like it's following the Bitcoin rules they add a copy to their chain of packages they already received and if it doesn't they simply ignore it, hence why no one can cheat in Bitcoin and issue themselves more bitcoins then allowed by the code.
Then everyone tries to bundle up all the next new envelopes that aren't included in any of the packages yet into a new package of their own trying to add it to the chain of packages and thereby starting a new round of competing for the reward for successfully doing so.
**The reason this is done so is because Bitcoin is decentralized.** If you have a central authority that keeps track of all the envelopes(transactions) you don't need this complicated system. But because Bitcoin is decentralized this is the only way yet discovered how it can work and it actually works very well. Instead of a say post office keeping track off all the envelopes making sure they follow the rules and deciding how much new bitcoins are issued, everyone part of the network is doing it, and everyone is issuing the new bitcoins through this lottery of trying to tie a bow on the next new package and add it to the chain of packages which everyone shares as a way of keeping track of all the valid envelopes.
I hope this makes sense, if not I'll try again.
@_date: 2012-12-28 12:54:38
Good idea. Write about how painful it may be for some who dismissed Bitcoin in the beginning to swallow their pride and start accepting it and how are they going to go about it?

This is a popular misconception of what actually happens.
Banks do not create money, they just make their debt extremely liquid while pretending it's 100% liquid. And this is what gives the appearance of money creation. The truth is it's just a psychological effect experienced by the oblivious depositors.
What am I talking about?
The money that's lent is not created.. No! That money exists and was deposited to the bank. It's the depositor which made the deposit on demand and thinks and acts as if his bank is only safekeeping his deposit that has the appearance of money creation. If the system was upfront with their depositors how it really works.. that their deposits on demand are in majority actually being lent as investments, depositors would know their bank doesn't actually safekeep all of their money and may not be able to repay at some point.
The scheme is however difficult to identify because if any bank at some point could not repay, most depositors would get made hole by the government. And even the above 100k depositors may get made hole if the central bank gets involved and lends into existence currency to bail out the bank.
The consequence of this scheme in the real world however is that the on demand depositors act as if their bank can always repay at any time in their economic transactions. This is what gives an effect of there being more money in existence but in reality, mathematically, there isn't.
Money creation happens only at the central bank.

I think it's likely that the newly discovered bitcoins are less likely to enter circulation and therefore keep the supply stable when the difficulty rises without a price increase than if there's also a rise in price. So in a long period of price stability and simultaneous increase in difficulty miners likely get very close to the profitability threshold at which point they have the option to either stop mining or to save and sell bitcoins at a higher price later. I think saving and selling later is what's the preferred route hence the temporary constant supply which with a rising demand yields a rising price.

Yeah, if the last copy of the corresponding public key holding the bitcoins is lost (read deleted or forgotten) there's practically no way to ever "find" it again and hence there's no way to ever again spend those coins.
In fact, some people have determined a few public addresses that they are almost certain no one owns as sort of digital wishing wells and started sending coins there knowing that no one can spend them.

Run the [Bitcoin-Qt]( client and make sure to open and forward the 8333 port. This way your computer will act as a transaction and blockchain validating node in the peer to peer network. If a miner should add a block with a transaction that breaks the rules, you're client will ignore it and not relay it and the more nodes do this the hard it becomes for someone to cheat.

No issue at all because that side of buying bitcoins is regulated by governments.
The issue is the security of your bitcoins which are best kept safe in your own hands on a paper wallet. All I suggested was that you first get a couple and toy around with them, try and set up a paper wallet, figure things out, ect.. and then when you know what's what I'd do what I did, sign up with blockchain.info for a hot wallet and have paper wallets for your savings wallet.

Because when you need to spend a portion of a paper wallet you'd want the change to go to a new paper wallet for security reasons so if you it in smaller chunks maybe the change is small enough to just send to to your spending wallet and you don't have to bother with moving the rest of your savings to a new paper wallet.

In times of economic hardship caused by a depreciating currency people rush into anything they think will preserve their wealth. In the time when the Dinar hyperinflated in Yugoslavia people rushed over the northern border to buy Austrian Schillings and German Marks..

So yeah, I do believe some people would rush into Bitcoin, for example it certainly makes sense for Venezuelans already today.

But as far as I understand r/anarchism that bunch is no friend of rules and no friend of freedom and certainly no friend of private property and that's all that matters to me. Just read their info: "Anarchism is a social movement that seeks to abolish oppressive systems." Seeks to abolish? Or rather destroy no matter the damage..

@_date: 2013-01-02 00:01:43
You are one more peer in the network with a copy of the blockchain and even though you cannot affect what transactions miners validate, you can affect what YOU validate. This means that contrary to popular fallacious beliefs YOU also have a say in what is a valid block. If YOU reject a block because it contained something that broke the rules YOU agreed to by running that specific client it gives YOU ability to later on reject any transactions that are based off of that block. Even if some miners validate them, YOU and others like you will refuse them and so maintain the rules of Bitcoin in your version of the blockchain.
Of course this means that in order for the Bitcoin you agreed to use to continue there'd have to be some miners that would also reject those blocks and validate transactions under the same rules you follow which would then create a hard fork in the blockchain.
This is the reason why even though some would like to compare mining to voting, it really isn't because no one can force you to accept a block that follows rules you didn't agree to. And no one can force you to accept new rules that would constitute to something else than Bitcoin as long as you can find at least some peers that follow and validate transactions under the same rules as do you.

It happened in a period when the classical gold standard was used and prices consistently fell through several decades ( So either that meant people were as you'd want to call it hoarding and the industrial revolution happened despite that or they weren't hoarding.
In either case it disproves those who predict economic decline because of excessive saving which according to them will happen with a currency that consistently gains value because as history shows either it will happen and it isn't a problem or it wont happen and therefor isn't a problem.

My reasoning is that as long as Bitcoin stays decentralized and without a central authority, centralized layers on top of it aren't going to be a problem because a market regulated strictly by consumption i.e. the free market will always find the best solutions that offer the most privacy and the most transparency.
But again, I'm not saying I support the block size limit staying as it is, I support Bitcoin staying decentralized without a central authority and sound arguments have been that lifting the block size limit will eventually destroy that. If however solutions come that include a dynamic limit and innovations come that keep Bitcoin decentralized despite an ever growing blockchain, I'll be all for it.

1. I'm glad you admit you don't think I own my property, it explains a lot (btw what's your address so that I can come take yours from you since if you want to be consistent you don't own yours either, or does this not apply to you?)
2. I guess there's nothing wrong with mafia then either? Since they are a superior force and they come and break your legs if you don't pay for "protection"? 
Just because there are people who may steal my property from me does not mean that I own my property only if I or someone else defend it against every such person. I own my property because I either found it and cultivated it or because I bought it from the previous owner. Ownership has nothing to do with the ability to defend it the property.

Even just running a full node does a lot to keep Bitcoin decentralized because you are one more node that keeps the full blockchain stored, that checks and validates all transactions being broadcasted and that checks and validates all new blocks being broadcasted.
If you run a full node there is no way for the rules to change without you knowing about it through your full client and having a saying about it even if you don't mine.

First, I didn't propose any solution. I just relayed the facts surrounding the issue.
Second, I am going to support the solution for which sound arguments will be made that will keep Bitcoin decentralized without a central authority which is my primary and only concern. Btw I already use centralized services on top of Bitcoin, voluntarily might I add, and I don't mind. And if I ever need increased anonymity I'll use one behind Tor.

Bitcoin is a first of it’s kind technology and is the only way one can:
- instantly
- without having to pay enormous fees
- without having to worry about fraud or currency debasement
- without having to ask anyone for permission
- without being obligated to identify yourself
- transfer any amount of wealth to anyone, anywhere, anytime.

You're not going to get attention for using Bitcoin alone, at least I can't say I've heard of such a case and I'm very involved in this community for almost 2 years now. But all Bitcoin transactions are public that means that if you attach your real world identity and send it to someone else who attached their real world identity to their address than everyone and their grandmother can see this.
So the trick is to not attach your identity to your address. One way to do so is buy bitcoins with cash locally at  or once you bought them at an exchange and want to send them somewhere you don't want people to know about you use a mixer service like  that offers anonymous transfer to break the tie to your identity.
And that's pretty much it.

Bad news is there is a lot of drama happening on the forums right now between devs themselves and also the community about the issue of the block size limit. It's a limit on how big blocks can be and therefor on how many transactions on average can be confirmed per 10min. Currently Bitcoin has a hardcoded rule that limits this number at a theoretical max of 4200 or 7 tps (transactions per second) which many argue is not enough for an affordable payment system but others argue promotes enough fees to cover security and ensures the blockchain is never to big to force out too many nodes and significantly decrease the decentralization of Bitcoin. Changing this rule would cause a hard fork which could have all kinds of repercussions and keeping this rule could also cause all kinds of repercussions.
So yeah, we're not without problems.

Murder is bad is subjective because the concepts good and bad are subjective, nothing about math is subjective..
A far better approach and a lot closer to math (when making up what a crime is) is by setting an objective goal for yourself; mine is to live in a society which is free to maximize it's potential. This is not a good or bad goal, it's just something that appeals to me. But the requirements to reach this goal are not subjective because reaching the goal can be objectively tested and therefore the requirements can be objectively determined. So for my goal the requirement is that in order for an entire society to be free to maximize it's potential, every individual member also must be free to maximize their potential and in order for an individual to be free to maximize their potential they need two things, be free to live and be free to own and absolutely control their life, body and property.
And there you have it, objectively the conditions which you can then use to determine what a crime is or what is bad - meaning everything that goes against those conditions. But those conditions work only with my goal in mind, someone else might have an entirely different goal.. :)

All bitcoins are owned by having been sent to a Bitcoin address and this transaction having been recorded into the blockchain. The blockchain is the backbone to the Bitcoin money system and without it there are no bitcoins, just random numbers. But in order to issue, own and trade bitcoins one must have the ability to insert a transaction into the blockchain which is only possible if very strict rules are followed, something that is validated by the entire Bitcoin network.
One of these rules is that in order for bitcoins to exist they must have been sent to a Bitcoin address that looks something like this: 15j781DjuJeVsZgYbDVt2NZsGrWKRWFHpp
But if one wants to spend those bitcoins, the rule is that they must create a valid transaction and a valid transaction means that they must provide a proof of ownership, a proof that is very easy to produce if one has the private key (PIN) to a corresponding Bitcoin address but practically impossible if one doesn’t.
So ownership of bitcoins constitutes of:
- bitcoins existing attached to a Bitcoin address recorded in the blockchain
- the ability to produce a valid transaction to be inserted into the blockchain by having the corresponding private key
Put simply your wallet file is merely a file that contains to your Bitcoin addresses corresponding private keys that one must have if one wants to spend bitcoins sent to those addresses. And you secure your bitcoins by keeping your private keys, well, private :).
A paper wallet achieves this by having the private key not be stored on a computer that can be hacked but instead is only written down on a piece of paper.

It's so sad how financially illiterate most people are. Because that's what this is.
How else could someone confuse a ponzi with a money system? There's no one promising a return, no one claiming there are no risks speculating with bitcoins? There's no one who would automatically receive the money new users spend to get some? And plenty of people already lost money on bitcoins which is widely known and recognized by everyone. Simply baffling..
And yet this is the reality. The best that can be done in the face of this reality is to recognize it, educate those willing to learn and just go on with our ways. Eventually necessity will be the strongest motivator which will convince even the most illiterate. That's when they'll have to change or they'll go extinct and I'm fine either way.

Bitcoin's use case for the average person is it being built upon the following 10 principles:
1. FINITENESS - unlike the infinite possible supply of fiat currencies the total supply of bitcoinsthat will ever exist is forever arbitrarily limited and fixed2.
 
2. TANGIBILITY - issuing new bitcoins requires labor in the form of finding a specific number bysolving a cryptographic mathematical problem3.
 
3. TRANSPARENCY - all Bitcoin transactions are public and forever stored in a transaction logcalled the blockchain which anyone can read and examine4.
 
4. ANONYMITY - all Bitcoin transactions are only between cryptographical pseudonyms withoutthe need to have their owner's true identity revealed5.
 
5. SECURITY - all confirmed Bitcoin transactions are with mathematical certainty irreversible, allbitcoins are with mathematical certainty non-counterfeitable6.
 
6. DECENTRALIZATION - Bitcoin has no central authority and is voluntarily run by consentingautonomous peers in a peer to peer network7.
 
7. SELF-OWNERSHIP - only the owner of a pseudonym gets the password to spend his bitcoinsin effect making them his property unless he chooses otherwise8.
 
8. INTEGRITY - all bitcoins are counted equally(are fungible), virtually can’t be frozen or blocked from being spent9.
 
9. PRACTICALITY - Bitcoin works anywhere, for anyone, non-stop, and the protocol allows formany practical layers on top, just like email, http..10.
 
10. RATIONALISM - the Bitcoin software is written under the MIT open source license and is notanyone's logically inconsistent intellectual property but merely organized informationeveryone can use as they wish
If you haven't yet, you'll learn soon enough why your fiat toilet paper, which lacks these principles, is oh so much inferior to Bitcoin for just about anybody to use.

It's called mining more as an analogy because bitcoins share some properties with gold.. but what it really is is the validation of Bitcoin transactions and the issuance of new bitcoins in a decentralized way.
Miners as jesset77 already explained a bit are bookkeepers. They constantly devote their computer hardware, internet connection and electricity to being connected to the Bitcoin network of all the users and they listen and gather new transactions and while they do so they also check if these transactions are following the Bitcoin rules. As a reward for their work (this takes a lot of time and electricity) whenever one of these bookkeepers adds another entry into the public ledger called the blockchain it's per Bitcoin rules that they may issue themselves a certain amount of bitcoins.
To keep this process of issuing contained and adhering to the from the get go decided limited amount of 21million bitcoins that will ever exist, one of the rules is that in order to prove these "miners" are actually doing the work and following the rules they must compute a mathematical function over and over and over until they randomly find the right result that everyone then checks. Who ever is the first gets the reward and if rewards are found too fast the Bitcoin software readjust the difficulty of that mathematical function in order to maintain an average constant rate of a new solution every 10min.
And that's what is mining. It's this really innovative method of a financial incentive for providing the security of a ledger in a decentralized fashion.
Once all bitcoins are mined the incentive will be comprised of transaction fees(currently super tiny) that the "miner" who finds a solution can scoop up.

BTW anyone who read the full ECB report knows that what all these claims by reporters that the ECB is somehow worried about competition is nothing but an outright lie.
What the report actually said is that if Bitcoin became widely used they, as arrogantly self proclaimed guardians of economic stability, could face angry constituency if a problem with Bitcoin should lead to economics problems, a constituency that might blame them for inaction before those problems arose and that it is in this regard that Bitcoin potentially endangers their reputation.
Of course this is bullshit, but that's what they really said and not what all these reporters are saying while taking bits and pieces out of context just so they can conjure up some sensationalist title that will get more views.

What happens is pretty much like if you were sitting in a school classroom full of your classroom mates and a teacher. And because you are "coded" to hear and understand only English, when a French exchange student sits next to you and starts talking to you in French, you simply don't understand what he is saying and so you ignore him, and so does everyone else in the classroom. You don't need the teacher to control you and tell you to not talk with him, it's because you and the French exchange student are communicating under different rules that no communication can take place. Same goes for the Bitcoin peer to peer network and it's why the rules can't change. If someone would do so, they would simply get ignored by the rest.

There is no rule about how many transactions per time unit one can send. 
What there is however is a rule on how big in terms of memory can a block get and be considered valid by the peer to peer network and it is limited to 1Mb. If you divide that by the minimum space the data of a single transaction requires and divide that between the on average 1 block per 10 min you get a limit of 7 tps, but this is just a theoretical limit since transaction data often takes up more than the minimum required so the limit is actually worse than 7 tps.

Thanks for the tip!
My answers:
1. I don't really have a good answer for this but I speculate it's for two reasons. First they don't realize just how scarce silver really is because the supply picture is distorted by a fractional paper market. And second I think perception of the past few decades isn't the easiest thing to shake so they falsely believe it's a bubble already and they don't want to find themselves "holding the bag" as they say.
2. Price is highly likely suppressed and it's not profitable to do so right now. Also the same reasons apply as with 1.
3. He probably is therefore you need to do your own research and verify the facts.
@_date: 2013-07-07 18:06:01
Can Bitcoin in it's current form even handle such a volume of transactions?
@_date: 2013-06-06 19:18:12
Yes, if we had private law that is exactly what you would need to make those acts illegal. But something not being illegal does not mean it isn't wrong or that you should just stand by and let it happen, just like something legal doesn't mean it's right, or even worse just like something being illegal doesn't mean some people wont do it. 
Personally I think if someone does attack you in any way(you, your wife or your property) you should defend yourself with any force necessary.. even if what they are doing isn't illegal. 
Do you see the distinction I'm making here?
@_date: 2013-02-28 16:40:17
It's like reporters don't even do any research anymore. They just look at the latest facts and the rest they take from past articles instead of investigating for themselves. I mean how else can anyone still write, for BBC no less, that the price of bitcoins was near zero at one point in 2011?
@_date: 2013-01-02 18:56:05
You don't really need to wait for 6 confirmations. 0 confirmations is already fine in most cases and 2 should be plenty the vast majority of the time. What 6 confirmations does for you however is gives you an even greater security assurance with regards to a double spend attack. As the number of confirmations gets higher it just makes it more exponentially less likely someone has pulled off a double spend attack vs you and at 6 confirmation this chance just gets so small it's virtually meaningless, that's why 6 confirmations.. 
In other words it's just a practical rule of thumb for increased security.
@_date: 2013-02-15 12:00:16


That's a bit misleading, more accurate would be to say that the Bitcoin client won't accept an address that isn't a valid Bitcoin address and changing a letter will mostly likely make it not a valid Bitcoin address.

Bitcoin is a brand new technology that gives you the ability to:
- be in full control over your finances at all times
- define how public you want your ID information to be within a transaction
- protect yourself from anyone being able to freeze or seize your money
- receive money without having to pay any fees
- practically eliminate the risk of fraud via chargebacks
- preserve your purchasing power through ensured limitedness of bitcoins
- send any amount of wealth to anyone, anywhere, anytime without having to ask for anyone’s permission
Bitcoin is important because it represents:
- freedom
- honesty
- progress
- complete control over your finances
Basically there’s nothing on this planet that comes even close to it an if you care about any of this then you should definitely care about Bitcoin.

Correct. Actually lag is a funny word, it's more the sequence. So even if the order is matched instantly it's still entered into the order book (obviously) at the price someone picked and shown through the API as one of the new open orders. It then depends on anyone reading the API how they interpret this. If people only watched last transaction outputs there would be no confusion but some do need to follow the order book as well so we are going to change this to display such orders how people expect them to be displayed.

So far the changes were purely technical solutions to how the protocol works. We had one hard fork, meaning that the new code rules were incompatible with the old one and we had a couple of soft forks where the rules merely got stricter and were backwards compatible. Making rules stricter is less controversial and easier to implement as out right changing some rules because then only a majority of miners need to agree to make that change in order to avoid a hard fork.
But with an out right change, what ever this is (whether a technical solution or a monetary change) peers who switch become their own network and we get a hard fork meaning the whole network splits into two copies as they exist in the moment of the split and then each go their separate ways. What would happen then we don't really know because so far this is just theory and hasn't happened yet.
The only hard fork so far happened way back in 2010 when a critical technical flaw was discovered. Likewise if we ever need to switch to a better encryption algorithm it would require a hard fork that would likely get full support.

What does this have to do with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-10-02 12:14:39
This is how this needs to work.
User registers with a Bitcoin address(or a public key) with a service. That service then needs to require a unique random message to be signed with the corresponding private key for each login attempt. The private key needs to be stored on a Trezor like hardware device. The site provides the message, the users signs it through a client by getting authorization via a hardware wallet device, and then sends the signed random message to the service in order to gain access. The service should then also provide the option to have each critical request be confirmed with the exact same procedure but with different public key to protect against session hijacking.
I'm convinced that however get's this working with gmail will be filthy rich.
p.s.: Using this procedure but with a Bitcoin wallet stored on your HDD is almost just as pointless as a password.

It's all bullshit exchanges rather do instead of testing in court whether or not the gang known as the government will interpret their laws to mean that running a Bitcoin exchange is the equivalent to whatever it is what they call money transmitting. Of course it's not equivalent. Bitcoins are not legally money, they are certainly not representations of dollars but their own currency so at most foreign exchange laws should apply as Bitcoin Foundation's response oh so beautifully explains here: 
But it's not just that exchanges don't want to have a criminal case against them and defend themselves, which would pretty much kill any exchange, it's that banks wont work with them unless they do this crap. So yeah, they're pretty much forced to self regulated.

How is corruption prevented where the majority of stolen money gets divvied up instead of spent on projects? ect ect

The paper is wrong.


This is wrong, answer is here:


Thus the attacker is not mining at full efficiency but at X efficiency just as he would if he did not keep his found block secret until it is actually constituting to the longest chain. 
I mean putting it plainly? If he finds a block before the network does he publishes it, if he does not he starts from scratch again, how is this different from what all miners already do anyway??

This is false.
What you need for a rule change is for every Bitcoin node(mining or not) to download a new version of the Bitcoin software. In effect, unless you follow Bitcoin rules, you can't say you are using Bitcoin. Changed rules would mean that you started to use something else other than Bitcoin because what Bitcoin is is a peer to peer network of people running the Bitcoin software. And as long as you have more than two nodes in such a peer to peer network, no matter what software similar to Bitcoin other people run, Bitcoin will be alive and well and follow the same rules.

Mining is how the Bitcoin payment system is able to function securely in a decentralized fashion, that's all it is. All the details are just the technical specifics of how that is achieved.
Basically when you mine you're doing two things, you're validating new transactions, meaning you check if they follow the Bitcoin rules (look those up), and as a reward you're also issuing new bitcoins, if you get lucky that is. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 12:19:36

Right, but how does that help you when if gold was valued only for those purpose it would lose around 90% of it's current "monetary" value?

How does that make you feel any better than if you lost near 100% of the value you exchanged for your bitcoins?

Debt is not money. But it is true that most of the debt today is so liquid that most people treat it as money even though it is still only debt.
An example is a demand deposit bank account. When what you own are IOUs for the most part (except for a small fraction) because the bank is most of the time able to repay the IOU through their reserves on demand most people treat their demand deposit balance as money. It's only when you read the fine print it becomes apparent how very wrong that is.

Unfortunately I do not posses the wisdom to predict how certain issues the market would solve that is why I said "the rest will sort itself".
Btw quick question, how are those bellowed regulations of yours working out today? Are people still willing to do shit that they think they should be able to do even though state regulations tell em not to?

Bitcoin is a piece of technology, it's computer code that allows you to do something useful. It's like email, no single entity owns it or controls it, it's just code that people agree to use.
And much like email allows you to send information to anyone anywhere for free and almost instantly so does Bitcoin allow you to send financial information in a similar manner.
The reason why this works is because certain mathematical laws are used in the design of this technology that make it possible to use it and not need to trust anyone else and still be virtually certain that the financial information you send or receive is not fraudulent or counterfeit.
And that's about it for starters.

Step 8: print the paper wallets
Step 9: power off your PC and printer, wait a few seconds before powering on again
Step 10: send bitcoins to your paper wallets
And viola, there's no chance any hacker could ever get to your bitcoins while you hold them.
Of course you need to be careful when spending them as well, but that's another story :)
p.s.: soon there will be hardware wallets available that have a high chance of making this whole issue moot
EDIT: please be aware that if it should happen that  gets corrupted before you saved it on your computer a hacker could very well get your coins but it's an open source project so it's fairly hard to pull off without everyone noticing and warning people. So be warned and be aware and remain ever vigilant with whom you give your trust to.

Why? Simple. Because compared to Amazon Coins, which is a contract between a corporation and a customer, bitcoins are simply points, monopoly money with no obligations from anyone to anyone for anything. Amazon will probably make a few promises around their gift cards tied to dollars and legally defined of some value, while with bitcoins there are no promises. It's just monopoly money (legally speaking of course) that some of us value.
So there's a huge legal difference.

No actually I wouldn't cause I don't care and it doesn't matter. Bitcoins are fungible. Period. A valid signature with the right private key confirmed by miners is all I care about.
@_date: 2013-01-04 10:58:59
Miners listen to all transactions, they each bundle up all the new not yet in the blockchain included transactions, and when they find a hash that is of the appropriate difficulty they add one more transaction into this bundle, this is the block reward which has no origin and is sent to their address, then they package all of this into a new block and send it into the network. If this block is following all the rules all the rest of the network adds it into their own copies of the blockchain. It's how two things can possibly work in Bitcoin in a decentralized way: the issuance of new bitcoins and from fraud protected transactions between users.

First of all a fiat currency simply means that something is a currency (typically) by a governments decree i.e. legal tender laws making something obligatory to be accepted as payment of debts and taxes.
Second of all what you are talking about is called fractional reserve banking and yes you are right, for example Bitcoin exchanges like mtgox could very well run a fractional reserve bank and right now all their customers have is their word that they aren't lending any of their deposits.

Call it what you want it doesn't change the fact that it's done without my explicit consent. And yes, even public law is coercion and therefor I don't care for it.
Btw if your public services are so desirable I have two questions for you:
1. Why do you have to force people to pay for them? No one forces me for example to pay my ISP.. or my dentist.
2. Why do you threaten and use violence against anyone who would want to compete with your public services or wanting to opt out of your public services ensuring you don't ever have any competition and you always keep a monopoly?
Open your eyes and wake up. If you want a free, peaceful and prosperous society, violence cannot be it's core foundation by definition. Stop supporting the public state and the public law and the public theft called taxes. Support private ownership and self determination, the rest will solve itself.

I disagree with that predicted causal relationship. I much more agree with the prediction that if possible on hobby level hardware, merchants, businesses and altruist users will run a full node, users like myself. At least there's a chance of this being true (I think a very likely chance). With unlimited block size there is no chance this happens, centralized Bitcoin is a certainty then.

The CEO believes his service should do the talking rather than his words which is why you rarely see him post on the forums or here unless of course a customer has an issue.
I used their exchange twice so far and because we're in the same country I got my deposit credited within 3 hours, the trading went beyond smooth and so did the withdrawal.

There are many that do however, professors in Universities, their students, professionals developing a product, military analysts, online banking developers, ect ect ect. Peer review does not mean review by all peers, it just means review by many relevant peers. You don't go to your auto mechanic for a second opinion when you have a health problem, you go to another doctor.
So you can drop your sophistry and spread your FUD someplace else. I wont buy it.

Strictly speaking it can't be anonymous, but it can be truly pseudonymous which is the next best thing if you're trying to hide what you do with your money. And yes.. with enough effort you can link someone to some transaction but so what? Because of how Bitcoin is designed you can most likely link a lot of other people to the same transaction, so what good does that do? 
It's virtually impossible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that someone "owns" a certain address and has carried out a certain transaction without having access to their computer and their wallet and their Bitcoin client history.
@_date: 2013-03-03 10:31:56
It's a really bad name - mining, it would be much more appropriately called auditing. Miners audit or validate that transactions follow the Bitcoin rules and a block is just the method by which the new validated transactions get added to the public ledger.

1. it's relatively secure but use two factor authentication and two factor encryption (go to account settings -&gt; security) to significantly lower the chances of someone getting into your wallet but also install  that can warn you if the operator should change the open source code for handling your wallet. This still doesn't make it as safe as a paper wallet but it's quite safe. Personally I keep only a small amount I can live with losing outside of my paper wallet.
2. they mean they make a secure copy of their wallet file, with blockchain.info you can do this by simply emailing yourself a backup
3. so far I haven't heard anything bad about seals but be aware, they may be no different than fulltilt and could end up ripping you off which has nothing to do with Bitcoin.

It's a bit dicey right now, I'm a huge Bitcoin supporter and I think it's going to go a lot bigger from here but I can't in good conscience tell you that there is no short term risk you might overpay.
In these kind of situations what investors like to do is something called cost averaging. It means you decide on a day in a month or a week when you are going to buy the bitcoins, how much you want to eventually end up with and over how long of a period do you want to average your purchases. Then you you simply on the day you decided buy a proportional fraction of the amount you want to end up with regardless of the price. This way sometimes you'll pay more, sometimes less but in the end it will average out to a decent price. That's the best advice I can give you. More info on cost averaging:

Bitcoin is a brand new technology that gives you the ability to:
- be in full control over your finances at all times
- define how public you want your ID information to be within a transaction
- protect yourself from anyone being able to freeze or seize your money
- receive money without having to pay any fees
- practically eliminate the risk of fraud via chargebacks
- preserve your purchasing power through ensured limitedness of bitcoins
- send any amount of wealth to anyone, anywhere, anytime without having to ask for anyone’s permission
Bitcoin is important because it represents:
- freedom
- honesty
- progress
- complete control over your finances
Basically there’s nothing on this planet that comes even close to it an if you care about any of this then you should definitely care about Bitcoin.

Nothing arrives.
Everything depends on the blockchain, the distributed public ledger. In that ledger you have a log of all transactions that ever happened, transactions between Bitcoin addresses. When someone sends you bitcoins what they do is they enter your Bitcoin address into their client, and using their private key corresponding to their Bitcoin address they "sign over" the bitcoins to you and this is what a transaction is - them "signing over" their bitcoins to your address. But this transaction has nothing to do with your client and your wallet, it goes into the public ledger - the blockchain - and is added into a block which then your client downloads and because your client sees that a transaction within this new block added coins to one of the addresses in your wallet file, it adds those bitcoins to your balance. And when you're sending those bitcoins to someone else, you have to use either the private key on your paper wallet or a private key in your digital wallet (which the client does automatically) to sign over your bitcoins to someone else's Bitcoin address. So basically wallet.dat is just a digital paper wallet storing your Bitcoin addresses and your private keys.

A limit was arbitrarily chosen for security reasons how much space can a block have, limited to 1Mb. The problem is this limit means that on average every 10min only so many transactions fit into a block which means Bitcoin can scale regarding transactions per second only up to a point. The reason this issue is charged is two fold:
1) changing this rule would require a so called hard fork, meaning Bitcoin users would pretty much all have to switch to a client incompatible with the previous versions and it's very hard to get the consensus to do it where you don't end up with half of users on the old version and half of users on the new versions causing all kinds of damage to the Bitcoin economy
2) lifting the block size limit may have negative repercussions down the road for the decentralization of the network hence why some, including me, object to it
@_date: 2013-02-13 18:08:43

In case you didn't know barter is taxable. That is if they find out you did any. So the same would hold true with purchases when paid with bitcoins.

Banks are useful because they offer a useful service of safeguarding your money and other stuff which provides convenience to you and there's nothing inherently wrong with them.
The problem is the current status quo monetary system which spawned this oppressive financial system that is robbing and enslaving everyone. With a honest monetary system, such Bitcoin is, we will not have this problem.
@_date: 2013-02-26 18:22:45
What did you think peer to peer and decentralized meant? Bitcoin never was anything else. It always was a bunch of nodes speaking a language following the same rules that which made Bitcoin the system. It's what hardcoded means. Hardcoded does not mean that it can't be changed, it's open source code, of course it can be changed. It always meant that you can't change it and speak to other nodes.
So really what you think of two different approaches is one and the same. There is no Bitcoin without it's original rules that all nodes part of it follow and there is no Bitcoin without all the nodes part of it that follow the original rules.

Possible.. sure! At least technically speaking. But in practice probably not. As you may have already learned Bitcoin transaction are irreversible, neteller/mastercard are not so you see it's a good way to get scammed so most people don't do it.

It's a new from-the-ground-up implementation (read newly programmed computer code) of the Bitcoin protocol. Currently all software is based on the original bitcoind implementation which was started by Satoshi and is now being developed by a bunch of volunteers and a paid programmer Gavin.
btcd is very important because it means we have another group of programmers with their own version of how they implemented the Bitcoin protocol providing us with options which may one day be very handy if bitcoind should experience any bugs or the devs start implementing shit the rest of us don't want.

Sorry to burst your bubble but government mafia wants it's fair share and will have it too. Already the same argument could be made for barter however if you check the tax law you'll find that even barter is taxed.
It is however far more difficult to prove and audit and in that sense such taxes would be way more voluntarily paid than they are now, if not entirely voluntarily. ;)

The storage space in a single block is currently arbitrarily limited and so there's a supply and demand market for it where the price is expressed in fees.
Currently the limit isn't being reached yet so fees are only there to prevent spam and ddos attacks. But once we start running out of that supply miners will begin to prioritize validating and including new transaction into new blocks depending on how high the attached fee is.
So to answer your question, fees go to miners i.e. those who validate transactions and keep the Bitcoin network secure and they are currently set at an arbitrary level for security purposes but in the future they will be free floating and follow the supply and demand for space in the blockchain.

Wrong. In order to trust SHA-256 you have to trust peer review.
SHA-256 is open source, anyone in the entire world can examine it, play with it, try to break it, try to find flaws and since this peer review hasn't found such a flaw and hasn't been able to break it you know you can trust it. The same goes for the entire Bitcoin code and why it doesn't matter who wrote it.

All addresses are already created, they are simply a X to a Y in an equation. All that happens is that when you generate a new address you pick a random Y and compute the X for that Y. This has nothing to do with the block chain. Your Y is then your private key and your X is then the public key or your Bitcoin address.
This works because computing the Y out of the X is extremely hard (read impossible). And all Bitcoin does when you send a transactions is check if X (the public address) meets certain standards.. You could just as well send to a X that no one has the Y for if it meets those standards. And you could just as well generate a X someone else already generated. But you are right and the chances are so slim it's next to impossible although it could happen (theoretically).

There's this marketplace with drugs behind Tor, where everyone is anonymous and they manage to keep fraud to a level that allows that market to function. A market that is online and no one knows anyone.
If that market solved the fraud issue to a manageable level, I don't know how a market where participants are all known couldn't. 
I'm hostile because I don't have a lot of patience with silly questions, especially not silly questions that the person asking them has already answered them.
It's a simple fact that Bitcoin turns things on it's head, where in traditional systems the payer was protected while now with Bitcoin the payee is. This doesn't mean that all of sudden nothing can be done against fraud, it just means everyone will have to adjust and start using different tools. Something that is quite common sense and should be obvious to just about anyone.

blockchain.info uses an inbrowser client that is downloaded from their server every time you visit their site. By installing a plugin you ensure that the code of that client is the same as it was when you installed it and hence if a hacker hacks blockchain and changes the client to something malicious you wont be affected because you already downloaded it.
So no, it's not the same as HTTPS, not in the least, and you should definitely make room for it.

Yes and no. Yes it does if you'd have to have all transactions on chain, no because you don't have to. As an example Coinbase's primary goal is to be a paypal for Bitcoin meaning to facilitate off chain transfers between their users. You can send mtgox codes or bitstamp codes between other users of those exchanges, there are other solutions being worked on to make off chain transactions a real viable solution and hence that 7tps can turn into effective 10000 easily while still keeping the blockchain size reasonable for hobbyist full nodes and less efficient miners and hence decentralized.
