Yes, but can I use the same wallet for both? Wouldn't it be better to have separate wallets?
Also, what about the transaction? Is there anything that I can do to ensure my transaction goes smoothly?

Hey guys.
I currently have my coins in a wallet on a mobile app. It's most likely not a actual wallet since the address always changes, it's probably a service and my coins actually belong to the company behind the app.
Anyways, I plan on buying a Trezor cold storage wallet.
Are there any step by step guides how to use it and make the transfer?
I am worried because I will be transferring 1 bitcoin. It may not seem like much for some of you guys, but given the current price, it seems like a fortune to me.
Some of the things i am most worried about are:
1. The transfer it's self going smooth. I hear that transactions are very slow now and some people are saying their bitcoins get stuck in limbo for days on end ( or even lost, is that possible? ) due to insufficient transaction fees. The app doesn't seem to have a way to increase the transaction fee so I'm worried on ending up in that sort of situation. Any tips on preventing that?
2. Am I understanding correctly cold storage as a permanent address? I've read a few articles about the idea but other then being slightly safer then keeping bitcoin on a app / exchange, I'm still not entirely sure how it works. Assuming I send my bitcoin there, what happens then? How do I use them after?
3. I know bitcoin cash is hated here, hope this question doesn't annoy you. But I have bitcoin cash because I had bitcoin since before the split. I want to buy a cheap and simple cold storage wallet for bitcoin cash as well, but I don't want to spend 100$ like trezor. What cold storage would you suggest for under 25$?
