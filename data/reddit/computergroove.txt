Am I reading this wrong? Wasn't there a huge spike at the end of 2017?

Pretty sure OP is suggesting that bitcoin is worth a lot in the very near future.

Little steep dont you think? Instead of 90 degrees up maybe try 10 degrees and put your hands down.

Also not taking into account the fact that wages go up too.

Id pay if you can provide this service.

If I was a betting man I would suggest massive cheap labor creating / perpetuating online scams trading bitcoin data for your locked data through viruses etc.

Just say you did.

Somebody on the internet said it so it must be true.

Because he's hacking the confidence in the market.

What has this administration said that it hasnt acted on?
@_date: 2018-07-12 15:48:57

Im curious about where everyone is getting the idea that the crusades was unprovoked lately. Steven crowser did a great piece on the crusades if the cucks at youtube havent removed it yet.

Well if you read the Quran and do a simple subtraction problem ~ quaran written in 609 ad and the discovery of the americas in 1492 you'll get an 883 year difference before the west was even a thing and the quaran talks about world conquest through all kinds of deception and violence. Im sure i wont change your mind though. Propoganda is too dificult to battle with logic.
