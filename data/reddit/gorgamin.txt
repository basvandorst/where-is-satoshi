Finance does need solving worldwide. Do you know that you can't get a Swift code if you're not on a US foreign policy certified list? More than half of the world cannot trade with any of us in the West as their banks have no way of interfacing with the rest of the world. Bitcoin changes that.
I hope you realise that the money you have in the bank is just an entry in a database. There is NOTHING backing it. You already need a username and password and 2FA to access you bank account, so it isn't a big deal.
"their shits been stolen anyway" If you give out your internet banking details to thieves of throw away a banknote instead of keeping it safe, you lose it too. Personal responsibility. My grandparents can keep their private keys safe, why can't you? Buy a Trezor.
Steam dropped Bitcoin as a result of high fees and their lack of knowledge on how to refund purchases when the price goes up. You can still buy Steam games with Bitcoin on G2A.
Criticism is fine, but you need to have a realistic point of view and the truth of the situation to be consistent with a perspective of something.

You might think that mining is trivial, but think about the total power cost of all the hundreds of thousands of Visa and Mastercard payment terminals worldwide and their supporting servers and infrastructure. I would bet that their power usage exceeds all miners combined. And what do they all do? Nothing. Those silly plastic card with no security are incredibly inefficient. All those till slips of paper wasted and for no reason, when a simple wallet with a QR code can replace all of it. 
Besides, mining efficiency is kept in check by a rising difficulty rate, so older rigs quickly become pointless to keep on. 
Proof of Work Mining is necessary as with Proof of Stake you lose decentralization as there is no incentive point to run a node, meaning that the network will be mostly centralized.
Decentralization is the real reason why we are all here, it is the principle you should never undermine or sacrifice. If we lose decentralization, we might as well go back to banks.

Don't be so doom and gloom. Ripple isn't decentralized, has no nodes and it costs 20 Ripple to open a wallet. Which is about $50 or more now? The price might go up, but it isn't actually a cryptocurrency. Its just a token. Banks may love it, but even if its market cap exceeds Bitcoin it just means means a centralised network is larger. Visa and Mastercard are larger for now. If it makes the horrible Swift bank situation a little better, more power to it.
The whole reason we are a part of Bitcoin is for the decentralization and immutability of transactions.
Ripple as a centralized coin can be edited to change values, or to increase the total amount in circulation, which is exactly the same as the USD and all other FIAT.
 If the banks beat us with a decentralized coin, then I'd worry, but they won't as it would dismantle their entire hierarchy.
So am I worried that a centralised token or a digital version of the USD  (which has $1.5 Trillion) might have a larger market cap? No I'm not at all.

It's still well on its way to lambo and actually a steady climb if you cut off all the highs and lows. I prefer real volatility. They already figured out a way to make something appear stable when it isn't, its called FIAT and they do it with inflation of the money supply. 
The price is the least interesting part about it though. It will bring financial services to more than half of the worlds population who don't have a bank account. 
Sure the transaction speed and costs are still a work in progress, but when it is figured out, and they will, it will solve finance globally.

Miners can choose which transaction fees to mine. If you mine to a pool, they choose higher fee transactions for the obvious reason of higher reward. If you can gather enough support in a pool to mine low fee transactions, and you can find he cryptographic hash fast enough to solve the block, lower fee transactions will go through faster.
You're confusing block reward with transaction fee processing.

Lol. You should read up on how Lightning Network works:
Scaling off-chain does exactly the opposite of what you're suggesting. After transacting through a LN channel, the coins can become on-chain again at any time. Less transactions = less miner centralization &amp; control.

You should anyway not buy on any exchange. If you don't own your Private Keys, you own nothing. Support Localbitcoins, they have Segwit wallets. Then move your coins to a Segwit seed generated Wallet. I recommend Green Address or get a Trezor. 
And lastly, demand to be paid your salary/wages in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:55:37
So no one has to pay for it right? The merchant just absorbes the fee and it isn't carried to the product price? 
Have you ever run a business? Operating costs are integrated into products in ANY business. Sure they're not allowed to charge less on cash purchases, or itemize the card merchant fee but it is still absorbed into the product price. 
And yes, VISA does charge the consumer transaction fees too. You might not notice it as you are billed montly for the bank account maintenance fee, but it is still there.
You're a little naive you know.

My question is: Where did that $300B go? Back to FIAT? I highly doubt it as taxes start showing up when you cash out back to savings. It was withdrawn to be spent. Everything is random psychological buying cycles. Swarm behaviour.
Things that back up my argument:
1. Number of vehicles (supercars, luxury cars, bikes, boats, yachts, jetskis) bought from Crypto profits
2. Number of real estate bought from Crypto profits. 
3. Number of electronics bought as a result of Crypto profits.

This is exactly what people should understand. If they can do a better job, please contribute to the github, or sit down. And no blocksize updates are not the way.

@_date: 2017-12-31 11:05:17
If you think other Cryptocurrencies can outperform Bitcoin with their own scaling solutions, go ahead and believe that, and we'll see in a few years when they face the same challenges, but if you think that their code is independent and not downstream from Bitcoin Core and their github, you have not compared many source codes.
The Bitcoin github has the most consistent commits and number of commits, they are unmatched by anyone else. This is not something you can dispute, it is a fact, the figures speak for themselves. 
It is easy to copy code and not credit the original author, but they know they didn't write it nor do they understand how to implement it effectively. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:01:48
I know this. But if you look at the centralization of nodes on coins that have larger 8MB blocks you will see the issue. The Segwit 0.16 update will increase the size to 4MB which is a much more realistic size to have.

I'm still amazed at the fact that they cannot see this. We've had decades of testing in the torrent community to find out that larger than 2mb blocks don't pan out well. I think that internet infrastructure and specifically network latency is holding Bitcoin back, so we'll need to work out a solution that allows for high latency networks. At the moment it takes 150ms+ to send a packet from NY to Tokyo regardless of internet speed. We need to find a way around that while staying decentralized.

Bigger blocks are not the solution. Abandoning decentralization as a principle is not a solution. This is like saying that running a central server will be far faster so we should just all do it, but at the cost of losing decentralization. Sure, centralized servers will always be more efficient, but what we are trying to do here is build a decentralized network that can scale at better efficiency than centralized servers. And we will succeed. 
Bigger blocks are not worth the sacrifice of decentralization. You too will learn this lesson when BCH tries to scale one day, young padawan. From what I see it is very difficult to run a BCH full node on a bad internet connection. This should REALLY worry you far more than the temporary low cost and faster transaction times you seem to think are worth the sacrifice.

The reason is that you lose decentralization, as it will basically timeout any node that does not verify within the blocktime window, meaning centralization will occur. Increasing the blocksize is a lazy fix. This isn't the answer. Bitcoin Core 0.16 will support full Segwit transactions and wallets. Rather push your favourite exchange to support Segwit fully. It is fast and cheap.
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:25:20
Just like BCH nodes aye? ;) Seem like they keep timing out if you're not in a datacentre. 
Should keep an eye on that in the future, it's s going to come back and bite you in the ass when you sacrifice principles for lazy 8MB blocksize fixes.
When you invariably realise you need to reduce the blocksize, call me so I can have a fresh warm bucket of popcorn ready for the fiasco that awaits when you realise that once you increase the blocksize you can never reduce it.

You can't fake good code. The Bcash devs are unrealistic to think they can match the Bitcoin team in commit consistency or number of commits. The fact that they have the arrogance to suggest they are better, or that they are the "real" Bitcoin is hilarious, and yet their codebase is a bunch of tumbleweeds in comparison. It is pure hubris. 
Please note that the Bitcoin Core devs have never said they are better. They just keep working onwards.
Have a look and compare these two:
**BCH "devs"**
Compared to 
**Bitcoin Core**
The further fact that the BCH "devs" don't have the integrity to fork from the Bitcoin github projects and credit Bitcoin Core, just goes to show their lack of principles. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:21:14
The world is going to change very quickly and very soon. Those degrees are bad investments as you still haven't learnt the lesson of not depending on an authority. Knowledge needs no authority to verify your ability. Decentralization is not about getting rich fast. It's about rethinking the entire organizational system we use as a species. This is only the beginning. You don't see what is coming at all.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:24:13
Because Bitcoin Cash claims to be Bitcoin when all it is, is a fork. I've made a number of forks too, but they don't bring anything new to the table. The outrageous claims from fireworks salesmen are too good to pass up a joke on. 
BCash would have so much more credibility is it chose another name. For instance if it was called Bitmain Cash it would demonstrate its true purpose far better.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:41:41
I wonder if they think that their FUD will somehow magically convince us against our better judgement. If anything it just forces people to become more knowledgeable and to figure out that what they are saying is completely misguided. 
Any person who is pro BCH at this point is entirely untrustworthy in my opinion. So keep on FUDding guys. You just make yourselves look even worse. You will never be Bitcoin, no matter what you do. You're a fork of a dead chain, which we discarded.

This is a subreddit about Bitcoin. I don't really care for the medical field. In fact I believe AI will replace most of it. Maintaining an organic machine can be automated. IBM has already shown that AI can diagnose most problems more accurately than a doctor, with far less bias, though specialists will probably still be required. Robotics will solve the rest of the problems.
You forget that universities as we know it have no place in the future, where information will be instantly available. Why place trust in a centralized organization that is only interested in financial gain if we could have an education platform that can verify credentials in a decentralized manner with all information instantly available, with no restrictions on when or where you can prove your knowledge or practical ability. It is not a matter of if but when they will be replaced.
Placing trust in an authority will ALWAYS be the wrong direction for mankind. Universities are the wrong direction. Decentralize everything.

A quick look at the mempool stats show you're incorrect. The larger blocks have nothing to do with it, it is a lack of volume. 
Because Ethereum Classic isn't stuck on hilarious debates on blocksize. They rely on actions rather than marketing to gather their support. There is also the fact that they're not afraid to keep their code on github. Which is something that really irks bcash users when you ask them why they don't show that their entire branch is downstream from Bitcoin Core. 
Larger blocks are a lazy fix to the real issue.

I own both BTC and ETH. In fact I actually mine ETH professionally. I want both of them to succeed. Scaling issues will still be there if we don't implement Lightning Network or another solution. Saying that any one current coin is superior is shortsighted as they all HAVE to deal with the scaling problem. ETH does not have 1million TXs per day. Those are Token coins riding on the network and cryptokitties and other DAPPS. I'd say true ETH to ETH TXs are relative to the market cap size.

@_date: 2017-12-31 11:15:25
Unlike BCH (who has no developers, only downstream compilers), some developers have the integrity to perfect solething before they implement risky and lazy solutions like 8MB blocks. LN will be done when it is done. Test networks have shown positive results so far. 
Strange that most BCH nodes are hosted in datacentres, and a small percentage is actually hosted by the community ;) You should try run a BCH node in a country with slow internet access and when you can't you can think of the decentralization you sacrificed for 8MB blocks. Sacrificing principles for a lazy fix will never yield anything positive.

I prefer actual dev innovation above underhanded tactics. Those who only grab the low hanging fruit usually don't stay around for long. Admit that 8MB blocks did close to nothing, and that there are real scaling issues to solve, then we might take Bcash seriously. The way in which the Bcash community goes about trying to gather support isn't fooling anyone with a technical understanding of the situation. You don't cultivate trust by tricking people into using your coin.

@_date: 2017-12-27 17:55:27
Actually, BitTorrent uses both TCP and UDP. 
This data is not irrelevant. BitTorrent is the best real world test example for a distributed network with hash functionality, that demonstrates that large piece sizes lead to redownloads and timeouts and actually congest the network. 
This is even more relevant with a distributed ledger where you're constantly comparing blocks. To find a single transaction you have to sift through an entire 8MB block instead of a smaller 1MB to find one entry and then discard the rest of the data after the comparison. Now tell me this. Is it better the discard most of 1MB of data, or most of 8MB of data when traversing across a P2P network? How much of the data transferred in a comparison is done for no reason?
I'll admit that transactions on non-Segwit wallets are more expensive and take longer when the mempool is full, but increasing the blocksize is a shortcut fix akin to sweeping an issue under a rug. The underlying scaling issue is still there. And next time it emerges it will be a dragon.
Now let's get to the part of why this hasn't been addressed yet: If you look at the developer priorities of the Bitcoin github, you will see that reducing transaction fees and the amount of unconfirmed transactions have been put on the backburner in exchange for more pressing issues for example fixing the scaling issue, but for real, and not with a lazy 8MB blocksize upgrade. Bitcoin Core client 0.16 is almost here which will support full Segwit wallets.
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:12:54

Lol have you ever run a full node? Or seeded a torrent for that matter? Smaller blocks will always be more efficient in a decentralized database. It's the reason why we don't use large flatfiles. It also allows you to be efficient when specifically comparing certain parts of data against other nodes. It is far quicker to pull a small block and compare it, that to compare a large blocks and move all the excess data for no reason. Larger blocks is a temporary lazy shortcut that won't fix the true issues. 
The real reason why Bitcoin transactions have become more expensive and slower is a result of 1. Too many tokens riding on top of the network, 2. Internet latency. 3. Lack of Segwit adoption on exchanges.

We could increase it to 128MB right now, and within a decade we'd have to increase again to 1024MB if Bitcoin continues to grow and scale like it is. That's a given. The limit has to be adjusted.
But the network is far more important. The latency between nodes on the intercontinental backbones is the real issue here. If there was less latency, we wouldn't even have an issue with block size.

I've rolled out more than 30x 100Gbe switch gear in the last while. 
But I believe the real answer doesn't lie with Copper or Fibre as media, but in low to medium-orbit Ka-band satellites. A constellation of them in fact. It has the widest reach and lowest implementation cost. It is by far the best way to reach sub 50ms Worldwide latency.
o3b is doing this right now. 
They have a constellation of 12 satellites in orbit already, with plans to roll out many more. All you need to access is just the equipment and a subscription. Its already available in a vast number of countries. 
SpaceX (Elon Musk) also has a project they're rolling out from 2020 onwards, with a constellation of over 4400 satellites.
If we can bring down the cost of latency through economies of scale, this will connect the world. 
It will make the Bitcoin network super fast.
What we can do personally is tell people about Gigabit, low-latency satellite constellation networks. Demand connectivity from your ISP. The signals are already TXing and RXing.

G. Andrew Stone &amp; Andrew Clifford: Bitcoin Unlimited (Episode 166)
What did they do before Bitcoin Unlimited? Just woke up one day and decided they want to fork the bitcoin git?
Look at this commit history:
I wouldn't hire these devs for my own company with a resume or online presence like that. Let alone the biggest supercomputer on Earth, or the biggest cryptocurrency.
I want to see extensive git contributions, an all-star stackoverflow profile, a Linked-in page with vast experience. They should be devs every company would love to hire.
Once again, nothing against their plan. Its their inexperience that troubles me. Their past projects and resume is not even a 10th of the devs of any of the Top 5 cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, DASH, Monero or Ripple. Why are pools trusting them, when they know nothing about them?
Make an informed decision.

Spammed for the third time now. This was the message:
I doubt Ethereum endorses this at all. 
from bilqisaefentid sent 10 minutes ago
I am sending you this message because the crypto community is too heavily censored, please read carefully.
The original of idea bitcoin is to create a decentralized money system that prevents censorship and being shutdown. Proof of work seemed like a good way to achieve that. The real power in the bitcoin world is helt by the miners, as long as the mining process is properly decentralized bitcoin will be decentralized. But real world competition caused many cracks to appear in this model, the first flaws that appeared were pooled mining (centralizing power with mining operators), then came ASICs (Centralizing power with mining operators with good industry connections), then came cheap electricity + latency issues (Centralizing power with mining pools with access to cheap electicity and low latency to others big mining pools). These pressures has essentially caused mining to be centalized mainly in China because there they have cheap electricity, good industry for creating ASICs and low latency to other chinese mining pools (and high latency to the rest of the world).
One important thing to keep in mind is that bitcoin itself can evade capital controls and move seamlessly accross borders. But mining equipment cannot. It would be easy to confiscate all mining equipment in the country and use it to destroy bitcoin.
So what is the solution to this problem? Proof of stake is the solution because it removed the physical element and allows network voting power to move seamlessly accross borders too. Traditional Proof of Stake contains some flaws like the Nothing at Stake problem. But the new algorithm designed for proof of stake in Ethereum solved all these issues.
The bitcoin developer community has proven that it is unable to make even small changed to the consesus algorithm. So completely switching to a different model is never going to happen.
If you are willing to open your mind and learn about how Ethereum will beat bitcoin by being far superior to bitcoin watch the videos of Devcon1
Bitcoin is doomed and Ethereum will replace it.
Obviously most people involved in Ethereum are aware of this. But for most other people it is not so obvious. But it is hard to convince the masses because they are not reading enough information about Ethereum, either because of censorship in subs or because of denial.
Therefore I think it is the mission of each of us to get the word out. Only by saying it often and giving clear examples we can teach the masses what we already know. Try to reach at least on uninformed person every day. (If you lack ideas, just post the link to this post in different reddit subs with target audience).
First of all it is important to remind people that Bitcoin was also once small, and that people also did not believe in Bitcoin because they couldn't imagine what benefit it would give over conventional payment systems. That perception changed dramatically for bitcoin and the same will happen to Ethereum. It is important to emphasise this because people often use the psychological principle of Social Proof to make decisions in unknown situations, this is currently working against Ethereum, the underlying reasoning is, "If Ethereum is so great why is it so cheap?", "If Ethereum is so great why is everyone talking about Bitcoin?", "If Ethereum is so great, why are the smart people X, Y and Z not invested in it?".
Second of all it is important to emphasise that not only is Ethereum a crypto that offers a whole new concept of the decentralized web, it is also better than Bitcoin at being a currency for payments. This is easy to show by explaining a real world scenario. Imagine the perfect crypto currency, obviously it should be possible to re-implement the most convenient payment systems used today using that crypto currency, and doing so in a decentralized way, with no added fees or middle man. It should be able to behave very much like cash in being able to spend it quick and easy. The most similar electronic product that offers this is the anonymous tap to pay, prepaid payment card. It is easy, it is anonymous, it wont be hacked like phones, it has the ability to limit exposure to compromise by having limited balance that automatically recharged and the end of the day. Implementing this in Bitcoin would not be possible because the small chip in the card is not connected to the internet, and sharing your private key is a security hazard. But what if your wallet/contract could use asymmetric encryption to accept a different secret payment key on every payment. This way it is possible to implement the payment with a touch to pay card in a secure way. In Ethereum it is also possible to program a contract to recharge a wallet at the end of every day for added security, It is also possible to automatically exchange Ethereum for a token that is backed by a stable currency for those merchants that are worried about exchange fluctuations.
Third of all it is important to note that Bitcoin is never going to be implementing these changes. Look how hard it is for them to implement a blocksize increase. Changing the scripting language to Turing complete would be a far more controversial change. One that the miners will probably never agree to this. And also keep in mind that quick payments need either zero-confirmation transactions or fast blocktime.
So if Ethereum has the potential to implement the most convenient payment system imaginable but Bitcoin cannot then one can only conclude that Ethereum will win in the long run. Bitcoin will die like Myspace, and Ethereum will become the golden standard.
EXhale, TL;DR.

The current blocksize is an inherent security feature. That together with the difficulty rate and block reward, are crucial elements to keep Bitcoin a limited supply currency. ASIC development will just have to keep pushing for 14nm FinFet efficiency to try prove Moore's law right once again. Changing anything with how bitcoin works would undermine its ability to push for faster hardware, keeping the supply and price in check with the difficulty rate and blockreward halving.

Many of us have some reading to do, especially regarding double spend, Replace by Fee and 0-conf, as most of us, myself included up to now, don't understand how it works, and we're blowing everything out of proportion with our misconceived understanding and halting much needed progress as a result. 
These are good things, as no one accepts 0-conf transaction, most wallets and payment processors only start accepting on the 3rd confirmation, and state the amount of confirmations as well. We have some reading to do.  
These comments from Peter Todd should convince you:
+                    // Use Full-RBF rules for extremely high fee replacements.
+                    //
+                    // A high-fee replacement most likely means one of two
+                    // things:
+                    //
+                    // 1) Someone is trying to reverse a mistaken high-value
+                    //    transaction, e.g. due to a theft-in-progress or
+                    //    because they accidentally sent the money to the wrong
+                    //    person.
+                    //
+                    // 2) Someone sent a large amount of money to an
+                    //    anyone-can-spend address. (e.g. a sacrifice to fees
+                    //    tx)
+                    //
+                    // What it's not likely is that the recipient is accepting
+                    // the transation without a confirm - that'd be crazy given
+                    // the notoriously poor security of zeroconf.
I think the consensus is core is too careful, classic wants a 2mb block size increase, xt want an even bigger increase.
We need faster confirmations, smaller fees and more transactions per second. Also, if you have harddrive space and a fast connection, please run a full node!

No conspiracies. Only an irresponsible reaction that's unprofessional coming from someone who is directly associated with Bitcoin. Just because you're volunteering your contribution doesn't give you the right to announce failure on the rest of the community. Call conspiracy all you want. Those that matter agree it was rash.

For security it should stay exactly as is. If people don't like it, move to another coin. There are a few SHA256 alternatives with exactly the features that are being argued for.

Doesn't make it any less true. Not a single Proof of Stake currency has shown it can handle the scale of Bitcoin, or even its closest five competing currencies. At this scale you need to provide a decentralized incentive for processing the transactions. Bitcoin is no doubt revolutionary, but no one said it is free. Free POS coins will fail when they try to scale. Even Ethereum has backed off their POS plans until they figure out how. Even running a 100GB+ (Bitcoin Blockchain size) 
node costs money and bandwidth.

Do you have any proof of this or should we trust your anecdotal evidence?
"funneling it into the pockets of whales"
There is no evidence of this either. The very concept of a "whale" is a conspiracy at best. I'd rather place market cycles as a random psychological buying pattern.
"a method for the wealthy to inflate their wealth" So you'd want a currency that only caters to the poor? Why?
It seems to me you're more upset you didn't get in when the price was low. There's one crucial point you're missing. Bitcoin is far more than your personal investment vehicle. It's a currency. Whether you made a profit is irrelevant to the real goals of the currency. The IMF predicts Bitcoin will be mainstream by 2025. The CEO of Xapo has predicted 1BTC=$1 Million price within 5-10 years. What this actually is, is how a currency would react if there was no inflation. 
The best part is I don't even have to convince you. The majority of the world will use it within a decade whether you like it or not.

Rules of engagement:
Never use your real name online. 
Segment accounts under different addresses.
Enable 2FA on everything. Don't use a known cell number, or a cell number at all. 
Browse the internet within a VM that is VPNd, so you're protected by a sandbox.

Its calculated on most efficient hardware cost (which is the Bitmain Antminer S9), measured against total Bitcoin hashrate, and how much it would cost to purchase 51% of the hashrate. 
The Antminer S9 is currently the most efficient SHA256 ASIC manufactured at 16nm process. I doubt anything better is available. But lets say they've somehow managed to get 11nm or 7nm SHA256 ASICs to work with the aid of Intel, IBM or AMD, and taking into consideration economies of scale, the cost to make such hardware work, would offset just buying already available 16nm ASICS.
So at this moment, I'd say the 51% attack cost estimate is pretty close.

True enough. Even further. SHA encryption was invented by the NSA. I've no doubt they've got SHA rainbow tables, though it won't be possible to break SHA256, as blockchain tech is specifically engineered to allow bruteforcing (essentially what you're doing by mining). In context, the more money you throw at a problem, the easier it becomes to solve. 
That said, Bitcoin could adapt to prevent such attacks, an update could instantly with consensus make it impossible to do a 51% attack. 
That said, bitcoin still holds value. Abandoning cryptocurrency as the NSA could potentially be able to control it, does not mean that they will. 
Its like saying there's no point to have a safe as thieves will break in any way. Keeping your value in gold can be stolen too. Nothing is 100% safe.

My point is that any mobile device is the weakest link as its the easiest to exploit. Its naive to say its secure. You just need a USB cable to plug in that phone somewhere (for eg charging) to run an exploit, or even just wifi to perform a mitm attack. Any device with a battery is a risk. Its how networks are compromised the most. Mobile and wifi in any production environment should be a separate network with severe firewalling and intense vpn security.

Actually a 51% attack would cost ~$1,942,718,784.57
An F-35 is about ~$130 million
That's about 15x F-35s ( I personally think the plane is a sitting duck against an experienced F-16/MiG/Sukhoi pilot

But then again, if such an attack was to occur, the network would adapt.
Pools would fragment themselves automatically. Or the bitcoin core team or another team could simply exclude the US government pool in a fork. Perhaps they already control a pool.

Agreed. They're high maintenance toys that need at least 30% of the initial sticker price in maintenance over its lifetime. 
Interesting stat, average American spends $800 a year on vehicle maintenance. And considering the average American drives a $25000 car. This equates to 4% of the sticker price per year, in other words if we guesstimate that a car is driven on average for 10 years, that is $8000 after 10 years spent on maintenance or 32% of the sticker price spent keeping it running before it is crushed.

Didn't try to weasel their way into relevance.

Every ATM needs an internet connection to work. If the net is down, you're not getting any of your savings. At least with bitcoin your money is accessible worldwide. Low earth orbit Ku-band satellite constellations will soon mean internet access will be available anywhere.

This isn't true. Companies reverse engineer everything even if there are patents. Look at China. They don't give a crap about your 5 Billion patents, they'll reverse engineer it anyway and make you look like a fool. You still need the capital to defend it, which makes the entire point of patents pointless. Ideas are worth nothing, it's the implementation that holds value. R&amp;D will never be spent on ideas that aren't implementable anyway, so the idea that a piece of paper will protect your idea is very naive. It's simply not how the world works.

There are compromises to each. 
1. Offline wallets might give you your private keys, and seem secure, but if you're not technically minded and open random email attachments and use untrusted flash drives you don't know often, there is malware that specifically scans for wallet files now. Keep the wallet files on a secure computer or phone that you don't carry with you or keep online constantly. The more coins you have the more important this becomes. 
2. Online wallets you don't have control of the private keys, but you're protected from malware.
From what I can see so far, Trezor is the best.

Lol Visa charges you for that insurance. FIAT does not inherently have insurance on transactions. If you lose a $100 bill it is gone. Same with an electronic transfer. No one is going to help you. 
A payment processor can do exactly the same thing VISA does with Bitcoin. Charge you a fee and then that transaction is insured. There's a free business idea if you want one. You could provide a lot of value if you insured Bitcoin transactions for a fee.

If Nvidia discovered a potential market, they'd increase production and provide value.

Why don't we crowdfund a space program? We can do this with the internet and cryptocurrency. We'd create a far more efficient space program where politics would not be able to affect it as much.
A decentralized society doesn't need to recognize the government. Sure pay your minimum necessary taxes and stay out of jail, but after that, the government should be treated like a mafia. Just stay out of their way. We don't need to recognize their borders either.
If we instead create a smart contract where say SpaceX can be funded if they tick all the boxes, it would be far more responsible and efficient. In my opinion, all taxes should be smart contracts, where if projects fail, the government has no choice but to pay us back.
It is time that we stop recognizing the authority of governments, and move towards trustless taxing. With the Internet and cryptocurrency we can hold governments accountable.

Not a big fan of crypto ICOs. All of them start high at launch, then tank, and slowly build up again. Had too many lessons on this. Way better to support it after the launch tank, for eg. look at the launch graph for ZCASH.

It would actually be better for all of us if the Chinese military did stop all Chinese mining. Remember the reason why China is ahead on mining is a result of Western miners not stepping up to lead the mining race. With all our technology, power should actually be cheaper in the West. Why don't we have the most advanced and energy efficient ASICs? The West has "allowed" China to win this. **Removing the difficulty by moving away from PoW will allow Bitcoin to be compromised as it is far easier to create a majority consensus of nodes than it is to do with miners.**

"A currency is stable". My sweet summer child. Do you know that the stability you seek is inflation robbing you of your purchasing power? The whole point of Bitcoin is to reflect the actual value which is: Market Cap / Available Supply = Price. 
Bitcoin will always go up in value as more people become involved, whereas the USD will always go down in value. 
Establishing how much 0.000232 BTC is, isn't nearly as difficult as you think. You've just got to use it more. I'm now proficient at determining price without converting back to USD. You should try do that too. It is anyway a terrible idea to compare Bitcoin to an inflationary currency.

I'd argue that with the amount of malware that exists today and scans your computer for wallet keys, you're actually worse off if you're the average user. If you don't have them on an offline linux rig that isn't used for anything else, with regular backups and redundancy on those backups, or at least on a Hardware wallet, but one that is on-chain, you're not that better off. And you have the increased risk of having to physically secure your coins now.

100%. The altcoin shilling is intense. The only reason why these people are so interested in bitcoin is to push their favourite shitcoin which is apparently invulnerable to the scaling issues Bitcoin is facing, namely internet latency. When they reach the same size one day, they'll have to face the exact same issues. Even Segwit won't fix the fact that Johannesburg to New York has an inescapable 200ms latency.
