I'm aware of bitcointip, but I have no Bitcoin at the moment.  I decided to wait at the sideline for a better entry, and I think I'll get that in a week or two.

If I could tip the OP, I would.  My background:  I have a CS background.
I believe the idea behind Bitcoin is solid, this isn't an idea that someone's pulled out of their ass.  I agree with the OP, the problem isn't Bitcoin, the problem is the reliance on these unstable exchanges.  I personally think this was supposed to be a small/moderate correction, and given how the exchanges have handled this, it's turned into an panic sell off, due to the loss of confidence in the exchanges.
Bitcoin will take off, only if the larger institutional investors feel safe enough to put money in Bitcoin.  They need an exchange that can handle spikes in volume, with little lag, not exchanges that stick them with 1+ hour lag, and go off patting themselves on the back.
I'm waiting for the price to come down a bit more, then I plan to buy in.  Eventually the exchanges are going to get their shit together, or a good replacement will come up.  Once this happens, I think we'll see Bitcoin come up in value again.  I'd expect a good buy point will come up in a week or two.  Have to keep waiting and watching.
TL:DR:  Bitcoin has a solid foundation, all this is just "OMG, the exchanges suck!"

The bitcoin can be sent very quickly.  But, the transaction will be considered to be "unconfirmed" until confirmed.  
A miner has to include your transaction in a block, and mine the block to confirm the transaction.  The bitcoin protocol is designed to ensure that the bitcoin network mines a new block every 10 minutes.  So if the transaction fee is high enough, the transaction should take no more than 10 minutes on average to be confirmed.
However, if you don't include a transaction fee, or if the transaction fee is not large enough, it can take a very long time to confirm the transaction.  Some merchants require a certain number of confirmations before they will accept that you've paid up.  That can take some time, depending on the transaction fee.
transaction fees are added by the sender of bitcoin, and can be used as a way to tell the bitcoin network the priority of the transaction.  A large transaction fee will result in your transaction being confirmed much faster.
Here's a good 101 website on bitcoin: [bitcoin.org's getting started](
TL;DR: Seconds to transfer, can take longer depending on transaction fees.

[bitcoin charts](
If you look at the recent charts, you'll see that the price has been approaching resistance at the $100/BTC level.  The price challenged the $100/BTC resistance on the 15th, before dropping to a low starting late on the 15th, and through the 16th.  Since, we've seen strong resistance at $100/BTC, although the ranges are tightening up.  I think BTC is still looking for a bottom, possibly close to one now.  The last bubble took several months of slow declines to fully unwind though.

UltraSparc's answer is better than mine.  Simply put, the wall exists, because there are no buyers willing to pay that price.
And, as already mentioned, that can easily change as buyers get tired of trying to push orders through at a lower price, and decide they have to settle for the higher prices.
Edit: Added extra detail.
