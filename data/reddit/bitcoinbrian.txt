Use a password manager and use a good passphrase to secure it. There is no way that a single person could remember all of the passwords to the sites and services that the average person uses these days. And that's why they end up making compromises, like repeating passwords or easier to remember passwords.

Unless it's the old "pause withdrawals while we hope enough deposits come in to cover short-term future withdrawals because we lost a fuck ton of coins routine" that people sometimes try. The last grasp at a recovery before confidence in the system is shattered and a panic starts that sees people trying to withdrawal that would otherwise be holding crippling the ponzi scheme and forcing an admission of what actually happened. 
Hope it's not that. I hate that.

I thought Authy had some sort of encrypted cloud backup so you can transfer to a new phone? 
"For your convenience Authy can store an encrypted copy of your Authenticator accounts in the cloud. The account is encrypted/decrypted inside your phone, so neither Authy or anyone affiliated with Authy have access to your accounts."
Look through the app and options and try to set it up, then verify it, then restore to the new device.

There are some videos on youtube of interdiction officers posted up on major highways in the US giving more attention to the money side of the highways than the drug side. Specifically looking for cash to seize going back to Mexico. They use it to fund their departments if it goes unclaimed, which it usually does.

I use this as the main way to transfer money to people. I just stop in their branch and make a deposit. It's easy. This will really suck. If banks weren't so slow to adapt you could transfer online from one bank to another in a time period of less than 2 weeks. But as it is now it sucks and just gives people another reason to use bitcoin.

As an outsider to all of this drama, I guess I don't get it. What did people expect him to do with the donations, just clear them out of the account at a frantic pace on bullshit expenses as quickly as they came in?

Blocking access to people buying or selling bitcoins in the US seems like it would have a bigger impact on bitcoin than blocking people from buying drugs with bitcoin. Just a hunch though. There were and are many other underground markets that absorbed the business from the SR shutdown. Something like Coinbase is operating above the board and with the blessing of the US government. They've spent a lot of money and done a lot of work to play by the rules. If the government shut them down most average people would only have localbitcoin to turn to to even get in or out of BTC. If they started running controlled buys from sites like that and busting people in person while trading (for whatever reason), it would have a huge chilling effect on the exchange business.
A bigger impact than shutting down a single drug market in my opinion.

How? You're in Ukraine, and desperately need money for whatever. Someone in the US sends you $5000 worth of bitcoin. Terrific. Now what?
There is a cash shortage, so who is going to buy your bitcoin? You'll have to find someone willing to give up whatever it is you want, for bitcoin. Why would they do that? What will *they* do with the bitcoin?
I love bitcoin, but I don't see how it helps here.

How do you mean? I wasn't trying to say anything too profound or controversial here, just that shutting those down or blocking access from the US would create some big hurdles for those of us in the US. 
I could see it having an impact on price, and certainly on any future from average users looking to make purchases online or pay bills.

I was at a strip club and just assumed they had high fees, but admittedly didn't look. Worried that I might want more money later and thinking I was being smart, I withdrew the max amount. Only to find out it was a 10% fee, and not a flat rate like every other ATM I've ever used. $30 withdrawal fee.

I understand that, and agree. Before that can happen though you need to get your landlord/mortgage company, the electric company, water company, cell phone providers, ISP, gas stations and grocery stores on board. Never mind all of the silly shit people spend money on outside of those things. Which happen to be some of the early adopters right now. Coffee shops, bars, etc. 
While I do believe that's possible, I don't believe it's very relevant to the current situation in Ukraine.

Have you contacted support? Do you see the withdrawal in your transaction history?
The site seems kind of shady to me, but people have a ton of money on there. Some guy was playing with a million dollars on there the other day. Made me less worried about my little stash.
Sorry about your loss. Hopefully support can at least figure out what happened. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 01:22:59
I would think for most in person transactions the price would just be shown in local currency. You scan the QR with your phone, and your phone shows you the USD price/BTC price and asks for confirmation. You press OK and it's done. 
The retailer has their money without having to pay off Visa/Mastercard for the privilege of the transfer and you have your item. 
Maybe BitPay or someone links addresses to accounts for people who choose to opt-in, so your phone shows you "You're about to send $5/.8mBTC to Subway DENVER, CO - Is this OK?"
There is a lot of fear about sending off $200 to 1jk234hkjh34893489dfjkh23489dm234234. And even more when it's .278373322 Bitcoins. Is that $200? $2000? $2? Who knows.

That thread made me wonder what the best option is for placing an anonymous bet with someone online. 
Like 2 people on a forum, or reddit disagree, and want to bet on it. They choose a trusted 3rd party to arbitrate and all are given a key. 2 of those 3 keys being entered in favor of a judgement would declare that party the winner. 
So the two people could agree that Party A won, and it would go through, but if Party B was a bad sport and refused to release funds, the 3rd party could step in and declare Party A the winner still. Maybe after 24 hours or something. 
I don't know, just something I was thinking about from that thread. It probably wouldn't get a ton of use, but it would be fun. You could set up a point system if you wanted to, or odds, or all kinds of other little things.

I bought 17 coins for around $130 on Mt Gox, and then a year later remembered them and had to reset my password, I was so happy to see they were worth $30 something at that point and sold them to some shady BTC to Amazon Credit site and got like $250 when it was all said and done. Haha, oh well.... 
I remember reading about a big price dip, and thinking I should buy some at $7 since it's so low but didn't have much money to spare on a silly idea. And I would have sold them all later anyway even if I had. I never would have dreamed they'd be worth $1000.

If you bought one of these ATMs and just plugged it into the corner of your coffee shop in the US and posted some ads online and just let it go.
How would that likely play out, legally? From a legal perspective is selling "bitcoins" any different than selling credits on a jukebox, or WoW gold?
Would the legal risk only come from dispensing cash, or is taking cash also questionable?

The hardest thing when jumping into something like this is not finding good information, but finding the *latest* good information.
You might read about some wallet, website, or other thing and think you are on the right track only to read later that the community lost confidence in it after it was hacked or sold to a scammer, or who knows what else.
Without some kind of "best practices" wiki, or similar, you end up having to wade through a lot of forum or reddit posts to get a feel for what people are using and trusting currently.
