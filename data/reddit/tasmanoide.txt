Normally in a face to face exchange you have certain amount of trust. In case there isn't you can simply make a transaction at the blockchain through hardware wallet, mobile phone, etc.
In case you don't want to make the transaction (privacy concerns, for example) then there is space for OpenDime, but I don't expect a huge use of it unless btc really becomes a successful settlement system with very high fees.

You can start with a little purchases to get more confidence. Bad thing is that with high btc tx fees now it's not very likely that someone will trade for 50$ or so.
Best practices:
- Basic bitcoin wallet good practices (paper seed, file backup, good password).
- Fill the payment method form in "account". Make sure you can use it, limit trades and fees.
- Send btc to Bisq account, considering trade, deposit and miner fees and wait for confirmation.
- Study your market and put (or accept) an order. Something like 0.5% Bitcoinaverage price is usually good.
- Make sure that the protocol is followed, and follow the protocol.
The most important:
When sending money, always complete all the necessary details (use the exact bank account you have for this trade, complete the name, exact import of trade, and exact reference number and only the the reference number, nothing else).
When receiving money, check that all of the above matches, and if you find something smelly don't push the "payment received" button. Open a dispute and explain any detail you think is worth to pay attention to.
I opened a dispute today because I received a "reason for payment" like this: "I824thx happy new year". Do not mention btc or anything else. Just put the required payment number.

You only have bank or exchange's debt, that 99.9% of times are paid in time, but it doesn't make the money they're holding yours. 
What you have is debt, not money.
Anyway, I know there are reputedly economists defending mine and your point of view, so I suppose none of us are really missing the point.
Especially in Bitcoinland, I think it's very important to note that the numbers that exchanges are showing are not real money, it's just a debt that exchanges should pay.
@_date: 2018-01-06 09:18:32
You pay fiat straight to your trading pair, not to Bisq.
Then btc is sent to buyer (held on a 2/3 multisig address), when seller says that she received the fiat payment.

- Fill your bank data (TOR hidden and only shared with your trading peer, also moderator but only in case there's an issue during the trade.
- Accept or create an offer, send the necessary amount of btc for it.
That's all. Nobody has to verify. You can create or accept an order in a few minutes, which is nothing compared to centralized exchanges, including the time needed for fiat to move from your account to exchange's account, and backwards.

I recommend it a lot.
@_date: 2018-01-06 12:35:13




That's true. Like any decentralized and P2P stuff, it depends on local laws. No problems with that yet, but it's something to consider .


I don't think bank accounts are more critical than Bitcoin public keys. You share it with a lot of people.


Banks need to improve their security protocols. Is it your fault that someone doesn't protect their bank password good ennough? Anyway, Bisq have partial solutions to this. Limits on max offer that gets higher with the longevity of the account.
About three-way scams, again it's the craiglist what is failing on the security protocol level. You can show Bisq logs as evidence about what you did.
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:58:11


That's a reason why accepting that kind of trade is not a good idea, but I get your point. In fact, Bisq is considering to have some kind of reputation system, like the already implemented age account check.
F2F transactions offer only a reputation based model that can be easily cheated. You can be robbed and this kind of things.
Centralized exchanges are like banks. They offer the same good and bad things like any bank, but you have to add that we are facing a very young industry where lots of bad things can happen.
Bisq has its good things like no central place to steal coins, and bad things, like a yet unknown legal status when there are issues.

Unfortunately btc tx fees makes trades under something like 500$  illogical.
BSQ (DAO Bisq coin) and segwit implemented will mitigate a little this. And there's also the possibility to trade Fiat/LTC and dash.
Bisq needs fees to maintain and to prevent spam. But these are low nowadays.

Bisq doesn't publish any swift code.
Btc seller adds his payment method address before placing an offer. Buyer too. Only buyer and seller knows this data unless moderation is needed. If moderation is needed, to be able to moderate, this info (bank accounts, name, etc) is shared with moderators.

Basically, you fill a form with the data of the payment method you want to use, make an order or take an existing one, send btc to the multisig address created by Bisq, receive usd in your bank (buyer will press its "payment send" button) and finally you press the payment received button to release btc

More than 40 trades. Only 3 open disputes. All of them satisfactory, but slow.
You have to get used to it and change your mind because Bisq is a different thing. On one hand no KYC so the open account process takes a few minutes and you don't have to explain why do you want to withdraw the fiat and wait for someone to send it to you. On the other, your peer might make the trading process slow or arbitrators could not answer in 24 hour.

Another idea:
Hexadecimal electrum seed, (encrypted with sha 256 and base64)[

Fiat becomes more expensive to be hold into bank and inflation should be around 2% but is unknown, while btc is free to hoard and inflation is predictable and known (about 4% after halving and decreasing).

I don't get the point of this. It makes more or less what a simple paper wallet does but costs a lot more.
Face to face transactions normally involve a certain amount of trust, so a paper wallet with encrypted QR (or not) could be good ennough.
You can make copies of your paper wallet so losing or breaking it is not a problem.
For other cases, like no trust involved in face to face transactions, I think a trezor is better. And smartphone wallets are better too.
The only point is that you really don't want to have the transaction registered in the blockchain. That is the only real big advantage of OpenDime.

There's still a third party, but it doesn't control the 3d key of the 2of3 multisig. Now it's 2of2.
The arbiter third party, in the rare cases which is needed, makes the BTC payout from its pocket and then asks for DAO reimbursement. 
Previous to that phase there's a chat between traders and also, if required by a peer, the moderator, who proposes a payout that both traders have to agree with, or then (I insist, that has to be very rare) the deposits are sent to a DAO address and arbitration starts.

Removing the power of the arbitrator had doesn't faces the chargeback risk, but helps decentralization of the platform. 
This is how Bisq faces chargeback risk, which is inherent to fiat payment methods (stablecoins are not fiat and face their own risks):
Bisq only accepts payment methods that are supposed to be hard to chargeback, like bank transfers. There's trading limits that are raised gradually only in the case that the account already made a successful trade before. Another security measure is on its way, which is the possibility of verifying two payment methods under the same name (scammers only take control from one account of the same person).

Now I'm more used to mBTC or bitcoins, but I also understand what's a bit and I can use it too. The way you're calling bitcoins will depend on what you're measuring. It's not the same when you are buying a computer (you'll preffer to use BTC or mBTC sounds nice) or a bar meal (mBTC) or how many fees-micropayments on LN, where bits can be used. Won't have many sense to use bits to tell the value of a house, for example, not today nor in the very distant future.
You do something like this in fiat world. You don't take the same kind of bills-coins, depending on if you're going to buy a motorbike, clothes or candy. It makes sense for me to nominate your cold wallet in BTC while you use mBTC or bits for your smartphone wallet.

From what I see in the picture, there might be a bug. Normally you can see the block explorer link to see the transaction that has to be confirmed, and you can't. That happened to me in the past. If it's already 12 hours since you saw the "wait for blockchain confirmation" then I think it's time to open a support moderation ticket. It's better to open it yourself now than wait the 8 days because that's a way of showing some interest in complete the trade and have a honest behavior.
You have to type Ctrl + O to open call the mod.
Don't worry if it's a bug, then you have to do some things manually but it shouldn't affect the trade very much.

They'll never use KYC (because for knowing your customer you have to be someone, not a protocol) and it's very hard they'll change the way they're doing the platform to go to a reputation based system.
Multisigna has a reputation system and maybe it's a better option for easily charback payment methods, but anyway, I think that the problem is on the method of payment, not in the exchange you are using. If you can't trust the payment method you are using, I would recommend you to stop using that method as soon as possible.

You could also pay fees not trying to disrupt the service and the result would be the same as a DDoS. We cannot know the source of the transactions, so we don't know if it's an evil corp trying to disrupt bitcoin or 100.000 indians trying to escape Modi's restrictions to fiat.

There is no reputation system. It just counts how many trades have you made with someone. 
The system has no memory, so it's not possible to remember the trades other people have done. It might sound as something bad, because the first time you find someone, you don't know if he's godd or evil. The good point is that sybil or long con attacks are not possible.

Your peer has to confirm to Bisq that she has the payment in her fiat account. You just need patience, Bisq is not the fastest method to buy or sell, although it can be very smooth in some cases (I've completed some trades in 24h). I would open a dispute after 48-72 hours from the time where the fiat payment must be displayed on your peer account.
A dispute will be opened automatically after the trade period is finished anyway.
But at the moment, nothing to worry about, just a lazy and not very cooperative peer you're dealing with.

It's a case of prisoner's dilema. You can try to not get the fees of one block to increase the general level of fees, but at the next block, the next miner will be more tempted to get these higher fees.
Even if the assumption that resulting profit is "shared" by all the miners is true, the cost of overloading the mempool is assumed only by the pools that are mining empty blocks.

It's difficult to have privacy and security on easy to revert payment methods like bank credit and debit cards. Is it Bisq's or bank's fault? Bisq is thinking about new trade protocols that could solve what I believe is a bank generated problem.
The objective of mobile app is only to inform, and I don't think there's huge problems to make it work. Its functionalities are reduced (you need the desktop client online and can't create, take offers, nor sign transactions)  but it makes the job, which is provide relevant alerts.
@_date: 2019-06-25 17:27:21
I think none of you have read very much about Bisq. You can start [here](
Are there scams? Yes. It's true that arbitrator will send your coins and maybe deposit fee if someone says that a payment is made and isn't. In fact, that doesn't happen because it's quite easy to prove that a bank transfer has or not been made. But there's the possibility of chargebacks, which have happened in the past and claim number 2 from DryEagle makes sense (number 1 is related to chargeback risk, is an urgency measure for btc buyers that will be removed as soon as possible). Bisq assumed sepa and most of bank transfers are very hard to reverse, and used this instead of, for example, paypal. But there's been chargebacks with bank transfers too, so the system has to change a little bit, a mix between deposits and reputation is getting ready.

This limit applies to buy only as a security measure because fiat bank transfers are not reliable (chargebacks with stolen bank accounts). For selling fiat/btc and other payment methods like face to face there are no such limits.

@_date: 2019-12-23 08:50:23
BTC seller locks BTC trade amount and deposit, and buyer locks BTC deposit to a 2of2 multisig address.
BTC buyer sends fiat to seller's bank account, and indicates in the Bisq software that the fiat has been sent.
BTC seller checks that the payment and payment reason is correct and tells Bisq software that the fiat payment has been received.
BTC trading amount goes to buyer and deposits are returned.
You need btc to buy btc.
If one of the parts doesn't pay, you have a chat to try to know why, then a moderator makes a payout suggestion, and if one or both traders doesn't agree with that suggestion, all the locked funds are sent to a DAO address.
Then, arbitrator judges the situation and makes a payout. In example, if BTC buyer forgets the trade and never pays fiat, loses its deposit and seller gets his btc and deposit back.

If you're making a bank transfer trade it's mandatory.
First, I wouldn't trust making 5 transfers at the same bank account at the same time. That lowers risk.
Second, all the scammed people could join evidence and present it to law.

You don't have to cash out because every trade is made between pairs, so no cash in. 
You lock bitcoins to a 2/3 multisig account, then receive a tx to your bank account, and then bitcoins are unlocked to btc buyer.

This is supposed to be a subreddit with serious answers.
If you used a strong password, there's no way at this time to crack your password. That's why you put the password, if it was easy to break it, it would be useless.
Try finding your seed, which you should have written somewhere in paper, or wait until it's possible to crack this password.

What about privacy? Having to explain why do you want to withdraw your money or who you're going to trade with is not something worth?
On the other hand, you're supposing that storing btc by oneself is the same as having cash at home and it can be very different. You can have a paper wallet inside a safe, which is similar to a safe, or you can use a hardware wallet with passphrase, or even a multisig account where extorting a single person will be useless.
And, why do you assume that the bank is going to protect your btc?  (or even have any at all) 
There's people who feels safer giving their coins to a bank but that doesn't mean that they truly are.

Don't save seed nor priv keys online. If you save seed there's no need to save private keys.
Put seed on a paper an keep it safe. Use  to split the seed and give a part of the seed to very trusted ones either.

I've made a cold wallet with electrum. It's quite easy but I still have a doubt:
I want to know if the cold wallet needs to be updated with new addresses or it's enough to sign transactions from the seedless wallet.
Cold wallet only shows a few addresses because they're always offline. As they don't know which addresses have been spent, there's no need to search for more addresses in the client but that feels weird.

Now I understand your point ,and it's something that could be done, but:
- Seller would need to be identified anyway. Maybe he doesn't mind and as long as there are no records of trading it will be difficult for someone to estimate how much money were traded.
- No reputation system would be involved, because lack of trading records. That's not a big deal, as it can be easily manipulated.
- Better than phone, I would publish a disposable mail. I don't like having my phone number open online for anyone.
In the end, a really decentralized face to face exchange is needed. Bisq and OB are very good approaches to what we need. Even with your proposed method, it would be a matter of time for localbitcoins to ban traders suspicious of operating this way or to hide offers if you're not verified as well.

LN leaves free space for on chain transactions removing some payments from the blockchain, so transactions shouldn't be more expensive. Transactions won't be slower because blocks will still be created every 10 minutes.
You would have to receive your first incoming transaction on-chain. If the fee was 5$ then you won't be buying 20$, but if the fee is 10 cents then you wouldn't mind. More or less like now,.

IMO is not worth. It has some advanced options but they are difficult to use, and I preffer electrum, a light client with advanced options like cold wallets easy to use. For a daily light wallets are better, unless you need some specific option.
I have a bitcoin core node too, because I want to help to maintain the network, but I don't use it any more as a wallet. Was annoying beeing unable to spend my bitcoins when the block chain wasn't updated.

Try Bitsquare, a P2P exchange focused in privacy. Not too much liquidity but you can create it though.
@_date: 2015-11-04 10:05:15
Bitfinex and Multisigna aren't P2P, because the platform relies on centralized servers. If they go down, the users can't set prices.
But Multisigna is a step ahead for decentralization, because the money doesn't need to go through them, the transactions are made directly between users via SEPA and multisig bitcoin transactions.
For me, have to wait two days to finalize a transaction is very fair, because at the end of the transaction you'll have real money in your fiat or bitcoin account, not just a number on a screen that says that the exchanges owe you something that maybe they don't have.

As a very optimistic about Bisq and long time follower and trader without any problems, being able to use cash to trade is still very important and Bisq is not providing that at the moment.
In fact, I feel like openbazaar is in better position to achieve this goal. With a certain hastag to look for offers and a map to see nearest trader it would be ennough.

If you are worried about someone accessing your seed, split your seed in two or three parts and keep them in different places.

Have you read they only keep 3% of "our"money in cash?
Do you feel more or less secure? Are you sure that banks exist to keep cash secure?

Which wallet? 
@_date: 2015-10-27 09:40:11
Electrum is not a mobile (smartphone) wallet.
OP's asked to hold large amount of bitcoins, not "many currencies". And no, I did not use Coinomi. It's the first time I hear about that.

Bitcoin already made great achievements, but I think that, as other opensource projects, is in a perpetual beta phase.

There's no such thing as "local exchange website". I can access to a lot of different exchanges, even some foreign ones.

If you use this method, be very careful chosing the password. I would use more than 30 characters, playing with upper and lower letters, some numbers, strange symbols (*,+-!) and illogical sentences and grammar.
NEVER choose a song or a poem, nor a book paragraph.

Zero. Sending your transaction through the nodes (0 confirmations) and writing the transaction into a block (1 confirmation) are different things. The first is done instantly. The second needs the recommended fee or a solidary miner. If you set a high fee your transaction will be with very high probability at the first block mined.

No, I don't remember [this](  hacked poker room. I didn't even know bitcoin in 2012.
Anyway, I supposed it was not the first in time, I wanted to mean the leader, the most important poker room.
I'm sorry because english is not my first language and I have some difficulties trying to explain myself.

I use an almost P2P exchange that doesn't touch neither bitcoin nor fiat. They do it through 2 out of 3 multisignature, if everything is right they don't intervene. If not, they act as a judge, sending the bitcoins to the fair participant of the transaction.
@_date: 2015-10-07 21:38:31
I like electrum. Secure, easy to use, and hiding the mnemonic seed in a safe way makes me feel comfortable about loosing the wallet or forgetting the password.
@_date: 2015-10-09 17:13:47
I expect the price and adoption will explode soon, but I've been expecting that since I'm into bitcoin. So don't believe me, because nobody knows.
You already made something big being able to save 1btc. Few years ago, and even today, it's very strange to see people of your age saving so much for the future, and worrying about their future economy.

It will be fun when btc banks report they have over 21M btc in their accounts.

It can be even more confusing.
How many btc do I have if I have 1 private key of a 2/3 multisig address with 1btc? 0, 0.33, 0.5, or 1 btc?
It's fun, fun, fun to be lawyer at these times!
Anyway, on my previous comment I didn't think that multisig makes fractional reserve harder because the bank can't lend to someone bitcoins without the co-signing partners noticing.

PayPal is like an old version of Bitcoin that only works with a virtual currency and a lot of bureocracy, isn't it?
@_date: 2016-07-21 10:48:05
Which doesn't mean they are doing the right.
@_date: 2018-12-02 15:57:29
Government is the one who endangers PayPal, not its users.
PayPal is not protecting from users. They need KYC AML to be protected from the State.

If this were the issue, they should have raised the rake or end some promotions. The room had very good conditions for players. They were improving their software to a very new one, so I think profit its not the matter we're talking about here.
They mention some security reasons, but as in so many questions, I think there will be more rumors than facts. At least they didn't run with the money.
e: excuse my bad english.

He wanted us to celebrate something special and party hard every 4 years, like the Olympic games, and spend all the money we won hodling so there will be no possibility to fall into a deflationary spiral.

What about ETFs?
And we need a wider time window. There's no capacity to take out and in all btc from exchanges in one day.

I expected to buy my Trezor, with BTC, when the price was again at 1000$. I bought it last week.
@_date: 2018-12-11 15:12:32
OP just have to put a buy order that attracts a seller. Maybe a 3% premium against the buyer will be enough.
There's a lot of btc holders on Bisq so it's not easy to find sellers. And there's too many payment options in USD so it's a small and divided market. Patience is needed, it pays off.

They use a fixed price that changes every minute according to fiat volatility.

No they won't. You're a speculator only when you win in the markets. Otherwise, you're one of these poor victims of speculators and government needs to protect you.

I've used it in EUR to buy som btc. There were a 5% spot because there are a lots of holders there. So I put an order at 0% and I waited for a day or so until there was sell offer at a price that I liked. I pick that one and that's all I needed. The exchange was perfectly fine.
Now they launched a new version with UI improvements and beta test for the DAO.
So, people heard about Bisq very often.

Why do you want to use a Trezor in a offline computer? Trezor was made to be used btc in any pc. Your keys are protected by the hardware wallet.

Not necessary to do it every year, but I like the idea. Every 4, 5 or 10 years would be enough.
