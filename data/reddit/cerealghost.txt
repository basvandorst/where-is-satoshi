I like to recommend pools that pay per share with nearly no fees. There is no gambling involved and you get the full value of each share submitted. My favourites are still [eligius.st]( and [arsbitcoin](

Withdrawals are a bit pricey at $6 each but it's extremely convenient. You can set up direct deposit and the money shows up in your bank account the next day.

I really don't understand people's complaints about efficiency. It's entirely efficient, and the effort put in to each block is completely self-correcting. 
The efficiency is entirely a product of demand for new coins. For a long time, the difficulty of mining was 1, but we value a block infinitely more since then.
You can't think about the network in terms of cost per transaction. The cost per transaction is zero (plus whatever transaction fees you elect to pay). It doesn't *cost* $7 per transaction (or whatever the electricity cost is now), the value of the network is *growing* by that amount.
@_date: 2012-03-07 22:39:23
I mine on a pool (eligius.St). That way I get paid per share every few days instead of on a random 2-6 week gamble.

I've tried selling it for more with no luck. I've seen similar rigs on here before for this price, so I'm hoping I'll be able to make a sale.
I'm only selling because I'm moving in to a new apartment that cannot fit as many miners as I currently have.

I should add one more thing: any new addresses you generate will not present in your old backed up wallet, which is why it's useful to back it up regularly if you make new addresses often.

The two reasons I discourage deepbit are the high fees (3-7% depending on the payout type) and also that joining deepbit raises the probability of a hypothetical [blockchain fork]( that is pretty much the only weakness of the bitcoin protocol.

One thing to understand is that the bitcoins are not actually stored on your computer. As long as you have the private key to your address (this is stored in wallet.dat, found in %appdata%/Bitcoin) you can access the coins from anywhere.
You can think of bitcoin kind of like a public ledger, where everyone knows the balances of every wallet. Anyone with the password (private key) to a wallet can spend the balance.
Long story short, if you securely back up your wallet.dat, you will always have access to your bitcoins even if your hard drive goes kaput.

Probably, the best thing you could possibly do for bitcoin is start accepting them at your place of business (if you're in charge), or convince another local merchant to start accepting them. 
Actually, scratch that. The best thing you could do is *make it easier* for merchants to accept bitcoin. Depending on how much "a bunch of money" is, and if you can come up with a decent business model, it may be worthwhile developing merchant tools to help people accept bitcoins all over the world.

no, i don't use my cpu. The cpu adds like 5MH and makes everything annoyingly slow. At least with just the GPUs going I can still have a functional computer. 
I've made a few hundred dollars, but I'm still well below breaking even on the cost of the hardware. I actually just cancelled another 4x5830 rig coming in this week because the payoffs have been shrinking.
@_date: 2011-06-17 21:36:43
Okay, this data is difficult to understand. I'm still not sure what's going on, but I made some charts.
Look at these images:  toggle between them quickly to see the change. Block 512 was found on June 12 (before the difficulty increase), and Block 688 was found today (june 16th). There's an *increase* in the percentage of people submitting work with a value less than 0.001% of a block. 
However, the richest contributors are not quite as exclusive as the were before. Last week, the top 10% of contributors took home 16.2% of the wealth. This week, the top 10% of contributors take home 13.6% of the wealth. 
Still not sure what this means, if it means anything.

It adds redundancy and additional coins, since each block increases the total number of btc by 50. It does not speed up transactions.

After btc hit 6, it dropped down to 4.50.
Then after btc hit 9, it dropped down to 6.
Then after btc hit 15 it dropped down to 13.
Then after btc hit 19, it dropped down to ~15.
Now after btc hits 30 it drops down to 22. 
This is a normal cycle, and if anything it indicates a good time to buy. Don't just sell, don't just hold, buy more.

What would make me most hesitant to use this service is that it's very difficult (impossible?) to find out what the service costs. What's your cut of the transaction? Is it free?

Agreed. If one person has $1000 USD and another person has $1000worth of bitcoins, who's going to have an easier time getting their money out? Certainly not the one who has to wait 1-3 days for a dwolla transfer.
@_date: 2011-08-15 00:17:38
At its lowest difficulty, bitcoin only requires one share to be completed.
I user 4.2 kW of power to generate about 6200 shares per hour.
I suppose to extrapolate that down to minimum difficulty while maintaining the minimum 6 blocks per hour required to run the network, you *could* generate a single share verifying all the transactions and balances on with 4 watts for 10 minutes, or 6.7e-4 kWh of energy (worth 1/100th of a penny at the OP's electricity price). 
Everything we add on top of that is due to redundancy and competition for mining rewards.

At a few blocks a month, you'll likely find very little due to fast (1 week) difficulty increases that would render your rigs obsolete. You'd probably want to expect at least 3-6 blocks a week, for which you'd *currently* need about 15-30 GH. However, in a couple days this will double to ~30-60 GH.
@_date: 2011-07-21 12:21:36
Currently about 3-4 months.

@_date: 2011-06-17 19:36:35
You've built an interesting narrative. However, I'd disagree that casual miners are leaving en masse. 
Looking at the average ratio of shares submitted per user over at btcguild.com, the average user is doing less work per bitcoin now (0.029% of a block) than they were before the difficulty increase (0.036% of a block), indicating a greater number of miners with below-average hash rates. I'll look at this data a bit more carefully when I get home.
Also: fateful day, not faithful day. :P
@_date: 2011-06-28 22:07:22

No, not a massive sale. It appears that *every buy order in the books* was simultaneously filled. 
This does *not* mean that someone sold hundreds of thousands of btc, or that anyone managed to buy btc at &lt;$1 prices.
It *probably* means that some database error occurred, or someone hacked mtgox to mark all orders as filled.
**None of these orders likely happened.** New orders are continuing at 15-16$.

Virtex makes it incredibly easy to add and withdraw canadian dollars. As far as I know, with MtGox in order to make a withdrawal you must go through Paxum, which is very slow and expensive. 
I've been using Virtex since the day it opened, and there really is nothing easier in my experience. 
The one advantage MtGox has is that you can buy or unload large quantities much more quickly than on Virtex.

Sorry, but I really think that's a bad idea. If you're financially motivated to mine, then you want to do everything you can to minimize your risk and maximize your profit per share submitted.
You're right that switching to smaller pools raises trust issues. However, those are largely negated on the two pools I know of that use SMPPS (ArsBitcoin and Eligius.st). You know in advance exactly what a share is worth, and you don't even have to pay a fee to the pool (except the transaction fees, which are &lt;0.1%).
Solo mining for a few days, even if you have a dedicated 1GH miner, has a very large probability that you will not get a single dime for your work.
@_date: 2011-07-28 20:04:04
So you have money!
@_date: 2011-08-12 18:55:05
I think it's important to point out that what you're describing is not the cost of **bitcoin transactions**, this is the cost of **bitcoin mining**. It does not cost $4.20 per transaction. It cost $216 ($1297/6) to generate a block of 50 btc. 
The transactions cost nothing. Even if 99.9% of all the mining activity stopped, the **same number of transactions** could still happen without a problem even though the cost of running the network would be pennies per hour.
@_date: 2011-06-24 13:11:32
Now to get 1 bitcoin you need to run approximately 1.5GHps for 24 hours.

No, just two. I have the four 5830s running on a single MSI 790FX-GD70 --- the cheapest motherboard i could find with 4 double-side PCI-E slots. They stay cool enough, even overclocked with the (antec one hundred) case closed, so I think it's a pretty good budget solution.

Sure you made many times more in quantity, but not in value. If you had been mining bitcoins and then selling those bitcoins for namecoins, you would have three times as many namecoins.
Until the BTC:NMC exchange rate matches or exceeds the BTC:NMC mining difficulty ratio, it's not worthwhile to mine NMC.

Yep, you're correct! However, as long as even one person on the whole network is mining, all the transactions will go through.
The computing power required to process transactions - the difficulty - adjusts according to how many people are mining on the network. The point is to keep blocks being solved at a constant rate, no matter how many people are mining. 
A year ago there were 1/1000th as many people mining as there are now. However, blocks were still being solved at the same rate, because the difficulty was 1000 times lower.

So "efficiency" usually describes how little of the consumed power is lost to heat, rather than useful work. Since for a heater the useful work *is* heat, all electric heaters are 100% efficient (assuming you don't care where in the immediate environment the heat ends up).
addendum: Then why not use electric heaters everywhere? Because per joule of heat, other sources such as natural gas are cheaper.
