How does it feel that you will NEVER become rich.
I shudder to think of your aforementioned situation
It must be Hell

Try this example: Gold Coins can work, because they have intrinsic value. 
Now you're saying: "We can replace those with styrofoam coins. Because it's a matter of social agreement."
I say: No. People would immediately start gypping: "hehe Now I'm supposed to treat these styrofoam coins like they are precious... But I won't. I'm breaking social norms for personal gain hehe."

My plan for dominating the universe entails not simply me having money, but others not having it.
So I want to thank you for your gigantic losses on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, which have made you into my serf.

Is it because you wanted Riches, but are too Lazy to make it other than from Rentseeking by just Watching Quotes?
Prepare for another 75 years of dire poverty then

I never bought any cryptos, that would be an amateur move.

When you are the world's greatest economist, and history's wealthiest person, as I am, then it is all a breeze.

I'm just trying to get through your Thick head, but you still believe in santa claus a.k.a. bitcoin

You have a lot in common with those newbs.
Namely you expect Moon still, when in fact the only O shape in store is 0

It seems that Cryptos are an invention for destroying money.
If you have $4000 then this Andreas Andronopoluos invention can reduce your net worth to $300.
Couldnta happened to a better bunch, because these idiots were namecalling others when times were good back in winter.

Why, are you hoping to find a Greater Fool to buy them off you for more?
Perhaps you are the greatest fool, and everyone else in the world bids even less.
Then watchu gonna do, as Run DMC asked.

Only a select few like Dr. Craig Wright a.k.a. Nakamoto
The rest of you have spent all your parents' 40 years of workcelling in a month

So how many millions of dollars have you made through Bit Coin so far
Don't tell me I want to guess. Zero

So, if you sunk $100,000 into a piece of toilet tissue, you would defend that by saying "1TP=1TP"

Do you remember when you "invested" $950 into bitcoin in January 2018 when it was $15,000
Your dad said: "Hey, I think this is risky as heck."
You responded: "You don't get the new tech. It is a block chain, you see. It has cryptographic hash ecosystem. Halkvinge and Vorheese said it's going to $1,000,000 by next month."
Today, you have difficulty affording dishwasher maintenance liquids at thesupermarket.

That is really not the problem. If bitcoin confirmed in 1 microsecond, it would still be worthless.
Why, because the recipient of a bitcoin gets Nothing.
That is what is contained on a bitcoin, namely. Nothing of value.

Basically if you like money, you have to spend many decades working at it.
This dedication then shines through and you become a billionaire.
However crypto buyers of 2017 were wet behind their ears, and refused to listen to old sages and wise owls.
"Ha, ha, ha!" was their response when greats warned that $19,750 would soon become $3,401.

It's not really a matter of agreement. If it was agreement, people would break their word left and right.
The reason money works, is that it has value. Not a matter of honoring an agreement. (i.e. "I know this coin is worthless, but I gave my word." No.)

You are now the 1%
