Ha, ha. Yes, a " Plan B " shirt and a barcode of my private key to my hot wallet I figured. Seriously, I have had a great week I need more liquidity.We think we are going to launch , a LBC ad as the software is now fully integrated with Bitstamp, and Bitnik reload. 
  No costume needed, only ability to count satoshi. :)

Wow, actually I am not going to be getting any boots tonight , I been up for 38 hours trading. Launching the many products and services I have been squatting on. I feel like a POSER , in the official r/bitcoin forum. 
 Lol, I am a CEO of 3 Blockchain companies. As well as running a bitcoin ATM company. I'm ecstatic as a all in Guy from the 2013 area. They made a lot of coin around the PAYCON ERA, selling my imaginary miners, lol.  I am humbled, and proud to be a actual piece of the complex and life changing crypto cavemen club. 
 It's about time for the 1000 spot, again it's worth double that ideally suited for a few niche markets.
  I hope this finds you well....
  MINE-FLIP-Pump-Hold-Arbitrage- I'm sleeping with my Treznor tonight. Merry Christmas and a happy new year MOON !

Absolutely NOT a chance. You're smarter than most other IS exposing coin base heads lol.
 I live BATM , I flew to Dallas TX to get a  RIDICULOUS SEXY BITX ATM pay me 700$ in crispy C notes.
  I'm now waiting on a order of 12, it was the most exciting and almost felt like " looking at porn" hoping Nobody busts down the door. ( Really )
  Life is so much more than HOW MUCH YOU NEED TO KNOW,  it's what you want to do. 
  For me I hate going through the motions, online buying bitcoin. 
  I applaud your E E E towards the pursuit of an issue with the mass adoption.  Oh : Energy Excitement Enthusiasm.    
Ps.  Was she as good as you had imagined her to be, you know what I mean. When you put something in and got rewarded with the better version... ��
