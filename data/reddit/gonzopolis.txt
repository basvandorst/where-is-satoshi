But tipping on reddit is mostly marketing. You're selling the idea of bitcoin to potential users. Changetip collects fees, makes a profit. It doesn't matter if the tippers are hired at a marketing department or if it's crowdsourced to for free.

That's in the wiki and also in the article you linked. However I can't find it in that form in the current codebase (that's also linked in the article). It seems to me that timestamps are ignored (with the exception for timestamps that are more than 2 hours in the future. Those are invalid).

Amazon always tries to advertise some stupid debit/credit card where you get something like €20 on sign-up. That's not enough for me to care reading all the conditions but for their marketing department it obviously is a threshold where they expect results.
Just as a comparison. On reddit you can just upvote a post to show your support. Tipping €0.50 is as useful as replying with 'This' and should be against reddiquette IMHO.

You can map IP address ranges to certain geolocations. I'm don't know how the site can be sure from which IP a transaction was first broadcasted from. But the node has more than 1000 connections so any guess would be quite accurate.

As soon as a transaction has been confirmed in **one** block, it doesn't have to be accepted by the next mined block in that chain. That means that after the **first** confirmation you would have to **a)** bet on that block to become orphaned by chance or **b)** mine the next blocks yourself to create the longer blockchain. With each confirmation it would get **expensiver** to force the double spending. If the transaction got **zero** confirmations then you can't tell if it's going in the blockchain **at all**. AFAIK you wouldn't even need to play around with fees in order to influence which one of your two transaction gets confirmed. Just broadcast the *real* transaction to the major pools and the *fake* transaction to the vending machine. In conclusion, if I understand correctly, you can't trust zero confirmation transactions. You'd have to trust the sender or his green address.

I like it. It's always good to have more than one service. 
But I don't like the choice of units.
* 0.7 BTC
* 5.0E-4 BTC
* 50000 (Satoshi)
The site is using all these three formats and it's really annoying. I know E-4 means 10^-4 = 0.0001 but I'm still confused how much 1 Satoshi is supposed to be.
I prefer SI prefixes.
* 0.7 BTC = 700 mBTC
* 0.0005 BTC = 500 µBTC
@_date: 2011-07-05 22:50:21
I'm pretty sure no exchange would allow a price of 0 even if it's just to prevent a possible division by zero. If it was in fact possible you'd only be able to buy the amount of BTC that are sold at the exchange for that price.

The calculation on that website is flawed. Miners don't report their hashrate. It's calculated via blocks/hour in the network and the *current* difficulty. The average blocks/hour is still high because it has most data from the *last hours*. It's really simple if you think about it.

I made an App Inventor project for that purpose. It reads Bitcoin addresses from QR codes and shows the balance and a link to the blockexplorer page. You can PM me for the project source if you want. It's not on the market yet but you could import it in [App Inventor](
Edit: It's not reading private keys, just the public one and looks it up on blockexplorer. That way you can check the balance of a bitbill really fast.

Salts generally prevent Time-Memory Trade-Off attacks on the hashes (e.g. Rainbow Tables). Your understanding on the slow down of brute force is likely true too, haven't looked into that suspect. But I guess the people who are into Bitcoin have enough GPU power in their rigs to crack most not totally random passwords.
I tested a pattern attack against the ~1600 **unsalted** MD5 hashes in the file and got about 40% of them. Some of them were long enough to be probably never cracked by brute force, but simple enough to be found via common patterns. It took about **5 minutes** on a single HD 5770.

That's really important. A thief might already have your wallet but isn't taking your 0.xx BTC because then you would know it's compromised. That way he can wait for the day you get 100 BTC or what not and steal it. If you create a lot of new addresses (100 I think?), then the newest address wouldn't be covered by the old wallet but he could still steal all the BTC from older addresses.
@_date: 2011-08-14 09:54:04
If he's only giving away 1 BTC per day then he will only get one information pair per day. Also it's really expensive. Every Exchange and every Pool has a lot of IP&lt;-&gt;Bitcoin-Address connecting data. That's just the way it is.
AFAIK if you'd set up enough nodes you'd be able to statistically guess BTC-IP correlations too by measuring the time of transaction broadcasts versus the latency of the connections.

You can't trust any estimate calculations at this time. Wait 50 blocks and look again at much better values.

About 180MH/s without overclocking and 200MH/s at 960Mhz. I read on the wiki that more would be possible but I don't want to change any voltages. Underclocking the Memory doesn't seem to increase my hashrate either.
@_date: 2011-08-26 14:12:02
Also it's the same probability for "offline" and "online" wallets as the client doesn't ask around in the network or searches through the blockchain.

You don't get a block every 10 minutes. It's the average time anyone in the network gets one (12.77 minutes currently). The difficulty (=~ average time to find a block with the same computing power) increases over time too (simplified).
IMHO it would be **way** easier to bring in millions of fake bitcoin clients that don't mine but manipulate transactions. I don't fully understand the whole technical concept yet but it should be possible to separate parts of the legit blockchain.
I think that's really the key vulnerability: Bot clients don't have to invest any computing power or buy btc via exchanges. They could fuck with the distributed database.
Another thought: If you *were* to hold &gt;50% of the combined bitcoin network computing power then you might be able to add new blocks to the chain without telling the rest of the network. Then, after maybe 100 blocks get generated in the known blockchain you simply announce your own secret version of the last 101 blocks. The smaller, legit chain get's discarded and 50.000 totally valid bitcoins are lost.

I suggest SI prefixes. It would be **11,53 µBTC**. Prices would probably adapt to something more friendly anyway without the USD conversion in mind. Once the price has stabilized it won't be a problem anymore to sell something for 9.99 µBTC or 2.95 mBTC over a long period of time.

If I understand correctly the amount of blocks per hour is steady over time (difficulty adapts). When Bitcoin is more widely accepted it means more people will use it to pay for stuff. It's a currency over all. A lot of users with a lot of goods and services they can pay for with BTC. That means the number of transactions per hour goes up. If you connect these two bits of information you can conclude that the amount of transactions per block (and also the total amount of BTC transacted) will rise.

You obviously never ran a GPU miner yourself. The fans go crazy on 100% activity. A *hidden* GPU miner is impossible.
Also everyone should contact you with fake offers. That way you won't know who is sending you a real miner and who is just owning your own machine. I bet 1 BTC that you can't even read a single line of code.

1. Make a bitcoin website; Invite-only at first so people don't think it's a scam ("A scam would allow as much new users as fast as possible, right?")  
2. Pay some (virtual) interest. Just swap around bitcoins from different accounts if someone wants to withdraw all his BTC.
3. Wait for desired amount of BTC in your wallet.
4. Close the site and sell the BTC.
5. Bonus: No real money got transferred. Customers have no way to prove they got ripped off and no chance to find the company.
