But it’s Quebec. Everyone this is so terrible.

I sent some to my ledger before heading out. Kept checking blockchain for confirmation the transaction went through while shopping.
Such a good feeling hodling using a hardware wallet.

I see you are a simpleton as well.

Thanks for the super shady sounding post OP.

It could be argued that Bitcoin and other altcoins are under-performing when compared to the value the market is generating. Without mass adoption and the use of smart contacts value will likely get funneled to new innovation on other platforms.
Vote with your wallet and seek out long term investments in coins or dev groups you feel strongly have a purpose. 
 
Right now I think FOMO and lack of perceived options are the major reasons for the influx of users. Meanwhile, this relative calm may not last past 12/18 with CME's addition of futures. (CBOE was last Sunday)

Go legit and avoid the hassle and fees.

The primary reason is to keep validation of transactions decentralized but I think there is a secondary benefit to whomever hosts the node.

If you were willing to risk it you should have been willing to lose it. Look into dollar cost averaging and Fibonacci retracement to have a plan to sell to limit your risk and take profits.

Give up using PayPal and maybe get a separate bank account to funnel money in to coinbase if you are paranoid.

Are you referring to the action within the last 15-20 minutes?

Are you expecting to sell at the top and rebuy if there is a correction?
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:52:17
Sorta. I see the volume of trades but isn’t a pump called a pump when it inflates price by a more significant price margin than $60?
I’m viewing this through Blockfolio so I may be missing something.

Risk what you are comfortable with when there is a dip and hold to see it grow. 
I’d encourage anyone who sees the benefit of decentralized currencies to invest for the sake of mass adoption.

You'd either regret it or consider your windfall won at too high a risk.
