Google's self driving cars have been autonomously driving for hundreds of thousands of miles, and 100% accident free (except one that was rear-ended by a human, and another while the self driving car was being driven manually)
"In April 2014, the team announced that their vehicles have now logged nearly 700,000 autonomous miles (1.1 million km)"
Source: 
over 1 million kilometers is nothing to laugh at and could hardly be called "infant"

Couldn't they just have a QR image (like the one with a bitcoin inside it) in the torrent with some text underneath saying "please donate bitcoins here"
seems less dodgy that way, and then torrent software is irrelevant (I'm assuming it only works in frostwire)......
As long as you get the magnet from the correct vendor, you're golden. So they would just post it to a verified twitter/facebook/youtube account where everyone can get it. 
Edit: Or even easier, just have the public address in an info.txt file for easy copy pasta and donate.

Time... Line...?
Time is not made out of lines. Time is made out of circles, that is why clocks are round.

It could even have just been flat out replaced with a different tampered unit.

I can't say I've ever had that problem in 7. Mine is always in order of most recently used...

Yes I did try. exactly as you described. I split my chrome tabs into a couple of windows and already had a couple of folders open in explorer, alt tabed in different orders to 'shuffle' them and they were all in the expected position of most recently on top. 
Though you didn't mention 1100 tabs. I can't imagine that having that many html pages cached/in memory can be good. You may want to consider either locally saving important pages as it may be quicker to load from the hdd or just copying down the link and closing the tab.
 
Anyway no need to get angry, I'm only trying to help.

He probably means that when you alt tab it makes all the windows see through, which can be a bit jarring at times. But that is just Aero.

It's spelt THROUGH not Thru. can you please learn to spell, it's all over your post history and is just embarrassing.

Dont open multiple chrome windows? that's why tabs were invented. if explorer windows are an issue you can tab them as well with [Clover 3](
either way mine functions properly so maybe it's an issue with your windows install.

and who wouldn't do that? If they were to run just a few devices they could make a lot of BTC before the difficulty crash when they ship and customers start using them.
