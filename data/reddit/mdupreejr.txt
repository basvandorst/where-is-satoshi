Better find a fast ship, things in Greece are changing fast. There's also already a bitcoin ATM that was just recently launched in Athens.

We couldn't figure out why its not got any up votes at all. I guess that explains it. Must have an army of down vote robots or something.

Denver Bitcoin Center (You can find our address and such on the website). It was our launch party, you may have missed the launch, but there are still many more parties to come!

I never signed anything and was not told unrefundable either. 
The provided half a class and I also want my money back. 
I've contacted them at least 10 times and my emails keep getting sent to the "Finance Department" The only emails i've gotten from Finance Department are about 25 reminders that my installments are due (I paid up front in BTC).
Give me back my BTC you schmucks!

There is 1 at the Big Tomato headshot, however it is only a 1 way Lamassu not a bi-directional BitAccess BTM.
There is bi-dirctional units at Denver Bitcoin Center and Amagi Metals.

Thanks for the support everyone! Hopefully we can save another sucker from making the mistake i did sending them BTC.

We have already taken at least 2 CoinKite units out of operation in the Denver Area.

This is good news.

Was a great party, thank you everybody who attended. Be sure to check out our website at  for more information on what we are up to.

Actually that's good for a Bitcoin event ...

cryptocrypt is a great place, you should try it out before you bash it.

Should stop by the Denver Bitcoin Center, we have a few demo's of stuff that is available out there. We are a non-profit community center located at 747 Sheridan Blvd  We don't actually sell anything here, just educate.
personally I recommend a tablet based solution such as CoinBase or bitpay, the physical terminals (such as CoinKite) tend to be behind in features and way over priced (we have a few coin kite units at Denver Bitcoin Center, but they are not being used).

I'm not sure about the Lamassu machines, but seeing as they are one-way and mine bi-directional, i find that monthly rate to be a bit high. 
@_date: 2014-11-22 02:55:18
A major PITA. It's time consuming, expensive, and the laws aren't well defined. Best to find someone else who has MTL and become an agent.

I own the Bi-Directional ones, the spread is about the same as the 1 way machine is. We charge approx 5% commission ontop if BitStamps price. 
For transactions under $3k you just need to provide a phone number. For transactions $3k to $10k, and ID scan is required. 
These are daily limits.

The machine at Waries Thai in Amsterdam is the first bi-directional ATM in Nederlands and is currently fully operational, give it a try!
@_date: 2014-11-18 23:27:52
Glad to hear you experience was better than mine. Did you order a terminal or two, or 20? Were your units delivered within the promised time frame?
@_date: 2014-11-18 23:48:25
Its not normal to ship things AFTER the promised delivery date. 
Thats the bottom line. They knew when i was leaving town and they promised the machines would arrive within 10 days. In fact they said it would ship out on monday (a couple days after i ordered) but instead wasn't shipped for 13 days.

Glad to hear that you found our community. This is exactly what the Denver Bitcoin Center exists for. 
Glad to hear that your immediate needs were met. We are in the process of switching ATM providers, though the new machine should be in place very soon. 
Thanks for stopping by and know that you are welcome anytime.
