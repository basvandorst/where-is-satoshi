To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Blockchain. The algorithms are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of quantum computing most of the subroutines will go over a typical programmer’s head. There’s also the merkle tree, which is deftly woven into a giant neural network- its personal evolution draws heavily from Charles Darwin's literature, for instance. The miners understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the probabily of these N+1 dice games, to realise that they’re not just transactions- they say something deep about subatomic particles. As a consequence people who dislike Blockchain truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the quantum physics in the complicated string “010101,” which itself is a cryptographic representation to smaller hashes which will be used by quantum processors. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Satoshi Nakamoto’s genius wit unfolds itself on their mining cards. What fools.. how I pity them. ��
And yes, by the way, i DO have a Bitcoin tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the full node owners’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand, at least have some supporting evidence. Nothin personnel kid ��

Yes, but you need a certain microwave.

0.0114 I feel 'rich'.
EDIT: now 0.013-ish thanks to potato guy.

Life is a bubble. So is Bitcoin.

meanwhile on top of Mt. Gox...

I felt like buying at $70. :| eh

Gigahashes. You're going to need a good mining rate to get anywhere now, let alone 3 months ago.

I don't know how far it's going to go, and if I should buy some when it starts to climb again (if it does).
