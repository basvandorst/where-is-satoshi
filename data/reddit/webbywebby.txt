Hi. First start gpumon in root terminal, it will show you some useful info and shortcuts to config files. Usual diagnostic for me is: checking if it has working internet access(you can configure it via tray icon), checking if card is physically fine ... then i usually check if overclocking is a problem. Did you write pool address properly ? like  You can watch it by typing rig ip address in browser or connecting via ssh using something like putty.

Is there some way to be sure that i do not get blocked assuming i am not doing anything illigal and my account is not stolen ? Like not using some deposit/withdrawal methods ?
Getting these papers is somewhat expensive and time consuming, would be better if actions that can lead to SUDDEN request for account verification be listed somewhere.

You forgot  http:// in front of pool address. Low M is low mh/s.

If block size limit is far from reached and 5 largest pools start asking larger transaction fees, no one has to pay them, transactions will simply go through smaller pools. Although getting transaction included in block would take more time it would still work fine.5 large pools wont get much fees and if most transactions go through small pools that pay fees to miners, miners would slowly migrate to them. Also this is only potential problem that's highly unlikely to arise in real world.

Bitcoin network can be upgraded relatively easily via alarm system built in official client. All official clients showing message about network upgrade at start and same message on all important websites = relatively peaceful upgrade to new version with different rules starting at checkpoint that contains everything from old version.

2500mh/s, mining rigs on balcony connected to router over wifi no problem. No idea how many coins, started when they were 30$ :)

you can keep bitcoins at exchanges with physical key security.

Big pools falling isnt anything new, few months ago deepbit had probably more downtime then uptime. Miners switch automatically with current mining softwere. 
Payout is the same everywhere especially with something like smpps which eliminates variation. Actually deepbit has smallest payout of all bitcoin pools because of 3% fee. And some smaller pools share transaction fees.

Some other answers: when/if network grows too much for transactions to fit in current block size limit, it can be increased. Any rules can be changed in new versions if everyone upgrades. Blockchain size will grow over time but there is no need for non-mining clients to have all blockchain, there are light clients for android and pc already that do not download all of it.

alert requires key that only lead developers have and i assume its kept safe.It only displays message, doesnt disable anything. About trusting official servers ... well forum posts with updates are usually signed with gpg key ...

There was actually 10 second or so fork called afair geistgeld. It performed just fine within tiny pump-and-dump economy and died due to huge premine.
