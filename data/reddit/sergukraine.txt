If I now had a couple of bitcoins, I would not have expected 2019 :)) I would have bought an apartment and a car right now
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:46:54
I did not even dream of such big money
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:58:46
Bitcoin does not go anywhere and will grow. And what other crypto currencies will grow so smartly?
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:28:35
I do not need wealth. It's enough for me to buy an apartment for myself and my wife and car. 2BTC is sufficient for this. And I will be the happiest person in the world!
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:45:51
I can invest only $ 10-20 per month. Bitcoin grows every day. And the commission is more than I can beeveate. For me, this is unrealistic
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:14:42
1900 years I will not live)) So it's very very very little for $ 10 a month
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:14:35
Even 0.1 or 0.01 bitcoin for me is very much. That's why I say that bitcoin crypto currency for the rich
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:31:14
I do not invest because I have nothing to invest :))
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:48:04
How much do you get paid?
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:44:19
America does not pay us, why? We live on the verge of poverty and America does not help here
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:32:00
It sounds beautiful)
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:46:29
I know. By the end of 2018, it will be $ 50-60
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:12:17
Yes. This sounds cruel))
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:53:17
I would love to, but my wife and I do not have enough $ 350 to live. My wife and I rent an apartment and for this we give $ 100. The remaining $ 250 remains for us to live. Every dollar in the account. You can save $ 10-20 a month and buy bitcoin)))
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:55:19
Already bought 6000 pieces
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:00:46
And for the commission to pay $ 12 :))
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:33:40
What do you think, what is the maximum price Ripple by the end of 2018?
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:48:21
Would buy))) I'm open to everything new. Enough even $ 1 in 2009 to invest in bitcoin, what would now be with the apartment and car :)
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:00:56
This is very small. To buy an apartment for $ 23,000 I need 23,000 months to buy for $ 10 :))) I will not live so much
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:41:58
It certainly will not be soon)) After all bitkoin every day becomes more expensive, and my earnings and remains $ 350 per month :)
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:35:45
Yes. For 1.2 BTC I can buy my dream)) Maybe someday it will come true
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:16:40
I can not keep up with bitcoin growth. It grows every day, and I can allocate $ 10 only once a month. This is unrealistic
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:46:08
Wow! I would be able to buy 20-30 apartments)))
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:55:17
Wow !!! Incredible money for me. You are a happy man!
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:24:26
I would gladly invest, but there is no such possibility ...
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:55:59
I do not understand what you mean
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:56:09
I borrowed money from a friend for a year
