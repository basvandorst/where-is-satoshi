Yuuup and that will give you five years of advantage. Buy dip Hoddle , take some profit when everything is at all time high, when dip occurs buy some cryptos with your previous profits, HODL, repeat for 5 years.

@_date: 2017-01-05 14:09:40

@_date: 2017-01-05 13:34:41

Most probably trollo
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:24:23
When BCH rise most of all crypto tanks. When btc rises it takes whole market with it.
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:35:38
Thank you.i will watch it.
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:39:37
Didn't know that. Thanx. Where can I read more about this?
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:22:24
There are other coins for transfer speeds. BCH is still slow compared to alts plus its centralised.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:32:43
This was really informative article. Thanks
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:44:20
It's happening?
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:22:02
Ha ha so insecure.he needs that Bitcoin branding to succeed not the underlying technology.
@_date: 2017-11-10 06:13:39
This needs to be higher
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:28:57
Wow good for you. More people start using Bitcoin for shopping and trading less chance of big crash. It will be really amazing if all Venezuelans started using Bitcoin. People's currency.
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:16:51
And difficulty of BCH changed to 1.68 profitable for mining. At the same time Bitcoins with Alts tanked and BCH rose. Typical BCH market manipulation as usual. When Bitcoin was rising Alts were steady too. suddenly when BCH started rising Alts were tanking too.

What happened in India?
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:13:41
What are you talking about you can verify it in way back machine archives
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:38:26
Lol litecoin is the Faster one.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:49:01
Indian reserved bank also released statement regarding bitcoin too.that might be also the cause of the dip.
 
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:38:12
Thank you will look into it.
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:25:56
Don't forget US government is actively looking into the whole cryptocurrency thing right now. Dont expect them to remain silent when dollar starts leaking. Bad things for crypto in future if this market manipulation ruffles some features the wrong ways.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:24:05
Wow seriously? They are saying nonstop that we don't sensor opposing views.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:10:16
There is no corresponding google search spike for alt Bitcoin . 8mb block alt Bitcoin price is rising despite public interest. On the other hand Bitcoin prices always followed google search trends about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:31:37
Scaling. Gaven wanted to increase block size too.
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:39:51
Gold will always have functionality. Comparation to gold is stupid.itw a fucking element. Bitcoin is in its own league.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:15:42
Are you kidding I am started to get scared. What if this goes below 5000. Bitcoin cash is up 60 percent today. High fees is also turning new users off.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:12:50
It's fucking 14k USD in Indian exchanges. I cashed out my one third of portfolio.i will invest base amount again once price equalises near international markets.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:26:26
What are you even talking about. He is just discussing. stop trying to devide community
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:54:59
What's wrong with background checks? Roger Ver has questionable background too.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:44:43
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:48:27
Nope . checkout btc price now.its crashing. Correction was predicted.so it will settle down I guess around 7000 usd or max 6500
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:38:37
Last pump before hashrate change is occurring right now.
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:49:19


stopped reading. Doesn't even explain the problem properly. Bcash advert.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:07:58
This is legit. And very concerning.
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:18:12
So how does it work? If I have 1 btc now after fork I get 2 coins? 1 btc and 1 s2x ? Where do I get this? At exchanges? What if my country's exchanges don't give second coin?  Should I get two different coins even if I redeem them like 1 year after the fork? I am so confused. Can anyone link relevant articles?
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:11:28
Thanks did just that yesterday.
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:33:01
Total world economy 107 trillion USD.
Total Bitcoins after full mining: 21 million
Bitcoin price if completely replace all economy = 107 trillion / 21 million 
= **5,095,238 USD**
Figures copy pasted from first google result. You folks are free to shred it to pieces.
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:19:08
So this is the major announcement they were preaching about the other day?
@_date: 2017-11-01 09:16:37
494000  now. it's insane
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:18:17
It's now in billions.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:35:01
I don't know what is true and wrong any more
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:37:15
Unlike you I am redditor for 2 years. I am new to crypto and there are some pretty good allegations against core on r/btc . I recently invested in Bitcoin and just worried about this fork and  trying to get sense of the situation.

Because it takes away power from them. Cryptocurrencies are not just currencies they are secure decentralised protocols. And you can build tons of application on it. Decentalised databases and ownership on blockchain will compete against traditional financial institutions and companies.
@_date: 2018-02-18 04:15:56
You should look into lightning network and tangle.
@_date: 2018-02-18 04:51:32
Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency. And use cases don't limit to transactions only. Cryptocurrencies are decentalised cryptographically secured protocols. And that's where it gains it's value. You can build apps on top of it. Like etherum and neo, you can store data on blockchains and monetize that data buy tieing up ownership. Solutions regarding volatility are in development. New crypto projects are trying to tie all cryptocurrencies. Request Network is trying to build a system where merchant can request payment in multiple different currencies. But you can pay with any currencies. It will get converted on on the network as per market rate. Both will receive invoice of transactions. You can create temper proof voting process on blockchain. United nations is partnered with HST Decision token for voting on blockchain. You can tie genetic data of participants of research on blockchain and they will receive lifetime of payment whenever someone uses their data. You can build temper proof smart electricity grids .

Adoption. Nothing else is needed. It's currently valued against USD.if enough adoption happen it will get it's inherent value from use.
@_date: 2018-02-18 05:16:28
At currently speculation. If one need to invest in different crypto one need to look into all partnerships, development team , road map etc. Stellar have IBM partnership, iota has Bosch , etc. Major companies are building blockchains for their businesses so people are running behind those partnership currently. Half of this is speculation honestly.its is like dotcom bubble. Most start-ups will die.but some will become next google or Amazon
@_date: 2018-02-18 22:13:12
This brings IOT devices closer to bitcoin.this is huge
@_date: 2018-02-18 04:40:10
Exchanges take more fees. As operating cost. Wallet to wallet is whole different thing.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:37:45
I took a 1 dollar profit on my investment I made 4 days ago. Now waiting for dip
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:31:09
I made my first dollar in this rise. I bought few bits for hodl. And few bits to sell high buy cheap just to test volatility. I made my first dollar today. woohooo.
@_date: 2018-02-18 04:33:05
You should read more about decentalised exchanges man. They are still work in progress but in one or two year they will be reality. Also read smart contracts and atomic swaps. We know exchanges are unsecure and that's why many startups are creating decentalised exchanges.

In 2011 I tried mining Bitcoin but left efforts after a day or two. I considered buying some but I was struggling with money and lack of any guidelines in my country at that time made me wait few more years. When Bitcoin was 200 USD this March I thought I will now buy it but lacked few documents for KYC process for a certified buyer in my country. then when it reached 600 USD month later I tried to convince few friends to buy Bitcoins for themselves and buy some for me too. They said it's too high and bubble will burst. My application for a tax accountant number was still underway. Now everything is ready and I could buy some Bitcoin and I bought few bits at 5700 USD price. I regret for not buying early.
@_date: 2018-02-18 04:53:42
Difficulty to mine increases exponentially if someone jumps into network with huge machines. Bitcoin hashrate to mine changes every 16 days.
@_date: 2017-10-30 05:25:16
Yeah that's why I started with few bits. I wanted to know how tax and other fees get deducted. I wanted to invest in crypto since 2011 but was in debt when I was student.now I can afford little investment. And I am learning new things on this sub everyday. Plus earning from home is like a lifedream for me. I wants to be content creator but this is just as much nice.
@_date: 2018-02-18 04:21:43
Yeah but unlike banks I don't store my Bitcoins on exchanges. Only when I want to exchange them into other currencies I go to exchanges. exchanges are more like malls than banks
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:49:33
that's starting salary. engineers with experience earn way more. plus cost of living is dirt cheap in India. at 40k per month I save around 20k per month even though I live as single.
