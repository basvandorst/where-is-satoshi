n0mdep,  you are trying to have a logical conversation with an illogical person.

Sorry, I didn't mean to sound crude, I'm just trying to understand more.  There has to be an clearer way of explaining it.  I'm trying to understand both sides.  Could you, or someone else help me understand it?  ( FYI, I know coding/networking/db development with 10+ years of experience)

I know you are just trolling me, but I'm not taking the bait.
Serious question: Why not both plans?  Upgrade to 2 MB right now and then use segwit/LN when it's finished?

Can a LN expert help clear things up for me?
Pretend I am an average user who just got into bitcoin.
I want to pay for something in btc.  
Will it be as simple as the following steps?
1. select receiving address to send to
2. type in the amount.
3. press send
4. enter password, and done

Me and everyone else on board who pays attention will continue to support a capacity upgrade.  
@_date: 2016-04-01 13:25:23
Ok, so 7-8 bytes per signature?  That's all?
From 71-72 bytes down to 64 bytes?
If that's all that it's capable of, I don't see how your point is valid.  We need increase in capacity RIGHT NOW, and segwit will only provide 1.6MB and signatures can only be compressed by 7-8 bytes.  SegWit is not going to help much. 
@_date: 2016-04-19 21:12:28
It would be really nice if this happened.
Upgrade the max blocksize limit, develop SegWit, LN and thin blocks.

I for one, will only be running Bitcoin Core. I hope they implement the 8MB blocksize in Core, not just XT.
I support the increase to 8MB with growth each year, but I think that straying away from Bitcoin Core could cause confusion and uncertainty. 
I'm thinking long term worst case scenario, the 8MB blocksize is only implemented in XT, they become a super majority (&gt;75%). Then those who are running Core are left behind.
At that point we will be at the mercy of whatever the XT developers want to implement since XT will have the super majority.
Hopefully everything I just said is wrong and won't happen.

@_date: 2014-04-09 00:31:55
Based on my knowledge and history of bitcoin, I would say it really should not drop any lower then 300-400$ before recovering.
There are just too many buy orders that will pull the price back up if it dips too low. I know for a fact that if bitcoin ever dropped lower than that, the price would be too tempting to resist for me.
I think short sellers / crypto traders are part of this price resilience. (which could actually be a good thing for once.)
I am NOT an expert though, and I could be wrong.

I've never understood why people prefer cold storage in the form of a paper wallet. If someone ever finds your hiding spot and understands what it is, then you are screwed. At least if it's in an encrypted wallet, they still have to have the password.
Personally, I transfer all coins to the regular bitcoin-qt wallet, with an extremely long password ( a favorite phrase or sentence with numbers and special characters).
Keep that wallet on a true crypt volume with a different very long password, and I have a copy on 3 different thumbdrives. 
One thumbdrive hidden in my house, one at my dads house, and another sealed in a small weather proof container buried in a complete random location(along with a burnt copy of the volume on a CD-R, just in case moisture ruins the thumbdrive).
@_date: 2014-05-28 01:55:45
I now understand your points.
I believe that what you are asking for is just a pipe dream that is almost impossible and will go nowhere. I am certain that the more you understand IT security, programming, networking, and how the source code of the blockchain functions, you will realize that what you are asking for will never ever happen, nor would anybody who understands the technology would ever want it to happen. Even if you try to force it by law, there are a million ways around it. 
I'm very sorry to burst your bubble, but I believe you might be wasting your time.
I give you an A for effort, as your points were kind of interesting. 
I enjoyed having this discussion with you.
@_date: 2014-01-23 09:48:33
I wonder which of the two supposedly anonymous coins will be successful, AnonymousCoin or ZeroCoin.
@_date: 2014-03-06 09:41:19
It's supposed to be difficult by design, it adds to the security of the network.
The computing power and electricity that go into keeping Bitcoin secure adds to it's value.
Example : A bank has huge costs that go into armed guards, armored vehicles, security cameras,
                insurance costs, ect.
                The Bitcoin network is kept secure without the same costs as a bank.
@_date: 2014-04-09 01:05:08
Ok, that's a start. More questions
1. Is the email you are using google mail? ( if so, check the very bottom of the page for your gmail account, there is a link that shows recent login activity and the IP addresses associated with them) Anything look out of the ordinary?
2. Any password reset e-mails? ect any kind of clues you can provide?
I cannot find out how you got your coins stolen. I can only provide information on what I do to keep my coins safe.
I will explain my techniques in layers.
1. I always keep a majority of my coins on the regular bitcoin-qt wallet, unless I need to spend a small amount on my phones bitcoin app.
2. Make sure the wallet.dat password is ridiculously long. It's best to use a favorite phrase or sentence with numbers and special characters in between each word.
3. The (BIG) bitcoin wallet.dat file is contained inside a TrueCrypt encrypted container.
4. The truecrypt container is inside of a Ubuntu VMware image. ( with a different password
5. The Ubuntu root password is different and complex
6. The Ubuntu VMware image files themselves are inside of another truecrypt container ( with a different complex password).
7. The truecrypt container with VMware files are kept on 3 separate offline storage devices. 
(for added security, when typing in the password for the wallet.dat, use an onscreen keyboard to resist keyloggers).

What... What?
gnaritas, it is a three hop allegation.
Basically if this is the standard, then more then half the people here that bought bitcoin can be charged with conspiracy to launder based on where that coin was last.
Also, by that definition, if you have USD in your wallet, there is a good chance that at least one of the bills was involved in something illegal, which makes you involved if they want to interpret it the same way.

I had never thought of your cold/hot wallet combo idea before. It might be an interesting concept. I do know that the bitcoin-qt wallet stores 100 pre-generated addresses automatically just incase you make a new receiving address and don't make another backup of the wallet.

2. A cryptocurrency that can be used regardless of borders or boundaries is exactly what could and is being used by people around the globe.

No problem. Security is only good as it's weakest link.
In this case, your weak link was your e-mail.
Well, depending on how much money you have lost and how worth it it is to you to try to find them, I'm not sure.
I did find these though, the last activity that was recorded from 98.181.9.141 was march 22nd. What day was the login? When was the last day you checked your wallet?  (Keep in mind, the links below might not be the actual person, could be a proxy or dynamic IP)

KingOfRye,  thank you for well thought out question, and I appreciate having a serious discussion on the subject.
Allow me to contribute. 
Technology has always been used for good and bad. Technology will always evolve, and it is unstoppable. While the internet itself is used by a small percentage of individuals for unethical purposes, it does not mean that we need to have "packet validation" (coin validation). The amount of good that comes from the internet far outweighs the bad.
It would disrupt too many legitimate services and I'm not even sure it's possible to successfully implement.
The idea of "Coin validation" is not feasible unless the following questions can be answered.
1. What if a user receives cryptocoins for legitimate services/goods, while those coins were previously used for something illegal? Does the legitimate user then lose the money?
2. How would you determine what is illegal if it is used around the world? Different countries have different laws, and coin validation will only force people to use a service in a different country.
3. by your definition, does that mean that any physical dollar that was used in an illegal transaction becomes invalid? (80% of physical US dollars have a certain trace amount of cocaine on them, does that make all those dollars invalid?)

Maybe it should be some sort of combination of (connections + bandwidth) / total uptime.
Otherwise someone could just save a list of IPs, and add a bunch of the IPs to the conf file to make it appear that his node has been on a long time, while in reality, only turning the node on once and a while instead of all the time.
@_date: 2014-05-13 03:32:00
Yes, I would say 0.05 BTC a month per node would be great.
Then again, what would be the measurement?
Uptime? Bandwidth? Or maybe some kind of measurement of how many times your node got used?

This is simply a payment network that cannot be controlled/corrupted by any one person, because source code cannot be bribed like a politician can. It's a bit far-fetched to lump those two together in the same group.
This technology needed to be this way if it were ever to survive, because any competition to central banks and federal reserve system is squashed with absolute brutal force. This technology would not be invented if there was not a desperate need for it.

My personal opinion is that I'm not against LN, I believe LN will have many use cases, and certain users/merchants will use it where applicable.  However, you still need to open/close LN channels on-chain, which means you still need more on-chain capacity.
Also, I don't think that it's good to FORCE all future users to use LN.  I think the future will be a combination of both on-chain and off-chain transactions.  We need both.

Yes, also to add to that, even for miners that are behind the great firewall of china where latency and/or bandwidth is an issue, solutions like xthin blocks have been developed specifically to help them with larger blocks and reducing orphan rates.  This was the main argument against larger blocks for a long time.
There are no longer any excuses to not upgrade block capacity.

You are half right and half wrong.  Fees are required to fund the miners as the reward halvings occur.  So the idea would be to enable miners to put more than just 1MB worth of transactions every 10 minutes on average.  
The larger the blocksize limit, the more transactions that can be processed, thus resulting in larger quantity of transaction fee revenue.

Bitcoin increasing the blocksize limit and the whole ethereum DAO smart contract situation are two completely different things.

I'm not sure your argument of the state attacking nodes holds much water.  BitTorrent uses much more bandwidth and has been around for a decade, and is a direct enemy of the state.

Since Gavin recently said he would release the individual feature patches of BIP101 for Core, I think I will just choose to install the 8MB BIP101 patch, without the extra things that come with 101.
This will allow those with nodes to choose which features they want to install.
After weighing all the options for a few months, my current decision is to run Core nodes with only the 8MB patch from 101.  I'm still always open to new solutions when they finally post the code and I will inspect them.
But until then, I wholeheartedly think that Core with BIP101 is the most reasonable and stable solution.

Yeah, I'm still confused by that as well.  Nobody is sure what metric to go by in terms of measuring centralization/decentralization.   
I'll offer my opinion with an example.   Some have been saying that running a node on a VPS is a step towards centralization.  I would say, it might be, but as long as you don't host all your nodes on the same VPS provider, that takes a step towards decentralization. So not much changes in that scenario.
@_date: 2016-05-31 19:14:49
Said by brg444  
- The data observes and measure latency and bandwidth between nodes and not miners/pools and therefore is not relevant to the issue that concerns us.
I don't understand your logic at all.  All miners/pools point their hashing power towards a full node.  Therefore, this study of latency and bandwidth between nodes is valid.

In order to answer your question, I have a few myself first.
When you say "passed peer review", do you mean everybody who studied it, got the same conclusion?  Or just the core developers?

Let's stop this whole "US vs them" mentality and stop the blanket judgements, it's reddit after all.
@_date: 2016-05-23 20:20:12
Ok, you raise a fair point.   The study says 90% of the nodes could handle 2-4MB blocks, but the study does not measure how much decentralization would occur with that change.
So now the two questions to hammer down are the following
 -  1. How much will 2-4 MB blocks centralize the network?
 -  2. Once the blocks become 2-4 MB, what's to stop those blocks becoming full immediately?
For issue  I would spectate that most of the nodes that will get potentially left behind are some nodes belonging to Chinese mining pools due to the poor quality of internet connection, and give other countries with better ISPs an advantage.  However, since China miners have a cheap energy advantage over others, wouldn't this balance things out a bit?
For issue  What's to stop someone from filling 1MB blocks right now?  At least it would be more expensive to fill the block and would help the transaction backlog.  Any thoughts on this?
@_date: 2016-05-23 17:57:58
Scaling Bitcoin on-chain to allow more users to come in before the halving.  That's it, that's the agenda. 
Detailed network and performance analysis completed almost a year ago proved that the network could handle 2-4 MB blocks right now.
@_date: 2016-07-09 16:27:30
 - Potentially "more transactions" also equals "less revenue" if people start paying too little for a transaction
Well that is ultimately up to each miner to decide what the min fee for a transaction is. They have the choice to not accept any transactions below a certain fee level.  Some miners might process cheaper transactions, but that's up to them.
 - They've gone up to around ten cents before, at the end of 2013
That is true, it's had spikes before, but for the majority of the time, it was usually around 1-5 cents.

Where do you get your info from?
@_date: 2016-05-24 03:38:38
1. In a perfect scenario, we would find a way to make sure China can stay and keep mining with bigger blocks. Possibly because of optimizations like extreme thin blocks, or header first mining. 
2. I agree, that's true in your analogy, however I'm not talking about free transactions, just cheap transactions.  Eventually as the coinbase reward gets much lower, quantity of transactions all have to add up to make up for lost profit from the halving.  If miners can't turn a profit anymore, they will stop mining, and the security will decrease due to the drop in hash power.  Naturally the value of bitcoin will go up, but I don't think it can go up 10 fold every halving forever.

We shall see what happens after July when core doesn't deliver the blocksize increase via HF that the miners have asked for. The miners have said they have until Aug 1st.
It's likely that the miners will won't wait any longer, eventually they run an implementation that has the blocksize increase.

Thank you for your thoughts.
I agree,  I would think that the code should be written so if a certain percentage of miners (maybe 75% or 90% ect)  show support for a higher blocksize limit, then the HF could be triggered by that. Plus a few weeks grace time after it's been triggered to give time for the remaining percentage to upgrade.

If it takes a few hours to get one confirmation before being able to download the game, that is unacceptable.
Can you all please raise the blocksize limit to something more proper?

Normally I don't care if the transaction I am making is delayed getting a confirmation for a few hours, unless it's time sensitive.
Example, If I am buying a game on steam and have to wait an hour (or a few hours depending on how many other people are transacting) then it gets frustrating that I can't immediately start downloading the game until it gets confirmed.
(disclaimer: Steam doesn't give me the option to pay a higher fee)
@_date: 2016-07-22 15:59:55
That is correct, it was to fix a bug.
My point is that we can hard fork to raise the blocksize limit to something more appropriate. Don't let anybody tell you that a HF has never been done to Bitcoin before.

- As I mentioned, that's not strictly true. You can't charge nothing and make it up in volume
In theory, more block space = more transactions = more transaction fees for miners. 
- What price have they always been?
They have usually hovered around 1-5 cents per transaction if I recall correctly.
@_date: 2016-07-08 13:25:50
Miners need to be paid, I understand and agree with that.
There are going to be millions of more bitcoin users soon, each of them need to make transactions.  If we had a higher block size limit, miners could make more bitcoin in transaction fees via higher quantity as the coinbase reward goes down overtime.  I really don't think there will ever be free transactions, but I believe in keeping transaction fees about the same price they have always been.
Quantity of transaction fees is the key.
@_date: 2016-07-13 19:24:23
That's a good point.
I wonder if they need to do some extra coding to automatically lock a person out if someone tries to pull some fuckery, or if their system already has it in place.

@_date: 2016-07-16 18:47:45
I'm pretty sure you could have multiple outputs for one transaction, which would make more sense than creating 250 separate transactions.
I think the limit is 100,000 bytes worth of data per transaction.

- Ok but they are incentivized to take in all they can afford to, setting their own fee level is just losing them revenue to someone else who under bids them
Right, I think we are both trying to say the same thing, but saying it differently. I think we both agree that miners need more money over time as block reward keeps halving.  There are only two ways to make that happen without a price increase alone.
- Scenario A, (with more block space) - more users  = more transactions = more transaction fees  = miners can make profit from quantity of fees.
- Scenario B, (with the same block space) - more users = more transactions = longer confirmation time = increased fees = miners make a profit from fees increasing.
The question we need to ask ourselves is, which scenario will have the best outcome? 
@_date: 2016-07-31 19:21:35
