Thanks but it doesn't apply. After I logged in I transferred all btc in my old Blockchain.info wallet address to my new Blockchain.info wallet balance as recommended by Blockchain.info

It says "Coinbase will discontinue SMS support for **accessing** Coinbase accounts"
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:16:53


So no email announcement sent to customers who use SMS 2FA? What happens to customers who don't have a smartphone?!

They don't, they use Bitstamp price in the wallet.
@_date: 2017-03-11 21:14:06
They do update it in the wallet but didn't earlier. Logging out and back in didn't update it either.
@_date: 2017-03-24 01:02:13
Again this has nothing to do with it.

You don't have support either at Coinbase! Look at the hundreds of complaints in your sub alone, not to mention the hundreds in this sub and others! Why don't you address how poor your support is? You have one of the highest buy prices and fees, why don't you spend some of your profit on support?
@_date: 2017-03-11 21:15:08
Price was stuck in the wallet!

This has nothing to do with it. Other exchanges have no problem broadcasting the transaction in a few minutes after you send bitcoin from your exchange account.
@_date: 2017-03-24 00:46:28
I don't mind paying the transaction fee for a standard transaction but they are charging for transactions that have more than 1 input.
I withdraw from Coinbase to my wallet immediately, the issue is Coinbase doesn't send the bitcoin for hours now.
I brought all this up in my post.

Blockchain.info wallet is again lagging on received bitcoin like last [time]( this is the **fourth** time for me now! Why does this keep happening with **only** your wallet and explorer?

35 mins ago. This has been reported before on here by others too.
