sigh, you work for an ISP, and can't tell the difference between a DOS attack and just having a large amount of people visit your site.
Where is the information about you accepting bitcoin on the website? where do i even sign up?

What do you want them for? if you think there a commodity then yes, its probably a little too late.
If you want it as a currency then the price is irrelevant.

oh dear -_-
Go and learn what an exchange actually does.

IF they ship.
The waiting list for ASIC miners is so long by the time you get it the difficulty will have raised and you may never see a return.
@_date: 2013-04-23 09:27:19
Is it even relevant to bitcoin?

Well it can, if you went on a chat site and the java popup came on asking if you wanted to run it and it did, then it would run regardless.
Silent Java Drive by's need an exploit in Java.
Bitcoin-qt is innocent in all this!
@_date: 2013-04-19 05:36:25
It isn't an exploit...
You click an unknown link, which looks pretty suspect anyway, it had a java drive by which infected your PC.
Your password clearly wasn't that strong, because you must have used it on a different site.
You've learnt a harsh lesson, Disable Java(not java script) in your browser there is no need for it.

Does this mean, that in the UK could I set up a business that only accepted bitcoins, but sell items at 20% less than what competitiors charging as VAT should have already been paid on the coins?
As single use vouchers what tax implications are there for accepting and cashing out bitcoins? 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:51:36
What would the big buy achieve though, slightly inflating the price?

@_date: 2013-04-13 00:57:36
seems fine to me? :S

You answered your own question.

you won't get that much for not doing a lot, if you have nothing to sell you just aren't going to make that much money, just like how you don't get paid that much per advert click in USD, it isn't going to be any different in Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:07:27
why, they make money on every sale.
Remember they aren't a bank, when people sell, it means someone else bought, MT Gox only provided the tools to make that transaction happen and they get the Fee to cover that.

it isn't going to drop to 0, it will most likely fall to about $60, its where most of the other exchanges are holding right now (IMO).
The big buy would be negated by the people who have no confidence in Bitcoin and sell anyway which will lower the price.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:02:57
you can tell by the fact that every other exchange is at $60 (give or take)
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:04:21
A floor that they would have to keep putting in because people would just keep selling.
as much as Mt Gox has sucked over the last few days, at least they have money to keep going forwards, let them spend the money on improving the hardware/software, which will in turn benefit the market.
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:18:58
where does it ever say it's an instant transfer?
