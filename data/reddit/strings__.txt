Attacking a spelling error now invalidates the whole point? Not sure what school you went to. But that's not how discourse works.

That's a good point, however by the time bitcoins can not be mined anymore Bitcoin will be established, the projected date for final minting is 2140. That's 122 years from now.
And besides currently as we speak your betamax analogy is inaccurate. Concidering Bitcoin is more metaphorically VHS.
Just a thought 
@_date: 2018-03-27 22:37:21
Yes it does, since it takes real assets to produce Bitcoins. Which goto miners and they have vested interest to keep its value and they do that by holding coins.

I was just stating facts. I'm not even a huge Bitcoin fan haha
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:53:58
I think your assuming I was making an argument for Bitcoin. I was simply stating facts.
In hind sight it seems you meant coins as in cryptocurrencies? If so I'd still argue that Bitcoin though it's v1 technology is still leading in its field currently.
Also I can argue that though http is not v1 it's still leading in it technology field though somewhat revised. And I can take that a step farther and argue TCP IP though revised has not changed and holds a steadfast monopoly.
So there are presidencies especially when it comes to network protocols.

Yes it is speculative, but I'd argue that Bitcoin is less speculative then some unknown future dominate coin. That's even more spectaculative since Bitcoin is the current dominant coin, by a large margin.
There is nothing wrong with speculative investing, you just investing accordingly.
And again comparing physical technology to software protocols, is like apples to oranges. As I pointed out HTTP, TCP IP are two examples of v1 layered protocols that are still currently dominant. As per your request, and you have not countered that argument.
Nor does it make sense to equate Bitcoin position as betamax, when it's currently VHS

There is a finite amount of bitcoins 21 million to be precise. At the time of this post 16.9 million are in circulation.
Contrary to popular belief, Bitcoin does have real world backing in the form of electricity and hardware. This leads miners into holding. Which makes coins scarce which drives coin prices up. 
Now imagine what happens when coins can't be produced anymore. Oh add the fact that producing Bitcoins between now and then gets extremely harder and harder to do.
@_date: 2018-03-28 14:43:25
Huh? Bitcoin is built on the blockchain. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 14:06:13
What the fuck is wrong with you? Ive already established its a protocol. Read the thread first before chirping in

Dollars value is set by banks, which is subject to inflation.
Bitcoin is not subject to inflation hence why so many people in venezuela are buying it.
The value of Bitcoin is set mostly by miners, who know the cost to mine them. Current it's around 1000$ usd to mine one Bitcoin.

True, there is the possibility to sell and cut losses. However it's not something alot of miners do, since they are invest. It's easier to stop mining and wait for demand . Miners general hold.  
I won't discount the potential for zero demand. But as volatile as Bitcoin appears, demand has not zeroed out yet. Until then who knows

Cherry picking one spelling error and discounting the whole post. Comes across as looking for some excuse to discredit the poster.

I thought you were making an Ad Homien argument. So ya I guess that was an assumption. As apposed to some rude person, insulting someone over a honest spelling mistake.
@_date: 2018-03-28 06:09:18
That assumes that TCP IP has never had competitors. And besides I was asked to give an example of early technology that is still the defacto standard. Which was the OP's original argument, which means you have taken this out of context.
@_date: 2018-03-28 00:08:34
How so?
@_date: 2018-03-28 15:42:55
I can argue the same point about Bitcoin. There is no reason to change it since it's a well adopted application with  underlying protocols. Once you change the application or protocols it's no longer Bitcoin.
I could even split hairs for you. And argue Bitcoins peer-to-peer network is vague. Ive rarely found a DHT network that was not modified, I'd suspect bitcoins DHT peer-to-peer network is not exactly like bittorrents.
None of it matters or is it important. Since I was giving an example of technology still dominant from inception. Nothing more
@_date: 2018-03-27 23:32:19
There is demand you said so yourself Bitcoin is speculative so you have speclative investors. That is a demand
People buy Bitcoin to avoid inflation see Venezuela. Again demand 
And supply is dictated by miners, why would you sell for less then it costs to mine a coin?
Im sure there is some future reality where people don't want bitcoins. But that in its self is speculative.
So all we can get from this is Bitcoin is speculative, ergo invest accordingly

An idiot is someone that makes Ad Homien  arguments
@_date: 2018-03-28 15:01:15
No but the "application" is not functional without HTTP and TCP IP. Likewise with Bitcoin you need the blockchain and a DHT peer-to-peer network to call it Bitcoin. You can change the underlying protocols to suit your fancy, but in the case of Bitcoin odds are your not going to be calling it Bitcoin anyone.
Also your confusing an example as a comparison. If you read thread the request was for v1 technology that was still dominant after inception. So my example doesnt even have to be comparable, though in this case they are  somewhat comparable.

It's more stable then the bolívar. Based on your criteria Bitcoin is more of a currency then bolívar. And all the Venezuelan people buying Bitcoin agree with you.
