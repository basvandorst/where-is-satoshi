Oh no not at all, I was mostly speaking about bitcoin, I do believe that another crypto will take over and follow its path, (maybe end in the same way and the next one will take over)

No but after a crash of this magnitude you've got a realise its over, when the titanic hit an iceberg and was ripped in half, were people yelling "hold onto your tickets fellas, its gonna come back I promise, buy more tickets"

I meant the movie, or do you mean that you dont believe the titanic sank?

Why are you all so delusional? I'm sorry as much as this sucks for me too but its over. As soon as everyone and their mother knows about the 50% crash since the 20k mark no average joe will invest innit

Thats good, you seem to know what youre doing its just sad when people put a bunch of money (sometimes their life savings) into something they know little about and then have it crumbling down.

It's one thing when it drops at early stages with a loss of 28 dollars in value, but losing 10 grand in under a month, thats what scares people. There may be potential for it to come back, yes. But the chance of that is quite slim. May I ask when and how much you have invested?
