Couldn't disagree more. Inflows from financial institutions that increase the market cap of the coin are exactly what bitcoin needs to make it a superior currency- more liquidity.  The fact that institutional money can get involved will legitimise and embed bitcoin more into society , rather than being seen as the plaything of fringe libertarians and drug dealers. That will make it much less likely for super harsh non sensical regulations down the line as the world of finance will have a vested interest in bitcoin's success. Any ETF should be celebrated as important step on the road towards btc making a meaningful contribution to society.  That said, I have a hard time seeing it happen this time around.

People should remember that these contracts don't equate to probabilities since the outcome will be a large determinant of the value of the underlying.   i.e.  imagine a No on the ETF meant no change in btc price, but a yes means a jump to $2500.     Then  if the probability of a yes was say 40% buying the futures contract would imply a 60% chance of losing say $400 (0.4btc) but a 40% chance of gaining 0.6 btc = $1500.  This toy example would have the probability implied by the futures price around 28%

You would say buy 1 share of the ETF and it would represent 0.1 btc which the winklevii would hold on your behalf by going out and buying it at a bitcoin exchange.  It would allow people to gain exposure to btc via traditional finance mechanisms rather than having to learn the necessary tech to DIY.  Like buying a copper ETF rather than storing a lump of it yourself.  More importantly,  it would allow financial institutions who currently could not invest in btc (for regulatory reasons) to gain exposure to it.  That is potentially an enormous source of money and hence the ETF is a necessary but not sufficient condition if btc is to become a "digital gold" safe haven asset.  The ETF being approved would be a big positive for the price. It would likely result in a lot of speculation,  but aside from that it would be the first plank bridging the world of crypto into more traditional finance, even if only in terms of legitimising it as a non-scam to finance heads.

Regarding the idea that - "If the stock market crashes money surely will go in to crypto..."   
Put yourself in the shoes of a typical middle aged middle class bitcoin owner who bought in the last 6 months for the first time.  The kind of person like a dentist or lawyer who has a net worth of a few million, reads the Economist and whose nephew that fixes his printer/PC told him about bitcoin. Let's call him Andy.  Andy thinks 'what the hell' and buys $100k of crypto in late '17.  It is to my mind, these people, not super libertarian anti central bank / the world is going to burn goldbug types that have pushed the price from say 1000 to where it is now.   All the paranoid types already had their money in.  If there is a stock market crash (or say with a recession,that costs him his job) that lops 30% off this guy's net worth,  what makes you think he will buy more crypto?   To mind he will have a lot less appetite for risk and the first thing he will sell is his bitcoin stash,  since  it's super volatile/risky and it will represent a much bigger % of his net worth if the stock market has crashed and crypto stays still.

He had regular posts between the football ones, so I guess he just likes it?  Did he have any other public social media profiles?
