When I first joined the Bitcoin community in early 2013, Roger Ver was referred to as *'Bitcoin Jesus'*.
After learning a lot about the ecosystem during this time and a lot of the actors, I now like to refer to him as the **'Bitcoin Judas'**

The former has released less than 1% of the documents handed over by Snowden. Making him and the few journalists who got this important information the arbiters for what is best for the wider audience to know.
The latter on the other hand releases pristine copies of the data in a searchable/indexed manner allowing everyone equal access to the same information allowing for wider dissemination of information and a more informed citizenry as a consequence of that.
And might I add the latter does so with extreme dangers to their own person and having to live under the threat of persecution from the corrupt people he exposes.

These are not 'New Snowden documents'. TheIntercept (Glenn Greenwald and co.) have had these documents for the past 3+ years. 
And they're only releasing them now because someone else has done so. It would have been much better to have released these documents to Wikileaks in the interest of Journalism and transparency.

I've up-voted this, but like many others in this thread find the choice of location not very appealing.

Just saw this being [tweeted by Wikileaks]( 
Apparently this is malware created by a company associated with NSA which affects CISCO/Juniper and other networking hardware.
Some hackers got into the systems of ['The equation group']( a cyber attack group responsible for creating these malwares. 
They've provided a lot of files for free, but apparently the best ones they are still holding on to and asking for Bitcoin at [this]( address. 
The highest bidder on this address will get the decryption key to the files.

I doubt we will have to ever create a change in the protocol that will create the situation of 'move them or lose them'. And I'm fairly certain that we could change the hashing algorithms and allow the code to check which algorithm is used in a particular UTXO.
@_date: 2015-12-06 07:37:55
It's actually a pretty good conference. People representing  90% of Bitcoin hash power are on the stage right now and they're all talking a lot of sense. 
My perception is that they want the growth curve of BIP100 and the voting thresholds of BIP101. 
Anyone want to create another BIP combining that. It would be very popular with the miners!
@_date: 2015-06-12 14:36:46
It's not exactly 'totally' irrelevant to this conversation IMO. Wider adoption gives Bitcoin more public visibility which makes it a tad bit harder for the regulators to run amok with whatever they want from this technology. One of Gavin's stated desires is more adoption for this very reason.
@_date: 2015-06-12 15:25:00
I agree with you. My intention was not to sway the opinions of others one way or another, but to point out that such simulations actually do exist. And they are almost never mentioned. Heck, I didn't know about this until a few days ago. And this is a 7 month old study.
And I also agree that solutions like IBLT to mitigate the large block propagation should be vetted first before introducing such large blocks. 
@_date: 2015-12-10 03:36:09
There are [quantum resistant cryptographic algorithms]( already in place. 
In the academic circles, this probability has been known for a while and they've been working on it for years. All we will have to do is change the cryptographic algorithms in Bitcoin and we'll be fine. 
Ethereum [is already designing]( for this from the ground up.
@_date: 2015-06-12 14:15:30
I'm glad that someone has taken the initiative to at-least create a BIP for this.
I am neutral in this debate of the block size increase and have found myself swayed by arguments from both sides.


Simulations are practically non­existent.
The amount of financial engineering done by the side that wants bigger block sizes has definitely been more than the side that does not want the block size increase.
As far as simulations, [the  folks did something akin to this back in October of 2014 and I am really surprised that not more people are referencing this excellent study.](
I strongly encourage the folks who are against raising the block size to review this simulation.
Here are its TL-DR; conclusions:


@_date: 2015-06-16 12:28:12
They are accepting it. Just like they accept Visa and Mastercard. This increases the velocity of the bitcoin tokens that powers the Bitcoin network. It's still pretty good. Even if they convert it to USD. 
Over time I am sure many of these outlets that are accepting Bitcoin today will find more vertical integrations to pay their suppliers and will start holding onto more and more of their Bitcoins. That part will probably go mainstream when we start seeing contracts on the Block chain.

Well, then perhaps they should call it the 'Most Popular Companies' instead of 'Most Innovative Startups'. 
And, conformal is the creator of btcd. An alternative bitcoin implementation written in golang. They're doing a lot of cool stuff and were one of the first group of people to come up with some actual simulations of what will happen to the bitcoin network with an increase in block size.
@_date: 2015-06-12 14:24:11




You are contradicting yourself there in two consecutive sentences. Even though no dev wants to increase the soft limit, you definitely are wanting to do so (and albeit in a more convoluted way), where the miners are even less inclined to touch the code or change the limit for themselves because they don't want to deal with all the logic you have introduced in there for them.
@_date: 2015-06-18 16:10:07
There is a BIP 100 authored by jgarzik which I believe most core-devs are contributing to in some way shape or form. Gavin has also said that he is OK with a proposal along those lines, so all this talk about what Mike wants and desires is stirring old crap. 
Give this proposal some time. It resolves most of the issues related to scaling the block size in a very balanced way.

Over 32 MB, the protocol would need to have a hard fork anyways. For a host of other reasons not even related to the block size. 
I think that the max size of a message in the bitcoin protocol is 32MB so a new block message will have to adhere to that rule anyways.

I also know that from other discussions elsewhere that Adam Back supports this idea. (In fact, this proposal is based on some of the ideas he originally proposed).
Additionally, I feel that this addresses most of the concerns if not all that have been brought up by Matt Coralo, Pieter and Wladimir.
Mike Hearn has remained silent about it, and Peter Todd is objecting to it as he feels it gives miners way too much power. But I take everything from the last two with a slight grain of salt.

I absolute love this idea, however the way Gyft has implemented it, it's less likely to take off.
The most important thing is that the transferability of these tokens is severely limited. If I buy a gift card, I have to spend (redeem) it at the merchant, I can't transfer it to someone else who could then redeem it.
["transfer among users after initial purchase is made **impossible**"](

I have a couple of questions.

Wow, I posted the original link 2 days ago... and today, I read this:
@_date: 2014-10-18 14:18:00
Cool. I wanted to mention two more points:
1. Try doing some back of the envelope numbers: Say you get 1000 merchants in and around you (which really shouldn't be that difficult), each giving you roughly Rs. 1000 worth of Ads (in their own coupons of course) on a recurring monthly basis.
That is Rs. 1000000 !!! (MONTHLY) worth of value on the network (JUST IN YOUR LOCAL AREA) - Now exponentiate that neighborhoods all around the world.
We can create a local [Groupon]( which offers 50% - 90% off these coupons and sells them (for Bitcoins) to consumers who visit these merchants. 
It's a win-win.
2) However, the incentives don't just end there. When a merchant A's coupons ends back with him. It's not the same token that he first issued to 'Bombay Coupons'. When he issued that coupon to you, it was only redeemable at his wallet. Now, it came back with a contract with BombayCoupons and is redeemable by him and a 1000 other merchants. In affect, when a merchant accepts his own coupon which he used to advertise with, it creates a network affect allowing him to spend that coupon (once he has accepted it for services) to spend it at a 1000 other merchants.
And this is just he start!!! :-]
If you decide to take on this project, I would love to help.... but like I said, I am half a world away from Bombay. I'm learning NodeJS, Angular and other open source technologies to try to do this in an environment that is most conducive to the open source world. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 17:41:53
AFAIK, Gavin had concerns about (1) the amount of increase of block size, (2) cap on that increase; on the BIP 100 proposal.
Soon after a newer draft of that proposal addressed both these concerns. So, I really thought that he was on board, especially since the rest of the core devs also seemed on board with that proposal.

I met Lamar (from Pheeva) yesterday at the local Bitcoin meetup organized by Bitpay.
I think they'e done an awesome job in trying to make something for the iOS devices so that people who are tied to them for now can continue to work seamlessly with the Bitcoin ecosystem. They do this by 'playing by Apple's rules' that if they are a "co-op" then they can do things natively in the iOS environment to interact with the Blockchain. I heard him say they are completely vertically integrated with BTC. i.e, they will charge the coop fees in BTC as well and not in USD. I haven't played with the wallet yet, but do intend to but I totallly believe them when they say they want to keep the entire chain of line in BTC and don't want to interact with FIAT.
@_date: 2014-10-17 22:35:57
To actually simply this with the example you gave.
Say Merchant A sells a beer for 10 ACoins. (You create a contract between ACoins and BombayCoupons in a certain exchange rate -- say 1 ACoin = 2 BombayCoupons).
Merchant B sells beer for 20 BCoins. (Contract: 1 BCoin = 1BombayCoupon)
Merchant C sells beer for 30 CCoins (Contract: 1.5BombayCoupons = 1 CCoin, etc, etc.).
As a network grows, the wallet behind the scenes will be able to do the interchangeability in milliseconds without the end-user knowing much about it.
There are a lot of 'boundary conditions' that will be handled when you are creating contracts.
For instance
When you have a contract between A and B, and one contract between B and C. If you try to create a contract between A and C which does not equate to the transitive relationship of Ax = By = Cz, then the system will automatically warn you.
@_date: 2014-08-29 00:41:05

The whole premise of Bitcoin is to removed 3rd parties. There is no 'third' party to have to rely on for trust. Whether it is benevolent government or any organization like WTO or World Bank fall under that 3rd party category. That was the utopian vision Satoshi envisioned and it is in direct contradiction to what Allaire wants or is contemplating.
The protocol itself is quiet transparent and open. The development and rules on how things work are all open and transparent. There already is regulation on Bitcoin. Its in its open source nature.

If you stick to the bitcoin ecosystem. i.e, buy and sell in Bitcoin, you are not subject to the transaction fees. The fee is more related to entering and exiting out of FIAT.
In this case, when dealing with FIAT, merchants deal with heavy chargebacks and all sorts of other fees, and so in order to cover their costs, they charge higher fees.

US regulations apply to banks overseas (especially if the same banks are also operating inside the US borders), that they have to meet some reporting obligations on US clients.

I've heard that TOR was developed by the Navy. Do you stop trusting TOR. TOR's trust lies not in WHO built it but WHAT it is. The 'What' is open source, for anyone to review. Same is true for Bitcoin. 
The NSA is made up of people. Yes, the same people who are subject to the manipulation of a nation-state and do things that are in the best interest of the 'organization' as dictated by its hierarchy. But I'm sure that there are people in there just like the general society who can see for themselves. And see that what NSA is doing is not the best in a lot of ways. Not for the world, not for the citizens that the organization represents. Edward Snowden was a government employee. Would you stop trusting him?

Say, you are an running a online directory of all the merchants/restaurants/service providers, etc. around your neighborhood. You go to them and say, I would like for you to list your business on our site. Instead of paying us in Rs. (or any other FIAT way), you can just issue us your own coupons (which expire in 1 year for instance). People will be willing to issue their own coupons more easily to get free publicity than pay you the scarce FIAT money. That coupon however is only usable at Merchant A.
Now you go to Merchant B, C, D...etc.
Now your site issues it's own coupons -- 'BombayCoupon' that can be used at ALL the merchants that are listed on your online directory. Why, because you are able to control contracts for all of them..since you control all the coupons that you hold.  
You could sell these coupons for a discount on their face value ... FOR BITCOINS!
Your 'BombayCoupon' will work on every merchants wallet that issued their own coupon because the contract exists on the Blockchain between their own issued coupon and your coupon.
There are more use-cases...but hopefully this is a good start.

2. Do you have any wallets with all coinprism (color features) on iOS, Android?

It's simple:
When you compare a well-defined unit of measure (say inches) to a completely arbitrary one (like the distance between two steps taken by Mr. Famous Person that we all know exists ) to "find the value" of one or the other of those units of measure, you'll always get an answer that can be manipulated, cheated, coerced, or downright be driven by forces which can never give us an accurate idea of the "value" of any of these units of measure. 
Imagine a discussion talking about, *'today the value of inches does not look good in Mr XYZ-steps... or man, inches are kicking xyz-steps' ass - all the way to the moon"*. **It's crazy, isn't it?**
Bitcoin's true value is that it will send a very well defined token that cannot be forged, counterfeited, is open, does not need any trusted third party from me to you or you to me. It is that "inch" in the above analogy. 
And what it's about to measure is what we'll start seeing from here on out.

I really like this comparison. And I've been contemplating on it for the last few hours. I have a few questions.
Our local farmer is about to issue a coupon called 'Gaia Bucks' which will expire on 12/31/2015. He issues them every year and for next year, I've 'semi-convinced' him on doing this on the Blockchain. He doesn't use phones much on some of the market days and people actually give him the physical coupons to get the food. 
How can I take the Gaia Bucks that I've created on my coinprism wallet and actually create some really nice 'paper wallets'? Something like what bitaddress.org does but for the assets created on OA.
Any ideas?

If you have yourself already 'claimed' that you are doing something. (For instance "we will give 10% of the proceeds to charity xyz), then it's not about privacy. It's about a claim you are making and you can back that up by Blockchain. 
Privacy is already inherent in the Blockchain. Don't associate yourself with a particular Bitcoin address publicly. But if you are advertising a claim, you can very openly verify that. This truly is what is exemplary. Imagine being able to watch how Red Cross or Wikimedia spends your donations. 
In this instance Bitpay is very publicly saying we paid ESPN for x in BTC. How Bitpay (who btw I am a fan of) spends its money is its own business. But IF they are making a public claim then now, they have very easy and open tools to verify it. THAT is awesome.

When would this be? 
I would like to see something where you can create a distributed identity (on the Namecoin Blockchain) and then issue a callable asset using CounterpartyD. In other words, create a 'coupon' that has a certain expiry date. (In affect you will get all the benefits of a bitcoin -- can't double spend, can't counterfeit, instantaneous around the world, censorship resistant, etc.). 
THEN comes the interesting part. Create a contract between two separate coupons. A coupon issued by A and one issued by B. 
A simple wallet that accepts your coupons that you issued (and any others that you have a contract with). The wallet would accept contracts that are n-levels deep. In other words, if the user of Wallet A issued coupons A and has contracts with B, he can accept A and B coupons... and if B has a contract with C, then A can also in real time accept coupons of C. 
End users will never really deal with unfamiliar and weird looking addresses and their namecoin identity will be attached to the underlying bitcoin/counterparty addresses. This will allow for ease of use and on-boarding.
I moved away from Microsoft technologies a year ago and coming up to speed with NodeJS, Angular and Python. So, I can help ...but I'm no where near Bombay. 
I wish you well though on whatever project you decide to do. Keep us posted.

I'm sorry you feel this is off-topic. I'm so gung-ho about the Blockchain that I tend to view a lot of geo-political issues through the prism of how this technology will affect and bring change.
This is one of the most tacit and clear admissions by a major political figure on how it has become more difficult to "govern people" because they have access to more information now. In my opinion, value is just a piece of information. So far, the banks and governments have controlled it. The Blockchain is the first censorship resistant technology that has learnt how to define and persist value that can be as easily passed around as any other packet of data on the internet!

@_date: 2014-10-17 22:27:15
No... they don't all need to agree on the interchange-ability at all. Every thing is 'relative' (just like energy -- E = MC2) :-].
Let me explain. 
Say, the corner Haldiram Sweets Shop gives you 1000 HaldiCoupons (100 HaldiCoupons buys you a nice lunch), for placing his listing. Your BombayCoupons directory has a good idea of the value of these 1000 HaldiCoupons so you say 100 BombayCoins = 1000 HaldiCoupons in a contract on the Blockchain. 
Now, the Meena Bakery also places its ad and gives 20000 Meena Coins (100 Meena-Coins buys you a nice chocolate cake). As an intermediary working with Meena Bakery, you understand the value of those 20000 Meena-Coins as well and you decide that 1000 BombayCoins = 20000 MeenaCoins -- you create that contract on the BlockChain as well.
1000 HaldiCoins == 100 BombayCoins == 2000 MeenaCoins.
Such a transitive relationship can go on and on. In fact, this shows that someone holding 100 Haldicoins could exchange them for 200 MeenaCoins (by using BombayCoins as an intermediary). 
The complexity of all this will be handled by the wallet itself and would be streamlined for the end-user. Every new relationship created anywhere in the network will allow it to relate to existing relationships. (Say BombayCoins adds more of these contracts, this will benefit both Meena and HaldiCoins and vice-versa).
A value of any particular coin will be its 'relationships' on the Blockchain.
There's more to this. I've thought of a standardized way to create these relationships so that they are easily discoverable regardless on which Blockchain they are in. But this would be a good start.

Local Economies - The more interconnected people are locally, the more resilience they will show to disasters like the ones you are theorizing. 
And we can build these local economies on top of the BlockChain! Most of the technologies already exist. Distributed Identity (OneName, BitID, etc) combined with on chain issuance of assets (MSC, CounterParty, Colored Coins) combined with off chain transference and transactions of such assets (HyperLedger, Open Transactions, etc). 
I'm more optimistic now than I have been for a while. :)

How about something like LightHouse (or OpenBazaar) be able to allow people to issue their own token on top of the Blockchain via various open protocols -- counterparty, coloredcoins, MSC, etc?
Would that not help with the crowdfunding model? Any asset that is issued could be through multi-signature transactions for a more distributed control on decisions.
If a project becomes successful (in terms of Bitcoin adoption), then Bitcoins coming in for that project get distributed along with the distribution model of the coins as a dividend.

It's one thing to build a space station on the ground. It's a whole together another game to make changes to the space station while it's orbiting the planet. 
Just last week Gregory Maxwell and Peiter Wiulle discovered issues with OpenSSL, a few weeks before that they issued a roadmap on how in 20 years Bitcoin could handle EVERY single transaction on the planet.

Hypothetically speaking:
    If Median BlockSize for last 3 months = 1 MB,
    then new_max_blocksize = 2MB;
    If Median Blocksize for the next 3 months = 2 MB,
    then new_max_blocksize = 4MB;
    If Median Blocksize for the next 3 months =4 MB,
    then new_max_blocksize = 8MB;
i.e, in 9 months you could be at 8MB, and according to most technical experts that is not a safe limit. A few users could potentially keep up the transaction rate high enough to sustain a high transaction rate (for months) which will result in doubling the blocksize to levels that could compromise decentralization. 
Is that not a possibility?
@_date: 2015-01-14 03:59:49
From what I read, it looks like P2SH and Multi-sig transactions took some time before there were real products, wallets, apps, etc using it. In fact from the Bitstamp Fiasco, you get the idea that its still being rolled out. 
But I have a feeling we will be seeing a lot of this. Not necessarily in the wallets that want FIAT or merchants settling payments that are denominated in FIAT. But a lot of other really awesome areas. StorJ is implementing it and I'm sure there are others. I have some ideas for it myself.
@_date: 2014-08-04 18:39:01
The company has to pass the 'Legitimacy test' of processors who will convert FIAT to BTC.

In the next few months, there will be a major overhaul to how transactions are stored in the blockchain. Every transaction contains within it the cryptographic signatures that allow you to transfer the bitcoins and also create new encumbrances for the addresses that you are transferring to.
These signatures (which are usually majority of the data) by being moved out of the actual transactions itself will allow [for some really cool features to be built on top of bitcoin]( 
This would require some downstream changes in wallets as well and [most major wallets have expressed support for this feature already]( 
And its good to see that Bitpay will now be supporting this as well.

In the long run, the biggest asset any chain will have is not the amount of $$$ chasing the bitcoins (i.e, the value of bitcoins in term of some FIAT unit), nor would it be the amount of hashing power used to power that particular network. 
It would be, IMO, the developers that are building and converging over any particular ecosystem. The raw brain power is really the true asset here. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 23:15:00
Core isn't changing PoW but NOT considering it as an option IN the event of a hard-fork already happening would be irresponsible. The hard-fork will undoubtedly create two chains, and at that point the core devs can decide whether they want to pursue the same PoW or change it to protect the original 1 MB chain from being attacked by hashing power of the miners. 
A lot of people, particularly in the tech side of things feel the road-map from core is the more responsible way to scale and I would hate to see that roadmap abandoned in the event of a hard fork, which I still feel is very very very unlikely.

Counter 'party'. All sorts of parties and middle men are kaput. As far as I am concerned, their are only two parties: 1) sender, 2)receiver. 
If your business model on the Blockchain introduces any other actors between these two, it would be inefficient and the block chain hates inefficiencies. 
@_date: 2015-04-09 16:45:37
I'll try.
Imagine if you have an idea and you create a company/entity/organization that can issue some sort of equity to people who help you build and bring into fruition whatever your idea is. You can start giving these people equity that is represented entirely on the block chain. You don't need to go incorporate with any central government, issue shares, worry about counterfeiting of shares or them being double-spent.
With Assembly.com, you put your idea out there. Have other people join your project. You initially issued 1 million jrm2007_coins and a 100 people all got interested, so you gave 900,000 of these new coins to these 100 people and kept 100,000 for yourself. 
Now when the capital inflow (say Bitcoins, or USD or any such thing) starts coming into your organization, it will automatically get divied up based on how much of those jrm2007_coins every one has. Say the first year your project made a cool 1000 bitcoins. Based on equity, 100 (10%) will go to you for the 100,000 (10% of original issued amount) jrm2007_coins that you own the other 900 bitcoins will go the other 100 people involved in the project based on their ownership of the amount of jrm2007_coins.
Does it help?

The most important comment I found in that github PR:


I have a good feeling about this. We WILL congeal onto some version of a UASF sooner or later, and this whole conundrum will have become a huge blessing in disguise, because this will take away the power from the centralized miners and hand it off back to the users.

Yes, much to the chagrin of obfuscating the true nature of money.
Money (as in FIAT currency) is NOT limited, but it is scarce.
Bitcoin is limited, but it is NOT scarce.
It's a subtle difference, but a very important one.

I've been playing around with [Copay]( and have been really impressed with it.
It's built on the node.js stack so I think it should be easy to port onto other devices. My experience has just been on the desktop and on testnet, but so far it looks and behaves great.

There is a difference between being 'limited' and being 'scarce' (i.e, insufficient). The total number of units in the bitcoin network 21,000,000 * 100,000,000 is definitely not scarce.
It is however limited.

This is a very real possibility. Sites like Coursera and Khan Academy are already challenging the status quo and verifiability of courses taken can still be done even with centralized solutions but they have not become mainstream yet. Blockchain could change that. 
However, another area where education system might see disruption is also how education systems themselves receive funding. Right now all institutions interested in moolah cowtow to where that funding comes from. The source of funding itself will be very diversified in the future I hope. 
We are creating a little course called yoganomics to teach elementary school kids. It will be 3 session class with each session taking about 2 hrs taught over 3 weeks. By the time kids complete it, they would have learnt more about money, inflation and the effects of interest on money. The course will be crow funded directly by parents through lighthouse. 
No need to go through a centralized county/state education board to get funding for this. :)
If more teachers/parents adopt this model, we can kiss the No-Child's-behind-left and Common-core systems good bye. 
More choices + opt-in (rather than out) = better education system.

If you're paying close attention, Bitcoin mining itself is gravitating towards the lowest and the most efficient cost of energy production. Miners are co-locating in places where there is cheap, abundant, renewable energy. 
Soon, we'll find better uses of the heat dissipation from the mining operation thus making it a beneficial standpoint in terms of using the energy. In Russia, in a small mining farm the excess heat generated was used to heat a few homes.

As long as you value bitcoin to some 'floating price', you will just be limiting your imagination. Bitcoin doesn't derive its value because of its 'price' compared to some FIAT currency. It's intrinsic value is in its own properties. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 23:48:12
When you send bitcoins to any address, they are sent with 'conditions' attached to it.
Usually, when you send bitcoins to an individual's address, it's called a 'pay to public key hash' (P2PKH). The condition attached to this transaction is that in the future when you want to spend money in this address, you will have to show the ["public key and a digital signature corresponding to the private key".](
For Multi-Sig, the conditions are a bit different. Instead of paying to a public-key, you pay to a script hash (P2SH). While spending these coins then you will have to satisfy the conditions of that script hash. Some of which could be that it needs 2 of 3 signatures.
And Andreas' book does a very good job in explaining this.
Also, the developer guide on Bitcoin.org's website explains this fairly well.

Cinder blocks won't serve that purpose because they really are not transportable and not divisible like gold is. 
It also seems that every successive unit of cinder block takes the same amount of effort as the previous one, and that if actually more people join in creating it, then it doesn't reduce the pie for the people that are already in it.
I actually agree with you Bitcoin (and gold) are valuable for their 'utility' and little else. That utility is that Bitcoin and gold share some awesome properties to make them into that 'unit' in which to measure our value.

The problem is a more sinister one. That 11th token was never created. Its not in the system. Yes, people see the value in giving an additional token for the 10 they used for exchanging. People would happily pay for that additional token when they see the value it has provided.
The issue is that if you only have 400 tokens in the system and now the demand is of 440 because of the 10% interest, where do you get the additional 40 from? The token guy only created 400 tokens.
That additional demand of 40 tokens without adding to the supply (of only 400) is where that artificial scarcity comes from. That is how failure (for some people) is built into the system. This is what in a very subliminal way changes that cooperating spirit to one of competition.

It’s been a very simple problem all along. We haven’t really learnt how to value ourselves.
And I mean that quiet literally. We have not been able to figure out how to value ourselves. This may seem like a spiritual statement, and it is. But it’s also about economics.
We have done it better at some times than others, but we have never quiet gotten it right. And the times that we have done it better were the times when societies witnessed more prosperity, more creativity, more art and more peace.
 
Every day, almost every human in every nation values their efforts in a currency whose fate depends on some centralized authority or a cartel of banks. Every day we buy, sell, pay,exchange, save or gift something of value that is measured in such currency units.
We learnt how to measure distances. From the distance between two atoms to two galaxies. Because we came up with good units to measure it. Whether its the metric system or the American system. The ‘value’ that the inch or a centimeter represents has not changed.
And it’s not just distances. Sound, light, space, temperature. We have done a great job in defining how we value these in their own respective units.
But human effort. That has remained an arcane science at best.
We value ourselves, our dwellings and our efforts using these currency units. At times, we have done a better job than this. Gold has always been valuable because it has carried some very intrinsic properties. It’s fungible, transportable, and holds value.
 
Its the third property that interests people. And thus becomes a ‘medium of exchange’. But what value does it intrinsically hold? It’s the effort that someone put into mining it. No one person controls the entire mining. And because it’s decentralized, the effort that goes into mining more gold is fairly public knowledge. People then value their own worth against the effort it went into mining. And because that piece of gold is fungible and transportable, it very easily carries with it a very important piece of information. How much effort went into mining it? That is the value. We value that effort. And figure out the value of our efforts the more we use gold as a unit to measure our value in.
But most modern mediums of exchange don’t work that way. And the ills of these FIAT units of currencies is the cause of so much misery, destruction and fear. When the very unit that we our measuring our efforts in as a society is being controlled completely by a few bankers, then they decide what the members of the society our really worth. It’s not the individuals that make up that society who learn to value themselves through a medium that is open, decentralized and not controlled by anyone. Its whoever creates those units. No effort goes into creating these units of exchange and how those units are created and destroyed becomes a power in and of itself. A power that can allow a few people to control the destiny of entire societies.
 
Bitcoin has all those properties that gold does, but is in orders of magnitutude better than gold. It’s fungible. Way more fungible. It’s transportable. Way more easily. It’s limited in quantity and can’t just be produced at the behest of some authority figure. And here is the best part. It holds value. Just as their is effort in mining gold, there is effort involved in creating this digital coin. We as societies recognize the effort that goes into mining gold and thus value it accordingly. There is effort involved in creating these coins too. Only, for the most part it isn’t human. A machine does some work. Work that can be measured in clock cycles of the computer processors.
 
Gold has one more unique property. Every unit is treated equally. Whether its the very first Bitcoin that was produced with just a few clock cycles 4 years ago to the latest one which took orders of magnitutude more effort by the computers to produce it. Because ech successive unit is more expensive and harder to mine, it adds value to every other coin produced before it.
 
The day the cost of producing a coin exceeds what the market will bear, people will stop mining them.
 
The strength of any medium of exchange is its adoption. And at the rate Bitcoin is going, it’s only a matter of time before Bitcoins adoption exceeds that of any other fiat currency.

As long as anything that is traded actually EXISTS in the system, I am fine with it. The money (be it USD or any other currency) is just another commodity that is used to exchange other goods and services. When you say that there are 440 'units' of that money in the system,... however there are only 400, then that is a problem.
I haven't decided that interest is a bad thing. The way it is used in our monetary system though is a bad thing. The money used to represent it is NEVER created. The original principal is but that interest is not. 
In a different way, I would say this is like a game of musical chairs. We have 22 individuals chasing 20 chairs. Someone will be left standing. If all 22 individuals were chasing 22 chairs, when the music stopped everyone would have a chair to sit on. 
The 'artificial scarcity' is the money itself. Not the effort or the goods or the services. The money. The unit we are using to represent those goods and services.
@_date: 2013-05-28 22:39:25
There will be 21 M bitcoins ever. And that will be used to transact in. However if you tell the world that there actually are 25 million bitcoins but in reality if you only have 21 million mined, then we will have a problem. 
With current IOUs like USD or Yen or Ruble's that is what happens. I realize that it is at the whims of third parties that those IOUs are circulated (and cause scarcity). But the issue is those third parties are telling you that there are 110 units of some currency, but there only
