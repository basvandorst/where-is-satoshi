I tell them the truth.
Why do you care what the answer is?
If you think it's that big of a deal if it's $10k worth, or $1m worth, who cares?
Why is finance such a big deal to people?
This US is so obsessed with both "the 1%" and "the poor", yet everyone is too insecure to talk about money.

Dear God this was stupid.
This video had literally no idea what the words "reserve currency" even means. In the general, **or** legal definition.
I long for a day when "youtube researchers" are rightly mocked and disregarded as the low intellect jokes they are.
When did we stop seeking knowledge as a culture, and instead start passing around "some asshole with a video"?
No BTC will not become a reserve currency.
And gee, I wonder why? Could it be related to the SDR? /sigh
OP just stop. Your embarrassing the whole cryptocurrency movement.

Gold is a thing that has creation value.
You give me a gold coin I can make jewelry. I can make fillings. I can make electronics. It's a thing that has use as other things.
Bitcoin isn't a thing. And can't be made into a thing.
Gold had value largely based on what it does. Bitcoin doesn't do anything.

So you're going to give him .001 of a thing only for him to watch it drop in value?
Yeah, that's not how you make a fan lol
A) it's such an insignificant amount to look at (WTF is .001 of anything??) That it'll be meaningless.
B) it's free, so he had no skin in the game
C) it's still failing, so he gets to see in real time that he's "right".
In short, that's a terrible tactic lol
