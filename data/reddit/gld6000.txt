Money is simply an agreed upon method of storing and/or transferring value/wealth. That could be US dollars or Bolivars.
It's like writing a check: "I promise you this much value. Go to my bank and get it from them"... However, take away that "agreement" and that paper is worthless.... and why I mentioned the Bolivar.
The magic, and the reason we are here in this subreddit, is that if the WORLD agrees to use Bitcoin as that means of transfer (instead of centralized/corrupt institutions), YOU AND I WILL BE WITNESS TO A FINANCIAL REVOLUTION.

If I was trying to move that wealth, I would buy physical Gold. It's way safer than a speculative coin. 
This all assumes you're trying to "buy back in lower" later. But, what if the rocket takes off without you? Then, trying to buy back in will literally lock in losses. Honestly, I'd sit tight with my BTC and HODL (that IS what I am actually doing).

2 years? I guess "far away from" is pretty subjective.
The halvening should occur around May (6 mos from now). The last All time High was around a year and a half post halvening.
If (and yes, that's a big if) the stock to flow trend model continues to repeat as it has done so, two years form now should be the peak of the new ATH.
For those that trade, sure a two year long position seems far away... for those of us that have been HODL'ing along... two years is nothing.

I don't like either option. 
Let's be real. Most of us "HODL'ers" here lean towards option A... with the not so subtle difference being that if that new system is Bitcoin, being early to the party would be LIFE CHANGING wealth.
A handful of years ago, a Thousand Bitcoin was life changing.
At the peak of 2017, a mere 100 Bitcoin was Life changing.
If this continues, this time maybe a mere TEN Bitcoin could be life changing.
Then, maybe just One... and so on...

I have (and love) the Ledger Nano S.
It plugs in and is powered by your USB port... no battery to go bad. So, in theory, it should "last about ten years" ( a quick google says thats how long flash memory holds out but it's really a function of how often that memory is re-written so maybe even longer).  No use needed to maintain it. Mine sits hidden in a fire/wall safe.
Other than the need for it to be physically present (a good thing), It's seemless to use it compared to any other wallet. It just serves to be the custodian of your private key... keeping it hidden from the actual wallet software. That and the need to physically confirm the transaction with a button press, ensures malware can't send signatures on it's own.

No... but banks could do a work around...
Fractional Reserve Lending could essentially "print" a BTC equivelant. 
Here's what I mean:
We deposit our "real" bitcoin... they lend out an "**eBTC**" (for every one deposited... they lend out 10x) in it's place. Of course your "eBTC" can be cashed in at anytime for "normal" BTC.... 
Yes, this is exactly what they do now with Fiat. To help push the agenda, they can even Centralize the heck out of the "eBTC" and offer lightning fast transfers and piggyback the current commerce systems that are now widely in use.
The trick would be in the bankers getting the general population to accept this. I'm sure they're already thinking of the how right this minute....

Generally speaking, everyone wants more adoption. Well, if you want a bigger group of people you're going to have to loosen your membership requirements. Yes, that means, letting in the sheeple, the plebs, the institutions, and the greedy. If anything there are now *MORE* of those "techy people" you described in sheer numbers... but no, not in percentage. The crowd has been joining the party.

Its easy to understand tht a 51% attack takes MASSIVE compute power.. so let's assume a 51% attack would be VERY expensive...
Let's also assume a 51% attack would DESTROY BTC's value by uindermining the whole "store of wealth" thing.
Finally, let's conclude that investing in an attack , the only return you get is the destruction of the value that you invested. 
So there it is. You'd be cutting off your nose to spite your face.

This post is scary... I get you have your reasons... But, Man... I see your questions as asking:
"How do I take my amazingly secure and unconfiscatable (appreciating) asset and convert it to a continually watered down (by inflation) form of money, and then store it on one of the most scam-able paltforms out there."
There are Sooooo many examples of Paypal having zero issue with locking up your money and charging back your transactions... often sending your account into the negative while you try and clean up the mess.
**Avoid Paypal, Spend Fiat, and Stack Sats.**

**Is it Probably safe? yeah... sure...** As long as you create your own seed etc...
***BUT WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU RISK IT?!***
It seems CRAZY to save $30 then load and compromise your Crypto stash.
I could picture someone smart opening these up, modifying them in some way, and then the devices broadcast your private key back to the thief.
I'd imagine that they would send a swarm of these out there into the market, monitor their "babies", and then one day after everyone feels safe.... suddenly it's all gone.

Not false.
If the value of a single satoshi was ever too large to use for smaller exchanges of good/services, the code can be updated to move the decimal place of a Satoshi as much as you want.... Maybe move it over two more places and now call the smallest unit a "Cent-toshi".

Bitcoin is "peer to peer" ... If you want to avoid the KYC:

This title misses the fact that Fiat isn't flowing into anything.... VALUE/WEALTH is flowing in (or in our currently bear market: flowing OUT of crypto)... those fiats are still out there, but now in someone else's hand.
The more "wealth" that flows in, the more worthless (depreciated) the FIAT becomes.
@_date: 2019-09-28 16:58:01
I guess one would hope that at some point, price discovery would stabilize and then wealth flow in and out of Bitcoin would remain stable with a slight rise over time.
Once, we are in that environment, Many would spend Bitcoin to pay for life's expenses and it's needs and also many "investors" would seek higher returns elsewhere.

I don't need to counter your argument.
All you did was lay out technical hurdles that smarter people are already working on.
Counter MY statement with where the neagtives you pointed out are un-improveable. IMO, your statements are actually opinions..
But, even assuming they were facts "today", Bitcoin, as well as it's infrastructure, is a work in progress.
Your point (while I can clearly see that it is simply meant to trigger educatuted discussion), is like going back in time and  arguing that your PC with an intel 386 at 33mhz could never render proper 3d virtual reality... so therefore we will never achieve it.
Meaning: With progress, Tech improves. The impossible becomes possible.
