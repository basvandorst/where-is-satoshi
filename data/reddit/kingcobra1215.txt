Are iOS wallets safe? Is it pretty easy to transfer the coins to that? 
Never really used wallets or anything, just getting started.
I hear the safest is to store it on an offline device like usb or something, is that true?

Good riddance, hope they keep burning away

Ohhhh so you're one those sorry excuse for humans with a microscopic dick. It all makes sense now, this is why you're so damn stupid.
A piece of shit cunt like you sitting miles away with his weapon to shoot a helpless animal. I pray to all the gods one of them catches you by surprise and mauls you to death. Those are my favorite stories, asshole cunts like you who get killed by the animals. They should make a bedtime story book about them, it's the best kind of stories fills me with joy.

Leather is the skin of dead tortured animals. Do people even know the terrible process in getting that skin from those poor animals?
Can't wait until they become a relic of the terrible past. It's not good for the animals, not good for the environment and planet and isn't sustainable at all.

Hahaha the starving people argument. All the grains and food we feed animals in factory farming would feed millions of starving people. You've proven yourself with your own argument to be a hypocrite ONCE AGAIN. Hahaha
I love proving idiots like you wrong. This has nothing to do with privilege and everything to do with saving both animal and human lives. And that's without even discussing the terrible diseases animal consumption causes. Or the terrible environmental impact factory farming has on the planet.
Again, educate yourself about the topic before getting your panties in a bunch. You're clearly clueless as every "argument" you've presented has literally been AGAINST animal consumption. 
@_date: 2018-10-18 17:19:44
Then will you stop eating animals since they consume a lot more plants to grow and be killed for food than us? Since you're such a plants life advocate?
@_date: 2018-10-18 18:20:55
The animals beg to differ on your idiotic "only the privileged" comment. 
Like I said to your weak argument, if you care so much about plant life then don't be a hypocrite yourself and stop eating the animals, they are the biggest consumers of plants in the world. Do you see how stupid your argument was now or do you want to continue glazing over it like you never said it? Lol what a terrible troll you are
@_date: 2018-10-18 17:09:44
And raising and killing billions of animals isn't? What an ignorant fool you are.
@_date: 2018-10-18 19:17:42
Once again another old outdated cliché joke. Clearly you don't get how stupid you are for making that plants argument so I won't waste any more time on stupid people like you.
Enjoy being an ignorant hypocrite lol and hopefully all those animals you eat give you the most horrible disease imaginable. Karma's a bitch ;) 
@_date: 2018-10-18 19:31:49
The alternatives to killing helpless young animals raised with antibiotics and growth hormones for assholes like this guy.
The only solution is for ignorant assholes like you to finally die away. Only then will the planet get better.

So during times when people are freaking out and losing money in their portfolios, you decide to shill your shirts...
Makes total sense...
@_date: 2018-11-20 00:16:24
That scale is damn terrible, no wonder people end up losing so much money because of crap like this.
52--&gt;80 is the same scale as 8000--&gt;12000?

More FOMO nonsense from clueless bitcoin shills.
@_date: 2018-11-13 09:55:13
Btc is a store of value like gold is.
Yes you can transact in bitcoin just like you can in gold, but there are much easier and quicker alternatives than either.
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:12:56
Lol ouch

Very misleading to those not familiar with logarithmic scales and makes it look like a linear scale. 
"A graph with a log scale which was not clearly labelled as such, or a graph with a log scale presented to a viewer who did not have knowledge of logarithmic scales, would generally result in a representation which made data values look of similar size whilst in fact being of widely differing magnitudes. Misuse of a log scale can make vastly different values (such as 10 and 10,000) appear close together (on a base-10 log scale they would be only 1 and 4). Or it can make small values appear to be negative due to the way in which logarithmic scales represent numbers smaller than the base."

A lot of bitcoin noobs would lose their coins by entering the wrong address or using the wrong wallets etc...
2018 has been bad enough, let's not make it worse on people..
@_date: 2018-12-13 22:37:45
Since bitcoin and crypto in general aren't widely used currently for transacting, I wouldn't fault anyone for not knowing how to move bitcoin around, specially the recent investors only in this for profits.
@_date: 2018-12-13 23:19:59
Until there's an easier way to move crypto around there will always be human error. 
It's not as simple as email in terms of syntax. Bob is a lot easier to read and write the a bunch of letters and numbers that are case-sensitive too.
