And that isn’t capitalism? I’m not talking about political parties.

Venezuela was poor a long time before “socialism”. You only hear about it now because it goes along with America’s “socialism bad” agenda.

I would disagree when you say it’s done the opposite. I’m lazy so i’m gonna copy something I found once.
“The USSR was certainly not a perfect communist state, but it made some great strides economically (I am absolutely not condoning the actions of the state politically. It was absolutely awful what happened. I'm going to focus on numbers. Economics. Because in it's pure form, communism is about economics. Naturally, economics flows into politics but I digress)
Okay so the USSR had more doctors per capita than any other country in the world
Homelessness was non-existent
Literacy was highest in the world at the time, 99%
Continuous economic growth for 70 years straight (excluding WW2 where everyone was getting butt fucked) (yeah they were also booming through the great depression)
Had extremely high calorie average consumption. Actually more than the US in the 1970s
They went from a primarily agricultural society to and an industrial powerhouse, becoming the second to make a nuclear bomb, the first to make a hydrogen bomb, the first animal, man, and woman in space (this is more political but they were incredibly tolerant. They were the first to grant woman's suffrage, and had 4 women on the politburo), the first satellite, and the first probe to orbit the moon. Again, at the time they were doing all of this, they were agriculturally based only 50 years before....
And the biggest point, they fought with the US for 30 years on who was the world's super power. They were either the first or the second (I would argue 1st tbh) biggest world power. Not even at the PEAK of the USSR.”

Yes because having lots of oil translates to wealth for average citizens.

The same way Haiti could be an example of how capitalism fails the general populace.
