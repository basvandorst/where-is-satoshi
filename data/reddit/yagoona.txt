I use gmail and even though I almost never click on links from those I do not know, I have tried to get into the habit of checking what URL the link is actually pointing to.
I guess this is also not fool proof, but since doing this, I have noticed a surprising amount of phishing attacks. Beware!

Bitcoin needs to shake out some of the greed players who profit from volatility.

oops it was a .jar file
So what species of beast is this exactly?
btw AVG came up with nothing wrong.
I don´t believe it and worse I have just lost faith in AVG as well.
Managed to track down the offending file. (searched for .jar files created in the last 24 hours and only found 1 and the time of the file seemed to match the time I clicked on this attachment)
I could not delete the file because it was already open, so I got into Win task manager and stopped all the java.exe processes and then deleted this file.
Hope this does it.
But I don´t know how to know for sure

just got this mail.
Had my guard down after a hard day at work and clicked on the pdf attachment, then saw it was a java script file.
This lead me to search for any phishing attacks and found this thread.
Anyone know what this thing is, and what it does, and can I get rid of it myself?
Just running the AVG free anti virus scan to see if it picks anything up.

Maybe its not such a good idea to show your mug on national TV during a protest with a QR code asking for donations. Face recognition will pin you to that address and funds going though it forever.

Even if ONE person is writing ALL the code, it still takes the consensus of the network to accept the forked change. THAT is the decentralisation.

Me thinks that the acceleration of services for retailers like bitpay that convert BTC purchases directly into fiat may be playing a unintended role here namely of dumping the markets with BTC.
I´d imagine that companies like Bitpay do speculate a little with the large sums of BTC they temporarily hold as they pay out Fiat to the merchants with no appetite for speculation, but maybe their appetites for holding are also weakening.
If this hypothesis has any merit, then we may posit that those spending BTC on all these mainstream outlets, are those that mined early and sit on hordes of BTC. It may be possible to prove this in the blockchain to see if early mined BTC are entering circulation more. Would be interesting.
In the big picture would be a positive re-circulation of these large stashes of BTC that were mined in the early days of Bitcoin.
If I had mined several 000´s of BTC back in 2009, I´d be ramping up my spending of them now I am able to with more and more outlets. I´d think it downright my obligation to Bitcoin to do so. Kind of counter-intuitive results though.

It will not only be Gavin that makes this call.
I truly believe that he is committed to true openness when it comes to such topics.
Since it is opensource, all can see what changes had been made soon after the fact, if not even before (if he publishes the code before the folk for the community to check it).
Then we can all decide for ourselves if its OK
But undeniably, this would be a golden opportunity for the likes of the FED or the CIA or any other nefarious actor to try to destroy, or even better, to circumvent/"backdoor" the bitcoin network. I would not dismiss the risk of this.
I say this with almost total faith in the concept of "opensource", and the peer reviewed transparency it brings.
