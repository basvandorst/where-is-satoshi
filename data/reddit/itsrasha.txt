You show me a construction crewman's paystub for 5 grand a week, union or not, and I'll quit my job right now and work for you.

The foreman might make that, 199 laborers ain't making a quarter million a year.
$1000 per worker per day could be the contracted labor cost, if you have a great negotiator of a PM and the deep pockets of the tax payer.

Neither the president or any other government entity has any control of the USD. Maybe OP needs to read the green paper.

Ingenious way to lower the tax rate of your long term gains!

Probably to due with shipping. I didn't know this was a thing until right now.
Nvm it's literally a token backed by the barrels, like how the USD used to be backed by precious metals.

Oh, it's backed by that Cali Cunt? I guess I'm gonna double the fuck down. This is why we are invested in crypto.

"I can go back in time and make a crypto investment for you of $10, that's poke $40B dollars today!"

Most got in in January,so they have lost everything they out in.

OP said they sold at "$100" after buying BTC at "$10"
Just because they bought another $100 worth immediately after selling at $100 doesn't negate realized gains of $90.

And since he doesn't know who Ron Burgundy is you've only further confused the boy.
@_date: 2019-03-11 18:02:09
Easy, don't buy crypto in any way that's traceable to you, you can't be taxed on what you don't own!
But you owe taxes on $90 of realized earnings.

I had trouble with Wells Fargo today
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:08:26
If I only I could build a history, they have cancelled all but two of my 20ish transaction attempts. Fucking garbage support is non existent it seems.
@_date: 2017-08-28 17:33:56
I was making a joke in light of the memo.

Increase prices by 3-5% to offset for credit card transactions.

No one would be able to access the blockchain. No transfers would authorize, everything would be frozen until enough users were back online to confirm the blockchain.

The affordable health care act, or as I call it *$5000 tax for the middle class* is trash.
Sorry Donald Trump hurt your butt, just hold out for seven more years.

We're hard working and like money....also limiting government....so yeah crypto is right in our wheelhouse.

Show me on the doll where the Republican party hurt you.

Hey look, it's me, your favorite nonprofit.
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:20:38
I know where I'd be today, and who would be fucking right the fuck off.
@_date: 2018-07-20 11:46:38
It's easy, you just give everyone money! Everyone will be rich and no one has to work again! And if you do work, you get to pay a 60% tax rate to support the UBI! They didn't teach you this one in econ101!
@_date: 2018-04-14 17:03:26
Why now and not 19k?
@_date: 2018-12-17 00:25:25
Holy shit, if you guys wanna send me BTC we can save transaction fees! Just DM me your cold wallets and I'll take care of everything!
