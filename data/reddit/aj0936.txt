Do merchants usually create and maintain their own VISA solutions today? No, they pay someone competent to provide this service.

Even today, merchants that run their own solution should be competent enough to set a few parameter and keep up to date on what going one. If not maybe they should not be do it?

I don’t really understand your answer, please elaborate. In most cases it literally boils to just one variable in the software “block max size to accept”.

In my 75% example, I do not think a chain that congested would be valued 4 times higher than its alternative.
With currently ~$1000/minute in block rewards I do believe the miners are gone be very conservative and get important functions onboard before even attempting a fork.

If there is a fork it will probably happen with a lot more than 50% of the hashrate. Remember even with 51% BU will not activate automatically. Currently all BU miners are signaling an acceptance depth of 6 blocks. So they have an economically incentive to coordinate some sort of flagday/block to start. To maximize the success rate they will most likely make this coincide with the difficulty adjustment, so core would have 2016 block for the next adjustment. If they do this at for example 75% I think core is in big trouble. That would mean 8 weeks with 40-minute blocks. With 4x the backlog some of the BU players can also quite easily push the fees to unreasonable heights. Essentially rendering the core chain useless for 8 weeks. I cannot really see the last 25% of the miners staying on this chain.

This is bad, but no code is perfect. The DAO or the 0.8 hardfork anyone?
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:44:04
Your right, it should have been 3 times higher.

Even though it is called Bitcoin Unlimited, isn’t there still a hard limit to max 32MB somewhere in the code?

From my understanding is was a stupid ploy to trick the tax man

Nak probably took around 1750 coins from the 7000 loss. Not sure if he was invested when mechs went from 1700&gt;7000.
@_date: 2013-10-04 10:21:37
What I don’t understand is; why didn’t he a least set aside his initial investment of 2200 (1700 balance + 500 lost to nak)?

Case gets thrown out of court due to evidence tampering :)
