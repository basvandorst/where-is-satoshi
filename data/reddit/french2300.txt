@_date: 2018-05-19 20:33:38
start by trying to make small purchases with your account Pakistan, and check if it goes well
@_date: 2018-05-28 23:14:25
someone here would have an opinion on the jpy (yen)/btc on bitflyer? everything is normal ?
@_date: 2018-05-13 11:07:21
me and another guy; °), it should be all ..
@_date: 2018-05-27 21:06:31
fuck off, can I? just for fun .. I'm 8k long
@_date: 2018-05-20 21:11:11
 long live the queen, bitcoin ....
@_date: 2018-05-12 14:51:37
not the most stupid, it happens to a lot of us. If you are afraid that the price will come to 7k, sell a few pieces of your position with small losses at a price close to your purchase.
@_date: 2018-05-11 10:30:25
Hello ; i think it's a good analysis .. let's see which way bitcoin goes now;
@_date: 2018-05-05 21:52:04
you tell me?
@_date: 2018-05-28 21:35:18
this is not for you .. it's just to see; a test, see if we have the freedom to say what we want ... sorry, it was not for lack of respect .
just to check the censorship, excuse me ;-°] 
@_date: 2018-05-15 22:49:15
disappeared .. what was it?
@_date: 2018-05-18 21:25:14
ok, thanks, $ 8801 $ for tomorrow, if I read right. cool, 9K for Sunday ;-)
@_date: 2018-05-14 13:02:11
not a mt gox wallet. but that of a casino
@_date: 2018-05-15 23:16:58
good luck guys, I'm going to watch the movie "the matrix", just to rest .....
@_date: 2018-05-28 22:17:17
and I am still long at 8k , but keep n is so easy in this atmosphere ..
@_date: 2018-05-11 11:45:47
many like you and me, you just have to hold, the price must go up, the trap is set up to catch bitcoins at a lower price; it is my opinion not a council 
@_date: 2018-05-12 23:20:09
cool, soon 9 k ......
@_date: 2018-05-12 00:01:35
cool, your analysis, plus a guy said this week on r / bitcoin; "May 13 will be a great day of purchase" and "any bitcoin purchased under 10k will be a bargain", I will go to sleep on those thoughts.
@_date: 2018-05-11 14:09:42
no discussion to hide our comments of disappointment today
@_date: 2018-05-27 21:02:33
moi ,j aimerais bien savoir qui a raison ,
@_date: 2018-05-18 19:40:10
do not have a scam attempt? precisely check email links and addresses.
@_date: 2018-05-05 22:11:13
I think what is important is to keep bitcoins ... if you win $ 500 with bitcoin you will be sad to give $ 5? me no ..
@_date: 2018-05-02 09:18:47
be patient the price will come back. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 23:38:20
one of my opinions; a whale has just sold bitcoins bought at MTgox for a private sale, and sold its own wallet ... what do you think? would it be possible to influence the market this way?
@_date: 2018-05-12 14:20:21
be patient a little now, go do something else, liquidate your positions in small pieces or decide to hold a game. personally, that's what I did to get out of this trap.
and maybe you have already made the right choice....
@_date: 2018-05-05 19:10:50
Hello. I come to tell a problem about "kraken". I placed a purchase at 9530 lever 5 . FOR 0.5 BTC, when the price hit the target, the order was automatically canceled by 
 kraken for a false reason. I think I change my platform for this reason.  when the US will be at 10K dollars, I hope that Europe will push for 10 K euros;
@_date: 2018-05-05 20:46:08
9800 $ .an idea ?
@_date: 2018-06-23 22:22:33
a piece of land ..?

@_date: 2018-03-12 23:46:33
I agree, you're right, but I believe in bitcoin, I'm not a professional, it's also for me a way to support the project. I took his chances for several years, not enough to be a millionaire. (Buy 16k .12k .10k 9k 0.3k) .Save losses and benefits. I learned to accept the losses, now I expect more daily use, to enjoy some profits
it was just a tip, every one is free to resell with profits in my plan, or to buy gold .. in bitcoin ....
@_date: 2018-03-15 23:13:40
there is a reason for this wall at 8400. which would be most likely?
@_date: 2018-03-13 00:12:02
which plans are ok? please .
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:58:59
hack binance; sale mtgox liquidation;

MTGOX NEWS .
without affecting the market? ..
@_date: 2018-03-10 11:07:36
attention ..
@_date: 2018-03-26 21:42:14
thank you for the opinion, and if the news is good for futures contracts, the price could go up?
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:57:05
we are going to see ....

@_date: 2018-03-17 23:33:56
Hello . I hope the bullish trend of the weekend will take place on Sunday. if it happens .... a little patience can be ..?
@_date: 2018-03-27 22:40:40
to follow the price, to wait and reflect on what can be allowed to lose, and the moment when a good tendency presents itself. but if you want to go home now you might get burned ..
@_date: 2018-03-10 21:54:41
it may be time to sell a little, so ...? 
for me i bought 8900 usd, 10000, 15000 and still a lot of stress when i watch kraken live, but in the end i know that bitcoin will grow in the near future and will go at a higher price.
perhaps, that mtgox liquidation will create a chance to compensate the losses of the holders of bitcoins due to the massive sale of their liquidation fund. we have to restart the rest of the fund in xb find according to the percentage of each bitcoiner. This dedomage stress ...
@_date: 2018-03-27 22:47:34
What is this madness ? it's too high, there's a problem, I think
@_date: 2018-03-28 21:29:14
Hello . I understand that I am in a similar situation, but the stress comes from the decline, ... it would be better to keep some of its bitcoin stock and come back later, in another condition. and you can live with your companion other great things ... and in the end you will surely gratify
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:49:03
surely the lawyer Nobuaki Kobayashi .can be also, google boycott selling bitcoinss?
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:50:03
the rise of Sunday ...
@_date: 2018-03-10 21:13:37
sorry, I'm French, I say that I'm wrong in my question, because I just look at the volume on kraken, and I found that low sales volumes bring down the price, more than usual, in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:54:24
can be a good time to buy x10 lever? .all the world blocks 0.01 in the chain in order to pay a trip to the moon. 
to go I start ..
@_date: 2018-03-26 22:49:26
a coordination of markets, and a great bitcoin master ..
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:07:19
Bitcoin has been very useful in financial transactions, and it will remain so. At this time, financial interest is being recovered, perhaps term contracts. beware of this manipulation ...
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:38:26
what are all these sales, who? Asia wakes up, it's 7am.
@_date: 2018-03-15 23:26:29

@_date: 2018-03-17 00:13:09
we can see the lambo buy in August 2017 .....
@_date: 2018-03-27 22:45:43
What is this madness ?
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:33:48
a person here, could tell me that these sales do not come from mtgox liquidation, with certainties ???
@_date: 2018-03-10 21:33:35
but in this manipulation, who would be interested in lowering the price too much? because the price is too low, there is no interest.
@_date: 2018-02-27 09:07:08
Hello, here in France, we will make you go green candles this morning
@_date: 2018-03-21 23:42:07
and olive in the ass, if it continues ...
@_date: 2018-03-10 20:53:58
why low sales volume have such a significant impact on the BTC?
I am wrong ?
@_date: 2018-03-26 16:02:26
I would be trying to agree, I do not know why ..
@_date: 2018-03-27 21:07:13

why so many people banned from: r / bitcoin today? Me with ...
@_date: 2018-04-29 19:28:42
not necessarily, it depends how you set up your wallet
@_date: 2018-04-06 22:52:35
I doubt that all these purchases or sales of hundreds of bitcoins are made by fans of technology .. and what is the advantage if I lose fiat?
@_date: 2018-04-29 14:52:15
it's too easy as you say, but be careful the trap can be closed, be careful ..
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:06:23
en attente 15000 ...
@_date: 2018-04-06 23:41:35
the maximum that we can lose and patience .. not motivating ... but ...
my opinion attention shorts the price will go up this weekend .. just my opinion .. I went into the trap ..
@_date: 2018-04-06 22:43:31
with such a linear price, it would be easy to use in everyday transactions?
@_date: 2018-04-29 15:06:03
mustard of Dijon please, I bring back the Belgian Beer
@_date: 2018-04-30 21:35:11
