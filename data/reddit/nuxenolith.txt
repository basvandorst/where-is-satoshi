The US GDP is close to 17 trillion dollars.  Your number is  5.9 thousandths of a thousandth of a percent of that.

Bitcoin is never going to be a fiat currency.  It'll always be a fringe alternative.

Well, I don't see how snooping through my comment history is a fair evaluation of me as a person.  If you cared to know, I'll be graduating with an engineering degree in 3 weeks, so it's not like I'm some great dumb idiot.

Oh right, you mean "Russia".

He is unsuccessful.  He inherited his wealth from his father and turned it into less money than he would have gotten by investing it all into the S&amp;P 500.

You do realize you literally just equated "success" to "being born into money", right?

I love you guys; you can't hold a single argument without resorting to namecalling, because you can't back anything up with critical thinking.  For as much as you guys complain about the sensitivity of liberals, you sure are incapable of acting on anything other than pure emotion.

Hedge funds typically profit due to unscrupulous fund managers charging the pants off hapless investors with exorbitant expense ratios.  Nobody gets rich off of index funds; that's not the point of them.  The point is to grow your wealth securely.  I'm not ignoring anything; these are the facts.
Trump, on the other hand, has had over 3 decades to prove he can beat the market, and guess what?  He can't.  Active investors will have hits and misses, but over a large enough sample size, a trend emerges.  Hindsight won't guarantee future results, but it is literally the only way to evaluate the body of his work.

Index funds that benchmark the total market have been widely acknowledged to be the safest vehicle for investment, and we've known this for a long time.  Anyone with a 401(k) plan through their work knows to allocate elections such that their portfolio is as diversified as possible, as this reduces risk while maximizing utility.
Even Warren Buffett said, when he dies, to put what remains of his estate for his wife into index funds, because he doesn't trust anyone else to beat the market. (As the world's most famous stock picker, that made a huge splash.)

Anyone who sold yesterday had to consider the possibility that it would bounce back today.  Just like you need to consider the possibility that it will drop again tomorrow.

If I'm being honest, as an outside observer with no stake in crypto, it's kind of depressing to me seeing people so ardently convinced that coins will be their salvation.
You all need to remember that crypto is speculation.

Anyone who was willing to invest money and got torched by the ICO will not be so eager the second time around.  And they will tell their friends.  Trust is not so easily won when it's your wallet bleeding.

Please consider the possibility that he's right.

Please, tell us what you know that everyone else doesn't.

This situation is identical to the dot-com bubble of the late '90s.  Cryptos clearly hold some place in the future, but it'll take a while to regain that trust in the public at large.

Small nitpick, but the expression is "Pigs get fat, **hogs** get slaughtered."  I agree with most of what you've said though.

The same reason as everyone else: optimism.  Whether they have good reasons or bad reasons to believe that comes down to the individual.

If you're that worried, set some rules for yourself and be honest with them.  Sell off a fixed percentage of your initial investment at regular intervals (like 1 BTC every 3 months), REGARDLESS of how high or low it moves.
The only way to realize gains (or losses) is to sell.  If you want to ensure you walk away with something, you need to make that call.

Because all the ICO scams will lead to drastically lower confidence in lesser-named coins.

But it already dropped to 6k?
