This is copy-pasted from a statement from Ty Smith, the ICO Director of Amulet, but it gives a good explanation of derivatives and their usage in cryptocurrency:
" Before joining the crypto world I was an equity derivatives broker on Wall Street so it's something I've studied in depth. I will, however, try to keep my explanation short. Derivatives are assets who's value is derived from the value of another underlying asset. One example of derivatives is options. An option is a contract that states its holder can purchase a set amount of shares (100 in most cases) at a certain price before a set expiration date. As the value of the underlying shares fluctuate, so will the value of the option. If I have a contract that says I can buy 100 shares of IBM at $155 it will obviously be worth much more if IBM's stock appreciates to $165 per share. There are countless types of derivatives. Common ones you may have heard of include futures, options, forwards, and swaps but there is also a slew of non-traditional proprietary derivatives called 'Exotics'. Every type of derivative is used differently but the most common usage is for hedging (limiting risk) when trading. Going back to the example of options; lets say I own a large amount of AAPL shares at $230. I'm worried that the price might decrease by a value more than I am willing to bear but I still want to keep ownership of my shares. To limit this risk, I can purchase a contract that allows me to sell AAPL shares at a certain price. This type of option is called a 'put' whereas a contract that allows me to buy in the future is called a 'call'. The crypto derivative market is almost non-existent which makes hedging very difficult. By allowing traders, even novice ones, to more easily manage their risk, Amulet hopes to add another dimension to the cryptocurrency trading industry.  "
