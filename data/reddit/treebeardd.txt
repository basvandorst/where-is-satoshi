Not fear. Reasonable caution.

@_date: 2015-12-17 15:34:41
$1.50 per transaction sounds high, yes, but when those transactions are lightning network channels that service 100s or 1,000s of transactions it will be worth it.

I'n also keeping in mind the fact that in some countries a secure outbound transaction is basically impossible with credit cards.
@_date: 2015-12-17 20:52:41

@_date: 2015-06-09 01:58:23
The question: Should we expand blocksize from 1MB?
Pro-increase: More transactions possible per block/per second.
Con-increase: More "low-value" transactions sitting in the blockchain, forever.
@_date: 2015-12-23 21:32:03
If it gets repeated often enough some people believe anything.
@_date: 2015-12-17 20:53:12
That money goes to miners and makes the network more secure for everyone.
@_date: 2015-12-17 20:58:05
What will happen when a legit transaction is compared to another legit transaction? Probably the same thing that will happen for every other A vs. B transaction comparison, the miner will pick the one with more fees/byte.
Putting a limit on the blocksize is to protect those that operate full nodes, which are the on- and off-ramps to the network. These operators do not get any of the fees unless they are also miners, in which case they are also paying for mining equipment.
@_date: 2015-12-17 21:20:31
I wonder if there's some way to implement that on a side chain.
@_date: 2015-12-09 03:49:42
SPOILER ALERT!!! Kidding.
@_date: 2015-12-17 19:30:44
Who is this 'we' that's going to raise prices? You have reversed cause and effect sir. The only way fees could *possibly* reach 50 bucks would be if it *were* packed with people willing to pay $49.99. And $49.98, $49.97 etc.

Ok keep telling yourself that. But it is very possible for a minority to be correct and the majority to be wrong. This sub-reddit is in the hands of theymos, and I 100% understand and agree with his logic because I actually understand computers, bitcoin and the Internet and I'm not just some jump-on-the-bandwagon troll who thinks tweaking 1 number is some brave solution to scaling bitcoin. The XT split could have been (and still could be) a disaster for bitcoin that has the potential to sink both Core and XT, for no better reason than stupid FUD about needing to 'scale bitcoin' in the most lazy way possible.

@_date: 2015-12-22 15:01:41
Some people think no one will be able to ise bitcoin if the fees are higher. That logic makes no sense to me because the only way fees could get higher is if and only if lots of people are using bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-17 21:07:49
Bitcoin has the largest user network and proof of work effort of any 'coin', if that actually mattered to overstock they would use bitcoin, which I understand they are using it for time stamping. I don't think overstock is looking to make bitcoiners or altcoiners rich through trading stock on their network. If all they want is rapid settlement + bypassing traditional institutions, they could have that with a roll-your-own IT solution.
@_date: 2015-12-07 13:19:36
No. Mining firms have lots more costs ie hardware electricity etc.
@_date: 2015-12-18 01:21:56
Well it depends if you look at security in relative or absolute terms. In absolute terms 5% of hashing power is 95% less secure. In relative terms 5% may be adequate. In fact, why do we need any proof of work at all? I mean we can all easily check if a transaction has valid inputs and a valid signature isn't that good enough? Why even include it in a block at all? Why do wasteful PoW at all? 
@_date: 2015-12-07 14:05:39

Bob needs to be moving a lot of capital to make this system worth his time. If hes not making at least as much money moving bitcoin as he could be making doing something else, hes going to do something else. To move money he has to have enough savings/capital to be able to sell in enoigh volume so he can support himself. That means handling several times the local daily wage every single day.

@_date: 2018-05-02 17:53:26
Probably by issuing even more debt.
@_date: 2014-07-01 22:23:00
It depends on the size of the transaction in kilobytes and how recently those coins have been moved. The more ~~recently~~long ago the coins have been moved, the less a fee is needed. These factors determine the priority of a transaction, and a high priority transaction like the gov coin transaction doesn't need a fee.
EDIT: fixed recently/added long ago

The snorkel is attached to a mask which is strapped to your face so both of your hands are always free swim/do other stuff. Once you get a bit comfortable snorkeling, you can do "duck dives" by taking a big breath then exhaling slowly while diving to keep water out of the tube. With practice this can get you some pretty good and pretty smooth diving time, though of course nothing like SCUBA times.

@_date: 2014-01-01 10:09:11
Wrong. The values of all currencies fluctuate.  People work around it. Price fluctuations will not stop widespread adoption, but widespread adoption will stop price fluctuations. There's a huge difference between fluctuations and a crash/hyper-inflation. BTC is sooo small compared to all world fiat currencies that of course it's going to fluctuate. How could it not?
Of course people work in dollars in their heads... it's what we're used to and it's what we need to use in "real life." When the euro first hit the scene its value was worked out in terms of franks/marks/whatever originally but as people got used to it, this became unnecessary. The same will happen for btc.
These are the early days of bitcoin. Expect bumps. Life is a wild ride and stability cannot be expected, we have to make do with what we got. Even standing still is making a choice. Please just try to relax and not worry about price fluctuations halting adoption, I've seen the price fluctuate from $5 to $1200 and adoption has only gone up!

Yeah, I think the solution will be slightly different in every country. Most countries seem to have some sort of their own local payment system. Hopefully even if bob is "unbanked" in the most traditional sense, he can become "banked" by using cellphone minutes as currency which he can buy with bitcoin. Cellphone minutes/credit can hopefully become an intermediate link between bitcoin and local fiats.

Or C: purposefully slowly ramping up the hash rate so that you can capture more bitcoins during a certain time. Say you have a huge amount of hashing power available, do you turn it all on at once? No, because the network will re-adjust right away and return to giving you 25btc/10min. But if you slowly ramp it up, capturing more and more of every block, you can try to trick the network into not creating as big of a jump when difficulty re-adjusted. Then when difficulty re-adjusts, you just turn on some more of your hashing equipment. Whether this is a more viable strategy than just going "all-in" ie bringing 100% of hashing power online as soon as possible is purely theoretical I think.. 
@_date: 2014-12-01 11:27:53
Still, I think the costs of "bank-level bitcoin" (ie electricity, server hardware, wallet hardware (which can be pretty much any laptop or smartphone), we can assume the internet already exists, no need to re-pay-for that) is at least 1-3 orders of magnitude smaller than visa + mastercard + banks etc. More importantly, bitcoin automatically scales itself up or down to whatever market level of demand is actually placed upon it in real life aside from us randomly speculating about it on a forum.
As for your second point, of course I don't expect the "legacy banking system" to go away any time soon, and I don't consider myself a hypocrite for using it, or if I am a hypocrite for using it, then so be it. I don't go out of my way to support it, but I don't beat myself up about having a savings account, using credit cards (paying off my balance in full each month of course) etc. In fact, I use my credit card much more than I use bitcoin so that I can build credit and get cash back. (Plus its more widely accepted of course). I use bitcoin for what it's best for right now: putting money away for the long term as a hedge against inflation.

I think it hasn't dawned on people yet how important the next block halving will be... and the next, and the next. When 75% of all bitcoin has been mined and the remaining 25% will take 100+ years, people will start to realize how low these prices really are.
@_date: 2014-10-01 16:11:28
I think a key to the answer might be the fact that bob's relationship with his "bank" in theory only needs to be 1 directional: selling bitcoin for something to give to aunty (either local currency or cell phone minutes etc). Bob's business model is never expected to do the reverse, ie get bitcoin from local cell phone minutes/currency etc. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 15:40:00
Great post, I think you really get it. I think "bob"'s biggest challenge is to find a person to trade his btc supply to for local currency. He needs to be able to sell it to someone for local currency to replenish the stock he is giving out to the aunties.
So he needs to sell his btc for local currency. I don't think there's a good answer for this problem yet. Maybe he can get cell phone minutes with it and sell those. Maybe he can use it to order internationally. 
@_date: 2014-10-02 10:32:16
I'm just saying, just because "Bob" has a small business doesn't mean he has enough capital to front 1-5k $/day out to his customers. I guess we can assume he has the chance to sell his bitcoin for local currency before auntie shows up. 
If he charges 2%, he will have to move 25 daily-wage-size transactions per day to make HALF of daily wage. That's a lot of people coming out of his store flush with cash all day, it could become an issue. I agree, just do it though! :)

Off-blockchain ledgers can still be extremely decentralized and diverse. Every user is free to decide which ledger they want to entrust their coins to what kind of trust model they want to use. Or they can pay a tiny mining fee to make their transaction a first-class citizen. Bitcoin will still be globally accessible, you can even easily afford to run your own node if you want to, for maximum security.

The problem isn't sending the bitcoin as remittances, that's easy. The problem is creating a market for BTC in countries with poorer infrastructure, ie what value does bitcoin have locally in poor countries. Pretty much none, unless there are 'rich' people there trying to buy it up as a hedge against inflation. It's all about adoption I guess.

Fair enough, but ive never heard of them before.
@_date: 2015-05-12 13:58:56
And if posting to the blockchain is that rare, it will become expensive, giving plenty of fees to miners. So miners, and thus the security of bitcoin, will survive just fine. Once payment channels are widely adopted (im predicting 3 years), "settling up" on the block chain will not be necessary for every transaction. IE everyone who wants to run a node on a raspberry pi-level piece of hardware, or a smartphone, a satelite etc doesn't have to store every $5 latte purchase made with bitcoin for eternity. Smoke on that.
@_date: 2015-05-26 07:13:17
Good point, quality is important. But I'm imagining a sort of "youtube of streamiums". If we assume we're streaming "pre-cached" videos stored "in the cloud" basically the quality level can have a chance. If a server only had to pay its ISP on a per-bandwidth basis, it could succeed economically by opportunistically downloading content that will be "in demand" later. The more content it develops the larger a library it can offer in exchange for revenue. As long as Revenue &gt; Upload + Download costs, the server makes a profit.

Your 'artificial limit' is everyone else's upload and download bandwidth. It's a reasonable trade-off to keep Bitcoin decentralized.
@_date: 2015-05-31 06:09:55
Well, with off-blockchain transaction clearing techniques like 3-rd party ledgers (ie changetip, coinbase etc) or payment channels, 2,000 bitcoin transactions could clear many more actual transactions. I'm comfortable with treating blocksize as a precious resource and seeing what can happen when we conserve it. I don't think bitcoin's ledger should be expected to carry every transaction on the entire planet. If the network is opened up as a free, highly-available datastore for the entire internet to use, that's a bandwidth cost that every fully-validating node will have to carry, forever.
@_date: 2015-05-26 03:43:07
In general yes. Bandwidth will be an issue for most domestic streamers.
@_date: 2017-02-27 18:33:15
If OPEC can get a higher price for its oil then that's just a savvy business decision as far as I see it. I also don't see how that has anything to do with the blocksize debate except that it's another example of you mis-attributing responsibility onto anyone but yourself because of your own hubris: bitcoin OWES you a higher blocksize just as OPEC OWES you their oil.
If you think there's an artificial limit to Bitcoin, start an altcoin without that limit and see how much better it does. Oh wait there's been 100s.
@_date: 2017-02-27 18:20:00
How is it not a free market? Miners are free to pick which ever transactions they want to include. The blocksize limit is just basic rules of the road for everyone.
@_date: 2015-05-31 05:32:57
Exactly the point. Transaction fees will pay miners. Who will keep mining, thus keeping bitcoin's POW consensus alive, thus keeping bitcoin a viable system. After the blockreward is gone, the existence of transaction fees will be critical. If no one pays transaction fees, everyone will freeload off bitcoin. With no incentive to mine, the POW consensus could break down.
@_date: 2015-05-25 19:52:35
Yes it would be best if streams orginated from providers who can actually upload consistently. And if it were also attached to a system dedicated to curating and aquiring content, and a system for advertising that content online.

Bitcoin is money, and by definition the rich will inherently have the most money... 
Raising the blocksize = needing more storage = more expensive to run a node = restricting bitcoin's usage only to the rich.
@_date: 2015-05-12 13:32:57
You're missing a huge point: larger blocks will require more storage to fully validate. If we just keep the block size at 1 mb, in a few years, everyone with a smart phone will be able to run their own fully-validating node. How could we possibly ask for wider adoption than that?   Im not saying there isnt room for a small jump, say 2-4mb blocks, but a huge jump in bandwidth requirements will price the poorest users out of being able to afford a full node. How does that improve adoption?

It's likely now we are going to see more times when fees are non-optional. This should be fixed by wallets implementing good fee handling practices including RBF to fix stuck transactions. FWIW I've never had a problem with stuck transactions when using mycelium

Bruce please just stop. You seem like a really nice guy who wants the best for Bitcoin and I respect that. Your problem is that you are too nice and you want to believe that everyone can be right but that is simply impossible.
Bitcoin will get on just fine without your efforts doing whatever it is you think you're doing. You have demonstrated no ability to distinguish between people worth listening to and people not worth listening to. I recommend you take some time off from Bitcoin and relax, I'm sure you have other hobbies. Bitcoin's not going anywhere. In the mean time, other fools will arise and you may learn something from watching them. I doubt that though because you're already a grown-ass man who can't distinguish between people who've delivered quality bitcoin software time and again from clueless morons with control-freak complexes. Best of luck, and I truly mean it.

Is it really perfectly reasonable to assume that a small group of people are more likely to have a safe implementation of scaling bitcoin than 100+ core developers? I mean what is that viewpoint, really?
@_date: 2016-01-07 00:25:53
Everyone can always use bitcoin the same amount: as much as they can pay for. To me, that's the only *realistic* way to look at it and I don't think it's at all at odds of the entire point of bitcoin. Degrading the network by raising the blocksize limit risks damaging the integrity of bitcoin for every single user, large or small. It's a lazy approach to scaling. 
Edit: To be honest I'm not 100% against a small short term blocksize increase just to get this damn debate past us. I just think people need to be realistic: we cannot have every single 'microtransaction' (ie coffee level or lower) rebroadcast into every node. It's just.not.realistic. And I don't want us to just raise the limit every time we start getting somewhere "near" hitting it, and just assume that everyone's technology will keep up. Better solutions are necessary. My vision of bitcoin is to have people running full nodes off their cellphones, not data centers, with reliable "off-chain"/eventually confirming transactions. I think in the short term a switch to segwit @ 1mb would be an ok bump-up.

I strongly doubt any "vested interest" is actually doing either. I think both sides of the debate (but especially the big blockers tbh) are a bit too damn full of themselves and love to see conspiracies where there are none. This is compounded by the fact that the bitcoin space is full anti-government/anti-corporation types of people who really love conspiracy theories.
But if I'm going to indulge this game I'd pick A. Reduce bitcoin to a small amount of full nodes then it's more convenient to eavesdrop on them, identify all bitcoin users, track their habits, use that information to disrupt the community further then eventually swoop in and shutdown or co-opt all nodes, not necessarily at the same time.
On the other hand, even if I could bribe every single core developer to do what... purse the reasonable policy of capping an unscalable broadcast network so other solutions can be worked on and a fee market can develop? That's the mischevious plan? I'd probably be better off simply buying them off with large salaries to not work at bitcoin at all.
Yeah bitcoin is becoming more complicated... raising the "barrier to entry" as you put it. That's the nature of improvements. Should we make it simpler? Go back to having unencrypted wallets and berkeleyDB?
Look, you can throw shade on the dev's as much as you want but at the end of the day they are the best we've got and this is definitely a meritocracy. If you think you can do better, have at it. I don't necessarily trust any given core dev, but as a group yes I trust them to all watch each other.

"Bitcoin is drowning in a poor user experience and promises".
I find that hard to believe. The fee market is a free market, people are free to use or not use bitcoin as they see fit. As the price of bitcoin rises, it's natural that the $ value of satoshis needed to transact on the bitcoin network would rise. If you truly think that's going to happen why don't you just buy and hold so you profit off it?
@_date: 2015-05-31 03:55:11
People who want to increase the blocksize worry too much about making bitcoin the "perfect frictionless money" in an idealized future with mass adoption (even 0.1% of humanity would be MASSIVE), without realizing that doing so would basically require every full node to become an enormous data farm. All in the name of "saving people transaction fees." 
@_date: 2016-01-06 21:38:09

Well we do have viable off-chain solutions, they just aren't trustless yet. That's what lightning network will solve. And the theory behind that is solid as far as I can tell. Therefore it will eventually work.
I understand that you think bitcoin-the-network should be cheap to use in terms of fees. But I also think bitcoin-the-program should be cheap to *run* in terms of bandwidth consumption. I don't think it's worth it to ghettoize people into SPV wallets.

Again, fees are what will--in time--secure the entire network. Fees MUST go up. A bitcoin without fees will die from no block reward. Then it doesn't help the first or third worlds. But with a small blocksize, at least the 3rd world can participate as first class citizens.
Also, I imagine that a lot of international transactions won't need instant inclusion in a block. I'm pretty sure that transactions increase in priority the longer they sit in the mempool, so again, transactions should confirm eventually.
@_date: 2015-08-16 13:18:19
I've seen the mempool where it is now and I've seen it at 70+mb. I don't see any major fee pressure or slowdown happening at all. I'd be psyched if I were because it would mean bitcoin was so popular it was bursting at the seams but it simply isn't happening. That's what makes XT a solution in search of a problem.
@_date: 2015-08-16 13:24:05
In the future your pizza-level transactions will be handled semi-off chain through payment channels that only pay a fee once fully concluded. Lets give this type of solution a chance to develop before we make a choice to raise the blocksize that we can never reverse.

I'm in favor of keeping the 1mb limit around for a while. I think this will keep full node-ship a viable option for people who don't even know they need it yet.
@_date: 2015-08-15 13:33:33
Or maybe locations where only cellular internet is available, as is common in the 3rd world. Imagine being able to run a full node off a cellular data plan paid in bitcoin. Running a full node effectively makes you a first class citizen on the network. Once the next generation of cellular capabilities are deployed in the next 2-5 years, I think running a full node at 1mb/block will become affordable worldwide and trivial in the first world. To me that's the core benefit of 1mb/block: it gives bitcoin a chance to become accessible to the world's poorest regions, areas where they don't even know they need it yet.
@_date: 2015-08-16 13:09:08

@_date: 2015-08-16 11:59:01
It will eventually force large blocks on anyone who wants to run XT. I really see this as a solution in search of a problem and if it isn't broke I don't think we should fix it. Things are working fine with 1mb. Most of the time there is no fee pressure. Even when there is fee pressure, small or no-fee transactions should confirm *eventually*. Why can't we wait 1 more year for alternatives to develop?
@_date: 2015-08-03 00:05:00
But wait, I thought raising the blocksize was to reduce/eliminate fees. And how can we be sure "unsustainable free transactions" will be ignored?

People don't include a fixed fee altruistically, they include one to bid on rapid inclusion in limited block-size. Therefore total fees are based on value of inclusion in a block. You can say that a less limited blocksize will have more transactions and thus the same fees or more fees, but I think that's making an unproven assumption about the elasticity of fees.
@_date: 2015-08-02 23:31:37
The branch with larger blocks will have less utility because it will cost more to run a full node. Fewer people will run a full node, hence less network effect. Miners will get less fees and be less incentivized to secure it.

@_date: 2015-08-02 23:28:52
"CONCLUSION: Do everything possible to enhance the value and usability of the Bitcoin network now, including keeping transactions costs to an absolute minimum for as long as humanly possible."
There is no free lunch. Raising the blocksize to keep transaction costs low is like (poor metaphor) putting a windmill on your car to generate electricity while driving. Yes, the people getting to use that electricity benefit from it (people who send a high # of small value, low-priority transactions from spv-like clients benefit the most from no fees), but the car will use extra gas because of wind resistance. (everyone running a fully-validating node will need more bandwidth) To me it's as simple as that, and I (respectfully) still don't see the point of shoving exponential bandwith requirements down the throat of those who want to be 100% secure and private by running a full node, just so some other people don't have to pay a tiny fee that goes to the miners, who fundamentally are the only ones actually securing the network.
@_date: 2015-08-16 12:18:00
If the limit was 8mb now, there would probably be people demanding a 64mb block. People always want more; it's human nature. We can always build a bigger engine but making system that's small, precise and has exactly what it needs is tough.
You say that keeping the limit at 1mb is a choice to limit bitcoin's growth. I don't agree. The limit does not destroy anyone's ability to use bitcoin, it just requires a fee sometimes for timely inclusion in the blockchain. This fee goes to the miners who contribute 100% of the proof of work which is what makes bitcoin secure in the first place. If we keep raising the limit every time we experience any fee pressure, eventually there will be block reward at all. (though of course this will take over 100years). If there is no block reward, the miners will not be able to mine and bitcoin will die.
@_date: 2015-08-12 22:40:48
So lets give developers a chance to improve wallets yo fix these issues. There's no rush to jump to an xt chain. We can always throw more resources at tge problem its not a creative solution. Whats the rush to sacrifice the predictability of 1mb?

It's not about having more full nodes simply for the sake of having more full nodes. It's so that everyone who wants to run a full node will be able to afford to do so.
Edited in:
It's so that we can set up bitcoin to be 100% freely available to everyone to run a full node if they so choose. If we can set up systems to broadcast a 1mb block across all spectrums so bitcoin is trivially affordable for any hardware to run full node for the foreseeable future, then we've won. If, once that is accomplished, then the community agrees there is unreasonable fee pressure, raising the blocksize will be trivially easy and non controversial. I really don't see that right now. As I type this, the whole mempool is 212 kb according to  The idea that transaction fees are in any way blocking bitcoin from taking off is what is what appears backwards to me.
@_date: 2015-08-16 12:22:37
What benefit does anyone derive from running a full node? So in an XT world we're ok with making a full node permanently cost prohibitive to people below a certain socio-economic status and consigning them forever SPV status?
@_date: 2015-07-05 16:20:59
Yes. And it could probably be fooled by proxies.
@_date: 2015-08-16 12:52:43
I don't see us reaching the limit at all. Even when the mempool was 70+mb I had no major issues using bitcoin at all, I just included a tiny extra bit of fee as a courtesy that was probably unnecessary anyways. 
Edit: and what is *the limit* anyways? In a situation where more than 1mb/10 min was actually being generated in real usage, maybe then I would consider raising the blocksize. But I also believe that if we were approaching that situation things would self-stabilze a bit as people found more creative ways to use that 1mb of blocksize.
@_date: 2015-08-16 12:46:10

Well 0-conf *is* inherently 'less secure' by design, regardless of how it's actually used. That's obviously been my bottom line since the start of this discussion. 
If the customer is acting in good faith, then obviously 0-conf is perfectly fine. If the customer is acting in bad faith then a double-spend attack is possible if the merchant does not wait for at confirm(s). This confirmless-double spend attack is possible in a world with or without RBF. I'm not trying to judge anyone a moron, I'm just stating facts as I see them. Flagging a transaction RBF admits the pre-existing reality of the 'fluidness' of unconfirmed tx's as well as miner's incentives include transactions with highest fees and uses it to improve functionality.
Look I'm not excited to wait 10 minutes for a confirm either. It sucks and it's certainly an important area for improvement. Obviously RBF is not a solution to making unconfirmed *more* secure. That will take other projects/services/LN/whatever/etc. But in my view it adds functionality in a way that aligns with the incentives of the rest of the bitcoin system.


Great so let's have RBF for when that happens.

0 conf always has been and will be insecure. Bitcoin doesn't owe it to businesses that remain lazy about security to not improve its handling of transactions. If a business wants to use 0conf, RBF or no, they take on risk in the name improving convenience.
It's telling that your're so concerned about RBF being included in core. Say, RBF wasn't included in core. What's to stop miners from implementing a "de facto" RBF policy on the fly? After-all it's in their economic best interest to include the replacement transaction with a higher fee.
0 conf transactions always have been and always will be insecure (to the extent the receiver doesn't trust the sender not to try to double spend). RBF is the most rational way of handling them. Implementing it in a clear and standardized way so everyone can understand it is what's best for everyone. If there was a secure way to send bitcoin without including it in blocks then why would we bother having blocks?

Here's my attempt to explain it: Segwit eliminates all known forms of malleability. This is important because a LN channel is kind of like a transaction that that gets made, but then edited many times between the two parties before finally settling on the chain. Without a fix to malleability, an attacker can likely 'dos' the network by sending a 'malleated' version of the LN channel after it's initialized, thus confusing the participants. A clever hacker might even be able to trick someone into sending him funds. I think consensus is that it's simpler to fix malleability once-and-for-all first, then deploy LN than it is to program LN to be malleabilty-aware forever.
This is just my non-developer-level understanding.

Since bitcoin&lt;&gt;altcoin trade is generally quite liquid (probably) I don't see why people wouldn't want to create their own promotional currencies. I'm not saying they will be seriously viable, more like earning points on a credit card or something.

There's not that much pressure to deploy a LN type solution today because we still aren't filing up 1mb blocks. So there's no pressure to compact transactions. Thus LN has nothing to offer against what is already basically a zero-fee environment. But once an LN-transfer beats an on-blockchain transfer in fees, then we will all be using the LN network which costs us nothing in privacy or durability of the core protocol but gives us all the same control of our bitcoin. LN hubs can be organized structures that operate on top of the bitcoin protocol. No one has to download all LN data of all LN hubs (equivalent to having large blocks and just jamming all that data directly into the blockchain) so the bitcoin network remains robust.

"Layer 2" type solutions are the real long term solution in my opinion. From a design perspective they make sense: everyone is allowed to choose whichever layer 2 solution they want to use. Every "Layer 2 Solution" will allow off-chain transactions in some way, whether it's database transfers (changetip2changetip, coinbase2coinbase) or trustless transfers through multisig schemes (lightning network, micropayments). Obviously database transfers are magnitudes less costly than bitcoin transactions in terms of CPU, memory and IO which makes them inherently cheaper and gives entities like VISA a huge advantage in trxns/sec.
Different Layer 2 Solutions will be geared towards different purposes. Changetip, a very early example still relevant today, allows us to send btc over reddit. Coinbase provides a fiat&lt;&gt;coin gateway service. Gyft, coffee.foldapp, Purse.io etc all provide coin&lt;&gt;goods &amp; services gateways.
Bitcoin does not exist so it can store every $4.55 starbucks purchase in the blockchain forever. It exists to be the rock of truth so trustworthy applications can build upon it.

Three points:
1. This device seems like it's still a prototype and I imagine it will get miniaturized in the future. I'm picturing a future version of this able to run over GSM (or something similar, provided blocks are still small enough in the future for this to be feasible).
2. The repeated emphasis on 'satoshis' suggests to me that this will be a colored-coins aware platform. I'm imagining it could be set up so that it unlocks a door for the person who owns one particular satoshi or something... The benefit to this is that as long as your security system is setup to recognize the owner of that satoshi as "authorized" then bitcoin provides a trustable way to transfer that authorization token between people. This could be big for those hotels that are trending towards automation... (yotel?)
3. I still don't see why this needs an ASIC mining chip.

Bitcoin's core value proposition has always been and will always remain the same: a provably fixed supply that is easy to validate completely. Other trustworthy layers can be built upon this. The relative lack of other such layers so far just means we're still in the early stages. Lets not throw the baby out with the bathwater here ramping up the blocksize exponentially before we even see a real sustained fee market develop.
@_date: 2015-11-16 23:04:25

I'm not concerned with miners, no offense to them but they are just capitalists who think that mining bitcoin is more profitable than buying bonds or whatever. I'm concerned with issues that could bring the network down for everyone. By poor I just mean less able to afford bandwidth. I believe the future of bitcoin is full node + Lightning network, not SPV which is essentially dialing into someone else's full node. If we keep raising the costs of running a full node, many people are going to be stuck on SPV forever, depending on a steady or shrinking amount of full nodes. 
Also lets remember that validating a block takes significant time even on a modern CPU. If we start raising it too quickly, it might become too computationally difficult to verify a block within 10 minutes.

If the mempool is more than 1mb, its likely the block will be "full". Right now the mempool is aroind 13mb. During the stress test it was over 1,100mb but bitcoin still operated mostly ok. So now that I've explained this to you, will you please stop presenting the data in a misleading way?

If you're sending from a hosted wallet like circle they might not give you a choice on what fee to use, so just dont worry about it. That's how coinbase is. If youre sending from youre own personal wallet you can pick your own fee but going with the recommended fee is usually fine, thats how mycelium works.

No layer 2 solutions are working? I guess changetip doesnt count. Neither do direct transfers via coinbase. Re-assigning bitcoins to different accounts to clear trades on exchanges is also impossible and has never happened. Localbitcoin sales have also never transferred bitcoin from one account to another offchain.
I guess you're right, we don't have a single trusted layer on top of bitcoin. Guess we should raise blocksize and expect future hardware to bail us out of the exponentially rising bandwidth requirements. It's only dangerous to hope the future will develop layer 2 solutions like changetip, expecting everyone's bandwidth to keep rising for free is just common sense.

 says 2 mb. My own node says 74 mb. Still I've seen it go up to 1.1GB on tradeblock.com, and bitcoin has survived.
Changetip etc do scale bitcoin. Yes they are 'centralized' but anyone can decide whether or not to use them or to just use the blockchain directly, this keeps them honest. LN is just a much more advanced version of the same concepts integrated directly with the blockchain. Centralization creates efficiencies that can scale bitcoin. I don't see how raising the blocksize can fix the problem, it will most likely lead to centralization in the worst way: node depopulation. I say keep blocksize small, keep nodes cheap to run and let scaling happen on top of that network. Different scaling solutions will succeed or fail on top of it, but the network itself will fundamentally continue to work.

At this point its total guesswork.
@_date: 2015-11-05 15:30:52
Ok. Go here.  Look where it says total size. This is the amount of transactions eaiting to be confirmed. Right now its under 7mb. That means that when a miner has a new block, they have rougjly 7mb worth of transactions to fill it with. So they pick the best 1mb worth of transactions, probably those with highest fees. During the stress tests, this number rose to more than 1,100 mb yet life went on just fine. So you see, current nodes are no where near their limits.
@_date: 2015-10-01 14:32:43


I wouldn't mind a small increase to 2mb if the mempool was so overflowing that we clearly needed one to rebalance the network. But I'm 100% against any pre-emptive blocksize raise.


No one's asking you to move to a LN hub right away. I'm just saying lets give LN time to mature or not before we raise the blocksize.
@_date: 2015-11-05 15:55:45
Maybe for smaller transactions, just pay a smaller fee and accept a small wait time? Or bundle them together as multiple outputs of the same transaction, which is something clients of the future will be able to do im sure. Or in the future send it through the lightning network.
Edit: And as for centralization, that IS a real concern that has the potential to bring down the entire network which is a much bigger danger in my mind than having to pay 10 cents/ transaction.
@_date: 2015-10-01 12:19:44


I didn't mean to imply we could *only* send LN transfers. We'll always have a choice, but eventually LN will be significantly cheaper. LN transfers put no burden on fully validating nodes, therefore add no burden to the system requiring only a tiny system-fee. 
Yes I expect there will be growing pains with the LN network. But the theory behind it seems sound to me so I'm sure it can develop into something concrete, just as bitcoin was once unproven. And, look, we're still a LONG ways off from needing anything like the LN network. We aren't even close to filling up 1mb consistently. I'm not saying we shouldn't worry about the future, but lets not throw out the baby with the bathwater. Raising the blocksize means every fully-validating node has to pull more data from every other fully validating node, massively increasing network requirements which pushes the most resource-poor (cpu, bandwidth, harddrive) nodes off the network.
Keeping the blocksize small means bitcoin remains a robust network that anyone can dial into, and people are free to try different scaling solutions on top of it. If any of those scaling solutions fail it can't take down the whole network for everyone. If we try to make bitcoin scale in the wrong way and it takes down the whole network then that's bad for everyone. Raising the blocksize is essentially trivial and we can always do it later if more sophisticated options fail. Hardware and bandwidth will always get cheaper. Can we give LN, the fee market, and other "Layer 2 Solutions" a chance before we turn the blockchain into a spam free-for-all?


This reminds me of the people (don't see them around much any more) who used to say bitcoin would fail because of deflation. Your logic: too many people using bitcoin will make the fees too high for more people to use bitcoin. I think at that point bitcoin will be doing just fine. I mean, really, I'm not a republican but when it comes to bitcoin I say let it be used by the people who are willing to pay to use it as first class citizens. Low-fee and 0 fee transactions still get confirmed by the network -- eventually. And once fees are high, people will need to hold bitcoin in order to pay the fees, good for price!

@_date: 2015-11-16 23:02:35
No. 1 MB is fine for now. I like 1mb. It's predictable. There will be other layers built on top of bitcoin that will help us scale. Those layers will have the cost savings of centralization but will not raise the cost of running a node. Once I see us actually running up against 1mb over and over again for a long time I might change my mind. Right now the mempool size is less than 2mb.

Welcome to the world of bitcoin. Here are some tried and true services that I recommend:
Coinbase.com: You can either sell your bitcoin directly to coinbase or use their exchange to sell it at market price to another trader. Generally the first option will be what you need.

Fair enough, I kind of conflated a double spend and a 51% attack. I think the point i intended to make is that btc has great hassle to security ratio. Say youre recieving a large transaction(whatever "large" means to "you"), you only need to wait a short time to make sure its confirmed. Sure its possible to do similarly with credit cards. You just have to already be set up to swipe cards which is much more onerous than generating a btc addr i imagine... so of course its "apples and oranges"

The ask sum is the total amount of BTC on the orderbook at any price. The bid sum is total amount of $ on the order book at any price. The bid sum/ask sum is what the exchange rate would be if the entire bid sum were traded for the entire ask sum. Sometimes the bid sum/ask sum can be an indicator of where the price may be going... though obviously it's not perfect, no indicator is.
A low ask sum suggests that there are very few coins currently for sale and that competition for these remaining coins may be fierce, ie driving up price. On the other hand, this increase in price will likely attract many new sellers of bitcoin who will send their coins to Gox and push the ask sum back up so I don't expect this low ask sum to be permanent.

For my money, this seems like a pretty good improvement. First of all, it I don't see how it adds anything that isn't completely optional, so if you don't want to use this new feature, you're completely free to ignore it and it won't impact your usage of bitcoin at all, even at the level of downloading additional data in the blockchain because AFAIK, there is no reason to store the PaymentRequests or PaymentAcks in the blockchain. 
But if you do use it, it will remove a possible vector of exploitation called a man in the middle or MITM/mitm attack. Here's how a MITM attack would work: say bob wants to buy widgets from alice, they agree on a price and alice sends her address to bob. But in transit, the address is intercepted and re-written by eve into an address controlled by eve. Bob then unwittingly sends the payment to eve's address. With version 0.9, there should be an easy, standardized way for bob to receive alice's address, signed by alice, so he knows for sure that he and alice will not be victim of an mitm attack. Personally, I think this is a great improvement, though I grant that this kind of attack does seem pretty rare. 
Regarding the use of X.509, I think this is a good decision because it will allow bitcoin to piggy-back on a huge already-existing network of certificates instead of having to re-invent the wheel. Since bitcoin is open source, if you don't want to use X.509 you are free fork the code and use your own certificate network. If you don't trust X.509 you're free to seek alternative ways of validating addresses.

Exactly. This is why for 99 out of 100 (or better) people it's better to just buy and hold than try to get into the mining game. If you want to mine, you're probably a btc believer anyways so buying and holding is a reasonable investment for you. Even if you buy the best mining tech today, avoiding delays/failures/whatever, you're still going to be competing against an ever-expanding hashrate for an ever-decreasing trickle of new btc.

Great point. I think that the phenomenon we are seeing right now of asic sales is going to be temporary.  The consumer market is simply going to get priced out of mining all together. Long term efficency will only be possible in places with cheap electricity/cooling. Unless it remains permanently a technology war between companies producing ever smaller asics.
I think that right now btc is in the middle of a transitionary phase. Up to recently, it's been possible for the average user to put together a few modern gpus to make a decent rig. I doubt most of those rigs will ever recoup their investment unless they were very early. They certainly haven't been able get much since asics started coming online in 2013.  Today you need asics to even have a chance of recouping your investment in btc terms. The bulk of the remaining unmined bitcoins will flow through the hands of asic owners. They might go from there to dividends, purchases or sales for dollars. Even if they do put them on the market for dollars, only so many are getting mined. My point is twofold. 1. Can bitcoin survive the centralization of asics? I say yes because so much is already distributed. 2. Will it have an impact when people realize that the remaining btc are already being fought over by centralized mining companies so the only realistic way for the average person to get btc would be to buy it or trade for it or buy a mining contract? We'll see.

Well, if that many people start using it, since it's optional, it'll be because it works and is worth using. I think something like this is necessary in the long run to completely eliminate the possibility of mitm attacks (or at least one particularly nasty vector for them) and will make bitcoin more robust. By integrating it into the default client (not the protocol, you're always free to use non-reference clients), it will make this security available to EVERYONE ie non power-users, not just those who seek out third parties or  implement similar systems on their own, independently. 
No offense, but I think you're making yourself worried about nothing. Relax :)

Well, to be honest I think it has more to do with proliferation of exchanges than ASICS, ie people have more options to put their coins on sale at other exchanges so fewer coins go on sale at GOX. 
As far as mining goes, I think the block reward is a bigger factor than ASIC vs GPU mining. In about 3 years from now 75% of all bitcoin that's ever going to be created will be mined. More and more new people chasing a smaller and smaller stream of new bitcoins...

Fair enough, I just dont think the price is high enough yet to make this a priority.

It's been higher than it is now and I expect it to get back there soon. This kind of price action in the late week / early weekend is very bullish. IMO, this time is usually the bearish part of the weekly cycle, it tends to go up most on monday/tuesday/wednesday as new money gets transferred into the exchanges and go down on thursday/friday/the weekend as less money is flowing into the exchanges. The recent price action suggests that major players are scooping up now, over-riding this cycle. I expect continued bullish action early this week as bank transfers flow into the exchanges again. 
I also think that bitcoin's deflationary nature is about to kick in once people realize how less than 50% of bitcoins remain to be mined and once the block reward halves again in 3 short years, it'll only be 25%. These remaining bitcoin will take a LONG time to get mined, even with ever-increasing hashing power.

I don't think is really as big a deal as people make it out to be... the fed is going to do what the fed is going to do regardless of who is the figurehead.

Yes, move to .7 and continue.

When did depositors suddenly become shareholders?

I recommend you hang in there with coinbase. It's a drag to get your bank acct verified but once it is verified you can place orders where the price will be locked in thkugh you have to wait for your coins. Still it's my preferred provider of coin.

Thank you!

I've used it before and I can confirm that it works.

Why would I want to invest in a currency with "demurrage"?

It's worth three and a half minutes to learn about it.
@_date: 2013-01-09 01:53:45
It seems pretty well thought-out to me.
@_date: 2013-06-10 01:41:49
Good thinking.
