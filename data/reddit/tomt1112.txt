High fees have not driven instant segwit adoption.  Fees will help drive lightning, but it won't be fast enough, it's an intermediate term solution.
The short-term, stop gap solution is to raise the block size cap a reasonable amount to stop the bleeding.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:08:01
Fees are high because of full blocks, which only started happening in the last year.  WHEN lightning is ready it won't be immediately adopted and then lightning channels still have to be closed and written to the Bitcoin block chain, incurring high fees.  Lightning is a long term solution along with segwit.
To avoid more forks and high fees we need a short term solution.  I think the only viable option is to raise the block cap to 2mb - 4mb.  This would be a great stop gap until lightning is truly ready and adopted.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:10:49
I agree, we need an immediate block size increase as the short term solution.  It's been we tested with other cryptocurrencies and it will stop the insanity.
Long term we can rely on segwit and lightning adoption, but we can't wait...
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:54:40
When do you expect segwit adoption to take off?  It has not yet... We need an immediate solution in the interim, before lightning and segwit are fully adopted.
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:25:58
They absorb the cost of fees per transaction, which are high because of the block size limited to 1mb.  I think it is reasonable to have a minimum so people don't use them as a general purpose wallet.  
 I'm sure this is the result of people abusing the 30 free transactions.  I would rather they add a minimum than raise other fees.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:43:57
We only started hitting the block size limit in the last year and we've seen the consequences.   Lighting and segwit adoption are intermediate solutions, we need a stop-gap short term solution.
Raising the block size to 2 or 4 mb is a very viable.  It will also help avoid further coin forks / fragmentation.  It will be good enough and give breathing room for segwit and lightning adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:50:36
Exactly people have not adopted segwit, even if the wallets do have it it's still now widely used.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:58:43
At the time of 2x fees were manageable, now they are out of control.  It's okay to adjust one's position on this.

No, as soon as it is in USD then it's income.  Even if you turn around and buy btc again.  
*I didn't move any money out of the exchange, I just bought back in. What about then?
Yes. A tax event occurred and you gained money, even though it isn't in your bank account. For tax purposes it is treated no differently.*
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:43:46
Short term is defined as one year or less.   Profit is then taxed as ordinary income, so whatever your specific tax rate is, which is up to 39%... ( Probably less)
Whatever you do with your new money is inconsequential.   You don't pay income tax twice.  As it is no different than money earned through normal work.  If you reinvest then you would only pay tax on any new profits.

No, I'm talking about a Bitcoin core consensus change.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:22:15
Segwit and lightning are great long term solutions but Bitcoin is bleeding from fees!  - the viable short term solution is to raise the block size cap to the 2-4mb range.
If we don't there will be more forks/ fragmentation and loss of confidence.  This is TRIAGE until lightning/segwit take off.

@_date: 2017-12-21 01:18:57
I think this statement is very fair.  Bitcoin should also consider raising the block size cap as a short term solution to 2mb - 4mb.  This will help avoid high fees, unconfirmed transactions and fragmentation through further forks.  When we have lightning channels will still have to be closed and written to the blockchain, incurring fees.
There is no shame in doing this, and it's a totally viable solution until the promise of segwit and lightning are fully adopted.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:04:12
These are intermediate solutions that will take months to years for adoption.  We need an immediate triage solution to stop the bleeding.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:52:59
We need a short term solution to stop the bleeding.  Increasing the block cap to 2-4mb would settle things down, effectively triage until lightning is ready and adopted.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:12:10
It's not a hacky solution, it's simply raising an artificial limit.  
Do you have any evidence to support the bandwidth claim?  We're talking about 2-4mb per block compressed smaller and distributed every 10 mins.  The average web page is 1mb!
As for why it is needed right now, we've seen an exponential increase in transaction fees which is undermining confidence in Bitcoin and it's ability to function as an efficient means of money.  We can't wait for segwit and lightning adoption.

If you sell you might have to pay capital gains tax in the US.  If you bought recently this could be short term capital gains tax which can be as high as 39% on the profit, depending on your other income.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:55:25
No, fees will stay high since lightning and segwit are intermediate term solutions.  We need a SHORT term fix until they are ready.
The viable short term fix is to raise the block cap to 2mb or 4mb.  This will tide us over until lightning is ready.

We need a short term solution until lightning and segwit are fully adopted.   
This solution needs to come quickly to avoid further high fees, forks and general congestion that has crippled Bitcoin.
Raising the block cap to 2mb or 4mb is a very viable short term, stop-gap measure until we can realize the more scalable off chain solutions like lightning.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:34:17
2-4mb blocks won't need to be undone, they're a safe and benign solution that other cryptos have tested.  Hard drive sizes have grown substantially, so the extra storage won't cause issue.
The adoption curve of segwit is exactly why we can't 'hope and prey' for lightning to solve our problems.  It will take a long time for lightning to be adopted, just like segwit. 
Bitcoin is changing, since we never had full blocks until this last year.  What's the downside to some reasonable triage?  It will make blocks function more like they used to.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:17:05
Do you expect lightning to be adopted overnight? If not then.how quickly?
 I'm all for Bitcoin and I hate forks/ fragmentation but right now we need a stop gap solution, something tried and true.  Raising the block size cap 2-4mb is totally viable as triage.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:13:24
Agreed, we need a viable solution for right now.   A reasonable block size increase is fully compatible and complimentary to future off chain solutions.
Long term we can hope for lightning, but right now we need 2-4mb block cap.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:02:41
Having 2-4mb blocks does not cause centralization.  It's also well tested.  
 It's time to do something right now to buy time for segwit and lightning adoption in the future.

Nah, he would just say we need to raise the block size cap to 4mb as a short term solution, until lightning is ready and adopted.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:52:35
This is just as SILLY as keeping the block size cap at 1mb while fees skyrocket!
Lightning and segwit adoption are not strong enough yet.  Raising the block size cap to 2 - 4mb is the needed short term solution.
It will allow bitcoin to continue to grow, avoid forks and buy time for segwit / lightning adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:09:09
Lightning won't come quick enough.  We need a short term stop gap solution to stop the bleeding.  The answer is still to raise the block size to 2-4mb. 
This won't be the long term fix, but it's the triage we need right now.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:26:13
Lightning will be great for point of sale (credit card) style transactions.  Unfortunately this is not the type of transaction that is causing massive fees right now.
We need to fix this (short term) by increasing the block size to 2-4mb as soon as possible so future tech can be developed and adopted.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:06:43
This is not true at all. The network is only capped by the cutrent limited block size.
@_date: 2018-09-02 14:02:58
I'm wondering that as well,. What's the average lightning volume in dollars per hour?
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:58:47
Until recently Bitcoin never had full blocks and as such fees were low.  Now we've reached the 1mb limit, so it's Bitcoin that has CHANGED in form leading to high costs.
I'm a Bitcoin supporter, not Bitcoin Cash. Storage is cheap these days, there is really no excuse not to raise the block size limit a reasonable amount to help aid continued adoption.  
Let's be honest lightning is not here yet and even then closing channels leads to fees.  Letting fees get this high only hurts adoption and leads to brand dilution through forks.
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:02:51
Yes, I think it is crazy $10 is a lot of money in some parts of the world.  This is something Bitcoin needs to address in the short term or there will be more forks and fragmentation.  We can't wait for segwit or lightning adoption to fix this, those are intermediate solutions.  
I believe the most viable short term solution is to raise the block size limit to 2 or 4mb.  This will lower but not eliminate fees and be good enough until lightning.
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:12:12
The block chain is full. You may wonder how it is possible for what is essentially a series of files to be “full”. The answer is that an entirely artificial capacity cap of one megabyte per block, put in place as a temporary kludge a long time ago, has not been removed and as a result the network’s capacity is now almost completely exhausted.
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:55:19
We only get spam if fees are near zero. I think it would be beneficial to adopt 2mb as a stop gap solution until lightning is ready.  This will also make it cheaper to close lightning channels which write to the block chain.   I don't support hard forks like bcash as this has diluted the Bitcoin brand and focus.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:57:28
No, fees have been inflated by an temporary cap that was supposed to be removed or changed many years ago.  This is artificially causing fees to skyrocket.   
We need to raise the blocks size to 2-4mb as a short term solution until longer term segwit / lightning are fully adopted.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:08:21
This is simply not true at all.  If there were reasonably larger blocks then people would not be forced to pay absurd fees to make sure they're transactions go through.

I had to wait over 1 week for verification on gemini.  I suspect all US regulated exchanges are inundated, which is awesome.!
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:10:45
I've recently switched to gemini, for the following reasons:
* Instant bank verification (at least with my big bank)
* free ach (500 per day) or wire
* Instantly available to buy btc, eth, etc
* Tight spread 
* Works in Minnesota (gdax does not)
* A reasonable number of free withdrawals
* Well backed
If you can't use gdax then buying bitcoin on coinbase has a huge spread, which is effectively​ a massive fee.  I was paying this, plus 14.95 fee for a $1000 btc buy, plus it was about $150 per btc above index price. 
It did take a week before gemini verified my account, due to backlog .... which is a good sign for them &amp; bitcoin!  Not sure if there are any negatives to gemini as I've recently switched, but I'd like to hear if there are.

@_date: 2017-11-16 03:09:05
What's interesting is that this math assumes lost bitcoins still have value. If 25% have been lost and are unrecoverable, then I don't think they have value and I expect btc market price already reflects this.
 Lost coins lower the current market cap and the 16T estimate for 1 million per coin.   On the flip side, we're also still mining up to 21 million total bitcoins total by 2033.  Also consider most new mined coins won't be lost.
Interesting to think about.
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:33:32
This makes sense to me, I don't think Wall Street can manipulate the price downwards without first buying bitcoin, which would drive the price higher. 
A long time owner of Bitcoin could short the futures, then sell their Bitcoin having effectively locked in a price.  We shall see if this plays out, hopefully the cost premium of the short is high enough to deter this?
