Also, If I send it to email. can I put it in an ewallet or how does that work. I'm new obviously.

Exactly. Some young staffer, somewhere along the line said, "hey look there is this currency that is anti-regulation by nature, and rolling it into your campaign would not only bolster your libertarian cred, but it would make you seem hip with the yung'uns."
It's a fucking political move. Simple.

Ever since I started reading about bitcoin, a general rule has been, don't use bitcoin as a way to buy and sell other currencies. So in essence, down voting my comment is members saying, we will whore our principles for a little bit of publicity.

"To follow the rules, Paul's campaign will have to convert any bitcoins back to dollars before they use them. But they'd do that anyway."
So it is, honest to god, a ploy.

Doesn't hurt that the US government now holds a metric shit ton of bitcoin after seizing the silk road.

Somehow I knew they wouldn't understand.

More business for Bitcoin.

This made me want to buy more bitcoin.

I hope there is an insurance company that accepts bitcoin.
