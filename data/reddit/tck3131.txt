For me it’s more a “what if I remembered they were on my personal machine and not my work one” because at the point $20 had become $80,000 ($400 per BTC) those bitches would be goooonnnnee.

I bought $20 worth in 2010 when it was $0.10.
I left that job and my bitcoin on a wallet on my work machine.
I hate myself quite frequently.

Yeah, it hurt when I got back into Crypto in 2013 during the first $1000 bubble.
I made a shit ton buying and selling, as at the time, it was difficult as balls for anyone in the UK to do so.
I would have definitely sold by the time they got to $3-400, don’t think I’m trying to say I’d be a millionaire if I still had access. If they just turned up tomorrow, though, obviously life-changing.

Bitcoub is what the confefe call it. He knows...

GBP is more expensive to buy BTC in if you want it quickly.
It's just a fact.
If you end up selling it back on the same site, and that same additional margin is there, it's no problem.
US$PPP doesn't apply in Fiat, why would it apply in BTC?

You do realise if he was born sooner, it would compound the problem....he'd have to wait longer to not be a minor.

I would define "sooner" as closer to now, but I can see how confusion would occur

Coinbase...account opened, verified and purchase made within 5 minutes of me opening the site.

My favourite post:
"Yes. Bitcoin could be a scam. I do not know a whole lot about Bitcoin, but there is always a chance something new is a scam. "

More like GBP-&gt;USD-&gt;BTC-&gt;BTC, but yes lol

Who says Facebook becomes "nearly worthless" before Bitcoin does?
I'm all for decentralized online currency, I just don't necessarily believe the first real viable option will be the one to live on forever.

Except you used it in the way you wanted it to be used...Mr Ego

Is that all? That surprises me. With 11M (nearly 12M) bitcoin around, I would've thought there'd be more than 21M addresses used.

They offer to validate your account using online banking, rather than the usual 2 deposits, wait and verify process.
It took 40-60 seconds, then was ready to purchase right away.

From what I remember, you choose this option, it then asks for your account details, then gives you the option to choose your verification method.
I'm not sure if it offers you the option with all Banks, but this was with Suntrust Bank

Billions of dollars worth? There's only $4billion been mined so far, and I don't think the Chinese have over 50% of them...yet

Good luck. Been almost 3 weeks for me and not heard anything from Gox on verification.
I'd consider a second option.
