Those are the first two things in the post.  AT BEST they're half truth.  AT BEST.

Bitcoin is getting an upgrade called Segwit2x.  Some people think that making the blocksize 2mb instead of 1mb will cause the world to end.  These people are just... wrong.  The block sized should have increased years ago and it's really sad that some people won't let it go.
The majority of users, business, and miners will be using Segwit2x.  There's a very loud minority that controls this forum that opposes it. It's really strange to watch.  The minority of people that support staying at 1mb are even trying to get the government involved to stop it. Which is the exact opposite of the point of bitcoin.
TLDR: Bitcoin needs to grow, those that oppose it are going to be left behind.

Yes, people are scared of the 2x change, for various reasons, so they're lashing out at everyone else.

Bitcoin is getting an upgrade called Segwit2x.  This upgrade adds two thigs: "Segwit" or "Segregated Witness" which is a technical upgrade to the protocol, and the 2nd part "2x" is doubling the size of the blocks so that it can hold more transactions.  The agreement was made that this would be done in two steps since activating Segwit doesn't require incompatible changes.
Since then the Segwit part has been implemented but now a lot of people are trying to back out of the "2x" part for.... reasons.  None of them particularly persuasive, some of them out right lies.  But the upgrade is going to go ahead as planned and these people are basically pitching a fit about it.

The vote for was for Segwit2x.  It passed.  It's implemented in two parts.  The first part got segwit.  The second part gets 2x.  It's was part of the same vote.  So for one it's happening regardless of what you want, and second most of the community will follow it because most people want it.
So stop lying.
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:48:57
Yes.  The people get to use the software that they believe is in their best interest.  That's how bitcoin works.  If you think 2x blocks aren't valid then don't accept them.

Not really, it's all pretty much paranoia.  I mean the 1mb limit had been in place for YEARS.  CPU power, storage, and bandwith have all gotten better.  There's no reason to keep it an artificially small limit.  Unless your plan is to force people to use your second layer scaling solution where you make money.
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:16:00

valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on
them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.

Of course nodes don't accept invalid blocks. The longest valid blockchain is bitcoin.  2x will be the longest chain.  It depends on the users to determine if they are "valid" or not.  Not you, not me, not core, not the miners, not anyone.  Everybody gets to act in their own best interest and that's what makes bitcoin works.
The 2x upgrade is long overdue and most people will accept these blocks as valid because they want it.
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:43:26
