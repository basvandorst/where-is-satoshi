And then when the last idiot bought it up (in bitcoin at 1200$) the price starts dropping hard because everybody who bought wants to make money in thw end or at least cut the loses....
Very same story in Bitcoin.... Most people want to have bitcoin because they think it will make them rich in the end... Sure the revolution btc brings is an extra but how much money you have matters the most in the Ende...

Well if the gold price wouldn't be determined by future massive manipulated markets I would agree. But since Gold market is the biggest manipulation seen I wouldn't be so curious about it currently.. It will go up and then dump like Bitcoin does.. 
This world became crazy.. Nobody is interested in any values all that counts is the rapid increase of the $$$ value of their accounts by taking the money at these manipulated markets from the regular dude investing in it... It doesnt matter what it is in the end..

Eligius is probably the best pool you can go to currently. You don't even have to reg. an account. Just use your BTC wallet address as username.
I would suggest BTCguild as a failover pool, just in case.
If you are really fancy you could join p2p which at the moment could lower your overall income a little bit due to the high variance.
But once p2p reaches over 5% I would highly suggest you to join p2p.

I understand what inflation is.
There are two different types of inflation. One which the media is talking about (how much the food prices and so on increase per month) and on the other hand real money inflation which comes from creating money out of thin air.
I don't understand what you are trying to say...
@_date: 2014-04-09 11:40:25
I totally agree.
Our whole FIAT system is simply not built to pay back all the debt it is creating. The whole Fiat is never meant to last for as long as it does. We are just keeping it somehow alive by printing more and more money to pay interests.
Just look at Greece. The whole system is so as bankrupt as it can be and they are just creating more debts to keep it alive and liquid. Everybody telling Greece will payback any of the debts some when is simply a lying politician or doesn't know anything about Currencies. Japan and the U.S. are doing the same by just printing the money they need to pay everything they can't with their current budget.
When the big $ crash accrues there will be a lot of panic. People with search for values which represent something.
Bitcoin is an great value because it's usable in our modern world, can't be printed by the modern Mafia (Governments) and so on.
Gold is also a great harbor to save values over the crises and most people will pump all their money in it.
When the dumb majority of people lost faith in the Fiat system strange things will happen. You can tell after the crises which decision was the right one not today.

No judge in this world could find any evidence for anything if the stored date is split and every split is encrypted. Even if you could decrypt the data you can't do anything with it because you are most likely missing the majority of the file.
People should have 0 concerns about these issues. 
Using tor would 1.) Make you already suspicious as well as make you bandwidth useless. It's just stupid to use for at this point. A simple VPN service would be more then enough and still useless.
2) encrypting your data is totally useless since it is already split encrypted. 
I wouldn't waste too much time on thinking about these things since you don't have to do anything.
@_date: 2014-03-04 10:30:36

low volume doesn't mean you can't trade there properly as on other exchanges.
Well you can't dump large amounts of coins there. But it's pretty ok for like 1-10 BTC daily trading.
But I think Kraken is going to get big in the future. They just need get things worked out in the u.s..
Keep in mind they are the only real exchange that tries to get everything worked out when it comes to licenses.
At least they will last very long, while exchanges like BTC-e have a much much darker future.

Better use Bitstamp / BTC-e or even Kranken (Amazing interface, nice support, working with the German Fidor Bank)

Its ok as long as its not your life savings. Everything on blockchain.info is working on your browserside they just store your encrypted wallet data and don't ever see your password.
That's why you can use the wallet even without internet connection once you logged in.
Just be save and store the wallet back up they can send you on a save place.
If you are thinking about storing life savings you should read up how a cold storage / paper wallet works.

Finding a block not so frequently could make you lose some money because if you are unlucky you won't find enough blocks in the last difficulty before the next difficulty. So on paper you make less money if you are unlucky. But could also make more money.

The insurance policy could be a good point.
But this going to increase the fees overall quiet a lot.
It's going to cost a lot because the insurance company will simply see Mt. Gox, Vircurex and the other exchanges that failed hard and will take a lot to assure fundings.
Maybe they could implement something so every customer can decide for itself if he wants to have an extra insurance.
But I don't think it does make sense.
@_date: 2014-03-31 14:06:44
it is ofc impossible to predict something in this market.
But all these really bad news from china and mt. Gox could break this "big picture" trend and burn us. Not badly as you said because their is a big basement we are operating on.
-More people then ever know and understood bitcoin.
-Bitcoin ATMs everywhere
-many and also big Merchants accept BTC / plan to. (But I think as long as they instantly dump the coins when the customer transfers them this is decently lowering the price over all.)
-Big Players should join at this low soon.
What do you think? Will we stay in the the logarithmic Channel oder break it and rise much slower linear?

No mining is a complete waste of money and electricity. You will never even be able to get the money back you paid for the mining device.
Just buy bitcoins on an exchange if the price is at a recent low and withdraw them as soon as you know how to keep your coins save on a personal wallet. If the amount is higher then a a few hundred $(over 5k$ for example) you should get additional security by creating and understanding paper wallets. Good luck and welcome!

@_date: 2014-03-27 19:08:18
You don't really to wait for any confirmmations. It's a missundersranding.
As long as you can see the transaction propagated to the network with proper fees you can be 99.9% be sure the money is transmitted. Only a double spend could cause problems. But credit card have higher refund request's then this.
If you spend larger amounts of money would you wait for like 6 confirmations? Yes you should. Even thought the chances are low that the transaction is going to cause problems, you should make sure and not be one of the 0.1%.
And in top if you buy something online the conformation time doesn't matter. Even buying a car should be possible to wait for 1h before finally picking it up.
Selling a coffee/shopping you are simply taking the super low chance of the BTC not going through.
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:42:13
If only btc-e could be p2p. 
It would simply be brilliant if a government couldn't shut btc-e down over night. It would also fit btc-e in general.
The only real concerned I have about btc-e at the moment is that they are getting more and more a target to governments and could even shut down over night.
 It's not the fact that they try the best to stay anonymous that concerns me. They simply have to stay anonymous.
Always keep in mind, btc-e NEVER disappointed or even failed.
@_date: 2014-08-17 20:55:12
well I guess you are not in the altcoin scene so much. But it's pretty normal for an altcoin to be mostly as an speculative mostly traded coin on an exchange. as Bitcoin was when it was young.
It takes some time until a coin gets real value and use. But until then the price is only driven by speculation if or if not will be a useful coin.

If it would be generally known what is going to happen its going to happen to happen pretty fast.
You can't predict what is going to happen next on stock/bitcoin market. The only real thing that is moving the market are big news that are surprising(if the outcome is pretty clear, the market moves before the news is published).

If it adds up over a long time scale, it should add up some loses. Not significant of course. If you have a larger farm this could be some $$$ in the end.

If you have the Fiat you decide if you are willing to pay the higher (buy) price or the lower (sell) price which on high volumes have often have a big spread

as long as they were not exchanged to alt coins you can follow the coins on the blockchain.
So in theory it should be possible to find out who cashed out at a exchange.
But just in theorie. It would be a long way till an exchange would give this information to a court in a case.

We are at a important point of the bitcoin system.
It's much more then an individual losing real USD in btc.
It's much more about a big downfall in what we have achieved already.
If bitcoin falls under 100$ the media is going to scare away every new person as well as every bigger investor. All the ponzi and scam screaming is getting spread and belived.
Guy we are at a branch on our way. Gox and mark fucking up as hard as they did already made us slow down and also turned on the turning-signals in the very wrong direction.

well, do you remember the Mintpal theft? The hacker stole about 40% of all VRC existing.
and since most people don't stake their coins it would be a high danger situation for a pos coin. The Blockchain was simply no secure because of that.
The discussion back then was the same. A lot of people said they can't just rollback the blockchain that would destroy credibility of the coin. But in fact it was the only way to save the coin. Some people don't understand this and just insist that the blockchain can't be changed. I disagree with that.
But in this case there were only 5% stolen. If the blockchain would have been rolled back it would just be to save Bter.
what do you think should the blockchain rolled back if over 40% of all coins would have been stolen?

And the problem is not the 3rd party controlling the data its people with much more controls getting access anytime to it they want without even a court seeing this. Aka NSA and FBI and all the other secret goverment agencies on this planet which not just want to protect people.

I feel like history is just repeating again.
At MtGox nobody wanted to believe the rumours that were not just from thin air. I there were people depositing larger amounts of money on Mtgox even when the withdrawal of both bitcoin and FIAT money were blocked for a longer then usual period of time.
I just gave up to understand how much $$$ you have to see in your eyes to so such things.
Now there are again rumours about an exchange. These rumours are again reasonable and concerning. But people still think :"this will never happen to me. Look how much $$$ I make!"
We simply don't need an secret exchange without any kyc neither any information who is running it or where it is even located.
The guys doing a great job, don't get me wrong. And I respect what they have done for us.
But it's also understandable if they would turn simply the exchange of and run off with the money and btc before facing jail for the worse things that brings a missing kyc on exchanges this size.
Why are you guys holding so strong on btc-e when there legal and working good alternatives? 
Pleas help me to understand.

By that I just mean blockchain.info is centralised wallet services in the end. 
Most things are done not on their server but in your browser on your computer local. 
So for non life savings they are awesome! But if you really want to store your btc safely for a longer term read up how to create paper wallets securely.
@_date: 2014-07-11 09:23:06
Even of they dump all coins instantly to fiat it is still a isn't step in the direction we want bitcoin to move. The more use bitcoin serves the more valuable it becomes. Even thought the price will be under a lot of pressure after the hype phase. This would also happen if Amazon or eBay add btc.
The next step that would be the break through is going to be reached when bitcoins can be uses for merchants to either pay their employees and also be able to pay bitcoins for production.
If this we reach this point... Jesus the price will skyrock as people predicted in their wet dreams.
But until then we have to stay on the rocky hard way people instantly dumping until the network effect steps in.
@_date: 2014-08-17 18:06:58
Yea sure. But it's the case of most altcoins especially if they are young.
it has changed, VRC has now the highest staking of all coins by far.
It's impressive this even't really changed the mind of a lot of people involved in VRC. I guess you have to get hurt by something like that before you remove your coins from a exchange.
and as most people still experience no damage by leaving coins on a exchange, this will reaped many times I guess. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 21:09:13
We should all prepare some well thought questions for that.
This could be a very important moment we can participate to as an individual representing Bitcoin and the direction we are going to head to.

There are no mining devices out there that would worth paying even shit on.
To everybody again and again: the mining times are over, if you want to get bitcoins, buy some on any big exchange and transfer them out of the exchange asap to you personal wallet.
---Don't throw your money into the asichole ---
Especially stay away from Bitmine.ch , hashfast and ofc Butterfly labs. They will take your money and shit on you like no other.

It's often much safer to keep them on these exchanges then on wallets you own.
They are only safer in paper wallets which private key never met the internet.
@_date: 2014-03-31 15:55:25
In theory yes.
You can't possibly buy the required amount of chips on the free market.
I am not sure but I guess China doesn't even has any chip factorys.
It is possible for sure, but I guess it wouldn't worth it at all. Just so create a fork of an alternative pay-system?
@_date: 2014-07-01 07:20:23
Do you consider adding altcoin like DRK or even Vericoin to the exchange?

Have to agree, kraken is by far the best way to get btc in Europe.

Would you still say that if so many coins were stolen that the network becomes not secure because of 51% attacks?
Just curious. Because for more this would be the only situation the rollback the blockchain since the coin would be dead if not.

But as said, investors want steady income instead of variances, as sad and stupid it sound and as bad as it is for the hole network.
The protocol just has to be changed. We are still on high reward times, I am kinda afraid what is going to happen when all the small miners tab out anmd just the big ming companies are left. This could end horrible if the protocol doesn't change before that.
@_date: 2014-08-03 19:21:37
We should create a nonprofit foundation with a good budged for opportunity's like this. The foundation should focus on special economic situations like this the reach as many people as possible.
Getting attention over a hole country which is facing high inflation rates like Argentina, Japan, Russia should be a focus spot currently. People will understand much faster the value of BTC and the potential it has. 
The potential network effect we could achieve in a short time would be amazing.
We just need a working Organization to make a special tailored plan for each country.
Bitpay and other should also get involved since they would benefit in the end enormously.
If we are able to collect enough money and find the right heads this would ignite the rocket again. We just need some smart heads to get behind this.
@_date: 2014-06-15 15:04:33

everything that is listed under sha256 coins can be mined with current ASIC miners.

Hashes per watt and by that the total power a board can have.
There are no real improvements in the near future possible like there were from CPU to GPU to FPGA to asics to 28nm asics.
15nm asics are possible but they won't bring so much improvements as needed. Maybe 10-15% more hashes per watt compared to 28nm.

I would go with it.
Sadly you missed the train for quiet a bit now. But still the potential winnings you could make with it outpaces the potential loses at the moment. 
I would say if you set yourself a limit of % you are willing to lose I would try it despite all the people crying all day and all night it would be stupid. Seeming stupid and crazy decisions could make you really big profits. It's even a lifetime opportunity if you chose so.
You always should keep in mind it is pure gambling. You could lose quiet a lot but I guess never everything if you stay smart.
I would suggest you to put everything on a SECURE paper wallet that you have tested and backed up several times and have multiple exchange accounts so you could sell everything off asap if something horrible happens.
For the rest you have to stay cool and never act emotional. Set a lose price that wouldn't ruin your life and stick to it if you don't see any hope. But keep in mind a few days back people said bitcoin is dead and sold everything. Today we got the first too the moon pictures.
Just try it if you know how to do it and get the bitcoin paranoid app on your phone.

Banks are lazy and most often don't give a fuck about security. Just have a look at the XP problem...

How should they reinvest it?
Just putting it on the bank would give give you barely any interest.
 To the loans.

I don't see anything of the 2% of the new created money every months and I guess 99% of the people also would be happy to get 2% more loan every month.
Wouldn't inflation exactly mean this?
Also the new creates money is somewhere in the system. It's not like the 99% get it somehow.

Thank you but I was more talking about real 3rd world countries like India, most African countries and so on.

Bter saved for now I would say. They will get ghostown in a few weeks.
You simply don't deserve a second chance as an exchange.
What we really need is a decentralized exchange. Hell why is there still no working for altcoins at least?
@_date: 2014-02-18 09:03:14
Don't be too angry on them. I think they have to remove every withdrawal manually.
I don't think BTC-e is scamming people, just give them a bit more time maybe open more tickets for this case.
@_date: 2014-06-14 10:50:54
I don't get what you are trying to express.

looks like the Price isn't reacting good to this.
@_date: 2014-02-18 09:39:52
they have another mentality.
They are simply tipping everything.
But even if you get just 5-15 Cent as a tip, it will rise over time and you can tip people with that tips as well. It's a endless cycle.

You should read a bit to understand the difference between an hash and encryption. Just Google it. 
An hash is a special number which is generated by a unique combination of information. It but you can't tell which information is contained in that hash just verify the information.

Anybody knows How big this risk actually is? Is guess since mining is decentralised and it worked out for over 5 years now, it's infinite small something could still happen.
And even if, there could always be a rollback to the last block if shit happens the fan. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 22:34:41
So we can expect the price to increase at a high pace. Nice
@_date: 2014-03-21 05:39:46
Get an account on btc-e /bitstamp and maybe even on Kraken and sell of small amounts (maybe 1 or even up to 50 if the market allows it) several times per day at good market price and be happy.
It would take you quiet some time, but you would get a much higher value and wouldn't move the market as hard.
On top you can sell small amounts on localbitcoins and bitcoin.de
Just spread them as good as possible.
@_date: 2014-03-25 11:32:02
Just keep in mind they are small. Bit if you compare how professional they behave and what they have dome already its outstanding.
We should heavily support them if they  can prove Fiat solvency as they did with fiat. Or even implement an insurance for foundlings they are definitely the best exchange we could ask for.
@_date: 2014-03-20 15:34:40
And it shouldn't sound like annoying spam ofc.
@_date: 2014-02-21 17:20:48

@_date: 2014-08-11 08:39:40
It's just not gonna happen. The us are build on printing the world currency on mass.
If they lose this ability a lot of rich/powerful people are going to lose control of the system. They will do everything to prevent BTC to overtake.
It's going to an hard and long game until then.
@_date: 2014-03-31 15:00:36
I don't think it is very likely somebody could get 51% nowdays.
The amount of chips needed and electricity would be unimaginable.
@_date: 2014-03-31 05:08:10
I am not saying p2p should provide total anonymity or something like that.
 That would open the door for money laundry widely.
To me p2p should provide security. So I could at least get my coins out and don't have to be concerned about a government shutting everything down over night. There will also always be some bank keep working with the the exchange as long as they can do profits out of this.
And there will always be several good and legal places where can sell your coins if it's coming hard.
P2p would at least protect us from shut downs and for a lot losing everything. So you can still get BTC out in the worst case/laziness scenario.

If we want to make bitcoin succeed in Argentina in the upcoming situation bitcoin has to be more accessable and useable then dollar.
Getting bitcoin to widespread food stores and offer a 5% discount would be amazing. If then the store companies keep the bitcoins and use them to pay the supplier and farmers, so speaking the hole food chain bitcoin could succeed. But we need people with connections and power to bring bitcoin to these places. We as a community can't do this.
@_date: 2014-03-29 14:31:58

Of course they can't freeze the Wallet like a bank could freeze your bank-account.
That's a difference.

Because the price was falling in a downtrend every day constantly. It was caused by the Chinese rumors. But it seems like all these rumors were wrong, so we are really close to leave the downtrend and grow constantly again.
Just as an advice: When most people are panic selling and there is blood you should buy. If you compare the price graph on bitcoinwisdom with the posts people opened you will see it. Always keep in mind that we it gets more likely that we fall again when more and more people freak out and post more and more to the moon posts. I am not that good of a treader overall.
There are some people who analyse the the price graphs and know quiet a lot about all this. For example here:

You can adjust almost everything there including the transaction fees.
Remember to make a back up an store it on a safe place.

The article leaves out the difficulty jumps every 9.5 days. Simple said if the variance is high and you get unlucky at the end of the difficulty but lucky on the harder difficulty you will lose income compared to mining in a larger pool where you always have a low variance in a difficulty.
Somebody should back this up by some numbers, this should result in a bigger difference then this article tells. just by logic if the pool is not super lucky at least.

The value behind bitcoin is the protocol and how many people use it.
And this value is unseen in the corrupt, fiat printing world.
Instead of crying about the price not kept rising exponentially you should spread the word to everybody and make the network even more valuable so wen can aim an uptrend again before aiming towards the moon.
Showing people bitcoin and make the understand it so say spread the word theirself is the real exponential growth of bitcoin. The price will rise again when the next economy or currency crash will creat panic. I can promise you that the next crash is going to happen relatively soon.

Because Bitcoins could be double spend. For example you have 2 btc on your Wallet. This would make this scenario possible: you can send 2 btc to an address and also on the same time 2 btc to another address.
This should be prevented by the prove of work, but since you own over 50% the chances of you find several blocks in a row (outpace the blockchain which saw this transaction as a double spend) and decide that your blockchain with the double spend is the right one.
You could say the hashing power you have is just the weight of your vote. With 50% of the hashing power you have a high chance you decide several times in a row what is legit and what is wrong because everybody is going to agree with it because it is getting confirmed several times in a row.
This makes everything fragile and insecure because bitcoin is losing what it is standing for
@_date: 2014-07-04 10:56:33

I don't think BTC-e is that bad.
@_date: 2014-03-31 13:58:27
I also think this price drop could attract a lot of rich people. 
Because these people simply waited for a good chance to join the party it would have been stupid by them joining it when the price was at 800$.
They only buy when people sell like it is the end. That's how they get rich.

@_date: 2014-03-25 22:29:27
We should spread the word and support kraken as much as possible.
Kraken could get the best exchange we could have ever asked for. Just the low volume (which looks like rising the past couple days?) scares people away at the moment. 
But if kraken is going to deliver and keep improving and implementing new features as they did recently, they should be able to outperform all other exchanges in the future.

But I guess nobody ever did that and its not easy to get information by an exchange in this case.

@_date: 2014-06-13 21:11:45
1) yes they find more often blocks but you get less paid per block. Overtime it doesn't really which pool you mine on.
2) you are right but it is still a concentration of hashingpower on a single pool. This is just a temporary solution.

Well if you could explain how this is a specific blockchain.info problem?
Its clear that the problem is not on the website wallet service but rather on the user side. People lost their money because in some way either their computer or their phone got compromised. (I know there was a broken private key generation so me when for a short time which made the key itself compromised but it was fixed rapidly.) Or they went on a phishing site which there are hundreds of...
I know it looks like blockchain.info is insecure but they aren't. The problem is many new and inexperienced user started are using using blockchain.info as their main wallet. Nothing wrong with that. But their computers are always full of maleware and spyware. On top they don't even know what these malewares look like. I am sure you know several people as well like these..
And these people are the problem. They falsy think blockchain.info stole their coins but in fact they got stolen by somebody else. Its the same as if your coins get stolen from your Multibit wallet on your computer. But people will not blame multibit for this and there for not post something about it.
If you could explain me how blockchain.info is insecure I my understand it. But for now I am pretty sure blockchain.info is as it can get with an online wallet. It runs in a sandbox on your Browser they online store your encrypted wallet. You can enable 2fa and even multisig for sending coins. I font know how much more security you guys expect.

@_date: 2015-05-18 17:21:04
Nobody knows.
But its likely some agency nocked on the developer door and wanted to have a backdoor build in.
Instead of making it another instrument of the surveillance they closed the project just like lavabit did. They blew the whistle. 
There was an complete audit of the 7.1a version. Result: it has no backdoor nor major issues. So its safe to say truecrypt 7.1a is secure. And only the version 7.1a is secure. No need of a fork or anything like that.

It's not the first time blockchain.info is down.
I trust them (even thought I had never any coins on a wallet there). I think they know what they are doing and have enough security rules which protect the value on there.
I guess LTC is causing this drop.

@_date: 2015-05-06 17:39:40
Agree with you. Lowering the spam and increasing the income of miners by making the transaction fees more dynamic should be something we should do.
Bigger block sizes will just lead to problems. As said for example Pools getting the new big blocks... nodes with an average (non Asian) DSL connection will not even be able to function as a node anymore.. Etc.
If the bitcoin price stays at 200 or even falls below (which is very likely) Bitcoin will be in a lot of trouble when the next block halving comes.

Don't say that the bitcoin evangelical people don't want to hear that
@_date: 2015-05-21 05:52:59
To be honest, this place is the wrong place to ask this question. Its full of blind Bitcoin evangelist. They would have told you at 1000$ to invest into Bitcoin because its just the beginning.
But fact is, nobody knows what the price will be in the future. Past performance doesn't indicate future performance. And as for now most trader expect Bitcoin to drop. Below 200 dollar maybe even dipping tom double digits... There for you can easily lose 50% of your money if it comes how traders think it will go(there are forces stronger then hope...)
Surely Bitcoin is amazing and mind blowing but its far away from being ready for the non geek world to be used and even farer away from mass adoption that most people want to hear in this place. It will at least take 5 more years in my eyes before we can even think about challenging credit cards and so on..
If you are OK with losing 50% or even more on the short term and the money is not several years of savings fuck it and buy it. If not I would be very careful. Many people here bought at 1000 dollar and above because of fomo(fear of missing out). 
If the money is a lot for you I wouldn't invest it all in Bitcoin. Start with 200$ and see how Bitcoin feels and works how's to secure it or use it.. Then when people are start crying Bitcoin is dead (dropping bellow 200) I would consider buying a larger stash coins.
Place always a limit. Once the price drops under a limit (currently I would set the limit to 200-210$ I would sell everything and buy again when the storm is over and it looks like it reached a bottom...) Never buy something on the long term and say the price is irrelevant because its the most important thing in the end. That's how you become a bagholder burning money.
As outstanding Bitcoin is nobody can tell you if Bitcoin will really take of or just always stay as a underground currency.
@_date: 2014-04-05 13:44:09
How do the majority of people get the new created money? Banks do get the money the very first.
Loans don't increase in the same rate as the inflation does. The difference quiet big. And since the system is compounded interested, inflation exponationlly makes banks richer while the 99 get exponentially poorer compared to the 1%.
So pleas explain me what i didn't understand?
@_date: 2014-05-26 14:42:04
We had a 30% increase in 5 days. 
Just be patience. This super fast grow just makes the next bubble explode much faster and harder. I would be happier with a slower reliable growth.
@_date: 2014-04-09 12:04:10
Because the interest-based world we live in creates a 	vicious circle called compound interest.

If they really have lost most of their Bitcoin due to the bug known since 2011.
Then explain me pleas how on earth they could rebuy over a million Bitcoins on the market?
Losing all Bitcoins out of their cold wallet would be as sure the end of Mt.Gox as the Amen in the church.
@_date: 2015-05-18 17:58:52
Yea extrapolating made people buy bitcoin at 1200$ and threads saying bitcoin could go to 100 000$ within a couple weeks...
It can also easily be the top as well.
I also have to agree. 68k$ is nothing. Bitcoin generates 3600 coins per day that's ~850 000 $ each day generated.
@_date: 2014-05-02 06:16:50
But you understand that exchanges are there to exchange bitcoin &lt;=&gt; FIAT in both ways? This is not called pump &amp; dump.

I agree. Just wait. If the first attempt of the hard fork fails its going to be the best opportunity to buy this year most likely.
It's not like as if Bitcoin itself can break if the hardfork fails.

I expected them to be "hacked" and run away with all the founds of their customers who store their btc there until today. (who are asking for losing them).
@_date: 2015-01-10 10:18:52
Well even if they won't lose any more btc now. There are still several things you have to keep in mind.
1.) They lost over 5 million $ in btc. They lost money of all their customers. Once Bitstamp loses a considerable number of customer (which they will for sure after they screw up) they will go bankrupt and the same story like mt. Will start again.
2.) As far as I understood another company is supporting them with multi signature. Sure its an improvement in terms of security. But in the end its another point of failure. Also they are hosted on amazon servers now which are also just another point of failure they can't control
3.) Nobody knows how they lost the coins. So it could happen again. Either its a bug in the code (which I am pretty sure they can't be sure its fixed after just this short time or an internal person got access to the wallet and stole the private keys (hard to impossible to prove). So as long as they don't release an report I assume it could happen again.
4.) If there is a law procedure on going because of all this, it could be possible they get shut down without warnings. Very unlikely but even worse things have happened. Just a court has to call amazon now and its closed.
Judging by all these things I would suggest to not use Bitstamp anymore until at least the hack got fully cleared out and how their plans are now.  I mean they screwed up hard and we can be happy they didn't close their business. Now they have to gain trust again before we could suggest Bitstamp to anyone.
In the end, we need a working decentralized exchange and not another bank we give up the control of all the assets completely over to lazy and greedy companies.
@_date: 2015-01-09 22:04:42
It would be much more professional to not being hacked or just not being so lazy and leave 5 million $ on the presentation tablet
@_date: 2015-01-27 08:56:42
Shortly? They are the oldest and most reliable exchange out there... Don't fix some thing that isn't broken.
@_date: 2014-08-17 21:51:10
will I guess you have think about it differently.
If you leave 40% of all coins to a single person who stole it the coin essentially becomes useless (This is impossible for BTC but for many altcoins it's possible.) If you don't rollback the coin becomes essentially worthless. Why wouldn't you roll back the blockchain?
I don't understand what people saying this trying to achieve with it. I mean you have to choose between making the coin useless and worthless or rolling back the blockchain to prevent this.
Why would you not do this?
@_date: 2014-04-07 12:01:00

I was just wondering.
I daytraded yesterday for the first time (with a small amount) several times and were able to make about 8% instead of losing anything in $.
I was just wondering why there are so many people pump the price to a high after which it falls almost the the beginning of the 15min candle. 
Maybe it was just pure luck over the 15 trades of the day. But I was almost always able to see when to buy and sell.
Sure it is impossible to do this with higher volume. But still I almost know nothing about trading and were still able to do pretty good I guess.
I was just wondering.
@_date: 2015-01-14 23:08:32

It wouldn't even have risen so hard without Mt. Gox....
@_date: 2015-01-10 09:00:40
Why would the hardware be compromised.... When the code is bad or an internal person just stole the private key of the hot wallet.... Even if they have brand new hardware it wouldn't change anything...
If somebody internal gets excess to the wallet its pretty easy to steal all the btc and nobody can ever proof how the coins got lost. I mean the person stealing the money will lose his job in worst case if the company goes bankrupt and he will have a lot of money to launder over the next year or so but in the end he is one of the 1%.
I guess this also happened at Mt. Gox

First of all we would need much more merchants of the daily live to except bitcoin. Even thought they instantly dump it for fiat.
Next step would be keeping the btc partially and start paying wages to the employees in btc if they want to.
This transition will take time since we need much more and better application for Bitcoin.
Once we are there the price won't be volatile any more and fiat would be done.
The upcoming Fiat(euro) / bank failure should be the perfect timing to start this chain.

But instead they are down voting everything and ignore these critical condition at Bitstamp.
@_date: 2015-01-08 00:43:27
The problem is they won't audit/tell if their cold store is pretty small. It would just mean bitstamp is dead with the stolen coins.
Something smells really fishy here. I get the same feeling I had with empty gox. Time will pass by, the 48h will end and they will announce that they are still not done. Building an exchange from scratch on would take several months to be sure everything works without major errors. Testing and finding possible holes that would make another hack possible would take at least the same time.
I don't want to make people panic, but don't expect too much. Mt. Gox also released everything is already we will be back online soon. With ltc on top until we all got punched in the stomach... 
@_date: 2015-01-09 09:07:11
Btc-e is not just somehow good... we can be happy to have btc-e from the beginning. Yes they are relatively anonymous but they are also by far the most reliable exchanged out there. Kraken has the potential to get there as well but they have a long road ahead until then.
So far, thanks to btc-e and the crew working for not fucking up and scamming everyone over.

@_date: 2015-01-13 09:20:24
You really have to keep in mind. The 1200 bubble was mainly caused by Mt. Gox Willi not sadly. Who knows if we even go double digits even. But if you don't take any risk you can't make any money. Just keep calm sell and wait for an entry point that would be crazy to no buy back in.
Btc itself is not broken at all. The bubble just needs to be sold before we can go back the euphoric times.

@_date: 2015-01-13 23:58:46
Well, if think long term it is a low.  Sure we could drop to 150 or even 100. But I am pretty sure this is temporary. People are freaking out currently. Just take a look at the sub here. But in the end we are at the bottom if you think like 1 year ahead. I will bookmark this and send you a tip when we are 200% up.
Its not like Bitcoin has became worthless or broken or anything, its just people at panic because they lost quiet a lot of money because they bought when the price was at the bubble high at 1000$. Same thing is going to happen on the stock market once the alltime high is there. Once you understood the system and how people think you will be able to make constantly money out of stock markets / bitcoin just don't get emotional. Buy in a panic sell at a high.
@_date: 2015-01-11 00:05:08
All these Ignorant people here don't care about all this hokus pokus technical shit. They didn't change their behaver after Mt. Gox and they didn't change anything after they bearly escaped another total lose at Bitstamp for now.
I am really starting to worry about this community... 
@_date: 2015-01-15 11:00:50
I don't own many btc but I did at least 10 trades the last few days. I guess that's quiet normal.
On top the Chinese exchanges have a 2-4 times fake volume at least on top they have no fees so some people will have traded a couple hundred times the past few days just. 
They volume was really high in general yes. I would be surprised if more then 50k coins changed hands in the end. Most people just went short and bought back lower. Most people sold low and bought back low. Some people sold low because they thought crypto is done. These people buy back right now at a btc lose.
@_date: 2015-05-18 17:36:10

The market was bullish the last couple days. But overall we are still in a heavy downtrend. It's just the old pattern repeading. I am not even sure if we will hit 300. Better be safe an sell at 250 or if you like it risky at 270 or even 300. But don't get trapped while trying the break even. 
The next drop could be the least before we finally leave the best market.
@_date: 2015-01-09 22:38:37

The Bitcoin community is just full of monkeys down voting every critical comment which doesn't fit in their world. That's also the reason many people lost a lot of money in gox. They barely escaped another huge lose at Bitstamp for now. Judging by the comments these people didn't learn anything and still don't understand the situation Bitstamp and they are in.
For example: all this "hodl" talk is funny like hell but I am pretty sure many people lost a lot of money by hodling the expensive coins they bought while being in a bear market for over a year now... 
I totally agree with your comment. Bitstamp acts like 5 million $ are like peanuts which they lost. Like: "whops I just my bag. Well shit happens. I have another bag. As long as there are bags left everything is fine... Who gives a shit. let's forget this and act like nothing happened. Let's tip some celebrity and show all how much money we have in our new bag.

Just use Blockchain.info online wallet. I know reddit is paranoid and believes everything that is written in the internet but fact is:
Blockchain.info is working browser basedside not server based. Means: they only have the encrypted Wallet.dat container on the server + possible 2-way authenticator in order to get access to your wallet.dat.. Means once you are on the Wallet creating website you can actually unplug your internet connection and still create new wallets. The privat key is actually created in your web browser encrypted and send to the blockchain.info server.
99% of the "I lost my Bitcoins on Blockchain.info" Stories are pure User Failure. For example:
-importanting a wallet from a compromised system or an insecure online source.
-accessing the wallet from a compromised system.
-falling for pishing sites (there were many for a time period. Some where 1:1 copies which even accrued in Google search 1 page.)
And yes there were some when a few hours a bug in the code so the generated private keys were not random. But the issue was solved the same day. So if you want to avoid this possibility just set up a wallet, print everything out and wait for 1 week or so before using it to avoid possible bugs on the side that could result in something like that.
So if you have a basic understanding on security and just pay a bit attention, Blockchain.info (I know reddit thinks they are evil bad people)  is a pretty good place to store several coins in a hot wallet. But most of your coins should be stored on a cold wallet that is properly set up.
In the end I recommend blockchain.info online wallets until somebody can proof me single satoshi got stolen that isn't a result of bad usage.(beside the bad key bug)

The more people cry and give up about the price, the more I am thinking about buying. You will won't make any money if you don't take a risk.
We are currently at the state of "buy when people panic sell"
1200-600 where clearly "Sell while people are in euphoria."

Well you will lose money buying in at a high because the potential is much lower then having bought in a low
That's how the regular dude always loses his money. He bought when the market did awesome and it were everywhere in the news how great things are going. But later he sold like most people when panic is the marker.
It's called: "buy when there is blood on the streets and sell when people are euphoric." --- its super hard to do because we all are very emotional, but that's how you really make money. Chasing a trend will more likely cause you to lose money then make money.
The big traders all went short long time ago and surely thinking about to buy in right now. At least I am thinking about it,because there is defiantly a lot of blood on the streets currently.

The Bitcoin network will not be able to run efficiency with blocks even larger...
Most nodes will net even be able to share 20mb&gt;blocks in 10min ... Therefore much much more centralised in the end. Bitcoin shouldn't be either for free. Miners will have to be paid in transaction fees as well once the next block halving comes.
Sure bitcoin has to be able to handle more transactions in the end. But hard forking now could also result in a really ugly situation of not enough people update their node...

There is no reason to use a fork of truecrypt.
Especially since the version 7.1a is completely audited. The audit showed no backdoors or any major flaws in the code itself.
Forking an audit version would just create new problems as long as the new version is not audited as well....
Truecrypt 7.1a is safe to use.

Don't spend any money on mining equipment. You will most likely not even be able to break even.

@_date: 2014-03-03 16:32:54
Done! Confirmed and everything is fine! I guess too many people still pay the old fees, so it most likely takes as long as if you would pay no fees at the moment. 
If you want to be very sure about the fees, just pay triple or even more of transaction fees so it will go threw as fast as possible.
I would always do this moving large amounts of money like you did.

you could use VirWox without verification with your Credit Card. Limits start low but increase the more you deposit.

Their Platform is just total rubbish even written in ruby. Just like Bitstamp.

I am ofc not talking about big guys investing into bitcoin but if there is even a very little number of people thinking bitcoin is really an alternative and they would invest into it would make the price explode... But instead we are still in a bear market .. Bitcoin is tiny .. It's not even a 1/400 of the market cap of the apple stock.. So if only a tiny tiny bit of money would fload into bitcoin we would see 2x price very easy and fast..
But the fact nothing is happening just shows that nobody is interested even thought the s&amp;p500 consolidating for over 1 year now and starting to drop hard recently... Same with dax, Nikkei 225 and the FTSE dropping of the cliff there is no fresh money coming in..
The recent flash crash on bfx cleared the order book and there are 7,5 times more margin longs then shorts...  (25million $ longs to 14500 btc short...) 
I wonder where all these margin longs want to close their position into ... We will see a big freefall at some point with no big bounce .. At least I expect this to shake out all the perma bullish long positions in bitcoin..

Batteries don't create energy.
I have build an autarkic solar system just for a 210 watt pump for my fishpond...
It needs at least 3 better 4 Solar Panels (each 130watts) to work in the summer time for just like 5-7 hours per day at best conditions. If there are constantly just a few clouds per day the total number of power output already plummets.
I have 2 20pah solar batteries. Each of them is as expensive as a Bitcoin miner itself. It can store quiet a lot of energy but these batteries have a lifetime of max. 6-8 years before you have to replace them.
You need regulator for the solar charging which has an efficiency of ca. 90%.
The batteries can easily have 70%.
You need a power converter from 12v or 24v to 240 or some strange american standard. It has to be an sinus converter which makes everything even more expensive. Not systems
simple power converter.
Efficiency: 80% maybe.
I know most of you think they are smart and know a better answer for everything on this planet. But you guys have just not a basic idea of anything.
Even if you are living in a more sunny region you will not be able to run a bitcoin miner from a solar system and be able to get any money back you invested into it. Its just bullshit with current systems...

@_date: 2016-02-29 12:00:29
I would say no. Bitcoin is an highly speculative investment. Despite what many will tell you here, there is a real possibility of losing 90+% of your invested money. If these are all you savings this is not an investment strategy. Invest in crises safe assets look for actual gold if you want a long term secure investment.
You can put 20% into bitcoin if you want to gambnle and the rest in safe havens. If this is all your savings and you can't access it for 3 years I wouldn't even do that tbh.
Investing heavily your savings in bitcoin is gambling and not a long term investment.

I would much rather hear a debate with people who understood bitcoin completely and have still a sceptical view.
I mean if you say something that isn't full of bitcoin love / perma bullishnes and against the current world you will just get down votes and market as a troll.
But in the end more and more people just leave bitcoin because the sentiment spread just doesn't fit the actual situation. Bitcoin isn't ready and it will take still a lot of time until it is really more useful then the traditional system which is ofc not good as well.

Bitcoin in its current form isn't even good as a currency for daily life. Its more a store of value that can be easily transfered.
We would need working sidechains to even think about competing with global players like visa or just applepay.

Surely you can imagin bitcoin is the solution for the inflation problem, but bitcoin far away from being a real alternative to the fiat money. It's in the end still a high speculative asset...
The Local fiat currency will always be able to buy you food. Bitcoin can not provide that security. And if you are worried about your savings there ate better ways to have a stable store of value then bitcoin is. I am not saying bitcoin has nothing behind it. 
But stop telling people bitcoin is an safe way to invest your inflationary money..

162 btc wouldn't even move the price on most known exchanges.

We'll see

Well the market was just about to turn several times now. 
Its not that I don't want bitcoin to succeed. I just explained why I think it might be a good time to sell.

Never had a single problem in over 3 years and not planing to change it despite all the rumours going around here..

I love this accumulation theory all the time... It was the most used line in the altcoin scene.. You can read it all over the litecoin as well.
Ofc some do accumulate but in the end a falling price does mean there is not enough demand. Bagholders are created =&gt; preparation for the next big dump
As long as the demand higher the price will go down even if people do accumulate..

The first problem is we will never experience the deflationary phase.
@_date: 2015-10-11 22:52:15
Totally agree with you.
Stupid people are the problem not Bc.info.
And this sub is fluted with people who lost their btc in BCinfo because their computer are compromised anyway...

Try to explain Joe why he should use this magic internet money which the government is blocking and you will exclusively only be able via a VPN 
If you guys really think this isn't horrible you guys lost completely the connection the reality...

Down voting is proving me it just..
@_date: 2015-02-10 15:09:18
People are greedy and stupid at the same time. Just take a look at the altcoin scene /mining pre orders and how many $$$ got burned over there. Its pathetic..  Even today people keep investing in altcoins blindly with a lot of money to get scammed over and over again... --&gt; Paycoin...
@_date: 2015-02-15 02:20:05
Better sell on a rise then on a dump. Good decision if you don't want this roller coaster anymore...
God luck! Come back when we are sub 100 and the jerks selling then :)

@_date: 2015-02-15 14:59:51
See? You did the right decision! :) dont listen to the Parma Bulls in Forums or in reddit.
Buy low sell high.
@_date: 2015-02-03 20:58:23
Yea.. Don't just be a blind perma bull... We could retest the old low at 166$ before getting real growth.. We broke down on an important triangle and the confidence in the market is destroyed. Let's see where this goes. Good luck

I want a snickers tomorow  :(
@_date: 2015-03-01 13:33:55
Yeay its cheap, just How many $$? 
@_date: 2015-02-10 15:03:14
So sell?
@_date: 2015-02-01 00:04:04
What do you mean by bank? With Bitcoin you can have your own bank. Just go to Blockchain.info/wallet create a wallet and send your your coins there and use it. Make sure to use as many Security features as possible. Double password and maybe even 2w authentication. !ake sure to print everything out before using it.
If you have a lot of coins I would suggest to create a paper wallet in a secure environment.
Have fun! 
@_date: 2015-02-10 14:56:06
Well thats the reason why all the permabulls constantly lost money over 1 year.

What have we learned about good news?
Sell Sell Sell Sell!
@_date: 2015-02-12 15:40:13
Not really....
@_date: 2015-02-12 15:23:21
Bitcoin will not always work at 0 fee. Once have the 2ndor even 3rd blockhaving we will get in trouble keeping a high security network.. People have to understand that nothing is for free not even a Bitcoin transaction. Currently you are paying it with the inflation of your coins. Sooner or later you have to pay the miner to keep the network healthy. The more transaction per second we have then the cheaper it gets for you. Bitcoin needs mass adoption to stay alive. 
It was the vision of satoshi and intended.
@_date: 2015-02-12 18:35:51
It can support it and even compete. Didn't Gavin test a larger block size an said 20mb per block and even up to 20gb per block shouldn't be a problem?
