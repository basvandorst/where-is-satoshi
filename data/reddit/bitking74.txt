Is this for real?
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:58:22
No, but there is too much hysteria that I want to counteract. Also I haven't heard too many users hear on the board complaining that they lost their funds
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:29:50
How do you got this list anyway?
@_date: 2016-08-06 14:00:37
Agreed. Your thinking one more step ahead. Bitfinex owned by users and ownership registered on the blockchain with colored coins that can be traded.  Fantastic...  And fair 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:44:23
who controls the keys?
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:36:19
the most likely scenario is that 100 user accounts were hacked and emptied. 100 times ? maybe 20? would be a loss of 2000 bitcoin. Bitfinex would not be so dumb to store their bitcoins online, they will have some nice cold storage. I hope so
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:38:49
Probably 300 user accounts hacked with 10 BTC on average deposit.
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:26:27
the transactions that you highlight are roughly 1.6 mln USD. If that would be the damage it would all cool

True that. Anyway according to the fudster tether can singlehandedly push the market up. So why is this not happening? Because they don't do it

Roger Ver spending his last Bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-01-28 07:39:05
The trading volume of Bitcoin was $ 8 bn for the last 24 hours. If tether would print now 100m out of thin air and try to pump the BTC price they would probably be able to lift the price by 2 or 3 percent. Long term prices follow fundamentals anyway. Bitcoin was driven by a huge number of people trying to get in the boat. Look at Coinbase stats, their userbase grew exponentially last year. You can't really pump Bitcoin without fundamentals supporting it, even if I were to give you 1 bn. That's nothing 
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:58:31

why do you do an AMA?
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:17:19
I am not a fan of Tether. But since I work in finance I can assure everyone here that it is impossible to drive up the price of Bitcoin from $2000 to $20000 with just $1 bn printed tether. 
Even more important is. When tether succeeded to drive up the price they would be sitting on $4-5 bn profits. There would be absolutely no solvency issue whatsoever. So however you spin that evil tether it's not gonna crash.
The bears should start dealing with it, Tether is a non issue

There is different contributing factors to the lower BTC transactions, one factor is the lower volume of all cryptos, there is probably much less money moving between the exchanges. Also the blocks are more efficient since we achieved 16 percent+ segwit transactions. But what we really don't see anymore is these bulk of spam transactions. It's all more an observation than a proof
@_date: 2018-01-28 04:01:06
You can't compare Bitcoin to rounds of VC financing because
1) in VC rounds nobody sells, Bitcoin has constant selling, the higher the price the more selling
2) VC companies are not publicly listed and not traded, completely different game

Observing the stock market for mode than 2 decades, there are phases where low quality stocks are in favor followed by a much longer phase where quality rules.

Try this. Reverse hashing is a trial and error method, has nothing to do with computation. The mining chips are designed to do billions of random trials per second to solve the mining puzzle. The first miner to solve this mining puzzle will put 3000 transactions from the pool of unconfirmed transactions into a block an mine it. Also he will receive a mining reward. It's absolutely random who will find the solution to the puzzle but the more computation power one miner contributed the higher his chances. That's why it's comparable to a lottery. No need to solve complex math problems

I have a background of 25 years of finance. Worked as a fund manager. For the next 12 months or longer Bitcoin will be the only crypto currency being taken serious by the Financial community (because of the futures trading but also because of the longest history). All. Other coins can only hope for spillover effects. Like the litecoin spillover, this will happen all over again. Bitcoin will continue to outperform altcoins which does not mean that you cant get lucky with an altcoin

@_date: 2017-12-12 22:49:21
Actually what I meant is. Institutions indicated healthy demand. They were not really buying, because there was no liquidity, the futures just trades a hefty premium (which indicates demand). To me that's genius, Bitcoin goes up and institutions still haven't bought in 
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:46:24
Just finished your thought
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:30:04
Fair point, my gut tells me that a lot of people still want in, especially institutional but also retail. My guess is we see 25k before we go below 10k

@_date: 2017-12-12 22:31:29
Maybe maybe. But the real reason why Bitcoin had a run since 5000 is the announcement of the futures. Bitcoin is a totally under owned asset class by banks and asset manager. The futures gives them access. The fear of shorts was bullshit all along. The real buying interest comes in next week. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:49:00
I would not be worried about shorts from wall street. For every short on the WS there a 2 or 3 longs on WS. Short positions are rocket fuel. I think the new equilibrium price with WS is 25k

Have the same thoughts, we will need much more blocksize, but also once you have a payment channel open, the exchanges could actually wire to your LN channel, or you will receive your salary on your LN channel. Maybe the settlement/opening/closing of payment channels could be drastically limited

Ask them what the performance was if you had invested 2 years ago. 
Also why do you pay members referral fees, isn't that what ponzi scheme do?
 Also how do you compete with Chinese miners, they get the mining chips earlier and the electricity almost for free
can you provide an audited result of their mining efforts? 
How come that their mining market share keeps on down (only 1.3%), if there were so profitable they would reinvest had a bigger share

@_date: 2017-02-16 10:21:10
Regulation and fundamentals of Bitcoin are not necessarily that much correlated. The fundamental of Bitcoin is the global usage. Is a Zimbabwan farmer that needs Bitcoin to protect him and his family from monetary destruction and purchase Bitcoin affected by a trading ban in China? No! Bitcoin will become a global authority and the solution for many problems and Chinese trading and regulations are not chaning the fundamentals of Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-02-07 17:23:57
This is mathematically accurate but missing the point. The miners are competing for BTC, once the BTC reward is 0 they will only be paid in transaction fees which will owrk too and they wont be $6

3 percent down if not approved, it's very unlikely according to some research reports,  so basically its priced in. However if it gets approved I would see plus 10 percent in one day. TBH I a more excited when CBOE will launch a futures,  the the real institutional money can flow in

Agreed, I said it before, the high volume and margin trading on Chinese exchanges is no good. I would also not mind to completely shut them down. The Chinese that want to buy Bitcoin can do it anyway, if they can buy real estate abroad they can buy Bitcoin, as simple as that

Even if China would ban Bitcoin, which they won't,  don't forget they will buy it. How else do they buy all the overseas property,  in London,  in the US, big Chinese buyers. They somehow manage to get the money out of the country 
@_date: 2017-02-16 08:41:37
The intention of the post is to prove that Bitcoin can go up without China leading. Just hated it when people are constantly looking at Chinese prices. Anyway Chinese will continue buy Bitcoin even if there are no exchanges (example 1  If Chinese can buy pro property abroad and somehow circumvent capital control that means they can buy Bitcoin too.

This is the exact reason why they won't shutdown the normal exchanges. With them PBOC can enforce KYC and AML. with localbitcoin they can do nothing. Also the website is not run on Chinese servers, so what can they do about it?
@_date: 2017-02-18 21:18:30
Approved =&gt; BTC = $1400
Not approved =&gt; BTC  = $1000
Likelihood &lt; 20%
@_date: 2017-02-16 08:21:36
Good! With or without a regulated exchange Chinese will buy Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-02-16 17:18:32
That's good measure starting next week,  when we are approaching ATH on low vol. But true days would be interesting too
@_date: 2017-02-07 17:47:37
No I don't agree with the comparison, it will be a bun per transaction. You will need to only pay this from time to time to top up or settle your payment channel
@_date: 2017-02-06 07:34:44
Your math is actually right. Maybe the chances are 10 percent of approval. I can see Bitcoin going up 30 percent in one week,  but not more. Having said that I can see an extremely positive long term effect resulting from a potential approval like 401k savings.  We are all in for the 10000+ aren't we? 
@_date: 2017-02-16 12:02:54
Sorry for the misunderstaning. So we both agree that Bitcoin will go up ;)
@_date: 2017-02-16 14:06:15
I did and it tells me that bo and leveraged Trading does not do good for Bitcoin.  Hey were you the guy that said the same at 750 that bitcoin will never be the same again without China. Anyway Chinese will get there hands on Bitcoin either way 
@_date: 2017-02-08 09:59:25
Sorry for my English, this should be better
"The price only went down 4%  on the Chinese FUD (China ban Bitcoin again) after huge bull run"
@_date: 2017-02-03 11:27:21
exactly my hope too. F2pool (43% market share) wants to start signalling within 2 weeks
@_date: 2017-02-16 08:45:31
We are celebrating that Bitcoin can go up without the rest of world focussing on Chinese prices. Bitcoin can sustain without China leading the way up. Many people feared that Bitcoin will halve without China. Now they are proven wrong

all good in Bitcoinland

They are not. The shorts that shorted at 950 are the scared ones now

Thanks for sharing. What could possibly go wrong with a guy named beer brewery (pivovar is Czech for brewery)? He sounds very reasonable, question : is he the one that delayed the ETF? 
@_date: 2016-01-05 07:36:46
Because Bitcoin transaction are irreversible. It's like when Amazon would accept cash they should give discount. Currently they pay visa on average 2% and therefore only get 98 cent from the dollar. If Amazon would accept Bitcoin directly they should give an incentive. Experts of the airline industry calculate the advantage of direct and irreversible payments put to 5%. If they lose a seat to credit card fraud they lose 100%. All I am saying: reward BTC payments
@_date: 2017-02-09 16:25:34
I try to see beyond what the market is doing in the first 60 minutes. From my point of view it's a clear overaction. The rebound supports that. We will see more tomorrow
@_date: 2017-02-16 18:26:32
Don't get me wrong, I want 100 million Chinese buying each 1 BTC. Of course Chiense will find a way to get Bitcoin, not doubting that. I just don't want people to be looking religiously at the ping pong trading bot volume in China, thanks that's over now
@_date: 2017-02-16 22:43:07
I am proud of Bitcoin owners taking less interest in PBOC,  this is how it should be,  there was no reason for a pullback in first place. Bitcoins success is not dependant on Chinese ping pong trading bots, the drop from 1180 to 750 was never justified

Ask the basher in the boards. They think if China is out of the picture Bitcoin would have. I never said that. I was openly excited about less Chinese influence. Sure Chinese exchanges might resume trading normally at some point, all I want to tell the reddit users: stop looking at China, Bitcoin can go up without China, stop whining, have some balls

Over the past 2 years I had a very good response rate. It seems like in the last 1-2 months they have added many customers and maybe their support lags a bit now. I am sure they will be on track soon 
@_date: 2016-03-07 07:39:34
The only rational explanation is that users are disappointed and want higher blocksizes

I don't want to hear 'China ban Bitcoin' anymore`!
Alright? Deal?

You can downvote them. But others are allowed to upvote. Everything else is censoring
@_date: 2017-02-09 14:08:22
I fail to find this news particularly awful. Bitcoin stabilised without any major Chinese trading. In fact it was good that Chinese could not leverage,  für he today's news is neutral,  or even net positive 
@_date: 2017-02-06 19:52:34
Understand, but how do we fix this? I think all Bitcoiners want scaling,  either on or offchain. There is no central authority,  I know but there got to be a way to find a consensus 
@_date: 2017-02-15 08:18:31
Maybe..  On the other hand Pboc can't ban Bitcoin anyway, they can regulate the trading. Bitcoin us declared a virtual  commodity and there is nothing that PBOC can do about it 
@_date: 2017-03-30 17:15:19
Yes some banks do that now, but typically for higher sums 
@_date: 2017-03-06 06:30:16
There can't be more shorted than the inflow. Example if the inflow is 200 mln the maximum that can be shorted is 200 mln. It's highly unlikely that all of the ETF shares will be shorted, so the net inflow into Bitcoin will be definitely positive. Also the shorts don't technically sell on the Bitcoin exchanges, they will sell to new longs that are happy to buy Bitcoin under the market price. So I don't think this will be an issue. I suspect that a max of 20% of the float will be shorted. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 18:03:40
I reduced my leverage to 1 before the decision 
Edit: I meant to say 0 leverage or no leverage

Fidor is Bitcoin friendly, but wire unfriendly. I had a lot of problems with international wires. Still it might be the right bank open an account since they will never kick you out for buying Bitcoin. Since the GBP wires to Kraken are suspended I would consider trying   
@_date: 2017-03-06 20:02:34
Hope all this is feasible. Lumino layer with 2000 transactions per second sounds fantastic

Me too, I had limit orders at 900, nothing happened 
@_date: 2017-02-14 13:56:34
To me it's net positive. There are more and more AML and KYC regulations and that's fine. Who buys Bitcoin is registered as if you would open a bank account that' fair. What is positive about this is that they don't want to kill it. This fear was spread a lot , for me it was never real, but now we know there should be no fear of "China ban bitcoin"

News for you: payment processor like bitpay charge only 0.5% - why ? Because it's like a super efficient cash payment except much less hassle. Amazon does not have to hold Bitcoin. I expect that these fees will go down when the volume rises over time. 0.1% sounds fair to me on the long run, savings still 1.9 to 2.9 % compared to credit cards

This is something instititutional investors are looking for. Especially when the ETF does not get approved.
@_date: 2017-03-30 17:20:36
The logic behind this is that the European central bank charges negative interest rate for deposits. Small deposits don't really matter too much in the banks profit and loss. They want to punish big deposits as they really incur significant costs

Correct, Fidor UK won't be fast, probably takes one/two day. I am not sure if they rip you off with Euro wires. I am not happy with the currency conversion of Fidor Germany. Try to  GBP to Kraken.

SegWit Vote: the First Results
2017-01-30 23:27 UTC
As promised, here are the first results of our SegWit support vote! So far, 106 of our miners have expressed their preference. By hash rate, 16.3% have voted Yes, while 0.3% have voted No. The large majority of active miners, however, have not yet voted or are abstaining.
@_date: 2017-01-22 12:08:23
Finally! China show us your real volume! I am happy when China shows up in the future statistics with not more than 50% of the global trading.
@_date: 2017-01-18 21:45:56
Disagree. Abra is devoted to Bitcoin. Also I don't think that AirBNB accepting Bitcoin will change much. Steam also accept Bitcoin, it's all medium news. The real killer for now is remittance, this is the first real problem what Bitcoin solves.

I hear your pain, am there too. So in other words: give up on SegWit? 
It's true that the utility companies are running the miners , but they are managed by some entrepreneurs. Also it's the pools that ultimately decide to adopt it. So there is a chance that they signal for SegWit. The dilemma in Bitcoin is that you have two opposing sides in combination with not decisive miners. I wish that less than 20% of the mining power would be in China, this could solve things
@_date: 2016-06-11 21:03:00

They will trade further and they should. Market share of yuan trading dropped below one third in the last 24 hours,  that's brilliant 
@_date: 2017-01-19 20:03:51
I know what you mean. But the yuan and the dollar price of Bitcoin are both spot prices,  its not like yuan is the forward of the USD price. The only reason they drifted apart so much is that you can't arbitrage Yuan and USD. I am trading stocks for 25 years. Rule of thumb: margin trading in smaller or midcap companies increased volatility. In the case of Bitcoin its more mental margin trading,  that's not healthy.  I agree when you trade plus500 CFD, you are probably not including the spot price,  but if you trade directly on the spot market you certainly do
@_date: 2017-01-25 15:51:56
That a pie chart! Not this bullcrap fake Chinese trading 
@_date: 2017-01-22 14:25:08

Bitcoin is Paypal 3.0,  why do you need that? 
@_date: 2017-01-26 07:08:39
China pumped up the price with margin trading. In every asset class in the world this can happen,  when prices go up to quickly they can fall. 900 feels like an equilibrium now. I expect volatility go stay low,  hold on to your BTC,  it's the future. The risk of not owning them is higher than owning them. I expect this year great things to happen

All of this is old news anyway. Now we can focus on implementing Segwit

Coinbase alone has 10 mln or something 
@_date: 2017-01-31 16:43:01

including yourself
@_date: 2017-08-29 08:00:02
Once the majority of transactions are segwit the blocks will have more capacity which could drive the price down further but my guess is that we need layer 2 transactions to make them really cheap. Lightning network and drive chain could do the job
@_date: 2017-01-22 14:13:43
All of today is basically old news. You can read my comments, from day 1 when the Chinese exchanges first announced that they won't allow margin trading I was bullish on this development.  Bitcoin went up since that 10 percent. If I were you I would close my shoes,  segwit and lightning network is coming. I openly always expressed I don't need the Chinese

I wanted to say that the impact of an ETF on the price of Bitcoin is ten times lower than the futures. I would would expect up to 5 bn of savings in an ETF over time. The futures is for institutional investors, I would not be surprised if the open interest is 50 bn at some point. Other than that I support a cheap ETF, should have fees lower than 0.5 percent

Expect some more triple digits transactions per block when the first exchanges start tu use segwit. They should because it makes the transactions cheaper

because softforks can change the blocksize. Also do the maths, if you want to Lightning Network users. The current blocksize would allow to onboard maybe 500.000 users a month. That's too little on the long run

Nothing to do with poeple stop using Bitcoin. Chinese volumes were fake and because of the insane leverage the volatility increased. Also to be very clear, the western world does not benifit from Chinese trading volume. They still have to use the Bitstamp, Bitfinex, Kraken, GDAX and co. Their volume increase over trime. So all is good. Bitcoin prices will be made outside of China

2x gonna happen and it has to happen. Lightning is still far away. We need quick scaling solutions. Also think big: if you want to open 100 mln lightning channels for bitcoiners to use them, it would need 6-12 months with the current blocksize to onbard them. I am for scaling in every direction, maybe drive chain is a good solution too
@_date: 2017-08-08 15:22:00
Also the original chain will run with max 10% of the hashing power making blocks painfully slow for the next months.
Exchanges will accept the bitcoin with the highest hashing power as Bitcoin. Bcore chain will be history

I see it more as a subsidy , basically you can go ahead and build a bigger solar farm which has overcapacity but dont worry too much when energy consumption is not keeping up.
IMO in the future mining chips will become a commodity and only energy costs will be relevant. If that will be the case we will see a lot of green energy projects benefiting from mining
@_date: 2017-08-23 07:20:20
Theymos explained that only the sender address matters. When the exchanges start to shift their hot wallets to segwit, this could be already a big step forward to get more transactions. I can personally wait a bit before I need a segwit address. But yes maybe a bit of a backlog but at the same I hope to see a capacity increase of 20 percent of the blockchain 
@_date: 2017-01-22 13:11:35
I think it´s going down to 200k.
And that´s great!

Lol, and the reddit sub would be still around 100k. What a pile of bullcrap. This tether conspiracy is bullshit. Did you read the papsr, the author claims that the money was returned by every end of month. So the price would have collapsed each end of month to the same level. Also why would you at some point need to prin tether anyway? If your bank account is 1b +. If those guys are so successful in pumping why even print tether?

Futures is a standardized financial instrument that is traded for many underlyings like stock indices. Usually they are arbitraged quite nicely in a way that they trade at spot price plus interest. Usually they expire every quarter.
Coming back to your question: I haven't heard about a liquid futures exchange that provides futures contracts. The most successful bitcoin futures exchange is BitMex. They have daily or weekly rolling futures. If you use their funding rate as an indicator a March Bitcoin futures would really trade over 1000. When you use the last 100 days as a basis to calculate you have an implied interest rate of roughly 30% p.a.
@_date: 2016-12-04 16:11:18

It begins: Acatis's global mixed fund is taking Bitcoin into its portfolio
Posted on December 9th, 2016 by Christoph Bergmann // 8 Comments
The German asset investor Acatis becomes one of the first players in the traditional financial sector, which understands that Bitcoin can and should be part of a well-balanced portfolio. However, Acatis does not invest directly in Bitcoin, but in a Bitcoin ETN.
There has been so much talk about Bitcoin as an investment. The digital gold, not a currency, but an investment, and perhaps even in the distant future the reserve currency of the whole world. While many individuals buy bitcoins and banks like to invest in bitcoin startups, the traditional financial industry has so far shown an astonishing reluctance to look at Bitcoin as an investment.
This may change slowly. At least, the asset investor Acatis now goes the way to look at Bitcoin as an investment like any other and to include in his portfolio. In the penultimate monthly report of the offensive global mixed fund Acatis Datini Valueflex (now replaced by the current report), the investment managers report on strong figures in general - and introduce a new acquisition: bitcoins.
"In the search for a currency replacement in the negative interest world, we noticed the virtual bitcoin," the report said. Bitcoin serves as a monetary substitute for people who want to acquire and transfer values ​​freely from banks. The report literally says "free from banks."
The exact amount of money that Acatis invests in Bitcoin is not in the report. But one can calculate it roughly. The fund manages 68.8 million euros, and from a list of top assets, Bitcoin, if I understand it correctly, takes 3.2 percent. About 2 million euros would be a good starting point for speculation. In the current monthly report, Bitcoin is already ranked first in the list of top 10 positions (4.3%), which is roughly the same as Bitcoin's increase since the beginning of October.
Unlike what you might expect, Acatis did not buy bitcoins directly on a market place and then put them in a cold wallet. Instead, the fund has invested in the Bitcoin Tracker XBT, a securities traded by the Swedish company XBT Provider, has been traded on Nasdaq Stockholm since May 2015, and in June 2015 the German trade platform reached Tradegate.
The XBT Tracker is a certificate for the bitcoin price: The value of a paper depends on the Bitcoin course 1: 1. While there is no rule as to whether the publisher of the paper needs to cover this by bitcoins, or a ratio of how much he has to do. But at least in the first year the Swedish grand minister KnC served as guarantor that XBT Provider fulfills its obligations. After KnC broke bankruptcy in May 2016, XBT Tracker trading in Stockholm was temporarily suspended. But only a little later, in June, Global Advisor became the new guarantor of XBT and ensured the continuity of the paper.
While investments such as Bitcoin Tracker are more expensive than the direct purchase of bitcoins and also introduce risks associated with middle-marketers, they are a good tool to connect Bitcoin to traditional financial markets. In this way, investors are able to invest Bitcoin's course on the usual platforms, with the usual tools and under the usual conditions, without taking on the technical risks of bitcoin storage.
Bitcoin-linked securities, as far as it is known, are used primarily by young, risky investors, often with a background in the new economy. In Germany, Acatis is now the first traditional investment company to invest in bitcoin using such securities. But it seems as if the financial markets are progressing step by step, Bitcoin is no longer an experiment of nerds and Internet activists, but has become an investment object with very specific characteristics. A joint paper by two managers of Coinbase and ARK Invest defined cryptic growth as a separate asset class in June 2016 and investigated their properties. For example, they attributed Bitcoin an exceptionally good risk / return ratio as well as a remarkable independence from the fluctuations of other asset classes.
Just recently, the Danish investment firm Saxo Bank has announced the prediction that Bitcoin could reach more than $ 2,000 in 2017.
Maybe it will start slowly. Asset managers begin to view Bitcoin as a possible part of a well-balanced portfolio. The integration of the bitcoin into the rear of Acatis could be a first step for a pioneer. If this is the case when others follow, and if Bitcoin becomes an integral part of global investment funds, then God will give us mercy. The rally, which is then approaching us, becomes incredible. The moon will only be an intermediate station.

Of course they are- read the prospectus. Problem of ETN is that they are not transparent.

All of the people here in the thread will sell some on the way to 15k. Some will be very unlucky trying to trade it. My wife owns Bitcoin and I discovered that kraken app was open all the time and I am like : Wtf I told you don't trade it. I forced here to buy back at a higher price,  she is happy that I forced her because she would have never gotten back on the train. My strategy is to HODL all of them to 100k but I know I will be weak in the way. At some point I will diversify in real estate ;). But I will keep on buying and investing my savings in BTC on the way up
@_date: 2018-06-11 18:58:52

@_date: 2016-12-02 16:13:06
The idea is cool, thought about that before. But has short legs, when just 10% of the energy company would do this, then the hashrate would explode (for me cool), but the revenues from mining would be diminished, almost non existent. There is no endless supply (thankfully) of Bitcoin, that would be your battery.
Good for the few Chinese energy companies who are doing this, bad for the normal miner.

It could be a simple as  but with additional stats on number of segwit transactions.

Hi, this prospectus looks new to me. I can't find it either. Maybe they changed it when the owner of XBT provider changed. I don't like that this lause is missing. this is a weakness of the ETN. They should be transparent about their holding.
@_date: 2016-12-19 13:41:47
Agreed,it can't be much, especially the liquidity of the USD exchanges is not high. The other story is buy and hodl. It's possible that 1 or 2 million BTC were bought to hold. But again peanuts. London real estate alone gets more piece of the Chinese capital that leaves China

@_date: 2018-06-14 06:53:34
I don't doubt that those irregularities would be illegal. I just don't think that you can pump Bitcoin to 20k with this tiny amount of money. Those guys would have earned 10 b or more in doing so and can relax on an island. I would definitely take a course how to do that.
Anyway want to hear my theory? 
Tether was printed during crashes/dips. That's when tether was trading at 1.02 to the USD. The tether printing was a function of that panic. In hindsight those dips were fantastic buying opportunity. I am not saying tether has clean books and that I trust them, I just don't give them credit for being able to pump Bitcoin from 1k to 20k. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 10:28:00
That's why this pump would be impossible as the authors claim the money was always returned by the end of month 
@_date: 2018-06-14 06:14:33
But the authors of this article state that the Bitcoin were sold by the enfld of the month to be returned to the balance sheet. So what different does it make to pump with 400m or 400m plus 50m, the newly printed batch? This is just BS, makes no difference. Also do really believe that you can pump the market from 1000 to 20000 with a billion dollar? Also why are they not pumping anymore?
Also you clearly never bought and sold big amount of cryptos. You buy them up and then sell them down, it's almost impossible to make profits with that. And if they really succeeded I will acknowledge that, they must be really good. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 07:33:15
Thought of that too. It is a possibility but I think this could generate some loud outcries. The BU guys will be all over reddit with accusations. My hope is that we reach 75 percent and start writing segwit transactions into the blockchain, that could be the tipping point for other miners to join because they realise they can't really reverse segwit. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 09:49:22
With all I mean 99 percent. Why do I think that? It's human nature, like my wife that vouched never to sell,  the moment BTC spiked to 600, her hand was on the sell trigger and I had to tell her to buy back. So the short answer is: its human nature makes people sell after a spike. I observed trader my whole financial career.  I would exclude all BTC HODLers with tiny amount of BTC, they probably don't need to sell on spikes

I thought nodes are run on a desktop PC or server,  both can run with SSD. The declining number of nodes seems like the a small worry to me compared to full blocks. Do you know the max size of a segwit block and how many transactions it can carry?

With Bitcoin at 3000
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:04:09
I am not sure who does, can you explain it to me?
@_date: 2019-02-15 19:31:18
Sounds cool for a start. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:57:58
1) Bitcoin is not the most efficient ledger. The most efficient ledger would be one single computer that stores all transactions. But nobody really wants that as we would fear about the security. Bitcoin was designed to have a lot of redundancies.
2) The main factor for profitability for mining is electricity costs. One of the reasons so many Bitcoin farm exists in China is because they have a lot of surplus energy. Every 24 hours a new 100 MW power plant with a usage of just 20% is installed. Chinese use this surplus to mine Bitcoin. My prediction: in the future as Bitcoin mining hardware becomes cheaper more and more utility companies will buy miners and just switch them on when they have surplus energy (typically at night). Another example is that in Germany on certain days they have so much energy from solar power that they even paid people to use it. My forecast remains, that in the future, especially surplus energy will be used to mine Bitcoin. So Bitcoin mining does not hurt the environment.
I appreciate you concern here

I already booked with them. At this very moment their payment processor Ayden seemed had a malfunction. Basically I paid 1.5 BTC but did not receive a confirmation. Called up their hotline, of course the guy did not have any clue, also I reported the bug with the blockchain transaction ID per mail. Next morning I was issued the tickets

1) Bitcoin could run just on exhaust energy (most farms in  China do that)
2) in the future Bitcoin will scale to millions of transactions per day without consuming more energy, the 300k per day is an artificial limit, there are no extra costs for for the network to process more transactions
3) the mining costs are in reality a function of the price, not the other way, because the mining reward is quite high and the Bitcoin price too, miners burn basically voluntarily so much energy, the network could easily run with 1 percent of the energy used, but since the price is so high, more miners are running. Every 4 years the reward halves until it goes to zero. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:22:37


1) Special situation in China: they have a lot of hover dam power plants that run at 20-30% capacity currently and they are not connected to the main grid
2) Every country produces exhaust electricity especially in the night that can't be effectively stored. On the long run miners will be switched on only when there is exhaust energy, especially in the nights. 


Not sure if we are on the same page here. We have an artificial 1 MB block limit which equals roughly 300k transactions per day. Once this limit is lifted , let's say to 20 MB , we would see an increase in the number of transactions without consuming more energy


Currently miners are receiving 1.5 BTC in fees per block, this will go up in the future. It will be enough to sustain the network. The network could run anyway with 10% of the miners no problem. That's why the Bitcoin network has implemented the difficulty algorithm. So even if we have 90% less hashing power in the future (which we won't it will go up anyway), the difficulty of finding new block will adjust accordingly
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:19:26
Because I mentioned Bitcoin core in the title ;) 
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:58:24


Bitcoin will need a second layer/payment channels, the foundation for this is already done with Segwit and the CheckLockTimeVerify function that was introduced to the protocol 2 years ago. This enables us to create payment channels. You can think of bitcoin as your savings account and a payment channel as your currrent account. Only sometimes you will need to transfer money from savings to checkings or vice versa. We are probably 2-3 years away from fully functional Lightning network which will use payment channels. Best case is that the Lightning Network will scale easily over 1 bn transactions, to be hones once the capacity reaches 1 bn it is just a question of time before we can do 10 or 100 bn.


The current hardfork debate actually show how resilient the protocol is, only when the majority of miners/users and other actors in the bitcoin eco system agree means something can change. Ethereum for example is totally influenced by one person. Bitcoin is really the opposite. Very loud and never ending discussions. Change in Bitcoin is very slow, the protocol / foundation of Bitcoin was never really touched in the last 9 years. If I were to pick one crypto out of all which will change the least then it would be Bitcoin. Changing the blocksize seems so hard - even though blocksize is not really changing the principles of Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:04:57
Not idiot friendly, but some more information.
It's a layer 2 solution which could be implemented since we have segwit

Shorts are rocket fuel. You just need 5 institutions doing the opposite and buying the shit out of Bitcoin. I am sure the ratio between institutions want to get in vs the ones that dare to short is 10 to 1. The herd is coming and they will trample over the ones that attempt to short

OK, so the BTC difficulty will do down a bit. But the problem is when the BCH algorithms starts fucking up and just produces free BCH for a while the hashing power will move over regardless of the difficulty of BTC

@_date: 2017-11-05 14:26:13
This is not how it works. More transactions require the exact same amount of energy/heat. The reason why it's capped at 1 MB is that most users are concerned about the internet bandwidth and the centralisation bigger blocks will cause. Overtime as the bandwidth of the Internet goes up there will be less and less objections for higher blocksize. One limiting factor to the blocksize is also the hard drive speed. But also here the evolution is very fast. SSD drives get faster and cheaper every month. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:59:05
Many of them are hydroelectric, so the surplus energy is free. Also the electricity in the western world that is produced at night is literally free. Google a bit. For example India now has too much surplus electricity. There is free surplus electricity everywhere, it could be a local solar farm that is not connected to the grid

I see two scenarios with different endings:
1) B2X 80% / B1X 20%=&gt; Outcome both chains survive
I think the B1X chain will survive, even though the next difficulty adjustment could be 10 weeks away. There are too many believers in the legacy coin to let it die out (including myself) 
2) B2X 20% / B1X 80% =&gt; Outcome one chains survive
I think the B2X chain will die, because the very reason it was created was more transactions. Investors will panic , sell it more, and then we will see a death spiral
@_date: 2015-07-06 16:19:08
 
and this is how insensitive selling looks like, just observed massive unlimited selling

I am not sure at what statistics you are looking at. Watch the hash rate from segwit stay at exactly 75 because Jihan wants so. On the last day he will fire up the rest of his miners, wanna bet?

But Jihan is the common enemy of BTC and LTC. He does not want to let Segwit succeed on LTC, because very quickly the opposed miners might realise that segwit is not so bad after all. It's a harmless softfork and LTC would prove it

Don't agree, with 75 percent you can do a softfork

@_date: 2018-03-06 20:11:37
Found a website, so we have a slight downward trend since beginning of the year. But exchanges made that upward bump in the first place, the longterm upward trend is intact. Also don't forget people like me and others temporily stopped paying with Bitcoin until the scaling works better or Lightning network will be rolled out.

Thank God that China is not the authority for Bitcoin anymore. Since the first trading ban in January Bitcoin went 5x. People bank of China can't ban Bitcoin, they can only restrict the trading. They should be happy that the big exchanges comply with KYC and AML, they know exactly who is buying now. When Bitcoin becomes an underground currency (with possible premium to the global price) they will lose all control 
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:54:06
The 144 block moving average should normally reflect the full change after 1 day (=art blocks). If nothing happens until tomorrow we will see the average go back to 25. My only interpretation is that Coinbase tested a batch of payouts, but then they stopped.

I feels bad for all Chinese crypto enthusiasts, what they are going to do? They will have to buy the coins on the black market. Or they will just buy a miner. Cryptos font have national border, no government can't shut them down, last time China shut down the trading Bitcoin was at 1000. China contributed 11 percent of the global Bitcoin volume, Bitcoin will thrive without Chinese trading volume
@_date: 2017-09-12 16:03:06
exactly, they think that it's crowded but Wallstreet does not really own Bitcoin, nobody bought, they will all have to buy at some point. At $180.000 they can say that it was crowded

they changed the deposit addresses to an address starting with 3. The same with the sender address.

Thanks, channels running out of balance seems a real obstacle. I am just trying to get my head around that. Does it really mean that I always have to be online in  order to receive the payment? Shops probably don't mind at all to have a node running 24/7. I hope some smart ass will come up with a solution for receiving funds while offline 
@_date: 2017-09-13 06:34:07
I work in the industry (or should I say for the industry). 99% of the bankers hate Bitcoin so much and are so narrow minded it's unbelievable. Every time I tell them that I own Bitcoin they look at me like I am from Mars. Just to be clear I talk to buy side, mostly HF, mostly London and NY, Boston. Maybe it changed in the last weeks but I can only say how amazed I was that they are so narrow minded. Also I heard about one case where an analyst was forbidden to buy Bitcoin privately by their compliance. Having said that I believe some institutions have started buying in, not a lot, maybe 2 handful but they are buying big. 99 percent of Wallstreet will follow once they are allowed to buy

It's very possible that the 144 block average will go back  25% by tomorrow , the jump from 25 to 30 seems to have been caused by 1 player, maybe coinbase was testing a bit. Still optimistic to reach 40% once coinbase is fully commited
@_date: 2018-02-28 07:56:58
Very happy to see that of course. Still I am wondering who player 1 (market share of 10%). My guess is that player 2 is Coinbase as they promised the rollout for mid of the week.

@_date: 2018-02-28 10:52:16
Yes amazing. Exchanges are very inefficient handling BTC. First you send them some to your hot wallet address , then they send it in a single transaction to their cold storage. At some point you request it back then they send it in another single transaction. This all created a lot of unnecessary traffic. They easily accounted for 60-70% of the traffic. Batching and Segwit will ease the pain
@_date: 2017-09-12 16:17:19
Wait until the wallet provider will integrate it and some of the major exchanges, then we will see it go through the roof. I am actually not unhappy about the adoption so far

Nor risk moving the money to segwit, I did and enjoy the lower fees. The main reason that the acceptance is still low is because many wallets still don't support it, also most exchanges haven't upgraded

Due to current demand, read this
Bitcoin is a fraud that will ultimately blow up, according to JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon, who said the digital currency was only fit for use by drug dealers, murderers and people living in places such as North Korea.
Speaking at a conference in New York, the boss of America’s biggest bank said he would fire “in a second” anyone at the investment bank found to be trading in bitcoin. “For two reasons: it’s against our rules, and they’re stupid. And both are dangerous.”

The largest of which is CME: CME Group Inc. (Chicago Mercantile Exchange &amp; Chicago Board of Trade)
or the third largest is Chicago Board Options Exchange

I have observed trading the last 3 weeks. With good news as usual I have observed a steady rise. Every setback is used for buying. The order book looks super healthy. I have seen single bids for 1.000 BTC on Bitfinex. Just a little buying pressure pushes up the price. Every real buying interest of 10.000 BTC seems to push uo the price by 5%. And it seems far from over.

Disagree. It depends on the price of the Bitcoin. The higher the price the more hardware is protecting the blockchain. Also it's not logical to attack the Bitcoin, the hacker would steal bitcoins which value would drop to zero. The miners will immediately discover the attack. There is nothing to win for a not feasible hack. In 2 years you will need to invest around 1-2 bn dollar in hardware and even then you might not succeed

I am trying to stay rational, I am invested big time. Usually I subtract 20 percent of the value in my head to be on the safe side. Don't think it's going to fall. BTC will become something very bug, can't wait to see it happening. But also I am less excited and more patient. I don't think this is bad, it's healthy 
@_date: 2015-03-09 20:39:09
I have a theory. Many of the miners kept the bitcoins speculatively. Once the bitcoin dropped below certain levels they were forced to execute their annual savings. That nurtured the downward spiral
@_date: 2017-05-30 16:25:18
why is it crazy? The segwit fork will be smooth , right?
Then a hardfork with 80% consensus (not ideal) but I think this could also go smoothly. What bothers you?

@_date: 2017-05-30 20:00:23
As far as I understand 80% of the hashrate will signal for the new BIP, then Segwit will be activated, correct without Jihan no Segwit. You seem to be sure that he won't be doing it, but he signed the NY agreement. You may not like him, I may not like him, but let's see if he is a man of his word. Also 95% threshhold for a hardfork is pulled out of the air. I bet if 80% will hard fork, the other coin will become meaningless.

Great idea. Spend 1 bn on hardware, hopefully unnoticed, to short maybe 10k Bitcoin, where the Bitcoin exchanges will track you down. For a potential win of 1 m you have to risk 1 bn.

You are wrong, Bitcoin volatility is very low currently. It was 3 times higher when the Chinese bubble imploded.

agreed, it rocks, gives me confidence, even for the hard fork
@_date: 2017-07-14 16:07:02
Can you detect how many miners installed it before they start signalling? 
Some stats along those lines: 
@_date: 2017-07-19 07:25:01
My prediction was confirmed, we have 80%+ in the current activation period. Early activation in 2 days very likely , especially when slush pool joins in tomorrow 
@_date: 2017-07-17 10:15:37
No this is more. They already installed segwit2x and signal BIP91
EDIT I take it back, it's Antpool and Bixin and Bitclub signalling BIP91, even more hashing power. f2Pool and BWpool still not signalling
@_date: 2017-07-18 13:37:56
Why do you even use 336 or 1000 blocks when the new BTC1 software did not exist?
Here is my reasoning: 
78-79% of the hashing power (including slush)  signals BIP91. This would be of course  shy 1 or 2 percent. But it also means that it's just one pool like f2pool away to break the 80%. This could happen within the next 2 days and it will still be safe
@_date: 2017-07-19 09:26:46

Also funny anekdote , did the 80% hashing power lead to segwit2x? No because the user are in power

True, also on all major exchanges the backlog for new clients is weeks, not days. Kraken can't handle the volume of new clients, I hear similar things for Coinbase. Poloniex totally overwhelmed. In the coming weeks we will see a lot of new buyers , the ones that don't have an account yet

Those miners are signalling their intention to install the new software for the segwit protocol upgrade and later hardfork to 2 MB blocksize (the New York agreement). The software is due to be released around 15th of July. I would expect Segwit to be activated within 4 weeks after that. Segwit is the most important protocol upgrade most bitcoiners agree to. It will almost double the capacity in terms of number of transaction but also bring a lot of other bug fixes. The caveat is that 3 months later those miners will hard fork Bitcoin to a 2 MB blocksize. Many people in this forum dont like the idea of a hard fork. Even though it makes me a bit uneasy too I want this compromise to work.

beautiful! Bitcoiners united. Big blockers and segwit we stand united.

probably 5 .10 bn flooded into - raising the mcap to 100 bn. Could still be retail, but I also believe that first instis are buying

Let's assume the exchange has a huge LN wallet. Can they send it to your LN wallet (assuming the same payment channel)
OR can I send from my LN wallet to yours?
In other words: can Bob receive Bitcoin from Alice  on his LN wallet without owning any bitcoin on the blockchain?
@_date: 2017-06-17 01:25:21
You have my support 
@_date: 2017-06-01 10:57:12
Yes it could enable a lot of new Bitcoiners, that can't afford the transactions fees to save and spend it Bitcoin. Currently a wire to your LN wallet from your blockchain account would be $2, that's prohibitive for many. I also don't like to pay 2$ every time I top up my payment channel
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:59:17
Can Alice send Bob some Bitcoin on his lightning wallet without Bob owning Bitcoin on the main chain?
Would he have a disadvantage (besides security) owning Bitcoin only on his lightning wallet?

Segwit measures the last 1000 blocks, that's not very indicative in the beginning
wea re now at 66.2% of the hashing power
@_date: 2017-06-18 07:17:57
Good luck with never activating segwit, keep fighting the big blockers and never get segwit, great strategy 
@_date: 2017-06-26 23:11:17
They have a huge backlog I hear. My friend did not get approved for Tier 2 for 10 weeks, finally got approved yesterday. They are a pain in the butt 
@_date: 2016-07-04 19:42:17
Agreed,  1500 BTC does not seem much.  Maybe they do this just for one client. Laughing a certificate is quite inexpensive these days. I would like to see the bid ask spread later. My favorite instrument is the Bitcoin ETN traded on NasdaQ OMX

I am pretty sure that the community can do a safe hardfork, if you have the consensus. The consensus is not a technical restrictions, when all Bitcoiners want this compromise it will be successful. Rather than bashing the hardfork, the community should focus how to do this hard fork safely. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 14:21:37
yes. Dont be fooled by the trolls here, that only want Segwit. This is a very good compromise.
@_date: 2017-06-17 11:57:57
Exactly, a nice compromise is what the community needs. Less ego, more compromise

I am not directing my anger at IB. It's definitely the central banks causing it. I like the wording though "special negative interest rate condition"

100% agreed! The 85% fork will be the new bitcoin!
The 5-15% old coin will become the altcoin.
Watch the exchanges, they will agree, then the deal is done
@_date: 2017-06-23 20:01:27
I am happy, my prediction with 3800 still stands
@_date: 2018-12-20 23:29:58
I agree that with Bitmain copy cats. But we are at peak efficiency of the mining chips. For the last 5 years it made sense to keep the chips in China as time is money and China has cheap electricity.
News flash: they are building solar parks as we speak in the Sahara with sub 2 cents costs per kilowatt hour.
Newsflash 2: you still can't transport energy far. Guess what's going to  happen? All those new renewable energy projects will have tons of excess energy 
Newsflash 3: all of them can afford 1 year old miners which have 95 percent of the efficiency of the brand new miners.
Problem solved, mining will decentralise

For those who don't now the German banking landscape, Volksbanken are the state owned savings bank with roughly 12000 branches, especially in less rural areas they are dominant. They have a market share of about 15% in Germany.

 1942 bn EUR in the bank (short term deposits)
 485 bn EUR in funds
 342 bn EUR in stocks
 141 bn EUR in cash

we will get segwit with the small price of a hard fork. When all those core supporting sissies would calm down we can get both done and unite the bitcoiners. Nobody benefits from a split community

I am a core supporter, but I want Segwit 2x, because it's a compromise and if we all work together we wont have a forked coin

Right, will add it too
