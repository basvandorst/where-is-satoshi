insider trading. some fss employees knew about the potential ban and sold off their crypto. today the fss gov is saying instead of banning exchanges, maybe just weed out those who break law.

clearly, this video was created so you could go back, watch it and dig yourself yapping.

but that’s just you. others are not convinced in the faith. and again, Turkey’s Muslim faith has denounced it. while i agree with you, many don’t.

more than anything, the image of a young woman, hat backwards, blowing a gum bubble is extremely offensive and lame and prevented me from reading this, potentially self-righteous article.

you may be right! all i know is there’s talk of a “Halal Coin”, so there’s that!

While i value your point and will concede there is truth in what you've expressed here, I still can't get past the ways the sec dinosaurs have themselves been responsible for turning blind eyes and been knee-deep in corruption over time. From where i sit, again seeing the advantages of the security they provide investors, with regards to BTc and other cryptocurrencies, they're late to the party. They've relied too heavily on the views of other nations, also trying to make heads and tails of this new frontier. Because it is simply STILL, a new frontier. The stock market is manipulated daily. How is the SEC expected to keep hands on all the plates spinning without one dropping?

while i appreciate your input, the fact is the SEC will open doors for hedge funds and wall street firms to flip crypto into a whole new beast. crypto is decentralized for a reason. and they're hardly the blame for the dips. the dips are based primarily from asian markets shitting down exchanges and other nations backing off US fiat. 
we're not discussing the golden actions the sec has taken to protect investors over time. i for one, am questioning the legitimacy of their knowledge and insight into the new technology. one commission comprised of five other facets, is hardly the group i wish to regulate cryptocurrency. cryptocurrency, like driving on the street, can and should be self-regulating. 
by your token, why not have the sec regulate twitch and online gaming? money is spent and earned in that space. people invest in games and gameplay. yet, the sec wouldn't know where to begin other than to save the game makers from those who play well. 
again--i agree the sec has had its moments in the sun. but congress just rolled back dodd-frank. this means taxpayers will have to spend more the next bailout to save the corrupt big money makers. 
crypto is for self-regulation. the sec has other issues to face. they're not needed in the digital space in my opinion.

Again, while I greatly appreciate this discussion, I still contest the SEC is late to the party and not well-enough prepared to figure out how to regulate the cryptocurrency market (yes, ICOs and tokens, shitcoins). Take for example this most recent exchange reported by Gizmodo:
"Beyond sussing out the key issues of what cryptocurrencies are and which entity should regulate them, both Giancarlo and Clayton had few answers for basic questions about the space where they’re tasked with protecting consumers. Spot market? Unregulated. How much money was raised by ICOs in the US? Unknown. Asked about Bitcoin’s 3,200-percent climb over the past five years—and recent crash—Clayton replied, “I don’t really know what’s driving the volatility.” And when posed with a question about enforcement options when cryptocurrency is used to evade US sanctions, Giancarlo noted that “the jurisdictional lapse is probably greatest for the two agencies sitting before you today.”
I'm not disputing your posted items at all. I'm merely questioning if they will know how to help. How to regulate something that's been on the scene for a while now. It's also tough when in societies like Korea and China when citizens rely on their tokens, coins and such, for living day-to-day. I'd go as far to say the same might be true of US citizens. 
And what really happens to those from Wall Street who pump dump and flee? Martha Stewart did 6 months in a country club. Occupy Wall Street was shut down. These actions and events all have an affect on society. 
SEC can protect investors yet daily hacks of personal data happen regularly. Aren't citizens investing their experiences on social platforms? If they were to receive income/token from utilizing platforms, would the SEC be expected to regulate this as well? Asking for a CEO of an ICO.

precisely. it didn't work for their wall street ponzi schemes but they're certainly ready to try it with a decentralized, transparent system they know virtually nothing about. dinosaurs. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:35:02
banks and citizens globally can try and kill it, but they won’t. it’s not working. they’re just shook because as the dollar drops in value and crypto gains, they realize they don’t know how to regulate and control it. they’re scared because IT IS the future. they don’t want people to be in control of their own wealth.
