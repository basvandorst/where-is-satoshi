If you are looking to save yourself some fees then yes only transfer BTC when required.

You can transfer from Coinbase to any Bitcoin wallet but yes those exchanges also supply you an address you can deposit your BTC to. Once it's confirmed in the new wallet you can exchange it for fiat and withdraw to your bank, cheque, cash etc.

Coinbase doesn't allow selling from Canada. You'd need to use another exchange like QuadrigaCX or Bitstamp. Coinbase for Canadians is only good for instant buying on credit card.

The lesson I have learned is if you want to buy alts then buy them and hold them until exit points. Do not trade your BTC you planned on holding. Buy extra BTC and convert to altcoins if you must, do not waste your BTC daytrading, leave it to the professionals.

Yes, if you are trying to sell they will supply you a deposit address. You can send from Coinbase to another exchange and sell there.

Any exchange that allows for Canadian customers. I'm Canadian and use the ones mentioned above without any issues.

I use a 1% cash back credit card and buy before I even get paid. By the time my paycheck rolls in I've usually already made money. Once I'm paid I use the fiat to pay off my credit card from all the Bitcoin purchases.
