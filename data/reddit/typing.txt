Sweet, so are you coming over or what?

Yeah, Im going to say that he was wrong and corrected himself.

If they're dependable, They will either refund you the fiat equivalent at the price you bought, or the bitcoin of the product at current bitcoin cost.

What good is code going to do you, if you don't know how to read it?
@_date: 2014-04-04 00:48:53
I think that if the website gets more popular there will be more volume thus the amounts will be exaggerated, making the chart incorrect.
@_date: 2014-04-07 02:49:28
I think that's completely valid though.
 Even during big dips, I'm sure there are people who sold at a major loss and lost faith in it.
One could argue they were in it for the wrong reasons then.
@_date: 2014-03-31 22:27:34
You should be reporting it if what you bought was worth more than what you paid for BTC. I don't know how many people follow this, but it is money laundering in essence.
@_date: 2014-02-15 05:25:18
That just struck a chord.
@_date: 2014-04-06 03:29:23
I know an early adopter that traded up to well over this amount and he is 14.
@_date: 2014-03-04 05:51:37
Ha that's how many I bought at 430 last week.
@_date: 2014-03-02 23:34:09
Sure, but what's the point? People can always withdraw from coinbase.
If you're not a day trader, you shouldn't buy your coins on a trading exchange.
There also maybe reasons it doesn't do that by default, because people may lose their wallet, or something happens, people will trust that if Coinbase loses their BTC (they lose the key/security of the key. Rather than someone gaining access to your account), it's on them and not you. So I guess people who don't feel they can be secure enough, like this option.
@_date: 2014-02-16 18:12:45
well by the time he's buying it up, the price goes up. Everyone would win.

Depends on their hash rate and if they are in a mining pool. At this point you can't expect to discover a block solo mining.

Playing the market will cause it to change, everyone thinks its going to go down, so more people sell than would have, thus it goes down much further than the chart predicted.

No. My point is you don't have to know the other person when you make the transaction.
 Also If I make a new wallet address in my wallet and send from it it's the first transaction that address that the Blockchain sees.
It's not a requirement but its a nice feature.

Lol, this is a little paranoid. You can just transfer your BTC to an address in a new wallet. If you want to be extra careful, print them out to paper wallets and put in a safe.
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:19:56
1 thing. Open Source Software. What you see is what you compile. If you know about all the libraries/references used and know they have no vulnerabilities known, or back doors to the NSA, then you know exactly what the code does. Simple as that.
It's like a book with words written, there's not a secret sentence in there because all the text inside is readable.
That said, no one said it wasn't untouchable by any attacks. But it's always against scrutiny by the public (and people who know a lot more about computer security than you and I.) If there is a vulnerability it will get noted and eventually fixed.
@_date: 2014-01-20 05:39:10

@_date: 2014-01-13 23:24:50
Correct. The sheer probability of someone generating YOUR private key is so impossibly small that the whole bitcoin network relies on it.

I remember when it went from $30 to $5 I also remember when it went from $17 to less than $0.01. I've been through so many crashes and rallies I've learned to not pay attention the value. Instead pay attention to it's adoption, it's value doesn't matter, what does matter is what it accomplishes.

What about legitimate exchanges such as coinbase  selling tainted coins, I guess plausible deniability is there, but is coinbase doing anything to check that there arent tainted coins being sold on its platform?

I'm going to disagree with you there. If you walked around with several thousand dollars in cash in your pockets, not only would it be difficult for you to manage, you'd be an obvious target to anyone next to you.
@_date: 2014-03-02 17:47:04
Trading is done off the blockchain. Quite simply because the blockchain isn't fast enough to keep up with day traders. When people withdraw from the exchange, that's when their funds are moved from escrow to their wallet.
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:28:25
Sure and why not your phone number too. Lol
@_date: 2014-04-05 16:32:19
Here's are great points which do you not address:
There's no identity tied to your bitcoin wallet, every time you use your visa your name is displayed and even printed on receipts and the POS unit has your address/card number. 
The merchant can choose how much he/she wants to charge to your card, while on the other hand bitcoin is cash it's a push, not get.
Sneaky employees have been know to skim cards, AND plenty flat out steal the card information over the phone. (I've had 2 credit cards compromised this way, luckily the charges came from other states and were declined)
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:14:44
Yeah, it's actually amazing you manage to stay in the green. I guess all those posts you make that don't get upvoted or downvoted really help you out.
@_date: 2014-03-04 02:37:07

I hope people decide to close their accounts on their own will. Banks are FOR PROFIT businesses, I'm sorry you won't be able to keep your money there but I'm sure there are plenty of credit unions who would love to hold your money for you. Also many of these credit unions won't care how you decide to spend you money. So again fuck them, let them lose your business.

No dude, bitcoin is cash like the kind you can keep in your pocket (as a wallet digital or paper) Think of it as cash. You can keep bitcoin in an account too.. So your point is moot.
E.g. In order to use the shit in your bank you have to tell the people who you are giving your money to, your identity.

I think you have that reversed. Indica, the smaller bushier type of cannabis, tends to give more of a body stoned "couch lock" feeling. While Sativa, which grows taller and more lanky, produces more of a cerebral-head high, with more energy than Indica.
Also I believe Sativas tend to have a higher THC than CBN, which is the reverse for Indica

I think this kind of risk is inherent, especially when dealing with black market anything. I think it's a good rule to think, would this be illegal in my country or too good to be true? 
Then it's likely a bad decision.

While yes, I agree NFC is a GREAT technology, MOST of the places I shop still only swipe.

Actually, it takes on average about 30 seconds for my credit card charges to go through and they get the authorization and print the reciept. Then I have to sign.. So signing and giving back is usually over 35 seconds

What if the transaction is a % like .01% that would still be way lower than a credit card transaction fee or bank fee, but miners would enjoy the big fees from large transactions.
Obviously the fee amount is at the choice of the person when sending, so if people were generous, miners could benefit from generous transactions

Sure it can be faster, there are plenty of alt coins which have much quicker blockrates such as every 60 seconds. the average credit card purchase takes at least 30 seconds on average for me, then an additional 2-4 seconds for me to sign the damn receipt. Between the 30 or more seconds for the bank to authcode my transaction and the printer to print out the damn reciept Im usually standing there waiting, wondering why we still use this. It's not just about the speed though, the importance is identity more than anything else to me. When that little peice of paper with the last 4 digits of my card, and my full name are printed, I know that little box the merchant just swipped it on could have just as easily pulled my address. All the while - the merchant got to choose how much he charged my card, not me. If i were to go into a store and pay cash, WHY THE HELL WOULD I HAND THEM MY WALLET? so this is why I dislike credit cards and prefer a bitcoin transaction.
@_date: 2014-02-28 23:18:57
No the wallet app manages the secret key. If he did not back this up somewhere he's pretty much out of luck, he can maybe try some recovery software scan the phone, but it many not be worth it unless he had a sizable amount.

It's probably fairly safe, but paper wallet store where the key was generated offline is probably a little safer. If you wanted to go balls to the wall, you could create a script on an offline computer to use the microphone to pick up random noise to use to generate your random key.

Well, technically coinbase has to adhere to US Law, so that makes people a little more comfortable about their accounting practices.
@_date: 2014-02-28 03:57:13
Lol, but they said they weren't going to ban, just try and regulate the exchanges. Even the Fed distanced themselves saying bitcoin has nothing to do with American banking, and it's not their place to make such regulations. That would be up to FinCEN.

I see what you mean, but the point is cash is only held up by government word and ALL banks use/spend/invest your cash that you deposit into the bank. They are private businesses. On the other hand, You literally OWN your bitcoin. 
Hmm maybe I'm not being clear. You can insure your bitcoin to under Lloyd's of London bank, if you want that same FDIC Insured feel.

Doesn't your bank statement and exchange do that? You note the price you bought at, and then the amount you had withdrawn to your bank account. Seems pretty easy to me. Really.

Ha, how about this, if you want the gear, and want to pay in BTC, why not just replace the BTC you spent?
Otherwise, save up for that computer and guitar and keep your BTC. Alternatively you can also try trading your coins up if your willing to play the market (it's not difficult to hit your target as long as you keep watching, bitcoin will hit your projected price +/-$100, it just can take a few days)

You can't steal BTC with the bug unless you report that the funds never went thought and provide the transactionId. In which case they would have to transfer manually.

C++ for protocol. You can currently write in almost any languages now because there are many many libraries. If I were you I'd do some research about the different features offered by different languages, and chose which fits the best and you feel comfortable with that syntax (you should out some simple programs like hello world or maybe a data structure like linked list) That being said, I'd go more OO focused rather than Procedural.

That's the problem with bitcoin, too many people will fall victim to this, I know for a fact that making people rely on ANY computer skills will be bitcoin's worst short coming. Unless paper wallets and BTC ATMs(vending machines) dominate the market, a lot of people are going to have trouble getting on board.

That's the key, never cash to fiat. Trade between crypto. Like Owning gold if the gold value goes up and you haven't realized the profits, you don't have to pay taxes on that gain that's not realized.

Reversibility may come in the form of escrow, I.e. you have 30 days before the transaction goes through. If you return the item, the amount in escrow will be returned. Either way, I think it will be easy to program these types of contracts into the Blockchain.

You can't expect everyone who has been curious about bitcoin to jump into the community. People have to be acquainted with new technologies first before/if they join all the enthusiasts. I'm more than sure some people bought BTC, forgot about them,then founding out about this mess, and remembered after it was too late. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 17:26:44
it's not blind, it's about history. You learn (hopefully) from past mistakes. Getting 'Goxxed' is something has been happening since 2011. Btc-e only had one incident in the past and made up for it, for every user effected. Gox has not, for the quite few times shit has hit the fan. Reliability of other exchanges has proven to be more 'trustworthy' than gox. You're always taking the risk. unless you have your bitcoins insured by Lloyds Bank of London, you're at a risk.
@_date: 2014-04-03 05:36:18

Isn't this counter intuitive like if people use this to base trades on, it's automatically going to increase the error rate. To my point, if you know something is going to happen in the future and you act on when event happens, you are essentially changing the future so that the original is no longer true.

Why do you think it's worthless, many many altcoins are worth over $0.01
@_date: 2014-02-16 17:19:56
this is a pretty good analogy, of the state of affairs at gox. I think whatever action we see is people trying to avoid as much collateral damage from no withdrawals. I am a little concerned the loads of cheap coin that will be dumped on other exchanges when withdrawals do come back up. I hope they cause the price to fizzle to zero and only allow fiat withdrawals at the end..

Mining hardware companies don't deliver their products for months. By the time people receiving mining hardware the difficulty has climbed that they don't always make good on their investments. The ROI of mining becomes increasingly harder as the network of miners grows.

I don't really understand why they even need to speak up. Gavin has been pretty good with dev updates, the source is there so everyone can see the merges. I think the importance of keeping to as much of a decentralized entity, only the public need be up on the news. People use twitter and follow these things, questions are usually answered on bitcoin's part. It's the exchanges whom have known about the issue since 2011, have not done anything until now on their part.

Also couldn't it theoretically be possible, to provide a wallet address where the exchange can verify you have that amount, but you keep it until you withdraw. E.g. You would deposit the initial balance verified, and then withdraw your profits. That way your shit is safe on your wallet.

Still, the cost of the mining gear for you to get bitcoin, will cost so much you will not likely make your return on investment, at least not in any kind of short time. The regular GPU in your computer won't net anything useful in a relative amount of time. This is why buying is still better than mining. (The exception to this rule is that you have been mining for quite sometime [years]  and are already in the green.)
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:13:51
This is FALSE. the Site Operator DefCon stole the BTC. The "Bug" DOES NOT allow people to STEAL BTC. It allows people to change their transactionID and make a claim they never got their BTC, in which case someone would mannually send them BTC. This obviously wasn't the case and therefore the site operator took the BTC. I'm getting tired of all this mis-information and FUD quite honestly.
@_date: 2014-04-03 03:00:13
I report everything, including use tax every year. I was only trying to make a point. I understand keeping track of your individual fractional transactions is very difficult. Not everyone is in the same boat as you. But I do sympathize that it's not an easy thing to do and agree more services for this should be available but I can remember there exists a few Cryptocurrency tax websites that can help you.
@_date: 2014-02-28 23:52:24
E.g.  I put my money in GOX to buy bitcoin, left it in there because I was new to bitcoin and didn't know to take it out. I hear 4 months later withdrawals are stopped. I try to withdraw.. It's to late. I lost my BTC. I wasn't speculative or greedy, I just kept them there because it made sense. I'm at fault because I wasn't involved with the community?

@_date: 2014-02-16 19:26:08
I was semi-joking. There are legitimate exchanges out there. It's the fact that there's no regulation to stop someone from stealing right now.. It's not really much of a crime to 'steal fake internet money' (as some places will call it) some legal cases have come about, but when you do this on exchange in a country who has no comment on bitcoin as a currency, you're kinda shit out of luck.

Yeah, I know. I've been here since $5. I know there's tons of support at $500 on both bitstamp and BTCe. GOX needs to fizzle out, and it might be a little bumpy elsewhere but I definitely think it will recover. a lot of new exchanges are coming out to serve particular countries.

I fucking hate that. I had a guy who was interviewing me tell me that John Carmack said good code doesn't need comments. I disagree -- the reason for the code comments is not to explain what the code does, more to explain why we are using this code. i.e. business rules or reasoning behind architecture. FUCK NOT WRITING COMMENTS.
@_date: 2016-03-12 14:36:18
It costs to do operations the code... so I don't see why/where it would pay to be malicious, or something that spreads. For example, a loop every iteration of that loop costs.

as an instrument, sure. But when the Government wants to regulate it as the person above mentioned, it will lose value. People will have difficulty spending their coin with US merchants, this devalues the coin as a currency.
@_date: 2017-08-19 23:34:47
I see what you are saying, but 7bn people are not going to get on board in the next 3 years. I wish it were true, just incredibly unlikely. I'm even quite sure that whatever the US Governement's stance is on BTC, other countries may also follow suit.
@_date: 2017-08-08 11:45:05
..or it could just be completely sideways, but that's uncommon for BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-10 01:49:44
From what I understand, think of it like BitPay or Coinbase, if both merchant and customer are on the same platform, the transaction can happen off the blockchain because the platform is essentially just moving the credit around, not actual blockchain transactions. So i believe it allows large wallets to handle this kind of movement.

weird, bLttrex.com goes to bittrex.com for me. I'm guessing they bought the domain to prevent phishing attacks... I don't believe the screenshot is a fake bittrex, but instead another domain owned by bittrex. 
IF YOU ARE UNSURE YOU ALWAYS LOGIN WITH A BAD PASSWORD FIRST. Phishing sites don't know your password and won't be able to validate on an incorrect one.
Also, use 2FA for EVERYTHING: Banking, Crypto, Email, whatever... if they offer 2FA that is NOT SMS or Email based, take it. SMS based 2FA is easily compromised. Use Google Authenticator or Authy type apps that require a logic step (rolling key) rather than a communication step (SMS, Email)

Yeah, but Core will remain core. If you just don't do anything nothing happens. Worst case business/governments will only have control of bitcoin2x coin which will likely mean it's values drops, my guess it will be at most half the value of BCash. So if we fork and you had bitcoin before Aug 1st  and still have it through end of November, you will have your Core BTC (Yay!), your free BCash (Yay.. free money), and your free BTC2X (Yay, less but still free money).
@_date: 2017-10-02 19:40:26
That sounds fucking awful.
@_date: 2017-09-29 03:22:23
That's actually incorrect. total 21m - lost coin: sent to invalid address/forgot wallet passwords/lost private keys. Right now there's almost 16m in circulation, realistically i'd say that number is closer to 12m maybe less, and it's falling all the time. By the time 21m Bitcoin,  this is obviously a guess, i bet there will only be about 12-16m bitcoin around. That puts those numbers a little closer to reality.  However, I agree that $100m is unlikely and I think $5m Bitcoin is feasible, I just don't know if I'll see it.

I don't think bcash is necessarily a fail. Wait until CB lists it, i'm sure it will gain popularity. Initially it became free money that people had to dump, which is why it suffered so greatly. Big blockers agree that it's superior to BTC and maybe it will get more traction when it's available at such a mainstream vendor such as Coinbase.

Because it's not a rule, it's a suggestion. Also, exchanges have their own coins as well... People will always keep coins on exchanges no matter what they are told --see this post.  However, people should always be aware of the risks.

the intelligence of some of these comments is frightening. People should not keep coins on these exchanges - they could dissappear, they have. there are countless posts saying NOT to leave coins..

@_date: 2017-07-28 11:47:05
Don't you think if that was actually the case, the website would have been seized a long time ago? And If it was actually seized they would have put up the normal seizure website that they always do? Sorry, I still see no actual evidence, from you or anyone, that their actual exchange was hosted on US soil.

I never said stealing was acceptable. FFS read my fucking comments. I never said that ANYWHERE.

No name yet, thinking about launching an ICO on coinstarter after I get an explainer video. I will have to reach around 50m for it to become a reality. Still need to bounce the idea around some more before building a team.

I do agree, it would help if some people did research first -then they wouldn't get burned at all, but yeah.
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:45:01
But Vinnick wasn't responsible for the actual theft, he just bought the stolen coin and sold them on BTCe

I don't have to, if you'll help find investors.

Not in this gray market man. It's unregulated, please look that up because it seems you do not understand. you want a regulated market, go to coinbase.
 FWIW, I don't tolerate it, I keep my money in my wallet until I need to  make a trade, and then it goes back into my wallet.

I'm not, i've seen the DOJ lie on more than one occasion to get their way.

Yes somewhere between Trade and Take Out is where I got Screwed. This method is NOT flawless.

Sure not your key not your coins, leaving on exchanges.. that's all valid. However the sheer security of your own mobile number by the telecom carriers should be way tighter than it is. The fact thst you can social engineer an agent is just straight up problematic. Force a pin code, it's almost too easy for them to implement. If you forgot your pin code, send over a copy of passport or gov't issued ID and expect to wait some amount of time.

Didn't KimDotCom do this with MEGA and same with ThePirateBay, and quite a few others? after having domains seized, they just opened up shop somewhere else.

I think the reason fiat is fiat has less to do with the amount in circulation than the fact that it can be easily regulated by a central body.

Name them, poor vendor. We need ratings/reviews so we can trust merchants. Isn't this the reason Yelp! Or eBay feedback exists?

It didn't seem like the banks would not do business with exchanges, it was more like, the Banks will not get involved in buying/selling Bitcoin directly themselves.

There's about 20 questions a day in this sub about coinbase.

I just got off the phone with chase and they said there's no issues receiving and sending money from/to coinbase. Maybe your rep was misinformed.
Or that maybe you as a business is a different story in terms of being account holder than an individual.

No, there's no saying a malicious program couldn't read the whole volume. In fact there was even a case when two separate VPS on the same computer, they were both able to read each others memory.

I think the whole "who's going to spend a whole bitcoin on a sweater?" Is actually doing more harm than any good coming out of the coverage. This is what scares people the fuck away. Also fuck the psychology that people think they need to buy a whole coin. This is why LTC will rise in the interim.
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:16:54
they probably know what coinbase is. They named it, I'm sure they visited..
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:24:57
That would defeat the purpose of Bitcoin and the initial idea of what crypto currencies stand for. If ANY government or specific governing body were to release their own coin it would not be a decentralized currency. Thus I conclude even if they did, why would people invest when bitcoin already offers more as a global currency.
