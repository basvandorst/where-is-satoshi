Thanks for your help and advice.

I thought the same thing, and it's still probably true - his computer is compromised, and I've told him to reformat - but what do you make of the additional IP address gaining a successful second factor verification?
At this point, it's difficult for me to convince him that Bitcoins are still a viable storage of wealth. In his view, the hackers will always be better than he is at accessing his funds. I'm trying to get him to store all his coins in paper wallets, but he's just lost a good chunk of money and I don't think he's going to buy back in unless Coinbase gets to the bottom of what happened and possibly reimburses him. Given their silence on the matter, I'm doubtful that's going to happen.
Thanks for the reply.

Can you point me to trusted methods of paper wallet generation? With sharks in the water, I want to have confidence in that storage method.
Any links or literature on the subject would be appreciated. He still believes in the underlying idea, but he's very turned off by the whole thing and now thinks it's beyond his control. I'm hoping I can turn that image around with some information on paper wallet storage.

It is an iPhone, but I sincerely doubt he knows how or cares to jailbreak it, so I think not.

Thanks for the information. I will probably laser engrave them for longevity instead of printing them with ink for the reason you mentioned.

He used Authy on an iPhone.
To my knowledge his phone has never been lost or stolen, and he had used the phone the same day to log in to his Coinbase account with Authy as the second factor.

I'll ask him if he saved his user/password on his web browser, but I'm pretty sure he's more tech-savvy than to do that given the nature of what Coinbase is.
Your suggestion is very unnerving. He has scanned his computer a few times looking for malware, but I know they can't find everything. I hope someone can chime in to confirm or debunk your suggestion as a viable way to gain access and bypass the 2FA.

I'm not sure what you mean. If I understand you to be asking whether or not Authy was used for the second factor, then yes.

I sent him the news release about requiring 2FA again once you try to send BTC as a security measure against someone hijacking your computer, but I think for him it's a little too late. Also, given that the 2FA was somehow defeated (see the IP log), I'm not sure how much of a difference it will ultimately make.
I agree this is a major hurdle for widespread adoption. There must be a market to serve those who are less technologically adept than the best hackers, since that's nearly everyone.

To all:
Is there any sort of registry where people can add the addresses of known thieves for tracking purposes? Since all transactions are logged and it can be somewhat difficult to launder Bitcoins, I imagine having people watching over these transactions might make it more difficult for the thieves to convert the BTC into fiat without releasing their identities.

He was using Authy linked to his cell phone for the second factor.
He was using Coinbase temporarily as a centralized account after converting Litecoins into BTC. He was then going to convert (some of) his BTC into fiat currency. For this he was using Coinbase, and in the process his funds were stolen.

I'll also ask this, but my understanding is that he bought it new through an upgrade program.

I'll suggest this to him regarding Authy devices so he can check.
I believe this was his ordinary Verizon(?) number, and not a Google Voice number. Will check on this also.
