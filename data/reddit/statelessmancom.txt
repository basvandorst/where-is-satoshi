It wasn't, it's still on the table with BIP100, Jeff is free to continue to lobby for his proposal.

Bitcoin should have a lot more development in regards to how to deal with hard forks I agree, unfortunately some old clients will have to be left behind.  I donate some BTC for that.

The only people who could get screwed for not upgrading would be miners as their coins would not be valid (not likely), everyone else waking up from the dead could upgrade.
@_date: 2015-06-20 20:40:42
Now even some of backwater you can get those kinds of speeds, yes expensive at the moment, nice coverage though

At any point in time some person/group could lobby the miners to switch to a different block size without waiting for any consensus, this is the world of Bitcoin.  Peter Todd got F2Pool to add a new feature that would break 0 confirmations just recently.

Maybe Nick want's Bitcoin to fade away so he is stopped being asked if he is Satoshi.
@_date: 2015-06-19 19:29:18
Not unless he returns and resolves this 1MB block chain size issue. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 21:54:27
So true
@_date: 2015-06-20 20:48:51
I would agree, I think it's better to argue for a cap down the road then capping us now.
@_date: 2015-06-20 20:15:17
The patch to upgrade to bigger blocks is also controversial which is why it isn't in core.
@_date: 2015-06-20 21:54:02
I guess extraterritorial action did step up big time in 2010. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 21:13:31
Ok? Controversial is good, Bitcoin is controversial. Without it Bitcoin would never exist, even Satoshi couldn't convince the cypherpunks that it could work.
@_date: 2015-06-08 01:56:35
Good question.

Large Chinese miners should have the cash to be able to use  which can provide fibre speeds with &lt; 150ms latency and most of China is in their coverage area 
@_date: 2015-06-20 20:46:13
All that is necessary is for the fibre companies to believe the financial crisis is over, or maybe the financial crisis is over because Bitcoin exists now.

have one of the original in metal myself and I've only once had a problem where I restored from paper and all was fine, think it was a early firmware problem.

Pretty sure we have already given up two doublings already, so we need to catch up.

Been on the what's called the internet now since 1985 and I would agree with you, but cowboys is what's necessary for this task.  The internet is still not encrypted by default, it should have been 10 years ago.

I don't follow people consensus, if I did I wouldn't have ever got into Bitcoin because 99% said it was a ponzi scheme.
You can detect double spend attempts, just ask Bitpay about it.

Funny he couldn't predict his own downfall.
@_date: 2015-06-18 06:14:21
Chinese miners should really take a look at  they have latency less than 150 milliseconds, offer very fast connection and coverage includes most of China.

National currencies and Bitcoin work well together.

Government doesn't need to regulate Bitcoin, the core devs are doing a great job at it. /S
@_date: 2015-06-20 20:37:02
Bitcoin is both a bet that everything could go good and also things could go badly.
@_date: 2015-06-15 17:54:44
Bitcoin wasn't created with a group of developer consensus, it's future likely isn't either.

Pretty sure both of those parties live in North America and internet via Satellite would be fast enough, 5Mbps down is only $39.95 and 15Mbps down is $79.95.
Oh but I guess neither have a southern view.
We should be careful for sure on this issue, I'm not certain what the right answer is, but it should not be based on two developers not being able to download new blocks because they want to live on the north side of a hill or they have trees in their way.

I can't imagine that SN would ever file a patent related to Bitcoin, or file for tax credits/rebates.  But anything is possible.

Fake but accurate.
"Also, someone who could be Satoshi posted here. This email address was actually used by Satoshi before he left, and the email apparently did come from that email address legitimately (not a spoof). Whether he's actually Satoshi or not, I agree with what he's saying."
@_date: 2015-07-02 00:30:30
Yes, but law enforcement would likely be required to pay by Bitcoin to start a search unless they published a single Bitcoin address, with a credit card just subpoena the visa/mc/amex merchant account records and everything is available.
@_date: 2015-07-01 20:20:24
Just think how easy it is for law enforcement to get those records, makes sting operations far more easy.

Wasn't this public back in July 2016 that their miner had this? Or is this something else we are talking about?

If you get a letter like this file a dec action against them and put them in their place.

Wasn't there sunlight on this back in July 2016 or is this different?

Seems like the price should be going up in China, Bitcoin will become much more expensive to acquire in China in the future.

You can wire pretty much any amount for a fixed fee when the currencies being sent and received are the same via SWIFT, the problem is that you have to ask someone else to do the transfer.
