Ethereum will move to POS too. Vitalik wrote about POS security on his blog. Please check it out. I can't comment. I am not a scientist.

Download or stream?

Amazing service. Another missing piece to the puzzle. Now everyone can do SEPA payment without a bank account. This also means an increased incentive for bitcoin adoption.

Thanks! Downloading...

Excellent explanation. Finally understand how the blocks are created, propagated, what happens on chain fork and so on.

Successfully bought and sold small amount. Process is very slow and your client have to be always online. The client is a bit buggy. I made a withdrawal and the client lost entry about it. The tx went OK though. If you put many orders, you easily loose control of what is happening. Be careful.

Best experince to buy bitcoin for EU users. They doesn't hold the funds, coins goes directly to the users wallet. Sofort payment makes the transaction instant.

Thanks! When I saw this video, I had that jaw dropping feeling.

After this post I tried Pocorn-time for the first time. Boy, I was excited. Sleek design, high quality, built on bittorrent... Now the best part. It has a cheap VPN service  built in and you can pay for it with bitcoins.

Didn't know that. Thanks for explanation. Sometimes I look too far in the future, where everything rosy. :)
@_date: 2015-04-20 06:58:36
I got tipped for the first time. Thank you buddy! :)

You are awesome!

IMO no QR code because of the feature phone limitations.
But hey, bitSIM is NFC capable. Imagine bump two old nokias together and done. :) ...where the oldest technology meets the newest.

You're right. And that is OK too. The free market is like nature. If something is useful, it will find its place. And the weak sometimes die. And sometimes if we take a closer look, we can find something full of life.
@_date: 2015-03-06 22:42:31
Yeah, I see. However it's more relevant to measure Bitcoin and Alts in term of marketcap imo.

Recommending too. Used many times. Buying via sofort is cheaper than via debit or credit card and it is instant unlike sepa transfer.
@_date: 2015-03-27 22:14:59
I am looking forward. Excited!

I am very excited about Abra. This is how adoption will happen. Here is the Abra presentation:

Yes it can be opened. I am inside EU and eurozone. Austria is my neighbour country. One hologram on my package was corrupted too.
