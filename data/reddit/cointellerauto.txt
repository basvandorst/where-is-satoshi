Nearly the same thing happened to me on April 3rd. I always have QT running along with avast antivirus for mac. Suddenly 4 files were moved into quarantine: blk00129.dat, 777365.sst, 777357.sst, 777197.log. All four with a virus named "10 past 3" I wasn't exactly rushing to move them from quarantine, so instead I opted to reindex all blocks. A day and half later, the same blk00129.dat (x5) along with a slew of chainstate files were back were back in quarantine. This time with new virus names found. PS/MPC-Greetings-1118, BV:Akuma-A, Agiplan-1536, plastique-521.

I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that they may have just set a world record for account with highest number of twitter followers and no tweets.

Ya, Denver is our home base! We are super excited to increase access to bitcoin, and what better place to start than home! We do have one location picked out for sure (will be announcing it once the lease has been signed, etc..). Where would you like to see one?

It seems that a lot of people don't quite understand the problem. I'm sure the guys at bitcoiniac appreciate all of the suggestions regarding alt exchanges etc. But the fact is that robocoin, the provider of the proprietary software used on the machines, don't support hot wallets or alt exchanges. Their software relies on bitstamp in order to collect their cut, and their machines can only use their software (per purchase agreement). In looking for a bitcoin teller platform for our upcoming launch in Denver, I was very concerned about the built in and forced reliance on an exchange. Fears confirmed. Good luck OP.

The leaked business plan alone should have been all the butter your popcorn needed. Too much butter actually- prob need some more popcorn

It's pretty simple: the volume on exchanges is largely fueled by bots. They are trading back and forth faster than the bitcoin protocol allows. Exchanges obviously want this, as trading commissions are only collected on trades. To allow for the rapid trading they subvert the very foundation of bitcoin-the block chain- and instead devolve to the very system from whence it came. There is really no reason for web wallets or exchanges to move coins from the deposit address you send to without your consent or direction. 
Huh? I wonder if there's some way to at least verify that a third party is actually holding coins? Really?!?! THE BLOCK CHAIN!! Say no to off the block transactions. Or at least demand that an opt in/out be offered by the service providers you trust (despite having no reason to trust them) with your money. 
I will be working on an on the block trade platform for people willing to use bitcoin the way it was meant to work: letting the network confirm transactions securely and with ultimate transparency. Appealing to bots and succumbing to greed just isn't working. If anyone wants to join in my efforts, PM me.
