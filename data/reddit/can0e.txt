I just noticed I was getting hits from reddit!  It's my site.  Some of my goals:
1) I was learning about python and javascript.  A bit more info on that in my announcement:
2) Detecting the level of premine was definitely a goal.  People can figure out when the announcement was and compare with the charts.  It also shows quite clearly something that isn't quite a premine: when the block rewards were set very high at the beginning. 
3) Another thing I'd like to accomplish is to figure out an appropriate starting difficulty.  I'd do this by checking each currency, finding the first time period where the block generation rate gets down to near 100%.  Then look at the difficulty and network hashrate there. 
4) You can see how effective various difficulty adjustment algorithms are.
5) Some currencies (nibble, digitalcoin) have tried smaller block rewards at the beginning that increase to default amounts eventually.  I wanted to see if that was  effective at countering the huge block generation rate if you start at low difficulty.  You can see that it is somewhat effective but not perfect.  The minting rate is still higher at the beginning.  Just not as bad as some others.
6) I'd really like to be able to plot the charts for several currencies together.  I'll be working on that later.  For now, I'm just downloading as many blockchains as possible in my spare time.
7) I'm sure there's fun stuff to see in this data.  I'm just trying to make the tool to crack it.  There's lots of work yet to do...
I added ixcoin to the list of requests.
I'm going camping this weekend so there won't be any updates.
