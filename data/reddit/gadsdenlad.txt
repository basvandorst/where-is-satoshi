Thanks for the quick response. Just worried me because it's been like 10 hours now since I sent it. What you said makes sense, but I always thought it would get settled out in less than 10 hours. Either way, I'll just keep waiting it out. Thanks!

USA here too. Nothing.

If I decide to sell something on Craigslist for bitcoin, what's the best/safest way to perform the transaction? Given the item is small enough, I would meet the buyer in a public place. While there I would give them my public address, then they send the agreed upon amount of bitcoin to me. At what point can I consider the transaction final? As soon as I get the first confirmation on a blockchain explorer website or on my wallet? Or would it be necessary to wait even longer?

Why would they invest time/money to improve the old app if they're not 100% sure it'll be approved in the first place?

You have XBT and XDG... Shouldn't you use XLT or something then? At least remain consistent....

I remember listening to (I think) a Lets Talk Bitcoin podcast with Andreas Antonopolous awhile back where he spoke about this at length. IIRC, his point was that we are still in the stage where the protocol can be changed but the end of this stage is quickly approaching, possibly as soon as a year or two. Once bitcoin gets to be a certain size, we will most likely not ever be able to change it. Even now, it seems damn near impossible unless it's a critical fix.
Now I'm no developer, just an interested bystander but from what I've read this seems accurate. Sure, we can always propose such and such feature to the protocol, but what are the chances of it actually being implemented (especially now... Not in 2012)? It doesn't seem very high. Does anyone else have some thoughts on this?

I think it's simply that they weren't sure how the legal status of bitcoin would play out so they defaulted to saying no. Now that the tax laws and legal future of bitcoin are more clear, they're more willing to allow wallets onto the App Store.

I'm pretty that you still don't have control over your private keys when using the vault. They just set it up like a normal wallet except with additional steps to verify payment such as waiting a certain time period and n of m signatures.

I think he meant a lightning wallet. The btc.com wallet doesn’t appear to be lightning compatible yet.

This isn't true at all. You can generate a public/private key using a dice or other methods to ensure randomness entirely offline then send bitcoins to it. It may exist within the block chain but the private key is all that's important and that can be air locked completely.

And why?

Why the hell do you keep so many bitcoins in your online wallet?! Don't get me wrong, I really like coinbase and trust them. But why take the risk?

Finally someone with some sense in this thread.
