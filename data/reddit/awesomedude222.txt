Didn’t you see? He paused his golf game to personally slap the cuffs on that one terrific guy, his buddy Epstein. Or at least trump said he’s a terrific guy.

No see it’s different when *they* do it

But pardoning a crime is an automatic admission to the crime. So if he did get charged with that and then pardon himself, he’d be saying “yeah I’m a child rapist but what are any of you going to do about it?”

Yeah he’d definitely spin it and his supporters would fervently support him. It’s like he said, he could murder someone and people would love him.

But don’t you know? When he was just a 9 year old Jewish boy in the holocaust he was actually secretly a Nazi! /s

I’m glad some people are coming around to that. Better late than never, though I still feel that it won’t hurt his chances in 2020 unfortunately

Agreed. I think we won’t see the effects by Nov 2020, or we’ll only start to see the effects then. These things take time. What could end up happening is a Democrat wins 2020, recession and all that shit hits, GOP blames democrats for recession, rinse and repeat, same as it ever was. But someone not too far does need to be nominated. Warren and Bernie are too far, someone like Pete or even Biden, though Biden is just so old.

How does one go about doing this from coinbase?
@_date: 2019-06-15 08:27:34
Like...hey, I'm glad for everyone else because it's going up but then again it's like I wanna make more money too. I keep hesitating to buy more because I think it's gonna go down but then it goes up more. Ughhhhhhhh
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:05:43
Yeahhhhh same boat. Thankfully I have the savings to invest the same amount into coinbase, then sell from Robinhood and refill my bank account. Just gonna take a few days, bleh.
