You clearly don’t have a foreign bank account... The IRS can and does go after any American citizens or resident who don’t declare their foreign bank accounts and after banks, even foreign banks, who don’t tell the IRS about bank accounts controlled by Americans or American residents. My Canadian bank made sure to send me an IRS form right away when I changed by mailing address to a US one.
All they really need to do is treat bitcoin like cash equivalent (which means it must be declared if over a certain amount of it enters or leaves the country) and hosted bitcoin wallet like bank accounts.

Anyone that was anywhere close to the driver. They where all put at risk unnecessarily by the driver's reckless behaviour. 
I'll grant you that driving drunk in a controlled environment shouldn't be a crime.

Legally? Nope. In the US all you need to pass a law is rational basis, i.e. you need to show that a reasonable person might believe that the government has an interest in banning the sale of drugs. Selling drugs is illegal, Silk Road was an organization that helped people and sell drugs and directly benefited from the sales of drugs, Ulbricht was at the head of Silk Road. Ergo Ulbricht was at the head of a criminal enterprise and, legally, life is pretty reasonable. 
If anything good comes out of this there will be a push to liberalize drug laws in the US, but I highly enough people will care. In the meantime it sucks for Ulbricht but, frankly, founding a site like Silk Road in the US was really dumb. It was inevitable that he'd get caught eventually.
Incidentally, this exhibit 194943 that US federal criminal law (and frankly US criminal law in general) is way too harsh.

Frankly, I'd love to see the US move towards more of a Portugal model when it comes to drugs. Criminalizing users is doing nobody any favours.
Sadly there's more political gains to be made from being "though on crime".

The US is currently trying to get a dozen of them in jail for 20 years each.

Jung's sentence was reduced from 60 to 20 years because he testified against an accomplice.
Ulbricht was the main guy they wanted to get, he has *two* life sentence and federal prisoners cannot get paroled (because of a really dumb law). He's hosed.

Sure. Anyone *can* be pardoned. I highly doubt Ulbricht is ever getting a pardon, though, unless drugs are fully legalized in the US (at which point he *might* be pardoned on the drug-related charges).

Peetty sure he’s joked about that :P

The flash crash was a "bug", but the emergency stop itself was a feature. It isn't a bad thing that a stock market has the ability to shut down to evaluate what the fuck is going on (and if needed rollback transactions) when there is clear manipulation, intentional or not.

NYSE’s holidays and emergency stops aren’t bugs, they are features.

People already use bitcoin botnet.
Soon enough all bitcoins that are mined will be mined illegally because its an order of magnitude cheaper to use other people's computers. Same reason why you rarely if ever see a DDoS that uses only willing participants - its a lot cheaper to use other people's bandwidth.

I'll just pay, thank you very much...
@_date: 2013-05-01 13:57:17
You know what would literally be cheaper for everyone? Donating money directly. Bitcoin mining isn't something you can make money on unless you have access to cheap electricity (or steal other people's).

Its probably illegal but not worth pursuing legally.
