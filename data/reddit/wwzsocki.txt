Thanks this is good to know that maybe this is some local internet problems. I hope because people are reporting that multiple crypto forums went down at the same time and 2 of them which Iknow are indeed down.

Yes, You are right and the volume spiked in the last hours. Now we are at 6 months high as it goes to BTC volumes. So we are experiencing a big selloff. I keep asking myself if this is really self-claimed WSatoshi fulfilling hid promise about the dump of his BTC holdings?

but there is no volume, what will happen if there will be 3 times more sell pressure? 2500$?

 20% drop in the last hour. Boom, Btc will stop at 5000$ this time in my opinion. When I look at the chart this is the only resistance I can see so can't be wrong for the first time :-), ok stop with jokes because is not funny. What causes this sell-off??? anybody?
