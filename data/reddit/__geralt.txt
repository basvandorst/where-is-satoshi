we are talking about handling millions of dollars in this context: you can't afford to have a PR nightmare; the whole btc and crypto market could suffer.
This is not a case where you want a BETA, considering this an alpha stage is definitely safer in my opinion.
Beta is definitely not a phase where you should debug stuff. 
this is an idiocy created by early access games that ships half baked games on steam

bitcoin today has a number of tx and investors far greater than others, even in this "crippled" state.
It's code is not editable and chosen by a group of 5 random rich people.
its development pace is not to be just a market product, but an economic instrument: it's quite foreseeable that it must face problems that no other crypto has. 
At the moment only ethereum share this purpose, the rest are just coins that will have to do something very particular, or die.
When you have a crypyo network totally decentralized like btc proposes and programmable like eth , you don't need other useless cryptos anymore.

It's just ignorance of a new technology: tech people who understand bitcoin have difficulty understanding it's economical properties, people who have grasps of economic do not understand its technology benefits, "normal" people think it's just a currency.
Nothing in history exists to be comparable, so it's very difficult to have a correct exchange of knowledge on the topic.
On this, you have to consider all the disinformation and attacks on BTC by "competitors".
It's a new thing. it happened with internet too: people were saying that to be working internet must have capacity to transmit every FAX in the world.
Today is nonsense, at the time it was the only comparable instrument

oh well, the account accused of changing ownership is stating that it didn't. 
That seems to be a reliable source.
@_date: 2018-01-28 18:01:24
the hype is because it could be the first step of a decentralized exchange, sooner or later centralized exchanges like coinbase or other will have to shut down: that's the benefit of having "programmable money".

where can you find mempool stats with an average of the fee ?
@_date: 2018-01-27 11:44:24
it is not suggested by ln own team at the moment. it adds pressure on the dev team because of the volume of the transactions
@_date: 2018-01-14 09:33:22
Bitcoin will not be the primary means of payment for every person on earth: Andreas Antonopulous explains why that would be bad on an economic basis:
Also when LN is implemented you do not have to create channels for each of your payments: a sort of network hubs "naturally" appears on the network, that allows to merge transactions

having these kind of problems at the beginning of the adoption is surely a better scenario than having them when you have 10x or 100x the market cap.
in IT security this is called hardening, it's a good thing it's happening now

both are unreliable, though it's quite clear that the tweet contents are promoting bitcoin cash, or are you denying even that?

The one point people are attacking is the actual state of bitcoin technology against the best case.
What if 1990 people told you that you had to download gigabyte to see a good quality movie? 
It wasn't going to happen because there wasn't neither an infrastructure or technology to do so, in 1990. 
Though the engineers and "visionaries" who understood what internet could bring, knew that it needed time and other technologies had to be developed.
Bitcoin (and, generally speaking crypto market) is at the beginning stages, infrastructure need to be built, services on btc network, and so on. 
It will happen
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:43:24
can you explain what do you think happened? i don't suppose you've been a specific target of a hacker, so what happened in your opinion?

i don't think robinhood it's decentralized, what i think is that by giving up the fees in the transactions is a very important precedent in trading: you can buy assets without having to pay someone in the middle.
(At least this is how i understood it works)
It's a step toward a common mindset and market where paying the middleman becomes an obsolete practice

My 2c: stocks are heavily subject to the country economic and political situation. BTC isn't.
On the technological side: the biggest benefit in my opinion is that BTC  (Crypto) doesn't need intermediaries. grants privacy and broadly speaking, crypto will allow to handle money via open source softwares, allowing complex operations to be made with 0 cost.
software will replace banks. No more idiotic fees just to make them keep my money.

&lt;&lt; beta should have happened already &gt;&gt;
says a guy on the internet. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:50:15
in a dev environment the leading 0. means a lot: basically it's saying it's not a full production ready product.
While this doesn't mean a lot to everyday users (and many software are shipped and used in a 0.something status) it's quite common knowledge in versioning environments.
Chrome version 63 is quite idiotic in my opinion: a change of the major version number (the first one) usually means that it's changed A LOT under the hood (think about windows 7 and windows 8 for example), while a minor version (es Win 8.1 ) introduces changes but not so big.
In my personal opinion btc core team should consider using 0.x.x until it's fully production ready

DNS is a centralized entity, i really don't think(/hope) btc is going to have them...

how can they track transactions to other wallets? i mean: if i bought moved everything to another wallet, how can they distinguish this transaction from "i invested everything in shitcoin and lost" ?
also how could they know that the receiving wallet is always yours ?

i don't even live in the USA, it's just an hipotetical question

how can you check if this is legit or not?
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:57:04
for it to be raised there should be consensus, if there is not and still a considerable amount of people wants to proceed, then a fork occurs and that's how shitcoins are born.
in bitcoin case i don't think it would make sense to change the amount: it's the rate it's introduced in the market that states its solidity, and the cap represents its maximum availability. 
Changing this would mean it would be as susceptible to inflaction in  a a manner comparable to current currency. it would be useless
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:07:34
Question: i suppose your money followed something like "coinbase" =&gt; "my wallet".
what if from "my wallet" you moved everything to "my other secret wallet" ?
how is IRS going to tax you ?
you could have bought a lot of shitcoin and then lost everything, right?

i'm missing something, how can a website steal private keys?
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:46:30
it's not necessarily true that i sold with a profit: by investing with leverage i could sell at 0 and lose everything.
Also the exchange can never know how i move my assets after i withdraw from them

thank you, the last part was the part i was missing

if you want to know why these things are happening you have to study the technology behind it.
if you are investing ,again you should know what you are investing in: you are comparing stock markets with crypto, dollar value with btc value.
It's like measuring height of a building in "apples" just because you can describe both with a measure in centimeters.
if you really are a user interested in investing and crypto, then start studying what's happening
@_date: 2018-08-29 13:27:52
how much money are you talking about ?
if it's an amount you AND your family can afford to lose talk with them about it.
Otherwise, don't. (if this is the situation, then you probably shouldn't even after 18 years, i think)
@_date: 2018-05-20 09:07:20
you can test if the mnemonic is a correct one in a tool like this:
and then use a wallet like electrum to use it to generate the private key related to the public address op provided

how do they manage transaction times ?
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:12:39
if you read the post you would have read that the question was not "what will happen", but if there were measures to be safe before or during the fork.
i guess i was expecting too much. next time i'll make a shorter post to help you reach the question part of the post
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:59:24
it is not by calling out these behavior that you solve the problem: bitcoin supporters (not just investors) do know of this situation, and so this is not a message for them.
Investors instead should not be bothered with these problems: it just declares bitcoin a "fight terrain" ,and therefore a less secure investment.
These behavior are well known to the developers who are working on the core, that is the current audience to talk with about these problems: what do they think about miners teaming up, network spam and so on.
Talking about this to other people has ( always in my opinion) no value other than giving more importance to what the bitcoin detractors* are doing.
*not sure if this is the right word

reading from fork.lol it is expected an increase of 400%; if this is not enough to rebalance the hashpower this would keep the btc hashpower very low.
it is at the moment at 35%
@_date: 2017-11-24 13:11:40
i agree, that's why i wrote to talk with the devs and with the correct audience, not "do nothing"
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:01:59
please, stop giving them credit / importance: they (and many other people) will always try to take down bitcoin because they have economical interests in doing so.
In my opinion if bitcoin fails because of this, then it is not a good solution for the future. In each economic market there are strong oppositions, sometimes not even legal. 
This is a new market, it is natural that this occurs.
If bitcoin falls, though, then it is not a good base product to handle a chunk of the world economy
