Connect the phone to your computer to access the storage. There are 2 utilities I can think of that could be useful.
1. Recuva ( - Select other in the wizard and point it at your phone's memory. Look for any wallet files found. 
2. Keyhunter ( - This will need to be run on linux and also pointed at the phone memory.
If nothing is found try the sd card.

Immediately disconnect the phone from Wi-Fi/3G/4G etc. to prevent it downloading data that could overwrite the deleted wallet. 
Was the wallet stored in internal memory or an sd card?

You really need to add a transactions section to your app, it current doesn't display any records

It would be interesting if a stress test was organised and participants sent a transaction between their own wallets at an agreed time. With a large enough number of participants this would be a useful exercise.

In the stocks app you can now add the price by adding BTCUSD=X as a stock

What app is this?

I think it is now, if you're the admin can I get one thanks.

I thought it was midnight UTC too, but it seems it is 12:20PM UTC noon.

I like things like this, sent you a little BTC for it :)

Tell me how that goes because I might be wrong

Could be helpful

This looks good for UK people:

Not frozen, but rarely they can fail to be propagated throughout the network getting "stuck". With Bitcoin-Qt this would of been noticed and the client would attempt sending the transaction again, I don't know how to do a similar thing on blockchain.info. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:34:23
They will start to decline if the price stays like this

Blockchain wallets are encrypted when you create them as far as I know, the password you use to access it on the website is also needed for the file you backup

Happened to me to. I looked up my transaction at  and the result was a loss, but if you look it up and find it's a win I would contact them on bitcoin forums

 Here it shows how much it has received and when

I think Wolfram Alpha is used as a search tool in Siri and therefore it fetches the price

Once you enable notifications how can it be kept anonymous? Of course there needs to be a database of address to email/skype/dropbox/sms, that's the only way you can be notified. If you want true anonymity you would not enable alerts, simple as. Also using TOR or a VPN/Proxy wouldn't hurt. Basic stuff really.

They do have a fee, it is 5% for PPS and 3% for PPLNS. I mine at MtRed!
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:24:34
After my fairly amateur trace I think your coins were once at the market  but then were possibly stolen in the two security breaches they had...
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:45:40
That would be awesome

300+ bits of entropy?! Unless you guess or remember it brute forcing that is going to be impossible
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:11:15
If the community as a majority decide to lower the fee, the software on wallets will be updated to reflect the lower transaction fee

I searched by my bitcoin address prefix (first 7 characters) and it came up, try that

With no fees it seems to be a pretty good bet

How do I do the following: "Run strings -n 10 blk*.dat". I want to see this for myself

Maybe the idea of betting away all your coins on Satoshi Dice is wearing off because of their high value
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:15:06
Those fees I listed above are for BTC Guild, MtRed is the pool I use and there are no fees. By using slush's pool you are also a pool miner
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:29:54
 and  are good websites for more local sales. Or you can go and buy at the largest exchange: 
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:56:58
The reason why it is unconfirmed I think is because somehow you sent it without the fee that is usually attached to transactions automatically (0.0005BTC) so now it is low priority in the network, it make take a while for a miner to pick it up and put it in a block which confirms it.
As you can see from here ( the transaction has only propagated through 1% of the network so you may have to wait a while unfortunately
I would open up your blockchain.info wallet and see if it is still in the transaction tab. It may of failed in being broadcasted to the network. If this is the case, I think it would go away from the my transactions tab after a while or attempt resending when you open the wallet? So open it up and tell me what you see
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:06:12
You have to wait for bitcoin-qt to stop saying "out of sync" and then wait some more, at least an hour. The shortest transactions are usually 3 minutes for 1 confirmation to up to an hour. If bitcoin-qt is not synced with the blockchain it does not have the latest record of transactions which is what causes the funds not to appear
What is your bitcoin address? Using online services like blockchain.info you can check how many coins it contains
