I found it interesting that the author points out a study that shows "64% of bitcoins have never been spent" as if buying and spending bitcoins were as easy as sitting on a street corner panhandling long enough to go buy a pack of bubblegum. 
Yes, for some people it IS that easy, but for the vast majority of people, it is not. Most people I have spoken with in real life have no idea what a bitcoin is, where they come from, how to get them, or where they can be spent.
This is why the Bitcoin ATM is such a game changer. This will deliver altcoins to the masses, which will spur merchant acceptance of altcoins, which will drive the altcoin economy.
I just don't see dogecoin ever reaching bitcoin levels of value. In fact, if there is a significant enough backlash, it could kill the altcoin entirely.

I'm sure you really meant what you say, unfortunately it's pretty incoherent. 
Ross Ulbricht made the conscious decision to become a professional criminal, that is a FACT. Whether you agree with US drug policy or disagree with it, you cannot escape the conclusion that he set up a bazaar where people could sell contraband, which was bad enough, but then he added to it by facilitating tax evasion.
He is NOT some Champion of Liberty who was rousted from his home in the middle of the night by the evil forces of Authority who came to silence him.
I am very well aware the US government is, and has been for some time, an oligarchy that responds to those with money, but that doesn't mean the government is AUTOMATICALLY WRONG every time it does something that I disagree with.
As Terry Prathett said "Freedom without limits is just a word."

um...how is it going to affect us all?  From what I read, he left a pretty obvious paper trail so it's not like he is some innocent man being persecuted. He started a black market and aided and abetted criminal activity.
He knew the risks, he should have been prepared for the eventuality of his arrest. If he didn't prepare for that, hard luck on him.
I'm not making a moral judgement, I'm making an assessment of his career planning. The US government has been eavesdropping on criminals since the 1930s, he really, really should have seen his arrest coming.
ESPECIALLY since the warrant-less surveillance program and NSA internet monitoring date back to the George W. Bush administration.

I think that would depend on what we actually do want them to be. Satoshi Nakamoto is a cipher for a reason, and I am willing to bet that reason isn't shyness.
Bitcoin value really shot up after the Silk Road was opened, and I think it's pretty safe to say that this was not only because people needed bitcoins to patronize the SR, but also because people knew they could make money mining the BTC then selling them to other people who might possibly wish to patronize black market sites.
Now Bitcoin is going mainstream and that means government scrutiny, regulation, and incredible opportunity for all manner of people with all manner of skillsets.
Some people want them as a means of exchange, some people want them as an investment opportunity. And there is a large overlap in the two communities, so it is hard to pin down what, exactly, we want this thing to be.
And I really wish I knew who Satoshi is, and what their ultimate vision was.

@_date: 2014-02-02 20:18:04
I'm not an economist, I will get that out of the way right now. HOWEVER, the idea that "earning" is divorced from "consumption" is incorrect. 
Bitcoin value started with one guy buying a pizza for someone else in exchange for a number of bitcoins. The value increased after the black market began exclusively trading in bitcoins, thus creating a value for bitcoins since they could be exchanged for goods in a safe, reliable manner.
Consumption drives production. Production requires energy expenditure which requires compensation. This is where money comes in, be it USD, diamonds, gold, or bitcoins.
Hoarding is not a "demonization" of saving when it comes to valuable commodities. Hoarding of gold, aluminum, or bitcoins can influence market price by creating scarcity, thus driving up the price. Then, when a target price has been reached, the market is flooded, eliminating the scarcity, and the price falls again.
If you want to save a dozen bitcoins for a rainy day, that's not a problem. If you decide you want to "save" 1% of the world's current supply, you are hoarding.

That_Jew_Tom_Nook suggested hiring people to actually do the clean-up which isn't a bad idea at all when you consider it. Some people would rather just donate the bitcoins than get out in the elements (for whatever reason) and do the clean-up themselves.
Also, Washington State doesn't allow groups to go out and do the clean-up themselves, they have to hire State Approved contractors. 
When i lived in Texas back in 1994, on the other hand, any group that wanted to organize and go out to do road clean-up could.

I have no idea what that means.
As to the rest of your argument, the reason Social Security is broke is because the US government has spent the past 3 decades borrowing money from the SS fund and replacing the funds with T-Bills that, as the Federal Reserve keeps printing money, become worth less and less.
The Social Security fund is not the problem, it's the jackals robbing it that are the problem.

That depends on how you view success or failure. You don't have to sell drugs or contraband on the Silk Road, you can just as easily sell indie music, books, movies, etc.
You just don't bother paying taxes, and that is the whole point of bitcoin in the first place.

In all fairness he did space the dates 6 months apart. You can call it "cherry picking" but a semi-annual review is more than fair, especially considering it is standard practice in the investment community to do things on a quarterly basis.

I see your point and I agree it is valid. Still, take a moment and consider OPs position. From where I sit he seems to be of the opinion that Bitcoin supporters offer unfounded enthusiasm

I'm not sure what your point is since the first example in the cartoon was December 2013.
@_date: 2016-01-24 17:40:20
If a commodity (stocks, etc) has its actual value appraised every 90 days (quarterly) the business community considers this fair.
The cartoonist had done a valuation of bitcoin every 180 days (semi-annual) which was a more fair judgement of the valuation based solely on the previous standard. 
As it happens, my math was wrong and the timeline for the last two dates was 1.5 years (19 months) which is an even longer timeline, thus making it an even more fair and accurate valuation.
Again, this is NOT an endorsement of OPs position, it is a purely objective look at the facts presented. Which, considering this is a 3 panel cartoon and not a doctoral dissertation, it's done quite well.
