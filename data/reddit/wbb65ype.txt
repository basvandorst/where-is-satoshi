Sure. Marxist analysis of history being class based and being oppressor and oppressed influenced huge parts of the modern day humanities such as history or political philosophy 
[Quora isnt anywhere close] ( to being as informative as a real book, but just please read something about the guy.

I mean no corporations (and the government, thanks reagan!) try to win over them every day


Not necessarily? What means of production would even get seized here? 


Yeah, so like any country. Remove the main export and you are gonna see some economic trouble
@_date: 2018-06-09 17:09:46


I have no idea what this even means. You say "unions still exist", i say "well yeah but they are under constant attack by the government and corporations" and then you go "lool you just want to force everybody into a union dont you?"


I mean yeah, in order to stop the ditch digging industry from having more power than its workers the workers need more powers.


Ah yes OPEC nations not on the verge of societal collapse like *checks notes* Kuwait, Angola, Iraq and Libya . All with a lower GDP per capital than Venezuela

From his work called "On the jewish question" (so you know we are starting out strong) “What is the secular basis of Judaism? Practical need, self-interest. What is the worldly religion of the Jew? Huckstering. What is his worldly God? Money.”
[This] ( is a pretty good article on marxs anti-semitism 
@_date: 2018-06-09 15:36:24


Yeah and those are pretty socialist in nature. Not at all capitalist. Also they dont really help corporations when work as hard as possible to shut down unions. 
  


You do know that Venezuela didn't turn poor just because of "the evil socialism" right? Their Oil reserves (one of the country's main 
exports) completely dried up.
Theres multiple reasons why Venezuela is the way it is today and their failing diplomacy with the US is way more important the socialized healthcare or whatever

Ah yes the communist state of North Korea known for their *checks notes* wealth redistribution and empowering workers programs 
@_date: 2018-06-09 17:53:38


I guess im just ignorant as to what the fuck that has to do with the government shutting down unions (WHICH TOTALLY ISN'T TOTALITARIAN GUYS )


No its actually the industry that you are creating but okay. 


Oh so OPEC nations are on the verge of societal collapse? Then why did you say that "other OPEC nations aren't on the verge of societal collapse"?


Nice. I much more prefer the american way of lifting people out of poverty. Oh wait, the wealth disparity is increasing and social mobility is decreasing every day in america? Oh nooooooooo
@_date: 2018-06-08 23:21:03
ok thank you
@_date: 2018-06-09 21:26:21


It is unsurprising the lazy and incompetent eat this shit up .
Yeah so again, Marxism isn't just "lol wouldn't it be cool if we didn't have to work". Marxism created the entire field of sociology and revolutionized philosophy. If you do anything in the humanities you are gonna run into Marx. Our western world wouldnt be the same world today without marx
@_date: 2018-06-11 17:52:53
Well, good thing you arent the physical manifestation of the humanities.
Say whatever you will about him, but again, he laid the groundworks for the entire field of sociology. Our society today wouldn't be anywhere near the same if Marx didn't "just steal from his good friend" 
@_date: 2018-06-09 22:43:03


If you specifically fire the ones that are in a collective bargaining group then yeah. 


Ok so again OPEC includes Algeria, Iraq and Agola. They are pretty close to collapse  


Where did i defend Gulags? I was just pointing out that quality of life was wayy bigger in soviet Russia than western Russia. Calorie intake and life expectancy were way higher than America.   


Lmao i didnt even know reddit had an ignore list. Honestly using ignore lists is the fastest way to become an absolute nerd. Go polish my balls
@_date: 2018-06-09 21:45:39




Lets take this metaphor further. Lets say you are gonna make 50$ for digging this ditch. You pay your employees 20$. You are creating a profit of 30$. 
Your workers cant do shit. You have all the power over them. They can quit, but unless they can afford to be without a job or are able to find a new job they cant quit. You are abusing their labor to create a 30$ for yourself. We should give the workers the power to negotiate for better pay/conditions instead of letting the ones in power decide it all. 






I mean we can look through the other OPEC nations. UAE is really the only good one and with a higher GDP per capita than Venezuela 


Wow i agree. Its actually insane how you can look at the massive drop in life quality russian males had after the collapse of the soviet union. They were wayyy above america in calorie intake until 1991. 


No. Those are horrible countries. If you really wanted to spread socialism you would convince the US to turn socialist so they dont intervene in socialist countries and overthrow them. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 13:49:36
This but remove the irony
Idk like if you give your workers power and dont abuse their labor then its fine to employ people. Thats obviously not the world we live in now though, so im gonna trash capitalists that abuse other peoples labor and give them 1% of the profit they have made for the capitalist. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 15:37:57
Yeah i was saying the other guy was talking shit about Marx. 
@_date: 2018-06-08 22:10:35


Yeah, they cant reap their rewards if they work for capitalists that abuse their labor to create profit for themselves. Hard working people are in put into positions by the lucky few that control the industries to use up all their hard labor and dont even really get to decide how much they get paid because of the imbalance of power in the company structure 
You really arent well-read on Marx (or just communism lol). As i said in my post he didn't just argue for communism, he also created the sociology field with his Marxism theory. Analyzing societies as oppressor and oppressed with different classes was very important even to western values. 
@_date: 2018-06-08 21:16:23
He might be anti-semetic but he laid the ground works for the entire field of sociology. I think hes an okay dude
@_date: 2018-06-09 13:53:13
There are plenty of subreddits where you can discus the validity of communism (r/debatecommunism for example). r/LateStageCapitalism is more or less a meme subreddit for communists. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 13:56:15
tbh i was more readying myself for "WELL HES AN ANTI-SEMITE" because i thought this was gonna be a discussion on that, instead of people that dont know shit about marx talking shit about marx.
Like how can you honestly say "Marx was a turd" if you know all his works beside him being anti-semitic. Thats the only kinda legitimate way to say that Marx was bad
