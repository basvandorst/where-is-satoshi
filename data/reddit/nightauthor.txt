I haven't done a lot of transferring, but my statement about losing money was in regards to price changes during the transaction time.  
  
According to what I've been reading on the subject, if I used ETH as the exchange-to-exchange medium I would actually have to use a wallet as an intermediary because Coinbase does not support Smart-Contract transactions. BitStamp uses Smart-Contracts to send ETH, so I'd have to use a wallet to accept the Smart-Contract deposit, then transfer with a normal transaction back to Coinbase.
  
I could possibly use BTC/LTC , but I think BTC's transactions are slow. And I'd have to check into LTC.

How are you losing money, all you have to do is buy low sell high.

I know it's much more complicated than that, was just joking

I love the implicit joke in telling someone the key to making money on investments is to "buy low; sell high."

So many people do that, its like... 
Yes its going down right now, but do you think its going to 0? Do you think it'll never recover? Or are you hoping that it'll go lower after you sell and you can still make a buck when it rebounds? I dont understand why people sell when it goes down. 
  
My average purchase price is ~12k/btc, I have a standing limit sell for 15k.... I'm not selling at a loss. But I dont have much in there, if I lose a few bucks then nbd. Its a small weekly purchase, money I can afford to lose. But of course you have people who remortgage their house to buy btc... so I guess they would rather lose 20% of their money than 100%... or they simply cant afford to hodl.

I was going to try and use BitStamp, but I have no way of putting cash in or getting it out. So I'd always have to proxy everything through Coinbase/cryptos. I could end up losing money just trying to transfer coins back to coinbase for a final sell trying to cash out. Not really something I want to do.

Robinhood Crypto isnt coming to my state yet, how has your experience been with them?
Edit: Was using "They" twice referring to 2 different entities.

I saw some stuff about this when trying to do my taxes one year I had put a little money into Robinhood... I was fairly confused as to how to do my taxes...  
 
Now my question is, will I have to do  all these calculations for Crypto taxes if I make money? Or is it as simple as reporting Capital Gains in order to pay taxes on Cryptos?

Even op still has a bank account to hack

Though they're wrong, I'm sure they're just thinking of it as a retirement account. 
No need for harsh words
