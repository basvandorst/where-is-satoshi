Can you refer me to a few links, please?

Lighting network?

There have been a few orphaned blocks that the chart misses out on.
Anyway, the drastic reduction is because of Matt Corallo's relay network (FIBRE), which makes block propagation in the network much more efficient. :)

Are you sure you are not missing something?
You are assuming 9.7 M transactions per block in your article. Even a $0.10 average fee on each transaction would result in a block reward of nearly $1M, which is not bad at all, if you ask me.
Also, if Bitcoin does reach that much adoption, the value of 1 Bitcoin won't be ~$10,000. It will be thousands of times larger. Probably greater than $1M... So, even after 3 halvings, each block reward, without even considering the fees, may be around ~$1.5 M.

I suggest you head over to r/BitcoinDiscussion
You will get decent, respectful discussion and the mods are great. :)

Because they don't think it is needed. SegWit as a way to increase blocksizes is only needed if you want to avoid hard-forks.

They probably had multiple inputs. That would have made the transaction size very high.

The fees that you have mentioned are wrong. As of now:
Median fees for LTC - $0.14
Median fees for BCH - $0.02

Something that you can't use also can't make you free. :)

Maybe he swept from a paper wallet?
Unlikely, but possible. The more likely explanation is he was just trying to prank you.

Satoshi sort of did the same at the beginning, no?

See LTC, XMR, ETH, DASH, BCH, VTC every other alt-coin. None of them have full-blocks, yet they all have fees. Low fees, but they have fees nonetheless.

There has been no commits to the Litecoin [GitHub repo]( for almost three months though.

They appear to be CPFP transactions.

Hi! OP here. 
Blocks won't go from 1 MB to 8 MB immediately though. It took Bitcoin 8 years to reach full 1 MB blocks. It will take at least a few years before we start seeing full 8 MB blocks. :)
