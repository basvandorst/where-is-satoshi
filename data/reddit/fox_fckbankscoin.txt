Buying BTC at a price above the gold price, makes sense only for a very long-term investment of 3-5 years. If you want to earn fast and a lot, then only on other altcoin. That is my subjective opinion.

Hi,  
I was also sure that I found the key of 12 words matching with BIP39: 
From 1 \- 12
/ way / race / provide / use / cash / network / express / reveal / online / end / process / work /  
 
A green\-red line made based on the interpretation of the hint 
Picture here:
[  
The wallet has opened with a balance of 0, \- BTC
 Maybe I can lead someone to a better concept

 You probably have access to another wallet

Look at the picture
From point X / house / to infinity  ∞  all words that are marked with a green line.
Words who are not in BIP39 deleted
I came to the end and then the other way, from point X
As in the hint: "{Bonus clue: To triumph, one must look within. To infinity, and beyond. When you are close to home, X marks the spot."
 Maybe you better understand this ?

 Exactly !  :\-))

My friend
I see you are upset
With these wallets, it is so that every competent BIP39 generates a new wallet
But every new wallet is empty.
Today I opened 9 wallets from the words from the image and they were all empty.
If you have 100&amp; correct words, set a different order and check in BIP39
If it's correct, try it, but you probably know it ?
and I wish you 1 BTC
