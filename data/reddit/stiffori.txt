Your system is screwing you, but it's because of lax banking regulations and this bitcoin won't be able to solve.
When banks create money by lending, the part that you are missing is that it also creates a debt that the borrower has to pay to the bank, and in case the borrower is unable to pay, that debt has to be paid by the bank. It's not the bank creating money out of thin air, the bank is borrowing it from the future, so the bank has to be very carefull, or at least should, with the loans it provides and only green light loans to projects that are expecting to give returns or people that will almost for sure be able to pay it back, the bank is assuming a responsability for you.
What happens is that because regulations are lax, banks have been lending to people that weren't able to pay back, and because those people weren't able to pay back the bank needed to assume the debt, and because the debt was so high, the banks simply were not able to pay it. In normal circunstances this would be the end of the story, the banks that weren't able to pay would be bankrupted, their assets would be liquidated, they would close and other banks that didn't make bad decisions would gain more market. 
But what happens is that because some of these banks are so big, and so many people have their deposits on them, letting them simply close would be catastrophic, It would lead the entire economy into a huge recession, way worse than the last one, and it is something that no sane government can just allow, so they are called to intervene and provide those banks with money. That's what "too big too fail" means.
The way banks make money is by receiving interest, so the more lending they do the more profit they make, and because they can't be allowed to fail, what happens is that they are privatising their gains and socialising losses. That encorages them to lend way more than they should and if shit hit's the fan, everyone else has to pay in avoid catasthophy.
About the central banks, those are the one's that really create money out of thin air, but they don't do it willy nilly, they have an objective: to keep the inflation rate as low as possible without incorring in the risk of deflation, and to do achieve this they either create money, destroy money, or adjust the interest rate they loan to commercial banks.

You've come so, so close of figuring out the problem with a deflationary coin.
If just holding coin is more profitable than investing, investment plummets, less investment means less production of goods and services, that means less wealth in an economy. Production just comes to a grind.

You wrote a lot, but you haven't said much, what you demonstrated is that you know that there are alternatives to everything, deflation has nothing to do with it, the  what you failed to realise is that all the alternatives you put forward are ways of investing in the economy for the production of goods and services, holding coin is not a form of investing

For some reason nobody understands the point you're trying to make unless they had classes about that subject.

Yeah, I know that feeling quite we. 
My understanding of behavioral economics is somewhat limited, it mostly comes from reading Kahneman's book a long time ago, and  it was one of the most fasciniting things I've ever read, It was almost like seeing for the first time, it changed my entire way of perceving the world, so fascinating that I thought in getting my masters degree in it, but the only course that briefly teaches about it in my country is Finance, and I don't like it all that much. When you said you worked in behavioural economics, did you mean professional work, or just some college assignments?
