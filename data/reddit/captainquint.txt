realistically, I'll take as many as I can get, small amount, large amount. I am willing to spend up to or maybe more than 2k

It turns out it was my fault, Thanks for the reply, my client had crashed on the pc i made the payment from and didnt get enough confirmations.

Jeez man, what are you buying!?

So i can replace the wallet.dat on any pc with my backed up wallet and my balance will show? I dont have to worry anymore about what happened to those guys in those threads if i back up my wallet after every transaction? Right now my client shows no balance, what is the best way to transfer funds from my backed up wallet to my client for immediate use? I dont want to leave the wallet file in the client until im ready to perform transactions. Can I continue to create new wallet files, back them up, and each will function like a seperate account that i can load into a client every time? Sorry for all the questions, all this reading has me a little frazzled.

You keep spamming this link to this subreddit, one post is ok, but maybe you should think about taking out some ad space on Reddit. Also maybe you should actually get that website looking semi professional before you advertise it. Maybe even make it user friendly so people can click products and buy them instead of having to go through so much trouble to order. As it stands it's probably easier for most people to just cash out some BTC from somewhere like mtgox and just buy it themselves, cash. You're not really doing anything for the bitcoin community by reselling retail products for the same/inflated price. Maybe offer your own product or a wholesale product or even some type of service. Good luck.

I have been looking for a place I can buy them over the counter.

I'll buy them right now for 10% less than MtGox.

I think he's referring to the fact that the Egyptians were trading in gold coins since 2700 BC.

Yeah, what's with the bitcoin address at the end of the post? I feel like that's like when someone who works at Wendy's puts their hand out for a tip after they hand you your food through the drive through window.
