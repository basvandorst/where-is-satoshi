Ones that haven't quite cloned the subversion properly. Think copy and paste errors, mostly.

Clients caught in the tar pit can either refuse to sync properly, or show false low balances which can be restored using the "rescan" button in the client settings". There's no security issue beyond that.

Listening sockets and bandwidth are a limited resource. There's every reason to measure them.

Yes, that's one of the people announcing a whole /24. Generally this won't affect Bitcoin Core at it refuses to connect to people in the same /16, but most SPV clients don't make that sort of restriction. Nodes in that range pretend to be Satoshi 0.9.3 but most certainly are not. They do not relay any inventory and might as well be a denial of service attack.

That would just incentivize botnets to run nodes, making the network even worse off than it is now.

There's a mix of things going on here. Most of it is malicious actors, some of it is people running badly constructed custom clients. 
* Blockchain.info abusively makes thousands of outgoing connections to the network, for the purposes of publishing people's IP addresses on their website ([this has been responsible for landing at least one person in legal trouble]( Their clients (2) are both modified so that they don't relay anything back to the network, thus simply take up room and bandwidth on whatever nodes they connect to. 
* Mycelium.com runs a terrible custom node called BQS which relays a variety of incomplete and invalid data to it's peers. More often than not it will connect to you, relay a bunch of junk, and then get banned on the spot. [Here's some previous discussion]( back from 2013 about it. 
* Snoopy connects to all nodes extremely aggressively and again relays nothing to anybody. [It is owned by Christian Decker](
* Bitnodes.io floods connections every few minutes, several people run this software or variants of it, so it's not uncommon to see many useless peers with it's subversion connected to your node. [There's a nice example here]( 16 incoming connections and 5 of them are bitnodes crawlers.
A number of other peers are also doing things like flooding address messages, announcing themselves on thousands of ports or hosts, that sort of thing. There's lots of ones doing sniffing too (look at the bandwidth stats and they stick out), but I can't work out who owns them or what to call them. It's likely at least some of these are owned by Coinbase.com and Bitpay.com. 
    $ bitcoin-cli getinfo | grep connections
    "connections" : 67,
    $ bitcoin-cli getpeerinfo | grep "bitnodes.io" | wc -l
    5
In this case, non-contributing nodes (including blockchain.info, snoopy, bitnodes) account for 25% of my connections.

I've always found it odd that the most well funded company in Bitcoin doesn't contribute to the network at all.
