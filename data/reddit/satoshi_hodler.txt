Can Bitcoin be used as something else than medium of exchange/speculative asset? Technically it can, because you might be able to run smart contracts on its blockchain soon, you can write arbitrary data to it so it's like immutable twitter, you can issue tokens via Counterparty, you can use it as decentralized timestamping server, and probably a lot of other non-money use cases that I've haven't heard yet.

Monero is not better, it's different. It has it's own purpose - privacy, but it negatively impacts it's scalability and flexibility.

People should be treating seeds like if they were some $10,000 notes. 


Can't tell for sure, but generally the seed is your master key - it can restore wallet bypassing 2fa.


Bitcoin is like cash - if you lose it physically, it's gone. People don't go to banks and ask to restore their lost notes.


Most of the time wrong address is a result of malware or misunderstanding. Just check it carefully before hitting that send button.


If somebody will still your cash, there's no bank to protect you.
TL;DR securing Bitcoin is similar to securing cash. I think most people know how to do it.
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:27:40
What do you mean save? Bitcoin is not in danger, alts can't replace it because none of them is as decentralized, secure and stable as Bitcoin, not to mention that so many of them are scams and vaporwave like for example Iota. Offchain is pretty much the only way to evolve, it's easy to prove that there's no way to scale on main chain, because no home PC can process and store even hundreds of transactions per second, and without network of nodes cryptos are useless.
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:59:41
And people got really used to banks charging fees as percentages of transaction sum, so many probably assume that it's the same with Bitcoin. Detailed explanation of fees should be one of the first things that newcomers discover when they start learning about BTC, right after wallet security. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:20:34
It depends on Bitcoin's use case. $20 fee renders most purchases useless, but it's a fair fee for sending some thousands of dollars worth of value across the globe, or getting access to "digital gold", or making expensive purchases like collectibles and luxury. If the blocks will be filled with those big value transactions, then opening a lightning channel will indeed be expensive, so it will be more of a middle-class thing. 
Altcoins like litecoin will have cheaper fees so opening LN channels on them will be more affordable for the poor, but the tradeoff will be that they will be less secure because they will have less PoW and less nodes.

Game theory time!
Miners only create new blocks, while full nodes validate those blocks to make sure that miners didn't cheat. There's also a threat of centralized attacks that produce valid blocks, like double spending, but full nodes can agree to change the rules by hard fork and punish miners by making all their equipment useless.

Satoshi screwed up big time in his whitepaper, he said that Bitcoin will be a peer to peer electronic cash, but then he said that most users will be clients of this network and not peers.

Double spend is not the only kind of 51% attack, there's also DOS and blacklisting.
I think blacklisting is the most curious here, because it can be very subtle, unlike double spend or DOS that quickly ruin the network. Imagine that someone wants to dump 200k BCH, so they send a tx to an exchange, but miners notice it and refuse to include it in a block, and if minority miners include it in their block, majority miners will refuse to mine on top of it, effectively freezing those coins. Bonus points for centralized virtual nodes that can blacklist transactions by refusing adding them to their mempool and propagating.

I was only taking onchain and LN into account, there are other concepts and projects for scaling so who knows, maybe in some distant future Bitcoin will actually be able to handle all the transactions and smart contracts of the world.
And for now just keep in mind that Bitcoin fees are an open market driven by supply and demand, they are high because there's a huge demand and people are actually willing to pay them. The only problem is that default fees and fee estimation algorithms of all Bitcoin clients absolutely suck, and withdraw fees of exchanges suck too, unless they use batch withdrawals.

Why would you take them down? You can just silently fork them to some new rules, and SPV clients (which will be 99% users because no one would be able to afford running a full node with big blocks) won't even notice is. Or you can just use the power of full nodes to censor transactions of SPV wallets. And network topology is important - miners might have connections only with those virtual nodes, so this cluster would be like a central server for Bcash, and the rest of real nodes would be irrelevant.

If you keep raising blocksize high enough, only miners and big businesses would be able to run full nodes.
People behind Bcash and SegWit2x would make sure that 8 MB blocks are filled fast enough to push another blocksize increase to drop all nodes run by home users out of the network - refusal to use batched transactions and SegWit is a good proof of their real intentions.

For the node operator - you are getting the full peer-to-peer, trustless, censorship resistant experience of Bitcoin. 
Lightweight clients can verify payments, but they can't check all the network rules, they depend on full nodes (server-client model), and can't fork on their own, only choose to follow forks if they can detect them.
By running a full node, you make the network harder to take down or disrupt, you can serve lightweight clients, allowing more users who run lightweight clients to join and making their connection more secure. 
The only reason why Bitcoin exists for so long is because it is distributed between hundreds of thousands or even millions of home computers - if blockchain and Bitcoin required datacenters to run and store, it would have been taken down or regulated pretty quickly, like it happened with Liberty Reserve.

Poloniex does this, you get a flat 0.1 mBTC fee and 100% chance to get confirmed in next block. They don't trade against fiat, but if its possible to buy Tethers for fiat on some other exchange and send them to polo, it's a pretty good way for small investors to circumvent the fees and cheaply withdraw their coins to their wallets.

Lightning will likely result in hubs, since most users will want to open just one channel, but it doesn't mean that they have to be especially large and bank-like, I think a lot of current full node operators will become hubs, and they will be opening like 5-20 channels with other hubs to ensure routing. So, there will be a couple of thousands hubs and unless its exactly your hub misbehaving, you will always found a route. Also, it all depends on the onchain fees - people think that Bitcoin will have current fees from now ownwards, but they are just the result of the current price spike, and just a few weeks ago you could have get confirmed in a few hours for $0.20. If there will be less volatility and more SegWit adoption, onchain transactions would be reasonably cheap to allow opening a few channels for most users.
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:26:52

Inputs weight around 150 bytes, outputs weight 34 bytes, so instead of having N * (150 + 34) bytes for N withdrawal requests, batch withdrawals have (K * 150 + 34 * N) bytes where K is the number of inputs used, usually from 1 to 5. Bitcoin fees are paid for bytes of transactions, so if you are achieving the same result with less bytes, you are paying less fees.

You're right, I'm pretty sure that it's a coordinated attack that tries to show the world that Bitcoin is "outdated" and alts are superior - unlike previous dips that were purely speculative, this dip is caused by transfering money to all the alts out there, not just Bcash. The idea is that noobs are frustrated about fees and that alts is the solution because of bigger blocks, and since noobs don't understand crypto it's easy to sell them even centralized coins with servers like Iota - because people come to crypto to "get rich quick" and not for decentralization.

@_date: 2017-12-13 15:54:52
It's wrong to say that BTC is a coin for elites, because all other cryptocurrencies have exactly the same design. Block size/time (which essentially the same) is just a knob that developers can adjust as they wish. Blocksize lineally increases onchain capacity, but raises system requirements for running a full node - i.e. getting full trustless experience of crypto, instead of delegating your trust to severs, like light clients do. Bitcoin's 1 MB blocks allow users to run full nodes on their average home PC's, but if blocks were bigger or faster, nodes could only be run on high-end gaming PC's, and even bigger blocks would require specialised hardware, and you end up with the same centralized system as Visa at some point.
Fees are dictate by the market, currently fees are high because people are willing to pay them to dump their coins on exchange while the price is high, if you'll look on mempool stats just a few weeks ago you could have get confirmed tx for a few thousands of satoshis. If the rich people will be actively using Bitcoin to move high amounts of value, then the fees will be high, but if rich users will be only a tiny minority, then fees will be at some reasonable price to open LN channels. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:25:04
I think the cheap spam is done to bloat the mempool to spread FUD that there are 300k unconfirmed tx or 200 MB backlog, so newbies who don't understand how exactly mempool works would think that Bitcoin is dying.
Spam transactions that manipulate the fee market are happening at higher brackets, and they can't really be profitable - honest miners earn more than attackers plus most people would just stop sending transactions so all miners will miss out on a big portion of fees.
So, fee manipulation is a pretty expensive attack, even if miners use their own money (or someone is colluding with them), because it's more profitable to not manipulate, so attacker would have to compensate miners for it.
However, there can be more motivations to do it, like for example pumping forks. 
If damaging Bitcoin means that Bcash will rise in price, then miners would increase their Bcash mining rewards, potentially making the whole attack more profitable.

Scaling is a really easy thing to do if you remove decentralization, but what's the point of crypto without peer-to-peer network?

Bullish means that an asset is just bullshit, time to sell
Bearish means that an asset is strong like a bear, time to buy

They will not halve, if people used it more actively (not even 100% adoption), the mempool would be almost empty, and fees would be just a few $ for next block and even less for waiting a few hours. Look at the mempool/fee/price charts:

I've tested sending on starblocks and yall's and everything was fine most of the time, but I haven't tried receiving yet, and withdrawing from yall's returns error.

I think the real goal is to get rid of the full nodes, by merging them with miners into "big server farms", so then you can control the network by printing as much coins as you want (SPV wallets can't check that) and block people's accounts (SPV wallets can't even theoretically mine or fork). Essentially the same as PayPal.

The problem here is that they have claimed that Core is lizardmen illuminati organization that wants to centralize Bitcoin, therefore it would have been logical to assume for them that Core has planted backdoors and vulnerabilities in Bitcoin. So, they should have forked from some early version to make sure that the codebase is "Core-free", but instead we have the exact opposite.

Blocksize affects all resources of the system, not only storage and bandwidth, even now I'm turning off my Core client when I want to play some games, because my FPS starts to drop. 8 MB blocks would raise system requirements so much than only people with expensive and up-to-date computers will be able to run nodes, and even then they would have to turn them off when they need to use their PC's.
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:48:16
In Bitcoin's network every full node is doing the same job as some data center of companies like Visa or Mastercard. Since our PC's are very weak, compared to their hardware, we can process only a tiny fraction of their tps. Rising the blocksize limit is not a solution, because people will be unable to run full nodes at all - validations will start taking more CPU and RAM, blockchain will take more space, protocol will take more network bandwidth. There's also side effects like slowed down block propagation, which causes chainsplits, and chainsplits give advantage to miners with the highest hashrate, so you would need far less than 51% to centralize mining. So, overall, big blocks would mean that Bitcoin is not decentralized and trustless (average users would run light clients) - and in this case it would never be worth $14,000 or even $500.

BTC became "inefficient" for the same reason why traditional economy fails sometimes - centralization. Services like Coinbase and Bitpay that amount together for majority of BTC transactions boycott blocksize increase called SegWit (don't tell that Core doesn't not support it, many other businesses succesfully implemented it months ago) and deny their customers with cheaper withdrawals by not batching them. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:24:15
Take everything you read with a huge grain of salt, including posts from other users like me, or articles from experts. Cryptos are still very new and innovative, and no one understands them completely, even developers.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:17:53
This is what you get when you don't hire professionals to update your technology and instead do nothing for years.
Coinbase and other businesses are advocating for big blocks because they are either too lazy and stupid to improve their software, or because their goal is to centralize the network by using blockchain space inefficiently and demand bigger blocks every few months until full nodes will get replaced with "big server farms".
Coinbase, Bitpay and other NYA signatories were crying that Bitcoin will die because of fees and that B2X is a necessary solution, but those very same companies didn't provide their customers with batch withdrawals that could cut fees by 80% instantly. Sounds strange, right?
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:50:11
You don't realize how dumb is your statement, do you?
Core have their own vision, and increasing blocksize because people are crying is not a part of that vision. If you don't like it, you should fork the source code or switch to shitcoins. Just look at other open source projects like Linux for example - no one there is begging devs for changes, you can do it yourself.

That's really interesting, because such attack almost perfectly blends with genuine transactions - the traffic spiked due to a big rally, as people were cashing out/in: this can be proven by the fact that tx count/pending fee correlates with trading volume.
The trading volumes during initial tx spike around Dec 8 and yesterdays tx spike are roughly the same (so the amount of genuine transactions should be pretty close on those days), the pending tx fee spiked two times higher, suggesting that there's some expensive spam attack going on, possibility with millions of dollars being burned.

If someone reading this is also depressed and regretful over their missed opportunities in BTC or other crypto, PLS STOP. There's no point in looking into the past, you are not a time traveler, so you can't change it, but you can change your future, and cutting out any regrets and depression will certainly change it for better!

In this centralized scenario, when there are just a couple of full nodes that store the blockchain, and those nodes are tied with miners (hence Bitcoin servers), users can't hard fork, because they don't have the blockchain file. Only a full node can hard fork.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:26:11
And that's why it was increased to 4MB.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:17:42
Blocksize has to be increased not when the network hits its limits, but when the hardware and connection of most  node operators will allow it.
Decentralization &gt; Scaling
Bitcoin wouldn't have been worth $16k if it was supported by 50-100 big nodes.

This is usually correct, but on many exchanges you can sell BTC for fiat and buy alts like Bcash, ETH, LTC with that fiat. And since cryptos are very speculative and illiquid, it's not that hard to move markets, especially if everything is spiced with FUD/FOMO.

Hard to say, attacks cost a lot of money, but might return some profits with successful manipulation.
If it is profitable, then Bitcoin as a protocol and commnity is failing, because it was meant to be resilient due to game theory.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:05:12
That's unlikely because of different approach in their development - security vs innovation. I don't trust ETH as store of value considering its history with bugs that lead to multi-million losses and centralized model of governance. But even if the flippening will somehow happen, it won't happen overnight, there will be plenty of time to prepare.

Start a public bounty for some specific project like implementation of some sidechain for scaling and smart contracts and watch how people would be competing for it. You can choose some very trusted member of community, like theymos, as your escrow to hold bounty funds.

Thank you for running a full node!
Big blockers are spreading their myth that full nodes are useless because they are not "economic", trying to convince newbies against doing so is pointless.
This is wrong, because running a full node is essentially an ability to veto miners if they violate network rules, or even if we simply don't like what they are doing  - like double sepdning, blacklisting or selfish mining. If everyone stopped running nodes, for example because system requirements were increased due to bigger blocks,  miners would essentially become "Bitcoin service providers" - users would have to connect to them with light clients that have to trust that miners-full nodes are following all the rules.

Seems like most people don't realize that LN transactions are real Bitcoin transactions - when you decide to close your channel you are broadcasting a signed Bitcoin on-chain transaction to Bitcoin's network with the latest state of your balance, i.e. your last lightning transaction.

Do you run a full node? If no, then your only vote is the amount of BTC that you have and are willing to sell to signal your disagreement. Bitcoin is not a democracy.

There are already multiple cards as XCP tokens, but this shit should be moved to sidechains, on-chain transactions for Bitcoin, ETH or whatever other coin are not meant for putting cheap assets on them, i.e. it makes sense to put Black Lotus on main chain, but not some $1 card.

Blacklisting addresses is essentially forking to new network rules (for nodes) every time you add a new address to the list.
Miners can do it easier by simply not including transaction in a block, but why would they if it offers competitive fee?
