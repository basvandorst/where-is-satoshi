You can always send them this way. I would love to have more than 0.05 bitcoin.

Yea I know right ! I did a search for tim horton and bitcoin and found them. Did not have much reviews but I took the risk and was pleased to see no hidden fees and a somewhat fast service. I even bought it using guest account, no need to signup (I did after cause I will surely use them again if I can get back on my feet).

All the screenshots are showing BTC not BCH ?

That backup procedure's​ with 12 words would just not work with me, I lose everything and keep forgeting everything. I have a backup from my wallet that I made before a phone reset, and in the span of a few hours I forgot the password I used for it. So I have about 20mBTC in it just totally lost forever. I keep trying once in a while but just cant seem to remember the password.

Thanks, I do like it. It's easy to use, it changes the address at each transaction (if I understand properly, it's good for security) and has regular updates.
It wirked good for me for over a year, but I wanted to get some opinions just in case there was something shady about it that I might not have known.

Good guy u/diditmakesound being generous !

I would love to praise with all you ! I am open to donations so I can start the practice of hodl.
@_date: 2017-09-26 00:17:50
I keep hoping to be able to HODL, but im so broke I will end up spending it. I only buy for 20 to 50$ CAD when I buy.
But most of the time I ended up making around 5 to 10$ on it before spending wich feels nice. It's like money that makes money if only I could HODL more.
@_date: 2018-02-08 06:55:29
Wish I had $ to be able to buy and hodl ! But I can dream my meager 0.000567 will grow.

Just like the dollar coins in Canada now are named loonies.

Come to think of it, you are right, all install of wordpress I do start to have login attempts verry fast after being put live. And other site done with other tools take much longer (like when google starts to link to it).
