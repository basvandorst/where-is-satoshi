And can you explain how it relates to the "Gap limit". Does the "Gap limit" determines how much private keys you can recover with the same "Seed"?
How does Electrum manage these multiple private keys?

Give me a complete legal document that details your business model and what exactly you are going to do with the iPhones that are sent to you and then I will be the judge if it is more environmentally for me to send it to you, or just destroy it while filming to make a point and then disposing of it in a recycling facility.
To me, you are just trying to be opportunistic and make a buck here, let's not kid ourselves and where there is money there is usually no real altruism happening.
Nice try though. Playing the "green" card.

I don't think that Bitmessage is OTR (Off The Record) and I don't think that it offer plausible deniability and perfect forward secrecy.
However, I still think it is an interesting technology.

Is it possible to sweep with Bitcoin-Qt? By "sweeping" do you refer to creating a new wallet and sending all the coins to a new address in that new wallet?

There is a price to that "protection". You pay for that protection with interest money that does not exist. Credit card companies have no problem paying for fraud with credit card because they already made a shit load of money off of the interests and fees they charge to merchants, for moving around money that does not exist. The merchants send you back that bill by raising his retail prices.
You're being exploited and you say that being raped is much safer then not being raped because you are not familiar with the reality of not being raped and that scares you.
It's sad. Very sad.

I'm patiently waiting for Ubuntu support for Nexus 5. Going to get rid of Android or simply not use it and go for Ubuntu on my phone as soon as possible.
Hell, even the blackphone (supposedly for privacy freaks) is based on Google stuff... I mean c'mon.

How do you import the private key in the new client?

Destroying iPhones sends out a way more powerful message.

I remember reading an article saying that people were importing other people wallet (private keys) trying different combination of words. 
Article mentions that somehow, pass phrase are unique, so if many people use the same pass phrase, their wallet will be linked together or something like that.
I unfortunately can't retrieve the link to that article. I wish that I am incorrect and that I read wrong or that it is simply false information being circulated.

How much MintChip will be emitted at first and then how much over it's lifetime? Will it be finite like Bitcoins?
Because even if it is back 1 to 1, if it is not finite, it will remain subject to inflation and it's value will diminish over time.
However I like the fact that it sidetrack fractional banking. Could it be an attempt from the government to slowly get rid of banks which became an unleashed evil that took a life of its own over time.
Anyways, interesting stuff, keep posting if you have more info. I'm upvoting.
