I was unable to buy ("deposit") for a few days, but eventually whatever issue was fixed.  It's a pretty new service, so some issues should be expected.
From what I can tell, the transfers aren't "instant" like verified-user Coinbase transactions are.  They'll (presumably) credit BTC to your account when the charges to your bank or card go through. Though I suppose I can't be sure yet; my deposits are pending too since the successful deposits occurring yesterday.

It doesn't seem crazy to me, which is better than 95% of all the other speculation going on.  It's also nice to see somebody admit it's a "guess."  I certainly hope they end up paying out to all their users.  If Karpeles built himself a comfortable road out of the community as well, we're all better off for it, it seems.

I agree with but I would still recommend moving them out of Coinbase just in case Coinbase gets shut down someday (for example).
Just set up an account at  or install [Mycelium]( on an android phone and move them there slowly and carefully (double-check the send-to address a LOT). It will also help get you familiar with sending/spending.
At least with blockchain.info, your wallet is auto-encrypted and emailed to you as a backup, so if they fail or shut down you can recover your coins.  Supposedly they don't have access to your private keys, so they can't steal your coin even if they wanted to.  Their Android app is pretty nice too, and iPhone app should be back sometime soon, I imagine.
Mycelium will try to walk you through backing up as well.  It's pretty user-friendly, it will basically generate a PDF for you and you can save it to Dropbox/Google Drive or whatever.
If you need any help with this stuff, feel free to PM me  (or continue in this thread) and I'll be happy to give advice/help out.

It's not exactly "positive," but rather a reasonably well-researched and balanced reporting about bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-02-21 09:03:30
Basically, MtGox has disabled transfer OUT on the software side (while leaving transfer IN operational, I guess.)  You simply cannot transfer your bitcoin out because their "system" won't allow you to.  You'll tell it to send the BTC, and it will tell you that you can't.  Or something similar; luckily I never used them.
@_date: 2014-12-08 20:04:16
I think the developers are focusing on making sure that the "back end" is working well.  I'd bet they actually don't want loads of users yet...
Something could go wrong, like a bug in the code, and they don't want their first headline to read "OpenBazaar loses thousands of users' bitcoins" or something like that.
Easy-to-use installers will probably come about later, once developers are satisfied their software can hold up to some abuse, both purposeful and accidental. I think on their website they say they're aiming for a 2015 release.

I generally agree with what you're saying, but...
a significant, real, and tangible cost was borne by the likes of The hundreds of DOGE we toss around at each other all day is one thing, but funding the Jamaican bobsled team, the NASCAR sponsorship, our efforts with doge4water cost real money.  In my opinion the successful funding of these efforts is not simply a case of the ready availability of hundreds/thousands of doge (as in the relative cheapness of one doge). Something else is afoot - something not easily describable - something awesome.
full disclosure: i'm invested in (in order) in BTC, DOGE, and DRK.

If it makes you feel any better I sometimes consider grabbing some goxcoin on bitcoinbuilder.  I don't think I will, but many others have.
It's possible that some big company will do a sort of "angel investment" and buyout MtGox and bail out the users.  Not really likely, but possible.
It's also possible that they can work with other exchanges/big holders quietly doing a bunch of insider trading until they're solvent again.  The rising price of bitcoin would help them do this I think, as BTC &gt; GOXBTC, it's easier to arbitrage.  I should say that my understanding of markets, BTC, and arbitrage is limited, and I could be very wrong (corrections welcome).
This will be really difficult with all the interference from the Japanese and US governments, but the 'say nothing' strategy would be absolutely essential for it to work.  So if you want a reason to hope, you can try that one on.

DRK (DarkCoin) is a privacy-minded cryptocurrency, the main feature of which is that coins will be automatically "mixed" when sent so it's nearly impossible for an outside entity to determine who's paying who or even how much is being paid out/in by any of the participants.  If I'm quite honest, I think this will eventually be brought into Bitcoin, whether in the core code or as new wallets emulate that feature of DarkWallet (Bitcoin Wallet, not DRK Wallet).  Either way it struck me as an innovative coin and that's why I like it.

@_date: 2014-10-27 19:14:08
I'll take a stab at this one.  If your version of Mycelium had you back up with a 'master seed' of something like 12 words, then it's an HD wallet and you don't have to do anything to make it HD, the old (non-HD) Mycelium wallet had you make a PDF with a QR code and a long string of letters and save that to Dropbox/Google Drive or somesuch.
If you are like the vast majority of people, you probably never need to see the private key itself.  I'd bet it's by design that you don't see the private keys, or at least not easily, partly to protect people from themselves.  I think I remember some story from long ago where someone showed their private key's QR code on the news and all the bitcoin in that wallet was "stolen" within minutes.  As far as I understand, it *could* happen, even if it didn't. =)
Make sense?
Others: please post corrections if I got something wrong.
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:29:37
Yeah, that's why I say it's not likely.  It would make for a lot of good press and probably help drive up the price of BTC in the long-long-run, but I too have my doubts that many see either as worth $400 million in BTC at the moment.
If I'm not mistaken, though, big bailouts have happened before in the bitcoin world.

Good luck.  I hope you can get your coins out but I don't think MtGox is going to survive in the long run unless they get it together really soon and keep it together for a long time.  The second they come back (if they do) there's going to be an old-fashioned "run on the bank." If you're lucky, they're pulling together the funds to survive that.

1. Yeah, in my experience, as soon as bitcoin is received to the address displayed when you start up the app, the displayed address changes and the 'private keys' displayed in the "accounts" tab is incremented by one.  For example, I sent myself bitcoin 3 times from another wallet, and each time the QR code in the app changed almost instantly, and now the "accounts" tab shows "3 private keys"
2. I'm not sure about this one, but I think the single address option is there to provide backward compatibility for users of the old (non-HD) Mycelium wallet so they wouldn't lose access to their bitcoin when upgrading.  Maybe it also facilitates cold storage use, but I'm not sure.
3. Is trading with Mycelium safe? I'm sure the answer is "it depends." I haven't tried it myself, but if I were to try it, I would definitely start with low amounts of fiat or bitcoin that wouldn't be a disaster to lose.  An overview of how the system is supposed to work is available here:

The situation at One Laptop per Child is complicated... rumors abound about whether it's going bankrupt or turning into an effectively for-profit for-1st-world venture with the [XO Tablet]( being available at places like Wal-Mart and few orders for new laptops coming in for developing-world deployments.  Nobody's really sure what's happening as far as I can tell, as is somewhat illustrated by [this Gizmodo article.](
Funny enough, a lot of the problems arose due to the centralized nature of the OLPC office, governments, and Departments of Education. Much of the "OLPC Community" has moved toward a decentralized approach, with different groups doing different things with whatever laptops they can get ahold of without "official" support.  I volunteer with one of those offshoot groups, ["Unleash Kids"]( that basically sets up and supports computer clubs in schools and orphanages in Haiti.  To check out other groups, you can see an aggregate blog at [planet.laptop.org]( or browse available blogs via map at [olpcMAP.net](
It might be possible to hook up with a few of these groups and convince them to put BTC or DOGE wallets on the laptops.  The XO Laptops run Fedora with [Sugar OS]( on top.  The tablets (though I don't personally know of any deployments that use them) run Android.

Mtgox apparently recently announced that they found 200k of the missing 750k. One would hope they distribute these coins amongst those who have btc stuck in Gox evenly based on the amount each user had. So if you had one btc , you should get roughly 0.2btc in withdrawable funds, assuming no more btc is found and we ignore fiat balances.

I don't think they mine.  In any case, it's not their main business.  Their main business is just the buying and selling of bitcoin.  At the moment, they allow you to buy bitcoin, but not sell it.  It's stuck in THEIR WALLET (which you sort of 'rent' from them with your account) and at the moment they're refusing to transfer it out.
Imagine you rent locker space at a bank and keep gold in there. The bank keeps your key for you, when you want to get some of your gold out, they go and unlock the locker for you.  Then you go to the bank one day and they simply say "no, we won't unlock the locker for you today due to technical difficulties and security concerns."  That's sort of what's happening.  Does that help?
edit: I guess in this analogy you can also buy gold from the bank, but they will only put it in your locker to withdraw later (under normal circumstances), and right now you can buy gold, if you trust them to put it in your locker AND trust them to eventually unlock it for you.

That way the account holder is notified that *someone* is trying to close the account and only a person in control of the email address can actually close it.
Or at a very minimum, manually send an email saying "reply to this email with subject 'close my account'" to close the account (and put some kind of unique identifier in the message body that 'bad guys' won't be able to guess.)

You certainly don't have to register with a government or anything in order to mine BTC.  You might *want* to register with a mining pool so that you have a better chance of 'finding' a block.  A mining pool is just a group of people who participate in distributed mining, usually led by some single entity controlling payouts. If a block is found, the 50/25/12.5 BTC are distributed among the contributers instead of given to one person.  Registration is pretty much like creating an account on reddit, usually not requiring much more than an email address and a bitcoin receiving address.
All of this is generally moot now, unless you want to shell out thousands of USD for special mining computers (ASICs).

It wasn't a "bitcoin flaw" per se.  It was, in simple terms, bad programming.
Something like this, maybe:
1. You ask your bank, Bank A, to send $100 to Bank B, account 
2. You edit the transaction at Bank B so the money goes to a different account. (this is the hacking part)
3. Bank A calls Bank B and asks "Did Account  just get a deposit of $100?"
4. Bank B replies "Nope.  No deposit from Bank A to Account 
5. Bank A !!assumes the transaction failed!!, and resends $100 to Account   (this is bad programming)
6.  You just "double withdrew" $100 from Bank A.  From $100 in Bank A you now have $200 in Bank B.  That's great for you, but man does it suck for the users of Bank A who will suffer that loss.
Supposedly this had been going on for years.  Who knows.  But the story goes that eventually Bank A (MtGox) ran out of money, did a bunch of shady stuff to try to stay afloat, and crashed the whole market (briefly) once it was clear they couldn't fix the situation.
(edit: some clarification in point 6.)

I haven't been to Africa, but I have been to Haiti, and I have to tell you, it's going to be hard to compete with cash for quite some time, even though it seems like every Haitian teenager has a cell phone.
Practically all transactions are made in cash; using bitcoin would add several layers of obscurity, difficulty, and time to each transaction.  Integration into the developing world would probably have to be done through the NPOs and such that work there.
Here's one approach that might work on a small scale: start or find an organization that provides very cheap meals to a developing-world village/town.  Convince said organization to accept bitcoin donations from the developed world.  Issue bits as tokens and accept them in exchange for meals.  Start accepting bits for clothes and other goods.  Start offering to pay for 'volunteer' work with bits.  See of it catches on =)  May work, or may not.

Here are the big benefits cash has over bitcoin, at the moment, in the developing world, as best I understand it...
1. Cash transactions are literally instant.
2. With cash, there's no need to know which phone numbers are "real" Bitcoin SMS numbers and which numbers are scammers (assuming SMS-based bitcoin usage).
3. It's never really unclear how much your cash is worth.
4. Everyone accepts cash already and there's no overhead cost, in time or money, to accepting cash or learning to accept cash.
5. Using cash, nobody has to know anything about technology or have a phone.
6. Cash doesn't depend on any network being up, and/or people having their phones charged.
7. It doesn't cost anything to check how much cash you have (you may have to pay SMS fees to check with SMS-based bitcoin).
8. It doesn't cost anything to "buy" cash (whereas bitcoin would be sold at a profit surely, and so bought at a loss).
9. It doesn't cost anything (transaction fee) to transfer cash from one person to another.  (It's just a couple cents to many of us, but something like 10 transaction fees would buy a bag of water in Port-au-Prince).
10. Cash doesn't require any secondary device to enable value transfer (whereas bitcoin requires a phone or other technology).
In Haiti, a lot of transactions are done by street vendor.  When it's busy for them, they're passing soda or water and cash back and forth several times per minute.  Taking out a phone and scanning QR codes or checking SMS confirmations is going to interrupt the flow of their business and in practice, is simply going to be less convenient for both parties than a quick, low-tech cash transaction.
Larger stores have to worry about keeping records and paying taxes, and will likely shy away from adding complexity to their existing system, especially when it's not easy to convert back into cash (bitpay.ht, anyone?)... some (many?) of them don't even accept credit cards (yet).
While I was in Haiti, the cell networks were not terribly reliable and the electrical grid was off and on at random times (it's supposed to be on like 4 hours per day at certain times I think, but that was hit and miss).  It's not such a big deal if your SMS inviting your friend to meet you at the park later takes an hour or two to get sent, but when people are doing business they're going to tend toward the simplest, most convenient and cheapest solution, and bitcoin loses in all three areas right now, at least in the developing world.
The best thing you could do, probably, is go there and try to help expand the electrical grid with safety and long-term reliability in mind.

Here, as far as I've found: 
When I tried to watch something there, it asked me to "sign in to my TV provider."  Hope there's a more sensible way to watch, like, maybe view-by-bitcoin-payment?

Uber could have you pre-pay the estimated fare, refund the difference if the estimate was too high, and still require riders to have a CC as a backup payment method in case the estimated fare is too low and not enough BTC was paid.
So let's say the estimate is $50, you pay your $50, you ride $60 worth of distance, you get a message saying pay $10 to this BTC address or we'll charge your card.  It might not be the best system ever, but it would work, I think.
Uber could even incentivize BTC payments by giving a small discount for pre-paid BTC fares.

Just addressing a small part of your comment here, but things like multisig will eventually allow programatic trustless escrow systems to be developed, which will eventually help on the consumer protection front and hopefully make 'insured money' less necessary (or unnecessary).

I'm aware of at least one service trying to do this: 
Its a cool idea, though I wonder what's needed to prevent fraud when all you might need to do to fool most people is have someone send a text on your behalf that looks like (but isn't) confirmation of payment. You get the goods and they don't actually get paid, just a fake confirmation... Maybe that's solved already?

Many wallets (including Mycelium) generate a passphrase you can use to restore your wallet on a different device, exactly for such cases.

Off topic, perhaps, but that's a great example of the logical fallacy 'denying the antecedent.'
[If x is NOT a link from a suspicious user, then you should NOT click on it]
isn't logically equivalent to 
[if x is a link from a suspicious user, you should click on it]
Or in logical notation:
Sx -&gt; Cx
can't be derived from
~Sx -&gt; ~Cx

The system is meant to be self-supporting and not require any managing entity.  If a time comes where we're facing serious issues with incentives, it probably means the protocol and/or software needs to change, or that a better-suited altcoin will soon prevail.

I like the idea generally, but as for including your plate# as a public note, I wouldn't be a fan of having who I am, when I parked, and where, sitting on the blockchain for any wacko to see.  Eventually, some murderous stalker will find their victim that way.

I can't tell if you're asking seriously or ironically, but in case you didn't know China recently declared digital currencies as commodities like physical assets, which may be interpreted as a tacit declaration that Bitcoin is legal to buy. At least, that's my understanding.

The situation I'm imagining doesn't require any hacking.  Let's say A is (edit: *leaving*) abusive spouse B.
* A takes the car and parks in front of a friend's apartment.
* B sees the car is missing and starts looking at bitcoin addresses where they've parked before, one by one, in B's transaction history.
* B finds the public note with the license plate B recognizes as B's
* B looks at text messages / scheduling to figure out where they were when B last paid to that address.
* B can now infer that the car is at Location X.
Worse, somebody could start keeping a public database of which bitcoin addresses correspond to which streets and automatically logging every time someone parks at any watched address and make it searchable.  (similar to this  ).
Simply having network-connected parking meters that generate new bitcoin addresses each time would help, but that plus some kind of obfuscation of the license plate number would be better.
Or perhaps you go to a Pay Station, push a button, it prints a paper QR code which you pay to, and you put that on your dashboard.
