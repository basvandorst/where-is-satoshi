I have a few mBTC on a BI wallet. At least I think I have them. At this point I don't know what to do. Should I log in and transfer them out? Will that be safe? Should I wake for code fixes first?  Transfer them to where? I'm not savvy enough for paper wallets - also I want to actually be able to easily spend my bitcoins for online purchases. What do people suggest? I downloaded breadwallet to my iPhone - is that a reasonable secure destination? Will me transferring the bitcoins be risky at this point - is it better to leave them until they roll out fixes? Please help

The post isn't about homeless people. It's about people who can't have or choose not to have a bank account.

How would any government be able to trust people (as in their staff) with private keys?  Serious question - how to set something up so that noone will be able to anonymously get away with the huge amounts of money we're talking about here?

Just wondering - if the problem is getting money out of Greece, how is bitcoin going to help, given that you need to transfer the money out to an exchange in order to obtain the bitcoins?  (buying from a Greek exchange is zero sum)

Open Transactions  (and it's related projects) has already solved digital cash in the case of a central issuer. With far less bloat than a blockchain.
Using blockchain for central bank issued currency makes little sense.

If I sell someone a hammer and they use it to club someone, I am not the one perpetrating a crime. All these "money laundering" laws are ethically dubious at best, and are just made up to make law enforcement's job easier. I agree that OP might be running a risk here, but he's definitely not doing anything wrong ethically.

Will slowdown actually increase (at least intra day) price stability somewhat?

The judge has to uphold the current laws. I'm saying the problem is with those laws. So tell that to congressman / senator or whoever makes/repeals the laws in your country.
