Thanks very much for replying and all the useful information! I'll look into Armoury a little more. I'm currently using my old computer to mine with, so although it's running ubuntu it's constantly online which defeats the purpose of an offline wallet, right? I'm assuming it would be safer to just use my regular pc and boot into ubuntu from a hard drive that is usually disconnected?

Wow.. for a recluse he seems pretty cavalier in leaving his real name hanging about the internet giving reviews..
Just gonna go out on a limb here and say a real technogenius recluse would use an "alias" for the internets.

That is obviously fake? It's not professionally written and even has spelling mistakes in it.

Oh wow. Is that too perfect? Maybe even suspiciously so? I'm literally thinking about getting a t-shirt with: "I want my free lunch" - Satoshi Nakamoto, printed on it..

How embarrassing..

But then he wouldn't be able to see!

Not if you're claiming to be middle class. If you want a "house" with full ownership in a middle class area, you're going to need to get as close as you can to £1m really.

Yeh, go Kraken. Withdrawal fees using SEPA are 0.09 Euro. Total. It's amazing
