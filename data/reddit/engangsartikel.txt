Why not just memorize it?
Try the method I outlined above, you'll be surprised how easy it is.
Now, this definitely doesn't preclude also making a backup somewhere, but going without one is a risk that I'm willing to accept.

It's all about the relative probabilities of different risks.
If I have a copy of the mnemonic lying around, I have to worry about it getting stolen or otherwise compromised. Do I trust the staff at the bank where I store the physical copy? If I store it at home, what if I'm robbed?
If I suddenly die or am suddenly permanently incapacitated, yes, the coins will be gone. However, the relative value of all other coins will go up by a very small amount due to greater scarcity. Consider it a small donation to all other bitcoin users.
And, I think that the chances of sudden death or incapacitation are very low. I am in my 30s. Once I hit 50 or 60, I might consider it prudent to keep a copy of the key with a lawyer or in a safety deposit box, since sudden death for something like a stroke or a heart attack becomes a concern.
Edit: Also, even if you don't think it's a good idea, please try to be polite about it.

This isn't a concern here, since the mnemonic is used as the seed for an HD wallet. The mnemonic can be used to recover all state of the wallet, including change addresses.

Actually, think that a chromebook is prudent choice here. Although much of it is a black box and one has to trust google to some extent, I'm not worried that google is out to rob my of my coins.
I did not read every line of code, but I did verify that what the site was serving was what was in github, and that this was well tested, well reviewed, and security conscious software.


This is not a realistic concern.

I think that most of what you said is totally reasonable.
However, the password does not provide significant protection. Although the encryption cannot be broken without the password, the password can be guessed. If it is 10 characters and totally random, then it only provides 70 bits of entropy. That's not a lot. And it's likely much less, since it's probably not perfectly random.

I actually think that it would be nice if someone put a guide up online about how to memorize bip39 mnemonics this way.
The brain wallet passphrase I used was very long, very hard to memorize, and still probably didn't have 128 bits of entropy.
I think that with picture/story mnemonics and spaced repetition techniques, anyone can memorize a 12 word mnemonic. Even if they also plan on storing a physical copy somehow, it can't hurt to also memorize it. The one problem is that it does lend itself to rubber hose cryptographic attacks.

My calendar is online, so I won't misplace it. I did not write the mnemonic in the calendar, only a note to remember to recall the mnemonic.

Nah:
