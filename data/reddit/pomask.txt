I actually dumped everything this morning (basically at the bottom) . Caught about $500 in profit.
Will probably get rekt but I'm just feeling pessimistic about the short term.  Could be 15k tomorrow could be 9k . Nobody knows

That would be amazing. I'm not holding my breath. I finally began just throwing a set amount in per month. I have enough in savvings that if we did take the big shit I could pull the trigger and grab a whole at $6200.  
I wish I had kept clear goals in mind earlier this year, such as "own a full bitcoin" 
Instead of getting obsessed with price. Could have just bought one and stopped thinking about it for the rest of the year.  
Live and learn

Haha yeah I have a $500 flash crash bid for 1/10th of a bitcoin at $5000. Can't wait haha
I think those days may be gone for good though.

you really need to get clear on what you want out of bitcoin or you will get rekt over and over and over again.  
This shit is so emotional, I'm about 2 years in (Summer 2017) and there's been a lot of self - learning. 
  
I consolidated everything I had into BNB in early March of 2018 after the bubble burst in January (amazing call)
We had that mini bull run in April and BNB stayed relatively low gaining, I felt like I was missing out and sold most of my BNB into ICX. Rode it all the way down from $4.11 to $0.80. Sold the remains into an ICO I was gambling on. Obviously that one hurt (250 BNB at $9 .... I'd be doing pretty fucking good if I had left it alone or even sold it back into BNB at any fucking time before it went to pennies. (worst call of all)  
I stayed away from all the major players for the rest of the year (good call as everything continuously depreciated)
I gambled 2 grand into my ICO before their "launch" in October (gambling)
I was up 30% or so and didn't sell any off (dumb)
ICO dumped to 1/5th the price during the December Bloodbath (brutal)
I paid off all of my debt by the end of 2018 and began recouping funds in January. (Brilliant)
 I refused to invest anything back into crypto until I felt like I had a solid foundation. (dumb)
Fast forward to May and I finally started throwing 20% of my income in on a weekly basis, mostly into BTC, but refilled some small alt positions.  (about what you'd expect after all of this)  
Overall, I'm up about 20% or so right now.  At this point, I'm basically at peace with accepting that I have no idea what I'm doing and just trying to accumulate BTC because it's the only one that really has any scarcity while also putting a small amount (maybe 5%) into some alts (Neo, Xmr, Xrp, Eth, Ltc) . 
I figure BTC is what you want to hold long term, and if alts go ape shit again I'll have something that I can actually cash out and enjoy if/when that day comes. If it doesn't I've lost a very small amount of money while still accumulating BTC  
You gotta get clear on what you want. If you don't have a plan you won't have a way to dictate how you act and the market will throw you every which way. 
Good luck!

I salute you sir!  I can't believe I didn't scoop a whole while I could afford one. 
I did throw about $1000 into it but alas!

Fuck man, buying a month ago you'd be up 100%.
