Thanks man, very insightful

Yeah I did bank account, I wasn't aware there were different transaction times between the two. Thanks for clearing this up for me though

I agree, but my concern would be that a near sighted administration like trump's wouldn't view bitcoin from a global perspective, and see it as an immediate threat to the USD. I mean if they want to put a stranglehold on the renewable energy industry  just to save the coal and oil industries, I can't imagine what their views would be on something that threatens the USD as a whole. I guess it's just a thought. Hopefully bitcoin is too advanced for the old man to even conceptualize though.

Thank you for the insight. Just a follow up question - do you have any knowledge on the accessibility of technology, and bitcoin as a whole, in a country like Venezuela ? I find it hard to imagine their citizens have anywhere near the knowledge of bitcoin as we do in more developed nations, and still most people are skeptics.

Yeah I went the bank account route as well. I was aware of the different transaction fees, just didn't know it would be different transaction time. It only makes sense though I guess

Government and Wall Street are basically intertwined. So what's stopping the US government from saying they won't exchange bitcoin for the USD  anymore ? If these entities are truly scared of bitcoin making them obsolete, why wouldn't they take every step possible to ensure they keep the power they currently hold?  I'm not trying to argue, just as a newcomer I'm genuinely curious what could happen if developed governments were to stop accepting bitcoin as a means of exchanging currency.
