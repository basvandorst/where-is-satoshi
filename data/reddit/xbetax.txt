Yes, I have my own private key now.  But it was from BEFORE-FORK BTC.
Any hardware wallet you recommend for my use case?

I moved out my BTC from Coinbase BEFORE the fork, but can I now move it to another wallet with a different address and kept as BTC while in a position of "holding" both BTC and BCC/BCH?

I really hated Coinbase because they could've done it long time ago.  I don't know what's the delay there.

I gave 0.000001, it didn't let me

well, that's when everyone thinks China is going to keep pulling this until $10,000 per 1 BTC , LOL

I did, but nothing shows up, I also tried Coinbase.com and it gives back a new address with the private key.

I did provide some very low fee, but it won't take it. Does the blockchain have any minimum fee set to accept to process the transaction?

too many address and want to move fund into a single address ?
@_date: 2013-11-20 08:16:48
how do I do that on Electrum ?
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:18:39
I did try, but don't work. :-/

since my wallet is now stored in Electrum, can I not use Electrum but other client to send it? As long as I can just reuse the address? I have the private key too.

I bought some at $1120, stupid me now :-(

I had tried setting it to 0.0000000 and still won't let me.

Fine, my bad, but yeah, it's dropping
