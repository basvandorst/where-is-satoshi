it's ok, and thanks.
what kind of proof?
@_date: 2014-04-16 00:33:04
it's titanbtc.com, and the coins seem a little pricey to me (at the current exchange rate)
@_date: 2014-05-05 01:12:20
haha thanks, fellow shibe!
@_date: 2014-05-07 01:30:17
Good to know. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-04-15 22:29:21
lol looks exactly like mine except for the titan bitcoin. Where did you purchase that buy the way, and are they still for sale?
@_date: 2014-04-15 22:32:09
oh, well, I guess i'll google it.
Like the Doge wallet though :)
@_date: 2014-04-14 23:11:01
I agree. what is it?
@_date: 2014-04-22 00:28:39
right on!
@_date: 2014-05-05 00:54:13
don't you mean Dogecoin Co-Founder? lol
@_date: 2014-05-04 16:22:52
so 1000 bits?
@_date: 2014-05-03 21:31:03
I'm a South-Eastern Pennsylvania Bitcoiner (Philadelphia), but still good to know if I ever go up to Harrisburg.
Thanks :)

I signed up like about a month ago, didn't cashout yet so I can say that they are legit in the sense of paying their users, but they seem ok :)
@_date: 2014-04-20 04:40:05
nah, too expensive
@_date: 2014-05-05 01:24:53
the one on tonight, "The Deep Web"
@_date: 2014-05-07 22:36:29
@_date: 2014-04-13 19:29:14
@_date: 2014-05-05 00:52:40
i say dohj
@_date: 2014-07-15 14:30:43
but it was legit though, I got some mBTCs, but I guess now it is a scam :(
@_date: 2014-06-01 19:35:47
oh yeah, i remember that! XD
@_date: 2014-04-20 04:40:46
They do have an interesting selection, but again, a little out of my budget
@_date: 2014-04-13 19:32:55
paper wallets? oh, wait, there cold storage.
@_date: 2014-04-14 05:38:02
I am not an upvoting bot, for your information, and just because I want to share something that I like doesn't mean I have to take this crap from people like you
@_date: 2014-04-13 19:39:27
oh, well how about a trezor wallet? Thats only for BTC, but I hear it's good.
@_date: 2014-02-18 02:09:29
It doesn't have to be credit cards, just a way to buy BTC fast.
@_date: 2014-05-31 16:48:32
Well if that's the case can't all coins live in harmony as the worlds languages do? I mean sure not all languages are equally as large and all cryptos are not equally as large, but even with that, there isn't one superior world language spoken by every person in the world, is there? I acknowledge that bitcoin is the biggest coin, as is Mandarin Chinese and English are the biggest languages, but there are still room in the world for other languages, so it should be the same with crypto. Whether people use them or not, there still should be a variety, or choice. There are at least 1 person that speaks one of every language on earth that isn't dead, and likewise for every cryptocoin on earth that isn't dead. My 0.02 bitcoins
@_date: 2014-04-13 17:13:41
you accept DOGE too, i presume? (promo code: tothemoon as in to^the^moon?)
@_date: 2014-04-14 05:39:31
yeah, the 1% withdrawal fee is a bit sad, I just like the debit card concept, probably the only thing I'll use the account for.

What did the rude prism say to the light beam that smacked into him? Hey! Get bent!
@_date: 2014-04-21 21:58:36
tbh I prefer QR codes but I am fascinated by the new technology
@_date: 2014-09-02 12:36:16
I know, lost 0.004 BTC. Not a big loss, but still sad
@_date: 2014-04-12 14:47:53
haha, Shibe.
@_date: 2014-04-26 18:22:07
just what I expected from this subreddit
@_date: 2014-04-14 23:07:39
I like it, Bravo!
@_date: 2014-04-21 22:34:43
yeah, but still neat though
@_date: 2014-07-25 23:45:00
He didn't.
@_date: 2014-04-14 05:39:53
@_date: 2014-04-28 21:52:52
I'll start a node if that helps :)
@_date: 2014-05-05 01:39:53
your watching too? nice :)
