Yep, this would be the same conclusion I came up with.  They basically looking all coins as if they are in a vacuum.  Pretty weak analysis.  Since all coins pretty much move in sync with BTC, you should pretty much just do the analysis on the BTC halving, why involve all other coins.

The reason when I started up a trezor, and ended up using legacy was because I saw the address started with a "3" and that usually indicates a multi sig wallet and I thought I wanted to control my own wallet.

@_date: 2014-01-17 17:55:57
No it won't go that high.  miners usually do assume the price stays constant while doing calculations, but they do consider halving as a big issue.  If halving occurs before return on their investment, they typically will not be purchasing equipment.  
Also through experience, if miners don't make back their money within the year(this is the longest most people would wait), they typically don't invest, reason is because better technology tends to obsolete their current set of equipment.
you can look back at the hash history for the first halving when price is at 5 dollars and GPU mining and FPGA mining was in effect.

1. technically speaking there should be discounts for users using bitcoin over traditional master card or visa since there are no transaction fees attached to it.  it's like buying things with cash.  But most retailers eat the fees from master card and visa, or just kind of raise their prices accordingly to account for master card and visa transactions.
2. the advantage of bitcoin over cash is you don't have to carry cash, you definitely would not want to be flashing your money when walking through some neighbourhoods.
@_date: 2014-10-30 18:29:40
transaction fees can be adjusted, it doesn't really matter, because by the time reward goes to 0 the theory is the sheer number of transactions with transactions fees will allow the network to stay alive.

2. A bunch of customers stand to lose even more money as BFL is no longer shipping, and no longer giving out refunds.   Take it from me first hand, they did ship and they did give out refunds, no matter how late it was. I have received both from them voluntarily. 
3. Hashpower will now go down, meaning the network is now less secure because of unshipped units and possibly shut down of their mining operation.

Miners who wants to profit from the network would not attack the network using 51%.  This would cause a negative effect on the bitcoinmarkets (ie bitcoin will drop in value) causing a decline in mining profits.
The only 51% attack we have to worry about is a malicious attack on bitcoin itself where the miner is out there to not take a profit, but to control bitcoin transactions itself.

to be honest, merchant adoption will drive the price down.  People holding on their coins are likely to spend at the merchant, then merchant converts to cash.  This is going to be a trend until the the velocity of bitcoin reaches equilibrium with the price.

@_date: 2014-11-19 15:29:33
Not at all.  This is pretty normal.
1. back then the bitcoin economy was based off of purchasing mining equipment using bitpay, so that's why there is such a big discrepancy because now the hashrate is topped out.  This implies that miner purchases have already saturated, and thus any economical activity is actually caused by purchasing real goods and services
2. competition from coinbase.  I believe coinbase also have a convert from coin to cash model for merchants, and it is doing pretty well.
3.  When price was higher back in may, ppl tend to spend more to get more value for their coins, it simply meant that the coins were indeed over priced.  Now we are seeing what the economic activities are actually like during a equalibrium period.  
These are the reasons why I believe that this data point is much more relevant than the one back in may or march or whatever.

@_date: 2014-08-26 19:05:25
pretty hard to attacking it without the physical device present.  Private Keys Never leave the device apparently.  
What's happening is that the device itself signs the transaction, and only relay the signed transaction back to the computer host, it never shows its goods.  
From what I hear, the only attack possible is a malicious firmware loaded into the device that can wipe the device, but can't really steal the keys.  When this happens, the user can just use the written down words to restore wallet.

What about your ROI?  You cannot say mining is ALWAYS profitable when you spent 70k on equipment, and not putting that into account, especially with halving on the horizon.
@_date: 2015-01-21 15:24:06
There might be another explaination.
Miners are short selling MORE to lock in profits.  miners who have already ROIed can short sell more because their position is as of follows.
1. price moves down, therefore difficulty goes sideways(not up) so profit for them is easier to calculate and thus can short sell more to hedge their winnings.
2.  by shortselling they can lock in whatever profits they have right now and replace it with mined coins.
3.  keep in mind, 25k coins is less than 10 days worth of mining.
in conclusion 25k coins is nothing, short selling will be continuous until halving.

I am too young to know that, but I believe that was to fight inflation.  I know there's more money floating around these days, but inflation has been pretty steady.  I believe thats because the velocity of the m1 is incredibly slow because money is only reach the rich. Ie the rich is just hoarding it.  Thus demand for goods and services stay relatively untouched.   So if inflation is low there is no reason for interest rate to be high.
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:52:51

@_date: 2019-03-05 18:42:50
There is a simple solution to this.  M1 only correlates to inflation.  Increase in money supply doesn't mean higher inflation.  Inflation is more like the cost of living.  So when people get their pay cheque, only a percentage of that goes towards paying for things thus causing demand for things.  For example, you used your money to buy tomatoes, thus driving the price of tomatoes up by a fraction.  However the bulk of the M1 is actually saved, just not by poor peopple.  That also goes towards inequality.  Think about someone like Warren Buffet, how many tomatoes  is he gonna buy? probably the same as you.  Thus the paycheque he gets, is likely going towards assets that doesn't count towards inflation. maybe he buys facebook stocks, which doesn't count towards inflation.  
@_date: 2019-03-28 19:51:27
Only if we can no longer service the debt.  at 2% interest rate that translates to 440 billion a year.  I'm pretty sure U.S. collects some where north of trillions a year in taxes.  Considering a low interest rate environment it'll still be many years before this happens.  But yes, like always we always kick the can down the road, it just might now be in our life time that this happens.
@_date: 2019-03-06 18:55:42
What people don't mention is how expensive a 51% attack is.  The amount of time and money to do a 51% attack is likely in the billions, and take likely many many years.  You are probably more profitable in designing your own hardware company and sell phones to be honest.

M1 only correlates to inflation means that more supply means there will be more money, however that doesn't translate the money being spent.  It's when the money is being spent on things that's when actual inflation happens.  More money going around doesn't mean people are willing to buy things.  It's only when more demand for things inflation happens.

That's not how it works.  dot com bubble each company had products built on a agreed protocols in most cases (TCPIP on top of HTTP).  Bitcoin blockchain is more of an agreed protocol rather than a product. Imagine if google built the internet around TCPIP/HTTP and then Yahoo built it around UDP, and so on with each company building around a different protocol.  That's what an ALT is, a competing protocol.  Now the equivalent of dot com bubble would be people investing money into companies built ON TOP of the protocol.

One of the best things about bitcoin is that it is something you control, not something you own. Control &gt; Ownership.

why would you not transfer it to fiat first. Also who in their right mind  has all their assets in bitcoins. this is also the reason that fiat, cryptos can survive side by side.  Also multiple cryptos surviving side by side
If btc and ltc and dogecoin are thriving, then the cost of mounting an attack on crypto itself is much more expensive.  This is why there is room for these other cryptos.
also as to your last point, if you had 51% of the network speed, you need to upkeep 51% of the network speed, that's much north of 2million of startup and with some ridiculous electric fee for upkeep.  This is less reasonable than a spam attack.

@_date: 2018-07-24 00:17:35
Then you simply have no "credit".  In a world where bitcoin is lent and borrowed exclusively, there needs to be a system of negative interest rate other wise it wouldn't work.  The fiat bank charges interest because Fiat loses value over time thus the interest rate is positive.  If there was a bitcoin bank of sorts, I would assume the interest rate would be negative in this case, because it would be truly custodial.
@_date: 2018-07-23 21:39:27
What if you are lending it at a negative rate(or positive) of return based on what ever purchasing power is.  So let's say you lend out 30btc and 30 btc has a certain amount of purchasing power.  Then when it is returned, it could be more than 30btc OR lower than 30btc but the purchasing value of whatever you lent is at a positive?
@_date: 2018-04-16 16:32:16
That's not technically true. Agreed early adopters saw the value in it early, thus more rewarded. However they cannot change the rules of the game. That's the power of being a immutable ledger. Overtime the distribution of value would become fair because the rules don't change. Vs. The current monetary system, the rules change constantly to favour the rich.

Who is policing it?
That's actually a tough question, but a valid answer would be everyone.  The users are the one policing it, as it is a democratic system.  If source code changes to the point where more than 21million are made then bitcoin nodes will fork, as some will agree to the new system and some will not agree.  Bitcoin will literally have 2 chains, that's not good for anyone.  So consensus Must be reached.  It's not up to the developers, they can change the code, but users will NOT accept it.
@_date: 2013-06-28 21:19:59
the nanometer measurement represents the transistor node size, not the engine size, that math shouldn't work. A truer calculation would be just transistor count. thus you need to know die size and the chip size.  Normally density is not even a good measure of how fast the chip works (due to instruction enhancements), but in a case of parallel computing it is a good measurement since instructions are much simpler.

difficulty will always rise until moore's law is no longer in effect (quantum leakage in ASICs).  This is because every 18month the speed of the equipment will double. essentially 2.66 times every 4 years, which will beat out the halving every 4 years.  So you can expect a consistent rise in hashing power until we can no longer make chips smaller.  
@_date: 2013-02-07 16:35:43
The simple answer is to hedge against bitcoin variance.
Developing ASIC would require FPGA then convert the FPGA to ASIC.  This is pretty much what BFL did.  Started off with a FPGA design, sold the FPGA product then create ASICs around the FPGA design and sell it again.  If they were to make money, then their ASIC production would be very low. At current network rate of 25TH/s that would imply that they cannot exceed the rate of 25TH/s (at best since there are massive mining operations that's not included in pools). anything additional would imply a 51% attack on the network.  From that hash rate.  When they first started developing the chip, from FPGA stages bitcoin was worth only $5 per BTC.  they can only assume that bitcoin is worth $5/btc meaning from the data they would get 3.5 million a year, even at that there is variance.  that 3.5 million is not even achievable until 2 years later since it takes them 1 year to have product on hand, and another year to reach 3.5million, though we know this value should be much higher now, in hindsight they cannot assume anything.  So they have about 75k chips, and assume each is sold for about 149 (jalapeno is at 149 per chip) that's about 10million.  That's just in preorders, also along the way they were able to secure the network.

When better $/GH and J/GH people tend to flock to it.  KnC has best of both right now (advertised).  So if they actually ship, then decides not to ship.  It would mean people will buy their product and wait till they ship rather than adding on inefficient hardware to the network because it will take a longer time for the hardware to become obsolete in the long run.

50% attack would require you to essentially double the current network hashrate.  The hashrate follows the price.  If price is high, hashrate is high.  If price is low hashrate is low.  Government will see it as a threat when the price is high.  ie when Market cap reaches 50billion.  by that time the hashrate would have be about 50-100peta hash, maybe more.  That would require them to spend billions rather than million, billions.  There are other problems with this as well, like if they were to build their own foundry and not outsource it to taiwan, that would take some ridiculous time.  Building ASICs starting from scratch is not easy, it takes years to perfect.  Not to mention that they must sustain the 50% attack.  Not to mention what's stopping the people going to litecoin or even alternative cryptos, they literally have to start from scratch, it's too cumbersome imo.

Mathematically speaking it's just the number of leading zeros required in the correct hash.  So the algorithm dictates that every 10 minutes a block is solved over a period of time.  To increase the difficulty, it just means the number of leading zeros is changed from 00000xxxxx... ot 0000000xxxx...
This way the probability of finding the correct value becomes harder.

Cryptography, there are 2 keys, a public key and a private key.
Public key is that QR code and the thing that everyone shares.  This key is your address, and allows you and everyone else to see the balance you have on that ledger aka (blockchain).  Also there is a private key which most clients don't show you and usually hidden, you have to look for it pretty hard to find it.  This is the key that no one else should see, this key let's you Spend BTC that you own based on your public key.

Well in hindsight, but mining was a risk that people took.  You have to purchase equipment that may or may not pan out. Miners don't keep all their coins, they need to liquidate in order to recoup for equipment after all.  Same thing as buying apple stock back in the day.

Yes and No, more than half of the bitcoins are already distributed.  2 scenarios here, 
1. they want bitcoins to succeed therefore they will mine at 50% of the network speed to get 25% of the bitcoins. so that's 10million bitcoins spread between china, u.s. and how ever many world powers that might want them.  
2. they are trying to attack the network, At this point. they need billions of dollars in GPU and potentially billions in power to attack the network.  Or manufacture their own asic.  To manufacture asic they need foundries which only Taiwan has expertise in (unless they build their own).  That would cost millions again and millions to sustain.  Of course if they pick the asic route, people will then just move to litecoin and they have to start from scratch.  Seems improbable to me.
So both options are quite costly.

for a beginner I'd recommend not to invest in miners, just buy BTC directly.  The field is really saturated at this point where difficulty is rising at such an exponential rate and there are still a moutain of backlog to clear.   Mining is always less profitable than buying BTC directly.  You only make money from mining because the price of BTC will go up, in which case, you might as well just purchase BTC directly, espcially when the mining variance seems to be higher than price variance right now.
I only suggest buying mining equipment when mining difficulty reaches a predictable pace. This will happen when all backlog of 28nm clears out, at this point you will be able to predict how much BTC you can earn from mining over a longer term of period of time.  
@_date: 2013-06-28 14:14:47

Every new person coming into bitcion wants to be a miner, but in truth mining is NOT that lucrative.  I am a relatively early miner myself, and I kick myself every single day for mining and not just putting in money into bitcoin ecosystem itself. 
Mining is essentially minting new bitcoins.  The minting process is complicated, Bitcoin is essentially a p2p ledger, your wallet have a keys to access to add transactions to that ledger on bitcoins that your wallet has access to.  To process these transactions, miners use computers to compute them.  The transactions themselves are easy to compute, but to control the inflation, the network will only reward a controlled amount of bitcoins.  To do this, the computing process of the transactions are made harder (hence network difficulty). This value is adjusted every 2 weeks.  So when transactions are processed, along with solving some difficult math problems, only then will you be able to write onto the ledger.  Whenever the ledger is updated, the person who solved the problem also gets to write +xbtc to it's own wallet as a reward for solving the difficult task.  
Mining is not worth it simply because the difficulty jump in the future due to much advanced hardware.  If you are in the market for such advanced hardware, it's backlogged, so essentially buying now will result in receiving it in june, so your money is sitting there doing nothing for a good 4 month, then you proceed to start mining and trying to break even.

I say leave some in bitcoins and see where it can potentially take you 5 years down the road.

Yes it is a representation of mainstream acceptance.  not all btc are in transit at all times.  This mean that you have cash in HAND in preparation to spend.  When this happens it simply means people have btc to spend but are not necessarily spending it.  That would imply if more people have money in hand and there would be less of it readily available in the world for other people which will drive the demand up.  Price will go up when demand goes up.

This is a great article making sense of all this, however without utility it's taking away the most marketable part of the whole thing.  The adoption rate needs to be higher to justify this kind of rise, other wise it is still just another asset class.

If you are pooled mining you don't need bitcoinQT, the ledger would be stored by the pool operator, they simply send you work.  I don't see a reason why your setup shouldn't work.  
You need to download the miner software that supports the jalepano and just run the miner software.

It is what it's need it to dampen the btc rise.  A coalition of governments. Not just 1.  With that in mind, it's still uncontrollable.  We seen what silk road has done for it, and if it's banned we can see a multitude of services based around btc on the tor.

$30 is maybe, $12 is unlikely. $12 was like before wordpress.
If it overshoots the correction we can potentially see 20-25. but not 12.
@_date: 2013-04-02 17:32:13
Litecoin confirms within 2.5 minutes while bitcoin confirms within 9-10minutes as a merchant this can become very useful.  However the network is more susceptible to 50% attacks as the hash rate is still very low compared to bitcoin's.

1. the general consensus is that it's NOT worth it. The simple reason is, difficulty is projected to go up many times of current value, that's why the link you gave is not a good estimate of projected earnings.  Plus ordering now means receiving your product in june due to backlog.  by then, the difficulty would most likely NOT worth the investment.  What is a good investment is just using the money and investing it in bitcoin itself.
2. At current rates, your electricity is negligible, if you were to buy 4x mini rig you have to worry more about how your going to set up your circuit.  each mini rig power profile is at 1500watts, meaning you need 4 dedicated circuits at home to run this, plus another for a host.
3. maintenance is minimal, set up host, plug into host, send in some commands. that's pretty much it.
4. 4 of these can be setup to different wallets, though I imagine you will be mining in a pool.
5. sound is unsure, but pretty loud the fans will be on 24/7. not as bad as gpu i would imagine.
6. profits would be about your electricity rate, say typically .2$/kwh which would translate to 28.8 dollars a day.

This is interesting, didn't know about the extra 3 minute to cause a fork. What's the reason for this, network propagation?
If this is actually the case, then you might actually need closer to 50% to attack in order to pull it off, and I guess at 50% it no longer matters.

Yes To all.
Yes Transfer fees are not mandatory, though your transactions will likely be processed faster as miners when processing transactions prefer a transaction fees attached.  So they will process the transactions with the transaction fee first.

Another problem is for some of the bigger miners who choose to mine at their house, most house capacity is at 100amps which will deliver a maximum of 12kilowatts. After AC, Fridge, washer and dryer, stove, vacuum, you are left with more or less 3kilowatts to power rigs.  3 kilowatts is enough for 5 avalon units.  Some of the bigger miners would like to have maximum efficiency so that they can get the best out of their 3kilowatts.
@_date: 2013-04-18 21:15:06
