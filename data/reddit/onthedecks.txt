[OKCoin]( does. And [the new fee]( schedule is way better than Coinbase Pro.

Hi there. What's your Twitter handle? We got a little backed up with strong participation over the weekend, but catching up now and I can check for you.

One of the OG exchanges actually, since 2013. Last year we opened a new headquarters in San Francisco with a heavy focus on fiat-to-crypto trading.

I work at OKCoin and we also just updated our fees: none over 0.2%. And we're [doing a one-week promo]( with $30 in BTC for new customers if you want to open an account to check us out. Realize this is promoting my company, but hopefully has enough value for the people in this thread that it doesn't get removed. I just want to get the word out!

We're a regulated exchange based out of San Francisco, specializing in fiat-to-crypto trading.

Full disclosure: I work for OKCoin. BUT we also just [updated our fee schedule]( and it's...well...way better. (I know this may be seen as self-promotion and get taken down, but I do feel like it's a valuable contribution in this case). Cheers.

Great question, but definitely above my pay grade! I'd say to go with what works for you until you decide something else works better.

Not everybody is looking for a new exchange so you do you. But I know that there has been a definite interest for a lot of people over the last week, so this is an option for those folks.

Correct, we're global! (with a few exceptions)
