What you are saying is the equivalent to blaming cash if it was stolen out of an open safe.  When banks stole money from everybody else, did you blame cash for "failing as a currency"?

I've tried starting up bitcoind but I can't type anything in it.  How would I go about passing the command to it?
@_date: 2016-08-09 17:39:37


But I mean why stop there?  You should encrypt your password with a still stronger password.  Then make a hint to that password and encrypt that too.  Then make 5 other fake encrypted passwords, each with their own encrypted hints and shuffle them around until you don't even know what you're doing anymore.

Yeah, come on.  Use proper English.  How **many** drugs did you buy before coinbase killed your account?
Just razzing.  I always find it annoying when people associate every person who owns bitcoin with a black market drug dealer.  All because that's the picture that mainstream media continues to incorrectly paint.

If time is not a factor, you could try sending it with minimum, or depending on the client you have, with no fee.  It could take a day or two, or sometimes less if you get lucky.  Say I owed my friend $1, I could send him $1 worth without a fee, and it might take a day, or maybe two to confirm (less if you're lucky) and it wouldn't be a big deal because he doesn't need it right away.  This is not an option when buying something online however, because they usually require confirmations within 15 minutes of making the order.  
@_date: 2016-04-18 17:49:18
There isn't a cheaper way to transfer money, apart from just handing your friend a dollar.

Yeah.  I heard the same thing.  It must be a feature they are planning on implementing.  I didn't see any options when I installed it either.

I've been using [bonusbitcoin.co](  You can get more bitcoin for your time.
@_date: 2016-01-18 13:43:57
I agree.  I think my favorite proposal so far was the increase immediately to 2mb, and then increase by another 10 bytes for every subsequent block that is mined after that.  A small jump initially to allow a lot more transactions, and then the continuous small increase to deal with future adoption as it increases.  Can't remember which BIP it is...
@_date: 2016-01-04 13:49:54
There are a few bitcoin faucets you can try.  Basically you just click a button every few minutes and you earn free bitcoin.  The one I currently use is [bonusbitcoin.co](  It's not a lot, but I earn some just by keeping the page open while I do other things and clicking the button every 15 minutes.

It seems as though English isn't your first language, so to put it simply:
After 3 days your bitcoin will be returned to you if it has not been confirmed on the blockchain.

Bitcoin faucets, in most cases are a webpage, usually with multiple advertisements, which give small amounts of bitcoins to attract people to the website.  The person who signs up and uses the Bitcoin faucet gets small amounts of bitcoin, usually by solving a captcha/clicking a button every 15 minutes or so, while the person hosting the website gets money in the form of ad revenue from the advertisements displayed on the site.  It's a symbiotic relationship.
@_date: 2016-06-01 17:58:36
It has to do with the number of addresses you have which are holding bitcoins and how many addresses will be used in a transaction.  If you get a lot of very small amounts of bitcoin sent to different addresses, which you then use all together to send to another person, the transaction will be bigger.  
For example:
I receive 
.00001btc to address  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
.00001btc to address  BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
.00001btc to address  CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
.00001btc to address  DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
.00001btc to address  EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
If I want to spend the total of all of those wallets, and send it to address XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
My send transaction will look like
.00001btc to address  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX FROM AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
.00001btc to address  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX FROM BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
.00001btc to address  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX FROM CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
.00001btc to address  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX FROM DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
.00001btc to address  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX FROM EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
If I had received all .00005btc to the same address, the transactions would be much smaller and simpler.
For example:
I receive 
.00005btc to address  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
My send transaction will look like
.00005btc to address  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX FROM AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
TL DR  Size of a transaction has less to do with the amount of bitcoin that is being transferred and more to do with the number of addresses that are involved in the sending and receiving.

People don't buy bitcoin from the blockchain.  The blockchain is just a big ledger of transactions which says who has how much bitcoin.  Bitcoins are mostly bought and sold through exchanges, such as coinbase or kraken.  If 15 million people went and tried to buy bitcoin, each person who bought one would make the price creep up a little bit.  As the price rises, people become more likely to sell the bitcoin they are holding because they can make a profit, and at the same time, people become less willing to buy because it would cost more money for the same amount of bitcoin.  
Yes, there is only a certain amount of bitcoin in the world which will ever be created.  It is unlikely however that people would buy so recklessly because as they get closer to buying the very last bitcoin, the price of it would skyrocket so much so that it would unfeasible, economically, to purchase that last bitcoin.

A bunch of different physical objects containing bitcoin wallets are becoming more popular.  Here is another popular one: 
Reasons to use them would be:
1.  A physically traded bitcoin does not have any fee, transaction verification time.  If the network gets clogged up with spam, or just becomes very busy, trading bitcoins using these skips having to use the network and relieves congestion of transactions since they are not recorded.
2. The transactions can be even more anonymous than a regular bitcoin transaction, because if I give you a bitcoin note, there is no record on the blockchain of it anywhere.  If a lot of people use them, they will get shuffled around a lot and it would be almost impossible to tell who is spending it the next time somebody decides to spend it using the blockchain.

Most media outlets don't fully understand bitcoin and are usually unwilling to do the research to fully explain or understand things related to bitcoin.  
The only thing they know how to do is blame bitcoin when a criminal is caught using it.  Even though blaming bitcoin for crime is just as ridiculous as blaming cash for crime.
@_date: 2016-06-16 23:15:04
The public address is shown on the physical item holding the bitcoin.  That means that at any time, you can go on the blockchain and check how much is being held by that address.  It's no less secure than holding bitcoin in any other fashion.  Most of these things have tamper proof seals to make sure that nobody else has access to the private key, so as long as those are intact, your money should be safe.

I had a similar issue a while back.  I was able to buy $100 a day for a while, then it was dropped to $25 per week seemingly without an explanation.  Then it was raised, and now I can buy more than $1000 per week.  As far as I can tell, nothing significant changed in between these limits changing.

Still frustrating to see a "Blockchain Expert" say things like

"Let me tell you about Blockchain technology." or
"Let me tell you about Blockchains."

It's made on a business card, but it's less of a business card and more of a copy of my bitcoin info that I can hand out to someone if they want to send me money and I don't have my phone handy.  Doesn't really happen so much now, but if bitcoin takes off like I think it will then they might come in handy.  I omitted my personal information so that I wouldn't need to feel cautious about handing them out.  This way if one gets discarded, all the person who picks it up sees is a bitcoin address, with no other information.

Now if they could only get the price down.  I know it's only the first couple of batches, so it's understandable that the price is so high($45 for 3 sticks).  It would only be useful for transferring large amounts.  I will definitely be buying some once the price lowers though.

The halving may have been partially responsible for the price increase.  However I think the more likely reason that the price skyrocketed was because the silk road was shutdown not too long after the halving and tons of bitcoins were confiscated and essentially frozen temporarily by the government.
@_date: 2016-07-01 17:30:41
That's ridiculous.  I...I mean he... would never do that.

I've been using coinbase for a while.  They have had some weird problems where they lowered the buy limit to like $25 per day, and then they raised it to $1000 and then they lowered it to $200.  The limits were inconsistent for a while and that was a bit annoying.  I think the limits have become more stable now.  But it is important to know that exchanges have gone under in the past.  Use coinbase to buy bitcoins, but then you'll want to transfer them to a bitcoin wallet you control.  You have an account with them, and they will usually do what you ask.  However at the end of the day, if coinbase goes under and you have coins in your account, you may or may not be able to get them back.  This goes with all exchanges.  If you do not control the private keys then you don't have full power over the bitcoin in that wallet.
