First of all it's around 50%, second I thought Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash was a global currency for anyone to use. Why are you isolating them out?
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:00:47
EDA covers that.
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:57:48
Or you know people choose to mine what they want... BTC/BCH is permission-less remember. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 13:24:18
Lol shitcoin sure. It's only holds the record for most 24hr volume in the crypto space. Even BTC has never seen 4+ billion volume.   
Btw it's called Bitcoin Cash not bcash.

Let this guy explain it to you.  
If you don't understand what he is saying, sell you bitcoins and do some serious research first
@_date: 2017-08-19 15:10:21
Sure thing buddy.

That's the spirit of HODL!

At $4800 we are just playing musical chairs at this point. The price of BTC was around $600 last year and a correction is due whether it's here or at $10000+.

I wonder at what point bitcoin developers become * personally * liable for purposely congesting the network and causing irreparable harm to bitcoin.

I wonder at what point astroturfing accounts will finally understand core will be irrelevant this coming November as 94% of the hashing power will moving to the btc1 client not owned by core.

If miner choose BTC1, that's their choice. This "attacking the network" you are spewing is propaganda. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 22:48:55
Bitcoin is very reputable to losing (correcting) 80%+ of it's gains after a bull run like we are in right now ( this includes alts). Some example are bitcoin has gone from $1200 to $163 in 2014, as well as $34 to $2 in 2012. Not even a year ago bitcoin was just $600 so be prepared for the possibility of bitcoin being under $1000 again in the future.

I'm holding bitcoin because of it's first movers advantage, robust economy and vastly secure blockchain. These point are pretty much the reason bitcoin is price at what it is now, and why alts are not ahead.

Looks like the tumor is growing :/
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:14:40
What... why would that crash the market?? 
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:08:51
"death to bitcoin as we know it" 
An immediate upgrade to 2mb blocks to relieve fees and increase transaction capacity sure is bad for bitcoin. Cute

You're talking to an astroturfing account. Ignore him, he will be irrelevant in November. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 19:11:21
Thank you for having some common sense. This "NO2x" astroturfing rally is really getting annoying. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:13:42
That was a great story, glad it worked out!

Excellent news coinbase. They are doing the right thing by protecting their customers. 
I sent them this letter through their support for maybe they heard??
Hello, 
You recently claimed you will be listing the  upcoming fork as Bitcoin2x (B2X) while giving the BTC ticker to Core's blockchain. As a customer I feel this action is damaging to Bitcoin as you are supporting a chain that has the least amount of hash power, and thus giving the BTC ticker to the wrong blockchain with inferior security that is by definition NOT bitcoin. You are misleading customers who may not be aware of this hardfork exposing them to a potential 51% attack resulting in loss of customers funds that is out of your control, which will damage your brand. The 2x hardfork is intended to be a complete upgrade to bitcoin resulting the other chain to be dead. I believe your action will cause great disruption to this hardfork/upgrading only to confuse your customers and put them at this risk. Please reconsider your actions to list the BTC ticker to the Segwit2x coin as soon as we harfork. I understand you may  have received a lot of emails claiming B2X is an attack on Bitcoin or does not have full consensus, however consensus can only be determined through hashpower as such bitcoin was defined and designed for. If you are concerned about the uncertainty about the success of this hardfork, please understand your actions does greatly impact the cohesion for this hardfork success as you will be united and on board with other great companies, miners, and users who strive to protect and improve bitcoin. Thanks
