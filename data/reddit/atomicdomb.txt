They can't alter the transactions without all their miners concent which is distributed across the world. Did you even read what I said? If antpool wants to do an attack they need all their hashing power of which a majority is not in China even though the pools servers are in China making it seem as if the hash rate is in China when it's not it's being aggregated in China and can be aggregated anywhere. People Wil use bitcoin to get out from the thumb of oppressive governments, I have an oppressive government here in Africa it benefits us far more than first worlders.

Another thing to note is classic price analysis doesn't really work because this is not a stock or a currency. It is a store of value and a currency (the first of its kind). Meaning previous price analysis techniques based off other systems doesn't apply linearly to Bitcoin.

Thanks for asking so many questions I love talking about my work :) so the hardware wallet would be used to sign the opening, closing and any payment you would make through the Network. Your smart phone which is a node can then use your payment sign while routing your transaction through LN. The smart phone would execute the anti fraud logic for transactions which are being routed through an open channel which you are running on the phone itself. The hardware wallet itself is pin and encoding sequence protected, this means when you start it up for the first time you're given a pin to memorize and a sequence to scan. Both are needed to sign a transaction so you've now linked your phone to the hardware wallet and other people wouldn't be able sign anything with just the hardware wallet. If you lose your phone you can reset the hardware wallet and it will spit out a new pin and encoding sequence requiring you to resync your device. The HW also had sdcard backup for your private key (the sdcard should be then store somewhere safe).

Yeah I'm heavily invested into Mining Bitcoin and other Alt coins and deal with the costs a lot. Best way to calculate electricity cost is to work out the average usage of 1 bitcoin miner, then work out how many coins it will earn you, then you have a function based on difficulty, hash rate and electricity cost that tells you how much a coin costs to create. The mining machines and costs have to be paid long before you can earn money back from selling the coin.

With 3000$ production costs which are currently rising I doubt we will ever see $5k again. When bitcoin was $5k the electricity needed to produce a coin would cost you roughly $1250. Right now the electricity cost to produce a coin is around $3400 and rising.

What blows my mind about this is that stock analysis doesn't apply to crypto currencies. Lets talk supply and demand, a company can create a near infinite amount of stocks to sell and can always meet demand by either selling off equity or diluting in some way. There is a finite amount of BTC not controlled by anyone meaning if there is huge demand the only response is for the price to rise because the network needs to somehow pull that demand from hundreds of thousands of separate individuals. Stocks != Bitcoin. This is why economists are wrong so often. Did we forget when all the bankers predicted Bitcoin would drop back down to 1000$ after it hit the high of 6000$, it dropped to 3k before promptly going on its most recent bull run. Yet people still listen to JP Morgan and Jaime Dimon despite their horrible track record for accuracy.
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:53:41
Block reward will run out. Miners are paid in transaction fees and block reward. When reward runs out they will still earn fees. In blocks today some fees are as high as 13 BTC which is already higher than the block reward.
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:04:04
Sure without new miner designs things could get stale. However large players with higher and higher capital investments would be able to catch up to and pass the largest mining firms. Besides we don't really need to worry to much about hash rate so long as the full nodes (validating nodes) are decentralised. I'm a computer scientist myself, with regard to Moore's law, check out the 1 nanometer transistor they recently made which was thought impossible due to quantum tunneling. Another interesting thing to check out is q-bits and the potential of running quantum Asics at -220 degrees, which would be their own kinda gpu to asic style revolution except from asic to quantum comps. Evidence suggest when a quantum computer is built it wouldn't even have that much of a hashrate impact on the Network due to the networks massive size.
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:58:53
Bitcoin has production costs based on network size. This means you first have to pay to mine a coin and only later can sell it. This means that there is a base cost to creating Bitcoin, this base cost goes up as more people join the network through mining. The base cost does not go up when more people join the network through using. The production cost has gone up 800% this year and the price has followed this trend.

Other alt coins don't act as an infinite source of BTC simply due to the infrastructural investment required to make a network work. All alt coins suffer because Bitcoin has a Network effect advantage (much like how TCP/IP became the protocol for the internet due to the network effect despite the existence of better protocols)
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:53:23
You really should look into network infrastructural investment instead of just past price data. The Computer Science side of Bitcoin goes much further into justifiying its price point than anything else. I reckon we will sit at between 50000-70000$ by this time next year. We modelled price based on a number of factors and accurately predicted a december price of between 10000-15000$, we were surprised when it climbed up to 19k and expected a correction.

@_date: 2017-12-28 07:23:02
I'm talking about users and retailers not the miners. Bitcoin has the most people using it meaning anyone who wants to accept payments in a crypto is incentivised to accept bitcoin due to the amount of ppl on the network. It will be good when China bans it as it will end all the FUD. I'm worried you don't understand pools though, because even though antpool is in China it has members across the world. I have once mined on antpool in South Africa. If they get banned then I will switch pools. Many miners will just switch so even though the pools have so much hash rate the point is a bit moot.

Unusable for coffee. Very favourable for $10 million transfers where that same fee stays flat as opposed to a % scale.

Here's a quick example of LN lowering fees. You open a channel with Starbucks. So do a lot of ppl Starbucks is popular. You can now route transactions through Starbucks to anyone of their customers without having to settle this on chain. If Starbucks has 100 thousand people using channels you as a user have access to 100 thousand people at a low fee rate due to network routing. Then when a channel is closed its balance is settled on chain with on chain transactions that aggregate everything that's moves through the channel. The on chain transaction fees will always go up but that hardly matters when u can send bitcoin to anyone under the sun for 10c, remember anyone of those Starbucks users opens up another channel to a hub and you get access to those users at low fees...

Upvoted the ripple crash will create bitcoin FUD.
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:54:00
It will move the transactions onto a second network layer that uses proof of stake. This network layer will use channels to finalised channel balance when a channel is closed on the main chain. This means for the cost of 2 on chain transactions you could have hundreds of thousands of lightning layer transactions that consolidate into the channel. It's an exponential solution to the scaling problem which in turn tries to keep up with he exponential growth of the coin. Bigger blocks is a linear temporary stop gap to scaling.

@_date: 2017-12-29 07:01:02
I'm just going to comment on the centralisation  concern. My background is in a dev working on a LN wallet implementation. Our wallet let's you make your smart phone a LN node, where you can choose the fee structure. If for instance Starbucks sets up a channel with each of its customers, every customer would now be able to do LN transfers to each other at relatively low fees by routing through Starbucks. Yes Starbucks technically can increase fees on their nodes but they are incentivised not to because they opened all those channels to sell coffee not make transaction fees. In all likelihood we could see many retailers take this multi channel approach with very little fees as it allows them to sell things to people with the least hassle. LN nodes will be significantly more common than validating nodes as most wallets will be able to double up as a LN node and wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-28 09:48:56
Not really. Due to the technical nature of mining and the release of smaller nanometer silicon chips. Every 18 months or so the best mining machine becomes out dated. This forces companies to invest heavily in constantly making new mining machines because if they don't someone else could and they would quickly lose their advantage because the relationship between nanometer size and performance is exponential not linear. E.g. antminer s9 is orders of magnitude better than antminer s3 or s5

The recent news flair up was a scam after b2x was canceled by the backers a while ago.
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:02:21
Second layer solutions mean miners still earn lots for mining blocks but rather the block contains aggregated transactions. Let me give u a super simplistic example, you open a channel with Starbucks you buy 3 coffee a day for 1 month, you close the channel with them. Now you have done 90 transactions (3 a day for 30 days) between you and Starbucks but on chain there are only 2 transactions your opening Starbucks channel transaction and your settling Starbucks transaction which settles the balance on chain. In this example the miner earns fees for the two on chain transactions, the cost of those fees can then be divided by the 90 transactions you did on the channel. This example just scratches the surface but illustrates a 1 in 90 reduction in user fees without removing miner incentive. Remember you can do lightning payments to anyone else who is also connected to the Starbucks node by routing through Starbucks so the number of transactions per aggregation could be much more...
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:34:50
100% And that has been Cores problem with the bigger blocks scaling solution. Over time it becomes untenable for the average user which threatens decentralisation which is where the true value comes from.
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:22:24
So spot on. We are busy implementing LN into our wallet. It would make your wallet double as a node whenever you are in channel and you would earn transaction fees on your channel while it's open.
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:18:06
Hello I'm currently working on a LN wallet so we are interfacing quite close with LN.
Most people brought up how you can open channels with others and do a bunch of transactions between two parties and then settle the difference on chain. This is a simple and obvious way LN reduces fees.
However what I haven't seen anyone mention is the fact that you can also send bitcoin to anyone else who is also interconnected to you or anyone else I'm in channels with. This means if you open a channel with Starbucks to buy coffee and if a million other people also do, by staying connected to the Starbucks channel you will be able to send bitcoin to anyone else who is also connected to their channel and anyone else who is connected to any of them. This is the REAL scaling advantage as most people would open channels with trusted retailers and would then get access to that retailers entire network of customers to whom they could transact bit coin with very low fees.
Hope that helps feel free to AMA.

Effectively zero isn't zero if you add up 10c one million times you get 100 thousand dollars. E.g. a payment channel could do 1 million lightning network 1c transactions and aggregate them into two on chain transaction each with a mining fee of $5000. Users get cheap transactions and miners are still incentivised.

Lots of people are doing dev on it. Some more openly and some under NDA. I'm working on a LN capable wallet atm. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 12:32:11
Not really... LN is just a sophisticated implementation of multi sig wallets and time locks that results in a trustless proof of stake network where users can transfer funds with large amounts of anonominity protection and low fees. So it doesn't create a backend to put other applications on it, the backend it ultimately relies on is the blockchain when settling channels.
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:35:14
Lightning network allows bidirectional payment channels to aggregate payments and later finalise them on chain. This process nodes transaction volume stress to another layer. The second layer still uses multi sig systems to ensure encorruptability. Google the details of how lightning network payments work.
@_date: 2017-12-26 08:57:37
Please stop analysing the price from a markets perspective. Bitcoin has massive infrastructural investment and production costs which are far more important indicators of price.

You are so dumb. Yes mining pools are in China yes 70% of the hash rate comes from Chinese mining pools. Each mining pool is made up of people from around the world. This means the pools which are hosted in China don't physically have those mining machines. They may have some but not the majority.

Due to centralisation idiot. If gold was decentralised then there wouldn't have been any issues. The problem is gold is heavy and difficult to transport in order to trade with it. Which lead to people creating promissory notes for gold stored in banks. The banks are a centralised form of control designed to solve trade issues with gold. The corruption was introduced at the banking level with banks issuing more promissory notes than the amount of gold they owned. Bitcoin has no centralised issuing body that could manipulate the supply meaning it won't have the same fate as gold. People seem to forget that Bitcoins biggest innovation was solving the double spend problem without a third party and that its biggest achievement is decentralisation without abuse of the system and NOT the fact that the Bitcoin supply is limited. In fact the bitcoin supply could have a permanent inflationary policy and would still be viable as a Crypto Currency and would still be better than fiat (see ETH for an example of this). Learn what blockchain tech is about FIRST then you will understand why people are excited by Bitcoin, because limited supply and "copying gold" is not the reason.

China is not planning on banning the mines. If they tried to nationalise the mines. The miners would run and sell off as much hardware as they could which would result in China not being able to acquire as much hash rate nationally as is currently owned by individuals in China. This combined with the fact that the government wouldn't know how to expand a mining operation would mostly lead to nothing. eg: China has 65% Hash rate, China nationalises mining, miners sell of equipment, Chinese government has 20% of the hash rate, rest of the world keeps making mining machines, Chinese government has negligible hash rate.

"what then stops those people from making it just as hard to influence this future ideal Bitcoin economy as it is to influence monetary policy today? Nothing." You are quite incorrect here. The code stops people from changing the system without consensus, if you try to change the code without consensus you will create an altcoin through hardfork (see Bcash). Anyone can participate in the bitcoin network simply by learning the maths and computer science behind it. This is not and will never be true for traditional banking.

This news was then manipulated into a fake story about China banning bitcoin/ halting the exchanges. The Chinese government is stopping one exchange entirely because they broke laws but not the others. All the news is a mix up of info which amounts to a bunch of FUD.

Incorrect. Since the rest of the world calculates fees based on how much you put in and Bitcoin does it based on the number of inputs and outputs. One could have low fees be a feature of the network whilst having high miner rewards, it's all just about the network is structured. Heres a quick example: You transact with starbucks through lightning network everyday, you make 10 transactions in a day and pay 10 small mining fees. Once the day is over you close the lightning network channel and it settles the final block on the block chain, the final block has the sum of all the smaller fees you paid throughout the day so the miner earns a larger profit per block and you paid less per transaction. There are many ways the code can be optimised to get more out of blocks.

Surely this is a Coinbase issue not a bitcoin issue.

Check the CNY exchanges. They have been selling $700 bellow market price meaning this price jump isn't benefiting the Chinese. Dead cat bounce doesn't apply when its a currency not a stock/share.

Because that opens them up to regulation and Government. Something they are trying to avoid for obvious reasons. The obvious reasons are that once the exchanges are under the thumb of the government it becomes increasingly easy for government to shut them down. Bitcoin in principle is anti-government meaning any long term analysis sees governments trying to ban bitcoin. So its up to the community to ensure that the governments don't acquire control over bitcoin because they currently have none.

Mostly because exchanges or web wallets are holding most peoples BCH. XAPO still have my BCH which I will be insta selling.

Because everyone else seems to Lazy to answer these easy questions for a new bit-coiner I will. Also this is reddit, if people ask questions answer them, maybe Google isn't specific enough.
1) First off, no one knows who Satoshi is, where he lives and he hasn't contributed to the bitcoin code since 2011. Satoshi, or anyone else cannot delete Bitcoin because it is decentralised and distributed between thousands of nodes. This means in order to effectively shut down bitcoin you have to shut down all the miners and full nodes (of which there are thousands all around the world). So basically this can never happen due to how the system is designed.
2) Same thing that happens when Dollar drops to 0 and you lose everything you had in Dollars... Difference being Dollars are always printed and subject to inflation, Bitcoin's monetary policy has been decided by code which is why only 21 million coins will ever be minted which will in turn protect bitcoin as a store of value.
3) I don't know US Tax law. I'm from South Africa where Bitcoin is completely legal and not taxed, so in SA you can earn in Bitcoin and only have to pay tax IF and WHEN you turn the bitcoin into cash.
4) Nothing technically. You trust any company which you give your Identification information to. There are also decentralised exchanges you can use to avoid those risk (they have lower trade volume though). A better solution is that we get to a point where none of those factors matter and everyone can buy and sell bitcoin anonymously.
5) Bitcoin isn't a company. It isn't registered in any geographically location. It isn't owned by anybody. Many users of Bitcoin see the petrodollar as a failed monetary system that drains wealth from the rest of the world, why would anyone who supports bitcoin want to give the stock market and US regulators access to bitcoin?
Hope that answers everything.

Bitcoin is not a share or a stock. That kind of analysis doesn't apply well because Bitcoin is a network with a network effect at play and it's traded as a currency not a stock.

In America it would be gains if when you bought the item on Amazon and the value of Bitcoin was higher than when you bought the bitcoin.

China makes up 11% of the BTC trading so one could expect an 11% drop in price from what the price was prior to the news. That also assumes no new exchanges form (that comply with regulations) and no Bitcoin is mined and illegally sold there.

Sorry, I just thought it might help explain why people are getting longer confirmation times on transactions atm, as BTC just lost 1/4 of its hash-rate to BCH. Of course only temporarily but it's really sad to see miners prioritising short term profit over the long term stability of the network (which does wonders for bitcoin PR and increases long term profitability).
@_date: 2017-09-18 05:54:41
The whole point of bitcoin is to get rid of the concept of banks. It's pointless for the new system to capitulate to the old system when they are provided obviously better services.

Creates a steeper gini coefficient and favors miners. If the coins come sporadically miners can create supply dips (when blocks comfirm slowly for the 2 weeks people mine BTC) followed by supply crazes (when the blocks are faster because ppl temporarily switched) which will cause massive price volatility which isn't good for anyone.

You're half right. Deflation is not something that is "a shitty scenario". Deflation is the otherside of the same coin that inflation is. 
Economics 101: An inflationary economy favors spending and incentives taking out debt (as long term debt represents less value over time in a highly inflationary economy).
A deflationary economy favors saving and incentives the storing of wealth which in turn causes goods to be worth less per unit of monetary measure. 
The real question is which economy is better for society at large? An inflationary economy favors the short term as do 4 year presidential terms. Favoring the short term isn't great for the environment or the world on longer time-frames. We haven't tested a truly deflationary economy yet as money didn't have a digital counterpart and therefore had a finite amount physical bills that could be broken down into a finite set of smaller units until deflation causes the penny (the smallest unit) to be worth way to much. This isn't a problem in a digital domain where people can easily add another 0 to solve the issue of deflation, eg. 0.1, 0.01, 0.001 as computers have no finite limit we can feasibly have a deflationary economy and favor savers over debtors. Until then don't bitch about high Student Loans rates as our inflationary economy was designed for them.

It's important to remember that the reason governments print money to stimulate the economy is because each printed bill isn't easy to subdivide. So when they print it stimulates the economy short term because people need the liquid cash to break their notes which can't be broken down. A single bitcoin can be broken down 100 million times, meaning the supply of money is more than larger enough (21 million x 100 million) so all that "printing" would do is cause a devaluation of money. ALSO the idea that printing money stimulates the economy is debated by economists and generally not agreed on, also any proof for it is always short term. And when you take the idea of government spending to its logical extreme you get an economy with 100% taxation where the government spends all the money, the problem is we have seen governments like that before, they are communist and don't work. This is why Keynesian economics is flawed.

No they shouldn't get involved because a currency doesn't HAVE to be guaranteed by any government. It is impossible to have a global currency with that mindset. Also governments can't shut down bitcoin because the network is decentralized meaning any banning of nodes is undermined by the large miner adoption rate, just go look at how much network hash-rate has increased these past months.

Funny thing is you can already pay with bitcoin on Amazon :D All you have to do is buy an Amazon gift card which you can then load with Bitcoin. So you could have said they are already doing it in one form and introducing full support is just a logical step forward.

The problem with BCash is that they don't understand how the code works in conjunction with everything else to form a system. The problem with big blocks is that you need 555MB block sizes to compete with VISA which means larger blocks ARE NOT the long term solution to scaling. Multiple layers are the long term solution. If both chains implement lightning network the Bitcoin chain becomes more trusted because with smaller block sizes more people can run full nodes which makes the network more decentralized. BTrash is BTrash and will BCrash.

We don't have our own micro currency such as Bit Crystals. Instead players buy booster packs for 1.5$ in BTC and receive 5 cards in the pack. Packs are limited in supply as well meaning when a set is sold out the only way to get cards is from other players.
