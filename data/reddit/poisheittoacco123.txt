Difference is that they're not hoarding 99.9 of their wealth in wallets. We have infrastructure, eletricity, jobs, apartments, technology ect. Hoarding not being profitable forces the money back into the economy.

Money laundering is easy with bitcoin and it offers anonymity. Why else would deepweb markets use bitcoin? 
Corruption is not the only issue here, the rise in value of bitcoin has propably spawned a bunch of crypto millionaires who made their money selling kiddie porn / stolen credit cards / fentanyl ...

But how does bitcoin magically make them wealthy? How does this happen? Do you think that Rajat, shipbreaker that earns 2 dollars a day and spends it all on food, has never even read a single book, is thinking about participating in a decentralized, globalized space?

I don't get why people compare bitcoin to cc, Credit cards goive you CREDIT. Taking out loans is never going to be free. I use debit for all my purchases, never payed a penny to banks and transactions are instantaneous + if I get hacked the bank gives me my money back.

What stops me from copying bitcoin and starting my own shitcoin? Why would mine have a different value if it's the exact same thing?

Could you please just say what it is that makes bitcoin more accessible?  
Edit: scrolled through the video trying to find your point. I can read very fast so just linking a video without even giving me a timestamp is incredibly lazy and a massive waste of my time, especially when you could have written his point in a few sentences ssving me about 20mins of listening to some preacher preach. 
So banking/financial services are simply not available for much of the population. That's your argument right?
Why do you think this is the case? It's because these people are extremely poor and live on a meagre wage living paycheck to paycheck. Why does someone who makes 2 dollars a day need to be transfering money internationally? These people don't even have internet so traditional banking is easyer for them to reach than having to buy a computer, getting dependable internet, aquiring 2 dollars worth of bitcoins going to the shop which also needs to buy a computer and internet, sending bitcoins to the salesman who needs to then convert the bitcoins into fiat. You just bought yourself a kilo of rice for 2 dollars and 10 dollars in transaction fees, yay.

You seem to have basic misunderstanding about stocks: 
Let's say you have a growing company, your dad isn't Donald Trump but you really need a new factory to keep growing. What do you do? You put yourself on the market and sell 50% of your company in stocks in order to get capital from shareholders. Shareholders now have a stake in your company, they vote in board members to run the company and are entitled to dividends if you pay them. As the company becomes more valuable the value of stocks rise, sometimes the shareholders benefit more from money being put into the company instead of receiving dividends. For example Apple pays quarterly dividends to all shareholders, the more you own, the more you get. Sone companies decide to invest that money into RND or infrastructure. 
That's some basics of stocks. Sure, P/E ratios are fucked right now but it's been a bull market due to government intervention, we are overdue for a dip in stock prices. But stocks are backed by actual companies, unlike bitcoin, which is entirely based on belief.
Apple stock can not go to 0 without the actual company losing value, bitcoin can go very close without anything fundamentally changing about bitcoin. 
Let's say I copy the open sourse software of bitcoin, so they are basically the same thing, my shitcoin and bitcoin. If I have exactly the same thing, a finite crypto, with a blockchain and all that jazz, would it be the same price as bitcoin? What makes bitcoin so special? How is it finite if coins with better scaling, faster transaction times and deflation built in appear every day? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:34:47
So you live in an undevelopped part of the world without internet so you should buy bitcoin?

He owns it because he legally owns it by owning the majority of the company, I don't know if you are trolling at this point or what. 
"Cryptographic public ledger capable of trabsferring data" so? There are a thousands others like it, some with greater bandwith, faster transaction times, lower power usage ect, yet they cost a fraction of bitcoin. 
And that's not really a utility. A utility is fairly simple, transportation, currency, medium of exchange, store of value, source of energy... In this case bitcoin could be seen as a store of value. It's not like people who buy bitcoin are going "hmmm, Ive got a car, I got a house too, all I need now is a cryptographic public ledger capable of transferring data, because i really need to transfer some data cryptographically right now and what better way to do it than on a handy dandy public ledger! 
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:26:25
What in your opinion is the utility of bitcoin and if bitcoins utility is being a store of value, why do stocks not have utility. 
So jeff bezos, the founder and majority stock owner of Amazon actually doesen't own Amazon because the value is just faith based? Nit based on him getting millions in dividends, exercising a lot of control over the company and basically having a lot of influence over other shareholders, not to mention the government and way the future unfolds. It's just a house of cards built on nothing but an extremely successful multibillion dollar juggernaut of a company.

Well most financial experts agree that bitcoin is a bubble so it's not that weird that the layman who trusts experts would think so too.

I get that it's handbuilt and super nice, handles like a dream, but supercars in general just turn me off completely. It's like having a huge obnoxious neon sign pointing at yiu and 100000 watt speakers blasting "Hey everybody! Look at me!". If i was mad rich Id do restomod cars, MAYBE id get a pantera (I prolly would).
I get that pro drivers would love em, they're probably heavenly on a track, but the first thing that comes into mind for me, for a supercar driver, is some spoiled Saudi brat who'll drive into a mom pushing a stroller and get off scott free.

So bitcoin provides utility by being data on a usb stick that took thousands of dollars to produce for example.
The company that built your house, your car, makes the eletricity used to mine bitcoins, makes the computers that create bitcoins and made this current life possible, are useless?

No, utopias dont exist and there is always room for improvement no matter how good things get. Our country is safe and stable, which I think a lot of poor places would need. Running a functioning state is no easy feat tho and high taxes require a lot of trust thowards the government, which many poor countries lack. Hard to say what's the best option for corrupt places as corruption just ruins everything no matter the system. 
 I wouldn't say we are naturally rich, we got some ore and wood but that's it. We export technology and refined products.

Let's say you borrowed 3 bitcoins at 20 000 dollars, the bank expects you to pay back in bitcoins, only now they're worth less than 70% of what they were back then. Is that a fair deal for the bank? What if you borrowed at 1000 and the bank is now asking back 7 times the value a year later?
