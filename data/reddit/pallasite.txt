Thats a really bad bar to hold the system bitcoin is based off of to.

It does. They control 40% of the coin. They absolutely still control the BTC market until wall street actually buys that from them; if they decide to sell them. Or the fiat billionaires create something that's makes their legacy coins irrelevant at  that point we are not talking about the bitcoin market anymore.
I think your point is based on complete fallacy

The ledger could become fucked up and people could lose faith. Why do you think its forever infallible?

He thinks the specultive market is over valueing BTC. He can think that very reasonably when a bunch of investors just last year were buying it at double its current price.  His point is right now the technology is still in its infancy and adding value to the coin is what someone who has no understanding of how much speculation is all ready propong the value of this tool which no one uses for its inteded purpose. The only thing giving BTC value is speculation, most of it by young naive people who were given the kool-aid and talk to spend their money to get a ride to the moon.

What? It completely does exist. You can buy one today. But let not pretend any state actor could find a reason to do this. It would let the test and program atomic computers, keep control of finance and possibly game the global economy in their favor.
In the next 10 years what he said is not at all unfeasible.

i hate to say this but Bitcoin is technology and is open source, something that will always have volatility that may never make it a true alternative to the current banking system.

Thats funny. I buy opals from Indonesia direct from miners. They make me use western union. I always giggle at the exchange conversions. 400$ was over 1,000,000IDR yesterday when i sent them some funds.
