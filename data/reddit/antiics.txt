People said this when the initial alt boom was dying out (Bitcoin clones) in 2014/2015. Don't underestimate the ability for the market to innovate.

I agree with some your thoughts in the TC article. Ideas like "startup onramp" provisions in the regulatory framework make a lot of sense and can encourage technological innovation and disruption without scaring the NYC startup scene across the river to New Jersey. 
However, I take issue with a few points you make; it doesn't really serve the Crypto community to spread misinformation about the proposed regulatory framework. In your article you say:


Well, no. Not really. The regulatory framework explains this in pretty clear english. You have to notify the superintendent if there is a "material change" to your fundamental business model. What are some examples of "material changes"?






So t-shirt sales would not raise legal issues about the permissibility of your product. And if all your doing is selling t-shirts then you're entirely exempt from this regulatory framework and do not need a BitLicense [in the first place](


I am a New York City based technologist and I'm not exactly a fan of the regulations as they stand. There is definitely room for improvement, and hopefully the community will be able to influence such policies in a smart way. 
The fact of the matter is New York State is the center of the financial world and Bitcoin is a financial instrument. Superintendent Ben Lawsky's offices are mere moments away from Wall Street. Like it or not the idea of "Big Bitcoin/Big Crypto" is something we as a community are going have to account for. 
We can either make defeatist comments like "no small startup could afford" to build a secure system that meets with the regulations (that's exactly what my startup is trying to build today - with a solid software engineering infrastructure) or we can educate, debate, and try to influence the policies in a meaningful way.

His logic hurts my head:


Breaking it down:
1. Scoundrels have a head start (sure...)
2. So the regulators are never going to be able to catch up (true)
3. Therefore the Feds will shut down bitcoin (false)
4. The regulatory arbitrage is too far advanced (See  &amp; 
5. So the world's financial regulators will have to kill it (See 
Bold statement but there's nothing there. Where's the data about how far ahead the "scoundrels" are? How far behind are the regulators? Etc.
Just seems like he's a detractor for the sake of being a detractor (and also generating page clicks...).

The problem with this thinking is that China produces most of the world's silicon[ [1] ]( If the government wanted to, they could nationalize 51% of the hash rate and there is not much the world could do about it, short of out-producing Chinese silicon manufacturers. 
Yes, there would be forks, but the Chinese would own the strongest chain.
