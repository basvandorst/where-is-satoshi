XPM is interesting; first altcoin to produce a useful bi-product of the proof of work
@_date: 2013-09-06 15:09:09
yes jdtmp4!

measure in terms of the current inequality of our current system, and how liberating it will be for the world with a currency without borders.
@_date: 2013-09-21 14:47:10
if you could recover it without the private key; our entire bitcoin protocol would be useless.
@_date: 2013-08-30 20:50:39
he nailed it
@_date: 2013-09-01 03:07:32
aha yea, this business is NOT worth 10k bitcoin 
@_date: 2013-09-11 01:28:34
would recommend getting some initial entries before going to market.
@_date: 2013-09-19 19:32:38
mt Gox won't let you withdrawal

obvious troll; though good response
@_date: 2013-09-17 19:41:05
@_date: 2013-09-27 10:50:07
read between the lines; bitcoin applies heavily to this situation.
@_date: 2013-09-19 07:03:32
accepting a zero-confirmation transaction still beats reversible paypal/credit card methods.
also; you'll know within 10minutes rather then being charged-back weeks later-&gt;
@_date: 2013-08-31 19:13:11
right; it's by far the most differentiated altcoin + still relatively new 
@_date: 2013-09-13 19:58:14
reserved coinOrder.net for this purpose
@_date: 2013-09-15 00:15:02

give canadianbitcoins a call, they'll verify your info over the phone.
@_date: 2013-09-18 17:19:54
@_date: 2013-09-15 05:21:04
looks good; considering hosting coinSearch.net and a few other coinDomains with you guys.
@_date: 2013-09-05 11:20:55
eBay; suffering from too many chargebacks- is an *ideal* candidate to incorporate bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-09-04 13:09:38
Your much better off buying the coins themselves.
goodluck; $20k today could be $200k next year!
@_date: 2013-09-17 16:45:58

@_date: 2013-09-23 15:02:29
sure; do you accept PayPal-&gt;
@_date: 2013-09-04 01:20:08
yup, holding XPM with high expectations 
@_date: 2013-09-12 02:24:21
@_date: 2013-09-09 21:57:14
+1 good article; XPM differentiates itself among other altcoins.

Hold onto it; hopefully it crashes + burns with your need to brag 
@_date: 2013-09-11 13:54:59
wow; I agree with you on this one.
@_date: 2013-09-21 17:47:50
I'm inside right now!
@_date: 2013-09-22 23:25:08
and if anyone claims it's a waste of energy, remember gold mining costs substantially more + hurts the environment.
@_date: 2013-09-11 12:11:16

@_date: 2013-09-19 03:21:35
give it time, usually takes 1-2 business days for investors to get fiat into bitcoin 
@_date: 2013-09-17 17:13:29
inflation referring to *new* minted coins; rather then the roi on the price
@_date: 2013-09-20 01:03:11
anybody with experience shorting bitcoin likely had both knee-caps broken in by now.
@_date: 2013-09-10 17:41:11
great idea; will add cavirtex to coinCanada.net once it's up + running
@_date: 2013-09-10 22:27:54
awesome, dropped by Havelok investments last week and noticed the casinobitco.in IPO sheet 
@_date: 2013-09-24 11:26:29

@_date: 2013-09-06 13:29:40
Most are just scrypt clones; though XPM atleast uses an entirely new algorithm to generate prime number chains.. for science!

lets go for $100billion
@_date: 2013-09-27 20:56:25
Did blockchain email you whenever a transaction was sent/recieved involving your account? If you retrieve the address, I would try begging blockchain.info to look into the activity to match your IP address to the IP used with your lost identifier.
@_date: 2013-09-13 19:57:06
they think they missed the boat 
@_date: 2013-09-09 11:35:45
give it a break

@_date: 2013-09-15 00:13:37
@_date: 2013-09-02 13:14:48
exactly; this is like the pre-bubble blip.
@_date: 2013-09-15 05:37:54
if your looking for a hobby; go for it.
otherwise, a better investment would be to just buy the coins
@_date: 2013-09-23 23:49:21
@_date: 2013-09-21 03:20:19
oh, well that more than makes up for the delay.
@_date: 2013-09-02 13:42:55
perhaps the accidental 200btc fee to ASICminer; which was graciously paid back.

@_date: 2013-09-13 21:22:49
@_date: 2013-09-11 21:54:34
good point; only relevant to CPU-exclusive coins (xpm-primecoin)
@_date: 2013-09-20 11:33:06
aha the good old copy pasta
@_date: 2013-09-01 15:45:12

xpm; primecoin.
only altcoin differentiating from SHA/scrypt algorithms by instead solving prime number chains; a useful output for math + science.
@_date: 2013-09-06 16:33:07

same way someone looking to invest in gold wouldn't be advised to buy their own mining equipment.
