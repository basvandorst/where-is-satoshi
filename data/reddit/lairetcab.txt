Thanks, will attempt to test buying and selling on the testnet to figure out exaclty what i need to save in non digital form.  Appreciate the help.

I might be one of those people.

What's missing from OP's data to ensure the OP's non digital backup works incase the main backup fails?

If I specify a change address, does that not remove the danger when making a transaction?  For for example, when I want to spend from that address, as long as I remember to specify a change address, is all not well?


Yes, I am testing with testnet at the moment.

In that case, any recommendations for creating a non digital backup?  I should have asked that in the OP.

I want to make multiple copies, and to have multiple hardware wallets will get expensive, plus i will have to save the passphrase on paper anyway in multiple locations, so i thought, why not just use a paperwallet, as i want to create a separate backup stash of bitcoin.

Long term paperwallet, with a public key to send funds ot it.

Thank you very much for the explanation!  Will look into the advanced coin-control features which I never new existed until now.

I already have the bitcoin-core wallet backed up.  I guess I wanted a backup for the backup which is a non digital backup.  For that scenario, will the above be fine?

Does a service similar to this example spreadsheet I created already exist?  If it does, please let me know.
