Thanks very much. I myself am in China, but I tried using BTCChina, but the are not allowing to deposit CNY at the moment. I will try it out later, and tell you all how it went. 
Also this site is good, as it allows you to buy many different types of coins. Even noticed ANC. with looks cool, but I never saw most of the coins that are on that site.
Edit : care to tell me how to sign up to the site ? I'm having a hard time trying to figure it out. Thanks

I don't like been called a lier. Yes the government has given until that date to stop all payments, but that doesn't mean people won't stop before that date, and they, BTCChina, have. 
The line you quoted just proves my point even more, the CNY withdrawals will continue to operate in the interim, but you can no longer deposit CNY. And thats all I was saying, I think you just misunderstood what I wrote. And things are not normal, they are far from normal, so I'm sorry that you couldn't understand what I copied and pasted.
