You made a poor choice by using LBC, if you run to any trouble don't expect support to be there for you lololololol

They're at it again!!

Don't bother, they've been really bad at responding to tickets and when they do they are not helpful or unmotivated to solve your problem, you get the sense that they just don't care, they are also in need of some serious updates to their systems.

Yay for P2P! At least I know who the money goes to, "power to the people" so to speak. I'm mostly on Paxful because there's a variety of payment options

It's good to know where you stand and to understand the other side of the story. Dumbass comment

Sorry bro, I'm not on bisq. Chose Paxful and so far no regrets! Feel free to change my mind
@_date: 2018-05-24 07:20:48
Yes, it is time. Thank goodness I'm not the only one!

Count me in pls! Paxful ftw!

Africa is just a small market, they should really be looking at Australia

I know who's waiting 8 months and one since Feb. Ditch coinbase.
@_date: 2018-06-12 06:07:47
Yup I tried it and it seems like it's the most straightforward.

I wish they'd pursue other countries as well. All the talk is about African countries, we South Americans feel left out!
@_date: 2018-06-19 10:56:43
Awesome. Wow.

I haven't seen a site that (a) has that many payment methods, (b) actually built schools in Africa, and (c) pays for 24/7 support. I've traded a lot within several months and I'm satisfied with the service. Fuck the haters, you do you Paxful. We got your back.

Yeah, glad Bitcoin was used to help the country given their inflation situation
