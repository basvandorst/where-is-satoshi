Nothing bro. It was a new icloud email .
Master reset to the iphone before , i updated it to the latest version of blockchain and iphone software .
All was new never used it anywhere . I have a laptop account that i use for payments . This iphone was just for safe storage .
What i seen now is that my blockchain app on the iphone needs an update .

i really dont understand how can someone access the funds on the phone. Where is the point when someone received my [blockchain.info]( login details .. i would like to know the answer to that question. The scammer means he is a billionaire if was that easy take my money... the 2.4 BTC are a lot of money for me , in my country the minimum wage is 300$
@_date: 2019-09-17 13:14:33
never had problems before with blockchain.info in my mind they where the most secured . i never used anything else then blockchain.info
@_date: 2019-09-17 11:59:41
Seemed perfectly safe in my mind . i only used the phone to intall the blockchain.info app .. i tought how can someone hack and iphone or blochain.info .. it seemed imposile until now
@_date: 2019-09-17 13:23:06
yes .
@_date: 2019-09-17 13:25:18

@_date: 2019-09-17 11:38:41
No bro . The hackers did it . They used my address to receive money and send them out again .
After they stole my 2.4 btc they used my address 3 times more to receive btc and send it out .
I only noticed what happend today when i wanted deposit some other bitcoin on the wallet . I did not checked the iphone why would i . it was closed and secure how i tough.
@_date: 2019-09-17 13:31:12
Tell me someone who could pay me i need get 2.4 btc back

Answer from blockchain.info
I am so sorry to hear this. A wallet can become compromised when login credentials, the backup phrase, or pairing code are accessed by a third party. A malicious third party may attempt to deceive users into unknowingly providing this information. Tactics can include phishing sites and emails, and social media scams impersonating Blockchain or a Blockchain employee. 
With a Blockchain wallet, you are in sole control of your funds, which means Blockchain does not have the ability to reverse, cancel, or refund lost funds. This is partially due to how cryptocurrency transactions work, and because our wallet is non-custodial. 
The following best security practices play a very important role in preventing loss of funds:
\- Never share your backup phrase or pairing code. A third party can use either to access your funds even if you have two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled and change your password. Blockchain will never ask for your backup phrase or pairing code.
\- Never give a third party wallet access, or allow a third party to create a wallet for you. 
\- Please take measures to secure your email, and the computer or device used for wallet access. This may involve running a malware scan or consulting an IT professional.
\- Avoid phishing sites or social media scams by bookmarking important links including [ and [
If a wallet becomes compromised, it should not be used to hold funds. Please visit [ and create a new wallet with a new, unique password. Before sending funds to this new wallet, complete all Security Center steps under the Basic tab. This includes verifying your email, enabling 2FA, and making a backup. Only enable Advanced tab settings that you are comfortable with. 
Mobile users can create a new wallet using our iOS or Android apps. Tap the main menu &gt; Settings to verify the email and set up 2FA. Also from the main menu, tap “Backup Funds” to make a backup.
Please make a record of your new wallet ID, password, and backup phrase to store somewhere safely, offline. As a non-custodial wallet, we do not have the ability to reset passwords or retrieve a backup phrase, which is why it is so important for you to store this information. If you have any remaining funds at your compromised wallet, you can send them to a receiving address generated within your new wallet.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
