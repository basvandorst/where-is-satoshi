cryptos were already being used as a way to transfer wealth outside of the city so that is why they are halting trading as of the end of this month. one of the main reasons people were moving money outside is because there are better investment opportunities. 
your understanding of china banking system is limited. banks in china are owned by the government, as in they are part of the government. a high level manager is also considered a high level government official. that is pretty basic knowledge, so given that i don't see how you can make the assumption that because of what happened with cyprus that its going to happen in china? now that is laughable. you comparing two countries with different populations, regulations, and wealth and saying that because something happened to "A" then it will happen to "B"? 
china is very careful with their economy and if you can't use western ideals to explain china. china is very very different in the way they value and think about things.

thank you. but you were kinda being a dick this whole time. anyways there is no hard limit and yes i understand that they will investigate any suspicious activity. i live in china and although i just started actively trading bitcoin in china, i do follow crypto currency news fairly closely and i am merely offering my opinion on the matter just like everybody else. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 07:28:16
ok. where does it say there is a limit on how much bitcoin i can buy? i see a limit on how much i can withdraw on a daily limit. they do not state i am only limited to an equivalent of 50k usd.  


this is how they are defining crypto currency so seems like it is not the same has foreign exchange. so seems like i can still bypass the bank on the 50k usd limit. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:53:23
the way they transfer wealth via btc is to first buy btc right? where do they buy? exchanges. there is a limit to how much you can exchange into USD for each chinese citizen, that number is 50k usd a year, if i'm not mistaken. btc lets them bypass that. so thats why china is probably going to ban exchanges.

I'm not treasuring the banking system in china. I'm just pointing out how some of the points you bring up are not good examples to use as assumptions on what will happen to china. And your obvious distaste for china keeps you from really understanding china. I'm not saying that everything you say does not have merit but you need to get off your western high horse and thinking you understand a country you know little about. Gotta get in China on the ground level. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 09:40:25
i am also wondering this as well. somebody please answer this question. i do think that maybe because only chinese people can buy from china online platforms because you need chinese ID cards so maybe thats why no big players are doing it?
@_date: 2017-09-20 11:00:08
some good food for thought. i def was not thinking about the network as wallets as well but that does make sense since its peer to peer. more hype!!! more buy!!!
Edit: is it just me or when there is actual good info and theory supporting bitcoin or cryptos in general people don't pay attention and only upvote shit theories that jump to conclusions with failed logic? I feel like most people don't understand the overall big picture of cryptos and bitcoin. Or maybe I'm the dumbass here? Haha
@_date: 2017-09-14 06:52:03
i'm not saying people at top don't want pie. maybe they do, maybe they don't. but how you got to those assumptions are pretty far fetched.

Need ID and upload documents to exchange site. The big ones are btcchina, huobi, and I think okcoin. The verification process takes up to 24 hours. After that you need to link your bank account. I just got into bitcoin and just bought my first coins on Monday on btcchina but haven't withdrawn it yet so I dunno how that part goes. It is selling at China for a discount at the moment. 
Edit: by your bank account I mean your friends because the account should match the ID or else might have issues. Because China is cracking down on money laundering and rmb leaving the country. That is why there might be a ban on exchanges in china not because they are messing with pricing. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:27:12
That just doesn't seem very likely to me. I dunno. Ask some other Chinese classmates how likely people are to borrow money from loan sharks to buy something based on speculation. I don't think it is very likely. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 16:11:52
I would def not trust an ATM at a random coffee shop to buy bitcoin. Sounds very close to a scam. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 06:26:31
because you don't agree with what i wrote then i don't understand what is going on? i wrote this is a bigger reason for ban/regulation than people saying china wants to horde coins etc. 
as far a moving money out of the country, with bitcoins you can buy a bunch of coins and transfer it to a wallet without any restrictions right now. correct? there are no restrictions on buying bitcoins in rmb but maybe i'm a small fish so i don't know. but you are right in the KYC (know your customer part) and there are daily limitations but still more than what is allow by banks and the transfer is much much faster. 
they know who is buying but can't really control moving it outside of china. i think china also knows that they can't control it so they regulate the exchanges, limit number of coins that can bought, limit the amount of coins that can be withdrawn. right now with bitcoin you can move more than 50k usd. my current exchange allows for up to 50 coins at a time. so i dunno man. if you know more please shed some knowledge on me. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:04:10
It doesn't make sense to me why Chinese people would borrow heavily in order to buy something this new and unproven. The reason I question this is because it seems uncharacteristic of the masses to behave this way.  
Edit: also getting a loan in china is difficult.  so not sure where these people are getting loans from.

Not weird but you probably a homo.

I am similar to your situation (not super rich but well off). just dropped 10k into bitcoin early this week which is what the price is right now. losing 10k would suck but wouldn't be the end of the world for me. it was either bitcoins, stock, or index fund. decided on bitcoin because the rewards outweigh the risk (risk being losing all 10k) for me. 
the things i like about bitcoin is that it is the front runner by a wide margin imo. it is limited in supply (makes me feel that it will def go higher if crypto currency becomes a thing), and simple (which makes adaption much easier). 
so if you are like me then go ahead and do it. mainly because it seems like losing 10k won't put you in any financial trouble. 
edit: oh and it is decentralized which is really awesome as well.

I would not trust a bitcoin ATM in china. I don't even trust atms that are not directly in the bank because scammers put keypads and card readers on that shit and get your info and steal your money. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 12:25:52
if you want to avoid bank and atm fees while travelling and you are in the US then get yourself a schwab debit card. its a free checking and no atm fees worldwide! and best customer service in the business imo. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 15:28:34
Finally somebody saying something with some sense instead of all these conspiracies and fud about china trying to drop the price of crypto so they can buy it all smh 
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:30:07
Chinese mentally is so different for why they do things that you can't compare to any other culture. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:33:45
you explained it alot better than me lol. yea they probably gonna regulate and not straight up ban. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:03:12
i know they are not banning bitcoin outright. i started this by saying that i see alot of people saying they are banning crypto on here and trying to clear things up. 
you just said so yourself that the government can't ban crypto right? so the way to do it is make it harder to obtain and sell the crypto right? thus banning exchanges. but there has been no official word of that yet. i
@_date: 2017-09-14 07:16:00
i know about conversion limits for fiat but i don't think bitcoin is put under that classification. can you provide me a legit source for this? i can't find anything about it online. i called but didn't get through to anybody.
@_date: 2017-09-14 06:54:05
but i am not converting because i can buy in rmb. i don't have to convert to any currency to buy bitcoin in china. so i dunno why you are bringing up the currency conversion issue.
@_date: 2017-09-14 07:08:11
i am literally on my exchange website and says nothing like that. if it is the law then it would be stated on the exchange website. no? 
@_date: 2017-09-12 16:00:02
To buy on China exchange you need to have Chinese ID card. Not sure about localbitcoins though. But beware of scammers. There are a lot of them here. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:07:07
read sidebar?
@_date: 2017-09-14 07:05:12
im on my exchange website right now and do not see a limit on how much i can transfer into my account or how much bitcoin i can buy. you have a source for limitation on buying btc? 
@_date: 2017-09-12 13:09:30
lol yea he def did. lucky mofo. but he will pass down his coins on to me right? ....right guys?.... 
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:25:49
i don't understand why people keep saying china is against bitcoin and how they are trying to hoard it all themselves etc. yall must not understand shit about what is going on in china. 
the reason it is so widely traded in china is because it is a vehicle for money laundering and moving money outside of china. that is why china is probably going to ban exchanges, not crypto, but EXCHANGES. they also banned ICO because when crypto first came into china there were tons of SCAMS and people were getting scammed left and right. it was a huge headache for the government so they just banned to make things simple. everybody thinks their primary concern is limiting growth but the reasons they put regulations were not to limit its growth, it was to deal with issues that crypto was causing in china. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 12:16:46
i don't know when it will happen again. i just happen to be at right place at right time.
i actually just got into bitcoins. and the reason is because my dad has called me TWICE in the past couple of weeks to specially ask if i have bitcoins yet because it is so low (first time was when it was 27k rmb, roughly 4100usd, and a second time this past saturday when it was 23k rmb, roughly 3500usd). the significance of the call is because:
1. he NEVER calls me. EVER. to talk about anything. and now he's called me twice about bitcoins. he invested a good amount in november 2016. 
2. he is the most skeptical and conservative mofo i know. and he is all about bitcoins. he has been a computer engineer all his life so he understands all this crypto mumbo jumbo that i don't understand. 
i also want to address this notion of chinese putting out "fake news" to fuck with market price.
1. i don't think its fake news because the report came from a very credible chinese news source that publishes pretty spot on news BEFORE official announcement. 
2. is the chinese governemnt putting out news to fuck with the market? i dunno, maybe? but i do know that the chinese government is actively trying to fight money laundering and money leaving the country and that is what people are using bitcoin for. chinese government is NOT banning bitcoins, they are banning exchanges. that is definitely something they can and will probably do. speculation on this side of the pond is this will probably happen sometime before the national congress on october 18, 2017. so definitely stay tuned. when it does happen the price in china will most likely drop a good amount since it is not as liquid as before, people will definitely be selling. when this happens i will be ready to buy. not sure how other foreign markets will be effected but if this weekend was any indication then bitcoin in china market will be lower that other markets. 
the leak about china banning exchanges came out friday evening in china i believe. after the call saturday from my dad i am looking seriously into bitcoins because of the reasons stated above. so im on this sub reading everything. current price as i'm reading is 22k rmb, roughly 3300usd. by mid afternoon i feel i have a good grasp of what i'm investing in. but to open and verify an account takes up to 24 hours. have to wait till probably monday. FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU. so kinda upset because i know that by monday if no official word from the chinese government comes out to say that they are banning exchanges that the price will shoot up. and yes, it did shoot up. by the time i got my account verified and funds transferred it already gone up about 3k rmb, roughly 500usd. all said and done i ended up buying at 25k rmb, roughly 3800usd. still happy with the price since it is still alot cheaper than other foreign markets. and now i'm strapped in and along for the ride with you guys. 
tldr: just got into bitcoin and got lucky with timing.
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:55:30
I dunno if they do or not but it is not the main reason behind the bans like what everybody thinks. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:45:40
they are banning exchanges so people can't buy bitcoins to do that. if you already have the bitcoins then its hard for them to stop you. thats why they are banning exchanges, to make bitcoins harder to obtain. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 10:43:04
Could it be that maybe it's not china causing the FUD? ��
@_date: 2017-09-12 11:27:40
as a chinese i can confirm that i am buying coins at a discount
edit: added "a"
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:41:58
i'm saying alot of people on here are saying china is going to ban crypto or bitcoin, but they are banning exchanges. just trying to stress that point. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 07:02:47
i'm talking about your assumption that china wants a piece of the action because of the chinese economy?  and your assumption that taiwan and japan can overtake china? was this what your source told you? 
i am skeptical you have friends in china given how much you bash china and think chinese people are dumb. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 08:04:37
but you were talking about your assumptions like they were facts so yea...
@_date: 2017-09-14 06:23:35
if you think the only  reason is because chinese government wants a piece of the action then i don't think you fully understand things that are going on in china. i think the main reason for regulation of crypto currency is because of money laundering and moving wealth out of the country. 
i also don't see how buying bitcoins will solve china's economic issues now. bitcoin is so new that i feel we are still a bit aways from adopting it to solve a whole country's economic issues. your assumptions are pretty far fetched. 
and you think taiwan and japan can take over china in 2 weeks? are you serious? even if no nuclear weapons you think taiwan and japan has a chance? you obviously don't know anything about the chinese military. you must not be working with high level military and/or government officials if that is your outlook.  
don't think china is a powerhouse? if the market rumbles based on regulation that china sets for people of its own country, does that not make it a powerhouse? i'm not saying power house in everything but in some things they are.
