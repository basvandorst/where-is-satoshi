Human rights criminal, murdered wrongly incarcerated individuals, corruption shady economic management and crashed currencies. If a state did this sort of thing, does that make them shitty and not to be trusted? Like if they did these things globally. Really makes you think.

I said criticising Israel does not make you anti Semitic. Is that not true?
@_date: 2018-04-07 11:23:27
Lmao. Some trail, you’ll actually find there is one comment and it’s about a smear campaign, in which people who disagree with policy are not anti Semitic. The irony of this seems to be lost on you.

So your saying I’m an anti Semite because I don’t like Ben Shapiro? 
@_date: 2018-04-07 10:54:48
Ben Shapiro is not a liberal lefty. Have you even heard of Ben Shapiro?

When you believe people should act in the way you find acceptable in their personal lives and that should be backed up by law, your socially authoritarian. Also if you believe people’s capital should be protected over personal freedom of others and that’s all you have to say about it, then your not an intellectual,

I’m sorry if your referring to my comment history then you clearly haven’t read it.

He really doesn’t. This guy is an utter spaz and was drummed out of British politics because he’s inept. Using this video and getting this many upvotes in this sub, makes me worried for it.

He’s really passionate about all sorts of things. Transgender rights he hates, abortion he passionately hates. Economically libertarian and socially authoritarian, otherwise known as retarded.

But not in the case of personal freedom. Financially liberal but socially authoritarian

I have never posted anything about terror. Your out of your mind. My posts can all be read so I don’t know why you’d claim that. Maybe up your prescription. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 11:18:34
Your post is as clear as mud. You said “you are against the liberal left like him” What does anti semitism have to do with anything you nutter.

He is also an illogical bullshitter. If this is who the American right hold up as their intellectual Titan it speaks volumes. In the land of the blind the one eyed man is king.

Buys environmentally friendly car with, on an astronomical scale, the least environmentally friendly currency ever. Tfw

Ben Shapiro is not a libertarian
