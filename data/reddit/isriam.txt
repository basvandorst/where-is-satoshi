thats funny, in about it says the project is called bitcoin core.
From 2011 to 2013, the site was primarily used for releasing new versions of the software now called Bitcoin Core. In 2013, the site was redesigned into its current form, adding numerous pages, listing additional Bitcoin software, and creating the translation system. Developer documentation was added in 2014.

the developers state its a 'store of value' so how is it not supposed to be about price?

this is such a scam title.  amount of users has nothing to do with those networks.  technology does.  its like saying buses are slow because they haul a lot of people.  well they don't have to be slow, airplanes really solved that problem and carry a lot more people than busses.

you keep saying that while you watch the market cap and alt coins increase in value.  not only do they increase in value and visibility, they are doing transactions better than bitcoin.
we waited for 10 years because the crypto market wasn't invented yet.  where it is today is an entry point into the market, and now hundreds of competitors.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:57:27
kinda sad, i know the idea is send it with a 'high enough' fee, but when thats a shot in the dark and 5-10 dollars leaves a transaction hung for 20+ hours, something should be done to help.

this is real money, this isn't an example of patience.  bitcoin network is 2009 technology, waiting to be upgraded.  until that upgrade, people are going to complain.  we bitch about coinbase not having segwit, but we don't have lightning.  the technology should be ahead of the adopters.

yea, lately theres a lot of scare stories about bitcoin blockchain trackers and whatnot, who owns the most bitcoin blah blah.  monero doesnt work like that.  you dont know who has what unless they show you, and then when you send it, its mixed by the protocol so no one knows who paid whom.

the reddit, not the post.  the post was just a link i had handy.

why would you store your value in btc and not ltc? thats the perplexing problem.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:54:53
lets give it 2 years while the fees go higher.  i'm sure everyone will be lining up to buy bitcoin then.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:26:11
the timescale is 10 minutes per block.  2mb blocks vs 1mb blocks is 2x the space.

@_date: 2017-12-20 03:49:49
no, but i do believe people are learning about high fees and the price to send cryptocurrency.  honestly i think btc and bch lose it all to other coins.

obviously segwit wasn't the answer then right?
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:04:25
id say 90% of our posts are about bitcoin, prices, memes, and general news, and 90% of posts are about how bitcoin core sucks, how is censoring, and how bcash is going to be the real btc ticker.  its pretty annoying when i read about it here, but luckily its only 10% of our posts.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:42:54
you're wrong actually, satoshi did know how much visa transacted, and did talk about it.  big blocks were discussed as a scaling problem by satoshi, but the bigger issue at the time was using the blockchain for other stuff which they wanted to stop.  there are some interesting reads about bitcoin scaling in the early 2009 2010 days.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:12:07
i dont know why its a big deal either.  if you want to get involved with the blockchain, install a full node and validate with it.  if you only care about payments, use a spv wallet and move on your day.  i dont think we want everyone running a full node on their phones and laptops.  but what do i know.

I bought my first btc in 2013 at the ath 600 USD. I almost sold all but decided to just forget about it. In 2017 it made me a very happy person. Imagine how strong the FUD was back then when it was worth little and was only used on the dark net. At least today you have hodl support. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:41:18
oh, i'm educated.  thats why i don't understand the philosophy around a lot of these posts.  if someone wants to sell bitcoin, let them.  if bitcoin goes up, awesome.  its a great technology with a lot of investors and use cases.  that doesnt mean it's perfect.

thats their choice, but its not possible to tell people to stop using them if its their only avenue to buy btc.  would you rather them buy btc, or not use coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:04:57
who invented this "store of value"?  Thats pretty dumb.  Its only valuable as a hedge against other crypto's, nothing else.  If there is another currency that is fast, usable, and secure, why in the world would you even need bitcoin to store anything?
comparing it to gold is wrong, gold has gone from 500 an oz to 1800 an oz over 30 years.  you can't easily trade it for goods, you can't turn it into fiat easily.  cryptos can be converted in 2 seconds, and if you have to spend 50 dollars to convert bitcoin to monero, why would you not just buy monero to begin with?

i agree, i tried to shapeshift some bitcoin this week and a tx got stuck.  i couldn't imagine if it was something super important.  and i'm not talking about 2 sat/b fees.  fees that are hundreds are being dropped.  please UASF the block increase to 2mb or something, because this is a constant issue that is going to make no one use bitcoin, even for a "store of value".
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:08:31
where do you get the idea that normal people can't run full nodes if the blocksize is 2mb or 4mb?  are you saying shitty companies like coinbase and xapo are controlling bitcoin and its users right now because users cant use the blockchain?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:54:18
those coins are tied to bitcoin a lot, so when it crashes they typically do also.  some people hold alts thinking they will go up when btc does, and they dont.  the best thing in my opinion is to hold btc up and down, and to buy alts as you can to help hedge.  notice i said help, they are all volatile.
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:18:06

@_date: 2017-12-14 14:41:09
why store your money in bitcoin then? what separates its value from litecoin? just the fact bitcoin is going up in price?
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:57:13
thats stupid.  go send ripple or raiblocks and you'll see how slow these original cryptos are.  us allowing anything else is really just stubbornness on our part.  bch, btc, ltc, and eth are dinosaurs.

if that was the only issue i think this sub would handle both groups well, but its got bch users/manipulators calling bch "theirs" and using their companies to make money off people buying bch.  bitcoin core are developers that seem to want the best, but with no timeline for how to get it.  bch probably will maintain as an alt of bitcoin, but bitcoin really need to fix the scaling issue faster than "in the next few years".
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:50:17
what makes it digital gold, and litecoin not?
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:49:11
its a method to remove some of the overhead in blocks/transactions so they are smaller and more fit into a block.  basically.
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:15:47
maybe try litecoin or something, not btc.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:52:41
of course.  i understand the new technology being added, but i do not understand how we can sustain the current growth and keep bitcoin relevant.  when satoshi invented this thing, there was nothing else.  he was competing against failed technology.  that isn't the case any more and blockchain is very much a proven technology with lots of use cases exactly like his original whitepaper.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:44:15
maybe you haven't looked around lately.  there are lots that fit the free world crypto motto.  monero for one.

@_date: 2017-12-10 13:30:20
My take is BTC will see 26 to 29 thousands soon.  Maybe before 1 Jan.  Then it will continue to grow over 35-40-45k.  I am going to buy BTC as it dips lower 14K.  Hope, this scenario will work.

i would say the same if it werent for bch trying to damage bitcoin and the capital it has today.  i take it personal when they want to crash btc and make it bch long term.  we should work on fixing btc if there are issues with it, not trying to scam people into making them (ver) more money while holding btc.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:29:04
what do you mean "we hate those people", "hate their fork"?  do you mean because you see up voted memes and people talking about ver that everyone here hates bch and people who think btc has a scaling problem?  dont believe the hype, both forums have liars and manipulators.

core are smart, and they are not totally against blocksize increase.  they could not see the future and the rush to buy/use btc in the past month.  satoshi did, and that is why he asked wikileaks to not use btc in the past because it was not ready.  we cannot stop this investment train now.

Imagine bitcoin is the invention of radio waves.  A new means of communication.  We have cell phones, emergency services, and other methods to use that great invention.

you realize you're talking about a human doing something better than a machine can.  i think its silly these wallets can't determine what fee's are going in each block, the current mempool, and what would be the cheapest fee to be confirmed next.  websites can do it right?

in their defense, when you're talking about money, you want it safe and secure.  you don't want someone to hack bitcoin or take over bitcoin.  the bitcoin blockchain should be the most secure method of storage of money in history.
that being said i dont know that bitcoin is that or will be that, based on the attacks and network state.  the fact bcash has more blocks etc is concerning.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:18:15

@_date: 2017-12-05 13:54:55
Technology evolves.  BCH is concerned with the "white paper" and "cost" of sending bitcoin.  BTC is concerned with the underlying network, and the ability to remain safe without spamming.  I think in the end, BTC will have to raise blocksize, but only because that gives a quick fix to the backlog.  I have no problem with 2MB or 4MB blocks (segwit anyone?) but quadrupling the current size without any future roadmap is a disaster in my opinion.  BCH has no future ideas beyond block size.

[–]almkglor 3 points 1 day ago 
I honestly don't know what Blockstream's business model is, but I've never seen any information about how they will be making ill-gotten profits from creating open source software like the lightning network.
Blockstream's business model is the Liquid Network, which is a federated sidechain to be used between exchanges and large-scale Bitcoin users. Suppose you have a Coinbase account and want to pay someone with a Bitfinex account. Now suppose, Coinbase and Bitfinex are part of the Liquid Federation controlling the Liquid Network. Instead of using the Bitcoin blockchain to pay, Coinbase and Bitfinex use the Liquid Network, which is faster (since it is not mined by an anonymous set of miners, but is instead signed by a fixed set of blocksigners i.e. the Federation, it does not have to worry about block sizes and propagation delays as much as the public Bitcoin network does); so you can pay using your Coinbase account to the payee's Bitfinex account by using Coinbase and Bitfinex as intermediaries. Blockstream will be part of the Liquid Network and will get part of the fees involved in Liquid transfers. Obviously the Liquid Network will be centralized around the Liquid Federation and particularly around Blockstream; the hope was that only Liquid would centralize, with the base Bitcoin network remaining decentralized and distributed.
Notice how the above is very similar to what is commonly accused of Lightning (you need to entrust your funds to some third party which gives you IOUs (i.e. the exchanges who make up the Liquid Federation), it's a sidechain where Blockstream gets a cut of fees, it will lead to a centralized upper-layer network, etc). Many arguments against Lightning are almost entirely composed of conflations of Liquid and Lightning.
However, Lightning is different from Liquid. It was initially developed by Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja both academics at MIT. At first only them academics could understand it, then Rusty Russell got drunk, read the paper three times, then wrote a blog disassembling the whole thing for the rest of us (I am sensationalizing here). Then Blockstream hired him and told him to build Lightning, leading to the "Reaching the ground with Lightning" and the lightning-rfc, and the projects to implement the Lightning BOLT specs.
Lightning does not need to entrust funds to a third party: you only entrust funds to the correct operation of the Bitcoin blockchain (and if you're using Bitcoin at all, you are entrusting funds to the Bitcoin blockchain correct operation anyway). Blockstream gets no larger cut of the fees other than operating Lightning nodes that are channeled to services that users want to pay to, which any of us, in principle, can also do (unlike Liquid where membership of the Federation is by invitation only).
Blockstream has two devs working solely on Lightning (Christian Decker and Rusty Russell), and 1.5 devs working solely on Bitcoin Core (Pieter Wuille and Greg Maxwell as the 0.5 dev, since he moonlights as Blockstream's CTO when he's not trolling rbtc with his imaginary millions of sockpuppet accounts).
Lightning potentially will destroy Liquid, simply because Lightning is decentralized and has pretty low barrier-to-entry (at least when Lightning implementations get completed). Blockstream still helps build it anyway even if it could threaten their business model.

you shouldn't have said the last line.  the rest of it sounded ok until you got to shilling other alts.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:10:16
Then I agree with you completely about scaling and research.  I do not agree though that this is a shitpost.  I think its probably someone like the 90% of the other users who heard about bitcoin on the news, and bought it thinking it was the best thing since sliced bread, like we shill to the public.
I'm all aboard the crypto train, but I do not lie to new buyers about the current network status of bitcoin, and how confusing it is to manage wallets and keys.  That is why I don't think bitcoin is ready for the mainstream, and really not much else is.  Maybe Ripple, just because the desktop wallet is so completed and easy to use.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:40:16
you're wrong then, look at purse.io and look at the growth of the btc value.  of course we want to use it for retail transactions right now!
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:26:10

ethereum has some major problems, litecoin is not as good as bitcoin cash, and monero is the end game.  read about them and you'll understand why monero is going to last the longest and why it might even take over for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:13:32
interesting, i havent heard that before, it makes sense but its not really evident on the chart?
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:56:40
LN won't be used for years.  We all know that.  Do you think BTC can sustain this current rise in new users/transactions over time or will people leave to other currency's that work today?  I'm all for btc but at some point it has to be usable, around the spam transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:38:59
i'm in the same boat, 24 hours with 76 sat/byte.
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:54:23
hell yes, if they are so hell bent on pushing segwit, they should be promoting it as the bitcoin solution.

@_date: 2017-12-22 02:05:31
You realize people aren't actually using it at those fees right?. They are selling it asap to try and save some money. I'd say all of those transactions are from wallets to exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:01:03
every week.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:45:00
the idea is that segwit and on chain compression have to happen long term, LN has to happen long term, and big blocks have to happen long term.  None of them are OK by themselves.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:12:13
right, so if you fill up blocks with 1 sat/byte, you have to send 2 sat byte to get in the next block, which really pushes all users higher than 1 sat/byte right? which is spam and pushing fees higher?  Just trying to follow how its possible 84mb of 1sat/byte transactions wouldn't raise the price and fill the mempool with garbage?
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:01:13

I don't think most people understand that this is why fee's continue to rise.  You can look at the mempool over time and it just blows me away that people would attempt to sabotage the network.

Ach transfers still take time so I buy on coinbase and send out for free via gdax. You can also buy free on gdax if you'd like. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:44:08
but with more companies coming to this industry how are we going to make users voices heard? by stamping out their transactions?  so sorry, coinbase is flooding the network with transactions that arent segwit, so you have to wait.
my transaction was from trezor with a segwit address and 76 sat/b transaction.  it was frozen for 25 hours until i tipped someone to push it into a block for me.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:51:25
peer to peer electronic cash was invented prior to the 1300 alts that exist today.  if satoshi knew what the future held he probably would have reworded the white paper.  technology changes, sticking to the white paper is like saying 640k of ram is all a pc needs.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:45:54
segwit is not going to help when we've seen 10x the traffic if not more coming to bitcoin.  i love segwit and LN, but i feel we're in the place that satoshi didn't want with wikileaks.  too much attention before the network is ready.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:39:53

bitcoin would be in a different situation if it were the only cryptocurrency.  it not longer has that title, so it needs to be able to compete.  when you can flip a switch and go from one currency to another, you're losing your goal of being a store of value.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:48:59
the idea is that bigger blocks is not the method to scale.  the teams who support wallets and other infrastructure could do more to help scaling like implement segwit addresses which allows much more density in the block.  
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:53:47
i sent from a segwit address to shapeshift with a 76 sat/byte transaction and its pending 24 hours.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:23:48
if you google you'll find that some are authorized resellers by the ledger or trezor company.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:24:52
so why are all blocks 1mb? honestly i'm miffed, i had a 76sat/byte transaction stuck for 25 hours.  thats a huge fee for bitcoins design.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:47:13
there is a member of reddit that has helped me in the past when i did 10-20 sat, so i figured looking at mempool and stuff 70sat would take 1-2 hours.  no way did i think 24 hours.

@_date: 2017-12-21 17:36:18
in that regard, why wouldn't we open the "lanes" and allow more users?  I really hate to say it, but bitcoin is 2009 technology.  There are new cryptocurrencies that do not require mining, do not pre-mine coins, and instant transfers up to 7,000 tps.  I need bitcoin because it's a huge investment for me, but I don't understand why we can't have both bigger blocks, and smaller blockchain via compression?
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:27:57
bch does not have segwit.  i think LN requires larger blocks anyway.

you don't just tell the world we'll fix pollution by reducing emissions of cars over 30 years.  you start right away, and when cars are going 40-60mpg you remove those regulations you put in place to help in an emergency.  that is why i don't understand the big block vs small block.  we need changes asap, but i dont think we will always need big blocks.

well lets compare it to what else is available as "digital cash" then.  Ripple has 2.5 second transactions, and Litecoin has 2.5 minute blocks.  If you were going to send cash from A to B, which would you choose?  Do you want it 100% private and fungible?  Then you'd probably want Monero.
See the issue here?  Bitcoin can be the entry point, the basis of all of this, but if its unusable, there isn't much point in calling it a "store of value", or "peer to peer cash" because it's not better than other options.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:56:31
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:20:05
its more about the futures markets based on coinbase price i think.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:39:49
You have to realize though, that "companies" are not in charge of bitcoin.  Architects/Engineers are.  Would companies have outages if Engineers ran them, and tested all the code completely?
I'd say the fact there is a roadmap and testing of new features shows that the design behind bitcoin is more about proof it works and works well, before fixing issues generated by the community unless there is an outage.  High fees is actually designed into Bitcoin, so the most important transactions get through first.  I don't like it, but its the original design. The more congestion, the more cost goes up, until the congestion is relieved.  The same would happen if all miners left.  That is the design.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:54:29
or support other cryptos?  thats the only issue i see here is people use bitcoin as a stepping stone to open their eyes to the entire world of crypto.  at that point bitcoin is nothing but a place to make money on new users.

you're telling people to be patient while they are losing money.  i don't understand why we say the blocks would be full? if you double the size of the network, wouldn't half the mempool go away? or do we really think someone is spamming the network?  If they are spamming the network, would we say bitcoin is not a useful store of value?
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:06:02

The real deal is big money transactions like wires.  They still take a long time to validate, even if it is an hour.  ach between banks takes days still.  bitcoin will take over both of those actions fairly easily i believe.
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:52:35
i think you'd have to pay 10k to mine enough to equal 1k.  something like that.  don't even think you're earning 6 coins with an s9.  maybe like .03 or something.  i got into mining also and its cool and fun, but you won't make enough to offset your expenses.

make sure you store your bitcoins in an offline paper wallet.  not in an exchange.
@_date: 2017-08-28 14:33:26
depends on what you mine.  bitcoin, no.  ethereum? yes. for a bit.  remember you'll be burning up your hardware, using electricity, to make 20 bucks a month.  not to mention the noise and effort.  its good to learn, not good to make a profit.

@_date: 2017-08-31 02:43:36
try mining some easy coin like ether or something.  you'll make enough you understand mining, and you can sell it for some $$.  then you can learn exchanges, and all that jazz.
all the while, leave your btc in your wallet to grow.  don't make mistakes with btc because it will kill you.  i deleted a wallet.dat file last week that contained 1btc and almost had a heart attack.  found it in my recycle bin.  you don't want to play with btc if you invest heavily.  unless you can afford the loss, which i can't.
oh i put off on a hardware wallet for 4 years, but trezor is the shizzle.  i'm no longer worried about my keys.  if you can afford it, its worth it.  if not, paper is the next best.  put your btc on a paper waller and then spend time mining and trading litecoin or other cheap coins.  you can get lucky with other coins also.
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:07:06
use gdax which is coinbase.

your 100 could be 0 or it could be 2500.  don't expect it to turn into millions, you're too late for that.  that would be like investing .50 4 years ago and expecting to own 900 btc.
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:41:18
exactly my point.  You're guessing.  Just like those that say its worth 3.50 and those that say its 7500.  all coins including bitcoin have exchanges and markets for day traders, and we've all made and lost money doing it.  holding is for long term.

thats dumb.  all good things change and morph into better.  you shouldn't stick with something just because the original design was cool, you should be open minded to see what is next on the horizon.
AOL was the greatest thing ever in 1997.  No one ever imagined an internet beyond it.  Whether bitcoin becomes bch or btc, its all about becoming better.  I think bitcoin core wants to change and grow, and bitcoin cash wants to stay the same but just add 1 feature that does nothing for long term growth.

Good point, some applications refuse to work unless updated to current version.  Lets say you have walletA app, and when you turn on wifi it does a version check, and tries to update but says you must be on IOS14.  Your device doesn't support IOS14.  Would you be SOL?  I guess you'd need walletA to support bip39 aka seed words?

stop buying, and start putting your fiat into other investments.  you can send some btc to localbitcoins and cash it out, or you can just leave it and start saving via other methods.  you don't need 100% of your net worth tied up in btc, you can diversify like you said.  you also don't have to sell your btc to do that.  you say you spent 600 to 950 on bitcoin over the years, start putting that money into the bank and bam, you have your hedge.

coinbase is addressing it but people complain about their failures like high fees and online wallets.
when apple released the first iphone people thought it didn't do enough tech stuff, hell it couldn't even send mms messages.  over time, bitcoin will become less complex and fit into our daily lives easier. the applications on top drive this, and when coinbase has competition, their fees have to drop.

obviously you don't work in the real world.  architects/designers/engineers are the ones who provide safety and help the users.  it comes at a cost, and that is speed.

spend time reading about investments.  while we believe bitcoin can go to the moon, it is still speculative.  again it has better foundations than something like tiny houses, but its a fast climb to the top and a fast fall to the bottom.

seed -&gt; private key -&gt; public key -&gt; addresses
thats my understanding.  you basicailly have the private key in the seed, thats why you shouldn't lose it.  also, the password on your trezor is the 25th word in the seed, so dont write it down.
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:13:17

bitcoin isn't just easy money, so don't think you're going to mine some bitcoin and be rich.  most here purchased when it was 20-500 bucks and just held the asset.  its like real estate, it simply goes up in value and you sell when you like.  that takes a long term plan, not get rich quick scheme.

having debt and buying bitcoin is like an oxymoron.  unless you mean things like a mortgage.  you don't gamble with money you could pay off debt to be free from.  bitcoin is a little better than a gamble.  invest what you can afford to lose but don't stay in debt to do so.
@_date: 2017-09-01 21:29:14

some that were in bitcoins since 2010-2013 have, those from 2014-2015 typically have not.  with prices at like 250 bucks a coin it still took a massive investment to get to 1 million today.  it would have taken 50k investment at 200 a coin to reach 1 million today.  you're looking for people who bought for less than that, which is like 2010-2013 levels.
@_date: 2017-09-20 13:31:53

trezor is a rom (chip) that stores your private key.  It really does nothing else.   it took me awhile to understand it also, but its pretty genius.  no battery, no other requirements.  it creates the private key based on 24 words and 1 password and stores it in memory.  you can recover the private key with those words if you lose the device or it burns in a fire.
you send bitcoins to a public address that is derived from the private address stored in the trezor. you can receive coins all day long to your trezor public addresses, but the private key stays locked away inside its memory in your lockbox or safe.
trezor.io has a link to wallet, and that gui performs the generation of public keys for you.  don't ask me how it doesnt need your private keys, but it doesnt. you can unplug the trezor and still receive money all day long.  you cannot send it without the trezor though.
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:55:56

@_date: 2017-09-14 19:30:36
unless you suspect someone could install some call home code in the device when its plugged in, i don't think i'd worry.  the device can generate different private keys based on a seed, and it looks like you'd know if it were tamped with in and out of the box.  i don't know why someone would sell it locally bnib though.

@_date: 2017-09-09 02:45:34
i'd say thats not really the case with something this simple.  the people who make miners do it specifically for a reason and so its not a broad application that requires years and contracts to make your investment back.  i see it often but i know that typically its best to just spend 5k on 1btc because by the time you start mining, the 500 other people buying antminers raise the difficulty so high you only earn .5btc
i'd say learn how to do it on your pc, mine other cryptos, but dont spend thousands on something from china that has probably already reached its end of life, or isnt profitable to begin with.  i also never trust mining calculators, and typically divide by half what they say i would earn.
now, buying a gpu miner or 5x video cards to mine other cryptos can certainly pay back.  thats why you can't find rx480/rx580/1080 gpu's in stock anywhere.

@_date: 2017-09-18 16:37:22
you need to read about private key, public key, and bitcoin address.  the trezor holds your private key and since it doesnt have a battery or power or internet, someone cant just get your private key out of it.
if your private key is in a text document on your pc, pretty easy to steal right?  thats how i think about the trezor.
@_date: 2017-09-12 17:22:15

@_date: 2017-09-06 13:48:08
really like my trezor interface.  its a physical wallet i can plugin to send money, and i can not plug it in and still receive money.  my "address" is pretty simple, changes automatically, and reminds me of a basic bank interface.  i've been very happy with the change from core to trezor.
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:47:39
yea, they are scammers.
@_date: 2017-09-14 03:02:01
this shows how out of touch forbes really is.
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:33:26
i second trezor. get your coin to it asap.
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:57:38
get whatever is cheaper and faster.  you need it asap.
@_date: 2017-09-20 02:46:23
you need to realize your bank transactions are not free.  the retailer pays for that fee, with the cost being returned to the consume via higher prices.
bitcoin transactions are way cheaper than 1-3% your bank charges the merchant.
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:09:07
yep, i just think it would be funny to reference it also lol.
@_date: 2017-09-07 02:34:00
sure, will it make you any money? no.
mining requirements now are in the range of something like a chicken farm with thousands of graphics cards.  literally thousands if not hundreds of thousands.  its like saying can i start my own phone company.

check craigslist.  a few companies in my area do the same thing already.
@_date: 2017-09-08 23:21:24
nothing.  except for when they buy at 4200, sell at 4300, and it goes to 5000.

software wallets are not safe, as you know from the last time you got scammed.  hardware wallets is something you can carry in your pocket, like cash.  it cannot be stolen in a dark alley and used.  it cannot be stolen with teamviewer.
how can you expect us to take you seriously when you're saying i don't want to be scammed again but don't recommend hardware wallets.
@_date: 2017-09-07 02:38:00
its like the real stock market except there are only 200 stocks, and they are all the same industry, crypto currency.
would you see day traders blowing up the stock exchanges if they could only buy telecom stocks?  no, it works because they can buy gold, tech, medical, real estate, bonds.
crypto can't really make more crypto.  you just buy and hold.  if you want to make money then you sell stuff for bitcoin on craigslist or localbitcoins.
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:09:14

its ok my wife was like who is greg maxwell and why do you care, i'm going back to watching youtube videos on making halloween makeup.
ive read a lot of nullc's replies and felt they were really accurate and spot on.  i guess i should pay closer attention.  luke-jr is ok in my book replied to my stuff also but i have no idea who he is.
@_date: 2017-10-11 19:55:55
not over msrp? you must not have much btc.
@_date: 2017-10-02 17:20:41
nope.  pretend bitcoin is cash.

your hodl link should be to the post explaining the word.
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:52:32
you should have a file called wallet.dat which contains your coins.
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:00:55
We all seem to have that issue on Ubuntu. Someone should fix it

@_date: 2017-10-12 14:08:37
oh, you mean bitfinex no longer taking usd.  it is not closing its doors.  coinbase or gemini i think are the two for usd.
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:14:46
maybe i don't fully understand then.  by running a node (bitcoin.org 15.0.1 on linux) am i not also validating for other bitcoin transactions?  maybe you mean useful for myself?
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:40:38
because that creates a new coin.  they want this to BE bitcoin, not have to implement new wallets and whatnot.
@_date: 2017-09-09 02:13:55
why would they sell something they could simply plug in and make money with?
"hi i have a money tree, you can have it for 10,000 and i promise it will make you 20,000 if you keep it watered for 6 months"

thats the wrong kind of post for this forum.  we need legit answers, and core typically responds with them.  we don't support them because we are robots.
@_date: 2017-10-12 01:21:18
huh? set up a core node and do nothing. what does it have to do with trezor?

bitcoin has always been this way.  every 6 months or so there is a new country banning it.

this happened to me last week with my work laptop.  I figured someone was spying on me, only to realize my wife was testing a new wireless mouse that sync'd to my wireless rx in my work laptop.
@_date: 2017-09-18 01:13:16
thank you, never heard of it and been looking for something like this.  can live off bitcoin this way.
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:48:32
you should let it update.  once its updated, rename wallet.dat in the current bitcoin core folder to wallet_1.dat.  move your wallet.dat into the folder.  it will not have to update but it should show your coins.
it needs to update the blockchain so you can actually verify/send your coins if that is your goal.  your "found" wallet.dat will have the keys you need to show you own the bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:39:55
didn't monero just hard fork like this?
@_date: 2017-10-02 19:48:16
i'm confused then, how are you getting a credit card for someone under 18, thats illegal.
@_date: 2017-10-17 16:41:05
poloniex is terrible, they are scam artists.
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:26:37
what would happen to your bitcoin if coinbase went away?  if the answer is you wouldn't have your bitcoin, then no you do not own it.
@_date: 2017-09-09 02:16:56
i trade with them but i only use like .05 for now.  with the chinese moves i might hold though.  margin funding is few and far between.
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:42:40
no it is not.  get them in a wallet you control.  trezor.
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:04:44
lol i hope you are awake now.

what ever the percentage of growth is will be equal.  Sure 30% of 6k is more than 30% of 1500, but its still 30% growth.  You only get gains by getting in early, which is now.  Your 100 investment could be worth 100k in the future.
@_date: 2017-10-02 16:45:46
the cost on the gear to mine, offsets even the power consumption.  the best bet is to mine something like z and trade it for usd/btc.  even then you have to buy video cards etc or you're talking about only making 3 cents a day with a cpu.
@_date: 2017-10-26 01:06:08

@_date: 2017-09-14 19:30:36
unless you suspect someone could install some call home code in the device when its plugged in, i don't think i'd worry.  the device can generate different private keys based on a seed, and it looks like you'd know if it were tamped with in and out of the box.  i don't know why someone would sell it locally bnib though.
@_date: 2017-09-07 02:32:50
there have been 3 theads in the past 2 days about this.
@_date: 2017-09-07 02:35:04
you need the password to wallet.dat.  you should download bitcoin core wallet/node and try that instead.
also what are the date on the files?  anything &gt; 2015 means the wallet probably has nothing and you've mined shit.
@_date: 2017-10-12 01:23:05
yea, thats why we need miners to control our future along with bitcoin.com and viabtc.

@_date: 2017-10-02 22:55:18
trezor is not your money, it only protects your private key.  you own the "money" because your 24 word seed IS your bitcoin.
this means when btc is forked, because you own your 24 word seed aka private keys, you have access to your coins.  you can load your seed into any wallet that supports seed words, and send your "new" coins to an exchange.
places like coinbase which hold your private key, can decide not to give you your coins from a fork.  which is what they did with bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2017-10-15 09:04:01
diversify.  you should use all types of wallets if you have a large enough investment.

why would 1 user spin up 1000 nodes?  i think if you're a user you should have 1 node to ensure you are validating your transactions.

if you want to buy a tv, you look at the price on newegg, exchange fiat into bitcoin, and then send the bitcoin for the tv.  thats how i do it.  it generates revenue and transactions, and you keep your savings.

if you buy a coin now, you get 2 coins after the fork.  if you buy a coin after the fork, you choose 1 or the other fork to buy 1 coin on.

i know that.  should i have said /s? his bank is acting just like bitcoin.com/nya/big blockers.  they want all the control over bitcoin, just like PNC wants control over this mans money.  bitcoin.org is freedom.
@_date: 2017-09-09 00:05:58
you cant import keys.  just send your btc to the new trezor address.
word of advice, set up the trezor, wipe it, and recover with your seed, then wipe and create a new seed, then send your money.  good practice before you actually send your money over.
