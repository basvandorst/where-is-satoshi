Bored, why did I break a rule or is it just poor form to muse on the number of ducks that aligned this week, resulting in someone profitting a fair bit off of a flaw in the tech?

Actually fair cop, I forgot that a fair part of the exploit was the third party transaction ID...
Once Gox was done it was entirely replicatable by anyone who could identify that flaw - enter the kiddies and the terrible coders.

I'm not making accusations, however Satoshi being anon despite there being a very limited number of people he could possibly be is interesting too.
I'm not saying anyone intentionally backdoored anything - however the old addage "many eyes" as per use in open source missed some issues which in hindsight appear simple.
While it is most likely that issues will occur with any tech, and be reported most, while at its saturation point - this does **feel** like persons waited until the trade-off between saturation and attempts at regulation before hitting the button.
It is interesting - at least mildly to me.

The fact he was banned nearly 20 years ago, and someone believes it relevant (directly) to bitcoin laundering sums up far more...

Ah true, I was prompted to write this as I saw a headline suggesting another two large exchanges down - if Gox was going to pocket the coin and run blaming an old exploit and claiming they were the victim would be one way of doing it.
