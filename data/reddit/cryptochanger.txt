I don't think she is part of the scam... she may be an old lady or something like that... they are using her to get the coins and they will leave her empty.
I wouldn't sell to her if I where you... just because I know there is something fishy in there and I wouldn't like to involve myself on that.

Basically when I bought my miner, I was between buying Bitcoin or the Miner... Bitcoin was around $10 per coin back then, so I could have bought 400 BTC... but I decided buy the miner instead... BFL taked over a year to deliver and only was able to mine 40 BTC so far.
If the would have deliver on time, I would mine the 400 BTC for sure, since reward was 50 BTC back then and the difficulty (even if all the BFL Miner where online) was much less that it is now.
In other words, just buy the BTC instead... chances are you would never mine the BTCs what you could buy today with your fiat.

Unfortunately congressman are more interested in campaign contributions than anything else... and most congressman are in some way receiving donation from Bank &amp; Financial Institutions which benefit from this laws by ensuring low competition and a big barrier of entry to new players.
If you are a entrepreneur looking to innovate on this area, I think leaving the US is the best option at the time.
I hope I could said "I trust the government cares about doing the best for the country" but at this time I can't. I hope I am wrong... time will tell.

Unfortunately, Ripple will pass Bitcoin Market Cap very soon, since they are manipulating the price by limiting the supply of their pre-mined coins to increase the price. I don't think Ripple is a Scam, but is not a fair system for everybody, only founders benefit as the system grown.
