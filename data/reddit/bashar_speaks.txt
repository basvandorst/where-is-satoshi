Most likely error is you copying the wrong address, like a token contract address or something. Not this FUD about omnipotent hackers who take over your OS and spy on your copy-paste functions, and conveniently own every crypto address that is not yours but looks like yours.
Please stop with the FUD.

Amazon is putting Walton RFID chips on all of its merchandise. Trust me, my dad works for Nintendo.

One day at a time man. Do your research, see what happens.
Limit how much time you spend reading crypto subreddits and forums, as you see here, it's full of smug jerks, not great for your mental health.
If you are that mentally ill then sign up for social security/disabiliyt/food stamps, etc.

No this is not a sane market at all. More importantly, it's not a closed system.
It's not outside the realm of possibility that there are whales who will pick sides in the competition between BCC and BTC, driving the price of both upwards.
