Nope, it's  a bad investment because it's been steadily dropping for 18 months and is associated with crime.

So because you made out it's suddenly a good investment?  Bitcoin gained most of its users and notarity during and proceeding the bubble.  That means most people in this subreddit have a cost average much higher than the current price point.  Most people in bitcoin have lost money while a select few reaped amazing returns.  However, nobody has gotten amazing returns in 18 months, and there's nothing on the horizon to suggest anyone invested now will be reaping those same rewards.

Not only that but on April 22nd bitcoin's subscribers per day was cut in half.  All that indicates is that roughly half of bitcoins new subscribers in the few months prior are just bots.  There's been days where there was 2,000 subscribers on a day with no news when the average was 200.

So let me get this straight.  You want to pay a 1% Coinbase fee.  Forfeit your consumer fraud protections which a credit card company gives you (for free).  Forfeit your 1-5% cash back on your credit card.  Pay the extra 1% merchant fees you claim are hidden into the price.  All while PRETENDING to use bitcoin when you make a purchase? (remember you are paying Coinbase in fiat, who pays a merchant in fiat) 
Can you see why mass adoption is not happening?

There has not been one time in bitcoin history where a sharp rise was not followed by a sharp decline.  But yes, this time it's different because you drew lines on a  chart.
