From what I’ve seen on the architecture, LN is a kludge. Too many trade offs.

If it goes up you’re a genius, if it goes down you’re an idiot. But you can do the same thing with lots of other things. If you weren’t already doing it before, you probably shouldn’t start here.

This article seems to me to sound like a self serving advertisement. Sure the idea is fantastic. But the transaction fees on BitCoin are worse than bank transaction fees. &amp;nbsp;
I don't understand how the stated target demographic in Africa is going to be able to overcome the following:&amp;nbsp;
1. required knowledge to use and maintain a crypto wallet
2. be willing to pay and can afford the transaction fees
3. find the basic necessities for living available for sale via BitCoin.
Please explain to me how I'm wrong about this.

You give them money, they buy a select mix of crypto but you don’t get to hold the keys. No matter what happens they get 2% of your money every year, even if the prices go down and you lose. That’s how funds work (although the good ones charge less).

There should be a way to use something like TransferWise to send the money to CoinDesk in a way that your bank does not see where it goes beyond TransferWise.
