Thanks for the feedback! I intend to make the app store the data offline for a period of time before updating with new information (or upon manual reload), so hopefully that will be done soon. As for the icons, I will be changing them. I'll do my best (graphic design was never my forté) to make them look half-decent :P.
Edit: Thanks for the tip by the way! Also, the offline data storing is well underway, so expect to see it in the next update :)

Both my app and Coinmap source the data from OpenStreetMap (looking for places with the proper tag), so they will both have the same data. As for the webaddresses, I realized that after I published it :P. I didn't even think of adding the navigation stuff, so I'll look into a way of doing that. Thanks for the feedback!

You can either use the flag at the top corner of the page, or go to  to always load it in English.

I was also thinking that I'd like to do that for the app I'm making! Maybe I'll bring this idea over to and see if anyone wants to collaborate on it...

Good on you for donating even though it was over! I realize that it's not 1BTC (I am new so I don't have a lot... plus I accidentally forgot the transaction fee when transferring...), but I believe that you should get something!

Given that as time goes on there are less Bitcoins left to be mined and the fact that they are becoming more accepted, probably not. Chances are that they will keep becoming more and more valuable unless something big happens (i.e. they are banned in some countries).

The next hunt has started! Thanks to all who participated in the last one!
