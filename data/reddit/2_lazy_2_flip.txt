It's okay buddy, a lot of people need to learn that lesson first hand in order to understand just how difficult timing the market is.
Just remember that you are still coming out ahead, and still making an investment in what could be the future of currency!

If it makes you feel any better, you aren't the only one who has no idea what this guy is talking about.

Just be careful not to invest more than you are comfortable losing! The last thing you want is to panic sell because you invested so much that emotions get involved - buy it with the plan of holding it for a year at minimum (or prepare to get screwed by the taxes) and hold, hold, hold.
Or max out a few cards and go nuts if you are really risk-tolerant, the above is just, like, my opinion, maaan. =)

Maybe that's the cause of the trouble; you should try coming down first, then buying ;)

Can't forget all the posts complaining about the other posts!
Seriously though, if we want things to change, we have to change.  (Granted, I say this having subscribed maybe two weeks ago, so maybe "we" isn't the best term - sorry if the influx of users has overwhelmed the community as I am part of said influx)
Browsing new and commenting on posts that are linking duplicate articles, or downvoting played out memes, or upvoting those posts which feature high quality content or discussion will all help fix this!
