The same could be said of fiat.....???

BTC can be denominated in dollars as well via the exchange rate and it's still classified as a "virtual currency." So in that context, I don't think classifying gift certificates as a virtual currency is that implausible.

At the end of the day, both "exchanged for" and "denominated in" serve the exact same functionality, regardless if the stated value is variable or fixed. Only difference being that "exchanged for" requires one extra step.
Just because a gift certificate's face value is explicitly denominated in dollars, doesn't mean it's value isn't *negotiable*.. The same thing can be said of BTC; 1 BTC will always be 1 BTC, but it's denominated value in USD will always vary slightly according to what currency exchange you consult.
BTC, dollars, and gift certificates all exhibit the general properties of a currency. Although, admittedly, gift certificates have characteristics of both a security and a currency.

It should have been "In the Blockchain we trust."

That's assuming we don't develop a more advanced method of interplanetary communication!

Unfortunately, I have been far too busy lately to make a really comprehensive reading list; but I will definitely work on one in the future.

I would argue getting a ~real~ education is the only form of protest you'd ever need to take part in. A lot has been done to dumb down the masses, so undoing that would yield drastic results. I would even argue that Bitcoin is an offshoot of this idea since it's composed of amalgamation of other ideas that are not normally discussed in school.

Uhhh, so I still have a chance to buy...! lol

Sounds greatly exaggerated...

Yeah, true... But I had a REALLY strong feeling about BTC back then.. And right now, I'm having the same strong feeling about some of the other cryptos such as LTC. I believe LTC and some of the others will be where BTC is now in ~4 years... I'll be sure to get in on those while the opportunity is still there. :)

Sigh. I don't think I'm going to ever let go of not being able to get in on BTC back when it was trading at $100.. (the first big jump). I distinctly remember telling some friends that I would buy some if I had ANY money and them not taking it seriously.. LOL...

Leave the key pairs to the son...?

Whoaa, this looks super cool.. Will definitely give it a test run in the future. :)

This made me laugh throughout.. I know plenty of the "newbie" traders personally.
