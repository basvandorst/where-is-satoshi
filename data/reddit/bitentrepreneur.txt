Sendcoin will have it's own blockchain, the network will be maintained with Proof of Stake version 2.0 generating 1% interest per annum. There are no transaction fee's. Thus, a transaction fee of 0 to use Sendcoin. 
As for 'spam messages' the SendChat team and I do not see this becoming a huge issue. Not one of us or our friends and family for that matter ever have problems with 'spam messaging' through our other messaging apps, like for example, whatsapp. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 17:28:57
Thanks for the ping.
@_date: 2018-08-02 13:08:48
Umm ok...?
@_date: 2014-12-18 17:11:52
Interesting developments. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 11:45:23
Security is definitely covered; SendChat supports two layers of secure encryption (server-client and client-client). Our encryption is based on 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, RSA 2048 encryption and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange.

This is our goal! An Open Source, encrypted messaging app, with all the perks of a messaging app plus the ability to send Bitcoin &amp; Sendcoin. We are coming out with the product whitepaper very soon. You can stay up to date if you sign up to our newsletter at  Thanks!
@_date: 2014-12-20 20:03:05

@_date: 2014-12-04 16:47:45
Yes, SendChat is 100% open source.
@_date: 2014-12-08 08:39:36
That's not tasty at all

Yes we are, we will add another tab to the site soon. We want to expand into the eastern and latin American markets.
@_date: 2014-12-03 12:31:31
This is true, but we have to agree on a price for the crowdsale, which will also include perks, such as internal team chat with the company, or a chance to read the business plan, internal roadmaps, etc.

@_date: 2014-12-08 11:08:36
The SendChat team doesn't see an issue with introducing Sendcoin. We feel it will introduce more people to the world of cryptocurrency. Furthermore, when using SendChat you can choose to completely ignore it.

We plan on making it cheap! Our only goal is to fund the running of the business behind SendChat. We have a robust business plan in action. Thanks :)
@_date: 2014-12-08 11:52:57
Bitcoin usually takes about 10 minutes to confirm. With Sendcoin confirmations will take approximately 1 minute. There are many possibilities where sendcoin might be more appropriate to use... like in a brick and mortar store for example, you would be able to show your proof of purchase with sendcoin much quicker than with bitcoin (that's if the store accepts sendcoin). 
Sendcoin will also come with stealth address capabilites, lending users an added layer of privacy and anonymity. 
And finally, it will be given to backers of our crowdsale, giving backers the opportunity to help 'kickstart' SendChat. Sendcoin owners/users stand to benefit with SendChat's expansion.
@_date: 2014-12-03 02:26:53
We are working on top of Telegram's open source encryption software. More information about Telegram you can find here:
We feel that SendChat and it's user stand to benefit from Telegrams open source technology, refer to our blog post here:

@_date: 2014-12-08 12:12:46
Well, no. We have Sendcoin added into the SendChat app, however, the mission is still to propagate Bitcoin use in the mainstream. 
I'm sure many in are wary of the amount of scams in the altcoin arena, as are we.
We have two features which build on Bitcoin that will come with the app, one of which is; in-app purchasing which will allow any business already accepting bitcoin to migrate easily into SendChat and sell their services and products.
The second is the Creators Market, which will allow you, me, anyone to upload their own games, photo filters, stickers to SendChat for others to use. The creator of this content could then earn revenue with their own creations and choose to be paid in either Bitcoin or Sendcoin. 
So, this is not just another altcoin with an app tied into it, we are actively trying to get bitcoin into the mainstream with SendChat. 
@_date: 2014-12-08 11:16:00
SendCoin will come with quicker transaction times.

It was a lot of fun, thanks all! - SendChat 
@_date: 2014-12-02 20:53:36
We are going to have a crowdsale which will include other material as well as Sendcoins. The Sendchat team has tried to reach out and contact Telegram for about 3 months now to no avail. We are still not sure how many Sendcoins we will include per BTC, but we will inform everyone about all the details soon.
@_date: 2017-02-11 11:24:46
I care about bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-02 21:32:39
Great question. We have a service called secret chat. All messages in secret chats use end-to-end encryption. Messages cannot be forwarded from secret chats. You can also order your messages to self-destruct in a set amount of time after they have been read by the recipient. The message will then disappear from both your and your friend's devices.
Account verification is done with your telephone number. You cannot get spammed without someone knowing your phone number... just don't give your phone number away so freely, :).
As for off the app, Sendcoin will come with stealth address capabilities. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 22:15:01
Yeah I saw that too

Cool game 
@_date: 2015-01-16 03:01:15
We are currently building these features. The crowdfund is their to help us fund development moving forward. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 23:56:24
Thanks for the feedback.
-Gemz is a counterparty token, so technically it's not an alternative coin with its own blockchain.
-We also don't add that you can check your balance with your electrum wallet...
-50 million users won't work if both iOS and Android are not using Telegram open source code.
- Creators market is a great and fun idea! Check out LINE messaging apps impressive growth ;)
-SendChat Store - is also for businesses ! 
@_date: 2015-01-16 01:30:45
Sure, it's a messaging app; just like Whatsapp and Snapchat, etc. We have many features that intend to create a cryptocurrency ecosystem, that other apps don't have. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 21:38:03
Thanks for your feedback, yes we are holding a crowdfund to continue development of SendChat. SendChat will allow anyone to experience the benefits of Bitcoin, in a simple to use smart phone app. Yes I am part of the talented team behind SendChat.

With SendChat you don't need to invite anyone to use another chat app. With Getgems for example, you need to have Telegram installed to find friends... with SendChat you don't!
SendChat will also support Dogecoin, Sendcoin and Darkcoin!
@_date: 2015-01-31 13:53:55
I'm confident in the industry related to Bitcoin. As for the price, who knows?

@_date: 2015-01-16 01:53:05
Our features include: The ability to connect your debit or credit card account. SendChat store - where businesses can sell their products and services in-app. Creators Market - create games, stickers etc. for cryptocurrency. We also have a news feed plus a badge system in place. We intend to create a sustainable business model.

@_date: 2017-03-28 20:07:06
Plus you have to save your backup PDF before moving further in the web setup process. Additionally, you CAN skip it when signing up in the mobile setup allowing you to do it later. There is nothing we can do with expensive bitcoin network fee's! 
@_date: 2016-01-07 12:29:19
Okay, but why would they do that? There is no reason for them to accept Bitcoin. Take a look at Microsoft for example, there is always an initial boost in sales in Bitcoin, but then it declines heavily. 
So, it would take coinbase's business and sales people to convince Netflix to do it - and that's where it would be very difficult. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 11:19:01
you must of done it! You have to download it when signing up through the web. If you had signed up through the mobile wallet you can skip that step. It would then show an option to download the backup pdf in the settings. 
@_date: 2016-01-07 23:51:24
haha, great.
@_date: 2016-01-18 22:44:43
nice one ! ha!
@_date: 2016-01-07 11:30:02
But Netflix doesn't do single payments for 1 show. I'm sure they will not change their business models to accommodate bitcoin use. 
@_date: 2016-01-07 12:33:57
Awesome service! 
@_date: 2016-01-07 11:39:22
Nah, we don't.
@_date: 2016-01-07 11:38:21
You're saying a company like Netflix that has upwards of 5 billion dollars in revenue every year would immediately change their successful business model to accommodate bitcoin, which I might add is being used less and less for payments. Take a look at Bitpay, they are pivoting from bitcoin as a payment system. I think you're also underestimating the difficulty of getting two companies to work together. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 13:54:50
Looks very interesting, good job!
@_date: 2017-03-28 11:21:12
Incorrect. If BTC.com had 100 upon 100's of tiny inputs, then BTC.com would be paying a very high fee, not the receiver of the bitcoin...!

@_date: 2017-03-27 06:55:03
BTC.com DOES give you a backup seed PDF, you are prompted to download it or email it when you sign up. If you didn't do that you can go into settings and find it there.

Hey, at least their nice enough to give us a number to call to ASK if we can buy Bitcoin with our OWN MONEY. 
@_date: 2016-09-09 08:30:07
yeah i second his question, why would you?
@_date: 2016-09-09 09:24:26
nothing will happen without ECB having a concrete stance about Bitcoin, nothing to see here.

it's just someone at the innovation center. They experiment with blockchain and stuff every quarter... they then show the experiment to the board of directors, which is almost 100% certainly "not approved". They do this every quarter. Everyone makes money though :)

lmao :')
@_date: 2016-09-27 10:07:03
I suppose if they really wanted to they could track when a miner enters the country. I don't think they would though, as that seems like a costly thing to do.

We at BTC.com are helping with giving away bitcoin to students as part of the Bitcoin Airdrop initiative organized by Blockchain Education Network more info can be found here: 
We believe teaching people how bitcoin works and giving them some small of bitcoin is the best way to attract new users.

Nothing will happen until the Europen Central Bank has a concrete stance on Bitcoin, 'till then it's just the innovation centers toying around with "Blockchain Technology'.

You're right, hard to enforce.

good job :]

Actually considering this. If we held one here in Europe, would you (and others) attend and what topics would you like for us to cover?
@_date: 2018-07-25 09:51:38
Fees, correct
@_date: 2015-04-24 09:41:36
great point, what I'm talking about is the fintech industry where the blockchain seems to be getting more traction over bitcoin. In this case, the price is irrelevant (for them).
@_date: 2015-09-04 10:45:12
Use blocktrails block explorer instead: 
@_date: 2015-09-04 11:13:23

Try [Blocktrail]( proven security for years already, easy to use and a nice UI.

Shouldn't be too surprising; the country's currency controls and declining economic freedoms are causing Venezuelans to desperately find other avenues to conduct business in. I believe Venezuela is a very interesting use case for Bitcoin as a currency.

I've noticed that many of the people in the group are not very technical, if at all. Facebook is a natural avenue for information for the less technically inclined. Sort of sucks, yes, but at the same time  it's great that they have a source of information readily available. 
@_date: 2015-10-01 14:11:12
The Venezuelan and Argentinian bitcoin facebook groups are very active. I've been monitoring them for a while now (little over a year) and have seen a lot of interest in all things bitcoin along with a continuous influx of new users.

With SendChat you can send Bitcoin, earn in Bitcoin, purchase and sell Bitcoin with fiat currencies (30 fiat currencies supported) and use Bitcoin in the SendChat store to purchase good and services from your favorite stores.
Yes, we will also integrate other alternative coins, users however will not need to bother with them and only use Bitcoin, if they so wish!
Highly related to this forum, as our mission is to bring Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general to the mainstream.
Thank you

Adding this feature doesn't make it any worse off for our users, since they are still transacting with a financial intermediary and revealing the same information either way. If they don't want this, they'd use localbitcoins.
People already use our wallet to receive their salary, to make payments, or simply for savings. As a service provider we can only extend our offering - giving people more options to purchase bitcoins - but it's entirely up to them if they wish to use it.
