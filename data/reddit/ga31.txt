If you withdrew to another mtgox account address, it gets transferred internally and doesn't appear in the blockchain.

Over a month, no withdrawals (CAD)
If you have any holdings in mtgox i would advise you to cancel any withdrawals and get you bitcoins out of gox.

You have to base your pitch on your audience. There are so many facets of bitcoin, and the unique benefits that may appeal to one person may not appeal to all.
If I'm speaking with someone that I know is libertarian leaning, then I will focus on the fact that it is genuinely sound money whose supply cannot be manipulated. It's also pseudonymous, and payments cannot be stopped by the government.
If I'm speaking with someone that is interested in practical benefits, then I focus on the lower fees and potential for international money transfers. The lower fees can have a real impact on low-margin businesses that end up paying a larger percentage of their margin to the credit card companies.
If I'm speaking to someone technically minded, then I talk about how interesting it is from a technological standpoint.
**Libertarian**: Bitcoin is new money that's open-source, decentralized, and potentially anonymous and can't be controlled by the government.
**Money-Minded**: Bitcoin is new Internet-created money which fosters lower fees for international money transfers, merchants, and it's an investment opportunity.
**Technically-Minded**: Bitcoin in new money created online that's open-source and cryptographically impossible to hack and it's potential is yet untapped.
