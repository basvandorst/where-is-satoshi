It’s kind of like a metaphor for life

Exchange Crashing is like built in internet protection from the effects of too many panic sells fueling price crashes.

Buy the dip!

If it crashes we will be right back up in the long term. Bitcoin isn’t going anywhere.

You made a long term investment. Forget about it for awhile. That’s what I did after my first dip and when I clued back in again my investment had doubled. Zoom out.

What a relief!

I love how people say money moving into bitcoin is motivated by greed and FOMO. WTF exactly motivates Wall Street? Love and gratitude? Give me a break.

I think it seems to be developing into digital gold though. Savings basically. I think a different crypto currency will end up being used for smaller transactions and bitcoin will only be spent to buy cars and houses and things. 
I even saw an ad for a house today being sold for bitcoin :)

I don’t blame people for enjoying life, but it could end badly.

One must admit humanity going out by transforming its entire energy supply into database entries would be pretty funny to alien anthropologists.

When climate change amps up the entire stock market will crash, capitalism will implode, and none of this will matter anyway. Might as well enjoy the ride.

So glad I didn’t keep waiting for a dip back at 8k and finally bought in.
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:19:21
Haha no when it was 8k like four days ago or whatever. Didn’t get in on today’s dip, cuz crashing

How soon?
