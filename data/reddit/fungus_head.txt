Yes. The hashing algorythm could be changed toa more secure one.

Dont get emotional, guys. 
The big fish are buying right now. Just hodl. 
Here is the worlds richest address as an example:

Its about links and a handful of "pictures in form of text"
The blockhchain does not store jpegs. Its FUD.

Private newcomers only amount to a tiny fraction of price action in BTC nowadays. They are not that significant in this more or less developed market anymore. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 20:50:37
There is much new money on the sidelines to pour into BTC and alts. The whole infrastructure has improved immensely in the past months. Lightning Network, consumer-friendly and low-fee exchanges like Robinhood, payment services, increasing adoption.. when the next FOMO starts, it will be faster and broader than the last one. During the last bull run and the crash in January/February so many new people learned about BTC and are displeased that they missed the opportunity. If there is a spark on the horizon for a new one, many will take it.
@_date: 2018-03-17 00:38:42
I dont think you can compare the sentiment of non-tech people and mainstream media with BTC value. 
It is something so strange to most of the population that they dont even understand its principle, much less its implications on other things. The mainstream media will always write something dumb about BTC no matter its price. 
The reason for the lack of much news at the moment is simply that BTC has been trading in a relatively calm way for some weeks. No normal media is really interested in it when it does not gain/lose 50% or more in short time. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:21:21
Buy now. Nobody knows ir it will go down a bit further or not, but after many bullish news (USA and EU with no-harm-policy towards cryptomarket, good response and no lost Coins with Binance attack, Lightning Network, increasing adoption in the last months..) it is likely that BTC and alts will enter into a new long bull cycle soon. Just like they did 10 times before after such crashes. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 00:45:30
After such a harsh drop, BTC is certain to rebound. Maybe it wont be the total bottom yet, but a bounce of at least 3-5% is very likely quite now. Wait a bit if you want to get out.
@_date: 2018-03-20 19:38:10
No clue if this indicates anything at all but if it does it probably indicates that lambos might be sold out soon.
@_date: 2018-03-15 14:25:22
I would say generally positive ones. 
Both US and EU governments have already stated a no-harm-approach. The IMF also showed a very positive stance recently. 
Governments are not dumb. They will want to take part in the possibilities or crypto. 
The only countries with a  clearly negative stance on crypto are china and some third-world nations like jamaica and a bunch of muslim dominated countries.

For the intermediate future, it is resolved. Witz SegWit adoption rising and Lightning just starting on mainnet, the network capability has risen drastically. It may not be ready for a usage level of total mainstream adoption yet, but that wont come for several years at least. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:10:10
Average transaction value: 11,8 BTC
Median transaction value: 0.076 BTC
Only a very small fraction of transactions provides the bulk of volume. Newcomere are unlikely to handle with multiple BTCs. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 22:37:35
America, Europe and the developed nations in Asia outside of China welcome blockchain innovation as well as the use of cryptocurrencies. Regulatory framework aims to align laws concerning cryptocurrency internationally. Fiscal authorities develop methods to overwatch ICOs and effectively act on emerging scams.
@_date: 2018-03-18 18:48:57
Just look at bitinfocharts. 
There really are not that many people with a significant amount in crypto right now. Of course in such a market whales have ultimate power. 
It will stabilize with in increasing adoption and a larger number of participants. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 16:51:23
The last BTC-Crash was in september. While all the "Is BTC now dead"-headlines were propping up for weeks, the price secretly crawled onto the last ATH of around 5000 dollars.. and then shot 4x above it in a bull run for several months. 
Back then we had no Lightning Network, no positive stance on crypto from US and EU governements, no praising for Crypto from the head of the IMF, no anti-scam-actions, no Robindhood, no Abra, no SegWit-adoption, no Goldman Sachs involved in Crypto and we had noone do anything about a bazillion shady ICO scams. 
All we had was a fucking Jamie Dimon buying up the dip he himself helped to create. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 14:37:14
It felt thrilling everytime you watched the price. Like driving really fast. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:26:46
Yeah i know that its some exchange, that doesnt matter. 
It matters that it is owned by people who can pay other people to analyse the market as good as anyone can and that they have enough money to not be dependent on their BTC for some time. Therefore the trading decisions they make are
1. likely as rational as one can act in crypto market
2. a significant bullish factor because of the immense amount they buy up continuously  
3. a strong bullish signal for others

No. 
Nostradamus says: "After the deceivers betrayed the rightful king in a terrible night, the moon rose brigther and higher than ever before to honour the holy rule of the godly chosen"
Clear indication of mooining today late evening. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 21:03:17
You are a dumbass.
Even now we are still a bit a b o v e the trendline needed for his prediction to come true and there is no reason that BTC wont rebound strongly after this downward trend, like it has done dozens of times before.
@_date: 2018-03-17 21:44:56
Nobody knows if its a good idea or not. BTC could start a trend reversal in the next minute, even if thats not that likely. 
Mabye it wont even move much from now until we hear something from the G20 meeting.

How high will the ATH of this supposed next bull run be? Taking into account the last ATH after crashes, i would suggest &gt;50,000.
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:43:42
Maybe we hardcore enthusiasts dont, but the people with money in their pocket do. They will move the price. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 20:19:22
They most likely have enough profit secured that they wont ever have to need to sell that low. With panic emotions mostly out of the way, they can base their moves more on logic than most of us do. And it is logical to assume that BTC will rise again and multiply their possible gainings compared to now. The risk of losing their investment is there, but it is comparatively low.
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:04:48
Nobody knows when a dip comes and nobody knows when it will go up, you are talking shit. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:03:06
There is no news yet. 
The outlook seems positive, though. 
No large countries in Europe and America have an openly negative stance on cryptos, most are clearly positive towards them. The IMF even praised crypto as a means to empower people in third world countries a few days ago.
Institutional investors will step in when they see legislative security being established in the coming months, which the meeting could signal.
@_date: 2018-03-17 22:31:39

That supposes he would know what to do to push it up. 
Dont think he does. He'd probably write some shitty, over the top and conflicting tweets every other day that scare investors away. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:05:12
TA for a completely new market which is highly dependent on external factors is voodoo. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:37:02
The bottom is likely near. Selling now has a high risk of of not beeing able to buy back without loss.
@_date: 2018-03-18 13:30:05
I dont think that says too much. 
Who is googling "Bitcoin" all day? Newcomers with at most a few 1000s to invest are. 
Institutional buyers or expoerienced investors whou have a lot of profit to invest again dont. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 02:11:48
Just look what LTC just did. 
Bitcoin will follow soon. Cryptomarket is in recovery mode.

The worlds richest BTC-address is buying and growing larger and larger during times like these. 
So are many other rich BTC-adresses. None of the 20 richest ones are selling large amount in the past days. 
Keep hodling.

Demand and supply are different depending on region as is the the popularity of exchanges in different regions.

"hold on dear life" came later. 
At first it simply was a misspelling by some drunk guy on a forum. Others liked to joke with it. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:18:33
With all the improvements in infrastructure in the past months and the likely moderately positive to clearly positive output of the G20 tomorrow, i dont see that. A bounce and trend reversal could happen very soon. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 02:16:13
The short answer is: The most hashing power wins.
@_date: 2018-03-17 21:38:06
You're right. Wasn't meant to be rude.
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:26:04
Half the people who invested in Dezember 2017 and burned themselves will want to try to redeem their loss and invest a portion of their original investment again. 
All the other people who watched the surge and were too late will see it as another chance. New user friendly platforms like Robinhood, that new mobile app in India and others play right into this.
A look at the numbers of adresses and the amounts in them tell you, that no more than half a million adresses with more than one bitcoin in them exist. Considering that many people have several adresses and a big portion of the wealthy ones belong to firms, probably only about 100.000 people worldwide own an amount of 1 Bitcoin or more. So plenty of room for newcomers with too much money on their bank account. 
Institutional investors are more likely to spend money on BTC now than they were last year because of the positive signs in the US senate-hearing, the beginning mass adoption we see right now (litepay, litepal, bitpay, coinbaseXpaypal etc.). At the moment fees are low and transactions are fast and both will likely stay that way because of the imminent adoption of segwit (coinbase is enabling it this month ) and lightning (first desktop-application is out, the first 600 nodes on the mainnet are running at this moment)
Lastly.. the stocks market right now. If only 10% of people who are selling in fear of a market crash are willing to put 10% of the money they just sold into the cryptomarket the impact would be enormous.
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:12:31
Today - tomorrow ist the last chance to do so. 
With the positive news out of the G20 meeting many new investors will take their bet and jump in. Will most likely, albeit slowly, start a new bull run. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:51:45
Every other cryptocurrency explodes at some time. And does it again and again after a crash and some consolidation. Bitcoin does not behave any other than it did since its creation and dozens of other currencies do exactly the same. Its normal in this extremely volatile market.

There is no problem of getting money onto exchances via standard bank transfers. May be not that comfortable than cradit card, but who cares? Outside of the US this process is often more common than credit card anyways.
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:54:25
German here. 
Thats great. It actually stays as true to the original as possible, with "they will drown in their own gains" being derived from the original "they will drown in their own blood" etc.

This thing is going on for months. US is investigating the claims for some time now and so far we have heard nothing to come out of that. 
At the moment its just a claim, based on connections between the CEO of Bittinex and the people behind Tether.
Tether has a market cap of only 2.22 Billion. BTC right now is at 142 Billion. Last week there was news of some study that showed little influence of Tether on the BTC-price, i dont hav the link anymore but try to just google it if you are interested in it. 
Even if it really is a scam Bitfinex probably could just have brought up the money at the time someone was looking into it. Just selling a small portion of their BTC-holdings would have been enough to get onto the whole amount of 2.22 Billion Dollar that Tether claims to hold in reserve.
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:37:48
You may wait a bit
The Feb low around 6K may very well give us a double bottom here
