No, the IRS has no need to come knocking. All they have to do is look at Coinbase's records to see the address where you sent it. It's a public blockchain. If the coins are still at the same address, you haven't sold them.

What happens if you own rare art that also happens to be an investment, and it gets stolen? It depends. Was it covered by insurance?

No, coinbase doesn't count it as a sell. They just list it as such because once it's gone from coinbase they don't know what has happened to it.
It's your responsibility as a taxpayer to document that the coins are now held in a wallet outside of coinbase.

Maybe one of these days bitcoiners are going to realize Max's shtick is being an entertainer and promoting himself. Same goes for Schiff.
All you noobs fall for it. It's as real as pro wrestling.
Take a look into the shitcoins he created years ago and went to 0. All about how he can make money.

Dude... max and peter have been buddies for years. schiff has been on his show lots of times, both talking about the benefits of gold. you're being conned by a bunch of entertainers and you don't realize it.

I've talked with my accountant about this, and he said it's no different than a company that does business in multiple currencies. It's necessary to keep track of each one, and always use exchange rates to convert back to USD so you know the tax burden.
So even if you're exchanging SHITCOIN to 3 BTCHCOIN, you have to find out the price of BTC in USD when each of those transactions are made (there are sites that list this historical data down to the minute), determine how much was gained or lost in USD, and that's what is included for taxes.

Compuserve and AOL provided excellent centralized email services in the early and mid 90s that introduced people to the concept of email way before hotmail ever became popular.

I think you need to have a discussion with your wife and explain to her there are lots of crypto scams on twitter, and no one is going to believe this without clearly identifiable proof.

And that's what caused email to become commonplace in the 90s. Compuserve, AOL and others provided centralized services that took away the technical complexities.

One of these days the current crypto enthusiasts will realize 95% of society could care less about such things. As long as people have the illusion of security, ownership, etc. it will be good enough for them.

The vast majority of people care about UX and don't care about decentralization.

Not to be conspiracy-minded, but could be that they need to earn back funds for margin loans that have been stuck for almost 10 days: 
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:59:56
Same for me, still dealing with this issue. Have five open 2-day loans. Three are from 08:39 UTC on 2017-07-19, and two are from 13:21 UTC on 2017-07-21.
Have posted multiple messages to a support ticket, but no response. Would greatly appreciate a response from on this.

I agree, but everyone raved about how successful Bitfinex was for socializing losses from last year's hack, and how it would be a model for exchanges in the future. Who knows.
