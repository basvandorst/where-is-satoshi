I don't know use it to take some of the bigger mining pools offline and do a +50% attack to get the Satoshi million bitcoin stash?

I think his argument all along has been that bitcoin is a currency and not an asset. 
IF he is SN and he's got 1/2-1 billion dollars worth of BTC and he wants to exchange that for fiat, then it's a big fucking deal tax wise. 
If it's treated as a currency transfer, then there is no tax. If it's treated as him selling something for a capital gain then it's a fucking HUGE tax bill. Well worth skipping the country for.

Maybe he's simulating bitcoin in an attempt to steal bitcoins? Maybe his super computer is stress testing the network in order to take it over and for him to profit? Just a thought.

Well I'm just guessing at a 50% attack but there * could * be a way and I think a super computer might be a good tool to start with.

He also owns the biggest privately held supercomputer. He might be using it to steal bitcoins but if so, he's trying to hide in plain sight.

I agree with most stuff in this thread, but just because he used a hashtag in his email doesn't make him unprofessional. I've done much larger deals than this through emails that consisted entirely of things like "Yep." "Fuck it do it" and the like. Deals worth thousands celebrated with shots at a strip club. The list goes on and gets messy, but it happens every day. 
You don't know the context of any previous emails and the OP seems quite content to use twitter as a bargaining chip in this. 
I'm not defending the guy, he's straight up broken a contract.

I've spent more than an hour downloading a jpg from a BBS so do not make fun of 90's tech. 
And yes it was the baseball bat in the pussy jpg.

I really don't see the advertising value in this. 
Google is still going to dominate all internet advertising as well as browser share. 
Creating an un-adblocked browser that gives you warm fuzzies and pocket change is idealistic but it's not going to work. 
There is so much money that doesn't want it to work. And that's the end of the story.
