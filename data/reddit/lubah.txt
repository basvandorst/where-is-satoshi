join the club - it sucks, I know - my attempts to convey the dastardly deed fell on deaf ears -   ended up just creating a new account and starting over as a jr member despite once having sr member status...

RaspPi3 and a 256gb USB 3.0 stick is all you need...  $200 tops - the stick should be good for a couple years growth in Blockchain size -

Metals are sadly easily manipulated by the crimex folks...  naked paper shorts, settle in cash, etc..  Bitcoin cannot be manipulated as easily as silver (hunt bros) nor gold with all of the paper derivatives...    I lost all faith in gold the day of Michael Jackson funeral -  check out the 'MJ' initials they carved into the daily chart.... just pathetic.

that's because no one uses or still hodls that shitcoin - if you haven't converted to BTC or BSV at a minimum by now you deserve to lose out....

they have a matching 1 btc deal - which worked but somehow after I withdrew my original btc  they magically started stealing my remaining balance -- $60 in one shot, too...   subsequent complaints to customer support did rectify the situation, though.   proceed with caution and watch your balance.
