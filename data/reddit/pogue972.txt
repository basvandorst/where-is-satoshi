What's Zap? They don't have a link to a website or any other info on their Twitter page.

You don't seem to realize how bad this looks politically to the populace at large who don't understand cryptocurrency and how it works. All they might know is BTC is used to buy drugs &amp; kiddie porn on the darknet, and then when (and if) the MSM picks up on this they'll have a field day decrying it as a currency used by rogue states to fund atomic weapon programs.

If this starts getting more traction in the press, it's only going to make the currency and it's users look worse.

Technically, nothing. But, if they started to crack down hard on BTC money exchangers or other services that are trying to play 'nice' with US regulators (e.g.: Coinbase is an especially is a good example), it would just make it much, much harder for people to use the currency than it already is. 
I think the only thing that can be done about it is PR control from pro-BTC publications to denounce NK for doing this, not advocate that it's a good and great advancement for Bitcoin.

No, but it's just very negative press for the currency, and in light of the fact that our POTUS is on a war like footing with the country, it might cause them to want to try &amp; look into more than they already do. That would simply be bad for BTC as it's built on principles to keep the govt from trying to regulate (or ban) the currency.
