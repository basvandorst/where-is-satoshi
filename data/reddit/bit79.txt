I think there's also an iteration factor when hashing passwords (  to prevent hackers from un-hashing each password individually.
But yes, it is strange.
@_date: 2016-08-08 05:04:38
Could it be the case that forced password reset would enable Bitfinex finding out what accounts are 'dead' and empty them?
@_date: 2016-08-16 09:53:48
A few months ago I received an email from Skype that someone else had accessed an old Skype account I had not used for a very, very long time. And the password for it was secure. So I reset my password quickly, contacted support and told me they would send this sort of messages to very old account owners. Nobody had found my password...
@_date: 2016-08-08 04:49:57
I don't know what to think of it, I cannot imagine what European authorities Bitfinex would be working with. There's no FBI equivalent in Europe. I call bullshit.

As long as you have not sold your Bitcoin, you still have only 1 BTC. Same if the price of BTC goes to 50 USD - you still have 1 BTC, you did not really lose anything.
Most likely you do not have to pay taxes if you are not a professional and the amount remains low.
@_date: 2016-08-08 05:01:48
I think it might be the case US customers will get back all their coins, because bitfinex won't spook US authorities so easily.

Why? I'd say Bitfinex makes Madoff look like old methods.
@_date: 2016-08-08 14:34:21
With 900 staff - how many could they put on the Bitfinex investigation, if they wanted to?
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:21:08
If it were a bank, at least, it would have called the customer to confirm the transaction :(
@_date: 2016-08-12 20:22:32
I apologize, but are you using a hardware wallet because you do not like Coinbase anymore, or because you could not keep your password secure?

If you contact exchanges and they recognize their deposit adresses, they may cooperate with you. (like: suspend transactions, provide information or return funds if requested by legal authorities). There was an online casino who got help from BTC-E this way.

Correct. That must be profitable. I am reporting it on "bing ads" as well.
@_date: 2016-04-01 19:07:46
Keep calm. I think you did not say why/if Kraken has told you why they have suspended your account.
If they told you they will try to reach to a conclusion by Monday, I think it means on Monday they will tell you if your account is released (i.e. if you can continue using it) or if your account is closed, and how your Bitcoins will be returned to you. (or maybe they will tell you if they need anything else from you)
In my experience, Kraken is one of the best managed exchanges of the world today - if not the best. I am sure suspending a 38 KEUR account is not something they take lightly, but it must happen sometimes. You have seen Jesse Powell commenting here. You have their attention (and the reddit bitcoin community).
If I were you, I would make sure I am acting professionally as well. Time to seek advice for your business, probably not to lawyer up or to build a brick wall or anything else stupid (there's a lot of noise on this thread). Ask a friend who's a lawyer. Or an accountant. Get in touch with your national Bitcoin association. Get references. If you have done nothing illegal - why not ask/file a statement with the police? Also consider in-person meeting. (I suppose you can ask support)
Again - if you have done nothing wrong, I am confident your issue will be solved on Monday. Being very stressed in the meantime is not going to be useful. Try relaxing and enjoying a good week-end. It could be worse - your Bitcoins could be with Mt. Gox or Criptsy or an endless list of others. And when you get your Bitcoins back, you will probably want to make sure your business never gets caught in such a situation again. I am sure it will be early next week.
Keep us posted.
@_date: 2016-04-01 10:24:29
Well does it make "strong/confirmed connection to other flagged/locked accounts" count?
I hope for you will get your money back. If you have done nothing wrong, I suppose it will not take very long.
But several people have already complained here, and after some time, it appeared they were lying.
(like the guy who robbed a casino and got his bitcoins taken away from him by BTC-E)
Plus when the exchange starts speaking out there is always someone to complain about user privacy.
@_date: 2016-04-10 07:43:15
Why don't you work like everybody else? Like buying, mining, offering services for Bitcoins...

I am not convinced it has been the case before (and certainly not for decades). It is hard for me to imagine a couple of paedophiles building apps and communities in their basement as well as WhatsApp and Facebook.
And it has not prevented acts of terrorism from happening recently. But in the future, it won't be possible to investigate connections between terrorists event after the event.
So I just fear the world will be less safe for all of us.

That's actually very reassuring for the people who are not involved with any of the causes you listed. Many of us have bitcoins/money on your platform, and we prefer to know you are doing what it takes to keep it running smoothly.

I got my bitcoins back a few days after they closed. That was a long time ago... Someone else re-opened and closed again after, I think.
@_date: 2015-06-06 17:21:22
Not sure... I think it becomes a fault if Bitstamp knowingly or negligently allows that... I am sure they have verification processes against that. I think it's more a case of bank 1 makes a mistake and pays grandpa backs, complains to bank 2, and bank 2 decides Bitstamp is too high maintenance customer and asks them to please find another bank? If ops post is true of course.
@_date: 2015-06-06 17:36:52
Sometimes its just the grandpas bank not checking who exactly sent this email asking to transfer some money to an exchanges bank account, or not checking the handwritten signature properly. The bank will cover the loss (most likely), police will ask the exchange for details about the transaction and at some point the exchanges bank itself will become annoyed with all the nasty messages they receive from other banks about their customer and terminate the relationship.
@_date: 2015-06-06 17:28:25
Are you sure? I sent them money at the end of the week and it worked normally. Maybe it's your bank account that's flagged for money laundering :)

Most exchanges are probably already making plans to apply for this license anyway. It is only a matter of time before similar legislations appear around the world and then, it will be very hard for the exchanges who don't comply yet to put themselves in conformity. They probably think it is better to start early. (I would think so)

@_date: 2014-09-14 18:35:11
The way I see it, when you send your fiat money to Coinbase, anyway they will get your name and your address. Using Tor on top of it is not going to change this fact and to increase your privacy. Yes the majority of Tor users are not using Tor for illegitimate purposes - privacy for example. But there also is a small number of people who use it for deceitful purposes - and I bet a disproportionate amount of them on Coinbase.

Find a small exchange near you. Every country has some. Contact support. Ask them for a number. Call, get reassured you are talking to a real person and start trusting them. If only a bit. Money is a question of trust anyway.

@_date: 2014-08-21 18:54:20
Very nice. I suppose your wallet is not fully synchronized yet. But the fact you got a private key for each of these change address means your wallet "has access" to these and you will be fine.
Do not share these private keys with anybody.
@_date: 2014-08-21 19:17:04
Do not worry. Worse case scenario - all you need is to import these private keys in another wallet, and your bitcoins will show up. Been there, done that, it worked.

I don't know any decentralized exchange and I don't see how a decentralized exchange could accept cash in a decentralized way. (unless you invent the decentralized bank account lol) In the end the money always goes to an real-world entity (a person or a company) that can be 'regulated'.
We all use the same small set of exchanges here.

@_date: 2014-03-05 16:19:04
But it is not that simple. When you start transacting you will see your balance properly updated on every computer... At the beginning. After some time, they will start diverging. Eventually, if you do many transactions, you delete your wallet from every computers, and you restore the original copy of your wallet... You will have lost all your Bitcoins. Behind the scenes, your wallet contains hidden addresses your Bitcoins are shuffled to over time. New wallets contain 100 hidden addresses. When all addresses have been used new addresses are created. Initial addresses are same across all copies of your original wallet. But new addresses will be different in every wallet and that's how you will lose all your coins.

Great remark. It is relatively easy to get a bank to transfer someone else's money to another bank account without his knowledge or approval (with a fake signature for example). Lookup "SEPA fraud" in a search engine. Then the money arrives to Coinbase, they send you the Bitcoins, and when the bank (or the police) calls Coinbase, they have no information about the scammer. It will go smooth a few times, after all it is not Coinbase's fault, and then they will be considered party to the scam if it happens too often, and they could be prosecuted. Or maybe it will stop before, when no bank want their business anymore.

True but that scales less well. Besides, what interests the fraudster, in dealing with Bitcoin, is to distantiate him/herself from the act, not to involve himself through his own bank account.
@_date: 2014-07-03 18:38:15
In my opinion you should not need an ID to cash Bitcoins out since the risk for the exchange is almost nil. (it is not like you can easily provide them with a fake bank account number isn't it?)
@_date: 2014-09-04 16:55:36
I don't think this is what they did. I'm quite sure they purchased at more or less the same rate they sold you and they thought there was a VAT on what they had purchased as well.

Yes except if the costs of running the exchange actually outweight the benefits. If you process 1,500,000 USD a day (in/out) and people actually store 3,000,000 USD with you... You don't really need to keep that money you can just spend it. Until they all want it back, that is.

I don't think you are right if you mean stores can sell products for BTC cheaper than for NOK because BTC would be VAT-exempt. Buying and selling bitcoin is VAT-exempt, but if you sell goods or services for bitcoin without VAT, you are in for a very bad fiscal surprise at the end of the year.

- Fraudster gets name + bank account number of some victims (businesses, students, old people...)
- Fraudster prints SEPA transfer forms (on paper) and fakes signatures
- Fraudster drops forms at banks
- Some banks do not check the signatures and they send the money
- When the victims realize and complain, the banks will try to recall the transfer, but there is a 10-days limit (and Bitstamp/Bitstamp's bank may deny the recall anyway), and ultimately the banks may have to reimburse their customers, because [exchanges/businesses] are not responsible for the payments that reach their bank account (the one who makes the mistake is the bank that sends the payment, not the [exchange/business] or the victim)
- After a few times, the banks flag [exchange/business]'s bank account number for fraud
- Fraudster faxes/emails SEPA transfer forms (or other documents) to the banks

Or unless it was transferred fraudulently - in which case the bank will freeze your accounts until the situation is sorted out, and if you refuse to reimburse and it happens too often there may be legal trouble ahead for you - like being considered complicit of the fraud.

I cannot recommend much for creating a paper wallet. Issue with all these services is - what happens if they keep a copy of your private key and use it later.
I have never created a paper wallet (disclaimer) but I think I would use Bitcoin-Core. (create a new address, send bitcoins there, dump the private key, print it and delete the wallet)
@_date: 2017-08-06 17:52:00
In my opinion, Bitcoin is anonymous enough to conceal things nobody will never be looking for you for. But if you are using it to commit a crime someone will still be looking for you for in, say, 1, 5, 10 or 20 years - you will be caught.
Who can say here Bitcoin wasnt invented by the NSA to catch all criminals at once :)

I am not sure I get your question. You can just transfer your coins from Bitcoin-Core back to (another) paper wallet. (you should not want reusing the original paper wallet)
And then, if you like, you can create another paper wallet, and transfer your BCC there.
@_date: 2016-12-26 06:08:19
Absolutely fine for small amounts

In my personal opinion, it is not a problem. If the police strongly suspects a specific criminal activity and the terms of service allow sharing of some information, then I don't see why it should not be done.
Those exchanges are committed to protecting our privacy, not the secrecy of a couple of criminals.
Unless, of course, you prefer trading your bitcoins on an exchange that may go down tomorrow... With your money.

A complaint against former MP Laurent Louis was filed Friday afternoon in the hands of an investigating judge in Brussels, lawyers André-Philipe Vandesmal, Olivier Dupont and Guibert Debray announced. The complainant claims to be the victim of a pyramid scheme of the Ponzi type, of which Laurent Louis is the active representative in Belgium. The prejudices concern facts of fraud, pyramid selling, violation of the banking law, money laundering and social fraud. Since the spring of 2016, Mr. Louis offers financial products as well as training in network marketing via One-Life.
This company is promoting a virtual currency called One-Coin. It boasts nearly 2 million users worldwide. According to the complainant, the former president of the Debout Les Belges movement is the biggest promoter of the network in Belgium. He recruited between 2,000 and 3,000 people in Belgium thanks to his personal network. This would represent a turnover of more than 2 million euros, with a profit between 100,000 and 200,000 euros in 8 months.
It should be noted that the FSMA had already warned citizens in July 2016 about the practices of the former MP. The agency said in a statement that "the allegations that Mr. Laurent Louis made public on his Facebook page, according to which the FSMA would have indicated that it could not find fault with the OneCoin" and that "for the FSMA, The OneCoin does not pose any problem and is not illegal nor a scam" are therefore false and misleading. The FSMA then insisted on the precautionary measures to be taken with regard to this type of virtual currency.
The plaintiff's lawyers expressed doubts about the legality of One-Coin's financial products. They explain that many banks around the world have closed accounts related to the company following presumptions of Ponzi type scam. The complainant received a warning from the investigating judge to stop all activities related to virtual money as well as network marketing.

[Travel documents for no-EU nationals]( *Border officials in EU countries may ask for other supporting documents such as an invitation letter, proof of lodging, return or round-trip ticket*.
In Belgium at least, an invitation letter is an "engagement de prise en charge" or "commitment to support" which is an official document, not an informal document. I have invited people and had to provide proofs of income.
Without an invitation, if you get stopped and controlled at the border, then you may have to prove you have [95 euros/day of your stay]( otherwise you may be denied entry.

I think you do as follows.
Long enough after 8/1:
Step 1: You import your paper wallet in Bitcoin-Core. It shows X BTC. You transfer your coins to another address.
Step 2: You import your paper wallet in Bitcoin ABC (for example) on ANOTHER computer. It shows X BCC. You transfer your coins to another address.
The important parts are "Step 1" and "another computer". Because I do not trust Bitcoin ABC not to be a scam and to try to steal as many bitcoins as possible from Bitcoin Core installations or addresses.
@_date: 2017-07-29 08:16:36
@_date: 2017-07-29 14:49:42
If BTC-E had proper records and balances, I think you will be able to get them back... in some time. I would seek advice from a lawyer (you must be able to get some for free) and file a complaint with the police (filing a complaint with the police might also be useful later in the process of getting back your coins). But you may be in for a lot of paperwork and costs.
@_date: 2017-07-29 14:55:02
I understand about the costs part. I don't understand what could have sent you to jail?
How much was the amount, out of curiosity? A few hundred dollars at the time?
@_date: 2017-07-29 22:14:26
Step 1 being moving all your coins to a new address (address 1)? If you are already on Bitcoin Core but your coins are in 200 different addresses, it may be tedious to import all of them in Bitcoin ABC. (of course, you may just copy your entire wallet.dat file into Bitcoin ABC)
Also, I think you should not use these addresses in the future anymore, because what if Bitcoin ABC is a scam to steal your real bitcoins? (or if you make some mistake)
@_date: 2017-07-29 08:21:35
I think you should move all your coins to a new address (address 1) long enough before Aug. 1, and turn off Bitcoin Core.
On Aug. 2 or something, restart Bitcoin Core, and move your coins to yet another address (address 2).
Then, on another computer, start Bitcoin ABC (for example) and import the private key from address 1. Move your coins to another address (address 3).
Now, you have X BTC and X BCC.
Key thing - I think - is to move your BTC out of address 1 before importing the private key in Bitcoin ABC and to do it on another computer just in case Bitcoin ABC is a scam trying to steal all our BTC's.
@_date: 2016-07-11 11:20:51

Yes, but let's not confuse the SLA of a deposit/withdrawal or a SEPA transfers. For example, if I promise to send you a SEPA transfer... soon, the bank has 1 business day to complete it once I have submitted it, but it does not mean I cannot submit it on Friday. Same with receiving it. The bank has to complete it within 1 business day but I can acknowledge it later (accordingly with my T&amp;C's right?)

In my experience as a witness, that's a great way to lose your coins :)

That's one of the things used to buy bitcoins and to estimate their worth?

Thank you for your reply.
I don't have a strong opinion on UASF, BIP148, Segwit, Segwit2x... I think some of the loudest people with the strongest opinion actually know less about it than I do.
My current reference is Bitcoin Core. And also, when I google bitcoin, I currently find Bitcoin-Core, so... That must be where bitcoin is and it is very reassuring :)
