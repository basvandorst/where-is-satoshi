Doesn't really matter it still cost me that much to make the transaction overall. 
Doesn't matter what end its on I am losing that in fees.

People are going to lose a lot of money soon

Same with hitbtc tx fees are still $15 each... Costs $30+ to move btc from HitBTC to local btc
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:02:33
But it is a total fee to transfer its half and half.
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:41:57
I just paid $25 fee still fucking waiting 18 hours later - pending
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:12:02
It was a withdrawal from HitBTC price is 0.0007 and local bitcoins takes that again just for depositing there :/

Locallitecoins is shit though I want to sell my coins by national bank transfer not wait for some scummy exchange to credit my account 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:39:12
Well I am still waiting for my transaction to go through now more than 24 hours later

Literally the equivalent of that happening now is every exchange going  down at once, then you panic

Would need total blockchain destruction
Like solar flare extinction event level.
So it probably wouldnt matter anyway we'd be dead

I think most people in crypto grew up on xbox live so the trolling just evolved
@_date: 2018-04-17 14:49:02
And they fake their volume regularly

Not redlining because most are under clocked / reduced volts. Probably costs more playing games 24/7.
