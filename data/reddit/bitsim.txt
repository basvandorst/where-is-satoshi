Depending on how the site goes for the next little while this can be something on the roadmap.

Basically so you can save your transaction history and log back in and continue where you left off. Our site works in real-time getting the latest Bitcoin value from different exchanges.

Our main focus is providing a tool to test out your strategies. Learning by doing is the approach we're trying to facilitate. If you have a strategy you want to try but also want to avoid the risk of investing real money while learning, that's how we can help. Someone serious about trading real Bitcoin can choose to take the time to find a strategy that works for them by testing with our site.

The entire site is using HTTPS for encryption.

Resolved. Thanks :)

We thought of that as one potential problem that we may have, especially for day traders. 
If you were to spend $100,000 on Bitstamp right now, you would only change the market's value by $7 which is very little compared to the actual trade fee of $36 ($720 x 0.5% = $36). Also, we don't believe the average person would be able to invest that much money into a real exchange so it would affect it even less.
We do agree with you that this does introduce inaccuracies, however, we felt it wasn't too big of a problem considering how little you would change the market. Unless you trade with extremely large amounts, it should still be fairly accurate.
If you do have an idea of how we can make the simulator even more accurate, we would love to know!

The registration email no longer contains the password. Thanks Chakra_Scientist.

We have considered this exploit and that's why we have a 5 minute delay for cashing out from either exchange. We chose 5 minutes because it's enough time to deter someone from sitting at their computer to do this exploit but not long enough to hinder them with practicing their strategy. Remember, these aren't real Bitcoins so using exploits that work on our simulator but not on the real exchanges does not provide much benefit.

The intial registration email was sent as part of the user registration process, which is where the plain-text password was obtained from but not stored. This has been removed as per the above comment. Passwords are hashed on our server. There is no way for us to view a password in plain-text. The password you enter when logging in is part of what's used to decrypt what's stored in our database. With the method of encryption we use, rainbow table attacks would take an infeasible amount of time. Your passwords are practically uncrackable.
