I think you nailed it, that makes sense. I'll give it a whirl tonight and hopefully be ordering me some coffee this evening. Cheers dude!

Is there anyway to run this on a pruned node?

And Bitcoin wasn't opposed to a block size increase, just not one forced before it's time.

Legacy tech? Because transactions are more costly in sat/byte and if you're not willing to pay the fee, confirmation times can be longer. 99% of every altcoins serves a singular purpose, used to earn more BTC.  Innovation happens in the open source community who contribute to the Bitcoin project.

For some reason it was failing with saving the conf file
`Error writing /home/bitcoin/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf: No such file or directory ]`
And it seems when I run `sudo install -m 0755 -o root -g root -t /usr/local/bin bitcoin-0.15.1/bin/*` it doesn't actually install which is why it can't find the `/.bitcoin` folder.
Anyone know what's up?
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:25:24
For the above reasons mentioned you obviously were to inept to comprehend from reading it.

The "other" sub. What a way to put it. is basically the anti bitcoin page, post after posts discussing how everyone loathes Bitcoin or anything to do with it, while upvoting Craig Wright, Pedo Falkvinge , Ayre and yes Ver too. Some of the worst actors in Crypto

Before this I used a hammer, metal, and these(  , and about the seed, this is from their site.
    Help! My Trezor Seed is 157 letter long, but Cryptosteel only has space for 96 characters. What do I do?
    The beauty of the BIP39 format and the Cryptosteel backup solution is that you only need to store and access the 
    first 4 letters of each word. These 4-letter sequences are unique and sufficient to recover the full sentence and 
    thus the entire bitcoin wallet. We have frequency analysis data backing up that 96 is the minimum number of 
    letters necessary and sufficient for optimal wallet recovery seed security.
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:16:38
I'll just leave this here - 
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:44:23
I've already dumped the private key from the P2PKH address I used to create it into cold storage using crypto steel, just was looking to confirm for a little piece of mind that that keys are the same before I start sending anything to the segwit address. Running pruned version of the core client, so import isn't an option on this system, something I can certainly see about replicating though on another system, thanks dude!

@_date: 2018-03-09 11:29:19
So you didn't move your coins to a new address before compromising your existing private key to claim a fork?
@_date: 2018-03-22 12:22:29
Not all merchants are looking to convert to fiat, beyond covering some operational costs.
@_date: 2018-02-21 09:21:12
GoCoin and shitty Bitpay are the only other options on Shopify currently as a merchant looking to accept BTC.
@_date: 2018-03-22 11:01:41
 too

Except to get your BTC, now you have to kyc yourself.

It links directly to the RC files, and there was no change from RC4 to the final:

Any issues with compiling this now?
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:04:18
You can run it pruned, have mine set to 2gb's
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:17:46
Because not a single other fork is claiming to be Bitcoin, they're their own Bitcoin Project, like UbuntuMate, you don't see Ubuntu variations claiming to be the one true Ubuntu.
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:50:32
Something I noticed, I did the same on an air gapped machine, and when testing and importing the private key, it generated not only my p2SH addy, but also a legacy address, and bech32, all sharing that private key.

I HODL because I hate the man.

Biggest hurdle to adoption with BTCPay and Lightning is merchants having to host their own node. Most folks running stores on say Shopify aren't technically capable of doing so

 and unixstickers.com both accept Bitcoin

Nothing from [bitcoin.com]( and bitpay is hot garbage. Run a pruned version of Core ([  if you don't want or have space/electrum ([ as well as  Wasabi ([
