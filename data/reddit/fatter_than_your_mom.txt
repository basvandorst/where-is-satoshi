My brother gave me a half eaten mars bar on my 15th birthday. Spent all his money in a fruit machine, borrowed 50p off his mate then got hungry on the way home. Fucking twat.

You not going to be able to mine, you would spend more on electricity then you would make back in bitcoin. The days of your average Joe being able by mine bitcoin ended a long time ago. If you want to invest in bitcoin then i would first recommend just reading up on the subject for a while and then just buy some rather than trying to mine.

When buying 5 kilos of coke in Amsterdam, it a lot quicker counting out the cash in 500's. Saves space too.

Checked it out (for science). 
Bored looking girls, didn't even see a single nipple. As a scientist I would have liked to see some pussy, for science of course, I am doing a PhD on the "downstairs" hair styles of adult models over the years, from the 1950s to modern day. If you yourself are a female glamour model and would like to take part in this research, please feel free to contact me.
