Bearer of bad news...there was another hack...
@_date: 2018-01-27 05:13:40
I wonder how the Coincheck hack is going to affect this? They are going to have to pump significantly more money in after this hack...
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:04:59
If you have more money to put in...
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:34:25
I have hyperfocus ADD, so I cant stop staring....
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:22:47
Yeah, I would like to see a rally. Just put more into it this evening before the rollout. I need to recover a bit.... in 8 days when my money actually shows up...
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:38:45
Yup. Bought in a bit more just minutes before the bcash debacle. I feel your pain. I have only been in this for 6 weeks, but man am I sad seeing all my profit disappear.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:43:15
Yup. Made the same mistake a few weeks ago. Had 8 Litecoin at $84, 1 Ethereum at $447 and they jumped 12 hours after I sold. Lame me. Never again.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:12:08
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:17:55
Lucky. It was back up to $350 before I could.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:04:01
Right? This pisses me off. I literally just bought more at 7 and this shit goes down less that 15 minutes later. I’m so pissed.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:13:13
That’s what I am hoping for too.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:10:47
It’s frozen at 8k on the Coinbase App
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:50:29
Damn it guys. I go to get my kids ready for bed and btc dips down to 14k briefly and I missed the dip?!? WTH 
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:15:57
I am trying to figure the same thing out myself.
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:16:00
Read Dark Money by Jane Mayer. It explains ALOT.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:52:55
Thanks for the pep talks throughout the day today everyone. I didn’t give in at the bottom and doubled down a few times making some awesome gains this afternoon while litecoin was fluctuating. I made it through my first big gauntlet in relatively good shape.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:01:07
Dang. That is awesome dude. Congrats.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:06:47
Anyone have the skinny on why Litecoin is soaring? I had held onto 8 Ltc for three weeks and crickets. Then the day after I transferred them to btc they soared up by 150% the past few days. Totally kicking myself for not watching closer, but I was working all weekend. Is this just a bubble or is there something I don't see?
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:02:10
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:30:02
I’m out of money to buy the dip. Gah....
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:05:34
I don’t trust Coinbase now after this shady move. I just bought more at 7 and then this shit went down shortly after. I am hoping it will go back up, but I have been watching things closely and wasn’t prepared for a curve ball like that.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:18:26
I wonder if that will make it take off and fly?
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:16:09
They locked it up tight. No trading. What a crazy day...week...month...
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:11:59
did gdax just crash for anyone else?
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:36:07
but of course! it knows all. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:29:23
100% how I felt watching my currency today. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:44:17
I did the same thing. Wish I had YOLOed at $8200.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:30:35
Priorities. Paychecks go to bitcoin, not rent. Couches are great...for a while...
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:35:17
I hope
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:14:01
This is common place here in the US.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:30:57
Thanks for the pep talks throughout the day today everyone. I must admit I was a little panicky when I woke up at 2am last night and saw I was down another 25%. I didn’t give in at the bottom and ended up making some more gains on the margins this afternoon while litecoin was fluctuating. I made it through my first big gauntlet in relatively good shape. Phewf. What a rollercoaster!
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:13:19
Crap. I saw ltc drop to $299 and then checked.
