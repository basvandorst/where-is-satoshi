The thing is, without laws or regulations cryptos have been around since the beginning in Venezuela, cheap electricity and internet access has made a few early adopters very rich in the shadows, but still, the corrupt government would incarcerate and declare any income from crypto as money laundering, CICPC (sorta FBI) police would knock on your door and take away your crypto machines by extortion, offering jail time under fake crimes if you don't comply, you sure don't want to spend months waiting for a trial on a venezuelan jail. New laws offer a "legal" way to access crypto, but still, it's all government controlled and supervised, they would even want to know how much crypto you posses for  tax purposes, but that information could lead to kidnapping and even more extortion, also the requisites for acquiring cryptos are insane privacy-wise, then THE ELITE would just bypass all that (because corruption) and have an easy way to exchange their worthless bolivares stuck in Venezuela and have them exchanged into other crypto's which they could cash out in any other country easily.

Venezuela is not like the USA where you can buy an AK-47 almost in every city. People have fought but the military has bigger guns and they don't sweat it when it comes to shoot civilians, search youtube for "guarimbas"

Exactly even as insane as it may sound, people still prefer cash even if they have to carry with a wheelbarrow full of it.

Correction: bunch of narcos in charge of a country, looking to capture funds from risk investors and keep them in crypto so USA sanctions can't block the money, untraceable, probably their wallets are hidden in a safe on a tax paradise island waiting to be used once they have to flee the country like any other dethroned dictatorship.

Venezuelans dont trust virtual money, because "you can't touch it". Not going to happen on a mass scale.
