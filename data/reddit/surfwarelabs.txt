Good points. I purposely did not look at competitive products or even market research any of my ideas. The reasons are 1) everything has already been done, so it is discouraging to have a great idea and find some else has done it and 2) I would likely copy the ideas of competitive products, which would skew my vision and I would end up making a 'me too' product. While this is not a good strategy for an enterprise where shareholders are looking for a return on investment in a short term, it is an excellent strategy for a person where motivation is the key factor in success. If I got bored, I'd end up playing WoW instead of coding. And it worked, I've sold thousands of units. (yes, I could have sold tens of thousands if I would have done the research but likely would have given up before selling a single unit...)

Done. Thanks!

It right-click/saves thousands of times an hour, as selectively as the user sets. And I did get a nice email from a grandma (I assume) who uses it to download crochet templates from her favorite site. (She also uses it to download George Clooney images, but keep that on the low-down...)

I prefer the term 'hipster-ready'.

Well, I was referring to the main program, not anything to do with BitCoin. But since we are on the subject, I am a great fan of DLC (downloadable content) and I think BitCoin can really be implemented well for this. For example, a desktop publishing app would be fully functional, but the 'print to pdf' option would cost a few pennies to activate. Integrating that into the software would be nice.

[Here is the Buy Now options page,]( click the Bitcoin link. I know the site is Classic Hipster, so I'd just like comments on the Bitcoin part and if any simple things can be done to improve it. I don't want to register for any merchant sites at the moment. Thanks!

Yes we do. Sales were MUCH higher 10 years ago, but there are still people who prefer using our software. Done a few overhauls over the years, but kept the basics the same. The key is keeping the program logistics 'dumb', so it relies on brute-force and it spiders quite a bit faster than competitive products for many web sites. While I think it needs another overhaul, I'll keep getting positive feedback which makes me hold off a bit longer.

Yes, I can do the 75% discount (and take the exchange risk) because it is a soft item. It would be harder to do if I had a physical product to ship.

I haven't really used wget, but a lot of people make the comparison. Yes, a lot of free software does similar stuff (heck, our free version does 90% of the paid version), but it's about the look, feel, functionality and ease of use. Some people swear by our software, others prefer alternatives. That's why I suggest people try the free version before buying.

That is for the product. Download the free trial if interested, and if you think it's worthwhile, pm me. Thanks for your interest!

Excellent point, that's part of the reason I'm posting here, and probably the most important thing that I've learned today. Your other points have merit; we could argue back and forth about why someone would pay for something when something similar was free, etc. Also, it's written in Delphi 2007. Thanks for the feedback; maybe the next version will just be a frontend for wget!
