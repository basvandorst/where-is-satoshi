Where can I find your PCB design CAD source files?  (Eagle, KiCad, etc)
Mine is certainly not a 'perfect copy' -- it looks nothing alike.  Mine has two boards cobbled together, it has no case, etc.
I was able to make a piece of hardware that implements the schematic you posted.  It was not easy.  This matches no common definition of 'open source hardware' that I'm familiar with.
A common 'open hardware' definition is this one from the Open Source Hardware Association:  Criteria 1 of that standard includes the distribution of CAD files. A pdf of a schematic does not count.

The Trezor shield does NOT have the 'trezor CPU' on it -- Its just a breakout board for the screen and buttons, and the Trezor logic is simulated on the rpi's processor.
I would not recommend storing any real Bitcoins on such a device. Here be Dragons.
@_date: 2015-12-23 05:31:26
Roughly $25 each.
You bring up a good topic that I glossed over: the JTAG header.
To create the bootloader that I'm running in the video, I commented out the part of the bootloader code that write protects the bootloader memory sections and disables hardware debugging.  Therefore, in this software configuration, it is a dev unit not suitable for Bitcoin storage.
However, if I were to leave in the code that write protects the bootloader and disables hardware debugging, it is _identical_ to a Trezor from the perspective of hardware protections of private keys.  It clearly does not have a proper case, but is otherwise as suitable for Bitcoin storage as a Trezor is.
Furthermore, I'll be releasing code that makes it easy to bake in your own signature into your own bootloader that will verify your own firmwares.
@_date: 2015-12-08 12:35:55
Don't worry -- the story isn't over. There will be a few more videos posted before the end of the year. :)
@_date: 2015-12-08 15:15:32
I would hope that a hardware wallet manufacturer would refuse to sell blank versions of their product when the normal version of the product has a locked bootloader.
Someone could program an evil bootloader and distribute them as normal versions.
I'll talk about this more in an upcoming video.

The pi + trezor shield is effectively a Trezor API simulator, good for developing code, but it does not have the security properties of the STM32F205 chip.

oh geez, that bad?
@_date: 2015-12-05 15:52:15
Some folks and myself have done some static analysis of the 1.2.0 bootloader binary, and the differences appear to be pretty benign - change in strings, etc.
But my analysis was certainly not exhaustive, and there's no reason why I should have to go through that level of effort to determine the changes in an 'open source' product.
In this series of videos I want to explain the security properties of the Trezor as objectively as possible.  One large part of this is the trust you place in the manufacturer of the hardware wallet and the accuracy of their claims.
Its up to the end user to determine if the level of trust and associated risk as acceptable for their particular use case.
@_date: 2015-12-14 00:50:48
Good point - I can't find a download for either the eWallet source or firmware binaries.  Yet another reason to stay away from the Black Arrow eWallet.
The blank eWallets with the wire loop came to me just like you see it there.  That's not a mod that I made; I asked them for a method of changing the BOOT0 pin, and that was the method they came up with and shipped me.  They are willing to produce these for me in bulk at full retail cost.  I considered asking if they could do a run like this in a different color (as to look distinct from the standard eWallets), but I dont have the funds to cover the costs.
The takeaway for now is they are willing to sell blanks identical to their locked bootloader product, so be careful -- especially when purchasing from a third party.
@_date: 2015-12-23 22:19:46
Well, shoot.  I stand corrected!
You should publicize this more.  I follow you guys pretty closely and I completely missed this.
Well done!
@_date: 2015-12-05 17:27:21
I dont know what you mean by 'move on with 1.2.5'.  The bootloader is not upgradable.
One thing I will be demonstrating is that the Trezor is not 'fully open source', and that you are trusting SatoshiLabs to some extent when you use a Trezor.
I agree that trying to find a trustworthy company is missing the point; I want a hardware wallet where the amount of trust I put into third parties approaches zero.
@_date: 2015-12-08 20:38:42
I am learning that the text-based posts have been more popular in general.
I have a few more videos to post, but I'll also go back and at least type up a summary.
@_date: 2015-12-01 04:53:48
When loading in a firmware that does not match SatoshiLabs' signature, the bootloader erases the private key.
This is to prevent the attack you describe
(this is a simplified explanation)
@_date: 2015-12-08 15:09:23
Completely agree.
However, it becomes confusing when SatoshiLabs makes claims that the Trezor is 'completely open source hardware and software'.  This might lead consumers to believe that the Trezor is completely open source hardware and software when it is not.
@_date: 2015-12-23 20:46:13

I've been (slowly) putting together a detailed photo tutorial for BitcoinBriefcase, but it is taking much longer than I expected.
So I'll post a basic parts list, schematic, and alpha-quality code this weekend.
The assembled unit price on the website is deliberately high due to the labor involved, and to encourage building one yourself :)
@_date: 2014-10-25 15:42:23
You can write and run your own firmware that dumps the bootloader.
@_date: 2014-10-13 04:29:49
I'd love to.  Where's the bootloader code?
@_date: 2014-10-02 13:47:01
Here's an example:
@_date: 2014-10-01 03:41:57


Yeah. . .
While certainly in the realm of possible, this level of effort should not be necessary for a product marketed as having open software.
@_date: 2014-10-01 00:47:09


I have no reason to believe that they didn't do this.
(also, no evidence that they did :p )
Having full source available helps validate the claims.
@_date: 2014-10-02 13:15:40
The hardware is open source?
Where can I find the hardware design files?
@_date: 2014-10-02 13:33:45


Based on what?
@_date: 2014-01-06 05:46:00
Unless you are selling very high value items (&gt;25 BTC or so), just seeing the valid transaction broadcast on the network is good enough.  The amount of capital necessary to pull off a doublespend is more profitable for a potential attacker to just mine with.  Even with 0 confirmations!
And I agree that accepting Bitpay is different than accepting Bitcoin.  If you are immediately converting to fiat, then your support of Bitcoin is somewhat superficial.  Its still better than not accepting Bitpay, though :)

@_date: 2015-05-20 16:07:36
It would be in the interest of large miners to increase the number of mined Bitcoins.
And it would take the large miners working together to change the rules, so maybe its not quite as impossible as we assume to pull it off?

Also, OpenDime is not Open Source:

Can you give it a healthy swapfile?
That's how I was able to get an rpi to run a full node without oom errors.
Slow as heck, but it worked.
@_date: 2015-01-28 02:31:10
why not?
@_date: 2015-01-27 22:33:04
All true. 
But if trezor 'wanted' and 'hoped' that there wouldn't be clones, they shouldn't have marketed and released their product as open source.
Seems like they want the benefits of both open and closed, and the downsides of neither. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 14:09:57
Not necessarily.
I think the best comparison to Trezor is Arduino.  Arduino sells inexpensive hardware and software based on an open source license.
"Arduino" is trademarked, but there are tons of compatible clones out there that make the arduino ecosystem stronger.
@_date: 2015-01-30 14:17:50
Its possible that now fewer people will purchase a Trezor (or clone) wallet and use an alternate solution, and there will be less incentive for the Trezor devs to support their product in the future.
Certainly not a direct effect, but 'not at all' isnt correct either.
@_date: 2015-01-28 01:03:55

If you compile it yourself, you can be fairly sure you didn't insert a backdoor without your knowledge. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 21:37:58


Arguably not an "open source" license.
@_date: 2015-01-28 01:07:50
Right, so they needed to be open to be a credible security product.
And part of being open is the ability for clones to be created.  This is absolutely foreseeable, and comes with the territory.
Its just part of the business model of being a company that sells open-source products.
To rephrase your comment: Who would have bought or used a Trezor that someone couldn't identically clone?  ;)

The sum of the block reward and tips are to pay miners for mining. As the former decreases, the latter would need to increase to maintain current miners' interest. 
If we tweak the protocol to not allow fees to afford higher fees, then we also need to change the block reward algorithm. Or accept fewer miners' participation.
As a user, you can choose to pay to ride this bus, or wait and try and catch the next. Don't expect miners to not desire to maximize tips in their blocks. 
@_date: 2016-02-13 15:52:42

Double plus thumbs up!
This is why I'm an advocate of [building your hardware wallet yourself](
Building your own open MCU would be nice, but will probably remain out of reach for a while.  Until then, we need to remain educated about the systems that we trust our money to, and validate manufacturer's claims with design analysis and empirical tests. 
@_date: 2016-02-25 00:29:02

Yep, that's how markets work. 
@_date: 2016-02-13 17:12:15
I'm also fine with having many product designs on the market that cover the 'convenient vs secure' spectrum, and let the consumer choose what is best for their use case.
I'm _not_ okay with unsubstantiated claims of '100% secure' or 'hacker proof' coming from marketing departments.
I like to think that I'm putting these claims to test on stellaw.info and helping to educate potential buyers of these products.

The paper packed in the box warns the user that the device is modifiable (in bold), and due to that nature, you are not liable. 
So, yeah, I wouldn't trust it.

Again, you're trusting the device's output, which we are assuming is not a trustworthy device.
see the disconnect?
@_date: 2015-04-03 19:44:22

I thought you said that firmware can only be flashed if it's signed. Can I flash my own custom firmware, or not?
Is the device modifiable or 'practically bulletproof'?
@_date: 2015-09-26 17:27:56
Eh, I think that's a bit of a stretch.
I think it's just a fact about their manufacturing process. Not a pro or a con. 
@_date: 2015-09-27 13:46:45
Yes, I did have to go a bit caveman on it due to the black goo. I was expecting to put in time and effort roughly equivalent to competing products. 
This is a hobby I do at a personal cost -- a more professional teardown would have added a couple hours holding a heatgun. And that does not sound like fun to me, so I didn't do it. 
@_date: 2015-09-26 20:43:59
You are not going to change my opinion on this one. 
I've taken many hardware wallets apart, and the Case is made of the most delicate materials.
The ribbon connector for the keypad is exposed, and the screen is fragile. The buttons rub on the surface when set down on its face.
*All* other wallets I've looked at still remain usable after I've torn them apart. Case is more fragile than those. 
@_date: 2015-09-26 21:35:51
Agreed.  Bitcoins send to a Case are not really yours anymore. edit: (in 'recommended' configuration)
@_date: 2015-09-26 19:31:17
Agreed. Case has 'tamper evident' qualities.
I'd also call it fragile. 
@_date: 2015-09-26 18:02:01
I also think it's important to protect private keys properly -- it's money; this is important to get right. 
I get especially annoyed by wild claims made by manufacturers in this industry. "Most secure".  "Unhackable". 
@_date: 2015-09-26 21:34:54
The build quality is not terrible, and its not great.
There's more reasons to not use this beyond build quality.
@_date: 2015-09-26 22:52:56
No, I have not.  Have these been available for purchase?
@_date: 2015-09-26 23:07:41
Clearly, we disagree.
And prolonging the back and forth here isnt helping anybody.
@_date: 2015-09-26 22:40:56
Alright, this is getting stupid.
Air resistance does exist, but is negligible for distances of a couple meters and objects of the relevant size and shape.
It remains that I have far more confidence in any of the other hardware wallet's build robustness than the Case.
@_date: 2015-09-26 23:08:36
If you have a line on any, I'd be happy to purchase two.

Is the attestation code open? 
@_date: 2015-09-26 22:33:46
I'm not going to answer that question right now.
Since I'm kinda becoming the 'hardware wallet guy', that's a pretty Big Question.
I'll have a more thorough answer soon, but for now I'll say that each has its tradeoffs, and none of them have my full confidence.
For normal consumers working with a small to medium amount of Bitcoin, any hardware wallet is better than not using one.
If you are an institution, are dealing with Large amounts of Bitcoin, or a wearer of heavy-duty tinfoil hats, then none of today's hardware wallets suffice.
I'll be putting together a big comparison chart with my thoughts on each that I will post on stellaw.info.
@_date: 2015-09-26 17:39:18
No source code published; I don't trust it. 
Also, I don't agree with the model of not personally controlling all of my public keys. TNOFTW
Also the registration process required giving them personal information. I do not understand why. 
That said, I haven't spent much time using the device. More to come soon. 
@_date: 2015-09-27 13:39:47
To be clear, I have no issues with Trezor forks.  They are operating within the terms of the Trezor license. If Trezor did not want these products to exist, they should not have chosen a license that allowed it. 
My comment was solely about the price of the KeepKey. From what I have experienced so far, there's not an extra $140 worth of value to justify the KeepKey's price. 
@_date: 2015-09-26 18:09:30

We had a special request for fast delivery come in, so we're going to be assembling the first several with a speedy turnaround.  Today we ordered parts and began code cleanup.
Our most common request is for a bill acceptor.  I have a part on order and will be seeing how we can integrate the capability.  Once we've had the chance to develop and test, we'll post an update to the site.
Its all rather experimental, and we're doing this as a hobby.  We're slapping the 'alpha' tag on it because there's probably going to be some rough edges and bugs in the code that we'll work out as we go.  These units are best suited for tinkerers who are willing to help troubleshoot and collaborate.
The alpha units are build-to-order, and we love customization requests. One customer is sending us samples of Euro coins so that we can configure his unit for his local currency.
And in the spirit of getting Bitcoins in the hands of more people, we want to get BitcoinBriefcases in the hands of more people, too.  Once we make the code a bit more presentable, it will all be posted free and open-source so you can build one yourself.

I'm disappointed that Trezor built their company on the promise of open source hardware and open source software, and then abandon that concept when convenient.
Yes, this is within their rights, but not what I want to see from the company that asks us to trust their products to protect our money.
I thought they learned the lesson already with the previous rounds of not releasing bootloader source and changing to MS licensing with significant backlash, but here we see more of the same questionable behavior.
Unfortunately, Trezor is still the best choice in the bitcoin hardware wallet market.

This is a good idea; We'll add a page on our site for new users to be able to get started.

BitcoinBriefcase.com for more info.
These are Alpha units -- bugs and rough edges are expected.
I'm presently working on incorporating a bill acceptor into the prototype.  After a bill acceptor, battery power is the next most frequent request.
The difficult part about this project is that I made the original only ever intending it to be a one-off POC.  These alpha units are hand assembled and take about 12 hours of labor to produce, and therefore my hourly 'wage' in assembling one is equivalent to less than minimum wage -- and that's not sustainable for a project I do in my free time.
We are working through the backlog of Alpha orders, and in parallel are making improvements to the software and hardware design -- all of which will be posted open source.
We are still taking orders for these coin acceptor alpha units for 5BTC, but expect the price for Beta units to go up if we continue to hand assemble.

Owning one bitcoin is exclusively having the right to transfer the ability to transfer that bitcoin to somebody else to somebody else.

Yes, the current methods for getting data in and out of the NES are what is taking the majority of the time.
If the NES were hashing 100% of the time using the compiled C implementation of the sha256 I'm currently using, I'd guess it could hit 100 hash/s.  Implementing my own sha256 routine in 6502 assembly would make a big improvement over cc65, getting maybe up to 500-1000 hash/s

Are you coming from an ip in the US?
They recently announced that they were not accepting transactions from US ips.
This may be the way they are handling those transactions

We'll post a writeup this week with details about how we built it.
We thought people might like it, but we did not expect the huge positive response.  We are considering doing a kickstarter or contacting Adafruit to sell kits.  However, I'd rather spend my free time on some next project rather than manufacturing this one.
I'm glad you like it!

We got a couple models of bill acceptors in to test and implement, and we are going to focus on bill acceptors as a feature after we've shipped the current batch of orders.
Look for a video of a bill acceptor in our prototype by the end of the month.  I hope to have it working by Derbycon.  I'll post updates at bitcoinbriefcase.com as we go.

send them as a transaction with zero outputs so they will all be considered tips.
Tips are claimed by the miner who mines the block with that contains that transaction.

One minute in:
"and really a Bitcoin transaction between Alice and Bob amounts to a specially constructed sequence of numbers that Alice will basically send over to Bob"
No no no no no.
This does not happen.  The details are important if you are trying to understand how things work.

We're doing all of those things!
We are selling fully-assembled Briefcases at 
We we are creating these initial alpha units, we are cleaning up the code and making improvements to the hardware design to make the Briefcase lighter, faster, and more reliable.  In the next couple weeks, both the code and a detailed hardware tutorial will be posted for free.

How about the BFL ASIC Jalepenos then?  Those also connect over USB.
@_date: 2013-03-25 00:24:03
Yep, that's a decent estimate.  To get it closer to 1 hash/s I could remove some arbitrary sleeps() that I threw in, among any number of optimizations.  The bottleneck is not the NES's cpu, not by a long shot.
My goal in development was to just get it working rather than to optimize for speed.  I'm a believer in always making a 'shitty first draft' first rather than to spend too much time in planning.  'shitty first draft' mentality gets code on the screen faster.

The standard alpha models are powered from the wall.
After bill acceptors, battery power is the most requested feature, and it is something we will be researching.
During my experiences showing the prototype, I've always found a wall socket when I've looked for one.  They really are everywhere, and you start developing a knack for spotting them.
Email us at info with your requests, and we can get into more details about your use case.
@_date: 2013-08-26 02:24:33
From my limited understanding of bill acceptors, you need to purchase a unit for the currency you want to accept (non-configurable).  If you want to accept USD, buy the USD part.
The coin acceptors, however, are configurable.  You put the coin acceptor into 'learning' mode and insert 20 samples of each coin you want to accept.  Our prototype has an acceptor that takes up to four coins (pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters), but for alpha units we are using acceptors that take up to 6 (or 8!) different coins.
If you send us samples of the coins (or tokens) you want the Briefcase to accept, we're happy to do the configuration and currency exchange math for you.

I'm part of the group that build this machine.
Five of us were curious to see if we could build a box that accepted pocket change and dispense BTC, so we tried, and we did it.
It was just a hobbyist project, and we have no plans for producing or selling these. (We also had no idea that anybody would be interested in purchasing them either -- if you have lots of money to invest in us, send me a PM)
Its been a pretty big hit at DEF CON.  Most people are aware of what Bitcoin is, but for many the $.37 wallet we printed out today is the first BTC they own.  And I think that's pretty cool.
We are charging 15% markup from mtgox prices to cover the cost of the hardware involved.  I'm up front about it, and most people are just happy to get rid of their pocket change.
The wallet we are pulling from is:
 1QJ16vamv9gqmBYzse3r8xvpqzt4jdLf7L 
If you dig it, you can send donations there, and your coins will make their way into some DEF CON goers first ever wallet.
For another hilarious Bitcoin project I've worked on in the past, see: retrominer.com.  After DEF CON is over, I'll do a writeup about how we put this box together.
I'm glad you guys like it!
@_date: 2013-08-02 23:35:51
Yep.  This is to get BTC into the hands of more people.
We're not going to make money accepting pennies with this box.  There's about $350 of parts in the box, and in two days we've accepted about $110.  So at 15% markup, I've made $17.  Another $332 and I'll break even on the project.
Fun is what hobbies are supposed to be about, right?

BTC generation rate is effectively zero.  I'll jump up and down if that screen ever turns green, but even still all that means is that I've created the lowest possible proof-of-work for slush's pool, which is still basically zero BTC

The Briefcase makes it easy for someone to purchase their first Bitcoins with the change they have in their pocket.
If you are performing ROI calculations to see how long it will be until profitable, then a box that makes margins on 37 cent transactions probably isnt for you.
If you are looking to spread knowledge of Bitcoins to your local makerspace, hackerspace, LUG, or other gathering of people who should know more about Bitcoins, then the Briefcase is perfect.  We are also adding a feature where a portion of the transaction value can be configured to go to a cause or charity.
We are working on offering an option to add a bill acceptor to your Briefcase.  We have a couple sample bill acceptors that we are working with, and look for a video of a bill acceptor in our prototype at the end of the month.
@_date: 2013-08-02 11:16:01
