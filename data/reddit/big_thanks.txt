What are the x-axes supposed to be? Day 1 - the image date?

Can *you* explain to me why the timeframe is "30-50 years?"

Why is a log scale “correct”?
@_date: 2018-07-30 19:10:28
That's such an oversimplification of my point that I  honestly have nothing to say.

At the end if the day wasn't he formally charged with money laundering and conspiracy to traffic drugs? I agree that he didn't deserve a life sentence but I also don't think he's 100% innocent.

That doesn't mean it didn't happen? I get that it's easy to cling on to that fact as meaning he's 100% innocent but there are several reasons why a prosecutor may drop charges in a case.

I agree completely that his sentence is extremely harsh and undeserving of the crimes he committed. That said, I don't understand why some of his supporters think he is 100% innocent of all wrongdoing.

Sure thing, I'll get right on trying to find out "how the US legal system works." Shouldn't be more than a couple Wikipedia pages, yeah?

I'm really not aware of all the intricacies of the case so I don't have a perfect answer for you. 
If I had to guess I would say that pursuing attempted murder charges when you have enough solid evidence for other crimes could complicate the entire case. I.e., if the evidence for attempted murder was not strong it could weaken their position on the other crimes if presented.
My point is that there are many reasons why prosecutors will drop charges but keep others.

Dude it's just an opinion on a bitcoin thread -- loosen up a bit. I'm guessing most people here aren't legal experts and I'm certainly not pretending to be.

Thanks for the clarification. This cleared things up for me a lot and makes more sense.
