My uncle changed the name of his car wash business to Crypto-Car Wash... He just landed a 5-year deal with Hertz and Avis.

You all realize the reason all these futures are popping up is because everyone wants to short the hell out of bitcoin.

I don't own any crypto and I wish Bitcoin becomes very successful in the end. However, I see MAJOR PROBLEMS that need to be addressed:
* 1- Bitcoin is still prone to hackings, to include exchanges, mobile  and desktop wallets. YOUR MONEY IS NOT SAFE.
* 2- Transaction fees are ridiculous high.
* 3- Hardly anyone accepts Bitcoin unlike Visa.
* 4- When u go from $990 to $20000 in one year ITS A BUBBLE.
* 5- Bitcoin is not backed by anything (though that's the idea).
* 6- Lack of regulation (at least for the time being)
* 7- Mt Gox could happen again. Yes, it can.

Bitcoin has as much life as Hillary's presidential campaign.
