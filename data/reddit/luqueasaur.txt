I love to see how some people think it's brainwashed to have a system that already works extremely well on certain parts of the world and is benefiting for the people as a whole... Hate on what you don't know man, that's what you were taught. When you get an accident (I'm not wishing that for ya btw, heck I'd feel sorrier for your fees than for your physical damage) worth hundreds of thousands of dollars you'll see how brainwashed Europeans who'd pay not a single cent are. Hopefully you can see that through a trip to Europe, not by biting your tongue.

Thousands of Americans die every year because they can't afford medical supplies and you're worries about "illegal aliens going to the doctor for a flu"? If such stupidity bothers you so much, you know, the Healthcare system can always demand a citizen ID... But then again that would be stupid. In reality that's just a poor excuse.

Sheesh, I guess the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is a democratic republic because that's what it's called.... but alright, nice to know insurance plans ain't as bad as media portraits.

And why should anyone trust a company? Capitalists always says "businesses are in for the money, not for charity" which would apply to a hospital. Fuck no I wouldn't trust a doctor who's in for the money, willing to milk as much cash as possible from me.
Source: I live in a country where you need to have Healthcare and doctors ALWAYS like to make you buy frivolous medicines and never wants you to do exams (because they're expensive and that would be covered by the insurance).

*several European countries have free Healthcare which permits taking care of health for free *
"dis is death"
*in murica millions of people are heavily indebted anytime they go to hospitals and some hundreds if not thousands die of health complications because they can't afford taking care of their health. All while the gvnt spends billions on jets and innocent people killing drones *
"dis is good" 
My God, sometimes the American nationalism is incomprehensible. The ideological irrationality borders ridiculousness. Can you really hear yourself? Anyone who's been in European countries with Healthcare system prefers it than America's ridiculous "pay not to die out of a flu" thing.

Don't be fooled. Exceptions are exceptions.

Of course it's not true UBI because it still doesn't even exist. It's for experimental purposes on research of the effects of having guaranteed money on people who seldom do have it.

Man, bitcoin has fallen 25%.... and its price is the same price from early December. A quarter value crash only brings the coin back to the month beginning's value. Even if it lost 1/6 of its value like in 2013 - which would only happen with a cataclysmic event beyond our wildest dreams - It would go to... 3,3k. And then it would rise again, and at the next month, it would be around 6k.
The price is still very high; have you considered selling a portion with equal value to what you invested? I think this would make you feel calmer, to know that no matter what happen you didn't lose money. But then again you might feel guilty for "not maximizing profits", so you pick what you think it's best for you.

I'm glad bitcoin has become mainstream as an investment rather than technology and likewise gave birth to exaggerated coverage, price speculation that renders its purpose rather meaningless and a bunch of fake adds.
No really, thank you

Well, I certainly appreciate your pragmatism. If everyone in this sub was like this then we wouldn't be seeing a "hodl to make money" circlejerk, rather than discussion about the technology, here.

This guy is just pointing the obvious: stock markets aren't dying and bitcoin isn't full fledgedly recovering. If you think this is absurd perhaps you're the troll here

Just watch his show. Seek for the most outrageous episodes. Look the drama of his child custody - not even the judges beared his shit. I'm not his biggest far nor hater so I dont know the details, all I know is that I've seen he ain't stable and anyone can too if they're willing to look at it.

As a cryptocurrency, not as an investment....

Dude is a mentally unstable liar. Just because he points out shit someone you dislike did doesn't mean he's reliable at all. In fact he deserves a "no platform" policy af

I love how even at 4chan there are anons there who recognize what a scummy thing to do it is to steal their "friend" 's money.
