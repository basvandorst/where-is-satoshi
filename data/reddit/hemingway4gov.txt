NO not yet. This is my 2nd AMA. 
@_date: 2014-08-20 16:14:53
Im not sure I fully understand your question. Could  you expound?

Yes. This is from my site: “There’s no reason that New York has to be the world financial capital for Bitcoin,” said Hemingway. “New Hampshire had more Bitcoin nodes in the early days than any other state and a state motto of ‘Live Free or Die.’ My Administration would look for ways to stimulate, not stifle, the growth of Bitcoin as an industry.”
Hemingway’s pro-Bitcoin platform also includes the following elements:
•    Accepting Bitcoins as payment for taxes and fees statewide. 
•    No added regulation on Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies statewide. 
•    Pro-Bitcoin initiatives to encourage innovation, including uses of the blockchain to make government more efficient.

On abortion: The Supreme Court is the only body capable of making changes. As Gov I have a very limited role in that discussion. 
@_date: 2014-08-20 16:38:44
Yes I would. I would make reforms so that it accurately reflects our Constitution.

The Bitlicense essentially regulates Bitcoin to death. NH will pass BitLiberty. A plan to incentivize innovation around BItcoin and Blockchain tech.

The impact on transparency is revolutionary. I believe that this tech change the way Govts operate and function. They will be streamlined, transparent, and accountable. This is why I believe many Bureaucrats are fighting this tech ie. Bitlicense. They do not want accountability or transparency.

I think that the block chain technology has HUGE implications for Governance. I recently said that with properly applied Blockchain you could condense the entire Govt to about 12 cubicles. I believe this to be true. All contracts, licenses, taxes, etc. could be streamlined and made hugely efficient using Bitcoin 2.0 and Blockchain tech. The first state to do this will have an enormous competitive advantage.

I would take a hands off approach. Meaning that the same regulations a state has on cash would be adequate to apply to Cryptos. No one when you spend a dollar asks where did this dollar come from? I would do the same in NH. “There’s no reason that New York has to be the world financial capital for Bitcoin,” said Hemingway. “New Hampshire had more Bitcoin nodes in the early days than any other state and a state motto of ‘Live Free or Die.’ My Administration would look for ways to stimulate, not stifle, the growth of Bitcoin as an industry.”

NO problem. Infrastructure is critical to NH moving forward and leading this country. We need to make it a priority and right now it is on the back burner. I would change that. I would make sure it received the necessary funding.

Cash has been used for centuries to conduct cons, and buy drugs as well. It is not the currency that needs regulation. 
@_date: 2014-08-20 16:30:14
The possibilities are endless! imagine real time accounting of Govt spending? What ways you do think they could be applied?

Yes. This is exactly how&gt; “There’s no reason that New York has to be the world financial capital for Bitcoin,” said Hemingway. “New Hampshire had more Bitcoin nodes in the early days than any other state and a state motto of ‘Live Free or Die.’ My Administration would look for ways to stimulate, not stifle, the growth of Bitcoin as an industry.”

I use a service called Paystand. 
@_date: 2014-08-20 16:08:37
We use a service that converts to cash immediately. So all finance laws are obeyed because it is all cash.
