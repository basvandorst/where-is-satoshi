The on-chain BTC doesn't go to the person who put it in the network, it goes on-chain to whoever has it on LN. There is no way to charge-back.

When you make those two LN transactions they are signed, so the receivers can't change them without knowing your private key.

Unless somebody gave it those things.

Perhaps those things were given by some conqueror, many hundreds of years ago.
I mean, for a long time things worked exactly how you are describing, with individuals charging for security and use of their property, then some individuals got so powerful that they *became governments*.

How do corporations or people own things to steal?
Why is the private security allowed to force you to give up things if the government can't?

What happens when you steal from a government which can't force you to do anything?

Who would give up their money voluntarily?
@_date: 2017-08-27 03:05:36


Governments can charge fees for usage of things (e.g. bridge tolls) just like corporations. They can also be voluntarily given things by people (perhaps in exchange for something else). Is that illegitimate?


So you can be forced to give up things if you agreed to it, irrevocably, once? Can you encumber your children so, or do they need to agree once they reach the age of majority (not that there's anyone to enforce that...)?

Can you change the block timestamps (which is what the EDA uses) without changing the hash?
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:16:59
EDA can only kick in when blocks are mined - it's when the blocks 6 and 12 blocks ago have too much time between them.

So the only civilized government is no government?
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:52:00
Your chain would have to have more work (difficulty * blocks), not more blocks, to be accepted.

Because after Bitcoin Cash people realized that forking gives you an instant customer base for your new altcoin.

Forex is definitely frowned upon in @_date: 2017-05-25 15:59:14
Money given (perhaps indirectly) to an income-producing venture, in exchange for the return of a share of that income.
Bitcoin is an asset like equities, bonds, commodities, and currencies, but not an investment like equities or bonds.

Because it's what organized crime used to do.
