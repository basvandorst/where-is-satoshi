right ok fair enough, there is a degree to which thats true
@_date: 2016-08-15 22:25:02
wbn on youtube 101 series very good.
@_date: 2016-08-15 20:28:06
if satoshi said why, i dont remember lol. i think he thought it would be an appropriate amount.
@_date: 2016-08-08 20:21:56
a bit more objectivity please
@_date: 2016-08-17 01:13:12
... thats why they back up their data...
@_date: 2016-08-14 23:46:11
Kind of inaccurate. Eth is having problems, etc isnt getting over 200 mill easily, steem is too inflationary and people are bailing becuase of that. alts are having alot of problems. dash is up for the moment, but the market cap is still under 100 mill. i think btc is safe. also LTC is all but dead, no ability to rally at all
@_date: 2016-08-15 05:53:38
well, thats your opinion. 30 mins is still much faster than western union or bank wire transfers. and 10 mins is the average. this isnt a major problem, or a problem at all really
@_date: 2016-08-29 09:04:28
ya good news is that it really should be dropping out of mempool though, 3 more days
@_date: 2016-08-31 05:24:52
No one has to handle it
@_date: 2016-08-06 08:27:03
Yeah i think so.
@_date: 2016-08-15 07:37:25
this doesnt make sense, why not just back up their data? plus they hate btc.
@_date: 2016-08-05 21:16:29
Personally no. I never traded on bfx, but the fact their PR person is an arrogant 23 year old who talks down to users who just lost their life savings, shows what kind of company they are, they dont give a flying fuck about what happened
@_date: 2016-08-31 05:25:32
sure, if a tree falls in the woods and no one is there to hear it, did it really fall? of course, the answer is yes
@_date: 2016-08-22 01:20:14
in my opinion, it should get mined. however the last diff. adjustment pushed difficulty very high. others will say tx will fall out of the mempool within 3 days. in my experience it can stay in limbo for 2 weeks, then the coins are just returned to the sending wallet. i think your tx should get mined tonight though.
@_date: 2016-08-15 22:04:34
Boom! there it is. starting to get worried for a second. lol but Its no problem, hashrate must have taken a cut lately, will sort itself out eventually
@_date: 2016-08-15 07:34:27
yes i will do it
@_date: 2016-08-15 20:23:59
uhm Its better to buy more now, price isnt going to go much lower only higher from here. its near the bottom. but yes of course its always good to swap fiat out for btc
@_date: 2016-08-15 22:13:47
Yes you dont want to lose your .dat file. strong password is a must, walletrecovery guy says 15 character passsword min
@_date: 2016-08-01 23:12:58
dont worry about it, core devs arent that dumb
@_date: 2016-08-15 20:22:15
weve moved past the high inflationary period, and scaling issues are about to be solved with the release of segwit. along with a few other big issues as well including tx mal.
@_date: 2016-08-21 23:49:46
well you have to trade you fiat in for bitcoin at some point, if they refuse to do that, then they wont have btc.
@_date: 2016-08-28 00:09:29
Its going to take time for more people to realize bitcoins value. When we some real financial instability in europe in about 3 years, many people will move to bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-07 19:59:37
post the tx id for fucks sake
@_date: 2016-08-15 05:55:16
I think its kind of annoying when people say a coin is manipulated, there is no naked shorting or ability to create coins out of thin air, so it isnt manipulated. if someone wants to sell to keep the price down, they have to buy first, which pushes up price.
@_date: 2016-04-24 13:37:28
yep, about 2 million coins are lost forever, including satoshis. if satoshi can move his coins, then about 1 mill are lost.
@_date: 2016-04-21 13:42:59
this is what i want to know as well, usually in these instances, the BTC is never encrypted
@_date: 2016-04-22 13:58:42
how do you figure?
@_date: 2016-08-15 20:25:37
as long as you can keep your private keys safe and have a strong password, youll be good. its been a long time since weve heard of a theft from someone storing their btc on their own pc.
@_date: 2016-04-21 13:42:09
well all he needed was a password on his bitcoins and he was safe, so its not "too techy". 
And bitcoin is going to the moon without you, well wave down @ you once were up there
@_date: 2016-04-28 19:37:16
yeah, the unconfirmed tx is very high and blocks are full , thats the indicator
@_date: 2016-04-21 13:42:29
well all he needed was a password on his btc and he would have been fine
@_date: 2016-04-21 13:40:51
actually its not, he doesnt need to be an expert, but he did need a password on his coins
@_date: 2016-04-30 19:30:18
well its an open ledger, or permission-less. so no one can be blocked, even scammers. I dont think too many people are supporting open scammers
@_date: 2016-04-21 13:39:43
very sad, the question i always ask is, did you have your btc encrypted?, was there a password on it?
@_date: 2016-04-22 13:58:20
whats a rat? i dont think they are useless
@_date: 2015-12-29 21:30:22
15% minumum up to 30%
@_date: 2015-12-03 09:28:45
Yeah its not free, its costs about 2 pennies to be sure your transaction will be processed within the next few blocks. When people say its free , they should say its very cheap instead. as people have said, it can be free but often isnt
@_date: 2015-12-19 21:57:51
check out electrum
@_date: 2015-12-03 11:20:22
actually this isnt bad because, if what you say is true, you are just burning coins, which helps the rest of the hodlers. And there is a chance that person will buy 5k bitcoin maybe a year or two out. slim chance but hey maybe its worth it
@_date: 2015-12-03 09:32:04
I dont know alot about RBF But eric voorhees doesnt like it so ill agree its bad
@_date: 2015-12-03 09:17:49
no but a quick check of the block explorers shows the latest blocks arent full, two of them are in the 100 kb range. and colored coins arent even a real thing yet... so... are you just a whiner?
@_date: 2015-12-03 12:36:44
thats true but whats wrong with 2mb cap instead of 8mb
@_date: 2015-12-03 09:22:54
slow down breh its 8mb blocks not 8gb blocks holy shit
@_date: 2015-12-03 08:07:50
I happen to agree with him, it is very aggressive. For the moment, btc is working just fine, many blocks are in the 200-400 kb range so the immediate need for bigger blocks isnt there. Instead of insisting on 8mb, it needs to be smaller, start with 2 or 2.5 mb max. 8mb isnt needed yet, wont be needed soon, and there is the big issue of mining decentralization with big blocks.
@_date: 2015-12-03 09:18:50
I thought the 1mb limit was still in place. 2mb i think is more conservative than 8mb, I agree with charlie in that sense.
@_date: 2015-12-03 09:19:49
i mean thats part of bitcoin isnt it, the small transactions are great. thats why they have TB harddrives, calm down you wont run out of harddrive space anytime soon.
@_date: 2015-12-03 09:17:07
whos bragging about it? also I disagree, there is alot of mining distribution worldwide, and the problem is not as bad today as it has been in the past
@_date: 2015-12-23 17:29:37
haha, im the same as you, got into it when it spiked to 1100. but didnt buy until the price fell to 230. 
Why didnt you buy this summer @ 200 euros?? very odd. welp, your loss.
Id say make sure you get atleast 1 btc regardless of the price, so that you have some exposure. after that, buy the dips
The price, is unlikely to drop now. the halving is in our sight, and the buy pressure has appeared.
ROFL and yes its definitely too late to invest in mining, especially in the last few months. 
@_date: 2017-02-27 17:07:43
you lot discarded the illuminati around a century ago, but the driving force behind the illuminati still exists today.

@_date: 2017-02-26 06:59:14
nice post, and libertarians saw this early, we understood economics early on, and were sharper than many others, which is why i dont understand people who criticize libertarians in bitcoin
@_date: 2016-01-07 13:27:01
LOL, wow so many people missed the buying oppurtunity this past summer, hard to believe for me but ok. Depends on your exposure. if you have NO BTC, thes yes buy 1 just to have some exposure. that way if it does go to the moon, youre exposed. but any big buys, is very risky now.
@_date: 2017-02-03 22:18:11
nope, youre gucci
@_date: 2017-02-26 06:57:30
nice assesment
@_date: 2016-01-07 13:40:28
who cares? It wont go as fast as it can, it will only go as fast as it will.
@_date: 2016-01-07 13:27:40
i would agree if it was but in bitcoin you should get some good advice
@_date: 2016-01-25 19:23:55
what is bitcoin days destroyed?
@_date: 2016-01-07 20:20:35
why are u upset?
@_date: 2016-06-19 02:03:50
ROFL, epic post. how low is eth gonna go?
@_date: 2016-06-17 20:14:05
Yeah, nice way to meme this guy. deserved. when i saw him say that, i thought "wow this guy has no clue what hes talking about." great post
@_date: 2016-06-12 23:51:07
yeah this isnt unusual.  it has to rally harder, alot harder for media to care that much
@_date: 2016-06-13 04:19:52
so you sold your position then right?
@_date: 2016-06-17 03:17:53
No, this is normal and I totally agree with you. The large blockers make much noise about nothing. the spam attacks stopped because all they can do is push up unconfirmed tx's. they cant push the price of the tx fee's up very much though, and only temporary. every night for months, before this recent run up, unconfirm tx would fall to 1500 level, VERY low. 
these people make too much noise for what is a very small problem
@_date: 2016-06-13 04:21:42
ya thats the other issue is that he isnt even using the term goxed correctly.
@_date: 2016-06-14 00:53:31
didnt read, junseth and his friend chris are both anti bitcoin, pro state. hope they sell their coins and get the fuck out sooner than later.
@_date: 2016-06-11 10:27:25
Electrum is a great desktop wallet. Make sure you use a password though! Post your receiving address if you know how.

super easy, just put "bitcoin donations : (receiving address here)"  on your overlay
@_date: 2016-06-16 04:39:12
no i love it i think its great. I would love to see 100b by the end of the year
@_date: 2016-06-13 00:21:09
they cant fake either volume or price
@_date: 2016-06-16 21:47:07
 you know what dude, you should take your "g". you should sell now.
@_date: 2016-06-13 00:22:49
again its only a 10b market cap... when the market cap gets to 100b, they might consider something
@_date: 2016-06-14 23:28:36
rofl epic comment. id say before 2019
@_date: 2016-06-23 02:33:51
hes worried about 200 lol
@_date: 2016-06-19 03:14:28
@_date: 2016-06-17 21:26:35
BIG thanks to the devs. there was alot of pressure to raise the block size, and you guys resisted it. It was the correct decision.
In april and may, during the night hours for US, unconfirmed tx's would sometimes fall below 1000. and during the day they would be under 5000 often, and it was fine no problems. You guys do great work and we are lucky to have such a good team of devs working on it. thanks guys!
@_date: 2016-06-03 21:02:45
thanks guys

epic SO epic what a find
@_date: 2017-01-22 19:16:42
Indeed, indeed. Its odd how bitcoin is a mix of people who know that there is a banking conspiracy, and mainstream people and few leftists even.
of course the banks will never want blockchain because it will stop them from manipulations and flat out theft.
@_date: 2016-06-27 04:33:17
agree with everything you said, other than the last point.
@_date: 2016-01-21 23:57:05
for SO MANY REASONS. russia currency collapsing, they are a national government, and btc is doing better with no backing. our detractors always say there is nothing backing btc! but they are wrong! the worlds largest computer network backs BTC!
@_date: 2017-01-09 12:11:51
For this to be true we need the coin etf to be approved
@_date: 2016-06-14 05:55:49
great question. but, last crash was caused mostly by the gox crash. bitcoin is a much better tested system and has a better, more decentralized set of exchanges around it. I think the next pullback will not be as dramatic as the 2014 pullback
@_date: 2016-06-14 05:45:58
@_date: 2016-06-07 08:43:21
yea, electrum
@_date: 2017-01-26 23:32:09
actually its fallen to about 15 cents
@_date: 2016-06-16 20:06:45
love this comment, so true, the people wishing for change dont really know what all comes with what they are wishing for.
@_date: 2017-01-02 08:42:07
for many many reasons, but a) because it works, and b) because there is limited supply, now and forever so people are starting to realize that, in comparison with paper or fiat money, is one of the main reasons it has value.
So the price rise is because people are getting in, while they still can.
@_date: 2017-01-23 01:45:24

mostly didnt, btc had a big rise to 690 hours before it was announced, last thursday night. then for the last week it traded down to 640, not much impact at all.

@_date: 2017-01-26 23:05:16
I falkvinge but i am disapointed that he points out the recent tx backlog(spam attack), which as i type this has disappeared. he is out of touch with reality.
@_date: 2016-06-16 20:05:39
ok well we have alot of haters and buttcoiners who have been hating since the price was 200. all they can do now is downvote, and best believe they do
@_date: 2016-06-20 04:41:49
Your big problem is that you dont have any. If already had some, i could say that you could wait if you wanted to. Since you have none, you have to bite the bullet and pay the spot price asap. because you are risking so much by not owning any, it could be 50- 100 dollar up days before summers end, and your risking missing on another 300-1000%
@_date: 2017-01-26 23:06:39
bitcoin has not hit capacity ceiling, as we speak the mempool is 10k
@_date: 2016-06-14 08:43:29
ok great they support the drug markets. great, they also support the federal reserve's money printing monopoly, they support the US stock markets and they think being you own bank is a shit idea. Why they bother with bitcoin, i dont know.
@_date: 2017-01-05 17:46:01
@_date: 2016-06-16 20:44:50
yeah, im always shocked when i hear people say they passed up on 200 dollar bitcoin. its a tough one. its headed to the moon though, so yeah you should still buy even if its expensive
@_date: 2016-06-30 01:30:14
its about done consolidating, heading higher or much higher tomorrow and this weekend
@_date: 2017-01-25 18:01:59
doesnt matter, isreal is a small country and not a player in the bitcoin market anyway

true, good post good questions
@_date: 2016-06-29 03:54:39
nah, its clear from the whitepaper it was an average citizen who was sick of seeing the 08 bank bailouts, and sick of credit card chargebacks. it was a 1 person, human.
@_date: 2017-01-09 12:11:34
dumb comment, how is that a "flaw"
@_date: 2016-11-22 22:36:28
yeah its fine, this happened about a month ago as well, just happens sometimes. all hes doing is donating money to miners, and with the increase in the hashrate recently, the miners are going to chew through this backlog with no issue. 
@_date: 2016-12-03 02:49:52
also, there was no better alternative as well.
@_date: 2017-01-30 19:41:54
rofl , the black girl came to the camera, and forgot what the chant was!! rofl
@_date: 2016-11-29 02:09:45
that wasnt the point, u can have btc and still be a dumbass, dead wrong troll
@_date: 2016-11-26 05:52:32
so why are u commenting on a bitcoin subreddit then?
@_date: 2017-01-02 10:33:23
litecoin is so through. the main problem is it always sells off when btc sells off, and it only sometimes rallys when btc rallys
@_date: 2016-12-19 02:46:14
not sure, the scaling problem... could be a big problem. if we a see a hardfork, price could collapse. 
I want to believe in fomo but im just not sure anymore
@_date: 2016-11-11 01:22:57
i believe that, i totally believe that
@_date: 2016-11-28 00:07:26
yeah, hes flat out wrong
@_date: 2016-12-02 02:22:00
but can they defeat their arch nemesis, jstolfi, rofl
@_date: 2016-12-02 02:11:30
rofl, nice lies
@_date: 2016-11-01 11:13:45
Yeah there will be a strong correction, for eth!
@_date: 2016-11-24 22:45:52
never seen a guy be as blatantly wrong as schiff, going back to 2008
@_date: 2016-11-27 09:30:16
yes this is basically everyone who has a negative comment
@_date: 2016-11-30 08:57:33

@_date: 2016-11-26 05:53:14
@_date: 2016-11-03 11:06:15
I wouldnt say they have a great sense of humor as much as they are just bitter they missed the breakout.
@_date: 2016-12-01 22:14:28
yes you should, better buy soon before the handle completes and moves to the target around 950
@_date: 2016-11-30 01:58:50
no reason to yet, wait till the price hit 10k
@_date: 2016-12-02 09:48:36
and its already been cut down by 38%. stop freaking out everytime theres a backlog
@_date: 2016-11-25 23:49:26
also most of the time the blocks arent full, only when there are these attacks. most of the time the unconfirm tx's are under 3k
@_date: 2016-12-22 08:43:24
theyre going to cancel your order xd
@_date: 2016-12-03 23:33:50
yeah, its ok
@_date: 2016-11-24 03:22:53
yeah what pb1x said. if a tx fee is too low, it stays in the mempool for 2-3 weeks then it is dropped. we have seen instances of this, where there are 15k+ unconfirmed tx's, but the average tx fee wasnt pushed up at all. so there is kind of no point to the attack youre talking about.
@_date: 2016-11-02 05:12:01
bitcoin is divisible so buy a $50 dollar giftcard thing for libertyx and get u some btc already.
@_date: 2016-12-01 00:13:33
Bitcoin is too small for him to worry about , 12 billion. I dont see any govt worrying about bitcoin until it reaches 500 billion market cap
@_date: 2016-12-26 05:31:51
I have amazing advice for you.
use libertyx.com its super easy and safe. i have bought atleast $1200 from them, they never have cheated me and they always immediatly send out the btc to your wallet.
just find a location, go in and get a 50 dollar pin number, and log on and type it in, get your bitcoin. only like 3-5% fee as well. great service
@_date: 2016-12-21 03:54:29

thanks, yeah I have been thinking about this. If a group of miners is deadset enough on it, they can fork the coin
@_date: 2016-11-14 06:20:18
Love it, absolutely agree. thanks for posting
@_date: 2016-12-18 00:34:45
these asain miners really do need to be careful, they are going to kill their golden goose then their mining equipment will be much less profitable
@_date: 2016-12-24 03:21:48
nice post, they are so fucking defeated. jstolfi thinks everyone bought @ 1200 even though it was only at 1200 for a day rofl. 
when the price goes through 1200, he will have no argument left
@_date: 2016-12-06 23:16:18
I agree with this post, there is alot of trolling. i suspect its btc'ers trying to increase pressure for scaling. they often wont post tx id's as well
@_date: 2016-12-28 08:09:06
too soon for posts like this, wait till we hit atleast between 750 billion - 1 trillion market cap
@_date: 2016-11-11 01:22:38
why do u want to sell so soon?

Yeah, dont send anymore btc to wikileaks until we can confirm hes alive and in control of his operation
@_date: 2016-12-14 00:23:01
we dont want to be regulated, regulated is worse, they can naked short sell regulated markets! cant do that on btc exchange
@_date: 2016-12-25 21:54:33
yeah ive said it before half the people @ r btc are paid shills
@_date: 2016-12-04 03:24:33
yeah, its actually not at its limits, the utx pool is back down to 2500. chewed through 2 60k backlogs recently no problem. people like yourself are under-estimating the current system's capacity.

ROFL, money. these attacks are expensive, and they are even more expensive when the hashrate has doubled in the last 2 months. miners are loving this
@_date: 2016-11-10 03:51:40
you guys arent agents you just really believe in the NWO and you wish they would just have currency transparency so crypto would just go away.
@_date: 2016-11-01 11:12:19
what are they trolling? why would they bother with a new 1 pound coin?
@_date: 2016-11-25 23:46:15
well youd be wrong, rofl, let me tell you, me and every holder would take that price, laugh all the way to the bank, and not give 2 fucks if haters didnt think it was a success
@_date: 2016-11-29 02:10:23
whoa slow down there speed racer, well see if their quantum computers ever work.
@_date: 2016-12-25 23:26:07
well they cant do much else, thats the nice thing about bitcoin, the attackers cant attack anything but the community
@_date: 2016-12-22 08:44:13
I dont know, Its a legal market im sure so it doesnt really matter. i might also be wrong about that, i dont know
@_date: 2016-12-03 02:49:23
One thing that hasnt been mentioned, also the US forced other smaller countries to buy US bonds through negotiation. that supports that dollar as well, almost every country we deal with has US bonds in their portfolio.
@_date: 2016-11-24 09:44:07
OUCH REALLY ...
however i think you will be fine and the tx will process, may take up to 2-3 weeks, or less
@_date: 2016-12-19 11:20:00
really i mean im talking about a potentially realistic scenario
@_date: 2016-11-27 10:47:27
It really depends on your situation. If you own no bitcoin, you have a buy a significant amount asap because of the risk of the price moving up 100 dollars tomorrow. 
buying the dips is always good. I have bought on every  big down day this year. if its down 25 dollars+, thats ideal. I also buy whenever I want to.
Its better to buy in bigger chunks though so you get hit less by the fees. unless your paying a pure % fee, then it doesnt matter
again, what you dont want to do is be the guy whos waiting for a major pullback to buy. not gonna happen.
I remember, over a year ago now in october when the price went to 250, alot of people sold expecting to be able to buy back at 200, it never happened and they were forced to fomo back in on the pump to 440.
@_date: 2016-12-27 12:24:16
it would almost have to be roger ver or the winklevoss twins or some other like large holder with atleast .025% of all coins to have the stake to want to actually fund marketing

700 is a high price and is a success in my opinion. thats an 11 billion dollar market cap. 11 billion. thats outside of the bankers control/govt control.
even a super rich person who needed to make a 30 million dollar transaction, could use bitcoin to do it. its that big.
that being said, 11 billion is still a small amount to the gov's of the world especially usa and china

@_date: 2016-11-16 03:35:01
Agree totally, great post. I use btc a fair amount and I have rarely had a problem, and once you get a tx stuck, you learn from that and learn to check your fee before you send.
Its awesome how fast btc works, and I think anyone who complains its slow and clogged up, is most likely a troll. Even when TX backlog spiked to 50k a month or so ago, I could still send tx's over all that backlog, which was cleaned out by miner within 36 hours.
@_date: 2016-12-21 06:06:47
yeah its hard to find info about derivatives. from what i understand, they are products that they sell each other, like the average investor cant even buy them because they only sell them to each other.
@_date: 2017-01-25 18:15:38
yeah its mostly hype, what have they actually done?
@_date: 2016-12-01 07:54:22
if its not yours, i dont think so, but i dont know so
@_date: 2016-12-27 10:25:26
I agree with you bitcoin does need better marketing.
the problem though is that requires actual work, and no one here is getting paid to do it.
@_date: 2016-11-27 10:42:23
actually good point
@_date: 2016-12-18 00:50:37
It could happen, there are alot of concerns. it looks like segwit wont be activated, and it is going to fork into 2 currencies.
@_date: 2016-12-24 03:18:57
nice, thats an epic pic
@_date: 2016-12-02 18:13:20
great post, i agree. people just dont get it, bitcoin is already a success.
I was arguing this point on buttcoin or btc (samething) the other day, that bitcoin is already a success. they said even if bitcoin went to 100k per coin it wouldnt be a success?? fucking morons, great post!!
@_date: 2016-11-26 05:52:03

interesting that you got hacked the same day bitfinex did.
you will never get the .55 back.

@_date: 2016-11-25 14:20:16
at this point hes so invested in bitcoin failing, it has to be frustrating for him to watch the price keep rising. I think hes all in now, hes spent too much time, he cant stop trying now, rofl!

Nothing you can do man, just wasting your time. there will not be any evidence.
@_date: 2016-09-01 08:13:51
second this segwit combined with the price halvening, it will look good.
@_date: 2016-09-25 23:27:56
this post is a bit of a back handed compliment, the small blockers were proven correct over time, let the devs handle scaling, segwit will be here soon
@_date: 2016-09-01 05:42:35
good post, they do so much small shit that doesnt get viewed by the community, and certainly gets disrespected by all at @_date: 2016-09-16 02:18:45

Thank you core devs for your hard work!
@_date: 2016-09-01 05:40:23
well, for it to fall below 440 now, we would need the program to break and the price to go to 0. 440 is the stone cold bottom, we will never see prices from the 2015 lows again. there were SO many people that sold at 250, 275, 300, 320, 340, thinking it would go down and they could buy back in. most likely, all of them bought back in much higher. so saying the 2015 lows is somehow possible is wishful thinking, at best. there are many people would who would love to buy at 500, 480, 460. much more likely is a test of the ATH again.
@_date: 2016-09-30 20:06:56
in all fairness its down 80% from its ath
@_date: 2016-09-01 08:13:18
ya i mean it was such a strong resistance point for a long time, then since broken it was strong support.
@_date: 2015-09-30 00:22:56
ya its not a good site, they require WAY to much proof to start a new loan, so its because the site is restriciting who can apply for loans
@_date: 2016-10-21 22:13:04
was it encrypted? did you have a password on your wallet?
@_date: 2016-10-19 21:03:33
yep. good post, r btc is a combination of ethereum holders, who have used that forum to proclaim bitcoin as dead for the past year, and also moles and paid shills. 
@_date: 2016-10-11 19:21:37
not really, you have a small handful of people, some of which are CIA paid agents to create inner turmoil being vocal, almost everyone likes it, lets not forget it fixes tx malleability along with other issues.
@_date: 2016-10-22 21:44:23
he seems to not want to answer this question, but almost always in these situations where coins are moved off an individuals device, they didnt have a password on their wallet.
@_date: 2016-10-15 23:40:08
of course you say all that without mentioning the political risk of the hardfork
@_date: 2016-10-13 00:10:42
we will see if their quantum computers even work
@_date: 2016-10-08 01:24:27
I dont think BU can fork it, only bitcoin core devs will be trusted with a fork
but its no issue, youll have your coins on both networks, eventually one fork will be the clear winner and we will see people dumping coins on the smaller mkt cap fork. just like we saw with eth. no issue @ end of day. 
@_date: 2016-10-27 23:02:40
thats fucking amazing, just like i always said, bitcoin always chews through the mempool and seeing unconfirm tx buildup is never an issue
@_date: 2016-10-22 21:45:59
I dont think they even had to bruteforce the password, just get the wallet file
@_date: 2016-10-27 23:18:11
yeah, that happens sometimes, no issue
@_date: 2016-10-20 22:32:49
right. well they have a monopoly on banking, they can exclude whomever they please. so enforcement should be easy.
@_date: 2016-10-15 20:28:07
well remember other btc communities have all the paid shills, and cia agents. they are rife with moles. No matter how efficient the solution, they wont be happy with it because they want to destabilize bitcoin and see the price drop. 
@_date: 2016-10-29 02:54:50
actually blocks arent full
@_date: 2016-10-23 00:51:06
wallet files CAN be encypted w/ a password but dont have to be.
@_date: 2016-10-12 21:57:08
no its not, i wish u guys would just crawl back into your shit hole and stop spamming the forum, well start with segwit and schnorr and see where we go from there. have patience, the network is not clogged up and has been working fine this whole entire time. 
@_date: 2016-10-29 02:55:49
why the f would you sell right now?
@_date: 2016-10-10 21:37:52
yeah, we just had a difficulty increase. I think the big blockers are taking this oppurtunity to attack. adjust tx fees appropriately! segwit just around the corner
@_date: 2016-10-10 22:10:21
good to know, that makes sense
@_date: 2016-10-07 02:59:03
It does matter in the sense that btc'ers want to carry out his vision and are inspired by his ideals.
@_date: 2016-10-14 01:29:32
people who arent core contributors are trying to hard fork bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-29 23:31:08
what do u mean five years later? rofl its not even three years later.
Youre a bit deluded, adoption takes time, who cares about missed oppurtunitys, those business are going to be the ones staring at their own missed oppurtunity. I know we were at 780, big deal?? who cares
ya u get a downvote guy, sell your coins already
@_date: 2016-10-30 02:31:30
yeah agree, 80 million + currency units, and vitalik claims to be a fan of austrian economics. doesnt make sense
@_date: 2016-10-19 11:46:54
true his calculations are off
@_date: 2016-10-14 01:44:01
i would take it and put it in btc for sure, I wouldnt wait long to do it either or you might be looking at affording alot less btc for 17k
@_date: 2016-10-26 20:41:02
ffs people, hold onto your shit. if you have to make a tx right now, be safe and use atleast .0006 fee. btc always chews through the mempool and it will do it again. this happens from time to time, it will be ok. waiting a few hours is still better than a bank transfer wait a few days.
@_date: 2015-11-24 05:45:31
addtionally, if you look at gold's 7 trillion dollar market cap, gold still sees alot of volatility as well even though its such a massive market. 
@_date: 2016-10-10 20:08:29
hopefully none, 12% is nothing and they are throwing away money because they arent mining on the main chain. well see how long they want to throw away money.
@_date: 2016-10-20 22:37:19
alot of what your saying doenst matter. some old womans opinion doesn't mean its fact. You know what im saying is true, so does most of the community, who cares how it makes us look. Its the truth, and calling them out for what they are is what we should be doing
@_date: 2016-10-08 09:15:18
well hal finney is dead, the rest are... i mean its a high risk endeavor in a sense
@_date: 2015-11-20 00:48:13
but you cant fund it with btc, only with coinbase, not really a btc debit card 
@_date: 2016-10-19 20:50:48
not really, most of r btc are ethereum holders, so they want to see bitcoin fail. so they dont have the same financial incentive that we do
@_date: 2015-11-22 00:19:04
bitcoin doesnt have to be mass accepted, and achieving legitimacy is not our goal. many mainstreamers will never accept it as legitimate and we're ok with that. if btc captures 1% of the global gold market, its goes to 15k per coin. we use it to hold money and to send money and to recieve money.
@_date: 2015-11-03 04:05:20
are you even serious? you sold at 250?.... 
@_date: 2015-11-15 21:46:31
I disagree. this post is pure speculation, first of all, walmart doesnt accept bitcoin and most likely will not in the near future. second of all, US govt doesnt have a blacklist. this post is just wrong, and bitcoin IS fungible.
@_date: 2015-11-03 04:07:20
yeah this 40% gain isnt a bubble.... at 370 already calling bubble?? after an established triple bottom?. maybe, hey i hope it does go back down to 300 and under but i dont think it will
@_date: 2016-10-08 09:16:01
what kinda retarded question is this?
@_date: 2016-10-11 19:21:43
ya. exactly
@_date: 2016-10-22 21:49:34
 yeah more likely its a yuan lead situation but, who knows maybe the paypal event added a couple 100k to btc market share
@_date: 2016-10-27 06:26:08
well your opinion sir, is wrong. those are like small side reasons why btc is better than fiat, there are atleast 5 more relevant reasons
@_date: 2015-11-21 22:01:05
This post is COMPLETE bullshit. they make you take a pic of your id, holding it next to your face. you cant just upload any ID. complete BS, bad post
@_date: 2016-10-22 00:19:43
its always the case, in these situations where an individual loses bitcoin off his device, that he had no password on this wallet. very sorry for your loss, an expensive lesson. Always have a password on your wallet.
If you had a backup wallet.dat file anywhere saved on your machine, a hacker can just download ur wallet file, and move your coins no problem because you have no password.

Doesnt have alot of room to move down, really. The last few weeks has shown that once the demand starts to heat up, the supply can easily start to run out. by the time july hits and the halving comes, there is potential to skyrocket. others have said new ATH, i think that is possible. 
@_date: 2015-10-15 21:56:56
ya its a really stupid comment from him, it is vague and doesnt have any real meaning, but its a feel good comment that he thinks will get him support. what a toolbag
@_date: 2016-05-29 22:46:15
she can try but it probably wont affect the price
@_date: 2016-05-30 08:37:16
ya know I doubt they will listen.
@_date: 2015-11-24 05:44:23
if you read the whitepaper, and look at his postings, satoshi intended that instead of having the supply change, he would have a fixed supply and let the price fluctuate up and down. so the idea was that there is always going to be some inherent volatility. This is an issue people talk alot about and probably i should make a bigger post about it but. Its going to take a lot of users before it sees less volatility. thats how it was designed, if you dont like that maybe btc isnt for you. like i said, many mainstreamers will never adopt btc.
@_date: 2016-05-30 04:35:52
Agree, the Redfel guy is dead wrong, bitcoin fundamentals are strong and the price move is logical.
@_date: 2016-10-19 21:09:20
I think it will die down though, when all things considered, letting the miners choose the block size is bad and will lead to centralization, much more so than weve already seen.
@_date: 2016-05-30 06:05:40

@_date: 2016-05-30 06:08:45
So that the inflation reduces over time and increases stability over time. IF all coins were evenly distributed and there were no halvings, it would be harder for that coin to get off the ground, and it would face more inflation in the more established later phase of the coin, which is not what we want.

Yeah, you cant do that. Its good to send a tx every couple of months just to remind yourself
@_date: 2016-05-29 23:04:38
Buttcoiners, take a minute to read this and you might understand dollar cost average. oh wait, that subreddit is dead
@_date: 2016-05-31 22:27:36
rofl, what are we better off with a dollar system that benefits a few insiders? 
@_date: 2016-05-31 22:28:38
not possible
@_date: 2016-05-30 08:45:40
nice article and analysis, please continue to post your articles.
@_date: 2016-05-30 04:33:38
I think the bubble word tossing is from people who were banking on a price drop, so they can buy lower.
they missed their chance to buy now they are trying ( in vein) to manipulate.
@_date: 2016-05-30 06:36:47
as long as you have some level of GDP or standard of living thats above 0, money printing is a powerful tool for the government.  IF you were correct, zimbabwe and venezuala would stop inflating, but they dont because it gives them power. as long as the citizens of the country have to use the government endorsed currency by law, the state gains power from money printing.

wrong subreddit, check out @_date: 2016-05-30 08:46:57
est 2 mill coins lost to date ( including satoshis )
@_date: 2015-10-15 05:12:51
I agree with alot of the commenters. the interesting thing to me is the question: Who is a bigger bitcoin supporter? The average american who has next to no clue what bitcoin is? or the average buttcoiner? I think buttcoiners are bigger supporters than the average american, and some buttcoiners actually do own some bitcoin. so theres that.
@_date: 2015-10-14 02:07:12
This is great, I totally agree. There is alot of trolling here, mostly from buttcoiners. regardless of what side of the block size debate you are on, we can agree that trolls love to post here. sometimes their trolling is very sublte, sometimes its very blatant but i think its worth it to keep banning these types, both subtle and obvious. make them keep making new accounts, its fine.
@_date: 2015-10-25 22:55:55
yeah you kinda missed the run up by about 2 - 3 weeks if not 2 months. but if it goes to 310, youll be wishing you bought today.
@_date: 2016-05-28 21:29:16
ya fucking right whose gonna spend their BTC right now? maybe re issue this in september
@_date: 2016-05-31 01:06:54
dont bother just buy coins
@_date: 2015-10-14 02:10:19
wrong their are no restaurants that accept sex as payment.
@_date: 2016-05-30 08:36:29
Yeah, either way their power to print will be undermined by bitcoin, thats why im issueing them this warning, so they can help themselves before its too late.
@_date: 2016-05-14 16:59:31
Yeah its a good call, we may see a price jump any day, and by the end of 2017, we are looking at atleast 1k per btc
@_date: 2016-05-29 08:37:38
go back to buttcoin, oh wait that subreddit is totally dead
@_date: 2016-05-30 06:05:24
Ok just cause youre a bad trader doesnt invalidate this claim
@_date: 2016-07-23 07:27:13
yeah like you cant be that dumb, that ones on you and him. use a better mobile wallet, also if a moron is operating a food truck, might want to think twice.
atleast get a mobile wallet app that can give u some information when you send a transaction
also when he mentions he lost money because he didnt sell at the top, rofl what a joke. i would have lambasted him then and there and told him that he needs to be a trader if we wants to take advantage of volatility
@_date: 2016-07-18 23:24:02
well im already educated on it, like i said earlier, bitcoin has given us more info than some guy who speculated on it
@_date: 2016-07-18 22:54:23
thats not an argument guy. we believe bitcoin is ideal money, and we are putting our money where our mouth is. what about you?
honestly, piss off and go to r/btc or r/buttcoin, i dont think youre a bitcoiner
@_date: 2016-07-23 07:42:02
Weve heard nothing bad about the BTC debit cards so far.
No issues with using Btc as a currency.
web based wallets are less secure, but generally still are secure and we rarely hear about coins being stolen nowadays.
wallet security is a big issue i could write 4 pages on it. in general, keep it on a computer that is safe and have a very strong password.
most the big services that are still around are trustworthy. a few people have posted about problems with coinbase
@_date: 2016-07-02 03:06:50
the charges were from shit country, not usa
@_date: 2016-07-27 01:31:19
well i think you have to put your cell num in but other than that, no
@_date: 2016-07-19 01:20:54
ive read the bitcoin whitepaper, i read all the time, John nash arguments add nothing to the discussion! for the last time, go start your own altcoin! ffs, no one here agrees with you, we think bitcoin is ideal money, and satoshi has better understanding of this issue than mr. nash
@_date: 2016-07-23 19:53:53
well i didnt mean his profession is bad. I said if a MORON is operating a food truck. So clearly, based on the guys comments , saying that he "lost money" on bitcoin, the food truck operator is stupid. food trucks are ok, when the operator is a dumbass who accepts bitcoin, you might have an issue
@_date: 2016-07-18 22:56:23
thats your opinion kid, not a fact. go start nash coin if you really believe in what youre saying. ive dont know who nash is, nor do i care, bitcoin has already been created, we are past that.
@_date: 2016-07-03 00:14:37
Yeah it really is a shame that HAObtc cant show a little bit of patience because the scaling solutions the core team have lined up will solve scaling issues for atleast a decade
@_date: 2016-07-26 14:45:14
in all fairness, its good for bitcoin if etc goes up, and its really bad for eth. so its all good
@_date: 2016-07-02 23:18:01
you want 1 dollar? lol
@_date: 2016-07-18 23:24:55
well he is a real person, who used a pseudonym 
@_date: 2016-07-02 02:47:00
well there was one guy last weekend who was defending the 14 dollar price, who knows how many millions he spent doing that, he must have been a huge bag holder. it still didnt hold, now it looks like a new person or group is defending 12 dollars. pretty interesting to watch really.
@_date: 2016-07-02 03:46:16
well if you read the whitepaper, you can atleast see his motives. he was sick of governments bailing out failed institutions, and had libertarian leanings
@_date: 2016-07-02 02:51:15
yeah, really enjoyed this read.
@_date: 2016-07-03 23:18:11
sure bud, pretend youre not getting creamed

im not sure that you can, prepaid is often rejected, but try paxful
@_date: 2016-07-26 14:46:16
This is awesome, if you want to stick it to the eth people , go buy a little etc, rofl
@_date: 2016-07-18 23:03:43
great comment, great response. I have to assume if whoever this nash fellow is, if he really believes in ideal money, then he probably supports bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-21 21:02:51
why is this on bitcoin subreddit??
@_date: 2016-07-02 19:16:13
actually forking is bad for them, and will cost the coin any credibility it had, regardless if youre honest or dishonest
@_date: 2016-07-23 19:51:36
if hes that much of an idiot, the re using the same code is better because it saves time
@_date: 2016-07-02 02:49:26
theres alot of reasons not too lol, what if a criminal breaks into vitaliks apartment, puts a gun to his head and says fork it or your dead? or the gov does the same? lol. 
also the project will lose all credibility if they do, they are better off letting the hacker keep the eth.
@_date: 2016-07-26 15:04:52
that would be epic but the new world order would probably bomb us. If trump gets elected, and europe moves to the far right, maybe in a decade from now it will be a safer move.
@_date: 2016-07-03 01:11:53
crank it up to 50 and go to libertyx.com easy peasy
@_date: 2016-07-18 22:17:39
ya that is kind of my point, that chart you see when you come to r bitcoin through mobile , describes the characteristics of money, and compares btc to fiat to gold, and btc is the best
@_date: 2016-07-01 19:42:06
@_date: 2016-07-03 02:51:13
hahaha, going back to 420 is it? this guy is comedy gold
@_date: 2016-07-25 08:39:54
ya i suspected that, you dont have any significant stake, and your subtly trolling. ill respond to you when you join the 21 mill club.

i hope its ethc

shes not pro bitcoin, shes trying to say leaving the EU was bad. shes a huge leftist cunt

also not anyone can be a citizen, gotta have some BTC to be a citizen
@_date: 2016-07-18 23:09:18
yet to be determined

check out xotica.tv, its a cam site where u can get paid in bitcoins. show your butthole and see what u get
@_date: 2016-07-02 03:00:14
its beyond my understanding, but peter todd said recently that a turing machine doesnt exist in the real world.
@_date: 2016-07-26 15:00:28
its so true good comment
@_date: 2016-07-02 19:15:27
youre a bit delusional
@_date: 2016-07-02 02:48:13
good point, we actually dont know if smart contracts can even be possible yet, maybe but it doesnt look good so far.
@_date: 2016-07-03 02:30:41
fair enough i never said it was offensive, but it clearly showed he is running thin on patience.
@_date: 2016-07-03 00:48:53
him too but hao posted a blog, it was on front page like 3 days ago
@_date: 2016-07-27 07:37:08
Well the thing is, the btc core devs didnt really need to learn from this, they knew a year ago the danger of a hard fork, despite alot of community pressure they kept their cool and made the right decisions. we can confirm they were right , now though.
@_date: 2016-07-27 00:02:17
thumbs up rofl, btc'ers are having a fucking laugh today
@_date: 2016-07-18 23:01:57
last thing ill say to you, the 6+ years of bitcoin real life experiment is more valueable and provides us with more information than some guy who has speculated about what ideal money is for 20 years, without doing any experiments on it.
@_date: 2016-07-03 01:17:40
yeah it will dip after it hits 2400-3400
@_date: 2016-07-03 02:48:19
hows your shorts going?
@_date: 2016-07-01 00:42:21
....  we think its gonna succeed, alot of impatient people have already switched to ether. no one knows, only time will tell
@_date: 2016-07-05 07:08:27
lol. Yeah I agree in a macro sense that global instability should only help btc. and maybe it has, and ive under estimated it. Im looking for more confirmation, I want to see a 10% drop in any fiat currency, and a sizeable gain in btc maybe the same day or a few days after. then I would be more comfortable with the article writers claims.
@_date: 2016-07-25 08:26:22
I forget the guy who posted on twitter but he nailed it. keep the course, core devs. if bitcoin was easy to change, it would already be dead!
@_date: 2016-07-22 04:59:52
its a bug
@_date: 2016-07-04 22:33:55
yeah i think you must be new here, the 1k spike was in dec 2013 and the greek crisis was toward the middle of 2015 so... ya
@_date: 2016-07-25 07:01:59
he got pulled into eth during the eth run up in the early part of the year, he thought the block size was going to be an issue, and he left his position in bitcoin, so he missed alot of the run up after feb of this year. he got creamed on the doa hack and his net worth got cut in half, he is all in on eth now and he needs the price to recover so he like all these eth guys , is in full pump mode.
@_date: 2016-07-18 23:18:18
first of all thats your opinion, thats subjective. second of all, thats great and im happy for him and if he helped influence bitcoin then thats great, however many people contributed and had ideas about bitcoin, check out the cypherpunks if you want to know more. it  was the genius of satoshi that blessed us with bitcoin, however. many people tried to create versions of bitcoin, but satoshi was actually able to do it, and the first to solve the byzantine generals problem. so technically satoshi is smarter than nash.
@_date: 2016-07-25 08:25:39
great post, agree totally. there are lots of trolls, some blatant, some more subtle, and they all rally around this really dangerous and risky idea of a hardfork. with eth right now, we are seeing how risky hard forks are. I have so much respect for the core devs and their ability to resist the 2mb hard fork, great post!
@_date: 2016-07-02 19:17:29
not in this sub, maybe in the ethtrader sub
@_date: 2016-07-25 08:34:00
dude you always want to talk about the most irrelevant topics. do you even own any bitcoin? and how much?
@_date: 2016-07-18 22:13:38
well, bitcoin is ideal money. i mean, thats what the whole forum and idea and bitcoin program is all about. its kind of already assumed everyone knows about this, on mobile when you come here, they have the chart of properties of money, its the first thing visitors see. so im not sure what your point is here.
@_date: 2016-07-17 21:57:11
bitcoin is monetary reform
@_date: 2016-07-23 07:31:18
agree food truck guy should have his qr code like printed and on the side of the truck to save time. sounds like a complete moron
@_date: 2016-07-27 00:03:10
It could happen to bitcoin but thankfully we have been blessed with some next next level godly core devs and they prevented it from happening
@_date: 2016-07-23 19:54:43
well it is a really annoying comment because, heres a guy who accepts bitcoin, yet wants to cry about accepting bitcoin. what a toolbag.
@_date: 2016-05-31 22:30:47
Do they require ID information before you can cashout in BTC?
@_date: 2016-07-18 22:22:17
ok you think bitcoin isnt ideal money? i was wondering what you were getting at. i will tell you youre wrong and bitcoin IS ideal money. however, if you feel otherwise, go start your own altcoin guy! no reason to post here about how bitcoin isnt ideal, with no argument
@_date: 2016-07-24 21:00:56
How do we actually know that it was purchased from dark net? they said the same thing about the paris mass shooting, and it ended up not being true
@_date: 2016-07-03 23:19:16
not sure what you mean really
@_date: 2016-07-05 02:27:04
Yeah there was alot of speculation from, I would say dumbasses, although I like most of the btc community. the price of btc was around 350ish when the greek crisis happened, it maybe went up 20 dollars ? then came back down if i remember correct, it just didnt effect it much. and alot of dumbasses said greek crisis will push bitcoin higher! which it didnt.  Some bitcoiners want to use every small half crisis as an excuse of why the price went up, others are smarter and know that it was just the normal speculation and hodling.
Brexit is a perfect example of this. the brexit vote wasnt announced until friday morning, but thursday night, BEFORE the vote was announced, the price went from 630 to 690. then, friday morning when the brexit result was announced, btc traded sideways for a while then went back down. So I dont think brexit had anything to do with it, alot of other people felt the same, that didnt stop people from writing articles claiming it did though. 
On one hand i can see why BTC'ers do this because they want any excsue to pump the price, which is actaully fine with me but i guess i have a preference for being correct and accurate.
@_date: 2016-07-05 02:35:34
actually that was a Ford quote, its just that the left lies about history and stuff trying to protect their system
@_date: 2016-07-27 01:33:28
you cant from trezor lol but i doubt u lost monero key and trying to scam shapeshift, but its all good i dont care
@_date: 2016-07-18 23:08:22
 honestly because i dont have to guy. i understand you like and agree with this guy, and maybe want to promote him, but if he believes in ideal money, then bitcoin is here, its already been created.
