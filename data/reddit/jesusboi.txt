''Don't worry, if I win this, I'll continue.
I traded in the open, possibly this is why I am getting the attention I get now. However my feeling is that if people know me, know who I am and I put my reputation on the line, it creates a safer environment to do a trade than with some anonymous person. This is what I want to continue doing.''

''it's not a tax issue, I pay taxes on any profits. It's purely about the trading of Bitcoins.''

My limit is 500 € per day, these days, but that's still way under the money laundering limits. Besides it's not really an exchange anyway, the site only tells the price at which I buy or sell and gives an e-mail address to contact me. It's exactly the same as people trading on localbitcoins or OTC, except that I have my own webpage. So is it illegal to have your own personal webpage for Bitcoins in Estonia?

I'll publish as much detail as I can soon. For now let me say that I have been threatened with a 32000 Euro fine and 3 years in jail.
