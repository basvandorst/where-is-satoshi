Those that can avoid passivity, apathy, consumerism as a lifestyle/main life goal, and hatred of poor and disenfranchised people will be the only ones left to contemplate what can be done about the popular culture/mindset the powerful have created.
The rest, without incentive to change, will do nothing to oppose the fascist feature creep in government that is currently happening.

Hey baby! Mining's not viable for regular Joes anymore. The reason is that new mining equipment is expensive and monopolized by companies with lots of money and cheap electricity. You literally can't compete anymore, and even if you find a machine that advertises decent speeds for a small fortune - there is no telling when you will receive that machine. In all likelihood, that machine won't be fast enough to be worth it by the time you receive it. 
As for cloud mining, I believe it's a scam that works something like this: 
* You pay $100 for a mining contract. 
* The company says they are buying equipment with your cash, but in reality they just buy bitcoin with it. 
* Then they pay you out in bitcoin (obviously less that you paid in) and keep the difference to profit. 
If you want to invest $100 then just buy $100 worth of bitcoin - you will get more bitcoin for your money this way. If you just want a tech toy to play with then consider buying a $10 USB miner on ebay and run it solo - odds are you wont hit a block in your lifetime but if you do manage to hit the lottery you will have some coin and a great story; Plus you will be supporting the network.

Coinbase is all weird right now as well - buys and sells are stuck at 276/277 while the listed price is 272...
