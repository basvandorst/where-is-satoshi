Looks like they are working on a new blockchain, without necessarily relying on bitcoin.
Wall street seems to have decided to try to take advantage of the technology while owing the technology as well. That's direct competition to bitcoin and to bitcoin owners who hope the price will go up because wall street is going to buy it. They won't for now.

If you don't like my idea, what do you suggest instead?

Coinbase is probably burning a lot more cash compared to the revenues they have from collecting fees on bitcoin transactions.

No one knows yet what exactly bitcoin is and what it will become. But it's here to stay and evolve.

so far, bitcoin returns have very low correlation to stock market returns. therefore, given existing data it's hard to argue one way or another. but correlations could change
