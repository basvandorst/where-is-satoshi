Still got burned my the huge selloff though. Bitcoin was trading at around 650 now its at 570
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:07:50
Ha!  Exact same thing here.
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:12:39
@_date: 2016-08-10 15:03:14
So is there a winner?
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:49:48
Even if they got 75% back, you'd have to be insane to ever use that exchange again.
@_date: 2015-06-24 15:00:17
I think it averages 2000 and peaks at 4000, but that's beside the point. The point is tps doesn't necassarily determine value.
@_date: 2015-12-17 22:22:32
It's not the banks you should be worried about, it's the governments.
@_date: 2015-06-24 15:14:43
The bitcoin protocol was defiantly created with certain goals in mind. I don't know what Satoshi had in mind nor do I really care.

Have a blessed Christmas!
@_date: 2017-02-05 09:16:36
It's true. Everyone is so bullish, but I'm afraid arrogance, greed and obdurateness will harm bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-09 14:32:50
Couldn't agree more, my first thought was "Why is this coming out at night?"
@_date: 2017-02-07 16:19:48
It seems like this deadline is drawing more hype and media attention than previous deadlines. Is this the real deadline for a desicion? Or can the can just keep getting kicked down the road?
@_date: 2017-02-09 18:48:26
Good point
@_date: 2017-02-09 15:13:18
What exactly are they planning on upgrading? How do you prevent people from sending bitcoin overseas? 
@_date: 2017-02-06 02:12:30
Why is it when i restore the multibit wallet i need the words as well as the date stamp. I f i were to lose the date stamp is all lost?
@_date: 2017-02-27 02:11:02
You are the only person I've heard say that it wont be approved by default if no decsion is published / made? Are there any rules written to support what you are saying?

that makes sense thanks!

I am about sick of China. However, it looks like were going to settle about $70 lower, which is nothing. A year ago news like this would've tanked the price.

What about fiat on an exchange? Did people lose fiat on the bitfinex hack?
@_date: 2017-02-12 10:37:30
Dad? Is that you? I'd like them right now please.
@_date: 2017-02-28 12:56:58
Just to add to my post, in the last 24 hours bitfinex was the number 1 exchange in the world in terms of volume (15.4%) I seriously don't understand how so many people went back to them. Their CEO must be worth his weight in gold.
@_date: 2016-03-27 16:04:05
Not sure how it works in the Czech Republic, but in the US they sent a collection agency after me. I ignored their phone calls and they eventually went away.
@_date: 2017-02-28 14:21:49
Thanks. This answers my question.
@_date: 2016-03-27 15:59:24
Ive used paypal to sell btc. The trick is to quickly withdraw funds from your paypal account after a payment is received. So that when a buyer disputes a transaction (someone will), the money is gone. You will have a negative balance, and paypal will harass you to return the money, but you can ignore them. You'll be in the clear. Oh and you won't be able to use paypal again.
@_date: 2017-02-08 00:36:50
Reminds me the passage out of the bible in Revelations 13:16-17 
"It also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads, so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name."
Of course I don't understand everything in the book of Revelation, but the prophecy of people not being able to buy and sell sounds exactly like a government run cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-02-13 15:20:42
Bitcoin take my money!

@_date: 2017-03-17 19:14:52
Yeah that's true I saw they were trying to higher an algorithmic trader or whatever they called it a month or 2 ago

I know, it's insane. There have been news reports about a pre-emptive strikevby the US on N Korea. I can help but wonder if Koreans are buying crypto because theyre afraid of war. Hope that's not true
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:50:31
The only idea that will work is a hard fork. Like it or not, if the debate is ever to be solved, that's what needs to happen. And if it's going to happen we might as well do it and get it behind us. Cause I'm sick of it

I could probably change the car to a nice green color for you.
@_date: 2017-01-03 06:02:49
It's anyone's guess, I'd be afraid to do that though.
I have an account with coinbase. I'm really tempted to sell btc here and buy in the US. I just hate moving around coins and money for tax reasons, and I'm always afraid something will go wrong. I feel like coinbase will freeze my account or something stupid. I also dont like the fact that I have to wait a week to get the btc with coinbase. but the money is definitely there for the taking. 
@_date: 2017-01-03 05:21:17
It must be some rich dude buying it up. All I can think of. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 16:28:44
friggin hilarious
@_date: 2017-01-17 17:22:51
It does, but I like that I can lock in at a certain price.  Wish others sites would have that feature
@_date: 2017-01-30 13:18:11
Or, a great idea for a government keen on bitcoin's demise 
@_date: 2017-01-25 17:33:40
I guess it's nice when a gov tells you what you can and can't do. /s
@_date: 2017-01-03 03:53:37
It usually trades 20 - $50 above. its at 135 now... No idea
@_date: 2017-01-08 10:14:34
I know this isn't practicle but it'd be nice if we could do like a stock split and double everyone's btc. Now there are 42 million coins.
@_date: 2017-01-17 14:58:42
Anyway, nice to see other English speaking bitcoiners in S Korea. :)
@_date: 2017-01-17 11:23:47
I don't know, personally I love the volatility. It's great for trading and arbitrage, but I can see how some people don't like it.

The moon is when I can quit my job.
@_date: 2017-01-17 14:39:55
I guess this is cool to see, but I really don't understand the purpose.Who buys btc on an ATM?  is it just for anonymity? Why pay a markup when it's really simple to buy on an exchange in Korea?
@_date: 2017-01-17 16:09:27
POssibly, but in Korea it can easily be done in minutes with your phone, cost is about a dollar
@_date: 2017-01-03 09:54:12
Yeah I know... I'm siting here thinking the exact same thing. Should've pulled the trigger. In the 3-4 years I've been watching korbit I've never seen anything like this.
Yeah, I had no idea there were so many here in SK either. I'm always sad when there's a btc rally and I have no one to celebrate with.
@_date: 2017-01-23 14:15:18
Wow, such vitriol. I'm not saying it should or shouldn't be done, I am just promoting a healthy discussion. I'll tell you one reason why corporations do it. Because it is psychological. We all heard of people who say, " 1 bitcoin costs too much money, so I won't invest" Of course they can buy a fraction. Splitting the stock or coin makes it look more attractive I guess you could say. The bull headed people in this sub are hilarious. Anyway, have fun
@_date: 2017-01-14 02:43:24
I put a buy order in last week when the price was around $1100, a couple days later my account became restricted for some stupid reason. I thought to myself, well that would be great if they would cancel that order. Nope, they didn't. Seems like Coinbase only cancels orders when it is financially advantageous for them.  
@_date: 2017-01-23 13:33:50
Instead of just barking nonsense explain why this would be a terrible idea. I get the idea that hard forks generally want to be avoided. But if you could snap your fingers and it would be done, then explain why it would be bad.
@_date: 2017-01-25 15:52:50
As far as I'm concerned it sucks, not sure why everyone is celebrating it
@_date: 2017-01-02 10:00:52
Only bitcoin will be worth more.
@_date: 2017-01-02 11:10:53
Not sure what the date was, but upon further inspection it appears to be a loan certificate. So probably not worth all that much.
@_date: 2017-01-14 16:42:05
You don't need any files. You should be able to install multibit on another computer, select restore wallet, and you will be good to go
@_date: 2017-01-16 17:39:51
Probably those friggin robots are at it again
@_date: 2017-01-17 16:48:54
It is nice, wish i could do the same in the US
@_date: 2016-11-02 04:23:47
Really? Why so long? That's four months away
@_date: 2017-01-19 12:54:58
Why does the Chinese government care if people gamble their money away?
@_date: 2016-11-01 16:12:44
When is the new deadline for a decsion by the SEC?
@_date: 2017-01-23 13:19:31
I'm not sure I understand why 21 million is so important. If it was increased like a stock split.  There would need to be a hard fork done, and in the process every address containing btc would be doubled, like a  2-for-1 stock split. Of course if you just add to the total unmined, then I would have a problem. I actually think a split could possibly be healthy for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-08 15:41:06
Why is Gemini better? 
@_date: 2016-11-08 07:30:25
@_date: 2016-11-30 14:17:05
Would it be possible to quickly restore the Mycelium wallet from the seed, then send all of the funds to another address and enter a large transaction fee so that it goes through quickly. Would that work? 
@_date: 2017-01-30 06:12:14
BITCOIN's volatility IS DEAD!
@_date: 2016-12-02 15:32:41
I guess a better question would be is if the transaction rate were to never really improve where do you see bitcoin going.
@_date: 2017-01-08 14:48:26
Wow I will defiantly check out Bitsquare. On Coinbase you can also lock place an order and then transfer money from the bank as well.
Are there other exchanges that allow this, I am really curious to know. It's difficult to find this information out without creating an account on each site and fully registering with proofs of ID. Thanks again
@_date: 2016-12-30 06:01:38
Except that they were getting attacked long before any Israeli entered the West Bank. Additionally, international law says nothing about civilian occupation after being attacked by another state.
What they are expected to do is get hit with rockets and do nothing. They are expected to do what no one else would do.
@_date: 2016-12-30 02:00:07
Apartheid state? You cant be serious? You do realize there are over 2 million Palestinians living in Israel right now and no Israelis living in Palestine.  Israel has offered a 2-state solution six times in 1937, 1948, 1967, 2000, 2005, and 2008. The Palestinians have continually called for the death of all Jewish people which is ethnic cleansing. Please don't post things you obviously know nothing about.
@_date: 2016-12-02 15:30:59
I would never want a wizard thinking im an asshole
@_date: 2016-12-30 04:11:46
Go ahead and lookup international law, when you are attacked by a neighboring state you are permitted to military occupation. Israel is well within its rights to occupy the West Bank. An argument however could be made about civilians occupying the land.
@_date: 2016-12-30 03:13:45
The first Jewish state was around 100 - 568 BC
2nd - 538 - 63 BC
3rd 1948 - Present Day
Israel moved legally towards nationhood starting in 1917 with the Balfour Declaration to the San Remo Agreement in 1920 to the League of Nations Resolution in 1922 to the Anglo-American Convention on Palestine in 1924 to the UN Partition plan in 1947 to statehood in 1948
@_date: 2016-12-30 04:37:28
No other country in the world would put up with rockets being launched at it, and Israel won't either. Jordan shouldve thought about that before they attacked.
@_date: 2017-01-03 04:22:09
It typically trades for about $20. During a rally maybe $50. Right now its at $150
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:26:43
Im a hodler, decided I'd try to sell and buy back at a lower price just because I'm an idiot. Nearly had a heart attack. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 15:36:32

@_date: 2015-07-18 13:43:04
He sounds a bit like Dr. Evil, I like that.
@_date: 2015-07-28 07:11:55
How much did the price jump in 2012?
@_date: 2015-07-28 08:12:41
I guess, the price really doesn't move at all until 2-3 months after the halving. 
@_date: 2017-04-05 12:50:02
Ok well, it still doesn't answer my question. If you buy something at the mall, you're not going to stand at the cash register for 8 minutes.
@_date: 2017-04-11 12:53:12

@_date: 2015-08-01 07:53:54
I'm surprised he's still there.  If I was him, I would've been out of there a long time ago.
@_date: 2015-07-20 11:43:56
I'd like to buy bitcoin here in Korea, send it to Coinbase in the US and then sell it depositing the money in my bank account in the US. This is by far the cheapest way to send money internationally. My only concern is that if I send like $1000, am I going to need to worry about this come tax time?
@_date: 2017-04-05 11:22:49
How exactly does this work when it can take a couple hours for a transaction to settle?
@_date: 2017-04-11 13:06:35
@_date: 2016-02-21 02:20:10
I feel like the only answer are centralized side chains

Go all in!
@_date: 2017-04-17 08:57:55
He didn't trade it, he deposited it. Big difference. You don't even know if he was planning to trade it.
@_date: 2015-07-20 11:44:23
Ha, never knew there was a thread like that. Thanks
@_date: 2016-02-25 04:25:19
Why is it almost as secure?
@_date: 2015-07-20 15:46:21
Yeah, coinbase charged me like $9 to sell, I will try mycelium next time. I'm not very familiar with mycelium, it looks like you meet the person. I'm in Korea. Anyways Thanks!
@_date: 2017-04-05 12:30:30
The bitcoin still needs to be sent before it can be converted
@_date: 2016-09-20 11:41:55
I believe it would be higher than 20% if bitcoin wouldn't sell for about $7-8 more per coin in Korea. That adds up when you include exchange fees for buying and selling.
@_date: 2018-03-05 04:56:14

@_date: 2015-11-02 13:28:52
I hope you're not right.
I really don't know much about bitcoin... what happens when all 21 million are mined? Will miners stop mining? Will everything just stop?
@_date: 2017-05-28 05:06:26
How about not investing because of silly infighting

When ethereum did a hard fork there were then 2 chains.  Chain A is Ethereum Chain B is Ethereum Classic. If you want to support Chain A then send all of your Chain B coins to an exchange and sell them for Chain A coins. Now you have no Ethereum Classic coins and more Ethereum coins.
@_date: 2017-05-07 22:49:14

@_date: 2017-07-29 12:41:45
@_date: 2017-07-05 23:14:27
Yeah it actually happened to me years ago. I was selling Ripple on ebay. Paypal told me to send the ripple then 2 days later emailed me saying the account was hacked and not to send it. Of course by then it was too late. I quickly withdrew all my money from paypal. Paypal sided with the person who got hacked. Paypal tried sending a collection agency after me but i just ignored them. Havent used paypal since.
@_date: 2015-10-30 06:08:12
The IOUs were what pissed me off about ripple and it was the reason I got out of it. I remember buying btc on the ripple exchange from say bitstamp, but I wasn't buying btc I was buying a friggin IOU, so I couldn't send it to another exchange and sell it.  Of course I had to learn that the hard way. The whole thing was absolutely infuriating.
@_date: 2016-05-13 07:11:39
Smells like a job for bitcoin
@_date: 2016-07-03 14:31:08
Maybe a stupid question, but does this Bitcoin ETF need to be approved by someone? or is it a sure thing? If so when will this happen? Thanks
@_date: 2017-07-05 13:58:12
That doesn't work if the account is truly hacked because the hacker could post their own public key. Paypal will always side with the buyer.
@_date: 2016-07-03 15:00:16
Thanks, here's one more question. How is this different from GBTC?
@_date: 2016-07-31 01:48:28
I thought the whole purpose of having a trezor was so that you dont need to backup anything.
@_date: 2019-05-17 02:41:12
Wow, that's an incredibly idiotic interview
@_date: 2016-07-03 16:02:28

Is someone going to respond? I guess I could, but there are people on this board that are much more knowledgeable than me.
Here are directions on how to comment
And here is a list of comments that have been submitted.
@_date: 2016-07-12 04:20:30
Your thoughts would carry a lot more weight if you explained why.
@_date: 2016-07-31 02:16:10
Ok yeah, that makes sense. But I fail to see what the point of a hardware wallet is then. I guess it isn't as easy for thieves to steal then ?
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:33:57
I thought there was some sort of agreement reached. What happened to that?
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:59:28
You can store your bitcoin on a Trezor
