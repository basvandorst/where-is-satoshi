This is why a sucker is born every minute.

and people are addicted to their credit card points (my wife being one of them). I didn't get a credit card until I was 30, and I only did it because my wife convinced me it was worth doing for the points.

You can set it to whatever you want, but the concept of making a decision to buy or sell ahead of time based on price is never a good idea.
Your decision to buy or sell should be made at the moment you actually do it because that is when you have the most up to date information about the future prospects of your investment, and also the most information about your next-best alternative use for the money (the opportunity cost).
“Getting your money back” or “doubling your money” are fallacies and should have absolutely no bearing on your investment. It’s difficult, but forgetting what you paid for something is the best way to invest. Also, forgetting the past history of the investment is also helpful. You should be 100% focused on the future and making your decisions in the moment, not making them ahead of time based on some arbitrary price point.

Honestly, most of the value is dictated by investors in Asia right? So what people talk about here probably doesn't affect the price much anyway.

VidAngel did that and got over $10m from ordinary people. The problem is, they offered terms that no VC or angel investor would touch in a million years. They were being sued by all the major film studios at the time they were raising money and were shut down shortly thereafter. 
Companies like this prey on uninformed investors. There is a reason you need to be accredited first.
Here’s a link their fundraising page:

The concept of a "stop loss" is an investing fallacy. The point you bought into something is a sunk cost and completely irrelevant. The only thing that matters is your un-biased evaluation of the investment's future prospects.

The problem is that placing a stop of any kind is always a bad idea because you are effectively making your decision ahead of time based on a meaningless arbitrary price point.
Your decision to buy or sell should be made in the moment based on your most up-to-date information. It shouldn’t matter what you paid for it and it shouldn’t matter what the price is whether it’s $0.05 or $100,000. All that matter is the future prospects (and also your next best alternative use for the money).

It's in society's best interest NOT to give to charity. If you purchase stock from a company that money goes to a private business that uses the money to grow the economy by employing people and providing services to clients. You're giving the money to hardworking men &amp; women who will improve upon it and provide a return.
Charities and government programs (Medicaid, Social Security, education loans, etc...) give money to unproductive people who spend it on food, medicine, etc... These people don't produce much. The private sector isn't perfectly efficient at allocating capital to where it will be used most productively, but it's miles ahead of private charities and government. It feels really good to give to charity, but you have to realize that you're hurting society as a whole when you do it.
Now, if my brother was in trouble and needed help I'd TOTALY give to him and help him get back on his feet. I'd just say to myself "I'm hurting society a little bit to do this, as there is a more producive us of my time &amp; money, but I don't care because he's my brother." But to systematically allocate money to charity is a net drain on society.
