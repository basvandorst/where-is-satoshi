That probably means you haven’t read a lot of stuff from him, or only read about him in our mainstream media.
Or that means that you thought the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan Syria and Libya were fantastic ideas?
There’s a great video on YouTube called « who created ISIS »... it’s got millions of views... and a ton of comments from Americans, all very positive.
Edit: here’s the link to the video, which by the way, has now been black listed by Google. You cannot easily find a link to this video unless you look for it on Duck Duck Go
Before Google/YouTube black listed the search of the video, the video gathered 13 million views, 25 thousands comments, vast majority positive including from American Veterans.

It’s great to dream... but right now we re not there.
To this day... this technology is still not very scalable and super complicated to use. Maybe we can have a big bubble to $120k and a big collapse but is it really what you want?
These bubbles are never good. Lots of people lose a ton of money, and many who do make money don’t make all that much in the end, because the bubble prices prevent them from accumulating... so they don’t have very big balances to begin with.

Right now BTC is king... and I don’t see any valid reason for that to change. 
Look at alt coins... what do we have really? 95 percent of them basically involve removing decentralization to speed up transaction processing.
How are these projects going to compete against Facebook???
If I am going to go for something centralized... what would I rather do:
 - Get something like Ripple/Stellar/Nano/etc that is backed by nothing and minted out of thin air
 - Get a token from a $500 billion company with 2 billion users that is BACKED by ACTUAL DEPOSITS????
Facebook just invalidated these dumb projects.
So that’s it.. we have BTC... maybe a coin or two for privacy (because let’s face it BTC isn’t really perfect for privacy but hopefully that will change)... then something like Ethereum (hopefully Ethereum itself, not a clone like EOS or Tron)..
The good news is Bitcoin’s share of crypto is going up. It’s very exciting. 
It’s so bad for alt coins actually that I saw several posts of alt coiner who are jumping ship. I even saw a post yesterday who claimed that “It is now time for Alt coins to FOMO”. There isn’t any better contrarian indicator than that.

Hopefully there won’t be... buy at least 1 BTC first then buy altcoins if you want.
I’d value innovation personally. I’m a bitcoin enthusiast, but I can’t deny that something like Ethereum is extremely innovative. I can understand why Ethereum wasn’t built on top of bitcoin. There is a reason. Maybe a project like monero makes sense, bitcoin really lacking privacy features. 
But all other altcoins? I don’t see the point honestly. You can’t just call increasing the block size innovation. You can’t call centralized things like XRP where the creator owns like 60 percent of all tokens and where tokens are minted out of thin air « decentralized ». You can’t just get rid of proof of work and pretend that you are decentralized... 
I am glad to see Bitcoin’s share increasing.

That’s one of the reason why I’m kind of bearish now. Prices have tripled in 6 months... yet transaction volume doesn’t appear to go up all that much.

Not sure they would double worldwide.
A good example is France. Electricity if I recollect is 17 cents per kWh.
How much bitcoin mining happen in France with BTC at 10k? 0. How much BTC mining would there be if BTC were $1 million. 0 either.
Same thing with many parts of the US.
So... the only thing that could happen is that electricity prices could increase in regions where electricity is very cheap, but has 0 impact elsewhere.
Also this could create a vague of capital investment in hydroelectricity. To my knowledge, no electricity is as cheap as hydroelectricity. You get a constant flow of electricity 24/7 (unlike solar and wind) and it doesn’t take any energy to create.

They are different things. Bitcoin is money. That’s what it does best. Its simple design makes it extremely robust and it is highly decentralized and secure. It’s scripting language is limited and it is by design, and perfectly sufficient for most payment applications.
Ethereum on the other hand is more like a decentralized system to create an autonomous organization. It is a Blockchain VM that is Turin complete (note that this is a fancy name for something that basically supports loops).
In the end of the day though, Ethereum is a lot more difficult to implement and as such cannot be as secure as bitcoin. It has already been hacked once, it has massive scalability problems (the scalability problems that bitcoin has are nothing compared to Ethereum). Indeed, scalability is all that the Ethereum community is talking about these days.
The really cool stuff that has happened with Ethereum is DAI. It’s a really cool thing. ICO, despite having been all scams, have the potential to be amazing someday.
Note that there is also a sidechain called RSK which wants to bring smart contracts to bitcoin, though I don’t know how successful its going to be. There isn’t a lot of news about it anymore.
There’s no debate in my mind that Ethereum is by far the most innovative project since Bitcoin. It’s the only alt coin I would ever consider buying.
@_date: 2019-08-14 20:50:43
It’s all about what Austrian economists call mal investments.
There needs to be some kind of trigger. In 2007 that was subprime (which was the tip of the iceberg of a mountain of debt they wasn’t going to be paid back), in 2009 that was Greece, in 1999 that was the nasdaq bubble (where a 18 year old who would raise $20 million to start a website selling pop corn), in 1998 that was Russia defaulting.
Right now there is no such trigger. The trigger that causes a bunch of people losing money and prompt other investors to wonder “what’s next?”.
People treat recessions like “bad weather”. But they aren’t. Recessions are almost always the result of excesses.
Where are the excesses now? I don’t think they are in the US or Europe. They are most likely in emerging markets. Massive property bubbles, tons of mal investments, countries that are heavily dependent on China which is slowing down.
The trigger hasn’t happened yet, but when it does I suspect it will be overseas, most likely where no one is looking. And as such, I would expect some currency crash and bitcoin going up while everything else tanks.

I think there’s a strong case that there is still a massive alt coin bubble. 
A good example is Zcash. Did you know that ZCash has a mechanism called miner reward that reward the creators of 20 percent of all mining, paying the CEO nearly $4 million a year?
And this is by far not the worst example out there. There is far worse.
It really reminds the 2000 internet bubble.

How many called $20k bitcoin in 2015-2016? Very few and they were ridiculed.
That’s the BIG difference. Bitcoin tends to do well when nobody believes in it, not the other way around.
The contrarian scenario is a blood bath at the next halving. 
Why? Because everybody thinks it’s going to go up. When it doesn’t go up, everybody is going to panic and sell. Oh, and we will have a big miner crisis, because those blocks with half as much reward are not going to cover jack ****.
Again... how many in 2015 talked about the Bitcoin halving? I don’t remember that many. It certainly wasn’t like now where it’s even mentioned on CNBC!
Even my dad who knows nothing about bitcoin mentioned the halving to me! He heard about it on mainstream news!

It’s the optional passphrase. The other benefit is you get 2FA. I do not believe all bitcoin wallet use it directly.
One way to use it in most bitcoin wallets is to do the following:
 - You can use Iancoleman BIP39 (download the html and use it offline) then use it there, it’s supported.
 - From there you can import the master public key (for cold wallet) or master private key (for hot wallet) in most Bitcoin wallets
If you combine 12 word seed + optional passphrase (stored in different places) you get strong security + simplicity. You can even go one step further and add a balance at the location of the 12 word seed with no password and use it as a honeypot to see if the seed has been stolen, or just provide that if you get robbed. Of course it will be a lot secure if you use this offline

Problem is people tend to over complicate things. So they use 24 words. What’s the point of using 24 words over 12? What computer on earth can break a 12 random word password (128 bit security)???!
Then people get  worried of exposing their seed. So they could use the built in passphrase. But they won’t and instead come up with some complicated setup of AES encryption and Dropbox.
If you think that’s crazy just look at the number of threads where this comes up.

1/ Bitcoins deposits are NOT FDIC insured
2/ If Coinbase loses their Crypto tomorrow - their valuation goes from $8 BILLION to $0. They won’t be able to cover the billions and billions of losses, and they won’t be trusted anymore, nobody will want to use them again.
3/ Square has an order of magnitude more equity than Coinbase yet has a fraction of the crypto deposits - if Square loses their Bitcoin tomorrow their valuation will go down by a FEW PERCENTS.. Square isn’t primarily a crypto exchange. They do that on the side.
4/ Coinbase crypto that is stored in cold storage isn’t insured. Neither is Squares, but the BIG DIFFERENCE is Square can afford to lose that money

It should work... seems very complex though. Why not simply instead create a 24 words BIP 39 seed and store each 12 word at two separate paces. It will be a lot easier to memorize and you can write it down.

The problem with exchanges in general is not that “using custodian is wrong”, is that we are using custodians that are under capitalized and are not using any insurance.

Here’s an idea:
 - Use 24 words mnemonic seed
 - Rent 8 deposit box and store 3 words in each deposit box
 - Change order of the words so that if bankers find the words they can’t do anything with it
 - Store order in a text file with AES 256 encryption both in Gmail and drop box
 - use optional passphrase with mnemonic
 - Store passphrase in text file with AES 256 and store in Yahoo mail
 - Buy fireproof safe and store password for two encrypted text files
That’s it

BRD is not safe enough. It is vulnerable to a rogue developer. For a wallet to be considered safe you need a cold wallet feature, which BRD lacks.
Another problem with hardware wallets is that while they do implement the cold wallet feature, they don’t protect you against address substitution.
Your ideal solution is going to be two Tails VMs. One offline which hold the wallets, and another Tails VM which you hold the watch wallet (and use to transact and get the receiving addresses you want to send the money to). That is the safest.
Another approach is to simply move your funds to a properly capitalized exchange. What’s a capitalized exchange? It’s an exchange that can lose its bitcoin without going bankrupt.
You either do that by.... insuring your bitcoin deposits via good third party (which no one is doing) or... you have the proper equity to liabilities ratio.... which nobody BUT Square Cash App has.

If you don’t want to “be your own bank”, you can just use Square Cash App. 
The problem with custodians isn’t that they are custodians, it is that they are under capitalized and cannot cover their losses in the event of theft or loss.
Why that is? That is because of the nature of the exchange in itself.  Most exchanges are run like bank. They take their deposits and store them (or do fractional reserve lending). Exchanges are capitalized like banks which could be OK if their deposits were insured (just like banks) but the deposits aren’t insured.
So what happens if an exchange lose even like a quarter of their bitcoin deposits? They go bankrupt and there isn’t any government bailing you out.
The solution right now is to simply use Square (if you are in the US):
 - Square is well capitalized, their equity to asset ratio is 30 percent
 - Square is a payment processing company (not a bank) they do BTC on the side
 - Square is worth $30 billion on the stock market.
You can always be your own bank. But my point is that Square is changing the game right now with custodians

My point is that they have more to lose by not paying you back than by paying you back
It would be a public relation nightmare to let people lose their deposits on their app. It would destroy the credibility of the Cash App, and damage the reputation of their brand in general, and hurt the most significant part of their business which is their merchant business.
No they are not philanthropist and I never implied that they were.
Square is a big internet company (huge expertise in the payment industry). They are also related to twitter. I have a very hard time believing that they don’t have very good security in place. 
I would certainly trust Square/Twitter on that matter a lot more than Bitfinex and co.

@_date: 2019-02-02 22:04:37
I agree it’s not right now... but in the future it has a strong change to become it.
Lots of different reasons to own it for every one:
 - e-gold / store of value
 - electronic payments for people without bank accounts (again back to my original point about thinking globally)
 - unethical stuff (buy drugs etc, evade taxes, adult industry etc)
 - remittances
You have this huge network effect that is slowly driving adoption up and up.
But what’s the cooling stuff that many people miss? It’s not paying with bitcoin but getting paid. You have this great system with 0 fees and nearly instant payments.
Think about globalization and the rise of direct to consumer businesses that sell world wide. I bought a luxury watch to my dad last year.. the brand is called Christopher Ward. These guys sell globally. There are increasingly more and more businesses like that, especially with the rise of social media. Look at big YouTube channels for instance, some are starting to create their own brands and their main selling point is that they ship globally (they have a global audience)
Globalisation of services is going to continue to explode. Think Netflix for instance. Think maybe a TV channel like CNN selling worldwide subscription. Imagine the benefit of selling a subscription for something like 20 cents a month to a potential audience of 1 billion people? Do you think 20 cents a month is going to be doable with Visa?
Wouldn’t it be awesome for such businesses to accept something like bitcoin? Think of it: nearly instant payments, nearly 0 transaction fees., works with very small amounts, works with anyone in the world. Can be setup in minutes.
Does it make sense for businesses to accept it now.. maybe not. But there’s gonna be a tipping point where it will, and businesses will no longer accept it for marketing reasons but because it enable them to make more money.
My 2 cents.

I am all for privacy but I strongly suspect here that OP could be shooting himself a bullet in the foot with this.
Look at the transaction. It is so easy for any centralized  exchange / law enforcement agency etc to guess the nature of this particular transaction (eg a bunch of people trying to get anonymity), and consequently flag all the receiving addresses as suspicious.
I would be surprised if exchanges weren’t using this as excuses for freezing funds, but I could be mistaken 
This is a reason in my opinion why we need more privacy at the first layer.

I would argue actually that this feature as it stands is more helpful to criminals than to privacy conscious users. It is not hard to imagine that this tool is extremely popular with drug dealers on the dark web.
IMO this is why we need more privacy on the first layer of bitcoin. Privacy should be the default. That’s the only way we can avoid the “what are you trying to hide?” thing. 
Or maybe this will become extremely common. I doubt it though... but I could be wrong.

Actually bitcoins could revolutionize loans.
Some will argue that bitcoin is too volatile to be lent out.. but you always could lend money in Bitcoin but have your loan tied to the USD or any other currency.
Example: lend out 1 BTC $5k for 1 year and ask to be paid back 1 year from now the amount in BTC of $5k + 5 percent interest
That thing would be revolutionary. When you think of it,  it would actually create some kind of BTC stablecoin. There could be massive demand for that.
This stuff could easily be done via smart contracts where you could enforce rules or anything you like really. You would have an Oracle that would check BTCUSD and price the loan balance in BTC accordingly.
This is why we need to be excited about smart contracts and RSK

As far as weapons, there were no weapons in Syria either, until foreign countries (Saudi Arabia, US, France etc) started to snuggle them into the country.
You don’t fear, like many in the US actually, that the US CIA could use the “humanitarian aid” (which the Red Cross and the U.N. labeled as a political hack and refused to take part of) to smuggle weapons into the country?
You don’t believe that the US’ desire to spread “democracy” in the country is motivated by the massive oil reserves?
My understanding is that there is a huge ethnic component to the crisis. The vast majority of the population is of African/Native descent, similarly as Maduro and Chavez. That is completely ignored by the mainstream media.
There is a huge wealth divide between the whites (my understanding are 25 percent of the population) and those folks.

I think the way futures work is you basically agree to buy or sell a bitcoin in the future at a predetermined price.
Let’s assume you buy 1 future bitcoin contract with delivery of 100 BTC on February 2019. If you hold on to that future on February 2019.. you will have to accept delivery of the bitcoins..
So I am not sure what they mean with “paper” bitcoin. But I know that’s how it works with Oil future contracts. Which is why you in the end, the future market doesn’t really inflate the oil market, because the only market participants holding on to the future contracts until the end are oil producers or buyers who want physical delivery of the oil. Until the expiration of the future contract however it’s all on paper.
Now maybe I’m missing something with bitcoin futures.

Not everybody will use a node. Most people using cell phones will reuse shared nodes which is perfectly fine for small amounts, which is what lightning is designed for. I could from my cell phone use a node in my house. I could also (as is the case today) use a separate custodian like BlueWallet. 
Also, the size of blocks could always be increased. I don’t believe the bitcoin community is necessarily opposed to increasing the block size. What they are opposed to is only relying on increasing the block size to boost the transaction rate, ie we need some off chain mechanism like lightning first. If lightning becomes so popular that the blockchain becomes the bottleneck then I bet there will be more support to slowly increase the block size.

I have been reading them for 10 years. They weren’t around in 2008. They came in 2009. The bottom was early 2009.
They have been calling the stock market a big bubble ever since Dow 6,400.
They have a really poor track record. From overall stock market to stocks like Tesla (which went from $30 to $350 while ZH called the company bankrupt), to being a fan of silver (probably the worst performing asset in the 10 year period), the only thing that Tyler kind of got right is bitcoin. Still though.. they haven’t really been very pro bitcoin either. There were some articles which were somewhat positive.
Most of their readers though have been very bearing with bitcoin, just like they have with Tesla.. and for years.
If you wonder why I read them.. well I like some of the article.. and I like the humor of the writers. The commenters are not very good though, constantly wrong and very racist... most of them are very old I believe.

Please give actual examples OP of how bitcoin is antiquated. Even leaving the lightning network aside, is bitcoin having performance issues so far in 2019?
How are other crypto currencies any more innovative? From outright centralized scams like Ripple to copies like litecoin... from my perspective I really don’t see anything interesting except maybe Ethereum. 
Still I think Ethereum is at major risk of becoming the next Altavista... alternatives like EOS and TRON looks way better... they already solved the scalability problems, and scalability for Ethereum is a big problem. You can’t do DAPps with 15 tx a second.

As much as I think that for an individual bitcoin is more practical than gold... I am not sure the same can be said for a central bank.
Storing gold for an individual is a problem. For a country like Russia with the 2nd or 3rd world military? It isn’t.
Easy transfer of money... again... very good for an individual. For a central bank though? It would be very dangerous to have an individual or even a group of individuals with the private keys. Keep in mind that such individuals could steal all bitcoins yet be granted the red carpet in the US...
Then what about fungibility? Wouldn’t we reasonably know which address belong to such a large holder? Could those addresses be black listed or something? At the end of the day Russia would need the assurance that the balance could easily be converted back to USD. How do you exchange $10 billion worth of bitcoin? Do you just go to coinbase?

According to *mainstream* economic theory. Not all economic theory agrees with that. Fractional reserve lending by the way is by definition a perpetual movement. The only way mathematically that the money + interest be paid back is that the money supply grows exponentially. That’s a fact.
In other words all mainstream economists believe in perpetual movement. That is why it is important to separate economic from science.
There is no such thing as “too much saving”. Saving doesn’t idle. Capital investment relies on real savings to work, not on money printing. Money printing gives you a fake illusion that there are savings but it is a mirage, and sooner or later ends up with the end of the business cycle.

Halving limits inflation and as such has a positive effect on price, but it doesn’t mean that prices will double!
Remember that in the case of bitcoin the mining difficulty is automatically readjusted. So there is a risk that if prices don’t double the hash power will considerably drop as mining will no longer be profitable, thus putting the network at risk.
@_date: 2019-01-12 04:16:53
It’s just me but whatever methods you use you end up having to trust someone, therefore I will stick to coinbase for now. They have a $7 billion valuation. It’s 7 billion reason not to screw up and get the keys or lose them as the company would be worth $0 overnight.

You will have programmable smart contracts that automatically move money from A to B if certain conditions are met. That will actually be a lot more advanced than what we have today.
For bitcoin that will require RSK. I recommend you read about Solidity, the programming language that Ethereum ships, which will work with RSK.
While no person/business in their right mind would want to borrow in bitcoin, you could imagine the loan to be automatically priced in any currency. 
For example: You could lend $10,000 worth of Bitcoins right now and expect to be paid back $10,000 worth of bitcoin a year from now + 5 percent interest.
It would be vastly superior to what we have right now.

Which isn’t a problem. Wouldn’t it be nice if could live without having to over consume? If you had everything at your disposal... wouldn’t even need to spend money... you wouldn’t have people dieing of hunger or cold etc.
And let’s assume for a second that people consume less. That means more savings! More savings to fuel capital investments. 
Fueling capital investments is a far better way to help the economy than fueling consumption of Chinese made products which is the end result of the economic model that people like you prop up!
Tell me if savings were so bad then why was the US the factory of the world prior to 1980? The Americans used to be the biggest saver back then!

I’m 39 and have very good memory of the 2000 crash. We too had this great technology. We were used to massive returns... prices kept going up and up. And there was this Y2K bug that was going to guarantee that IT spending would keep going up and up. Lots of optimism. And look? We were at least right on the fact that the internet would change the world.

That said it’s easier to make money in SF. I remember in 2016 Uber drivers working full time were pulling $2k a week. I actually met a guy who was moving his entire familly from Barstow to SF because of that.
$2k a week isn’t all that much for SF but it’s a lot better than making $12 an hour driving for Uber in other places

Nobody knows..., it took years after the 2013 high for prices to rebound, and there was very little optimism during those years. Not to mention, during those years, the entire crypto market cap was around $10 billion dollars.
Contrast this with now with everybody calling $100k and the market cap is $230 billion
There is a case for a contrarian scenario of prices going nowhere for the next few years, and the Bitcoin halving causing a blood bath.
Why? Because the halving is already priced in! After the halving there is a chance that people will sell the good news, and that there will be a massive miner crisis with the hash rate collapsing.
To that you add dozens of shitcoins trading at hundreds of millions of market cap or more that are worth about $0... I suspect eventually the market will correct those imbalances and those alt coins will collapse to $0, and owners will likely try to cash out, which will likely précipite the collapse, and the centralized nature of those shitcoins will be exposed.

Some random thoughts from a Bitcoin fan who has followed the markets for 20 years:
When bitcoin was $4k earlier this year everybody was bearish. When bitcoin was $10k everybody was bullish.
We all try to find some sort of justification for bullishness:
 - In 1999, it was the Y2K bug. Remember, the Nasdaq had nowhere to go but UP UP UP with that Y2K bug.
 - In 2019 we have Bakkt or Bitcoin halving. Prices will go up guaranteed.... or will they?
Some interesting parallels between 1999 nasdaq and 2019 crypto:
 - In 1999 you could make a killing running a website about anything.
 - In 2019 you can create a shitcoin like Ripple, mine it out of thin air and become a billionaire.
And that’s the big thing... there are many, many shitcoins that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars or more.  Despite the big 2018 crash, these idiotic projects still exists! That’s probably the scariest thing.
What would you do if you if you were the CEO of a scam like Nano or Ripple today? 
- Well, short term, you would probably try to artificially prop up the tokens by throwing some $$ at them. After all, would not it be nice to show that your shitcoin did not tank as much as Bitcoin??!
 - Long term however. You have billions of dollars invested in shitcoin, that are losing their value.  What would you rather have $100 million + or 50 cents???? What would you do? You would just dump them as fast as you can...
I personally wouldn’t be surprised that we will someday see a BIG SUDDEN CRASH with dozens of shitcoins going to $0. I am not sure what this would do to Bitcoin, but remember that Amazon did not do so well when the Nasdaq crashed.

“You have to maintain separate channels with every single entity you want to transact with or trust a centralized networks of hubs”
I am not sure this is correct.  As long as a valid circuit exists between you and the recipient, I don’t believe that there is any special “trust” with any of the nodes involved.  With onion routing, the hubs actually know very little about the origin and destination of the payment, and the payment is atomic.

I understand that the lightning network is at its infancy so it’s out of the question now... but it should be something that should be by design... and become possible once traffic grows
Edit: Eg sounds to me that charging 1/1000 Satoshi as the standard fee is not the way to go. Doesn’t make much a difference from a user or merchant perspective if I pay an order of magnitude higher (eg a couple cents) per transaction but make a huge difference for decentralization

Mainstream politicians and economist hate deflation, but there isn’t any rational evidence against it. Their rational is that deflation would lead to increased savings and that savings are inherently bad in their mind. In their view, spending is key.
You look at savings the US used to have the biggest saving rate in the world (1980 and prior). What we usually find is that increased saving rate is usually associated with more manufacturing jobs (such as the US until 1980 and China today).
If you want to have an example of an industry that is in deflation... look no further than technology. Computer prices have gone down, yet look this is hottest place to work for today.

There are two devices... one online and one offline. The online device is just used for everyday stuff... and sends the transaction. It doesn’t contain any private keys. Signing is on the cold device only and the devices communicate via QR code.
You could temporarily turn off airplane mode to update IOS...(if the device is always in airplane mode though I am not sure the IOS updates matter as much anymore)
That said, if you just run the bitcoin wallet software that does the signing in airplane mode... what can possibly happen as far as “rogue developer” risk?
I actually looked for a way to prevent an app in IOS from accessing the network but I couldn’t find anything. Only option is to prevent the app from using LTE (it can always access WiFi)

Each channel that is used needs to have at least a 50 BTC balance in it to be reused, so lightning works best with very small payments. The higher the payment the more likely it will fail.
Additionally, I believe there is an amount cap with lightning... I forgot how much though...  but I don’t think it’s very high (a lot less than 50 BTC)
My 2 cents... more detailed/accurate answers will follow

I don’t think you can compare cryptocurrency to credit cards. Crypto currency is currency, credit cards are payment processing. Credit cards are built on top of bank accounts.

I personally am experiencing with ArcBit on IOS. I like it better than BRD because it uses COLD WALLETS.
So you have two IOS devices, you use one in airplane mode as cold wallet (for signing) and the other device online that you use as watch only address and to make transactions (signing only happens on the offline device and the devices communicate via QR codes)
So you get the security of IOS (when unjailbroken and up to date) plus the strength of cold wallets, and overall its pretty user friendly.
I feel this is much stronger than hardware wallets, and doesn’t cost anything (obviously you need two IOS devices)

Government money relies on the system to be rigged. The fiat system doesn’t cost very much real money to run. A very tiny of the base money supply is backed by real money like gold.
There is no way governments will get involved in mining bitcoin unless they can either do it at a profit or they can rig the system.
Even when government money was backed by gold the system was rigged. Governments were always printing more money than gold and that is precisely why Nixon defaulted on the gold in 1971. 
Until 1971, an ounce of gold was worth $32. That had been the case for something like 140 years! Americans however couldn’t easily convert their dollars to gold at that rate, but foreign countries could. That is why countries like France, as early as 1965, concerted huge amount of dollar reserve to gold (at the $32 artificial peg rate). They saw that the US was printing vast amount of dollars to fund the war in Vietnam and that couldn’t be possible backed by gold. That eventually led to Nixon defaulting on the gold, and leading to the system of today with 2 BR 800 sq ft fixer house in Venice costing $2 million.
The whole security of bitcoin relies on miners being able to mine for a profit. That is not going to go away. The mining difficulty gets adjusted accordingly so that is always possible.

Look at a good example: Panama. Panama doesn’t have its own currency.. instead it is entirely dollarized and that has been the case for 114 years.
Note that it isn’t a peg. The government isn’t trying to keep an unrealistic and artificial exchange rate against market forces (that will always blow up eventually) Instead they use pure dollars and they don’t have a central bank printing those dollars.
Now tell me... try to compare Panama with other countries in the region and let me know which one is the most stable, has the least inflation and has the lowest poverty rate.
Panama is the greatest example that you don’t need a government printing its own currency.
Does that mean that you don’t need taxes? No. But taxes should not come from printing money.

Reality is that the US is launching a coup. 
You will get fired if you say that in the mainstream media. But ask any independent US politician, from Ron Paul to Dennis Kucinich, to Tulsi Gabbard... they will tell you.

Interesting. 
A month ago I listened to an interview of Greg Palast (from the guardian). 
He personally knew Hugo Chavez. He explained how Hugo Chavez had screwed the Koch brothers. Chavez knew that the Koch Brothers’ refinery was dependent on the heavy oil crude that Venezuela produced. So he decided to raise prices (despite the fact that the heavy crude oil is of lesser quality), knowing that the Koch brothers had no other options.
Chavez was a lot smarter economically than Maduro that’s for sure.  He probably paid a high price for it.
That story kind of helped me understand your comment.

I don’t know. Would you want to receive bitcoins from a bad address? What makes you think anyone else would?

“Be your own bank” probably wasn’t why satoshi invented bitcoin. It was released  as an alternative to banks fractional reserve lending. It’s about sound money. You can have sound money in a bank. You cannot have sound money however in a world of fiat currencies and fractional reserve lending.
 Maybe you as a nerd understand how to securely store bitcoin, but you can’t assume that OPs dad can. You will always have room for custodians who have the proper expertise to secure this stuff.

Seems to me that increasing the fees slightly to make it profitable to run a node would yield far greater decentralization

I don’t get the point of these hardware wallets when you can use cold wallets
It’s obvious that the physical device itself adds another layer of risk.
How can these things beat a cold wallet on a Linux Tails VM??

Watch out. I too made some “lucky” moves like that. Bought $2k worth of Netflix in 2011, sold for $3k, then after I sold, it crashed 50 percent. I thought I was a genius.
Fast forward in 2019. How much would my stake be worth now? $80k
I really don’t recommend day trading. Not to mention, you get killed in taxes.

Google DAI. It’s basically a token that is guaranteed to be worth $1. Each DAI is basically backed by Ethereum that are hold as reserves, and it is 100 pc backed. 
It’s entirely decentralized. No bank account, and it is auditable. The only counter party risk is basically Ethereum.

I think paper is more secure l because the signing happens on a device that isn’t connected to the internet.
The firmware on a ledger is not even open source. You can’t know for sure that there isn’t something that leak the private keys. Plus you need to store that device somewhere it is a real hassle.

What happens if I have a direct link with the person I am paying? That would show on the blockchain right?
Also... I thought that was more of a solution for small payments. Let’s assume I make a 10 BTC payment on the lightning network, doesn’t that imply that each channel must have a balance of at least 10 BTC for that channel to be reused? Eg the higher the payments the more difficult it would be to find a route

I don’t know why anyone is mad at OP. Did you bother to search reddit for people who lost their money because of the change address issue?
There are a lot of cases! Some people lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in today’s dollars. 
I agree that OP is kind of describing the issue in a wrong way. The real problem is the change address issue, which is not caused by bitcoin itself, but by the stupid design of some wallets which by DEFAULT send the change to a different address than the sending address.
This should not be the default behavior in a non deterministic wallet. That obvious. I honestly would be ashamed if I were the designer of Multibit. This should have been immediately flagged as a defect and addressed.
People should 1/ make sure to understand how change in bitcoin works 2/ make sure to use a deterministic wallet!
There is no reason to not use a deterministic wallet anyway in 2018.

I think people are missing the massive innovation that smart contracts could bring.

Use it as e gold... keep in mind you don’t have as many options as some of us do in western countries, but against your local currency Bitcoin has better odds so keep that in mind.  It may be worth the effort to get some.

If you really care about privacy then maybe you should use something other than bitcoin... or just cash. 
I think it’s a dumb *default* behavior... I feel bad for the guys who lost hundreds of thousands over this. I think the design is so bad in this case anybody could have made that same mistake. I certainly would have.
The privacy gains are debatable, but the risks of making a costly decision that can mess you up are real

Think about the stupidity of what you r doing OP...
You take something that has 256 bit of entropy and turn it into what... 90 bit?
Cracking a 12 character password definitely won’t take millions of years. I believe the common encoding with zip just uses XORs and you can do a ton of try per second.
Then let’s get to the other part. How do you even perform this action? You mentioned “zip”... so it sounds like you are entering the seed into a Windows box. Was that box connected to the internet?
What about viruses and malware? 
What about the antivirus that knows everything you are doing?
What if the file gets corrupted?
You should try to keep it simple:
 - 12 word seed that you learn - 128 bit of entropy
 - You want to increase it further? Use the built in passphrase
Don’t reinvent the wheel
