More reasons to avoid ringgit like the plague.
It's only going to get worse from here.

Don't worry too much man. For a 16 year old in Malaysia you're doing a fantastic job with that kind of monthly income.
Just remember that Bitcoin has a great potential to succeed and fail. So never hold all your eggs in a basket.
Look into cold storage options and paper wallets for your bitcoins.

Awww it's sold out.
I'd like to set up a bunch of nodes with them.
Price is really attractive

I'd recommend Trezor for now.
But in the long run I'd print out a bunch of paper wallets with Mycelium Entropy and laminate them.

I can totally see myself buying a house with my bitcoins.

Bither cold on a brand new android phone
Bither hot on my iPhone 
I'd dump half of my paycheck into my cold wallet every month. And the cold wallet is safety tucked away in my safe. 
No one is touching my stash!
