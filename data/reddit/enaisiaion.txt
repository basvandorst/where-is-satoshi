@_date: 2017-12-30 14:11:22
It's not that lots of people are selling... it's that no one is buying.
Bitcoin is completely useless at the moment. It may or may not scale eventually, but coins with promises of future updates are usually not worth $10K. Those are penny coins and if you believe in the technology, you can buy them and potentially make 1000% or lose your investment.
For people to buy the dip, they have to believe that the asset has an inherently higher value than it is currently valued at, or at least that there will be greater fools to buy it from them. I won't get into the "it's just numbers" argument; a peer-to-peer electronic cash system does have inherent value.
Unfortunately, bitcoin is no longer a working payment system. The recent "attacks" (using the system as designed is not an attack) demonstrated that the system is much more fragile than was promised. So bitcoin no longer has any inherent value as a currency. It was never meant to be a store of value and does not function as a store of value anyway what with the wildly fluctuating price.
While crypto does have potential, the current crop of mainstream cryptos does not. Core is tone deaf, Ethereum drowned in kittens and Litecoin doesn't do anything different other than being less popular and having faster blocks. Proof of work is a dead end route in general, what with miner drama and the fact that it uses almost as much electricity as Trump's private jet (*now* people care about global warming??).
I can see a bear market throughout 2018. The term "cryptocurrency" may even become poisoned if enough people lose enough money. Eventually, a better coin with proof of stake, instant transactions and low/no fees will find niche success and the next bubble will inflate from there.

@_date: 2017-12-22 14:34:44
The price of BTC is not a "problem" unless profit is the only reason you bought in.
What is a problem is that BTC has demonstrated without a doubt that it can't scale and therefore can't fulfill its core premise. I can see a long winter until some other coin shows up that scales properly, and then the bubble will repeat with that coin instead.

@_date: 2018-05-19 10:37:13
There's a good chance we'll be paying with some form of crypto in 10 years' time, but it won't be BTC. It's slow, expensive \(blocks are still 1 MB and the only reason the mempool is clear is that people stopped transacting\), relies on an overly complex second layer solution to scale, and still has the terrible PoW that's using more power than a small country and is on course to negate all recent advancements in green energy.
At best, Ethereum or some other semi\-known coin moves faster and implements the necessary scaling and PoS.
At worst, none of the coins find any kind of mainstream success as BTC is yesterday's coin and preferences are split among the million other 2nd and 3rd gen coins in circulation, holding up adoption for all of them while banks and tech unicorns continue work on their own digital currencies \(not necessarily "crypto"\). The day you can pay for your groceries with Amazoncoin is a lot closer than the day you can do it with BTC.
China pays for everything with Alipay, which is already "money in an app", it's just tied to the user's bank account in yuan. Once the Chinese government decides to push its own centrally controlled crypto, that's it, mainstream adoption of crypto is achieved.
In the West, Facebook or Amazon may skip the government step and just add a feature to buy, trade and pay with their own credits. That wouldn't be proper crypto either but convenience always wins and people will convert their money into credits at a staggering rate with a giant smile on their woolly face. "Money in an app" is all anyone needs, after all.
And as our new global digital currency of the future turns out to be Facebookcoin, the only remaining use case for crypto will be the dark net.
I don't support BCH, but still, thanks very much for setting crypto back two years while showing your hand to people with a thousand times the resources and an incentive to beat your ass, Blockstream.

Hey, they took the *risk* of spending $100 before anyone else.

That would be the optimistic view.
The pessimistic view says there will be an economic depression and societal implosion as governments realise they are no longer able to levy taxes to keep public services going or pay back their debt. Sovereign debt becomes worthless, causing another banking crash, this time without bailouts. Governments resort to bans to stop the flood, losing all legitimacy and causing them to fall in a frenzy of violence.
The rich will make sure to have a position in crypto before that happens. They are rich for a reason, and even if that reason is that their parents were rich, they will make sure to invest what they can lose, which to them is 100 million. The middle class will be too late and will get wiped out, losing their savings in the crash and having to buy crypto at $25K/coin. The gap between rich and poor increases massively and the government is down and out, forcing millions of them into the gig economy where a bad rating equals losing everything and dying under a bridge.
It is a great future if you are into cyberpunk, but most people in cyberpunk are not the decker or street shaman.

Obviously not, as much as that one stupid ICO wants it to be. The entire point is mass redundancy, not computing power.


Not necessarily so. There are ways around this, including but not limited to a blockchain snip and Lightning Network.


Lightning Network. Also, BTC is gravitating to be a store of value like gold, and gold transactions take a little bit longer than 1 hour.


He's wrong. Miners don't protect against each other, but against rogue forces with big computers. The point is to have enough computing power mining so that it becomes unfeasible for a third party to come in and alter the blockchain without throwing unrealistic amounts of money at it.


The idea is that any miner attempting a 51% attack will be shooting themselves in the foot. They can't do it covertly and they will crash the value of the currency if they try, undermining (heh) their entire business model.
China is a problem, though, but there are ways to cut out miners entirely and migrate to a proof of stake model if this becomes a pressing issue.


He's wrong again. Tumblers exist. Put your BTC through a tumbler and it becomes anonymous to any observer short of the FBI.

The POW change should be aimed at CPU/GPU mining so there is some hashpower still available. Killing the current POW in favour of counting sheep just means BCH has more hashpower and opens up an opportunity for a third party to build/source enough hashpower faster than the community can and do a 51% attack on BTC.
To be honest, I don't mind Jihan. He's a malicious actor, but at least his only motivation is to pump BCH. Imagine someone in the same position who wants to destroy the entire crypto space. It's up to BTC to survive this relatively weak attack and become stronger.

The community knows that fees are a problem and works on solutions (Segwit, Segwit2X if you believe in that, second layer networks).
However, right now Bitcoin Cash is periodically pulling half of the hashpower away to mine easy blocks for a few days, at the cost of BTC (it works both ways: Bitcoin Cash is pretty much unusable at any other time), and its proponents are sabotaging BTC by mining empty blocks on purpose. This is the equivalent of an ongoing DDoS attack. One would hope they eventually bugger off or at least focus on their own coin instead of trying to hobble BTC.

I don't see the rich mounting any kind of resistance. They'll make sure to profit from the cryptocoin boom, because that's their job. I'd be more afraid of:
* An end to growth if a permanent solution for transaction costs does not arrive in time or no real world applications show up within the next year or so, solidifying crypto as the new gold rather than the new money.
* Centralisation of mining operations in the regions with the cheapest electricity, enabling people like Jihan to become the face of the coin and undermining its legitimacy as a *global* currency. (Any coin that can be wiped out by one B-17 worth of payload is not a valid currency.)
* Government propaganda ("drug money"), exchanges walking away with the money and account closures by banks adding up to a detrimental stigma around cryptocurrencies.
In the medium term:
* A cryptographic vulnerability, either due to quantum computing or some other as-of-yet unforeseen breakthrough.
* Heavily pushed competitors by major market players. What if Facebook launches a coin in 2018 with much fanfare and builds it into the app, followed by Google, Apple's iCash, ChainPal and Microsoft's Tokens for Business? If this scenario comes to pass, we would still move towards a crypto world, but it would be in the hands of megacorps instead of the people.
* China or Russia becoming an enemy on the level of the Soviet Union. It would be so easy to portray crypto as "Chinese currency" or "Putin money", but no worries, the ECB or Fed will release its own patriotic competitor and your country would *appreciate* it if you made the switch, if you know what I mean.
* A straight up ban by a government. Sure, it won't stop the global avalanche, but it will leave people in that country stranded, and if that country is the US, that's a lot of wealth stuck outside crypto.
In the long term:
* A 51% attack by a three letter agency belonging to a major government.
* Middle class resistance. They will be too late and get wiped out along with their banks and governments, so they will fight tooth and nail to keep their fiat valuable.
* Resistance to the idea of no government. While the government should probably lose the ability to print money, they will be unable to raise taxes at all and will go down. This looks like a good thing until you need the police or want to use a road. A world in which crypto is the undisputed winner will look a lot like a dystopia.

Because the people who launched them will try and pump them to attract miners. Sitting on your B2X until that happens and selling it to them for inflated prices is probably a better idea than joining the stampede 5 seconds after the fork.

The link above is actually a Bitcoin Cash takeover attempt, but that specific scenario isn't likely to happen. The same sort of thing with 2X would have vastly more backing and a higher chance to succeed.
If it does, users would have to move to 2X, and Core would be out of the game.
The miner behind the link is a cartoon villain, but he has a point. Miners literally just need to stop mining BTC for two weeks and it will be dead. This is something no one is talking about, and the reason why this failed before with BCH is because it still allows Asicboost so other miners didn't back it.
This time, despite all the cheering on whenever an organisation drops out of the NYA, the vast majority of miners is still signalling S2X. They are scary close to being able to stall out the legacy chain, and there are huge long term benefits for them in doing so: firing Core means shutting down off-chain scaling and any future plans of switching to proof of stake.
Don't sell your 2X coins for BTC the minute your exchange opens is what I'm saying.

Thing about alts is, they're not worth money just because they exist. That ship has sailed. They have to actually *do* something.
Monero is one of those, and I have no clue why it's down, other than the fact that all speculative money is currently being stuffed into BTC for the airdrop. It should rally as the black helicopter people and slave traders flock back to it after selling their free B2X coins. Ethereum also does something, it's just that what it does is enable scam ICOs, so people stopped caring. BCH does something in that you can count on Jihan to pump it every once in a while and you need it to buy mining equipment.
Any coin whose USP is that it is "more useful in the real world" is doomed, because market forces will ensure BTC becomes useful in the real world. All those billions aren't going to sit around watching the blockchain slow down and the world adopt Litecoin.

@_date: 2017-11-27 10:09:40
The bottleneck is currently the biggest problem affecting bitcoin. The network can (and often does) get congested, slowing down transactions to several hours and/or forcing users to pay extortionate fees on the order of $20 per transaction.
The SegWit update was meant to increase throughput, but for various reasons (it required third parties to update their code)
The solution is to grit one's teeth for now until Lightning Network arrives and most transactions (such as the proverbial coffee purchase) can take place off chain, using the blockchain as a settlement layer and reducing the number of blockchain transactions.
Alternatively, alt coins exist that feature increased blocks (Bitcoin Cash) or other solutions. Most of those alt coins are unlikely to become mainstream unless Lightning is a complete failure, which may or may not be the case. Bitcoin Cash in particular is one that is getting some traction because it has cheap and fast transactions right here and now, even though all it really did was kick the can down the road with a block size increase and the people behind it are terrible scumbags.

2. Selling everything before the split, near the peak of the bull run, before everyone gets cold feet.

I'm surprised the short term market isn't flooded with bots yet. It is not hard to catch a wave up and sell $50 higher for a bit of profit; doing this over and over and over seems like something a bot could well do (especially a neural network), eliminating the need for a human to watch depth charts. The main risk is having it thrown out the window because a whale does something and moves the price $100 in seconds.

I fully expect cryptocurrencies to get banned by most governments at some point, or at least assimilated into the system.
My hope is that it happens *after* the idea enters the public consciousness, so it will look like an act of blatant censorship rather than a wise move to protect innocents from bitcoin predators.
After the European war on cash, if people see their monetary escape hatch also shuttered and their money essentially trapped by the government, they might realise that the government does not have our best interests at heart and is going to steal our money in order to pay off their debt. This might lead to political change and the abolition of big state socialism.

Thing is, you don't diversify for the sake of spreading risk; usually when one coin falls, they all fall. Unless you're a day trader in penny coins, you should find the most promising project and invest in that.
In the end, you're (hopefully) not here to make some easy $ but because you believe in the importance of crypto as a store of value, a novel way to pay for coffee and/or an asset to protect your wealth in the face of the imminent economic crisis.
Depending on which you value, find the coin that benefits you the most.
As of now, altcoins are falling compared to BTC because there seems to be a feeling that BTC is on the verge of "becoming important" due to any of the above (though probably not the coffee one). If this happens, BTC will moon; if not, it will go down like ETH when it became clear that its smart contracts merely enabled an endless parade of scam ICOs. Your choice!

"It is in a bear market. Why would I buy an asset that's crashing?"
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:35:21
The way I see it is: you will never lose *all* of your investment even in a crash and bear market. Make sure you pay some attention to what is going on, and if you approach the point where you *would* lose more than you can afford, eat your losses and sell.
I'm currently in for twice as much as I could throw out the window, but I'm pretty sure if it ever crashes to $2K, I'll abandon ship in time. I check the news a few times a day just in case someone cracked the blockchain or something; other than that, I went in at $2.5K so idgaf if there's a dip.
Conversely, buying into crypto is a hedge against a fiat crash. I'm getting a bad feeling lately.
However, don't invest into low cap alts or ICOs and don't fall for FOMO. Some ICOs ate shit last night and lost well over half of their value overnight. That won't happen to BTC.

Bitcoin desperately needs a scaling solution to become viable for the mainstream. This community is apparently unable to reach a consensus without forking three ways.
The first fork (Bitcoin Cash) is behind us and the forked coin turns out to be a clown fiesta and pretty much useless except every once in a while when it adjusts its difficulty downwards and suddenly every miner goes over and mines it for a bit, bringing the main version to a halt.
The second fork (Segwit2X) is technically superior but has no backing from the community because it is seen as a power grab and an attempt to exclude the core developers, and seems to get very little developer attention. Of course, most miners will back it regardless because money.
The most likely outcome: the main version will have no miner support and transactions will grind to a halt, while the forked version is usable but hated by everyone and stops further development. GG.
Oh, and both parties refuse to implement a feature to prevent transactions on one chain from applying to the other, potentially causing people to lose a ton of money in the process in order to try and prove a point that they are the legit chain.

Let's translate this:
*"The price is going up, but there's this magical line here. If it breaks through that, expect the price to sky rocket (because everyone looking at this chart right now will fomo in when it does). If it doesn't break through the line, expect the price to crash (because everyone looking at this chart right now will dump as soon as it bounces)."*
TA has merit in regular markets where movements are actually based on fundamentals (insert joke about stock market bubble) and breaking through a resistance level means something changed about the asset or the circumstances and now more people value it higher than before.
In crypto, the underlying value of an asset is irrelevant, volume is relatively low and people buy and sell based on what they think other people will do. Not many people really think the actual value of a bitcoin is 8K or 9K or whatever and then change their opinion in a matter of days for no external reason. So TA is not based on any reality.
However, TA allows traders to make an educated guess as to what other traders will do, ensuring they more or less move as a cartel and each trader benefits. There's no reason to go against TA even if you don't believe in it, and the effectiveness of TA increases as more people follow it; making this the equivalent of the crypto bubble itself inside the bigger crypto bubble. :P

TA works, but mostly because *other* people believe that it works. The reason the price bounces off a support or resistance level is because everyone else also looks at the same graphs and buys/sells accordingly, making it a self-fulfilling prophecy.
For instance, as the price approaches the tip of a triangle, everyone is watching like a hawk to see which way it will break out. Then random fluctuations occur (the triangle gets narrower as it goes, so a few big orders can decide the outcome) and suddenly everyone panic sells or fomo buys and *causes* the rally or dip they were expecting to happen.
(Of course, if you are a whale, you have access to the same charts and you *know* people are waiting to see what will happen. And in the case of the triangles, you even have a deadline. So you place that buy order to trigger the breakout, everyone piles in, and then you dump a few hundred higher and walk away with your free money as the price "gets rejected" and everyone else is a bit poorer.)
@_date: 2018-02-11 12:02:16
I sold because there was much excitement about the 20K milestone but no short term targets after that, so people were going to take profit at that point. When momentum was lost due to fewer people buying in near the obvious peak and more people selling near the obvious peak, it was obviously going down.
No TA needed, just basic common sense. My only regret was that I didn't have enough time to watch closely and sold a day and 1K too late. Whatever, price crashed to a third since then.
If anything caused people to lose money, it was blabbering about "every crash is followed by a rally" and "weak hands" even though bitcoin had become completely unusable at that point and there were no fundamentals to warrant any kind of price.

Long term is not 48 hours though. It is obvious that miners (who initiated the split to begin with) will start out mining B2X while nodes and users will stick with BTC. Miner support is the *only* thing B2X has, at least until its price falls and miners run out of patience to mine at a loss.
Setting the deciding factor of short term hashpower pretty much hands the win to B2X because it is the one criterion it is likely to be ahead on. This is not a coincidence. It demonstrates picking sides. It's like determining the 6th place team to be the winner of a car race because they had the fastest pitstop.

4) Doing nothing is the safest option - since there's no replay protection this time round, spending either coin may result in spending both coins. There are [tricks]( to split your coins, but I'd wait for some sort of official confirmation before risking your money.
While you could make bank by speculating on which coin goes to zero and dumping it as fast as possible after the fork, don't do this without making sure your coins are split.
5) We started with X number of BTC and ended up with X number of BTC and X number of BCH. Because the common wallets (including Electrum) only displayed the value of BTC associated with your keys, you had to install another wallet (Electron Cash) to access the value of BCH associated with your keys and transfer them to an exchange to dump them. Many people didn't bother, some were savvy enough to do so within hours of the fork (causing the price of BCH to crash), and the poor fools on Coinbase couldn't access their BCH at all.
If you miss the opportunity to dump either chain *immediately* after the fork, selling it after everyone else is a waste and it may pay off to hodl and see if someone pumps it later. I missed the BCH dump but sold a few weeks later when Jihan pumped it to $600.

Panic selling works *if* you do it quickly enough and it falls far enough to be able to buy back in at a profit.
The problem is that you don't know the top and bottom until they happen because they are disconnected from any fundamentals and are tied to such considerations as "it looks like it's been high for a while" or "it hit a round dollar amount" (disguised as channels and resistance in the graphs).
You just have to guess what everyone else is going to do, and if you mistime it, you'll eat a heavy loss. It works... but it's more risky than just hodling.

BTC has advantages in specific scenarios such as an economic meltdown (Venezuela), offering a way for citizens to get their wealth out of the system.
If all goes well and most people are fine with the current banking system, there is little reason for BTC to exist. If not all goes well, however...
So buying BTC is not a gamble that it will replace gold for no reason in clear weather, but that there will be a major economic crash in the near future that forces many people to choose: buy BTC or lose their savings. Given the war on cash in Europe, the (still) growing state debt and the spectre of automation, this is becoming an extremely likely scenario.

No one cares, and I mean this in the nicest way possible. A product could cost 5% more for the guarantee that it wasn't made from the bones of child slaves and people would go for the vanilla product instead.

This. Even if 2X is technically superior and has more support, a win for 2X means the loss of what BTC stands for, at which point it and the entire crypto market no longer has a future and you should sell and walk away.

Triangles and Elliott waves especially. Triangles not only predict the price must rocket either up or down, but also set a deadline. The reason they actually work is that as the triangle gets narrower, the slightest jitter in the price will cause a breakout in one or the other direction and then everyone fomos in or dumps and makes it a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Elliott waves are supposed to express the idea that markets move between optimism and pessimism on a somewhat large scale, not to make predictions for the next three hours that are so specific that one would have to assume everyone but the trader is a retard and trades at a loss exactly five times in a row. I have yet to see this ever pan out.

The idea is that the adoption of crypto requires a critical mass of users, and rewarding people with money for adopting it brings us closer.

I was on a crypto trading discord server and saw this pan out in real time. The triangle getting narrower, then someone posted a screenshot of a wick peeking above the triangle (which was &lt;$100 wide at that point so perhaps someone just placed a big order) and it filled up with yells of BREAKOUT! and I assume they all bought at that point. More charts appeared and people shouted it was going allll the way to $X where the next resistance was and to sell there. I bought in to ride the pump, set a sell order a bit below the point where they were all going to sell and went to bed.
Woke up to see there had been an epic dump halfway up nowhere near any important price level, the price was plummeting (I panic sold at a $50 loss) and people on the server were lamenting that they got burned, it was going to $4K and they would never sleep in crypto again.

Firstly, the libertarian dream where the government somehow does not pay attention for 20 years, finds itself no longer able to levy taxes and comes apart would be as dystopian as it would be unlikely. In between wasting money and giving handouts to the undeserving, the government actually does useful stuff as well. No functioning government means social order breaks down, and the have-nots won't accept "you should have bought crypto in 2017, sucker" as a valid justification for why they lost all their savings. The world would look a lot like Honduras.
I do think crypto will succeed, but on a much slower scale. Tech employees will want to get paid in crypto, followed by the rest of society, not driven by a genuine interest in a new economic model but rather because a social network adds the feature, much like WeChat has become the most popular way to pay among young urban Chinese.
Until then, governments will first try to ban what they don't understand, then try to make it work for them once they do understand, by legalising crypto but forcing citizens to register their addresses under threat of jail.
Eventually, the world will settle on a combination of crypto and other stores of value and payment methods. No revolution, just a gradual transition that will look nothing like what crypto nerds expected, much like the internet looks nothing like the anarchist paradise its pioneers expected in 1992.

That's important. Of course all the miners will mine B2X at first, but if their mined coins have no value, they'll gravitate back to BTC eventually, before they run out of money.
In the end, if BTC has the most nodes and community support, it'll hold the highest value, and therefore more miners will mine it and it will have the highest difficulty. Just let it shake out.
