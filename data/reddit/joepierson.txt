As people have asked you REPEATEDLY: confirm these loans with an actual source, or specify clearly that you have the information from an inside source.

Well, thank you so much for letting us know about this.  
  
Does anyone know how to compare the daily volume of exchanges for the last week, or the last 10 days? Maybe by identifying similar movements in volume across certain exchanges, we can find out which ones have colluded for this to happen.

How do you know that the loans had a 72 hour term? Any source on that?

Why did the exchanges loan so much money to certain traders? Did they want to get the commission from a lot of positions on the bull and the bear runs? Plus the interest on the loans?  
Also... any idea which exchanges did this?

OK, the operator of which exchange called? What's the phone number? We'll track it.

He states in another thread that he loaned $125,000 personally and more has been loaned by certain BTC exchanges:  


Let's not put him down, he might actually be correct and willing to help us fight the price manipulations (this seems to be his objective, and it's laudable). It's well known by traders that there is A LOT of manipulation done when it comes to the Bitcoin price.

For a bit of balance in the thread, this has happened before, even with the main chain. It was not the Apocalypse.

It's not really news; it's always been clear that:
1. The Bank of England knew about the Libor rigging as it happened
2. And was, at a minimum, very happy with the results (given that it reduced the risk of bank runs imperiling the entire system)
3. And that nobody involved really thought this was a serious issue, much less a crime.
Putting the above together, it would be surprising if there wasn't some pressure from the Bank of England to push Libor down; why wouldn't they be doing that? In the circumstances, it would have practically been remiss of them to do otherwise.
Of course, it looks absolutely horrific now that we've decided that manipulating Libor is a serious issue that people should go to prison for!
