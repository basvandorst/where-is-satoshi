im pretty sure they r a scam. i remember them posting a promo where first one to hit 3x in a row won, they never paid out (i wasnt the winner)  
they deleted their post afterwards

How is there an arbitrage opportunity here? Unless the bitcoin price remains static. Wouldn't they just adjust its btc price constantly?

congrats! I still believe in dogecoin, but i was really interested in bitcoins. I traded about 50k of dogecoin for btc while the rate was favorable about 2 weeks ago. Ironically, the rest of my dogecoins were stolen in the dogevault hack =p  
Really glad I at least got some of it out for bitcoins. The value of bitcoins has increased about 30% since I got it too XD

martingale only works on the false assumption u have infinite funds -.-  
I wish i could feel bad for him, but hes just a dumbass. If he ends up in jail, zero sympathy from me. He basically stole the btc
@_date: 2014-06-18 03:01:39
yo don't hate on dogecoin ;)
@_date: 2014-08-31 22:22:46
just don't write any call options, u gotta believe in btc :D  
also i doubt anyone would buy it without a definite way to enforce it (writer could just disappear)  
I think this is why margins are more prominent right now

u mean the community of ppl who have nothing better to do than stroke their ego cuz they have a high IQ?
@_date: 2014-07-11 03:14:31
so what u r saying is that i should put my bitcoin in a paper wallet and then eat it?
@_date: 2014-07-01 22:58:45
this is a great challenge, but if he wins, he gets less money than u. Even if he is stupidly confident. Might wanna change it to USD and demand he exchanges it for btc to pay u when u win

ps coinbase.com is giving away $10 of btc to certain college emails. Check if u r elligible =p

im excited about getting more involved with btc, found out there are still some students who are btc enthusiasts left at my college campus during this summer
