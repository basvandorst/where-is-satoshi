Actually, value can be created out of thin air.
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:58:21
Wait 1-2 years when 10x more people are accepting crypto in lieu of fiat.

Is  it free to sell too?
Won't that result in wash trading? They don't list prices of exchanges who don't charge fees on coinmarketcap for a reason.

I got in on the aircoin ICO.... waiting for the airdrop.

lol, your moon memes are dangerously low dude, you should do something about that..
but in all seriousness, you're saying that because something is illegal (presumably in a handful of countries), its now useless? I think you really have gone to the moon because that logic doesn't work here on planet earth bud.

"the ponzi scheme"
lol, so you've just revealed that you're fundamentally wrong about what this stuff is... I mean sure it could be a fraud, a super long con that is open source, even though its clear not... but a ponzi? Doesn't even fit the basic definition of one.
Tracing someone on a blockchain is easy.... tracing the cash or privacy coins like monero that you can accept for btc is not.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:07:53
it'll be overpriced? sell it..
they'll trace you? lol.. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:57:06


The characeristic of a ponzi scheme is that investors are paid out returns using new investors infused capital instead. It requires lying to everyone about how you operate and fraud and 100% unsustainable.
Bitcoin shares none of these characteristics. The only thing is common is the absurd growth and amount of gains, which may classify it as a bubble.
Calling it a ponzi scheme is obviously harmful to it and blatantly incorrect.  


Would you like it if you ran a legitimite business and someone said you're a nazi who steals from old ladies and you scam all your customers. If you take offense to that, would it make sense for me to say:


The truth is, you say nonsense shit without doing a very basic logic test. You operate on feelings. I do it too sometimes, not judging you lol, just pointing it out.


I can agree with all of that, but would caveat the last sentence. The ability to transact anonymously could be done in a way that is relatively easily. Remember it doesn't have to be perfect and untraceable, just sufficiently hidden to make it uneconomical to pursue anyone that wasn't an outright criminal or terrorist.

No use for t? lol... ok fudbud.
I think you're in the wrong sub.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:21:38
get drunk at the risk of going to jail if caught or know the seed words to a wallet that grows at 100%/year with virtually no risk of jail... hmm, tough choice.
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:48:53
Great predictions... 


@_date: 2017-11-26 17:16:16
You're a fucking visionary man, I will head your advice and short btc probably sometime around the year 2056.
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:07:39
This is the kind of thing that could probably be solved with cryptographic means.... 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:32:07
Eh its the internet, no one should be taking your advice without doing their due dilligence. 
I agree with you though, though its not saying much and btc crashes all the time. I think it will retrace 30%+ at some point and I just hope I can sell before that and buy back in as I do believe in btc and cryptos long term.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:08:53
top 20% pay 95% of all income taxes... bottom 80% who complain about rich people minimizing tax are super greedy.

Faith in crypto son.

It's actually related to living in general, literally a requirement for higher functioning animals.
@_date: 2017-09-22 23:17:43
So why don't you invest in something worth $0.005?
@_date: 2017-09-30 16:55:31
How do you loan out bitcoin that doesn't exist? Doesn't make sense.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:09:58
gold and silver aren't currencies anymore.
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:54:40
I'm sure you'll get an awesome deal for your gold too... and I'm sure you'll get change back.
You can shave off flakes of gold off your 24k bar.
I also hope the somali pirates respect your property rights and don't steal it from you. lol
@_date: 2017-09-22 21:55:01
This is the stupidest answer imaginable. 
These coins are divisible down to like 8 decimals.
@_date: 2017-09-24 14:19:12


My life for Aiur-coin! 
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:26:00
I think that would make them "money" but not necessarily currency.
@_date: 2017-09-22 22:59:38
You're thinking linearly and not geometrically/exponentially/% growth.
By your logic, it would be better if something is worth $5 vs $50, or $0.00000000005 vs $5.
None of that matters of course, because only the percentage difference truly does. There are a few nuances and caveats to that but by and large, no one thinks the way you do in finance, investing, etc. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:19:02


You've just revealed that you're just as stupid and ignorant as the person saying "$8000 is cheap". 
@_date: 2018-02-04 03:15:04


That's about 5 years in crypto time.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:04:21
So then any fiat currency is like 95% virtual then as well... any currencies not virtual?
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:29:47
The mainstream adoption and recognized potential of crypto is like 100x what it was back then.
