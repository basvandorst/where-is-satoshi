Of fucking course.

Yeah, he's a sociopath. A sociopath who now owns a database of most of the world's social interaction (at least it seems that way). Scary.

So then why are you asking questions like "i heard in september it is goin to drop, will you say thats true" and "Will it still be a smart idea to invest today, will it go up?". 
No human has the answer to your questions, and you just admitted that, so what's the point in asking?
@_date: 2017-08-07 04:22:58
Haha, yeah it's totally impossible. You should keep your life savings on there. Since it's impossible to be hacked this is the best thing for you to do with all of your money. /s

The blockchain is going to wipe out their creepy fucking business eventually.
@_date: 2017-08-03 05:13:32
Gotcha, thanks. Should I delete this?

Any idea on when the Ledger native desktop apps may be released?
@_date: 2017-08-21 22:57:25
But don't forget that little shit-head owns Instagram, So he's recording every click and swipe there too!

Ah, thank you!! I was on version 1.8.4 already, but resetting application data made my balance show up again for BTC &amp; BCH.
One bit of confusion I still have, I moved some, but should I move all of my BCH to the "split" address? Will the option to choose between "main" and "split" only be there temporarily?
@_date: 2017-08-03 06:09:18
Thanks again for your help!

Roger Ver's conviction for selling illegal explosives on ebay, and what prominent Bitcoin developers were up to around that same time. I think that would be a great way to start out the discussion.
@_date: 2017-08-20 21:18:28
No need for concern. How many times has the chinese knockoff overtaken the original... in anything?
**Update** Exhibit  
@_date: 2017-08-03 05:25:19
Ok, I will take those steps right now, but you still believe this is the case given the fact that the address with my balance on the UASF &amp; Segwit2x chain is not found on any block explorer?

Have you ever used lmgtfy.com? It's perfect for situations like this.

Shots fired! evoorhees just got ethered! (Jay-Z ethered, not crypto)

ICO's do not only refer to coins that use Ethereum's blockchain. Any coin that uses any blockchain.
@_date: 2017-07-20 06:22:59


You know what currency is used even more widely than Bitcoin for that? The US dollar. This John Crudele is a moron.

Your question is sort of like asking "since we got that new transmission installed in the car, does that mean the car dealership is going to stay open on holidays now?"
@_date: 2017-07-24 21:40:30
You don't need professional legal advice, you need to put some effort into really understanding how to use computers. Consider the current value of your bitcoins as the reward for doing that. Seriously, it's not rocket science to safely use cryptocurrency, you just have to understand what you are doing when using computers &amp; the internet.
There's probably someone in your area that you can pay to train you. If I were you, I'd keep your bitcoin balance a secret, and maybe tell them you want to invest your first £25 into bitcoin and need to learn how. After that, you should be able to safely handle your long lost bitcoin fortune.

You mean the ticketing system already in use at Kraken? You have no clue what you're talking about and it sounds like if you were running a business, you'd just sit on your hands and go "Whoa is me. How is all this work gonna get done? Surely, hiring someone to do it isn't possible. Oh, whoa is me!".
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:23:59
Does anybody know at what point can we withdraw our BTC from our wallets and still retain the BitcoinTrash from the split?

5) For those using a Ledger hardware wallet: 
@_date: 2017-07-23 18:10:20
Its a "her", not "him"!
@_date: 2017-07-15 22:06:14
Finally! Someone that knows what the price will be in the future! You don't know how long I've been trying to find someone like you. I'll be pm'ing you a lot from now on. With your knowledge of the future I will finally be able to get rich!
Thank you in advance!

I'm genuinely curious, why do you hate a website that shows a javascript animation of a user googling something?
@_date: 2017-07-20 05:57:29
Do you have any understanding of the pros and cons of 1mb vs 2mb blocks?
@_date: 2017-07-04 03:43:02
It's always interesting to me when people choose to take a link to lmgtfy as deeply insulting. It says a lot about the person's emotional state when they do.
I understand there are experts in this sub whose brains you'd like to pick, but do you really think they want to have define every term they are using in the process of sharing their expertise? For whatever reason, it didn't occur to the commenter above to simply google the term that they were curious about, so they chose to post the term as a comment and expected someone else to spoon feed the definition to them. Not only is it constructive and helpful to remind them that they have the power to educate themselves when they don't understand a word, but it's about the furthest away one can get from being an "ass" in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-07-20 06:26:40
I think you mean he must be smoking a blunt?
@_date: 2017-07-04 12:32:23
Wow, that's quite a leap. The middle finger means "fuck you". The other is a link to an animation of a google search that is meant to get you to contemplate whether you asked a question that would have made more sense to lookup yourself.
This is pretty much what I was talking about in my other comment above... it says a lot about a person's emotional state when they view a link to a google search as just as insulting as being told "fuck you".
@_date: 2017-07-26 14:18:14
Haha! That was hilarious. Even he can't bring himself to say that he'll sell his Bitcoin for the chinese knockoff BCC, at the same time that he's trying to sell BCC.
This douche is so transparent.

They're called temp agencies. And do you really think their backlog has only been going for a week? You should have asked where to hire and train employees over a 6 month period.
