In all seriousness, ya, get out. Why keep most of your net worth in one of the most volatile markets in recent history (maybe ever). Buy some ETFs, a 401k, pick a few stocks, and put the rest of that in the bank and enjoy your life. You "won", but you aren't a "winner" until you cash (partially) out.

I too find that the best response to a heart felt sentiment, is with a cold slap in the face and a reminder of a bleak reality. And you were able to do it with a dick metaphor. bonus points to you sir
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:56:56

In the past weeks I have seen many dressed in that attire; most smelled like liquor and stared at children a little too long... We need to think outside the box. We need a crypto equivalent to the leprechaun and his gold- pagan wizard of the fiat.

HODL is life, not choice.

I won't count on the media. After the past few weeks of watching it's pretty evident that there is an agenda between the lines but at the same time they have to pay enough homage to maintain audience attention. It's like anti-gun laws (among plenty of other things left or right). The rhetoric that people are allowed to spew on the news is disgustingly ill informed to the point of objective falsehood; and the orator often knows that what they are saying isn't truthful but will be a means to an end. No, I won't trust the media to steer this ship anywhere but where their donors point.

the most pretentious, narcissistic, egomaniacal, POSs. Have you ever noticed how they never are actually going anywhere in life, but they always know best? ... and they always know where and when the party is juuuuuust when I was leaving... end rant sry

seems legit. I'm in. his loss is my hodl
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:04:22
you're looking at this the wrong way. The speculative nature of the currency itself, given the ever- growing diversity of its market, combined with: geopolitical events, cyber attacks, lack of regulation, and a get rich quick investor class rocking the boat for an otherwise stable knowledgable investor class means that I was able to write this incredibly winded post of filibuster nonsense to jokingly tell you to ask Santa for it. Cheers- America
