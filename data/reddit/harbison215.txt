I knew I missed the original boat.  Hindsight is obviously 20/20.  But I figured if enough people had already saw this much value in bitcoin, it may have still been better to get in now than later.  And that sentiment will be correct if by next year or even 2 years from now, bitcoin is up another 100%.  Its a big if and it’s all speculation, but that’s how this works.

I kissed it good by when it left my bank account.  That’s probably my limit so I most likely won’t buy more right now.  I’m just letting it ride.  Best of luck to all of us who have some skin in the game.  Thanks

Plenty of people like this.  I am one of them.  However, like you said, I am not crying about the down turn.  I didn’t think I’d get rich quick.  My contemplation right now is do I buy a little more at the declining value or just hold what I have?  
When I was up 40% in a week I didn’t cash out.  Now that I’m down 40% a month later, why would I cash out now?  Getting in at the right time is a great idea in hindsight, but in the present and future, no one ever knows when the right time is.  They only pretend to.

Seriously.  It makes no sense for a previous bitcoin owner to want people to not buy.  This guy is a fucking dope.  People buying bitcoins is what is driving the price up.  Think the bottom is gonna fall out? Then feel free to cash out.

Buy one... maybe none.  Or sixty-ten-dozen.   Or just in case maybe don’t buy at all.  Trust me.
