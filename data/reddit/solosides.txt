What he's really saying is "our cult the "state" doesnt have control over this thing. And were gonna assume that bitcoin operates with a top-down centralized model because thats all we have ever known our whole lives."
@_date: 2014-01-30 19:36:25
Overstock.com, amazon.com, ebay.com, and even the old Silk Road all represent old world models of centralized digital marketplaces. As you are reading this there are people out there developing decentralized markets that will run just as a mathematical algorithm like bitcoin
edit: And the Fed's $85billion a month driving the price of everything up while eliminating jobs sure doesnt help either

These psychopaths still think they can control a mathematical protocol. Very soon we will free open-source wallets, POS systems, and clients that will make it virtually impossible for the govt to track anyone's transactions.

what do you need "official guidance" for? Do you want them to hold your hand as you take risks in the market?

The total possible number of accounts is 2^160 which is close to the number of atoms in the known universe. And since it takes less than a second to anonymously create a new wallet, how exactly will that be regulated?
@_date: 2014-01-31 17:51:55
exactly like how they ban:
-Smoking pot
-Drinking underage
-Selling drugs
-Pirating software/music/movies
-Driving over the speed limit
-Using fireworks
-Remodeling your house without a license
-Seeing certain websites on the internet (depending on which country youre in)
@_date: 2014-01-31 07:35:16
There's no reason to hold the hands of the worlds most ruthless criminals. Just let them crash and burn because decentralization is the exact polar opposite of their utopia

4: Yes, bitcoins can be lost just like you can lose cash or the bank can "lose" your money to cover their asses
3: Yet there are even more devoted people in the community preventing such attacks
2: How exactly can the IRS or the NSA keep track of my money when I can create an anonymous wallet address in less than a second and the possible number of wallets is equivelant to the number of atoms in the known universe?

You just dont understand how it works. Charlie Shrem is not a member of the guilded class therefore he is subjected to the same rules as the rest of us slaves
@_date: 2014-02-05 21:30:13
and dont forget that websites such as silk road actually provide a useful trade medium and took most of the violence out of the marketplace

hate to break it to you, but bitcoin was invented by and for libertarian anarchists

Not really,
all we really have to lose are all of these psychopath politicians and business men who are all around the world. Sure some of their mansions may be burned down but the general population is not dependent on them in anyway. They are just parasites draining wealth off of legitimate business activities and we would all be much richer without it. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 23:49:07
this just in: psychopaths in suits attempt to declare themselves above the laws of mathematics

All this means is that the first idiots to waste their time and money filling out government paperwork to run a casino are now accepting bitcoin

TLDR: representative of a violent gang says bitcoin is unstable because its not backed by a violent gang

you mean just like the americans and europeans?

They "need" more regulation because government regulations are what makes sure that large vurnerable firms like JP Morgan arent subjected to the rigors of an actual free-market

Wrong, obviously you have never looked at the world of gold mining. Yes there are a few large mining companies and yes mining for gold is extremely risky but there is nothing stopping anyone from taking the risks. Mining companies are also extremely volatile. You can have a company worth millions all of sudden be worth pennies and vice versa


No, my WLAN works like crap, the range is shit and it constantly drops out, thats why I now use a good old fashioned CAT5 cable that hasnt given me any problems. Meshnet hardware developers will be responsible for smoothing these problems out


Obviously you also dont know much about computer science. Bitcoin is currently written with high level programming language which are extremely bloated and inefficient. As the market demands faster confirmations companies will respond with better hardware and software.


Get out from under your rock. Look at how well governments "regulate" illegal drugs


Ill admit I dont know much about namecoin but it will be even better if the next update of the QT client supports the same features.


Once again there will be people specializing in finding solutions to these problems. A private key system would be a hell of a lot of better than trusting the USG and the Diebold Corporation to count your votes.

Mt. GOX is just another poorly managed company. We see this same incompotence in USD centered banks such JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs (except they have the US police and Military backing them). 
But this has nothing to do with the blockchain. GOX is just a petty corporate entity run by incompotent humans wherereas the blockchain is an electronic mathematical ledger stored in millions (soon to be billions) of independent nodes all around the world

A friend asked me what I knew about bitcoin mining. I told him it wasn't worth it unless you have a piece of land with really cheap electricity (like literally being next to the dams in WA state), and are willing to invest $1,000,000+, that you wont get any appreciable return.
Then he told me he wasn't interested in mining himself, he just wanted to get into "mining contracts". I did a mental facepalm of epic proportions.

I could've gotten in at $7, but I was a stupid 19 year old back then. I finally bought 0.02 at $800 and sat on it. Now im leaving 0.01 to sit there, and trading the other half for ETH so that I can take advantage of the rapidly fluctuating BTC/ETH spreads and hopefully turn it into more BTC.

Unfortunately there is a large amount of BTC that is trapped in limbo and will never be accessible by anyone (unless someone invents the ultimate supercomputer that can crack SHA-256 in under a year)

And you need to place those cars as physically close to the cheapest refineries as possible (ala WA state dams and the giant mines next to them)
