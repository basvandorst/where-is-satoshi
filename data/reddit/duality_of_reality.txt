Or, like visa telling overstock they received ¥40 and overstock ignoring that and just assuming they received $40. Big difference, but coinbase doesn’t seem to think it was their fault and Overstock doesn’t think it was their fault either

I would argue that Overstock has more of an agenda since they are holding so much bitcoin (50% of all purchases made with bitcoin is left in bitcoin). So they would benefit from shutting down Bitcoin Cash and growing Bitcoin.
Coinbase on the other hand is trying to be a payment processor for crypto payments for many organizations. Overstock is chump change. They want Amazon, Google, Walmart, etc to start using them. Fucking this up would be a massive blow to their reputation.
We will probably never know which side fucked it up, but since we don’t see this issue with other sites that use coinbase as a payment processor, it really does seem like this was an issue on Overstock’s side, or at least a communication error.

As more miners join, transactions come through faster. The difficulty adjusts to offset this, but only once every two weeks. We recently got a large spike in new miners which caused many more transactions to go through every day, however, when the difficulty adjustments kicks in, this will return to 10 minute blocks again.
The difficulty adjustment should be coming in a day or two:

@_date: 2017-12-27 16:16:43
Really? Isn’t ethereum’s Raiden network literally the same as lightning. Plus there are more long term solutions in the works.
I’m not sure blockchain size is a good comparison. If we wanted to debate based on thag, litecoin’s 12 gb blockchain would be far superior to bitcoin or ethereum. As of now, every ethereum transaction ever made can fit on [an $11 flash drive]( Size and rate of growth need to be addressed, but for the moment there is a huge amount of room to grow before it gets unsustainable.
Ethereum’s network also allowed miners to increase the gas limit to allow for more transactions - something that is not long term sustainable, but at least alleviates some pain for the time-being. So the network was “at a crawl” and had insane $1 transaction fees and 1 hour confirmation times for a couple of days before it was resolved.
In addition, Ethereum’s roadmap and hard fork solution may not be the most elegant, but it’s effective. Everyone in Ethereum knows what they are signing up for and that allows for consensus. If the developers don’t provide a solution that the community likes, they are out just like any other coin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:20:49
I can suggest plenty that are decentralized enough and actually work. Ethereum had nearly 1.1M transactions processed in the last 24h, and yet the fees there are much more manageable.

Couple interesting points to consider, crypto mining thrives on cheap power. Renewables have a big up front cost but are cheap moving forward, in essence Bitcoin can provide an incentive to invest in renewables especially as coal, etc become more expensive into the future.
The power consumption is very high. But at the moment even a nation would have a hard time attacking the network without a significant amount of resources. That is the goal, and there is no added efficiency from adding more miners. That means that the only thing driving more miners will be profitability and the profitability is cut in half every four years. Likely we will not see exponential growth of the power consumption due to this.
It also does have a positive externality that is often overlooked, there is significant money being dumped into advancing the efficiency and computing power of computers for everyone.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:32:39
I’d say this is an accurate summary. Ethereum can do more, but that “more” is also open to having bugs.
If there were a bug in lightning network or segwit or any other piece, I would 100% say it was a fault in Bitcoin, and the same goes for ethereum. However, I’m not sure it’s 100% fair to say that ethereum is flawed because any potential app built on it might have a flaw since anyone could potentially create a dapp with or without peer review (such as with the parity hack)

Sure, currently... What about in the future. it's far easier to determine a Bitcoin was used for an illegal transaction four years ago after finding out a user's address that performed an illegal transaction and finding every single place that Bitcoin went than it is to know which bills were used in an illegal transaction from four years ago.


Because you can misplace your record of your private key, or just remember it, but then if something happens to you it's gone. Far easier to misplace a ledger with $100m of Bitcoin on it than 4,000 lbs of gold


Predictible supply doesn't mean much if the value is changing drastically. This point could easily change in the future if Bitcoin gains adoption and if the price stabalizes a but, but right now if I asked you how many McDonalds hamburgers you could buy in 10 years with $1000, $1000 of gold or $1000 of Bitcoin. The range you would give to be 90% confident is why I ranked these the way I did. If someone gave a range for Bitcoin that wasn't "somewhere between 0 and 10 million burgers, I'd be surprised.


These are fair points, I'll adjust accordingly.

I gave this a shot with a 1-10 scale.
Quality | Gold | USD (cash) | Bitcoin 
:-- | :--: | :--: | :--:
Fungible (one unit is equivalent to any other unit) |10 |9 |7 
Non-consumable (wear and tear/ loss when used and over time) |8 |6 |8 
Portlable (ease of carrying $100M) |3 |4 |9 
Durable (long-term storage and wear and tear if not used) |10 |7 |10 
Divisible |9 |2 |8 
Predictible supply and value |7 |9 |0 
Secure (easy to tell if counterfit) |9 |5 |10
Transactable (can you trade it without relying on anything else) |5 |7 |3 
Sovereign (Government Issued) |No |Yes |No
Reasoning for some items:
Fungability: bitcoin can be traced and blacklisted. Cash potentially could be as well, gold cannot.
Non-consumable: Chemicals can reach gold, money is paper and wears out, Bitcoin has fees and has potential to be sent to the wrong address with no way of recovering it.
Divisible: with accurate enough equipment, gold is near infinitely divisible - even if it would be hard to tell in small quantities. USD go down to cents in physical form and Bitcoin is limited to 1 Satoshi (though a fork could add additional decimals if needed)
Transactable: without internet and power, you have no idea if if you are really getting any amount Bitcoin

and in a deflationary market, it's worse. the poor are forced to spend their money as they get it, the same as in an inflationary market. However, in an inflationary market, they are spending their money when it has the most possible buying power - holding it longer lowers the purchasing power. In deflationary market, the worst time to spend your money is now. This is a huge problem for the poor who need to spend all their income to survive.
That's not all. The rich, who aren't working paycheck to paycheck are able to save some of their income. This is great for them, because in a deflationary economy, it's far better to save. There is **no risk** and you can expect to increase the value of your savings. In contrast, in an inflationary market there is no way for a guaranteed passive increase to buying power.
This is incredibly important. Let's say you are poor and want to borrow $100k for a house. in an inflationary market, we know how this works, you get an interest rate depending on your credit score (obviously simplifying a bit). The interest rate is determined by adding the determined risk rate (chance you won't pay back anything) to the risk-free rate (the rate which the investor is otherwise guaranteed to gain in government bonds, for instance) plus some amount of margin.
The risk-free rate can, in some cases, be lower than the inflation rate, which means investors who want to increase their buying power must take on risk. This is good for borrowers since more capital lending drives interest rates down. In times of economic crisis, the risk-free rate drops and money moves lending markets, giving the poor, and anyone else who needs a loan better rates and stimulates the economy to start moving again.
In a deflationary market, you have a floor, or a minimum on the risk free rate. We know the risk-free rate is at least as high as holding onto your coins, and a rational lender would never lend out coins with the expectation of being returned a negative interest rate. In times of economic crisis, as the true risk-free rate drops, saving becomes relatively more profitable. This means more and more lenders leave the market, starving those who are without savings. This turns into what is well-known as a deflationary spiral. Those with money are incentivized to save it, and those without it no longer can borrow it at a favorable rate.
**TL:DR** a small amount of inflation gives the poor the best fighting chance to eventually come out of poverty, because debts become de-valued over time, and because the best time to spend your money in an inflationary market is now. In a deflationary market, savers (read: the rich) are favored, and the poor are forced to spend money at the worst possible time (now). In times of crisis (recession), inflation incentives the rich to take on risk with their money in order to maintain the buying power of their money, thus lending to the poor at a more favorable rate for the borrower (which is great for the poor and great for getting an economy out of a crisis). In times of crisis for a deflationary market, money moves away from lending, making unfavorable rates for borrowers, and thus perpetuating the recession further.
It is worth noting that deflation, does stave off hyperinflation, which is good, but requires an entirely different conversation.

Whoa let's pause here for a moment. In Fiat systems with inflation, money must be actively invested in order to grow. As more money is printed, it devalues the money that is currently out there. (This seems to be understood here)
In a deflationary system, like Bitcoin, wealth gains value simply by holding it. No active investing is needed.
In what universe is it better for the top 1% to do nothing in order to grow wealth versus requiring them to actively invest to grow.
It seems people here are not arguing for a better system of redistributing wealth. Rather, they just want to switch out who the 1% is and hope to ride that bandwagon up, screwing over those who can't afford to spend money on Bitcoin in the process (the 90%)

That’s fair. I could also see an issue if one party finds out that the other party is out of btc in their account (and therefor can’t send a justice transaction) or if one party knows the other is unable to post a transaction for some reason (say one part slips into a coma for a month)
I’m not sure I like the idea of having to constantly check that the other party was trustworthy.
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:25:41
What about proof of stake? It would require a random lottery which decides which node’s proposed block is the next in the chain and node’s chances of being picked are based on the amount staked. In order to pull off a 51% attack you’d need to hold more than half of the total amount staked. Since attacking like this would likely dramatically affect the price once people realize that an attack is taking place, the group set to lose the most would be the attacker since they would need to stake more than half of the total amount staked.
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:15:32
Does that really get to the root of the issue though? Let me know if I’m misunderstanding this.
The whole point is to not need trust. If we each start with 1 btc, then you send me 1 btc, then I send you 2 btc and then post the old transaction where I had 2 btc, you rightfully own 2 btc and are now forced to post a transaction to the network for a fee just to get what you should be owed. If I’m successful I get 2 btc minus the transaction cost, and if I fail I’m out the fee only. On the other hand, in this example, you are either out 2 btc or you are out a transaction fee. What’s to stop a malicious actor from forcing you to pay transaction fees, regardless of what it costs them

I appreciate the reply, I’ll take some time to look this over when I have a chance.
What I have read so far, I agree with. Perhaps nothing is cheaper, but I’m not sure that’s the argument. I think the argument is that maybe there is a way to keep fees small and keep the network secure. Plus mining (using electricity and buying mining equipment) has negative externalities on the environment that are not really accounted for. PoS may not be cheaper (it’ll have the same opportunity cost to society) but perhaps we can remove some of the negative externalities

I agree that a hard fork to correct a hack should not be the way to do things, but let me add a little background.
Ethereum intended to go to PoS since it started. It was on the road map from it’s release. With PoS, the blockchain is secured by those who own tokens. It in not acceptable for a malicious party to own 20% of all coins in a PoS system.
In Ethereum’s case they didn’t have much of a choice

Multiply all my numbers by 20 and the math is still the same.
The point is simply if you require multiple years of price increase to make money, sure that can happen, but it’s definitely far riskier to invest up front in mining equipment. Bitcoin is far more liquid than an S9. If the price of Bitcoin doubles tomorrow I can sell my BTC for a profit, if it drops I can leave the market. With an S9, doing so will likely result in some level of a loss since the S9 is no longer “new”  and I have to search for a buyer and possibly pay for shipping

@_date: 2018-02-06 15:43:36
Sure that’s perfectly valid if you have no upfront cost and no upkeep costs, but these things cost something to buy. $2,300 a piece for an S9 in fact.
So let’s say you have $2,300 right now. You can buy bitcoin or buy an S9. Let’s say there are three possibilities over the next year:
 1 Price goes up
You bought your S9 today, and get it in 30-90 days and get it fired up. By that time the difficulty has increased [25-70%]( but that’s ok the price of a bitcoin is back up to an all time high and you start mining (I’ll be generous and say you get your S9 in 30 days, the price of Bitcoin is $20,000 and the difficulty only increased 25% - it would likely be higher if the price increased significantly). You get  $21 per day and paying $5 in electricity. By the end of the year you have  $5,360 (after accounting for the loss of 30 days waiting for the S9 and both price and difficulty rose in tandem, which would end the year at 3x our previous ATH to be $60,000 (last year the difficulty rose more than 8x)
On the other hand, your $2,300 invested today at $7,000 is worth $19,000 in this scenario.
2 Price remains relatively constant
Same situation except the price remains constant. You get your S9 in 30 days and mine with the difficulty 20% higher. You make $8 per day and pay $5 in electricity. Once the difficulty is double the rate today you realize that you are paying more in electricity than you are making mining. This happens after 4-8 months and you stop mining. So at most you make $730 (and remember you paid for that S9)
Alternatively if you invest $2,300 you have $2,300 if the price is relatively constant
3 Price continues down.
You buy an S9, it comes in 30 days, Bitcoin is worth $2000 now and you begin to mine - except you don’t because electricity costs too much. You are out $2,300 from buying the S9.
 Your $2,300 is now worth $660
In all three scenarios investing makes more sense than buying a miner. The only exception is if the price goes up faster than the difficulty and you mine for more than a year

I think that’s obviously true if you already have the equipment. Not so much if you don’t have it, unless you have incredibly cheap electricity because you could find that it isn’t profitable to mine once you receive your S9
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:39:07
Which results in less transactions on chain. Bitcoin’s protocol didn’t change, people are just using it differently...
In other words, the person you replied to is technically correct - less transactions on chain and Bitcoin has not been “fixed” if we see similar numbers of on chain transactions as we saw in December, we’d quickly see the same high fees again.

Fill me in if Im off the Mark here, but there is no reason fractional reserve banking doesn't work in crypto.
Let's say you have a money custodian, coinbase for the sake of example. Coinbase agrees to give you back your Bitcoin when asked (just like a bank). However, since they have a significant amount of Bitcoin, they can reasonably assume that not everyone will request it all back at once. Really they only need to hold onto a fraction of that amount in Bitcoin and the rest they can lend out. By lending out your Bitcoin they can get paid in interest on loans they make, and can even off you an interest rate on your Bitcoin.
Let's say me and 20 others each have 1 Bitcoin and I give it to coinbase to hold on to, and that is the entire Bitcoin money supply. Right then you have a total of 21 Bitcoin. You want Bitcoin as a part of a loan, so you go to coinbase and ask for 5 Bitcoin and agree to pay back 6 Bitcoin in the future. Me and the 20 others still each have 1 Bitcoin each, but now you also have 5 Bitcoin and all of a sudden the money supply was increased.
So yes, a third party can increase the money supply through fractional reserve banking.
One argument against this is, well I would never let coinbase hold onto my Bitcoin! Ok well that is you, and we are expecting worldwide adoption right? My grandmother doesnt know how to log into Facebook. Do you think she will be storing her own private keys? Banks and investment companies don't want and can't afford the level of physical security needed to safely store private keys. All of that money will be looking for a money custodian. And all of the money stored with a custodian could potentially allow for fractional reserve banking
@_date: 2018-04-25 17:26:49
Perhaps, but with hopefully sometime in the future where property ownership is stored on the blockchain and contracts being possible to allow lending functionality, (suchas asset clawback when there is a failure to pay) that should allow "Bitcoin Banks™" to have a very transparent balance sheet to prove that they have the money available. (Which was the issue with bank runs)

Generalizing a lot here, but I am trying to be fairly neutral with my response:
BTC believes in offchain scaling, Lighting Network and smaller block sizes (and more efficient use of that block size), and generally thinks that any pain today (from high fees, slow transaction times, etc) are worth it now (read: early stage adoption) in order to have a leaner, more efficient chain in the future.
BCH largely sees the limiting of blocksizes as an artificial cap in order to make fees higher and allow the core team to push the lightning network. BCH has larger blocks that are used less efficiently (no segwit) which has relieved the pain now (really low fees, faster transaction times during times of congestion, etc and does not have "replace by fee" which makes 0-confirmation transactions viable). BCH supporters see storage space as cheap (who cares if the blockchain is 4tb if you can buy an 8tb drive for $150) and feels that networking will continue to evolve to easily handle large blocks in the future, so there isn't a need for almost-mandatory complex offchain solutions in order to use the blockchain.
They are both splits from the same chain in August 2017, and both are different from the original Bitcoin whitepaper, so neither has a claim to the name besides adoption. In general, the most used chain has the name. The most used chain is not Bitcoin Cash by any measure, and trying to argue so makes you look like an idiot. But if at some point in the future BCH overtakes BTC and it doesn't appear to be contested, I don't see why BCH wouldn't be referred to as Bitcoin at that point. (But that would need to happen first)
Basically it boils down to off chain scaling (BTC) versus on chain scaling (BCH).
Calling Bitcoin Cash Bitcoin is roughly as stupid as calling Bitcoin Cash bcash. Just call each what they are.
Full disclosure: I've held both BTC and BCH in the past but do not hold any of either right now
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:24:41
Maybe I'm wrong here, but I thought that segwit was adopted in tandem with a block size increase down the road and at that point not many supported BCH. The 2x fork was turned down in November, and that's when BCH gained some actual support. Because that half of the compromise was not allowed to go through. So it's a bit more complex then saying the fork was voted against in August
@_date: 2018-04-27 19:16:59
I used to be solidly on the BCH side, mainly because I did (and still do believe) that we need on chain scaling and low fees, that soft forks are messier than hard forks (and can be done without consensus) and that so far lightning has been coming soon™ for years and still seems to be too early in development.
That said, the BCH side has gone full circle jerk regarding the whole "true Bitcoin" thing to the point of being manipulative and dishonest. I didn't want to be a part of that. I'm not a fan of Ver and how he handles things. If BCH was able to throw him off the self-proclaimed throne and drop the bullshit then maybe there would be a chance for the two to coexist or even for BCH to take over at some point (if lightning fails, for example). But with current tragectory I don't see that happening.
