That make sense. It did not cross my mind before. I am not that technical, isnt authy is only for 2FA? The ttransactions are signed using multisig key from bitfinix, bitgo and the client. I think multisig is provided by BIP-11 or BIp-16. I could be wrong.

Bitgo is responsible no doubt. 
I wonder how they got both the keys from bitfinix and bitgo. Could be an insider. 
The whole fiasco is very suspicious. Price started to decline few days before the hack. There was a huge dump on bitfinix bringing the price from $655 to $633. Both days before the hack Bitfinix volume was above $30 mil. 
very suspicious.

That happens when the price is going up.. didn't you notice untill now?

I do not think there is much to do with EU. Bitstamp volume is 3.91mm in last 24 hrs where as bitfinix has 23.14mm. So there is more to do with china than anything else. I think it has more to do with CNY value.

Not all EU states have Euro. Denmark and sweden still uses Krone. Britain using pounds. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 13:40:05
Sorry, what does that mean?
@_date: 2016-06-22 23:56:33
yes.. if everyone holds, price goes up.. 
@_date: 2016-06-22 23:58:32
no logic.. people are afraid of loosing more and dumping..  dump = drop.. 
If every one holds.. price would go up automatically. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 00:02:34
there will always be some one selling it... I mean, more demand less supply would increase the price..

They did not make enough money from bitcoin community. Now, they are getting paid from R3 and the bankers. and  doing their best to bring down Bitcoin.

If you think about it, even comapny stocks has no use other than trade. You get devidents and most of the time very little. 
Most of the investments are for making more money.

Halving hype is over in my opnion. 
This time.. It's bitfinix. Also coindesk, they did their best to bring down bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 00:10:27
I just bought some at $581 and now It's $599.
@_date: 2016-06-22 23:07:38
$300 is bit too much.. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 00:06:15
looks like your prediction was right. lets see what happens in next few hours.
@_date: 2016-06-22 23:00:55
I dont think so.. look at the amount being dumped at the moment. it's a fear market.. it will go down to $450 in a day or two.. then it will stay there.. and it will be slow decline market from there.. 2014 again..

Half of turkey is still in Europe. The European Union (EU) is a politico-economic union of 28 member states that are located primarily in Europe.
There are many countries in europe which are not in the union.

I can do cash transcation in person, in Nepal ( Kathmandu ), most probably in your home. Please reply to my PM. 
It's easy. Download any bitcoin wallet on your phone or computer. Make sure to meet up in a place with wifi or your phone have data. We will count the money, see if every thing is ok. You send your bitcoin address to the seller, seller releases the coins. Then you verify your address on blockchain.info.. wait, have a coffee and chit chat until you get one confirmation seller takes the money and coins are all yours.
Easy. hope to hear from you.
