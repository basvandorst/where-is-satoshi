how do you know that NOBODY ELSE knows about it?  just based on what's available online now?  perhaps a small but significant number know but are held to privacy on the matter

has there ever been a gov't who has issued two currencies?  how inconvenient either to vendors who all have to accept both currencies or customers who have to carry both currencies.  otherwise the economy becomes fragmented to the two monetary systems.

I don’t believe him because losing 10 billion dollars is not something you just brush off and write a blog about to share with the world.  Most people would be totally devastated especially if you were the person who invented such an earth shattering new technology.  Oh, and also he has no proof..

Anybody can guess what size trade it takes to move Bitcoin by $20?  Looking at Poloniex chart there was about 100-200 BTC volume around when the price went up.  Is that all it takes to move Bitcoin?
