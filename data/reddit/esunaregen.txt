I think the general public doesn't understand that we have to ask for and have permission to use our own money when we put it in a bank... Our money isn't really ours..

Invest in Bitcoin and learn about it's underlying technology. Buy the dips, ignore the FUD, HODL.

I'm going to ask a really really noob question here, but how am I supposed to read this chart? I want to understand moon math~
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:10:33

LOL you guys are such noobs. Just HODL. Bitcoin ain't going to 5000. Look at the number of people waiting for a dip below 7k waiting to buy. That's everyone. Everyone is waiting, locked and loaded and hungry af. 
After the fork, people are going to dump their 2x and it's going where? Yeah, back into BTC. The price is going to shoot upward because everyone will be buying. You guys are weak hands and I'm glad you're considering selling. If you can't handle the 10 percent drops (and seriously, LOL at 10 percent), you don't deserve Bitcoin gains.

the tension is so thick you could cut it with a knife
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:42:13
so good to be right LOL! 
the main poster even deleted his post. Even though I was downvoted, I hope that I instilled SOME amount of strength and kept at least one person from selling their sweet, sweet BTC. 
At the time of this post, we are at 7.2k boys. HODL! You gonna' be alright.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:37:09

You sir, are an incredible boss but more than that, an incredible human being. 
One that really cares for your employees! Not only gifting them BOTH bitcoin and a hardware wallet, but also teaching them on the basics?! You must really care and really love people. We need more humans like you- ones who are not only passionate, but do something about it. You are a force for good, man. 
This really brightens up my day.
Especially in a world where it's so easy to lose hope and become jaded, this is a great reminder that you don't need to break down the entire wall, just remove one brick and light can pierce through. You da real mvp, bro. What a boss- pun intended.

Let's goooo

you just gotta go through the process of going from weak to strong and that process is like anything in life- no discipline feels fun. 
No diet, no exercise plan, no learning some new skill or hobby, nothing worth doing is going to be completely pain free. It's like learning to play the guitar. Your fingers get calloused and it hurts. But it's what you must go through if you are going to ever do anything on that instrument. It's like a rite of passage. 
hodling during a dip is just hardening and callousing your sweet summer crypto fingers so as to play beautiful music on that bitcoin guitar   
I got in at 4700 and it wasn't easy to hodl. Not at all. But I had to keep telling myself that I believe bitcoin will go way past 5k and that the price point I entered in will be considered extremely cheap and lucky by many others in even just a year. 
you have to fight the urge to allow your present FUD to speak louder than the future moon.

I had to reinstall for it to work but no issues at all now! I kept trying to do it by myself on excel but I am a caveman. Thank you!
