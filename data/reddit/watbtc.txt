Wow, this is just what I was looking for! Thanks a ton, OP.

They're keeping the riff raff out. I wouldn't have it any other way.

I think we would say "Altogether now and sell...." hours after the split.
There's far more of us than there are of BU folks; by orders of magnitude. Even if every last one of them tried to sell their "core coins" we'd reduce theirs to 0 within minutes of that push.
Anyway, exchanges don't want that much drama; it's not clear that they'd want to issue any BUTTs (Bitcoin Unlimited Temporary Tokens) at all, and there are good reasons to think that they won't.

Haha, it wouldn't take much of his stash.
Nor ours.

Whoosh yourself. 
They're all on his twitter feed.

The last point is one I can't agree with because many of us do it for reasons other than greed, including ideological ones.
If you truly knew how much death and evil is behind the fiat dollar you'd try to recreate that scene from Batman returns where the joker burns billions...
@_date: 2017-03-14 05:56:48
...Not if you took it from the evil ones.

Increase in volatility? I hope you mean short-term, because it's well proven and accepted by now that as the market cap grows, the volatility is diving.

Who has time to add the 108 segwit supporting companies listed here:

Nope, very prescient prediction again.
@_date: 2017-03-14 02:34:32
Ok, but how? Can we force them to fork soon? 
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:25:04
I shouldn't take credit for that... I saw someone else around here use it first.
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:27:31
You completely misunderstand. I'm in bitcoin because I love money. I'd like to own quite a lot of it, in fact.
Fiat dollars are extremely dirty money. The evils paid for with it are off-the-charts evil, and it was printed out of nothing to enable that evil. 
Nothing would make me more proud of humanity for them to pile it all up in a big stack and set it ablaze. 
@_date: 2017-04-13 00:45:09
I'd go for that. Brilliant.

I heard his degrees were all plagiarized as well.

Their business model is all about fraud. Like any strong business, they need to try out all the different kinds of fraud to make sure they're getting the most fraud for their effort.
@_date: 2018-04-11 22:41:13
Sounds Keynesian.
@_date: 2018-04-11 22:36:21
This line of thinking is very insensitive to those who never receive fiat in the first place. You can't buy it back if you have no cash to buy with.

Has Samsung made any kind of statement about producing chips for crypto mining?

72 is nothing for japan... They often get hundreds a day to sign up, but the whole country isn't getting 100's a day paying in BTC yet. 
Why would they? It only makes sense to stack coins and offload their yen.
@_date: 2017-05-18 17:33:58
You seem to forget that contention happened since those olden days.
@_date: 2017-05-19 22:28:57
"Gambling" eh? I like these odds then...  6 of the last 7 years it's paid off better than any other currency has.
Is it so hard to admit that there may be a good reason for bitcoin's awesome performance? Maybe people actually find value in the unique features that bitcoin offers? Kinda like they did in gold, one might say?

Fun fact about Assange and Bitcoin:
He wasn't just any cypherpunk; one of his creations, the Rubber Hose file system, was an inspiration for all these wallets today that let you use a "duress pin" so you can show agents and robbers a seperate wallet with a small balance if held up.
Thanks Assange!

Um, that's what it says. The addresses where the coins are *is* a real-time list of unconfirmed transactions.
That's really all bitcoins are. They don't exist in any other form.
@_date: 2017-05-19 20:40:29
Would you have been a sucker to take out your retirement investments and other traditional financial investments last week and spend them on Bitcoin before your stock market collapsed?
Or at any point in the last year?
@_date: 2017-06-08 09:47:24
On average a currency has collapsed every 3 years somewhere in the world. We just have to ensure Bitcoin scales while staying the most liquid crypto by that time, and we are guaranteed to see it happen. Without fail.
That's why I hate it when I see other cryptos get direct access to fiat cash like some big exchanges now do. Technically, if bitcoin lags behind because of the scaling war, some crappy altcoin could surpass it and grab that important event in history... That'll probably kill bitcoin overnight. (And the world would be far worse off adopting that far-less-developed coin.)
@_date: 2017-06-08 18:44:07


No, not even remotely.
Read the benefits page for Segwit and you'll soon be optimistic at all the other scaling benefits that Bitcoin will receive post-segwit. Not only will the block size increase be closer to 3MB in practice, but Schnorr signatures, MAST, and most importantly, the TxMal fix giving us access to proper off-chain scaling are pretty extreme upgrades that can't be counted in mere Megabyte terms of a block size increase.
Layers 2 and up will literally get us to full, global transactions one day, even if that's 1 million tps. The innovation of the whole world is allowed to work on scaling solutions, permissionlessly, on that level... Once TxMal is solved.

Why are you asking? Do you think he has the power, or any dev for that matter, to stop the unstoppable?
@_date: 2017-06-08 08:39:13
Which means that he was also conveniently missing during the time Satoshi was active... Let's not go around bashing someone with unique qualifications to be Satoshi because of the cover story.
@_date: 2017-06-08 18:36:19
Not really; coins are built differently, so large swaths of upgrades for bitcoin won't work in most other coins. For instance, Litecoin has different block times and Scrypt for a mining algo, so anything in its code that touches those two areas can't be upgraded with Bitcoin's improvements.
@_date: 2017-06-08 09:38:53
And it still can with lightning and other higher-layer solutions.
