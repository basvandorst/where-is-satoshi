EC is a temporary measure (redundant even) before TF is implemented.

NXT is not prone to 51% attacks. You should put half of your fiat into NXT, Peter, and thank me next year :)

You can't have 51%. As well as TF will take care of 51% in an unlikely case someone buys up 51% of all NXTs.

You can't really duplicate PoS coins in the same network or it would be a different PoS coin - same rule applies. Both PoW and PoS are not backed by any hashrate though, but by people using them. PoW hashrate or staking hashrate in PoS is important, but only demand can give value to money, demand is what backs money.

You mean if 51% of all NXT coins are leased to your forging pool? What incentive would you offer to attract that much balance? There is a competition among pools and large stakeholders (the largest pool generates ~11.3% of all blocks at the moment), here is the graph:
besides, as you can see from the link below, many forgers do solo forging (over 300 accounts have successfully forged blocks over the last 10 000 blocks with their respective effective balances):
there is one chance in million you can attract 51% effective balance to your pool. If you plan to do that, you'd have to do that before Transparent Forging is implemented, because when it is, the 51% effective balance won't matter. NXT is as decentralized as can be, certainly more decentralized than PoW cryptos.

I've had good experience using the NXT decentralized exchange. That, and the NXT multigateway that allows almost trustless exchange of NXT&lt;-&gt;other crypto currencies is a game changer.
The best part about decentralized exchanges is that you don't have to worry about your funds being stolen or frozen. On a centralized exchange it's always an issue, and it's a constant worry resulting in rushing trading and hasty withdrawal of funds. It's been a breezer to trade on NXT dex, I basically set the buy or sell order where I want and I don't care to leave it there as long as needed. I know that the decentralized exchange is not going anywhere, while I don't have that kind of certainty with centralized ones.

Nobody can have a 51% stake in NXT, as this will drive the price sky-high, buying 1-2% (10-20 mln.) of all NXTs in existance doubles the price. To attack bitcoin you only need to coerce 1-2 pool operators to do what you want them to, I imagine there are enough powerful entities that can do that. Not to mention when Transparent Forging is implemented in NXT, you will have to have over 90% of all NXTs to make a successful attack.

You're wrong. "Fiat" is literally "because I said so", backed up by a state power which forces people of the state to accept that fiat. Nobody forces you to accept a PoS crypto currency. You are free to call it pre-mined. However, calling it fiat is nonsense and doesn't fit the definition of fiat.

Your private chain and transactions within the blocks you generate on the private chain will not be accepted by other nodes. It's a misconception that there is a 'nothing at stake' issue touted by PoW miners. Please welcome to nxtforum.org to debate this issue in detail.

That's why I said almost :)
MGW is not fully trustless, but it's more trustless than centralized exchanges. Regulations can be avoided by operating from a different country, I believe.
As for the decentralized exchange itself, where you can trade shares/tokens of a business, it's fully trustless. You only have to trust the issuer of the tokens, of course.
Sure, there is no ideal solution for all these issues, but it's much better than centralized exchanges and centralized websites for trading shares.

Exactly. I've read it and there are no facts in this 'paper', only guesstimates.
@_date: 2015-01-09 07:24:01
You haven't posted a single fact.
Feel free to educate yourself and read facts on PoS here:
