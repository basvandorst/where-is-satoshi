Did you really just dodge a direct question from a potential customer?
You claim your offering will be so much better than Ripple that you don't even consider Ripple a real competitor (or at least, you seem to be staying that). So the question is: what *specifically* makes that true?

Sounds pretty cool. Will look forward to tracking your progress!

Heh, how many implementations is this now? 5? 6?  Gonna be a ride!  Much more momentum than back in 2005 ;)

I think most people take the analogies we use to describe technology, and they think that somehow they are more real than they are.  So people think you could build a cryptocurrency where "mining" was based on work done in the real world (that can't be cryptographically proven) or that we could move fiat without a TTP.  It's very difficult to get people over their idea that everything is the same.

You should be able to enter a BTC address on the "send" page of the client and just send the BTC out.

I'd be interested to hear what you mean by "incentives-compatible"

It looks like a subset of ripple's functionality, though.  Just because it's technologically different from the now-most-famous ripple implementation doesn't mean it's not of interest to ripplers.

Yes, the ripple project predates bitcoin.  This latest tech on ripple.com is new, and is the first serious attempt to make it decentralised (though we've all wanted that for years).  Check out ripplepay.com and villages.cc for more established systems.
One other thing, you don't really implicity trust down the chain... you just owe the peson who trusted you, and the person you pay is owed by someone they trust.  Everyone along the chain is both owed and owes, so that just works out.

During the beta, they're giving them away on the bitcointalk forums.  If you don't have a long-standing account there many people in the community (including myself) are willing to lend the starter amount until you can buy some inside the system.

The social lending angle is the way us lont-tine users have viewed the project for years.  The possibility of bank-like gateways was always known, but thought of as a fringe case.  The new implementation turns that messaging on its head, but of course both are still possible.

Except that we've had a centralized ripple server at ripplepay.com for years.  The whole point of this new work is to decentralize it.

That's not even the case most of the time.  Except for transaction fees, XRP need never be held or transmitted at all.

This is super evil.
