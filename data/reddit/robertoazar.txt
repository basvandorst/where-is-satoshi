Bitcoin wont eve achieve mass adoption if transactions take 30 minutes or more with increasingly higher fees and the impossibility of micro transactions

Why is it a scam exactly? My friend wants to invest some money into it but it seems shady to me... Can you explain why it is a scam please?

Yeah, I kinda knew that from before. The reason is that it is just not profitable. I know the most respectable cloud mining service is genesis-mining but even with them, when I invested I just barely made my return but that's because the price of Bitcoin went up!
I just wanted to know you guys experience with this one... I have reason to believe that it's some kind of pyramid scheme but I'm collecting evidence so that my friend doesn't end up investing in that nonsense.

Some of these guys are saying that if you invest 100k USD with them, within 18 months you will have made 300k USD... 
I am just wary, I feel like the numbers don't add up.

I wonder how they would be able to enforce this law... Really sad though, Colombia has many ridiculous laws. 
C'mon Colombia you can do better!
