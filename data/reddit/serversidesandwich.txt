There is indeed!  Also btw your other comics are great!  I just hate this subs elitist attitude to other types of crypto-currency.

Don't know why the downvotes.  mcxNOW is the by the far the fastest/most secure exchange in the industry.  Realsolid can be a character at times and the fee fiasco was unsavoury, but you shouldn't be downvoted for mentioning it.  Some of these new users need to read the reddiquette.

Not so funny now, eh btc?

Yep, it's an awful site and really they screw over the freelancers.  When you just want to make a reasonable living they squeeze you for everything you have got by luring you stupid badges and prizes.
The whole experience for me basically played out like a facebook game with XP+1 here and pay-for-higher-exposure there.  Ugh, I'm glad I quit that joke of a company.

I ~~suppose~~ think you are right.  If I do work at the rate now convert to US dollar it would be worth more in the long haul when it goes up.
My only concern is that the fluctuation, but i'm just happy at the minute to build up my portfolio whilst making some BTC.

I think it will.  Wrote my comment just after I glanced at the rate! :P

After working for some bitcoins just 1 day ago (design), this makes me very sad. :(  Its gonna be hard motivation to keep going.
