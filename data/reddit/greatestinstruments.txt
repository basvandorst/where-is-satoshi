I think our misunderstanding is semantic. I'm describing an underlying reality - *debt increases faster than taxes.* You can choose to address this reality or not - but it goes against the notion you asserted that *taxes pay for everything*.

Many disciplines (economics is *infamous* for this) use jargon to simplify or (sometimes) complexify the underlying reality.

This is a continuation of: [Part 1 - Breaking The Fourth Monopoly - How A Decentralized, Digital Economy Challenges The Power Of Central Banking](
**TL; DR Summary:**
Political power is derived from four monopolies:
* Knowledge
* Violence
* Land (Resources)
* Currency
The first is under siege from various elements of the Internet: Alternative media, social media, and online activism - shifting public opinion. Big data and blanket surveillance - attempts to regain the upper hand - are falling short of their designed expectations.
This is because the internet offers a low-cost path of least resistance, for information to escape...
Labor and capital are following suit through an emerging, digital economy.
Banking dynasties such as the House Of Medici (in Florence) owed their success to several innovations:
* Counterfeit-resistant bills of exchange.
* A double-entry ledger system for tracking and error-checking.
* A universal clearing house to quickly resolve payments.
Cryptocurrency threatens the fourth monopoly by replacing and improving upon all of these through a decentralized protocol.
Capital centers have shifted throughout history:
Sumeria -&gt; Egypt -&gt; Greece -&gt; Italy -&gt; Germany -&gt; Paris -&gt; London -&gt; New York

The optimal strategy of a deflationary currency is *different*. 
It's also breakable into tiny units.
With dollars, I can spend no less than a cent (.01). With Bitcoin, I can spend as little as 0.00000001.
Lets say I buy 100 coins, and the rate of deflation is 3%. I spend 1 coin, (1%), on a laptop.
A year from now, I have 99 coins, and a laptop, but my 99 coins are worth more in dollars than my 100 coins were a year ago, due to deflation.
A year from now, my investment is worth 2% more than I started with, and I got a *free* laptop.
With a deflationary currency, you have to *spend it like one*.

For you, *personally*. It's potentially harmful to the *market in which you operate* if the market stagnates due to hoarding. Which is the institutional argument against *deflationary* currencies, is their causing precisely this effect.
Someone has to spend money or the market collapses. I understand that not everyone thinks in the manner of the example, but it only takes a few doing so to make a difference.
It's not necessary to argue, just see the point for what it is...
An example of using a deflationary currency to benefit from the deflation, while not completely stagnating the market. If deflationary currencies succeed, it will be through use of this principle (even if unknowingly in some cases). 


But obviously not *never* because the money is no good to you if you *never* spend it. A rational approach would be to spend regularly, but check your spending against the rate of deflation and try to keep it *under* that rate.


You forfeit the *opportunity cost* of the use of the laptop for the time you would have had it. The laptop is an example, but it's a stand in for *whatever* you would need or want. Replace laptop with *food*, *rent* or something else that's one of your top 5 expenses. Would you not eat for 6 months, to buy twice as much food later? Not pay rent for 6 months, to pay it twice as cheaply later? It sounds great as an *economic theory* example, but when we try to not spend money in the real world, we run into needs and wants we're not willing (or can't) go without.

Obligatory TL;DR
* Networks are not actually a human invention - slime molds and other collaborative organisms have been building network structures for billions of years.
* Networked entities survive by adopting collaborative behaviors - aligning individual and group objectives.
* Humans have been organizing as *hierarchies* for thousands of years. It was all we had. Yet, now we suddenly find ourselves with wide-scale access to a *networked* approach. 
* Online collectives have a lot in common, structurally and behaviorally, with slime molds.
* Centralized agencies (such as governments) are still stumbling over how to deal with these kinds of entities.
* We are in the midst of a paradigm shift, as the influence of decentralized collectives moves from the dark corners of the internet, and into mainstream business and technology.
* Decentralized Autonomous Corporations, such as Bitcoin, are beginning to gather mainstream attention and support.
* Advanced programmable versions of this concept, such as [Ethereum]( promise to take these ideas to the next level.
* Those who can learn to *think as a network* will reap the greatest advantages of this shift.

The government's income doesn't really come from taxes. It comes from raising the National Debt (aka "printing money").
The taxes are only the *security* on the loan, as long as the government prints more than they tax. Which has been every year since 1913.
You're not totally wrong, but it's more complex than "taxes pay for everything." - more accurate would be "taxes secure the loan on everything."

The protocol in question is less important than how many other layers are built on top of it.
IPv4 is proving to be difficult to displace because of the sheer number of other applications and tools that use it as their foundation - not to mention the training investment the industry has in it.
IPv6 is just now beginning to have enough "ooh aah" features to entice adoption. Ironically, its largest adopters are overseas entities who can't afford to buy v4 address space (Bitcoin finds adoption overseas for similar reasons).
The U.S. Government has set (and failed to meet) several adoption timelines for v6. This is partly due to expense, but mostly because signing off on the project would be such a colossal risk. Far lesser projects have ended careers...

* The tension created by this dynamic not only hinders economic growth in the third world, it has boiled over into unrest and chaos - "Arab Spring" being a prime example.
* World-recognized economist Hernando De Soto Polar has waged a multi-decade campaign to elevate third-world economies by easing their access to property rights.

One of the best parts of all this is meeting some interesting people with different ideas.  
I took a quick look, and I am fascinated. I will have to do some reading. Let me know when you finish your book. 


I liked your suggestion. I have edited it into the article.

Austin would be an awesome spot for a billboard or mural. Lot of techie folks there. I believe their Bitcoin Meetup is one of the bigger ones in TX.

I've never used it, but I haven't heard any major complaints about it. I know that a lot of gamers who can't get credit cards (or don't want to) use it to pay for their online gaming accounts.

I tend to agree. The market is strong enough at this point to stand on its own. I think 3 years ago, this would have been a huge blow, now it's more like a small speedbump.

For some things, yes. But it still has its niche. I predict that eventually, cryptocurrencies will be tied to certain niches, such as industries, communities, or to advance a particular idea. Who says you have to limit yourself to just one?
Cryptocurrencies will become as specialized as any other piece of technology.
@_date: 2013-06-27 02:38:01
This is true.
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:26:00
It's a massive, coordinated Social Media blast.
@_date: 2013-09-11 23:21:51
I have no affiliation with this site, but I liked the layout, and some of the features. 
Looks promising.
@_date: 2013-09-24 01:14:16
That's some pretty crazy advice. Where did you get it?
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:00:52
Thanks! The camaraderie of this community is outstanding.
I'm more of a scotch drinker, but this weekend, the beer shall be in your honor!
Thanks to everyone for the positive feedback. I haven't been on Reddit as much these days, please feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter]( (I'm on this one more) or [Facebook]( ( (I don't use it as much, and I need to update it more often).
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:24:33
I will check them out. I did enjoy [Bitcoin And The Three Laws of Robotics]( on [Let's Talk Bitcoin!]( where I also had an article republished: [Money's Future May Lie In Its Past](
The *meeting of the minds* is an important phase.

He is factually correct about the price decline. However, if you follow his articles, you would notice he almost always argues for the status quo from an "appeal to authority" stance. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:31:30
Seriously, how did my picture get on here!? 
@_date: 2013-07-29 23:27:34
Pic unrelated?

The Russian version of PayPal, [WebMoney]( is accepting BTC already.

"The government will just ban it!" Said every idiot that doesnt understand human nature. The government *can't even keep drugs out of prisons.*

The Law of Accelerating Returns applies, creating a positive feedback loop between Bitcoin being talked about and adopted.

Nothing is too soon in the middle of a global currency war. With China opening exchanges, the west will have to follow suit.
@_date: 2013-10-26 22:15:11
This is pretty funny.
That said, a serious point:
I see a lot of guys try to "sell" people on Bitcoin by rationally arguing the mechanics of it to them. 
Most of us are probably ENTJ/INTJ types who *ourselves* respond to this kind of persuasion, and so we project it onto others.
Most people aren't this rational. The average person's reason for adopting Bitcoin would look something like a *ShamWow!* commercial. Or Kim Kardashian getting a Bitcoin Tattoo on her ass.
Think about this:
How many people have cell phones? vs. How many people who can explain to you in full detail how a cell phone works? 
The cell phone carriers never sell you a cell phone by arguing the technical points of how it works.
How many people spend dollars? vs. How many people can explain to you in full detail how the dollar works?
As a community, perhaps we need to train ourselves in managing the irrational side of human nature as well as the rational side.

This is exactly what I say to naysayers when they call the idea of digital currency "silly."
@_date: 2013-11-05 19:48:59
I recently did an [Article On This](  It's a very old problem. Bitcoin is part of a much larger trend which is going to upend the nature of society.
@_date: 2013-10-04 17:15:58
Why would they create it when they already own everything? It makes no sense.
@_date: 2013-12-23 17:25:21
Probably BTC &lt;-&gt; LTC trades. Not LTC &lt;-&gt; Fiat.
@_date: 2013-12-28 00:43:24
"Not as well as they had hoped." Which is becoming a recurring result of their old tactics. 
@_date: 2013-10-27 04:35:13
Some great points, here. 
People need to be comfortable with us as a community. We can't come off as fanatics. Most of us don't, but a few of us are guilty.
Every great business endeavor starts by asking:
What does the customer want?
The strongest forms of persuasion *don't* involve arguing with people.

[My Take On This](
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:26:41
I joined. This is a simple way to improve image and adoption.
@_date: 2013-10-03 05:32:22
I agree. I also think that at this point, any publicity is good publicity. It allows us to become more accepted into mainstream culture. The more people talk about BTC, the more quickly it will become accepted. People are starting to see it as more than *just a fad*.

The Republican Liberty Caucus of South Carolina already accepts donations in Bitcoin.
I imagine she would be quite receptive to the idea. Aside from that, Lindsey Graham needs to be fired.
*My apologies for mispost.

The article indicated that it was currently open. I believe they are preparing to launch. Probably a misunderstanding on the part of the author.
@_date: 2013-07-30 00:03:06
He should offer to pay for the repairs in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-28 22:39:49
He mentioned that a lot of Crypto and NetSec professionals accepted coins for their personal work contributions.
I know plenty of folks in my line of work who are in it for the long run...
