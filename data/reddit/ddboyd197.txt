It's not illegal to use other currencies. Just more difficult.

What would Bitcoin do without it's
 testnet?

Thanks. This is the perfect example!

I don't know man, just going off of what other people who've been in the game a lot longer are saying. Everything that's being implemented on Bitcoin...segwit, etc.. was run on Litecoin first. Here's what one of the Winklevoss twins said.
 Litecoin wasn't created to be Asic resistant because Asics didn't even exist for Bitcoin at that time. It just happened to end up that way for a while..

Sorry I guess I don't understand. How will sidechain help replace altcoins? It seems like it would make them more usable.

Don't know if that is always the case. I like BTC and LTC. Today LTC  has been pulling up BTC.

I'm sure I don't which is why I was asking. Still don't totally understand. How are they different than atomic swaps?

I guess my question was about side chain. I don't think Bitcoin can just copy all the other coins. For example if they wanted to copy Litecoin they would have to cut their block size by 4 which would make them less secure. Charlie Lee knew this when he created it, which is why his intent was for cheaper less secure, but 4x faster, and cheaper purchases. Granted lightening will help but the same applies with opening and closing channels. I like BTC, but it seems like side chain will actually make it easier to use some of the alt coins for things Bitcoin can't do.

Thanks, that was the best explanation I've heard. So while it would give all the power of the other alts to bitcoin, wouldn't it also legitimize and strengthen the alts that serve a separate purpose. In other words wouldn't it strengthen all of those currencies together?
