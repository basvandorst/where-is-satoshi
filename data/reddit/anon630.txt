I'm not even thinking of putting cash into that sinkhole.  
Just stating that coins are finally cheap somewhere. Cheap enough I'd buy one.   But the issue is the exchange is not trustworthy.   So I won't be purchasing from them

They messed with peoples money already. The damage is already done. So I personally wouldn't be shocked if they lost most if not all of thier clientele.

I'm a relative noob to bitcoin. (Been following for about a year) mind giving a brief or not so brief history of the said event. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 17:52:41
It's cool. It's the internet.  Things get misconstrued everyday
@_date: 2014-02-20 07:05:19
Love me some buttcoin
@_date: 2014-02-20 16:34:32
Finally bitcoins that are cheap and I would buy one. 
But I don't trust the exchange. &gt;. &lt;

Never invest money you can't afford to lose.  
@_date: 2014-02-15 17:37:26
Well once everything goes down that's going to, I highly doubt they will be getting repeat clients, or new clients for that matter. 
Either they are going to pay up and people move thier money. Or they rip everyone off.

Don't gamble with money thst you can't afford to lose. 
This is what I'm keeping in mind. Especially since I think the house will win this one. 
@_date: 2014-01-31 15:55:41
 Was my thought.  
They well say he might have sold illegally to a minor.

What type of rope, wife and I could use some more. But wouldn't any couple. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 08:02:52
Just started to get some coin. No outside use for it thus far. 
But the  again only got about 35 cents worth. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 14:20:31
Now I see my issue. Trying to send play/test money to a real account.
 Lesson learned.

I used to go to horror cons/musical fest with $300/400+ in pocket. The atms in the area would surely be sucked dry in the first few hours. (Plus hate posting surcharges) 
It was always worrisome that someone would see the wade when purchasing something and target you for the cash. This was before mobile credit was popular. 
So the idea of something that you can easily hide your true balance and purchase goods with ease. Has appeal to me.

Thank you.

Nothing yet. Not enough btc. But working on sugering ul the wife.

What's the point of having money, but no means to spend it?
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:19:58
Throwaway not needed. 
I have 0.0012 coin. 
Going the price keeps rising so I can buy a cup of coffee one day. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:46:27
Good selection. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 04:37:07
If it crashs low enough may buy a few myself
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:05:45
First few years of fest fir me at least  credit was out of the question. Luckily it's growing a bit. 
@_date: 2013-08-05 22:30:28
This is awesome. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 04:53:28
From what I'm gathering test net is just a testing ground, thus worthless? 
Thus if I'm expecting any actual coins just us my bitcoin wallet since these coins are on par with monopoly money? 
(Thanks for the helping a new guy/gal out)

Knew it! Seth Putnam has inspired allot of my sense of humor throughout the years.

First tip and thank you

Year from now would be hard to argue against. 
Personally would be more interested to hear the agreements for the long haul. 10+ years
@_date: 2013-12-25 13:36:43
Wish I could draw. 
Enjoy this one guys/gals. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 12:41:47
This is why I hope that bitcoin becomes a normal currency. Events I hate going to them with cash in my pocket. So going with coin and being able to use that would be some stress relief. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 04:04:00
No value per set? 
(Relative new to this, playing around to just educate myself)
@_date: 2013-10-05 19:42:00
Thanks for the chuckle.
