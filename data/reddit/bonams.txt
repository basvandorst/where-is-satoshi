imagine a busy street you know, and 1000 people carrying some extra gadget in their pocket for payment. i dont see it happening, phone is one stop solution, you can implement various authorisations on phone itself. 
when you talk about widespread, things must be integrated into existing accessible devices, than to propose a new hardware. 
I went after building a hardware wallet for a month and gave up because it will not be changing the world, but just complicating itin the name of security. 2fa, otp, etc can do the stuff. we can add more layers to ensure its most secure

i will study in in detail, but have an amateur question here:
exchanges like coinbase host the wallets, which is a single point of failure in case their systems are compromised...will multi-sig allow decentralisation of hosting the wallets, by giving the user his wallet but controlling the spending by requiring the exchange to authorize a transaction...

its again a travel towards centralisation..and less secure as an attack will mess up the balances and processor cant refund the losses as there is no bank backing it. if there has to be refund, there will be an insurance premium against loss, then transaction prices will go up and ends up like existing credit card networks. 
most of it has to happen over blockchain, otherwise there is no point in using bitcoin right?
one more argument is: if most people chose to store bitcoins locally. then blockchain must be ready for it

First production run will be for all the orders (hundreds after a full pre-order campaign), but first 20 will be with more customization on the wristband design. 
All the units will have full planned features and no improvements planned.
Water proof as its completely a plastic body, the display is a plastic e-ink display covered inside a touch screen. 
Flexible touch screen will be pressure sensitive rather than heat sensitive. So again, shatter proof and waterproof. Having a glass display is bad in so many ways on a wrist (scratches, shatter, reflections)
we are in talks with a flexible battery technology too. We are too flexible you know! :D

using blockchain info, because its few thousands of dollars, and definitely online wallets are not recommended for high amounts
 steps: 
1. very strong password and the mnemonic phrase, write it down on physical paper and save a copy on encrypted file on computer.
2. 2fa with sms
3. enable wallet backup which is encrypted to ur email
4. also enable 2nd password for sending money out of the account
5. lock the ip to one computer in security settings

 I have gone through the process of opening a wallet, its easy enough.. great work there!, but the home page gives a feeling that its some what complex or you need to be technically sound to use it. for instance blockchain info UI/UX is just like opening an email account. but greenaddress felt a little bit technical.. 
I would: 
1. hide the sections "Bitcoin is the currency of the future", "Better privacy with your funds.." and the "More features that allow.." to another page so that the home page doesnt become an educational session to a user. simply puts off the dare to next step.
2. instead add latest transactions, stats of green address and bitcoin as a whole to instill confidence in user that people are actively using this service.
3. 4th section of comparision chart is good, that can be moved up saying "this is what greenaddress is all about" in a single picture
4. to bring in new ideas for growth-hacking... deploying a dummy/open fork of your site please conduct hackathons/bitcointalk-bountys to simplify the UI/UX and 
also let your multi-sig wallet be a platform for others to build new applications on top. thats the essence of multi-sig, it has many possibilities and you have made a good start. for instance, an escrow account on top of greenaddress, your wallet being the default wallet for exchanges since nobody holds full control, offer startups/companies with multi-sig wallets as a service, etc. you need a distribution channel to get users on board (while you keep doing just one thing perfectly- to host a multi-sig wallet) you are the MULTISIG WALLET PLATFORM
thats where blockchain has been successful, it nailed being just one thing- bitcoin wallet where they dont hold keys.
now green address  is huge if, it nails at being- multisig wallet where no exchange/company/escrow holds keys. you are different from blockchain in a big way.
(hope i didnt piss you off) all the very best.

if you set a trailing stop for $20, price falls from $800 to $780, btc converted to usd.. (our additional feature: If price rises above 780, then buy) 
again when price is at $1000, the btc are sold at $980.
trailing stop loss: certain % fall triggers a sell.

it may fall, but today ill pay the price of 800 as i think soon it will have more infrastructure around it and will be more valuable
just my knowledge.

how does it work.. no clue 
@_date: 2014-01-27 15:24:58
promptly added our incorporation and office space details, thanks.
I didnt put up an instant buy, shopping cart so that one can fill the form and reach our email for knowing more about us and then buying.
We currently have 2 working prototypes, fully functional with motion sensor, micro controller, battery. only casing is pending and its just a matter of some 3d printing n other tools.. will update soon
jan 2014: 
november 2013: 
we have ambitious goals and you can get a this early price of $199, ill bear the shipping. (the first 100 production run will cost us $300 but we will take the cut for early adoptors who support us all the way. anytime we will refund if you change your mind. looking for proof of demand now!)
@_date: 2014-01-04 09:40:36
is it already implemented by any service

china went to the moon instead of bitcoin. bitcoin scheduled for mars.
@_date: 2014-01-02 15:39:05
okay how much of a difference in demand do you think is there for long vs short positions.
if there was a service only for long positions, it would be beneficial for btc value? since everyone is betting for a price rise
@_date: 2014-03-11 06:32:22
Yup happened earlier

@_date: 2014-01-24 15:53:16
nope, if price you bought is 800, and overnight it falls to 750, you will still have 790, coz of stop loss feature.
@_date: 2014-01-05 19:30:20
hahaha i just scrolled to bottom of the page

last year video?
@_date: 2014-01-16 22:32:05
I have seen most of my friends prefer altcoin mining, adoption for bitcoin started with mining. When miners have coins to spend and it gains value by increased acceptance from merchants. 
$700 is a conservative estimate considering that it hit $500 in last month. (Bitcoin price will rise but not exponentially)
@_date: 2014-01-07 19:05:51
thats maximum potential, im talking about risk free evaluation. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:46:44
look at the 180 day graph of all altcoins on coinmarketcap. they had 10x spike early on and then endedup close to opening bid now
@_date: 2014-01-15 21:15:17

such wow much thanks
@_date: 2014-03-24 22:05:08
Blockchain.info sees themselves as bitcoin software platform and doesn't like dealing with banks.  All their employees are also paid in btc, the business as a whole doesn't hold a single bank account. 
No way they will acquire something like Mtgox

@_date: 2014-01-17 22:13:08
in technology you cant precisely predict what will happen after 20 years. 
So I don't worry about bitcoin's status in the year 2140 today itself. quantum comupting, new breakthrough coins, anything is possible in a 100 years. 
all that matters is 2014, not 2140.

@_date: 2014-01-09 07:17:15
there are two things to consider for the 10c per dollar you are paying:
1. you pay 10c even when you buy a house using bitcoin.
2. bitcoin itself is growing in value, so 10c is already free internet money , for a portion of users.

actually there are some amazing new features by brilliant developers in works for core technology of bitcoin, and the network effect/brand of bitcoin is unbeatable
@_date: 2014-04-01 17:22:32
in my mind Hal Finney it is, and unfortunate he is not able to actively contribute more
@_date: 2014-01-10 13:02:25
would the same problem return with PoS? I think right now, no new users are able to contribute to mining with their own computers and thats leading to a giant corporation to deal with it.
@_date: 2014-03-24 17:11:45

i think wallet services like blockchain.info manage to resend the transactions if it remains unconfirmed.
payment processors can take the load away by off-chain transactions and wallets can re-schedule the payments in event of overload.
i think so
@_date: 2014-04-02 18:06:35
I had coins on an older version, updated to new verison and the password recovery with pass-phrase doesn't work. User error mostly but there is some risk in using it. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 19:09:40
if it works as said, service like this must be linked to all exchanges
@_date: 2014-01-19 14:06:18
Great work there. 
another way is, if it can use qr scan to sign offline transactions.. ive tried doing it but dont have the patience to see it through.
@_date: 2014-01-11 16:35:11
with little funding from donations and website owners, it can be made open and automated. key component is : address linked to website name.
Also I think blockchain itself can be used to permanently store some data. so it is the server. website runs a script to extract confirmation.
namecoin: store data on blockchain

as a trader for high leverage right? (it works like this: a deposit of 100$ gives you upto 1000$ worth of BTC, and profit or loss can be stopped at anytime)

*SATOSHI NAKAMOTO came up with a way to eliminate middlemen in financial transactions*
there are only three or four important points about bitcoin. 
It is a new invention that solves the problem of **keeping track of who owns what**, and the way it does is very very very efficient that if used as a currency it will eliminate the international exchange fees we pay to existing money transfer agencies and also make peer to peer transactions on the internet a breeze, all you need is a qr code to send and receive money.
*if used as a currency it will not be in control of governments or banks which are failing to take responsibility for the huge mistakes they make in strengthening our economy.*
**Bitcoin puts the power in your hands, in developers hands, in everyones hands, just like internet gave you the freedom to information. this is freedom to your economic activity**
Enabled by the most secure cryptographic algorithms and its network of people who act for the benefit of community.
@_date: 2014-03-08 19:24:28
did you ever use a backup to recover the wallet. I did it several times as I forget password and now I have 4 login-Id's and passwords with 2fa, all to the same account.
possibilities are: 
email, backup compromised on pc/phone, virus, other's access to your device
@_date: 2014-01-18 00:33:36
ideal answer. a website is nothing, you can do it on spreadsheet also. People willing to use it is key

2. a dedicated alt coin will support only them like a local currency for community benefit/co-op
3. investing, loaning, allowing them to choose a job are already in works and the impact isn't satisfactory. an alt coin for their growth is a new possibility. The outcomes are more interesting when you give them the freedom to choose their economy.

@_date: 2014-01-28 08:43:49
live example: I am working on my smartwatch startup since 6 months. applied for a business bank account and 
1. took two months to get one,
2. no loan, 
3. fees on all transactions which is an expense for me, 
4. high fees on international orders and an exchange rate loss,
5. and risk of chargebacks on every sale I make. (then I gotta spend time and money dealing with fraudulent claims)
... suddenly there was bitcoin,
1. I got a blockchain account in 5 minutes, 
2. got 10 sales on smartwatches in few hours from bitcoin owners
3. got offered a loan for the startup, without even asking for one(makes a big difference to world if all startup ideas can be funded from anywhere in the world, creating new jobs and building economy) (while banks make us pay for their bankruptcies and governments take taxes for funding wars with 95% of tax, and 3% street lights and roads)
4. no chargeback risk, all payments are final
5. blockchain.info gives me complete control of my money and the security side will evolve to make it easy for your dad to use one day soon.

on bitfinex you can only lend btc for short positions and there is very little demand for btc loan. Usd loans are used for long positions on bitfinex.
Krypton is a btc-only platform.
1.. the leverage rates will be much higher as its btc-only deposits and can be made from any country. more liquidity for loans.
2.. the leverage will be flexible, you can choose from 0-10, and BTC loans can be traded hourly, instead of 2 or 30 days like bitfinex.
and some more scalable features will be added. such as,

cashing out immediately to fiat is'nt a solution looking from the bitcoin side of things, it still heavily depends on traditional banking. If you see the effective conversion rate from bitpay or coinbase to fiat currency for merchants, it ranges beteen 3% to 5%. so the only advantage merchants are getting is attracting bitcoin users to their stores. the transaction fees ironically is double is you convert every transaction to fiat. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 13:42:26

for the fun of it atleast, an average person cant mine bitcoins today, while alt coins can be. so people trying to explore crypto currency want to support more accessible currencies, that can be somehow magically made on their computers or mobile phones.
Talking about alt-coin adoption, alt-coins can fast catch up to bitcoin, as fiat to bitcoin is difficult ..but bitcoin to alt-coin is very very easy IF they can provide improved transaction speeds, or volatility solutions.
@_date: 2013-12-22 21:48:57

oops sorry, actually the merchant pays 1% of the funds, but user is taking a hit by paying an exchange rate set by bitpay/coinbase.

To insulate those sellers against Bitcoin fluctuations, the eBay-like drug site also offers a hedging service. Sales are held in escrow until buyers receive their orders via mail, and vendors are given the choice to turn on a setting that pegs the escrow’s value to the dollar, with Silk Road itself covering any losses or taking any gains from Bitcoin’s swings in value that occur while the drugs are in transit. So while Bitcoin’s crash last week from $237 to less than $100 means that the Dread Pirate Roberts was likely forced to pay out much of the extra gains Silk Road made from Bitcoin’s rise, most of his sellers were protected from those price changes and continued to trade their drugs for Bitcoins despite the currency’s plummeting value.

i was thinking about that too.. what if every merchant can sell bitcoins by having to send a physical token that gives a password to complete the transfer of bitcoin purchase online.
i guess by sending a physical token, you can avoid chargebacks.
the received token will have 1st half of a full password, and the other half will be emailed.
and posts can be sent in a day. not a big delay. 
your thoughts?

the eating coin cost is my unique solution, and im holding it for now. Spartaaa!

good one bud , me bad speaker. i would have tried if i could bet on bitcoin rise and fall graphs. like a game with others betting

you could be right for today

chineese are tech savvy and if bitcoin works in china, there is no turning back. but chances seem bleak and looks like revolution will be localised to US. even india is big but lags heavily in technology adoption.

my bad, im just learning all this stuff.

also tried searching their twitter page for announcements, but yeah 'white label'. 
If you are a startup, its better to rely on them for data hosting for a monthly service fee, rather than trying to set up the whole thing and then having to test if your NEW exchange gets any traction or not. If your key advantage is not 'location of data hosting'.. Let them do what they are good at and startup can focus on marketing. demand can be estimated and data can be moved away.

advantages of alt coins:
*faster transaction speed
*lesser carbon foot print than bitcoin supercomputers
*different currency for different interests/communities
*different purposes apart from currency
@_date: 2013-12-24 08:59:56
also, i found this:
 The internal audit problems at both Apple and the NSA ensure that crime syndicates already have a copy of the IPhone backdoor database at their disposal. If the hundreds of millions of IPhone users start using their phone to do anything important at all, we will see a heist never seen before in the history of mankind.

exactly, i was doin a smartwatch startup,  . pretty decent idea, but once i read about bitcoin i dumped my 20kpound startup.
we need bitcoin more than anything today
@_date: 2013-12-22 14:17:02
they do.. in a big way add value to bitcoin, because we are having a direct real world value for bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-24 03:08:10
mainstream users wont use offline wallets, mostly thirdparty wallets like coinbase, 2FA

every common person asked about bitcoin, or media , or even the Chinese regulators are worried about bitcoin mainly because of its volatility.. im not trying to solve it entirely, but for a section of people who need it and want to use it at a stable price for everyday money transfers/purchases
@_date: 2013-12-27 13:01:21
bitcoin is speculative, but has a clear use. DECENTRALIZED LEDGER
"20 years back I used to have a network of 10 people that I exchange money with, now with the internet and social networks I have 300+ places I exchange money and the existing banking infrastructure is not enough for this kind of internet growth" Im talking to you from London, you might be in usa, I need your full name and bank details if I need to exchange something with you. limits the possibilities of commerce between every one of us.
 Bitcoin is what you make of it, people will have their own definitions for bitcoin, what i care is IT IS REVOLUTIONARY, regulations don't care about innovations.
Also, I have always been fascinated by alternative currencies, if entrepreneurs work on money services, we will one day end poverty using this vehicle. Im not interested in business vehicles alone. 
p.s  Im only 23 yrs

i didnt see any legit btc customers have problems.. coinbase, mtgox, btc china, localbitcoins.. when people traded responsibly. and made money given the percentage rise in 2013. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 14:59:38
yeah how could someone login an remove the phone? i didnt use any 2fa or coinbase but that should not be possible.
@_date: 2013-12-26 11:50:37
cool concept.. but the bitcoins look pale, a darker image stands out i think, if i can talk abt the graphic.
@_date: 2013-12-22 14:51:35
if your phone number could be removed, how is it a 2fa then? 
@_date: 2013-12-27 10:16:15
Usa is all about spending, china money is all about saving, so for bitcoin china money will be like a back up bank/resource, bringing it real value. and also the numbers/number of people matter in bitcoin adoption. 
ive heard repeatedly from friends that there is a huge demand for storing value of savings, either in gold or whatever alternative investment source comes up. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:07:13

@_date: 2013-12-16 20:18:02
chineese investors are looking for new ways to invest.. so it is a really great market, if it works

I'd cut the borders and stick it to the ceiling 
@_date: 2013-12-23 22:50:05
yup its a responsibility, and must avoid all Single-point-of-failures in moving this 
@_date: 2013-12-27 13:11:23
you are right, if P/L is made is realised in fiat, then it will be taxable like any other personal investments. 
But in the long run, digital currencies will eliminate the need for you to convert back to fiat. 
1) you can spend cryptocash like real cash, and 
2)one of the crypto currencies provides a stable value=cashout bitcoin to altcoin of a fixed value.
my point is that ccrypto currencies will reduce every need for the less efficient fiat.. so, setting tax regulations on crypto will be a difficult task as they cant be tracked with the proliferation of alt coins
@_date: 2013-12-25 21:48:40

tl;dr 
rats, rats, bitcoins

and a norway's announcement adds wind to the flame
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:25:01
the price will surely rise. Recent hike to 1300 had no real meaning in it according to transactions/usage of those bitcoins. Now we will be left with great technology in few hands, a lot of potential left.

true and even for that to happen one has to smoothly buy a bitcoin. The prices on local exchanges like localbitcoins are higher by 50$ compared to usa prices because, there is no coinbase in uk

dogecoin is awesome, haha
much wow

stopping volatility is good for a section of audience, who want to take advantage of its convenience, for everyday payments and storing value without loss over time
volatility is good for trading coins and has a separate market

To calculate the fee you need to know all of the inputs and their balances, because a fee is not stored in transactions, it is just sum(inputs) - sum(outputs)

did'nt this help , ill read it again for the source.

bitcoin exchanges, wallets, websites are closed down or hacked every now and then. If a user has an approved bitcoin app in his iphone and loses money due to company shutdown, we will blame that APPLE MUST CHECK THE RELIABILITY of every app in its store. Accepting Bitcoin apps is like enabling an .exe file on ios, increasing the risk of viruses. Apple is safe than sorry, like its securely built OS.
They know that banning bitcoin wont stop users from bitcoin. A Html5 snippet would do the work in most cases.
@_date: 2013-12-23 22:39:26
I totally agree, it is half baked, but I have been waiting for a solution since a month for bitcoin price volatility.. i think i found an answer and was excited to share it on reddit,.. will work on it an bake it more in the coming days.
@_date: 2013-12-24 16:24:37
now bitcoin reached a considerable level where its not an alien term anymore, and in everybody's mind it has once reached 1200 or 1000. so when people see a price of 500, its like the last chance for them to get on board at reasonable price, as it has the chances to double up to 1000$ in the future..
so if you try to sell it for 500$ anytime there are more people willing to buy.
Its PRICE IS THE PERCEPTION OF ITS VALUE..
 thanks to the media coverage, bitcoin is worth between 500-700 in for the majority.
Many people are holding bitcoins, so retailers want to appeal to this customer base and 2014 will be the year of RETAIL+BITCOIN = eventually bringing a direct exchange value in the form of real goods.
Here and there, big announcements will be made by billion dollar companies entering this market and we will see more innovation driving the price, eventually driving confidence and more adoption.
It will be a baby dinosaur of 700-1000$ as a conservative prediction and some magic innovation/news will spark a 2000$ valuation
dont let go, if its affordable money. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 09:55:20
again, if there is no volatility, who cares to invest in btc except for the tech savvy ? imagine btc price is fixed to 500$ from today. will the adoption keep increasing????
@_date: 2013-12-20 17:45:14

It works like the colored coins concept where I will use small 0.1btc as 600$ of kryptoncoins and confirmations can be done over the block chain.

is nxtcoin legit?  dgex has been down all day. now its back though.
@_date: 2013-12-24 22:35:44
perfect bullet points. a guide to all newbies. 


is the solution but imagine everyone carrying a mobile phone and a hardware wallet for payments. for Widespread, there must be something thats online authentication but far more secure, 
some banks use one time password hardware(Barclays has PinsEntry), mtgox also has an OTP card. 
i guess OTP card should be integrated with every online wallet
