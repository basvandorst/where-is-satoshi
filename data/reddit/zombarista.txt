The one less thing/one more thing can't be coincidence, right?

An overwhelming amount of Starbucks transactions are through the Starbucks card (BTC could be used to reload) and the mobile app (pay with BTC or BTC-via-card). Those are two avenues where you're not holding up the line to send BTC.
Starbucks has been very forward-thinking on the future if payment and I think they're a great company to bring Bitcoin closer to everyday retail.

A number to the zeroth power is 1.
So you're asking what costs 1 Bitcoin... Lots of things I suppose.

Oh whoops. 1 Satoshi will become the penny of the future. With 100 Satoshi being approx 1 dollar, there's a lot of room to hold value up to 21 million * 10^8 Satoshi
Approx 21 * 10^14 pennies, or 21 trillion dollars.

I think we could similarly say that if you don't have the cash, you don't have the money. At some point, some mainstream conveniences are inevitable to help Bitcoin reach critical mass.

The episode that was a "single take" was so unbelievably good.
Also great pilot episode.

I think OP is jazzed that decentralized systems like this messaging and also Bitcoin are able to withstand government censorship.

Technical analysis is foolish and this pattern is a coincidence.

Clearly, I see a death cross!
