Andreas Antinoplous had a good point when he said that it takes about $1000 of electricity /computing power to create 1 bitcoin, where it only takes maybe a couple of dollars to create a bill. In that way bitcoin is more inherently valuable than any fiat currency.

As a Canadian I didn't know much about Kennedy and the potential motives behind his assassination. It's really not that wild of a conspiracy to think the federal reserve may have been behind it. Very excited to see what the future of crypto hodls.

It's definitely high risk, but this is all one big experiment after all! There are test environments and smart contract auditors to ensure the code is tight, but there have been losses in the past and there will be losses in the future.
That being said, Ethereum has a staggering amount of potential, and a large development ecosystem.
Bitcoin on the other hand is taking more of a slow and steady approach, it's well established and is easily the safest crypto by a longshot. I see Bitcoin as the 'reserve currency' of the crypto world, a lot like gold's historical role in our economy. You'll often hear bitcoin referred to as 'digital gold,' which is very accurate. 
I'm not sure if I'll ever pay for an Uber with Bitcoin. I don't think it will be long before I'm paying for one with Ether. But I'd also never want to keep all of my money on Ethereum. I would keep all my money in Bitcoin though. 
I like both projects and do not believe they are as in direct competition as many may think. Many crypto investors hold both coins.

How do they make it so someone doesn't just put a sticker of their own qr code over the original?
