Honesty I wouldn't be surprised to see it drop below 1k. Typically a post bubble correction takes the price back to the mean before the price spike happened. Not always the case but that is typical behavior. And this particular spike was HUGE and started all the way down about 6-800

Not really no. It's still a volitile market. But I'm definitely waiting for the bottom of this fall before I consider buying. Which I don't think we're anywhere near right now.

I had no idea Doctor Octopus used Reddit.

Remember: You need to sell now to prevent from losing even more. You can always buy again when the price hits bottom. And we're not even close to bottom yet. I fully expect the price to hit 1k and lower. Mark my words.

Yes because that's what stocks do after losing 50% of their value in 5 weeks. They suddenly regain it all back!

Holy shit. My mom came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken nuggets and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of chicken nuggets out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from the Bitcoin price tonight. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is it still falling? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so fiat. I want a currency that isn't manipulated by the fed and also makes me a huge profit. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought we were going to the Moon???? This is so fucked.

The definition of a crash is typically considered losing 10% of your value in a single day. This was definitely a crash. Not a correction.

That and a central bank that controls its supply and the fact that billions of people trade with it every day.
