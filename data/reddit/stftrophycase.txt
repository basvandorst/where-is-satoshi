We had a "crash" as large as the 2008 crisis like 2 weeks ago in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-11 09:18:19
Yeah? I mean it's not as if he was alone in proposing it. Had he been the only one to suggest it, it never would have reached consensus. It managed to because many people agreed with it.
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:20:33
Can confirm. I've had massive issues trying to resync my node after being on vacation for a month. Will try Parity and report back.
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:38:18
A transaction backlog is essential. This shouldn't be news
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:39:32
No it isn't "safe to say that". Adoption/use is basically 0 and mainnet inventives are not properly in place yet.
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:56:12
Centralization isn't a binary thing, but yeah
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:18:37
No, the ratio has maintained around 0.1-0.2 since basically the initial pump.

"Continue losing customers"... aren't they growing massively?
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:22:16
The Ethereum community chose to run code that reversed a specific transaction. Vitalik wouldn't be able to reverse a copay for his dentist visit or his trip to the grocery store. There is a difference.

It is way way too soon to prove or disprove the hub theory.

Well the real question is why people would use RSK when they are already using Ethereum?
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:59:48
Because it's more decentralized?
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:04:48
Interesting analogy, but you still need to maintain global state, as far as I understand.
@_date: 2018-01-14 22:24:33
They've got less to lose.
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:14:35
Still begs the question, since Ethereum can do all of this too, why use RSK?
@_date: 2018-01-14 04:18:27
Yeah... what the hell is up with the Tezos logo in the back of the Bitcoin photo lol?
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:52:45
The true believers haven't left. Segwit isn't a priority for them, sorry people can't accept that. I doubt they see Bitcoin as the future of cryptocurrency and don't want to waste their engineering resources on Segwit.

As I've said in the other thread. Coinbase stated many months ago they are focusing more on Ethereum moving forward.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:28:24
Cause he's watching the charts, right?
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:05:22
If he moved all hashpower to Bitcoin Cash and that made Bitcoin vulnerable to 51% attacks, that would mean that Bitcoin was already vulnerable to a 51% attack in the first place, as this would imply that someone has more hashpower than Jihan does.
Anyone that can mine Bitcoin can also mine Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash's mining is not fundamentally more centralized than Bitcoin's.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:26:35
Segwit2x != Segwit.
Segwit is a technology (code changes). Segwit2x was a fork of the Bitcoin code repo by a handful of (supposedly) malicious developers... basically a hostile takeover of control of the Bitcoin codebase.
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:34:22
No? You only have 20% left before there are no new buyers
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:39:35
How does this dispel the FUD? Basically all I got from this video is that in addition to wallstreet shorting and dumping the underlying, miners can now go short as well to hedge, creating downward pressure that wasn't already present.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:26:37
What? Both can coexist just fine? Just because Bitcoin Cash wants their transactions on chain doesn't mean they are trying to kill Bitcoin lol. How does one imply the other at all?
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:25:01
Customers don't want their transactions stuck. Getting out in the next block guaranteed is likely more important to them than paying a smaller fee.
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:40:16
More of this "early adopter" nonsense.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:23:02
Coinbase is focusing on Ethereum now. I don't think implementing Segwit is high on their priority list.

LOL I lost it.
Edit: And is that if statement misformatted?
@_date: 2017-03-25 04:53:58
How many of these people are there? This is clearly false, the price has been negatively correlated with BU support.
@_date: 2017-03-25 04:46:27
Good point. So the plan is collude to cause panic and profit? And worst case you've probably paid for a lot of your mining equipment.
@_date: 2017-03-25 04:41:10
Care to back up any of what you said? I recently attended a LN tech talk and can't agree. LN is currently available on testnet:  and is nearing the full specification.
@_date: 2017-03-24 10:11:20
Is it possible that the stall is also an attempt to manipulate price. I remember going to a talk with Jihan Wu and he mentioned that he doesn't sell his excess BTC, but hold it. Perhaps it is being used to pump other coins?
@_date: 2017-03-25 02:59:26
To use your analogy, then it is as if the child's feet will grow until the end of time, and no matter how large the shoes are on the child, the feet will eventually grow to fit them. Eventually, you won't be able to afford to buy a new pair of shoes.
@_date: 2017-02-17 04:27:20
These stats make it seem like usage or number of transactions is increasing. A bit misleading since these numbers are not price independent
@_date: 2017-03-22 20:14:38
If you hold your bitcoins, you will get coins on both chains if it hard forks. You can use whichever bitcoin client you want but there is no guarantee there won't be long wait times or miners on one or the other.
@_date: 2017-03-22 23:06:15
Oh and that BU blocks continued to be mined at the same rate.
@_date: 2017-03-26 02:05:50
According to the bottom chart and the 144 block line, this is the highest it has ever been for 144 blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-25 19:15:14
Fair enough, I wasn't aware of that consequence of LN and will need to look a little deeper into it. But do you really think all of Bitcoin scaling can be done on chain?
@_date: 2017-03-18 04:40:56
Amazing how relevant this is today.
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:33:31
Yeah sorry this is complete nonsense
@_date: 2017-03-22 03:35:02
Funny how the number of nodes dips but they are still mining just as many blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:37:09
Sorry but this is a really childish view of how the world works. Violence and the threat of it is an incredibly useful tool and how literally every single form of governance works.
The principals of bitcoin are founded in game theory and ensuring that a malicious actor cannot damage the system without harming their own self interest.
@_date: 2017-03-24 22:23:09
It's the same difficulty. Ease of pumping depends entirely on liquidity, which is independent of price.
@_date: 2017-03-22 17:47:03
I mean he's clearly lying.
@_date: 2017-03-22 08:56:00
They're thanking Core for helping find bugs in the code and are angry about "malicious attacks" that practically anyone with any incentive could carry out.
@_date: 2017-03-24 02:55:46
Well if we're talking about edge case risk then storing some on an exchange may be advantageous in the case where the network becomes unusable and you cannot liquidate your coins or a bug in the protocol appears.
@_date: 2017-03-22 09:04:48
That's the thing... like maybe I don't fully understand how it works, but it seems like for their node to stay up, they would need to be running Core but signaling for Unlimited. In that case are they doing it for leverage?
@_date: 2017-08-31 11:19:09

@_date: 2017-08-31 01:39:11
As someone else said, you only need to broadcast an unconfirmed transaction within 15 minutes. As I understand it, you are sending BTC to a brand new address and therefore as soon as they see a transaction sent to that address, they will assume it was you who paid, since nobody else has knowledge of the address. Don't worry about high fees, 20-30 sat/byte should be just fine
@_date: 2017-08-12 13:00:29
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:56:16
I've never heard/read this, but I imagine you'd want to keep the keys around in case:
* You're wrong
* You accidentally send BTC to your old wallet address instead of a new one (copy wrong string, autofill, etc.)
* Someone else accidentally (or purposefully) sends BTC to that address.

If Satoshi moved coins that would create enormous panic uncertainty. Many assume Satoshi is dead, so if this person is alive then who is it and why are they moving coins now? Have they lost faith in Bitcoin?
Not to mention the potentially massive number of coins that would hit the markets if Satoshi wanted to sell. There isn't enough demand to absorb that kind of inflation in any reasonable period of time.

@_date: 2017-11-14 18:52:32
Except that's a strawman. The real argument he's making is:
"I think murder is fucked up and would never murder someone, but if someone downloads a video of a real murder happening (that they didn't commit) and watches it (out of some enjoyment or whatever), simply having the file on your computer can't be considered a 'risk to others', nor does legally having a video file with a murder necessarily increase the chance of actual murders happening"
@_date: 2017-04-18 04:25:16
Miners are still greedy of course. They have just realized that they stand to gain more by market manipulation, monopolies, and leveraging manufacturing/hardware advantages than banking on the price to go up from protocol upgrades.
@_date: 2017-04-18 04:22:13
There are hash algorithms that are safe against quantum computers. Also a quantum computer would likely not mine, but instead just steal money straight from wallets.
@_date: 2017-04-13 16:27:50
It doesn't need to be defined. If one coin is not accepted and worthless for the most part, then the economic majority has decided. Simple as that.
@_date: 2017-04-19 03:06:19
Just a correction on this:




The amount of security (difficulty of a 51% attack) is related to what percentage of the hashpower can be bought with a certain amount of money. Pretend all ASICS are $1000, and suppose the network has 1000 asics mining on it. I can spend $10000 to buy ~1% of the hashpower, this is independent of the hashpower of the machines that I'm buying. If every ASIC on the network converts from 28nm to 16nm, then I still need to buy the same number of machines to have the same fraction of hashpower.
You are right that ASICBoost does not do more work.
@_date: 2017-04-12 00:08:11
Realistically, the only way to compete in mining in the future will be to use the generated heat in a useful way
@_date: 2017-04-30 19:02:57
Most altcoins have low liquidity, market cap is not a good measure.
@_date: 2017-04-18 01:51:42
I don't really understand what you mean by this. If given the chance to take millions today or *maybe* a few more millions in 5 years if Bitcoin ever achieves mainstream adoption, it makes a lot of sense to just take the millions today.
@_date: 2017-04-24 01:01:21
Nah, don't do this. If everybody took this advice then Jihan would be the only one mining.
@_date: 2017-04-06 23:05:42
Definitely agree, you are basically just shifting complexity from the miners/users to the protocol.
@_date: 2017-04-27 22:21:35
Nice. Good work man!
@_date: 2017-04-06 23:16:38
Yeah wow, it's so secure when they can manipulate the price, purchase shills and FUD on their behalf, and block technically sound proposals. As it stands, mining centralization is the biggest security threat to Bitcoin

No, they mustn't.

Nah I used to be a Core skeptic then I realized that BU is shitty software and nowhere near as decentralized as Core. Anyone pushing BU as a solution is either stupid or malicious, so pretty much everything follows from that...
@_date: 2017-04-02 18:50:53
I'm hoping we will eventually reach a point where those that can't efficiently use the heat from the mining machines are outmined by those that can (and who are effectively paying less for power). For example, say I run a greenhouse that needs to be heated to 78F, and instead of using traditional heat sources, I mine bitcoin instead. I can offset the cost of electricity this way.
Heat isn't inherently "wasteful"... people just need to think of more clever ways to use it. This is the future imo, and those that don't follow will lose eventually.
@_date: 2017-04-13 18:25:13
There is evidence:
Evidence they have the technology.
Evidence they hold the patent.
Evidence they are mining empty blocks and the empty blocks they mine is consistent with AsicBoost.
Evidence due to their insistence on blocking segwit.
There's not really a whole lot of other evidence you're going to get without physically inspecting the machines. Use common sense.
@_date: 2017-04-22 16:38:45
Classic deflationary currency
@_date: 2017-04-06 20:13:20
This guy literally has every bit of leverage in this situation. His pool has enough hash power to single handedly block segwit indefinitely. Whether this be a legitimate concern or a market manipulation tactic, this guy has too much power. Let it be a warning for Bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-04-22 16:20:38
Good, see ya.
@_date: 2017-04-06 23:09:01

I see, this is a good point.
@_date: 2017-04-17 23:57:37
He can manipulate the markets and also has a covert advantage making him millions *right now*. Given the possibility that Bitcoin is usurped by another currency, it honestly makes a lot of sense to leverage your power while you have it.
@_date: 2017-04-06 19:59:45
Until this guy puts his money where his mouth is, I don't believe it.
@_date: 2017-04-26 05:01:57
Market manipulation is very likely more profitable than mining Bitcoin.

No they aren't, all you need to do is look at the comment I originally replied to. They are using it to imply that Jihan thought low Bitcoin tx fees were unfair to make him look unreasonable (not that he isn't), but he's talking specifically about the signature discount

A majority of full blocks are now over 1 MB
@_date: 2017-09-05 10:52:19
How so? Seems like it's in the best interest of every miner to drive the average fees up. The fact that block size is finite means that even if there are a million 1 satoshi transactions waiting to be confirmed, the "nice" miner mining these transactions wouldn't be able to collect the fees from all of them, only as many as they can fit in a block. Given that this is the case, instead of mining 1000 1 satoshi transactions in their blocks, they might as well just wait for 10 transactions with 100 satoshi fees instead.

I see what you're saying but there are other variables than just a single block to consider. You have information about how other miners are behaving, which isn't present in the prisoner's dilemma, as well as future expected value to consider. An individual miner will earn more in a single block by mining low fee transactions, but won't earn more over time because they incentivise lower fees.


As far as I understand, this shouldn't be the case. If blocks are bigger and more miners are defecting, why would I ever pay more than 1 satoshi for my transaction fee? In the absence of a miner subsidy, blocks either need to be full, or every single miner must have a floor on the fee they are willing to accept in order to mine profitably. One large miner could, of course, mine at a loss to force other miners to also mine at a loss until they go bankrupt (this is why full blocks are important).
@_date: 2017-10-25 05:42:42
The maximum amount of electricity used is equal to the total value mined. The amount of money used to mine will never exceed the amount of money that can be earned, unless Bitcoin is mined at a loss.

No. Translation: Assuming miners are mining at the point of marginal profitabililty, the amount of electricity consumed will be equal, in dollar value, to the total mining revenue.
If miners are mining at a loss, the electricity consumption is obviously unbounded... but that's the same thing as the Saudis burning barrels of oil for no reason.

What you want Bitcoin to be doesn't matter. You can't have everything you want and there are technical limits to what can and can't be done with Bitcoin. People are trying to make emotional arguments to solve technical problems, which is why it's so frustrating arguing with these people. Fees are a necessity, and fees which reasonably pay the miners in an environment with 0 inflation only exist in a world with consistently full blocks. Full stop.
I'm glad you've seen the light. I too hope block size will be increased eventually.

You can't even know the real climate impact. Maybe there will be so much money in the mining industry that companies will develop novel ways of recycling energy, selling heat, or incorporating mining with other useful activities, all which lead to greater energy efficiency throughout the world.
@_date: 2017-10-25 08:11:36
No you can't. If mining causes innovations in energy efficiency that are used elsewhere, the energy used by mining has to be offset by the efficiency gains elsewhere to calculate the true impact.

How is this at all like the prisoner's dilemma? It's a completely different problem.


At the scope of a single block, yes. But if you choose not to mine low fee transactions, then people will RBF or pay more in the future. Ask yourself why airlines or trains don't charge 10 cents to fill empty seats (analogous to free space in a block) in their plane. If they just sold seats for 10 cents, nobody would pay the higher price, just wait for them to be sold at 10 cents. Similarly, if blocks aren't full and miners are including any transaction with a nonzero fee, why would I ever pay more than the absolute minimum possible fee?


It's in the best interest of every miner to participate in the cartel if the miners are maximizing profit, which is what the system is designed for.

Upvoted for the good discussion.


I don't totally understand what you're saying here. How can something be a store of value if it does not already have value? Something is a store of value *because* it has value, not the other way around.


Hash power follows price. The incentive of mining is an arbitrage between the cost of hardware + electricity + etc. versus the market value of the coin you are mining. The electricity used to mine Bitcoin does not give it value. If that were the case, then the price of Bitcoin could literally not drop below the cost of the electricity to mine it (for any reasonable amount of time).


This is true, Bitcoin would almost certainly have a lower value if I had to exchange it through face to face barter.


Of course, but this does not constitute the majority of economic activity in Bitcoin, which is what this discussion is about. If *literally* every exchange started enforcing BIP148, and made no exceptions, the network would almost certainly fork. *That's* economic majority.
@_date: 2017-07-16 00:16:22
I think the issue isn't with the technicals of Segwit 2x. It's how it's been shoved down our throats and how it's been developed (closed source, etc.)
@_date: 2017-07-27 19:15:08
They do mean something. If there is not a single exchange and not a single merchant accepting Bitcoin as payment, the network has a value of exactly zero.
Exchanges and merchants are what give the network/your bitcoins value, and thus constitute the economic majority.
@_date: 2017-07-14 20:44:07
If you run a BIP148 node and are an Electrum server, that is definitely helping. As for BU, it will never happen, and if it does, nobody will use it, so I'm not too worried

Another one was just mined: 
@_date: 2017-05-31 00:07:33
The answer is that it depends. If we see extremely widespread support for BIP148 (most/all major exchanges, significant miner support) then then dip should be much shorter and less significant. Likewise, I think the swiftness with which the non-Segwit chain is killed (if at all) determines how soon and how much it will rise. Even if there are 2 chains though, I think that Bitcoin forking by UASF being shown to be possible is an ENORMOUS milestone in Bitcoin history and definitely in cryptocurrency history.

Well the fee will be about $2 and could take over an hour to get to where you want. But I only bought $20 worth... why is it so high? Oh because Bitcoin is controlled by like 5 dudes somewhere in China who make money off high fees, otherwise it would be about 3 cents and be nearly instant. But I just want to buy a game on Steam!

I understand but 0.3% hashpower won't last very long. Assuming it is listed, either the price will rise and hashpower will come along, or it will go to zero, in which case it doesn't matter. I know that I personally will buy any UASF coin that is listed and I'm sure many others will too so there's that. The hashpower it has now doesn't really mean anything.

Sorry, maybe we're just talking about 2 different things. I'm speaking specifically of if you already have coins present in your address at the time BIP148 is enforced, I'm under the impression that there is no risk of losing these coins. 
If I understand you, you mean that if you transact before one chain achieves overwhelming majority you are at risk of losing your coins because the chain you're transacting on may be reorged?

It would only be 1 block per day for like one day, the hashpower would be distributed according to the market price. Assuming people buy the BIP148 coin, the hashrate continues to increase relative to legacy chain.

They will continue to mine a big block chain even against "short term incentives". Either they really believe this is the right way forward or don't want to reveal the loss in hashpower from no longer having asicboost. They may also have enough resources to pump the price of the big block chain.
"The mining activity behind a UASF chain may stop without notice, and investors who buy in the BIP148 propaganda may lose all their investment. Any exchanges that decide to support a UASF token after the forking point need to consider the stagnation risk attached to it."
Basically he is scared and trying to spread FUD about the UASF coin. Scare exchanges from listing it and scaring people from buying it.

@_date: 2017-06-02 06:59:48
There's somewhat of a dilemma between showing mining support now (which will hopefully convince others to support) and affecting the difficulty. Basically, how much is your hashpower increasing the total hashpower/business support in favor of BIP148 and does that outweigh the potential harm caused by the difficulty adjustment?
@_date: 2017-06-05 03:48:46
Ah I see, thanks.

If I didn't live in one of the areas of the US with the highest electrical cost, I definitely would have some hash power.
@_date: 2017-06-04 18:13:15
The 51% attacking miner may only have a single node that is actually publicly facing the network. A single node does not constitute "the network".
@_date: 2017-06-11 21:00:46
Except as soon as people start buying the coin the hashrate will continue to switch over.
@_date: 2017-06-11 22:56:36
It's called marginal cost. At some point, the expected return from mining the UASF chain will be higher than mining the legacy chain. It's really pretty simple.
UASF chain has 1% of current total hashpower. Price begins to rise, reaches 100 bucks on exchanges, whereas legacy chain price is 2900. At this point, the hashrate distribution should have a ratio of 29:1, but it would currently be 99:1. This means that your expected profit in mining the UASF is far higher than mining the legacy chain, so hashrate switches until the hashrate distribution is equal to the price distribution. Traders say "oh look, hashrate is moving to UASF chain, maybe this thing can happen" and continue buying the UASF coin, the price continues to rise, and the hashrate continues to switch. Eventually the market will achieve an equilibrium as in the case of ETH/ETC, which was somewhere around 9 to 1 (different now). Whether that equilibrium results in there being two chains or one, nobody knows, but I'm willing to bet that the UASF chain will be the only one left.
@_date: 2017-06-12 06:53:18
The consensus mechanism is flawed however, when nearly every single person agrees the status quo sucks.
@_date: 2017-06-03 22:40:40
Yeah if BIP 148 fails I will also be moving on.
@_date: 2017-06-12 08:47:06
Probably, I'd imagine that one of the two chains will become worthless very quickly, in which case you won't need to worry about replay attacks. The only time you'll really need to worry is if both chains have value and you want to send coins on one but not the other. There should be ways around this though. I need to research a bit more...
@_date: 2017-06-07 00:55:49
Regardless of whether or not they are fake, they probably don't matter.
@_date: 2017-06-06 07:39:55
Right, so there you go. Do you want nearly guaranteed 90% returns, or a small chance at 100% returns if you time things perfectly.
@_date: 2017-06-10 21:47:35
Hashpower matters insofar as the hashpower is mining a valid chain. If everyone else (the economic majority or main liquidity providers, who validate the blocks that miners have constructed) says the blocks they are mining are invalid, then they are. Bitcoin is the longest chain of valid blocks.
Think of a hypothetical scenario where one guy wants to change the PoW algorithm. In that situation, he starts mining blocks with the new PoW algorithm and under these rules he has literally 100% of the hashpower. But obviously nobody will accept his blocks because they are invalid.
UASF is basically the users saying "if you aren't mining Segwit blocks, then your blocks are not valid in our eyes, so it doesn't matter how many or how fast you mine them, they are not part of OUR blockchain".
@_date: 2017-06-19 07:07:25
Segwit2x now has about 50% support.
@_date: 2017-06-05 04:29:58
In the case of Ethereum, the value of the original chain was split between the two chains.
I don't see the same thing happening with Bitcoin though due to difficulty readjustment stuff. I imagine one chain will become worthless. If the UASF chain is the one left standing, its value will rocket imo.
@_date: 2017-06-05 02:49:29
So basically the opposite of astroturfing. Sounds like you're the one spreading FUD. Why are you so against UASF anyway? Don't like users being empowered?
@_date: 2017-06-07 08:57:03
Why would exchanges care which coin ultimately wins or whether there is a chain split for that matter? If an exchange lists a BIP148 coin they will get a hell of a lot of volume I will say that. Charlie Lee at Coinbase/GDAX was in support of a UASF for Litecoin, so I can't imagine he is opposed in principle to one for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-05 18:01:12
1 of each bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-07 09:02:41
As much as I wish that were true, Segwit was activated on Litecoin through MASF. It may have been a UASF on Vertcoin though, need to investigate that.
@_date: 2017-06-12 06:03:17
If the coin is listed and the price goes up, miners will switch. As miners switch the price continues to go up and even more miners switch. An equilibrium will be achieved likely with both coins remaining functional.
@_date: 2017-06-03 22:45:58
Lol no it won't. Ethereum had a chain split and people lost money to replay attacks and what not. Who cares? They've now moved on...

@_date: 2017-06-04 06:06:22
A 51% attack is mainly used to double spend coins and/or censor transactions. A UASF is users choosing to enforce a different protocol than the rules under which a majority of hashpower is constructing blocks. A 51% attack can't change the protocol rules.
Also a UASF has nothing to do with computing power so I don't understand the link.
@_date: 2017-06-10 01:02:31
If every other node says the blocks the hashpower is mining are not valid, doesn't matter how much hashpower is mining them, they aren't part of the main chain.

@_date: 2017-06-21 05:38:00
Everyone that has bitcoin on an exchange would have UASF coin. People start buying UASF coin. The state where there is no hashpower would last for a matter of hours.
@_date: 2017-06-10 19:11:25
The real world isn't that simple. Good luck getting hashrate without supporting Bitmain who will reinvest the profit they make off of you into AsicBoost hardware that will make your hashrate obsolete.
@_date: 2017-06-04 07:28:39


No, it doesn't.


This is not a protocol change and not technically a soft fork. Nodes would not be *enforcing* the rule that all blocks must be below 1KB, it would just so happen that all the blocks being mined are under 1KB. See: 


I won't debate with you on what is and isn't Bitcoin because that isn't well defined.
@_date: 2017-06-12 05:48:59
It's speculators buying the coins, most of them don't care if their coins are on the exchange. Anyone who isn't speculating has them in a wallet, in which case they will already have UASF coins.
Nobody will be using BIP148 coins for DNM purchases because nobody is accepting BIP148 coins (yet), so the only people moving them are arbitragers and speculators. If the price goes up, this will slowly change as hashpower continues to switch over due to:
* People wanting to move their BIP148 coins and paying absurdly high fees to do so (incentivising miners to switch). If everybody wants to get in the single block that day, people will be continually setting a higher and higher fee to move their coins. At a certain point, there will be an enormous amount of money just sitting for the taking in the mempool and a miner **will** begin to mine these blocks.
* Expected mining profit being higher mining the BIP148 chain because the ratio of price and hashpower is different. There is no way that a BIP148 coin will be listed and be &lt;1% of the cost of the legacy chain, it will be higher, and therefore miners will switch.

Got a citation for that speculation about why no exchanges have supported it yet?
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:26:39
It theoretically could go higher and higher forever. When it crossed $100 people were probably like "oh I bet it will drop to $80 again" with absolutely no reasoning other than hope. It will probably never go below 100 again unless its going to 0. It could also never go to 2500 again unless it's going to 0. The question is: What do you think the value of Bitcoin actually is and why? Come up with your answer, then act accordingly.

Thank you waterhole. It seems you have a good amount of hashrate, I would be very appreciative if you also signaled UASF. That would bring us closer to 1% hashrate and that much closer to segwit.
@_date: 2017-06-12 01:31:06
Do *you* know how difficulty adjustment works? Did you even read my previous post? The UASF chain would have 1% hashrate for probably only a few hours, at which point it would begin to increase due to increasing price from speculation. Hashrate might increase to 30% (probably even more) or something who knows, in which case it takes 3 times longer to reach 2016 blocks (6 weeks), but not 1.5 years.
EDIT: But I do start to see a trend in BIP148 opposers... Low reading comprehension or willful ignorance. Lack of understanding of high school economics/game theory. Complacency in the face of manipulation by malicious miners.
@_date: 2017-06-13 06:31:07

Luke has almost nothing to do with the actual principle behind a UASF. Character attacking Luke as a way to attack UASF is just ridiculous FUD. Regardless of what Luke says, BIP148 will give control back to Bitcoin users.

How is that at all the same? I like Monero because of the tech. In the case of Trezor vs. Ledger, the tech is about the same so I'd rather support someone that I like. Even if Ledger Nano S is cheaper it doesn't really matter to me, considering in the end I'd say I'm enriching myself by supporting someone who works in my best interest. I respect the way Slush gives the miners in his pool a lot of choice and I like that he seems to support UASF, so he gets my business.
Brainless idiots buying things with the lowest price instead of considering the real cost of things is why this world is controlled by corrupt assholes anyway. Trying to make it better.

How does a UASF even remotely resemble a 51% attack?
@_date: 2017-06-12 07:22:10
I think we're stuck at a local minima in the consensus. Basically everyone knows we can do better, but we can't muster enough activation energy to find a better place to be. We need something sufficiently disrupting to actually create some change, whether this be a chain split with UASF, the flippening, a price crash, Segwit2x, whatever, I don't really know. Even with the flippening though, mining profits will continue to reach all time highs even as the price goes up, and so I don't see anything changing unless miners really start to hurt.
Oh, and obligatory plug for UASF^UASF^UASF^UASF^UASF^UASF^UASF^UASF^UASF^UASF^UASF^UASF^UASF^UASF^UASF^UASF^UASF^UASF^UASF^UASF
