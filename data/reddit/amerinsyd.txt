@_date: 2015-06-18 00:28:01
Yeah, I have bought over that from the chase account, but I haven't used the withdrawal feature since I'm holding for the long-term.
@_date: 2015-06-19 13:41:36
Thank you I gladly accept 
@_date: 2015-06-10 17:53:32
I wish I was compensated

@_date: 2015-06-19 17:03:16
True. I'm new to bitcoin so this seems like a good way to get my feet wet.

Everything has to start somewhere. Most things take time to be accepted. Some just realize the potential faster than others. I'm sure the first person to try anal thought it was strange and different, but now there are loads of people doing it. Thank you. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 02:06:40
Thanks, that's what I was wondering

No, I have 100 instant limit and 2,500 daily limit :( I wish I had more and didn't have to wait days for it to go through.
@_date: 2015-06-18 01:54:35
Does this affect Copay?
@_date: 2015-06-12 03:34:33
does anyone here even lift?
@_date: 2015-06-09 21:06:18
I think we should do a Super Bowl or World Cup ad. It would be pricey, but I'd put some money into it. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 14:28:14
I know that it had succeeded already but I meant of there was anything that would make you question if it would continue succeeding 
@_date: 2015-06-06 03:40:52
ma'am settle down
@_date: 2015-06-11 14:38:04
I hope so there's some people I'd like to say I told you so to
@_date: 2015-06-08 21:35:39
I've never used their withdrawal feature just deposit and that takes me like 4-5 days to go through. It's not instant like emporium said unless you buy less than $100. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 21:10:01

I use chase and have circle. My chase account is fine. However, at one point the chase account got disconnected from the circle account for some reason (not sure if chase took away circles access to my account) so i had to reconnect it. Other than that everything has been ok so far.
