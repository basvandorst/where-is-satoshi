We are already working on  which is an open source way to support artists and make street art more interactive for the street art enthusiast. We are working on several ways for artists to incorporate a signature into their QR code, as well as create a verifiable database that can be checked online. 
Furthermore, artists can secure wall sponsorship by offering the wall owner a percentage of the donations. Since the wallet is viewable on the blockchain everything is transparent. For artists that are already commercially successful and command a lot of attention, we recommend accepting donations for charity. 
The program is young but we are working on an ap as well, with an interactive map. If you are an artist who wishes to participate please contact us through the website.

This could change the way that street art works. Currently, commercially successful artists get to use cherrypickers and spend days working on murals, on sponsored walls, without fear of legal action. 
Now, smaller artists who are talented but have no reputation can provide an incentive to wall owners in the form of a percentage of all donations generated by the art. If they wish to paint something agreeably tasteful both parties will be happy. It may take a while for this to catch on, but it could have a really positive impact in the street art world.

Great idea, we'll mention it to the artists and see if we can get some participation.
