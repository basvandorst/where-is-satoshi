He doesnt say that. he just says that by definition it is not a dictatorship. call it what it is corrupt/horrible/etc but use the correct tems

The problem is people here believe this shit and then spew it out to other people when they talk about bitcoin

Hell, look at saying it be worth thousands of dollars in months. It has no real value to speak of right now just the opportunity for value  in the future and by future I mean years like 5-10.

@_date: 2013-07-07 21:01:01
Well yes Hitler, while a vile human being to say the least, was not a dictator. If you want to use a term name best use the correct one.

I'm sorry but the only people you will find here are people who will tell you to "buy buy buy" "you're so lucky it's low you can buy more""bitcoin to the moon!" ... a place like this is not good for legit investment advice.

a commend you for knowing/seeing that a good/possible is not assured for anything let alone a infant currency.
@_date: 2013-11-08 18:34:46
or you're a shill
