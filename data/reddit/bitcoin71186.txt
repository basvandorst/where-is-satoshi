You know why? Because "professional" companies like Bitfinex communicate to their users over Reddit with a 20 year old spokesman.
@_date: 2016-04-16 02:08:55
Wow its destroying eBay and Amazon already
@_date: 2016-04-22 22:47:27
Yea just look at how well AOL is doing! It's been around for almost 20 years and still doing amazing!
@_date: 2015-12-01 18:25:19
Ugh, bunch of statists in this thread.

LN is like Sidechains. More vaporware that isn't going to materialize.
@_date: 2015-12-17 01:21:49
Jeeze Eragmus, why are you so butthurt about your buddy losing his modship in another sub?
@_date: 2015-12-15 21:06:08
I am, because this sounds so stdh.txt
Are you behind 7 proxies also? 
@_date: 2015-12-07 17:54:40
Remember when Bitstamp said they thought about moving to BIP101 and Theymos said straight up if they did he would ban them from here?
@_date: 2015-12-07 20:22:42
Possibly the dumbest comparison of the day
@_date: 2015-12-10 23:33:30
Paging to tell me how this sub isn't totally an echo chamber of this self-fellating crap.
@_date: 2015-12-03 14:48:27
Oh man, and the horrors of having to stand in line at amusement parks, the grocery store, and home depot. How can we decentralize those too?
@_date: 2015-12-15 19:01:31
Quick! Run to Reddit to cry about it! Thats what all the professionals do!
@_date: 2015-12-15 20:38:20
LOL, the cognitive dissonance in your post is astounding. "Sorry you lost thousands of dollars cause of some shit, but don't worry! Bitcoin i s still the best! Keep at it!"
Like hes not entirely turned off of it now.
@_date: 2015-12-03 05:16:31
Why would I want my toaster to pay satoshis to my fridge? Why wouldn't it just be free?
@_date: 2015-12-15 19:03:13
I thought Bruce "Bruce Fenton" Fenton was supposed to fix all this?
@_date: 2015-12-10 23:30:57
Why does this sub think that banks are literally hoarding ginormous vaults of paper money? A majority of "Cash" is already held electronically by banks.
@_date: 2015-12-03 19:29:49
Lol, invest in Reynolds Wrap, you need some.
@_date: 2015-12-03 05:02:14
I don't understand why the SEC is involved. The free market will just naturally weed out bad actors and nobody will do business with Garza again
@_date: 2016-03-14 14:35:09
Who is next? Dell? TigerDirect? People are right to be concerned that a large corporation stopped accepting it.
@_date: 2016-03-20 15:14:05
Its pretty true. 2 years ago Bitpay released stats on the amount of transactions they process, and it was utterly dwarfed by the amount of dark net transactions.
@_date: 2016-03-28 02:08:37
Dude is never getting out. 
@_date: 2016-03-07 19:42:39
Should be 15% discount for btc
@_date: 2016-03-23 03:20:57
Lol, so sick of hearing "KILLER APP!" 
@_date: 2016-03-20 18:01:57
Except their chart was based on the total # of Bitcoin transactions on the blockchain, and "unknown" transactions only made up about 20% of uses, the rest going to Coinbase, Bitpay, Exchanges and DNMs.
@_date: 2016-03-26 23:14:00
That attitude is definitely going to make people convert to using OB.
@_date: 2016-03-27 00:48:43
Total FUD from Classic followers.
@_date: 2016-01-22 18:13:47
Price goes up: "Its the fundamentals!"
Price goes down: "Manipulations!!"
@_date: 2016-03-14 14:34:12
Remember when Microsoft said it was "Committed" to Bitcoin and exploring other uses? 
Just LOL, people ate that up.
@_date: 2016-01-21 05:33:53
Seriously? 
@_date: 2016-03-28 23:34:55
The free market works.
@_date: 2016-03-24 16:21:16
Wow I can't imagine why more people aren't getting into Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-01-15 17:32:16
Wow, this whole decentralized free market reputation based system keeps on working so well!
@_date: 2016-01-26 14:36:53
@_date: 2016-11-27 00:51:24
You know maybe instead of bitching, someone should write a counter submission
@_date: 2016-12-17 03:59:02
I remember the original thread where you did this had you refusing to pay the guy who did the work
@_date: 2016-12-16 22:34:22
Didn't you welch out on paying the person?
@_date: 2016-02-04 05:16:37
I would argue that if you can't buy human slaves with your money, then it's not actually money!
@_date: 2016-02-09 11:37:36
And you need to read up on a previous soft fork which when activated caused a bug that literally created two chains for a few days, thus an actual hard fork until it was resolved.
@_date: 2016-02-04 05:17:01
Oh sweet more middle men to use BTC
@_date: 2017-04-13 17:40:12
@_date: 2015-11-23 19:01:03
This time for realsies! We're totally gunna abandon ship for Voat! Super duper serial!
@_date: 2015-11-29 08:55:12
People have been saying this since day 1, and its crap. Bitcoin Remittance companies have already come out and said that Bitcoin didn't actually make remittances easier or cheaper compared to Western Union, but that news was downvoted by this sub
@_date: 2015-11-19 23:13:53
Wow, Reynolds Wrap should sponsor the comments in this thread.
@_date: 2015-11-28 21:03:24
Maybe you should try actually reading the agreement when a user makes a Bitstamp account, it says they reserve the right to do exactly this.
