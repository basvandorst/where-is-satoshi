It's not in my account, and I tried making another transaction and it wont let me.

Actually it was about 2 months ago that I sent it. I think it's failing but blockchain.info keeps sending it out.


How do I do that?


Notice other people were saying the same thing over a month ago. The 'received time' keep changing.

It's been over a month now. They're still floating in the nether.
They're not in any of my wallets.

It's been two weeks now, how long does it take to expire?

It appears in my blockchain.info wallet as having been sent. It appears as unconfirmed.
I sent that out 2 months ago.

As in they're not in any of my wallets. I sent them from one wallet to another wallet I own and am waiting to receive them.

According to blockchain.info the transaction is still out there and unconfirmed.

Ah, thanks. I imported the key and it shows my balance as it should be.

Guess it's a good thing bitcoin is open source and can't be controlled.

Not according to the wiki.

It used to be voluntary, now it's required by all clients. Why? I just tried the bitcoin client the other day and it demanded I set a fee of at least 0.0001 btc.

It said transfer fees are voluntary and you had the option of not paying it.
