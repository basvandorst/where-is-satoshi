No, no, no... I didn't say anything about anytime soon. I just calculated how long you should wait for the bandwidth version of moore's law to improve things so that we can grow block sizes big enough to hold 1700 tx/s. It's at least 35 years.
Are you suggesting that even in 35 years Bitcoin is not going to challenge even one of major fiat transaction handlers? What is the point of this currency anyway then?
That point about how many people should run full nodes, that comes down to what you want from the network. I believe that having as many nodes as possible is always better. But what I'm trying to say here is that if having a node has a certain dollar cost and it is almost constant through time, taking into account moore's law and everything, then it is okay no matter what the exact number is. But the way thing are right now and especially if we go for a bigger block, the dollar cost is going to increase through time making it harder and harder to have a full node to a point when in a few years almost no one can afford to run it except a handful of organizations. At that point they can become points-of-failure of the system. Governments will try to influence them and bad actors will try to target them with denial of service or even plain old social engineering. Remember that if you control a lot of nodes you can literally "create money out of nowhere" and there is no validation against it. That is all the incentive bad actors need and the only thing stopping them now is that it is impossible to track down and trick most people that are running nodes.

Not really.
Grover's algorithm will make searching for what is hashed an O(k^(n/2)) operation. SHA256 and other hash functions are already designed to be safe in O(K^(n/2)) due to birthday paradox to be safe against collision attacks.
It is probably going to bump the difficulty though.

I know, but still I don't see terabyte bandwidth caps and cheap tens-of-terabyte storage coming anytime soon to most people's houses. Maybe in 10 years, but not now. The idea is that keep it at a level that today's off the shelf hardware could run a full node.
As it is right now, Bitcoin growth is exponential and hardware (and bandwidth) growth is no longer exponential, it's a losing race unless we have a major breakthrough (e.g. as big as what invention of silicon transistors was) or hit a hard limit on how many people using Bitcoin (e.g. not more than a few million people use it and it stops spreading to new people.) Otherwise only way is to keep most transactions off the chain.

You *are* going downloading and uploading that much. There in no network unless you actually communicate with quite a few other nodes.
And what would 8MB do? increase number of transactions per block 8 times? Then what, bitcoin will support ~26 transactions/second? For context Paypal has about 200tx/s and Visa does about 1700tx/s. What are we gonna do next? increase it to 80MB per block and then to 800MB per block? This ain't going to work brother.
@_date: 2017-08-27 20:29:58
In the last 7 days BCH had 22.88 transactions per block. That's like 2 transactions per *minute* :D
Moore's law. Okay. Good start. Let's talk numbers. [Average bandwidth in US and UK doubles every three to four years]( That is a rate of 20%. Even if we assume every other country has a growth this fast (spoiler: they don't, average is at best 17%) and seed data for a node does not grow faster that what people can download in the same time (which cannot be achieved with a block size &gt; ~500KB) that means that we have to wait the better half of the next century (&gt; 35 years) before having blocks big enough that we can handle as many transaction as Visa.
the numbers don't add up. The only way is to either find a way to magically shrink transaction information or have some sort of off-chain solution for big bulk of transactions. Please inform me if you see any other way around it.

Still not government-scale. If I were a dictator head of state that a lot of other powerful countries really wanted me to go away, I would not bother with mining, just stealing from the budget and buying bitcoins, gold and stuff and hiding tangibles in countries that I might have to flee to in short notice.
But that means that it still doesn't make sense to play with lions tail (e.g. shooting missiles over Japan) just to get a 6% increase in just a portion of their rainy day funds. If they ever have to actually use the "exile-funds" it means that the metaphorical excrement have already hit the fan and they have lost a whole country.

They don't own the satellites. They bought bandwidth from conventional communications satellites.
@_date: 2017-08-27 09:43:21
The problem with that is that it is too shortsighted, yes you might be okay now, but:
1. Doubling the block size doesn't help when number of people using bitcoin is growing exponentially, it's not sustainable in the long run.
2. It will grow the blockchain faster than average bandwidth grows, making operating a node diverge much more faster than now from what an average user can afford.
The only way I can see this working is that if I was sure that the number of people using Bitcoin is never going to go any higher. Then again if I thought that was the case it wouldn't have any future.

I live in Finland and we don't have nominal data caps either, but that's just your ISP hiding it from you. As I said, search in your ISP contracts (that you didn't read before signing) for "fair use policy". There is no such thing as free bandwidth.
Edit: It's like e.g. Gmail saying it has unlimited storage for your emails. They don't and can't have "unlimited" storage. If you store terabytes of emails they will ask you to pay up or shut down your account. Same thing with bandwidth, if one in a hundred user starts doing terabytes/month, they can't sustain it.
Source: I wrote the actual piece of software that tracks how many bytes you moved around (a RADIUS AAA server) for one of these "unmetered" ISPs. I worked at one. I know how it is.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:10:50
Ummm... there is no Raspberry Pi 4... And let's assume there is, a blocksize of 20MB needs 680-ish GB bandwidth per month and about an extra terabyte of storage per year.
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:33:39
Well, if you use a terabyte of bandwidth, I'm pretty sure your "uncapped" or "unmetered" connection will go down, or the ISP calls and tries to extort more money out of you. Are you simple enough to think "free bandwidth" exists?
Look into the "I agree" thing you signed for your ISP for the term "fair use policy".

Grover's algorithm makes it an O(sqrt(N)) so it takes O( 2^190-ish ) QC. Still unbreakable. For this specific problem quantum computers don't offer much (no exponential speedups.)

Even if North Korea magically acquires ownership of literally all the bitcoins that has ever been mined, at current price it would pay for about 6 years of their military budget. It just doesn't make any sense for any sort of government scale use. Someone high up might own some as a sort of security or backup plan just in case, but that's about it.
@_date: 2017-08-26 22:49:23


Are you aware that in a realistic case you would need more than a terabyte of bandwidth cap to actually run the node i.e. communicate with a few other nodes?

I'm sorry, but last I checked no country that I know of has banned building toll-free roads or providing free healthcare or care for the elderly. What country are you from? I must have missed that masterpiece of a legislation.
No one does these because they don't "pay well". As to why you are forced, that's how a democracy works, let alone other forms of government. Collective good is not always in every ones favor as much as everyone else. Even if one never uses any road, sewer or hospital, and they are sure they never would, one would rightly be an asshole if they don't care about well being of many other people by means of getting a little less rich.
As for solutions, go fund Mars colonization plans or move to some other country where they have enough oil not to care for your tax money.

It's about [this chart](
This is a back of the envelope estimation based on current bandwidth rate of growth (which there is no guarantee that it is going to stay the same) and maximum possible initial sync time (which everyone that has ever tried to run a full node knows it gets at least a 5x multiplier).
If continue with 1MB block, starting a node will not be much worse in the near future. We might even be able to pull off a block size increase if we wait a little bit for the broadband to catch up, meaning that the effects would be subtle. But if we increase block size by e.g. 10x, which would give a meager 30-ish transactions per second, we are going to make it impossible to run a node by mere mortals in 20 years. It's going to take months to complete initial sync.
Same story goes for storage. Degree of sensitivity might be different, just imagine the same plot with Y axis representing storage costs. The dynamics is the same since storage seems to be following a similar exponential growth pattern for now, until we reach a physical limit a la CPUs.
Also, don't assume tech growth will stay like. More likely that we will hit roadblocks that will slow down growth bandwidth or storage technology. Average speed of cars is not going up 10% per year because we there is a physical limit on fuel energy density and human reaction time, so the rate of growth has slowed down.
TL;DR: It's going to be expensive and taking too damn long to run a full node, which will lead to ever more people relying on a few companies' nodes.

Government, by definition, is a [monopoly on violence]( We tried other systems a few hundred years ago, they didn't work.


Using public services (roads, education, security) that *my* tax money is paying for and not chugging up your share of the burden, now *that* is stealing money. By not paying your taxes you are not being a smart-ass anarcho-rebel. You are just making other, more responsible adults pay for you.

OK. So let's take the simple case of two people wanting to have a channel of sending small amounts of money back and fourth. These two can set up a channel in a way that:
1. If both parties decide to terminate the relationship and settle the accounts, they can bunch them up in one transaction and that will be it.
2. If one side decides to terminate the relation any time even without the other side knowing (e.g. the other side is offline and not responding) without cheating, they can just go ahead and do this. They will have to wait some time and give the other side a chance to argue if they are cheating.
3. If someone is cheating (sending a transaction older than the most recent balance of the channel, e.g. you bought two cups of coffee but transmitted the transaction from the time that you had bought only one cup) then the other side has that "argue time" to take all the money (It's a sort of penalty for breaching the contract).
"Network" part of it (having indirect connections and transactions) comes through some cryptographic slight of hand but the idea remains the same. You don't need to trust anyone (well maybe you have to trust the person you are buying coffee that they are actually giving you coffee in the end) or stay committed to a channel.
A problem I have seen people say: What if I cannot keep checking if the other side has cheated or not and my "argue time" expires? Well, the numbers that people are throwing around in the documents are about ~1000 blocks or about a week. If you cannot get online in a week, there will be services out there that can do it for you without you trusting them, but they might need you to give them a share of any penalty if that happens.

They do. All transactions, import or export to "embargoed countries and regions" require them to make sure in dealing with you they are in compliance with all the shit; e.g. you don't have anything to do with Syrian government, the petroleum industry, The Commercial Bank of Syria and a long list of other people and groups, and they have to make sure it does not constitute "exporting products except food and medicine" and "operating within Syria", neither are well defined and the only way to find out if e.g. selling Bitcoin is export or not is going to court against federal government.

There is mention of this news in Iranian news agencies, but don't get your hopes up, it's just about "running a few studies about having the infrastructure to use Bitcoin" which means after 12 years they are going to run a SPV and a couple of transactions and show it off as a huge achievement.

Amazon has around 600 purchases per seconds on peak time. Bitcoin with a 1MB block can handle around 2000 transaction per block or ~3.3 transactions per second. To be able to handle 10% of Amazon peak transactions (on chain) you would need 20x or 30x the block size, which would make running a full nodes practically impossible in 2 or 3 years.

If you have a safe, that seems good. I would say it's good to have two copies, one somewhere else (e.g. your parents' safe) in case you or your house are in a situation that the original copy is not usable anymore (e.g. flood, earthquake, lost wallet etc.)
Some banks also offer safe deposit boxes. That is also a good location for a backup.

No. That is not another option. That's playing politics.
Imagine there was an Abbathabad agreement with 93% hashrate support that wanted to decrease block size to 20KB and kill Segregated Witness. Would you be okay with that? Probably not, because the long term problem with that is easy to see. The tricky part is that when you have a system that is going to last at least a hundred years with so many variables, it gets much harder to predict the behaviour of the system. Modifications that look pretty safe suddenly change the equations that make e.g. setting up a new node technologically impossible in 10 years or something to that effect. That's why every single simple proposal takes forever to go through and be released.
And that's exactly why no sane core developer will be happy to just agree to write the code just because you said "please". People that actually get shit done (e.g. write software) are engineers or scientists.

We don't compromise in the way that politicians compromise. We consider the most probable range of consequences and tune the options we have based on that.

No. We should treat it like a science/engineering problem. Businesses show irrational behaviour all the time because a compromise between two relatively rational choices, a political mean of resolving conflict in nature, more often than not produces irrational solutions. It's okay because businesses are not built to last more than two or three decades and they rarely do. Bitcoin *is* designed to last long.


"Changing from 1 to 2" WILL have real consensuses. Storage technology might slow it's happy and upward exponential in two years or it might not. We might get as much growth in bandwidth to compensate for this or we might not. Your "compromise" solution does not address any of the actual issues but sees everything as a power struggle. It's only line of reasoning is to make everyone *feel better*. it's as if we can go back in time and fix everything with fairy dust and unicorn farts when we see the actual consequences of the choice.
Compromise is not a good thing. It's illogical, political, fragile and a human gesture with no place in scientific discourse.

Naah, I was not making a serious size assumption here, but the general idea is that Amazon probably thinks about enabling Bitcoin purchase in scale as they would think about using a payment provider that is not up to their scale yet. They would think twice, then think again, before committing to anything. Simply because every time some random customer has any kind of problem with the payment method (say, there is a huge peak in using Bitcoin on Amazon for some reason, e.g. a relatively sizeable country starts to have huge monetary problems) they have to spend a lot of money on customer support. It is also very expensive to train support staff and incorporate a payment method that would form a fraction of a percent of total transaction volume and most people using it have other means of transactions. If you say they it is going to take years until it reaches usage on the scale that would register on their radars, and it is going to change significantly until that time, then they probably are better off just waiting for a few years.
My point more or less was kinda similar to yours though. There is no way we are going to have any significant increase in transactions and adoption on this kind of scale, unless we have some means of fast off-chain transaction.

They are not. A model is a way for us to predict how a system evolves. A model here is e.g. to say "bandwidth and storage will keep improving in the next 30 years with the same rate". There are different models that different people adhere to. Depending on which model is better at predicting future, it is clear that for example 2X will grow the blockchain way too fast, or maybe we need to have a 100X just because we can.
Now, we can never say that a model is accurate, specially since we live in one world and have one shot at this whole predicting game. The law of averages don't apply when you have only one sample. Therefore as I said "We consider the most probable range of consequences and tune the options we have based on that".
Another approach is to throw all of this out of the window and make people feel happy and powerful, e.g. to think that if we let the core developers do the 2X thing then it's all good. This might work for in an average student union meeting, but that's clearly a sub-par "human" approach to solving issues.
