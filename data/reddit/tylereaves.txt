This is an incredibly naive and short-sited view of hardware specifications. *Consumer gear is not designed or specced for 100% duty cycles*. Do you think it would shorten the life of your car stereo if you played it full volume 24/7? 
@_date: 2014-04-03 06:15:30
Uh, car stereos aren't solid state? How exactly do you classify a transistor op-amp circuit?

Don't forget the block reward halving in &lt;6 months. I seriously doubt that  that will cause BTC prices to double.

That's not how leverage works.
@_date: 2012-10-31 19:21:25
This statement isn't at all correct.
A market cap doesn't mean much if theres no market to actual absorb a sale.
If even 10% of the held bitcoins were sold (possibly much less), it would completely crash the market.

Mining isn't a business.
Anyone trying to make money mining in the long term isn't thinking things through.

Just save yourself the time and effort and send me all of your money. 
Currency trading is a zero sum (actually worse than zero-sum due to the fees) game. How do you expect to win that game the "quick" way without an informational advantage.
@_date: 2012-10-02 14:43:44
Yea, you *don't get it*. The trader doesn't lose more than their initial stake. If the position goes down more than the inverse of the leverage (e.g. 0.1% if using 1000:1), the position is immediately liquidated. The site loses nothing. The trader loses everything.
@_date: 2012-10-16 13:32:33
Do note that defacing currency is a crime in most places...

But wait, if you have 100k to throw at BTC just to experiment, 5k should be nothing, right? Unless you're a lying twat who's out to karma whore.

It's more about it being a teaming hive of scammers, opportunists, etc. The amount of bad faith in the bitcoin community is simply staggering. 
That, and I consider the fact that it takes ~1 hour to fully confirm a transaction to be more or less completely deal breaking for many of the uses it's put forth for. No one serious about ecommerce will accept that.

Who needs facts and logic when you have RAVING MINDLESS ENTHUSIASM?

How about when all the speculators get bored and people realize they can't actually *do* anything with their coins?

I would suggest not making things that LOOK like a physical bitcoin that arne't. If it was just a disc with the bitcoin logo on it, fine. But stamping a number in the other side? And making a "5" that's thicker/heavier than the "1". You don't see the potential for, if we're generous, honest confusion that these are actual bitcoins?

Chess is a terrible game for gambling, as it takes only a relatively small edge in skill to have a decisive advantage.
Backgammon, on the other hand, is a wonderful game, as the inherit randomness introduces enough of a luck factor that the weaker player has a real chance - to a point - a novice vs an expert is still mostly hopeless). If player B is twice as good as player A, at backgammon he might win 3 games in 4, perhaps even 2 in 3, but in chess, more like 19/20.

So, in other words, incompetence. If the Feds ain't happy, ain't nobody happy.

To  a much lessor extent. The liability cutoff for a debit card is typically 48 hours vs 30 days for a CC. Don't notice within 2 days? Tough

Eh, not really. Offering a real credit card processor would add credibility. PayPal is the definition of lowest common denominator.

Bet the banker bet in Baccarat - well under 1%. If allowing high free odds bets the Pass/Don't Pass in Craps + Maximum free odds can get the total house edge on money wagered under 0.1%. Those are just two examples that don't require any sort of strategy or memorization.

$100k buys you a lot less than you might think. At contractor rates that might get you one good dev for 6-9 months.

They certainly exist. imagine a wingnut (who, by definition, aren't exactly the brightest, most logical people), having heard about bitcoin on some right-wing radio show, gets offerened some of these...

Because people with something to lose don't want the risk exposure.

Isn't this rather dangerous? You know someone is going to try to pass these as (actual) bitcoins

You're completely and utterly wrong. You're confusing past results with future odds. The dice have no memory. Over a long enough turn, everyone loses. That's what a negative sum game means.

Posts like this is are why people laugh at your average bitcoin proponent. The level of financial naiveté is way up there. 
First off, what matters is liquid assets, not wealth. 
Even ignoring that, you understand that your "small amount of corporations or pension funds" is equivalent to 8,900 Warren Buffets, or 7,400 Bill Gateses? Or 6,921,086,675 average American households?

1.9% is not an especially low house edge, compared to something like Blackjack or Baccarat.

Said accounting is A LOT more complicated when said payment system in not denominated in what you do business in, and has a wildly fluctuating exchange rate.

Yes, such an upward trend it lost 20% in the last week. 
Calling ANYTHING a swing when you're frequently seeing 10-15% intra-day swings is crazy.

Actually, no it's not, not for anyone following proper corporate accounting.
