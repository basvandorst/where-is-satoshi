I’m surprised it took this long for the feds to launch an investigation.

Yeah bias is showing.

The moment I can walk into a gas station and recharge a bitcoin card that won’t get stolen or hacked in 13 seconds then it’s easy to access.

Global economy collapse would mean massive riots and unrest. First thing people loot is tangible good to survive and barter with, not make believe bits.

Scamcoin taking a massive shit today. Enjoy the coronary boys ��

Well retailer gets bitcoin that so many tout as the future of our currency and coverts it quickly to avoid losing value. The analogy about garage sale is one of quickly converting to something stable before it gets destroyed.

Looks like somebody is trying to pump and dump soon. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:22:12
Lol and not even a thank you card :)

Ironic that bitcoin gets converted so quickly to preserve value. It’s like having a garage sale during a fire.

Delusional.

Same here. I can go to the bank and deposit cash or check and then use my card to purchase pretty much anything.  Try that with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:10:40
Do you not use debit cards?
@_date: 2018-06-11 18:20:26
This already happens. It’s called stock options or a 401K that has ownership in the company.

Liberal lunacy. Without capital there is literally NOTHING that workers work on. Get a clue.

If you are so convinced of it’s longevity and “here to stay” vibe please convert all of your retirement accounts to bitcoin and report back in 20-30 years. I’ll wait.  
@_date: 2019-02-10 12:59:17
And you don’t invest to lose...

I get it and your passion but understand one thing, Bitcoin right now is a neat experiment but don’t fool yourself thinking it’s the currency of the future. One day we will have a digital currency but it will be issued and controlled by governments, not “the people”.

Looks like that guy is waiting for some fools to pump so they can unload.

Yeah one is backed by real tangible assets and one is backed frothing neckbeards, scammers and money launderers.
