I mean I hear that good things come to those who pass on good karma......

Careful not to chafe too much. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 01:04:38
That was awfully nice
@_date: 2014-11-01 18:53:36
Seriously. There is no reason to jump all over you for saying something that is completely valid.

This may be a stupid question, but what's my incentive for spending $200-$300 bucks?
@_date: 2016-01-14 19:36:28
Ah I see, I thought it was Bitcoin exclusive. 
@_date: 2016-01-14 19:14:22
So it's investing in the idea of bitcoin. That's what I thought, but that doesn't seem like enough motivation people to go build one of these. 
@_date: 2016-02-22 22:26:33
Any way to get rid of that?

I agree, right now I got a postit note.
* bought .01btc
* bought .01btc
Etc etc etc.

Hey man looks amazing! Great work! 
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:43:34
I thought you were referring to the order limits that coinbase or other sites impose. My apologies. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:08:30
Or you could do it by hand...? 
@_date: 2013-12-12 08:16:40
Heck, if we as bitcoin holders want to increase the value of what we have we should be doing this. The more people there are the more our coins are worth! 
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:07:44
Well not sure about you but there is no way that I'm going to be able to turn my $25 into something where I would be able to buy more than 50BTC at once. 
Or am I missing the point of your comment?
