I rebooted today after upgrading to 0.12.  Using the console of my Bitcoin application;


Does indeed return the transaction hexstring?  I suppose that means it is indeed in my mempool (where else would it come from?).
  "size": 15244,
  "bytes": 139702343,
  "usage": 299364320,
  "maxmempool": 300000000,
  "mempoolminfee": 0.00000000
One wonders how to clean this out.

Anyone can put their own test string in cell A2; the sheet will calculate the SHA256 hash and the value will appear in cell B2 in a few seconds.

Over a pretty short amount of time, just a day or so, my Bitcoin application, automatically raised mempoolminfee to 0.00001962 and now the transaction in question is no longer in my mempool.  So, *if* everyone ran with comparable software then the transaction wouldn't be in anyone's mempool.  Perhaps tradeblock.com ought to use this.

Blockchain.info  indicates "Transaction rejected by our node. Reason: The Maximum Very Small Inputs Exceeded. Expected at least (150000) satoshi fee".

It's my memory; I've only got so much; cluttering it up with such things is a waste.  Etc.  Why do you care if I worry about it?

Would it kill us to increase the block size from 1MB to 1.1MB and see what effect that has?  If it feels good then try 1.2MB.  Jumping from 1MB to 2MB all at once isn't really necessary, right?  Seriously, I'm not trying to slow down SegWit; the sooner that goes through the better but counting on it alone is problematic.
