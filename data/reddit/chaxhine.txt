Take a look at this FAQ entry: 
"You may see more than one Coinbase or Dwolla transaction for each purchase you make with your Shift Card. 
To prevent fraud, some merchants such as rental car agencies, gas stations and restaurants notify the VISA network to 'hold' a dollar amount that is more than what may be presented on your initial bill. Therefore, your Coinbase or Dwolla account may be temporarily debited for more than you expected. As the final transaction amount is settled over the VISA network (usually within 24 hours), Shift immediately settles up, debiting or crediting your Coinbase or Dwolla account to match your final bill."

The speaker's voice is unfortunately overpowered by background chatter.

The difference is on the merchant side.
My coffee shop chooses to pay Visa's network fee. Your coffee shop chooses to accept bitcoin.

"When you use your Shift debit card to make a purchase, the equivalent value of bitcoin (based on the current spot price of bitcoin on Coinbase) will be debited from your Coinbase wallet."

Cardholders do not need to pre-convert bitcoin to USD. If you spend $10 using the Shift Card, $10 worth of bitcoin is immediately pulled from your Coinbase bitcoin wallet (based on the current Coinbase spot price).
