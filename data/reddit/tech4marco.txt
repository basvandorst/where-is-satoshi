Are you familiar with  and  and  and  and  and  ?
If you look at these in-ram&amp;/in-memory databases, you will understand that they support replication, hashing, lists, structured client access and everything but what the blockchain is, which is Bitcoin. 
Then you have another generation of in-ram databases such as Kudu:  which has implemented Raft, as the consensus mechanism, but has still nothing to do with what Bitcoin does, despite the many technological similarities. 
What you lack with the so-called private blockchains is PoW and a huge amount of nodes that hosts the database records, perform validation on the transaction, propagate the data and subsequently are allowed to enter and leave the network, which in turn forms a decentralized consensus network, that is a feature, which cannot be replicated into a private environment no matter how hard you wish for it to happen. 
There is no such thing as a private blockchain, or a ledger that needs inventing, they already exist and are mostly based on in-ram/in-memory databases that exactly handles the large amount of data banks require to clear. 
You probably heard of Hadoop, being a good example of a grid structure that some banks make use of.

The final attack against Bitcoin's resilience will come from its fake/real creator. Only then will the decentralized system prove itself beyond any doubt from manipulation. 
If Wright signs, it only proves he was either given the keys, or has access to the keys via other means.

I understand the OR(a,b,c) functionality given by the BIP. But it seems limited in terms of that we still have to rely on the limitations of Script. 
Could we for example be allowed to use XOR operations, while using this BIP exclusively? 
It seems that if the BIP isolates the operation to commit only to true outputs (I assume true based on Script rules in this case), then we could use XOR outside the blockchain storage, or am I wrong? 
@_date: 2016-04-02 17:21:20
But if it keeps portion of the program private, what are minimum requirements? I get that we dont have to shove the entire execution in the blockchain, but surely there must be a minimum requirement that needs to be placed in the blockchain, apart from the root hash. 
But, limitation wise, do we have a good user case for what we can program into this, without showing anything other than the result? 
@_date: 2016-04-02 18:24:24
All crystal clear now! Thank you Adam. 
If what you say in regards to extending the Script language, or adding a new Scripting language is true (see what I did there), then we are in for a treat! 
Couple this with secondary layers and channels, and we have ourselves something truly mind blowing.
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:16:25
Script is the language used in Bitcoin transactions. All transactions are based on the language and therefore all transactions are programmatic in nature, aka. smart contracts. 
What this does is to enable more types of transactions to perform more elaborate functions.

@_date: 2017-03-18 19:46:12
All you say is pretty much spot on correct. 
The industry however suffers from a lot of hype, mainly due to Ethereum'esque projects that make it seem as if coming up with a blockchain that can do X, Y and Z more than Bitcoin, are miraculous. 
Most people have absolutely no clue to why Bitcoin is unique, or how its lack of governance is its actual biggest strenght. 
You (and I for that matter), will be the silent voices in this matter, until Bitcoin reaches its true potential. Until then, its snake oil salesmen and prophets than can sing the song about blockchain the loudest that wins, Vikalik being one of them. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 21:24:29
Sometimes we have to wonder how it even got this far? 
Not only are most BU fanatics most likely sock puppet accounts paid for by Ver, but the incompetence by the handful of developers is definitely not what Bitcoin should ever be reliant on. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:20:26
In this case, the following will apply: 
1) The non BU signalling miners will earn zero, leading to whatever they deem fit, for example a legal case as Bitfury threatened against anyone that changes PoW or orphans their blocks
2) The chain keeps getting build, but no transactions ever confirm and we end up with a huge que 
3) Miners loose the transaction fees completely
4) Price will probably drop, making it impossible for miners to earn from their farms
5) Miners either keeping up the attack and loosing money every day, or shutting off rigs, in which case old miners again gain hash power and start making money
The only question here is time and the dynamics of how long things take and how long before someone goes bust due to low income
In either case, as long as full nodes sit idle then nothing really changes in terms of the network topology
@_date: 2017-03-27 22:02:02
Something is definitely happening that we are not told about. For people to turn this much against to what seems to be a genuine description of how he perceives Bitcoin, something must have happened. 
Either some people in the industry are being targetted by someone to act maliciously, or something else entirely is happening. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 11:35:21
I think pretty much everyone by now, know of the cesspool called BU. We are being bombarded daily about your crap project, and yet, you claim we are not informed? 
Take your crap code, your broken model and your political campaign elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-03-15 11:02:05
BU was only build to confuse, split and cause havoc in the community. For all we know, BU might as well be financed by banks. 
We have seen time over and over again that BU is anything from a Sybil attack, to downplaying that a hard fork is not going to be a problem for Bitcoin. 
BU is a political tool, nothing more. The codebase is a joke and the followers are sockpuppets, it is as plain and simple as that. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:20:12
BU is not a real project, it is a political tool to assume control of Bitcoin and cause panic and havoc. This has worked well to some extend, and has delayed features. 
However when we time by time again prove that not only is the codebase completely junk and an utter disaster, it becomes more and more clear how much of a political tool it is. 
I would not be surprised BU is less than 20 people, paid to full time make it look like there is an actual movement behind it.  
@_date: 2017-03-25 04:05:26
Much more than you will ever be able to comprehend. Ignorance is a bliss, and you will unfortunately never comprehend to the extend required what they are actually building. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 01:58:28
That makes absolutely no sense. An off-chain transaction is by default a payment that is already within a payment channel, which implies that the btc is already comitted as a tx via an input. 
If fallbacks are meant to be on-chain it would imply that due to network errors an off-chain tx would default out of the pre-image tx into a "regular input" which would be a sucky way to handle off-chain tx. 
To my understanding, while anyone can choose to go on-chain at any moment with their transactions, off-chain usually stays within a channel and certainly does not default to an on-chain tx due to "lag" or other "challenges". 
@_date: 2017-03-25 04:03:00
You have got to be kidding! We are here because we have a decentralized permissionless payment protocol, and you are asking why it is wrong to have centralized control. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:19:51
Are you planning to allow payment channels/secondary layers to interface with RSK on its own secondary layer? 
This would be interesting as it would allow us to mix Bitcoins with RSK coins and/or RSK smart contracts. It should allow us to compute structured secondary layer contracts that would instantly verify and produce results. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 20:30:32
This should be stickied! 
UASF is us and only us, the devs cannot be part of this choice. We need to review everything ourselves and agree amongs ourselves. 
Personally, if the patch is bug free, I would run it, and participate in activating SegWit. I want the miners to learn a lesson and be punished for their ignorance towards the users. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 21:02:39
2010, TWENTY TEN! This is in a time where Bitcoin at best is used by 1000 people, if even that many. Its not known to most people prior to 2011. Of course there were bugs, and there were even more bugs prior to this date. 
What is NOT acceptable is that there are bugs in software meant to carry 20 billion dollars. BU is a joke, it is a complete and utter joke and a mockery to software development. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:16:53
You are forgetting block discovery is on avarage 10 minutes. This makes Bitcoin one of the worste payment methods in the world, and creates uncertainty for transactions that needs a fast confirmation time.
Its not just about the fee per transaction, it is about finalizing a payment without the uncertainty of it existing and not having a chargeback. Remove these two barriers and you have a payments system that dwarfs anything else.

It is actually disgusting how the miners are treating what is pretty much one of the best collection of coders on the planet.

Its not coded yet for this client, no. 
But it can be done, as a library for example, and in any language you see fit. What is ready right now is the very crude wires. What can be build on top, however has no limits. 
Building the probalistic payment rules requires someone defines under what conditions sub satoshi payments should be working under. I assume this is IoT related? 
You want something that blows your mind? Check this out:  This means with lightning, we can finally start exploring secure multiparty computations! 
@_date: 2017-03-15 12:52:42
Who cares who found the bug? 
The bug was introduced by incompetent developers of the BU team. This is a bug that should NOT exist, had they followed the core review process. 
There is nothing else to say here than that it is a BU fuck up and that BU has FAILED in delivering code. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 12:23:16
This layer, the secondary layer, we call "the lightning network" pretty much supports and does anything you would want to. 
Reason for this is that you are building code against a localized daemon, which in turn means as if you are running code on your own server. 
There are obviously compatability rules you would need to follow in order to speak with the rest of the network, and you would need to construct your transactions so that they adhere to utilizing the script language in Bitcoin. 
But apart from that, you are free to store the channel data in any type of database you would like, NoSQL/MySQL. 
You are free to set your own fee, your own gui, your own way of handling pretty much anything. 
What you get is insanely fast, verifiable, non reversible, payments that can scale to larger than Visa/MC since anyone with a server/computer can become a hub. 
You are no longer just your own bank, you are also your own payment processor and payment clearer. Or you can be your own lender and offer good rates to those that wish to keep their channels alive. 
The options are pretty much endless and this is prior to the begining ! 
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:20:58
You come from an angle of having used Bitcoin on-chain, via the blockchain. Most people in this world have not used Bitcoin, and probably wont care about the things we care. They just want to pay, and not understand how and why. 
Maybe you dont believe this, but we can be pretty certain they wont do any opening or closing on anything themselves. My surgeon should not even know of this mechanism, nor should he make time to learn it. He needs to press a button that says; pay, and nothing else. The rest of the time he needs to get better at his job. 
Our job is to give everyone the means for clearing payments, fast, efficient, cheap and easy. These capabilities will just never exist on-chain regardless of how big the block size is.

How about someone taking their time to educating Jihan in how Lightning will work, and why it will scale Bitcoin to allow miners to make more money than they already do? 
At some point, miners have to survive based on fee's only, or predominantly at least. 
If Lightning hubs are the main payers of these fee's, maybe he should look into what a world with Bitcoin as financial backbone looks like, and stop thinking small. 
We are talking 7+ billion people here, nothing less. With that, there will be plenty of on-chain settlements to make any miner more than happy. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 12:18:52
If they "attack" it by mining empty blocks, then the chain will still continue to be build, regardless of transactions getting included or not. 
Miners that do not "attack" the chain will pick up the transactions and include them in the blocks they find. Worste case scenario is that we have transactions that take long time to get included in a block. 
Guess what? We already experienced this for the past 6 months when everyone was screaming it took hours to get included. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 12:51:10
AMAZING! I have a few questions. 
Why did you have to generate 3 blocks, and then 3 more blocks in order for the Node B and C to discover each other? 
Since they had established a channel together, after the first 3 blocks were generated, and the payment was confirmed, how come you needed to wait for 3 more blocks before the discovery state triggered? 
How is the fee set? Is it currently hardcoded or can nodes set this via the command line? 
Why cant node A and node C connect to each other, once they request and send payments back and forth? Why do they have to keep going through node B and paying a fee? What prevents them from discovering each other after having established a financial relationship? 
Could nodes add each other manually? Thus forming more direct relationships and true decentralization without ending up with mega hubs as central points.
@_date: 2017-03-27 21:29:15
I dont think we can depend on mainstream or should even try to get mainstream to adopt what we know. We are largely living in a small bubble here, and only a fraction of interested tech people can understand what this is all about anyway. 
The whole point of Bitcoin is that the people deeply involved in it, with their core nodes/economic full nodes, are capable of resisting an attack by the miners. Then and only then is Bitcoin ready to go mainstream. If we cant figure this one out, forget about the protocol layer ever supporting the masses. 
This is from my point of view, basically where it is all going to be decided. If we are to get secondary layers, that would allow for mass adoption via second and third layers (web wallets integrated into lightning for example), then the primary layer and its core users damn well better be getting their shit right. 
General users wont stand for: "oh noo, we forked, all your money is gone, from the job you held the last 30 years, sorry. It was a guy called Jihan and another dude called Roger that made us hardfork. "
People in Bitcoin, involved in this debate, running the nodes, better get their shit in order, better get their head around what is happening, and better make the right choice, or this thing, we have all spend way too long time on, could be for nothing.

First of all, you are wrong. It does not matter how much people that add code to the Core repo agree's with each other, if none of the nodes want to run the code. 
Secondly, in order to participate, you actually do need to be able to write code. It may frustrate you that you cannot directly participate in writing the code and adding the features you see fit, but you also do not participate in Linux kernel development for the same reasons.

@_date: 2016-12-06 18:28:44
They have no valid case and product, but they certainly have arguments, which is what is keeping us landlocked. 
At this point, I find it difficult to see how we can get a fix for malleability, as they seem to be hellbend to stop segwit from activating. And its working, the activation is slower than OP_CLTV and OP_CSV. 
If they keep us in stagnation mode, they get what they want. They dont need a product nor a valid case at this point. They have the loudest voice and its making its impact. 
Call me a sceptic, and prove me wrong, I would like that very much.

Why this double speak about how the "underlying technology of Bitcoin" is something that can be used by banks? 
There is NO underlying technology in Bitcoin. Everything Bitcoin is, is because of all the pieces. Pull one out, and you end up with a database. 
Banks already use Hadoop, and what R3 is building is yet another Hadoop derivative. 
Also, banks are not using SWIFT to to settle trades, they use SWIFT as the central messaging system. Settlements happen on RTGS and via the central banks.

It depends, as running a node is not a constant fixed consumption. 
It depends on how many peers connect to me, and how many of those peers are up to date with the blockchain. 
If more than 5-6 of the peers are several weeks behind, I end up serving them part of the missing GB of data they lack. This can quickly run up in 6-8GB every 24h. 
While I am home in the evening this is a big problem, as I cant even browse websites like the BBC, which is partially cached in my browser. 
I usually shut down the node while doing so, and restart it to run again in the night. 
Point being, is that if running 1MB nodes is this heavy, then running 4MB nodes is definitely out of the question. And I dont even have the option to upgrade my network to 4x the speed. At 4MB, my node dies, period.

Burnouts? Do you even understand what the core developers are capable of? These are not your regular hire, or regular programmers. These dudes are hardcore low level cryptographers.

These guys are at the current moment irreplaceable in terms of skill, experience and on top of it all, having to listen to personal attacks day in and out from people that cannot comprehend their choices. 
I am sorry, but you have clearly no understanding of the skills required to participate in this particular project. It is on par with kernel developers or other low level projects, but with the twist of that errors cannot appear in their code.

While it may be hilarious at the moment, the tone can change quickly if all that anger is suddenly used to actually harm a core dev. Would you still come here and say rbtc is just a normal sub with a different oppinion?

There are different levels of "ready" for lightning. 
At the moment with the very limited amount of people using Bitcoin, we can easily spend a year or two making Lightning better while we onboard people to using it. 
Was Bitcoin ready by the time Satoshi left the project? 
Hardly! It took another 5 years to get to where we are today, with thousands of modifications. Did that stop us using it and submit issues to the repository? 
Did it stop us using it, or stop us improve it? 
Ready is a very fluent subject, and I dont think anyone in tech has the concept of READY before technology can be tried, as the goalpost continuously move in our world. 
The question you need to ask is: Is lightning ready to be used by very savvy people that this industry is predominantly made out of? I believe it is.

I have been running a node the past 4 years, more or less 24/7. 
Guess what! The last 12 months have been extremely heavy to run the node, with the last 6 almost impossible for my home network. What you big blockers seem to constantly forget is that nodes not only download the blockchain, but also upload. 
I have many times had to simply cut the connection of the computer that hosts my node, because it makes the internet unusable. 
This is with 1MB, and it happens at least once every day. 
Now you have met a person, that not only downloads the blockchain, but also propagates blocks to other peers in the network, and that tells you, its very very heavy to run this node. At peak times, it can upload up to 6GB per day. When it runs at these peaks, I usually shut it down. 
Also FYI, I live in central London, and have a normal connection for 30£ per month from 3. This translates to that running a full node, is almost out of reach for any regular standard out of the box home network in one of the best connected cities in the world.  
If we get Segwit I am not even sure I can run it at home any longer. If we loose home hosted nodes, Bitcoin becomes a server only solution, and would no longer be safe to use.

This is not how a hardfork works. If for whatever reason the BU crowd forks themselves out of the network, the nodes do not automatically follow.

Actually what really matters is how many people think like he does. Despite all its volatility, if enough people trust Bitcoin this much it will keep going up.

You are mixing two different issues. 
Nodes have to be ABLE to be run by people with limited resources as it creates decentralization by design.
If the protocol layer does not stay decentralized and light to run, we end up with a paypalesque system that can only be run by data centers. 
Why do you want nodes to become heavy to run? What is the point of this, if we already have data center money via banks? Why spend all this time to just end up with what we already have?

Bitcoin in this particular case is very superior. They dont even need to transport anything on them, if they store Bitcoin at an online wallet. They need to remember an email and password.

So the specs for Transactions and Scripts is vaporware? 
And the specs for peer protocol for channel management is also vaporware? 
How about the code from LND:  is this vaporware as well? 
Or how about the fact that Acinq together with Bitfury tested lightning?  This is vaporware as well? 
How about the test between one of the founders of blockchain.info and his Lightning developer, on the Thunder network:  Was this also vaporware? 
Could it possibly just be that Lightning is not yet used on main net because we dont have malleability fixed, and can thus not create secure transactions via payment channels?

Yes, this industry has attracted enough lunatics as it is, and the last thing we need despite our differences is that one wrong lunatic that takes the anger too personal and does something about it in real life.  
Personally I think the line between critique and and hate is as following. 
Critique towards the code, and the effect of said code. Nothing beyond this, and nothing about whom build said code. 
No name calling, no witch hunting, no personal attacks, no doxing. 
From what I see rbtc is much less composed in terms of the above. There is way too much attack towards personalities, rather than the code. At times it becomes disgusting. 
If you are a mod in there, do the entire industry a favor and make the choice of removing hatred. In the long run this will have a positive effect, regardless of what we end up with technologically.

Spot on article that explains the current situation. 
Sadly for those that believe in Bitcoin and its future being powered by Segwit, is probably not going to happen. 
The weakest link in Bitcoin was also what made it work, PoW. The miners are under the influence of the brigade that would like to see Bitcoin disappear, and we can probably safely say no new features will be merged as long as /btc exists.

On the other hand, my USB, paper wallet or brain wallet they would not even notice nor understand what is. Thus, in a situation like this, Bitcoin seems like a pretty damn solid option.

You assume what he did was not by design but as a temporary fix. It is doubtful that the limit was implemented to later be hard-forked and cause potential networks splits. 
It is more realistic to believe that it was set to a fixed size, and that the work around the limit was left to be solved via payment channels as that particular technology was still immature.
See Sphinx and Bolt that Rusty and Tadge are working with right now for examples of technology suited for payment channels.

This is why running a full node gives you maximum protection. Without running full nodes, you would trust miners soft forking anything into the ruleset of the Bitcoin consensus network. 
@_date: 2019-02-13 18:49:28
Transaction ordering is not the same as consensus rules. 
A full node implements and enforces the rules of the network. If a miner decides to give himself a bonus fee after solving a block as a consensus rule change, the block will be ignored by full nodes (invalidated). 
On the other hand, regardless of if a miner ignores transactions, or only includes transactions with a certain fee, the full nodes will not block those given blocks, due to that no consensus rules have been breached. 
It is up to the miners to decide which transactions are included in the blocks. But their blocks would be invalidated by full nodes if those blocks do not follow the same rules.

This might help some people: 
@_date: 2019-02-13 20:36:45
This is not how it works at all. You keep confusing consensus rules, soft forks and what not in a big pot. 
If miner B and C agree's to a new rule, in where a soft-fork enforces a minimum miners fee per block, it is therefore a consensus rule change. It doesnt matter what chain has the most accumulated PoW in this instance. 
This means miner B  and C immediately hard-forks off the current network as none of the full nodes would accept a different set of rules.
Hashrate, regardless of what miners agree to implement, does not force the full nodes to follow a different chain, if the ruleset are consensus changes, period.

I dont think we need to be so dark about the closing/opening of channels yet. There is a very very long way before we hit 7 billion people using Bitcoin and we are at the very begining of this technology being developed. 
I also dont see people, normal people using LN the way you and I will maybe be using LN. The closing and opening of channels, as well as the channel balances will be handled by wallet providers. Mom and pop will as usual click "send money" and not think about the technological layer. 
It will be business decissions to fund channels based on statistics, and large entities, bank like companies, will have millions invested in the LN channels to facilitate their customer base.

After yet another incident, I find it hard to accept anyone not paid or malicious towards Bitcoin can keep advocating for this implementation. 
@_date: 2017-04-28 12:27:59
So you are saying that a bank holding billions, in 2017 has an issue when it is payday to update the records in realtime and needs hours of backlog? 
I dont buy it, I dont buy it at all. This can be solved by scaling the platform, and they had years to do it. 
For all we know it can be anything from queueing to dead servers to sync errors between servers to complete loss of records on primary servers.

You guys have always been at the forefront of the development within the Bitcoin industry, and I personally love to see stuff coming from you. 
For example, it would be very cool if you guys (if time allows) could elaborate more on simplicity, MAST and the various other opcodes you have enabled in your sidechain that is still live? 
It would especially be cool if you could  elaborate more on certain topics and maybe give the rest of the industry that is not as low level capable as you are, a bit more toys to play with or some deeper information.

If something is not immutable, it therefore means it is mutable. There is nothing in between. If Eth is muteable, then it is no different from centralized bank databases. 
How muteable ETH is, and how difficult it might be to change records, does not matter, as changing the records in a bank ledger is also not easy, but can still be influenced to be changed, by those whom are granted the power to do so, either politically or by other means.

And subsequently broken Bitcoin by allowing large TX's to destroy most nodes. And obviously running a full node would be impossible from a home network.

Just bought for 1000€ on their site. Works pretty good and I got the coins in less than 10 minutes. They seem to be adding more and more payment options. Worth to notice its the only place to offer Ecopayz as payment.

I agree with this statement 100%. 
Pretty much the single most important thing that is needed in Bitcoin right now is to open up for mass consumption. For something to happen a realistic alternative has to exist. 
The LN guys are almost done, its going to be a fantastic 2018 with LN deploying left right and centre.

Ethereum is, if this is the path the software is taking, as good as useless from a decentralized, permissionless point point of view. There is no balance, its either immutable or not at all. 
It matters not what the TPS is, it matters not what type of smart contracts are executed, or how great their code becomes. It will be nothing but a glorified database.
@_date: 2018-07-15 16:59:55
He is 100% correct though. Why hide the truth? 
@_date: 2018-07-01 18:13:49
I think he is refering to the, kicking the can down the road, problem, rather than an actual limit of x MB. 
Its not really about 1, or 2 or some other arbitrary number, its about the fact that it doesnt scale to the needs of a worldwide payment system/currency on-chain. It eventually becomes centralized/server-farm hosting only.

If I could give you 100 upvotes I would!

Amazing work, by some of the very best developers! Lucky to have these people working on next gen technology for our industry.

As I said, I ran it since last reboot, which is roughly 775 blocks, as each block is 1MB on avarage, thus 775MB. In the same time period I uploaded 60000MB. 
It is useful to run your own node if you do indeed receive transactions. This is obviously more important for merchants, rather than normal users that might only do a few tx per month. 
Miners do NOT verify transactions, they order the transactions in the blockchain, and/or build the chain of blocks. They neither verify implicitly, because they are miners, nor do they uphold the rules because they create blocks. 
All verification of the consensus rules are up to consensus nodes, aka full nodes, to enforce, upon receiving, validating and propagating blocks.

This is probably one of his top5. Saved!

The 2X was not "just" an upgrade, it was another masquaraded attempt by yourself, your puppeteer and your cronies to take Bitcoin and make it centralized. 
You failed, the community got it what it wanted and you still have no control. If you did, Bitcoin would be worthless to most people here. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 17:49:45
Time to prepare for Grin! Will make all these attempts obsolete. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:02:46
I dont think you can fully appreciate what it means to run a full node, or propagate blocks to other nodes in the network, without running one yourself. 
At this very moment, looking at my stats since I last rebooted my Bitcoin-qt, which is running as a full node, I have downloaded 775MB of data. 
In the same time period, I have uploaded 60GB of data. There is almost a 100x discrepancy between downloading blocks and uploading blocks. 
Keep in mind that this 60GB of upload is on default settings, without blocking or unblocking or actively doing anything. This is just my full node participating in the network, by being logged on, and doing what it is doing. 
This amount of data uploaded is at 1MB blocks, and this is on a relatively strong laptop, with a fibre connection in one of the best connected cities in the world. 
I doubt I could keep up with more than 4MB, let alone 32MB blocks. You really need to run a full node yourself, and understand how heavy it is to run  it, to fully appreciate why some of us are reluctant to doing anything to the blocksize.

Who is everyone? The ones with 1+ million dollar that were specially invited to sit at the table? 
What about the 55.000+ everyone full nodes? Did they agree to this? 
What about any of the developers that so far has build the Bitcoin we all use today, were any of them there? 
What about the rest of the industry? Should they bow to the will of few companies deciding what Bitcoin is?  
Who is to say that the table you all sat at, wont be with with banks next time? 
This is the begining of the end of Bitcoin if special few selected can change everything they see fit. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:43:43
I am with Matt on this one. These companies circumvented everything and are putting themselves in charge of the entire Bitcoin ecosystem. 
How is this any different than having banks in charge of the financial system? 
This deal is a hostile takeover, masqueraded as a compromise to the "stalling" issue, that to begin with is manufactured by Antminer.
Paypal 2.0 with few companies calling the shots is all there is to this deal.   
EDIT: Where is the BIP? Where is the peer review on the code? Actually, where is the code all together? 
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:26:05
Where is the code?
You seem to already be prepared to jump and asking how high without knowing what you jump into. 
How can you even start arguing for something that does not even exist outside of a closed room? Has it really come to this? You expect us to just run whatever software we are told by few invite only companies? How is this any different from a closed board room meeting at HSCB or JP Morgan? 
@_date: 2017-05-23 21:03:38
Bitcoin is not compromise. 
Now we at least know, that in the future, when some large country feels threatened by Bitcoin, you will be the first to "compromise". 
@_date: 2017-05-23 21:20:04
Bitcoin works fine as it is. There is no NEED to compromise with hostility. 
If you cant see compromise is leading to control you have misunderstood what Bitcoin is about. 
You are not supposed to ask for permission to run what software you want to run or give up the software you currently run. 
If the counterparty doesnt like this fact, it is their problem, not yours. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 21:40:28
So you are saying that fear is what triggers you? A "what if" is what compelled you to run different software? 
You dont seem to understand what power you (we running current Bitcoin) are holding. We dont *need* to do anything. Bitcoin works, and it works perfectly. 
If someone is mad about how it works, they can fork onto their own chain. But coming here and saying that we all need to change because they are mad, is a compromise down the road to complete loss of control.

Pretty clear he was on to what was later described as bi-directional payment channels. Replacing a tx within a nLockTime is exactly what payment channels are at a ground level. Incredibe foresight none the less.

How is synchronization achieved due to CLTV? Does it actually matter apart from synchronization that the clocks start? Hope you can elaborate a bit more on the CLTV description.
