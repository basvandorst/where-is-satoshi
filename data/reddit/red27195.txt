Of course you own the BTC you've bought - if in this hypothetical situation for example - Coinbase would merely hold the BTC for you, they don't own it at all. Kinda like the same way a Bank holds your money - they don't own it, they have a stake in in so to speak. But the thing is, crypto isn't centralised so it's owned by no-one and everyone at the same time. Understand?
What I'm saying is that it's ludicrous to think that you have any control over it. You can influence it sure, but you can't control it.

Where the fuck did I write anything like that? I said 'There is no way you can prove its authenticity' because it relies on other people to authenticate it, which can then be forged or tampered with. Retard.


It is a currency that exists on a screen, but it is still currency. It's just as real as the numbers you see on your screen when you log into your bank account.


You do. You still own the money. You can do with the money what you wish. I could transfer my BTC from Blockchain wallet to BTC Core any time I wanted. That means I own it - I'm just letting Blockchain hold it for me, which I trust with their vast server security, wallet encryption, etc. It's not like I'm denied the right to get my private key, is it. You're just paranoid about the gubmint and hax0rz getting your coin.
Therefore, it honestly **doesn't** matter if you have private keys in regard to **controlling** money, but it **does** matter in regard to money **security.**
We on the same page now?

Using your logic, everyone who has fiat money in the bank doesn't own their own money, or that you possess an 'IOU' to the bank just for storing money in it, which is fucking retarded. If anything, you get more money BACK from the banks as they pay interest on it - just like holding BTC. The similar real-world applicability of your logic would be taking out your life savings from your bank and holding it all in a big chest under your bed. Or, in other words, fucking retarded.
No-one can outright own part of currency that isn't backed by anything, because the money can't exist unto itself. It exists as part of a monolithic continuance of a large whole of commerce - the market exists as a large organism, only propped up by others continually buying and selling to keep it alive. 
You're talking about your keys as if you have your own bank, which is absurd. Even if you owned your own bank it would have to enact upon others in order to stay in business - you can't buy and sell from yourself now can you.
It's an illusion of security, an illusion of control. You can't control btc any more than you can control the weather.

You're a fucking miracle mate. You literally read what I write and completely miss what I'm trying to say and can only call me a troll because of your pea-sized brain. Good trolling.

It honestly doesn't matter whether or not you control your own keys. Stop this meme. Just a bunch of nerds trying to create a sense of 'we know more than you' when in real life it doesn't impact anything.

And yet those keys haven't saved your bitcoins from losing their original value, which was my point all along. I honestly don't see why you're getting so paranoid.
If anything, the third parties holding my BTC in limbo is a good thing: I can't sell them (why would I want to anyway)... It merely 'limbos' it until the market stabilises - if anything it offers more protection.

A currency is nothing without the market. Without a bank, coins are just worthless pieces of circular metal. What I'm saying is that without the market, BTC is just numbers on a screen. There is no way you can prove its authenticity, therefore you can't control it.
However those numbers on a screen are safe to a certain extent - others have approved transaction on the blockchain etc. Therefore, the currency is backed by people, not resource. Instead of gold backing it up, its backed up by John Smith's word. Get it? You still own BTC, its just VOLATILE.
I have BTC invested so I'm not trying to dissuade you from keeping it either. If you have the private keys it adds security. That's it. You could have £100,000 of BTC on a usb drive, but if the market fails, you're fucked. It doesn't matter. The fact that you have your private keys makes no difference at all because the value has deteriorated to such an extent that they are - simply - numbers on a screen.
This is basic economics kid.

Just because you don't understand me, don't assume I'm stupid.
You still own BTC without the fucking keys. Instead of it yourself, you are lending it to another entity for safekeeping. I personally online wallet Blockchain for safekeeping as it's online based. If I kept my BTC on hardware, I could easily lose it or it could corrupt.
Hardware wallets are to microsoft word as online wallets are to Google Drive. You still own your document, but Google keeps it safe for you. If Google's servers are compromised or hacked, you could lose your documents - same as with Blockchain. I'm saying I prefer Google Drive.
Now do you understand or do I have to draw you a picture?

Oh shut up. You've 'saved my username'... Get fucked.

Who the fuck puts their live savings into something as volatile and unregulated as fucking Bitcoin? Is that what you're doing? If so, bravo you utter dipshit, if you lose everything you deserve it.
Also, they're called **wallets** for a reason. You should never put more than what you'd put into your **physical** wallet, so nothing more than £100 and even that's pushing it.

You're a fucking moron. You don't have control of your coins, the market does. The market controls itself. Everyone who owns BTC therefore owns a share in it - it's like a business. If the business crashes, so to does the value of BTC. Doesn't matter if you have a paper wallet or some other paranoid overpriced bullshit, the market will always own it. Bitcoin core can be hacked. Offline wallets can have viruses. It's very unsafe- therefore a gamble.
Oh but sorry, you are an ascended being with your £1000 trezor, my mistake o holy apostle.
@_date: 2017-07-23 23:31:30
Debate me. It doesn't matter at all - just people thinking they have a modicum of control in a very volatile gamble. You have no control over the market, over the economy, nothing. Even if you managed to waste thousands for trezor, you are still a bag in the wind.

This is bait, a funny one at that.
Mining is not a profitable venture. Just buy bitcoin, transfer to ethereum, and hold. Sell when the market gets more profitable.
