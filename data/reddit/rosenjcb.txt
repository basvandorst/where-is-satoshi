I mean a fee is whatever, I just want to buy my bitcoin on the go.
Got everything verified but they want me to wait 3-5 days to verify my documents. Managed to scan my IDs and take that damn webcam picture. We'll see how quick they are.
I still have my coinbase account open, but I haven't bothered with them after their escapades. 
@_date: 2016-08-31 04:41:06
I have a scanner actually now that I think of it.
@_date: 2016-08-31 04:47:11
Lol Jesus Christ, just tried to login again. Now it's trying to text my dead device (RIP Nexus 6 ;_;) and it demands a government ID. Goddamn it, okay. You win.
EDIT: Lol, no. It's using my backup phone for the texts. We're gucci!
@_date: 2016-08-31 04:35:41


Well now they want me to give them government ID. Camera broke so I guess I'm kind of fucked?
@_date: 2014-08-05 19:30:37
Why didn't your team just claim a possibility of error due to extrapolation or something? Seems like that could have saved your jobs and positions.

I see that changetip has a wallet linked to your account. Can I use this as a wallet for daily transactions or is this limited to the tip and be tipped system that they have going?
@_date: 2014-08-06 19:59:20
And darn, my phone can't use the blockchain wallet. :( Any alternatives with a blackchain wallet address?
@_date: 2014-08-06 21:57:45
I set up a blockchain wallet and a mycelium wallet for my phone. If I need more security, I'll look into Trezor and cold strage in general. Thanks!

The sin of over-aggregation.
@_date: 2014-08-06 19:23:25
Before I end up transferring the tips (thanks guys) over to a wallet. I need some recommendations. I'm thinking about using blockchain, but I'd ideally like an option where I could log in with a social account (like google). For the record, I also have two Android devices (an Android phone and Kindle). Any good recommendations for secure and easily accessible accounts would be strongly recommended.
Again, thanks for all the tippers and everyone that participated in this thread. The r/bitcoin community is fantastic.

In my day, the ultimate hackers were called, "the Bitcoms." They terrorized the interwebs and economy by making the prices of websites like the Yahooz and America on AOL skyrocket. I even had one friend who worked at Goggles who said that the Bitcoms hacked and raided his internets, and he had to spend $50 million dollars to get them out. Ever since then, we call this economic catastrophe, "the Bitcom bubble." Darn those hackers, darn them all to heck.
@_date: 2014-08-06 21:19:36
I know plenty of people with a bachelors in economics whom have honestly forgotten more than I know. And, quite honestly, I'm only like 2 courses away from completing my economics requirements and the rest is gen ed and business. Though, I must admit, that the finance courses I have to take for business are really helpful towards my understanding of economics (though, I could have gotten an econ degree through the social science school as well and avoided all the business requirements).  Though, yes, I do not have a bachelors in economics (yet) nor have I started my PhD (yet).
@_date: 2014-08-06 16:59:27
Can't really test a currency. The experiment cannot be contained and the variables are uncontrollable. It's part of the problem with empiricism in social sciences.

Well the basic workings of bitcoin (which the whitepaper provides), how it's different from fiat currencies and limited resources like gold and silver, the implications it has within finance, an application of modern portfolio theory on bitcoin, et cetera.
@_date: 2014-08-06 14:27:00


Meh, changes in money supply seem more like a symptom than the actual problem with business cycles. And, I don't think Friedman's money growth rule would stop large expansions and retractions of bitcoin. I'm biased though, my professor calls Friedman a communist (tongue in cheek, but Friedman's not libertarian enough for him).
@_date: 2014-08-06 19:15:28


I guess that's the best option. Normally, I would want a service that connects to my gmail, but I can't exactly rely on Google to keep my bitcoin safe if any law gets passed.

Are they now? A link? Also, thanks. 
@_date: 2014-08-07 13:27:52
We're stuck in ideology instead of rigorous thought, which is a problem. It's the nature of the discipline in today's world as we believe that economists can engineer society. It's unavoidable, and other disciplines suffer from this cognitive dissonance as well (nutrition, for example). I'm not a salesman though. I just want to do meaningful research and help discover how this wacky world works given the setting.

Damn, you caught me. I will convert the Raspberry Pi masses one day! (Who's Slush?)
@_date: 2014-08-07 13:02:59
@_date: 2014-08-06 14:43:51
No, and I don't actually like the Raspberry Pi that much. Not because I hate embedded systems, but because the Raspberry Pi uses crap parts. If I wanted an embedded board, I'd buy a TI board or some kind of beagleboard. 
@_date: 2014-08-06 19:11:30
One reason may be that M3 was increasingly rapidly past M2 (and I have a strong suspicion that the housing bubble had something to do with that). They don't like big percentage increases with the money supply because it freaks people out. But, if you can say to investors that price inflation is kept to a low (they like Friedman's number of 2-3%), then everyone is happy. I don't know, this could just be conspiracy shit; but, I honestly don't believe how it could be that much more difficult for them to record M3, which is primarily made up of larger assets. I'm terribly naive about finance though, so I could easily be wrong.
@_date: 2014-08-06 19:50:41
Gotcha'. Keeping it simple then.
@_date: 2014-08-13 13:08:58
Econometrics and statistics are basically synonyms, so yes. Here's a reading list I have for statistics/econometrics in finance:
For the basic finance:
The Universal Principles of Successful Trading by Brent Penfold
Expected Returns by Ilmanen (for longer returns, e.g. futures)
Quantitative Equity Portfolio Management (for maximizing gains and minimizing risk in portfolio theory)
For statistics/econometrics:
All of Statistics by Wasserman (read this if you won't read any other statistics book, it's really good)
As you suggested, Introductory Econometrics by Woolridge.
Econometric Theory and Methods by Davidson and MacKinnon
Robust Statistics by Maronna, Martin, and Yohai (these are all good, but the first two you should read for statistics are All of Statistics and Introductory Econometrics).
@_date: 2014-08-06 18:55:42
I'm minoring in computational science, so I like this as well.
@_date: 2014-08-06 19:31:34
Undergraduate, but the work that I do does involve knowing economic literature and applying it; so, I consider myself an economist. Hell, "Economics in One Lesson," was written by a man without a college education.
@_date: 2014-08-07 12:47:23
I have many interests. I'm minoring in computational science as well, but I've always loved programming in general. Though, in particular, I love graphics programming. Like, the problems surrounding it are so cool and you get sick looking graphics when you make a break through.
@_date: 2014-08-07 12:42:37
I have private keys written on a sticky note. :D
@_date: 2014-08-06 15:30:19

This is one of the reasons why I want to do cross disciplinary work. I love programming and I love comp sci problems almost as much as I love economics. I feel like the advances that can be made with cross work between the fields could be beautiful.
@_date: 2014-08-06 18:49:01
I'm not sure what your definition of economist is, but I consider myself an economist. I have a decent (for an undergraduate) review of economics in a variety of areas. And, by trade, I will tell you why the world operates as it does economically and explain to you that government cannot do anything about it. :D
@_date: 2014-08-07 12:52:25
I'm just saying that, often enough, being an economist doesn't mean having a degree; instead, it means having a strong understanding of the discipline, its methodology, literature, et cetera. Though yes, I think I should make this quite clear, I am still continuing my bachelors and my PhD education will probably start around 2016-ish.
@_date: 2014-08-05 21:19:21
I'm generally curious as to why this can't be the case. With extrapolation, there are a huge number of issues and many studies have been found to be meaningless because they extrapolated too far. Why is it not possible to say, "This is what we studied, this is what we found, but this study could easily be wrong due to immeasurable variables and uncertainty"?
@_date: 2014-08-06 15:58:08


We tend to think it does. It's part of being in a discipline with heavy physics envy. Universities started calling political economy, "economics," so that it would sound more sciency, blah blah.
@_date: 2014-08-06 19:32:42
What's the difference? Does the Mycelium app require a Mycelium wallet (or can any wallet address be linked)? What are the pros and cons, et cetera? I guess I can just google this.
@_date: 2014-08-06 15:56:33
Keep in mind, tongue in cheek. His critique of Friedman is that he got the noble prize and other academic awards for all the "wrong stuff" he wrote.
@_date: 2014-08-06 14:11:13
Logically, this seems very easy to digest. There's a practically hard limit on the creation of bitcoin (it'll take a million years for my raspberry pi to make one bitcoin) and people lose wallets all the time. However, there must be more to it. I mean, this effectively breaks up currency monopolies (with exception to international markets, as multiple currencies are already being used in transactions), so many of the assumptions made by economists concerning money are flawed and outdated. Hayek was one of the few big economists that actually spoke about a choice in currency as the Keynesians, Chicago types, Supply siders, Neoliberals, et cetera always assumed that there was "the supply of money," in their models and writings. Now that money is not nearly as homogeneous as they once assumed, and that there are new markets for money, doesn't that mean that a lot of their research is definitively limited?
@_date: 2014-08-07 13:04:10
I hate me too, but I'm proud of what I do and how far I've gotten. Though, I really try to show more humility.
@_date: 2014-08-07 15:24:30
My thoughts exactly. I have chicken scratch writing. I wish there was some kind of wrapper that could handle my wallets, but each service offers its own wallet and service. Kind of wish there were services that were non-dependent on having a wallet with their website.
@_date: 2014-08-07 13:02:01
S&amp;M? Sorry, I've only really begun diving heavily into game theory (last time I really studied it in class was when I was doing alpha-beta pruning). If you're talking about strategic domination or something, it's not contained to just those scenarios.
@_date: 2014-08-12 13:26:01
I wouldn't play around with stocks, the returns just aren't that good. Honestly, I prefer futures. If you're interested in finance and computational analysis, then study modern portfolio theory. A few good books that you might be interested in are: 
The Universal Principles of Successful Trading (for the basics)
Expected Returns (to understand how longer-term returns work)
Quantitative Equity Portfolio Management (for maximizing gains and minimizing risk)
That's just the basics though. If you're a programmer and you're good with math, then you're going to want to learn how to do econometric/statistical analysis with your portfolio. I recommend:
All of Statistics (you can find this one for free with a google search, FANTASTIC stats book. It rips away a lot of the outdated crap)
Introductory Econometrics (it gives a great review of the math and a lot will make sense if you have a strong understanding of statistics)
Econometric Theory and Methods (more econ stuff)
If you can only read one of these books, read the first one.

Information economics is a real thing, though my phraseology of "IP economics" may have a semantic issue. To be honest, most of it is just historical/legal analysis, but there are quite a few big essays on the subject. See the Demsetz-Arrow exchange.

He tells the best jokes in class. Here's one:
A Jewish couple are having sex problems, the wife just can't find any satisfaction. So they go to a doctor and describe their problem. The doctor says, "Get a strapping young lad to wave a towel over you both as you are copulating." The night after, they do just that; but, the wife is still unsatisfied from the sex. They go to the doctor the very next day and he says, "Well, try switching places with the young lad and your husband." The following night, the husband waves the towel and the young lad has the sex. The night is fantastic and the woman experiences an orgasm for the first time and the husband says, "That's how you wave a towel."

Dude, it's not your fault. I fucked up too. I presumed Blockchain would use the median fee but it didn't. Now I have a guy telling me I'll be waiting a "very very long time". Enjoy waiting another 2 days for the mempool to clear.
OP, just curious, how many satoshis/byte are we talking? I have 65 and I've waited 5 hours now. 
EDIT: The blockchain gods have taken pity on me and confirmed my transaction at 1:30AM (about 5 hours).
@_date: 2017-01-25 04:33:10
Thanks man. I don't mind paying 110 Satoshis/Byte, but I guess blockchain just isn't that smart. That, or I'm a dipshit. I'm not too sure whose fault it is, but I just want to make my order before so it can be shipped tomorrow.

@_date: 2016-12-22 21:56:36
Try Coinbase or Uphold. Coinbase currently has an issue with foreign transactions though, so you might have to call your bank and whitelist their transaction server if you want to do debit transactions. Bank wires work fine with them though.
Uphold is trying(?) to replace Circle. Haven't had much luck with them on the debit card end, not sure if it's the same issue as with Coinbase. I'm waiting on their support.

Like the exchanges knowing the """real""" volume of bitcoin being bought and sold while you can only roughly guess. That puts them at an advantage to overcharge or underpay for bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-22 20:25:13
They say 7 days, but ACH deposits are often shorter than that.
Does that mean they might clear it sooner? My bank tends to be quick with wires and direct deposits. I don't know, they might just make it a standard 7 days to prevent chargebacks.

You can't buy bitcoin from the US on Blockchain.info as far as I can tell. Mycelium is P2P and requires you to physically(???) meet up with someone. Arbitz just uses Glidera, which only accepts bank wires as well I believe.

Not going to bash you over the head about it. Shit happens and most of these guys are Ukrainian fucks. I wouldn't trust Paxful.
I don't know why people will trust sketchy shit like this over Coinbase and Uphold. Like both of those companies are arguably bad, but getting overcharged for bitcoin by like 3% is so infinitely less worse than just getting straight up stolen from.

You have weapons grade autism if you believe that's a realistic option for many individuals. Sorry dude, not moving to your Soviet block and giving up all the luxuries of being an American just so I can buy buttcoin.

Dude, you think I care how long you're a redditor or how long I was a redditor? Literally don't care. Not crying, it's just a bit of a letdown.

I'm not particularly fucked. But when it was at $900, I had enough bitcoin to buy double the product than I am now. As of now, I am short ~$3 and can only get what I originally planned. 
Still waiting on the ACH deposit to go through. Let's pray to Buddha that it goes back up to $900 by Tuesday.

I'm a US citizen, so I don't think blockchain.info has a system for me yet. That's why I was using Circle in the first place.

We'll see what Coinbase decides to do. 
@_date: 2016-12-26 03:08:57
I blame some of the users here as well. They hate Coinbase so much that they'll spam localbitcoin. Yeah dude, I'm going to deposit money into a random dude's bank account because he has a high score and the money is in escrow.
You're trading one sketchy thing for another. But yeah, hope you do better in the future.

I buy my product 2x cheaper than what it is with BTC and I get it straight in the mail.
It's literally the best life when I don't have to do ACH deposits. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 23:45:58
Just so you know, we're suffering together. It's a fucking struggle.

I need to buy my medicine. I like the idea of double medicine, but not of no medicine.
@_date: 2016-12-22 08:56:42
I'll tell you right now it's the worse time to do an ACH purchase. Goddamn it, why now?

You gotta' get be down to Earth and in the fucking ground. Like Kevin Gates.

I miss my DC days when I was working off 16th and K and smoking doobies right outside the White House. Ahh, the good old days.
Shoot an email over towards support+reddit Beforehand I wouldn't have recommended this, but it seems automated now and I actually received a reply relatively quickly. I bet it's an issue with their address book.

Whelp, I submitted my info to them and they're reviewing it. It was kind of wack that I had to provide a utility bill with my name on it (lol what if I live with someone who pays the utilities?) but we'll see how it goes.
@_date: 2016-12-25 03:09:27
I'm not really that upset dude. It's whatever. I'll just make another ACH deposit I guess and wait another 7 days to reup. But, that's 7 days and I don't like it. It means I have to conserve.
@_date: 2016-12-20 23:54:07
Well Walmart has a bill paying service, so you can technically launder money.
My big point is that KYC doesn't mean I have to give you a photo of my nutsack showing each wrinkle.
@_date: 2016-12-26 02:30:52
You should have clicked the "The vendor has been paid, gib bitcoin money". They have a moderator for those disputes.
That guy was a fucking asshole though. Sorry man.

With circle gone, good luck LOL

Which country in particular?
@_date: 2016-12-25 23:43:23
No, I just chill on badeconomics a lot and we get a lot of posts from Futurology. I honestly don't know about their sub but every time we hear about them, it's usually along the lines of, "We need UBI because the robots will take muh jobs."
I don't even hate UBI. I think UBI would be a fantastic replacement for the bureaucracy and arbitrary judging you get out of welfare. However, their arguments just don't make any sense as an economist. It's pretty much scifi.
@_date: 2016-12-25 03:08:24
It's not that I don't understand why, it's more of a moral claim. Like, "You ought to be equally concerned and vocal with the negatives as you are with the positives!"

The winkle boys? Explanation required.
@_date: 2016-12-25 23:28:28
I'll put aside my contempt with Futurology and their singularity/automation masturbation to say "Yay!"
@_date: 2016-12-25 03:45:29
My bank will probably deny an instant buy because it's a foreign transaction (company is based out of Scotland). Thanks though!
@_date: 2016-12-22 21:32:20
Try Uphold or Coinbase. Those are the two realistic US options that I'm aware of. Coinbase is probably the safer bet as it has been around longer though.

Come on, hit $3k so I can buy a gram of wax.
The peak had me at $2 short. Please go back up, daddy. I've been dry for 3 months. ��
