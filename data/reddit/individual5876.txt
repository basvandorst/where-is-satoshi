People always say this, but they never give any specific regulations. The onus is on you to show which regulations have positive benefits - imo it's a little shortsighted to praise regulation generally.
**Which** regulations are necessary to ensure the wide acceptance of Bitcoin? If there exist such regulations, are we sure that there aren't things we can do to perform these functions voluntarily?

Edited language to reflect this.
In my mind that's the whole point of crypto-currencies. At least that's what I'm interested in them for - creating a self-regulating market that doesn't require a central issuing organization.
Business will adopt Bitcoin if it helps their bottom line. That means it needs to be usable at the point of sale, secure (check), and non-volatile (this will come with POS integration).
We should seek guarantees by setting up the system itself. In any case, this makes an appeal to regulations generally - I am yet to see one which would benefit the Bitcoin market. They universally take power away from individuals and place it in the hands of regulators.
There are some things that will likely be necessary. An easy way to calculate tax off Bitcoin, for example - would be a desirable thing. I'm only requesting that this not be the **only** way of doing things. It's all about choice. If businesses require legitimization through taxation at the POS - let them have it.
What's important is that these things aren't inherent to Bitcoin. YOU should be who decides the extent to which you reveal your Bitcoin dealings.

Businesses aren't going to be investing in bitcoin - as in, keeping it for long periods (at least for now). Business will, however, accept Bitcoins at the point of sale that are instantly transferred to fiat currency.
If customers demand it, businesses will provide it. At the moment it's very demographic based - lots of coffee shops and hipster food joints are starting to accept Bitcoin, as are online businesses (I see it around commonly).
If Bitcoin gains acceptance in this subset of the economy, it'll have a chance at widespread acceptance. Some innovations stay with that subset, like Linux. Others catch off and become the cell phone or the internet. This was one of the better points of the Senators :)

That's a really nice color, thanks :)

Obviously it's not anonymous in the sense that all transactions are logged and freely available - but it is anonymous in that you can easily tumble coins and make it pretty difficult to trace.
Also: 
In any case, this is a problem, yes - but we're trying to find solutions.
