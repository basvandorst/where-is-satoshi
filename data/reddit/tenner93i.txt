Trezor is open-sourced.  The only piece that is yet to be open-sourced is the boot loader, which Stick from Satoshi Labs says the following: 
"Keys stored in the bootloader are public as asymmetric cryptography is used there. There is no security reason why bootloader should stay closed, but we were quite hesitant to open it because that's the last piece of mosaic that our competition is missing from making a perfect TREZOR clone."
So likely it will be fully open-sourced in time.  As for the price, I think it is quite reasonable given the difficulty in creating such a secure device, and being the first to market.

I agree, but your post may have confused people into thinking that the entire Trezor project is closed source, which is far from the case. So I wanted to clarify it for people.  I agree it would be better if the boot loader was open-sourced now for peace of mind.  But you can't really blame these guys for keeping it closed for now so the competition has to work a little harder to bring a clone to market. They invested a huge amount of time and money into building this device and deserve to profit off of it.  It seems they plan to open-source the boot-loader in time.  The price is already set by the market, and as the first hardware wallet to market, at $119 its a bargain.  Welcome to capitalism.

You can use    You can have her pick the money up in a bank, or receive it on LBC, Cebuana Lhuillier, M Lhuillier, etc.  Not sure what ID is needed for these.
