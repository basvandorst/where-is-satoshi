i think is safe to buy any used ledger s, you will connect it to ledger live when configured and any tampering will be detected if some. there is security chip inside with signed firmware.  security level is the same like in visa cards. so you can be sure there no tampered ledger devices in market at moment
@_date: 2018-07-30 18:38:48
