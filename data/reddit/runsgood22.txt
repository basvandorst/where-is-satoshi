I am 36 and have been waiting a few years now for the moon.
@_date: 2019-03-25 03:59:16
I am already doing all of this.

Give me some ideas. Because the pussy I will pull with that I don't think could get better.

I wasn't trying to come off that way in the least. It was more off a hopeful moon post. I don't think that around $25,000 give or take is much money. I'd also think that many people of this subreddit have much much more. Sorry you felt as it it was trying to brag. It really wasn't.

Umm okay. Thanks for your input. Not sure if you ever heard the term but sex sells.

So it should mean that a bitcoin casino should be fully legal by those standards correct?

I think some of my comments are not showing up. I just said the pussy is not for me. It is for my business associates.

It doesn't work over TOR.

I already have the right person. The women aren't for me. They are for my business associates. I want this car to impress some high up people.

Just got this message and came here. Thank you @_date: 2019-04-13 23:35:20
Awesome thanks for this explaination. What about if you sent it to a gambling website then pulled it out and crossed chains for another coin? I know that monero is the easiest way but wouldn't pulling the coin off the chain for another coin effectively work also?

Or time.
