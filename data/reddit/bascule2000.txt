I won't try to predict the technological innovations around bitcoin. But I think the price movement is easy to predict; bitcoin is still in a bubble and the price will continue to fall.

Buying bitcoin is not investing, it is speculating.

It means the price of bitcoin is detached from any fundamental value.

There's plenty of people selling it already.

We might reach a point where it is uneconomical to mine bitcoins, and transfers become very slow. Perhaps bitcoin will become vulnerable to a 51% attack. There might be other problems with bitcoin that I don't know or we can't foresee. While bitcoins themselves are scarce, cryptocurrencies aren't, and what economic activity currently takes place in bitcoin could easily use another cryptocurrency.

The *price* is whatever people are willing to pay. Perhaps the price would be the same as the value if bitcoin was entertainment, or something else intangible. But many here treat bitcoin as an investment, and as such we ought to be able to value it. Corporations are often valued at a multiple of earnings, bonds on the basis of the interest paid and the risk that the borrower will default. Bitcoin pays no interest, or dividends, so using those valuation methods it has 0 value. 
If we treat bitcoin as a currency, it's value would be a product of the strength of the bitcoin economy. There is no bitcoin economy. The closest it gets is payments for illegal goods over the darknet; even then, the suppliers' costs are in other currencies. I can't see any way to value bitcoin above 0.

It won't be a store of $200 value if others value it lower.

What is the value of a bitcoin?

Sane market manipulators **buy** before good news.

It is possible to value things. Investing in a bubble is not a good investment.

Watching people lose money, mostly.


Any cryptocurrency could fulfill this role, it doesn't have to be bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 03:02:53
Good point. It should be impossible to spend bitcoins, that way the price can only go up.

The technology is new, the economics aren't.

Bitcoin has no earnings.
