Not true, even at minimum wage $100 can be made in a day.  Risking one days worth of work if there is a small chance of huge gains is worth it to me

Can I get a refund ?

$100 is a lot to me, that’s 5 weeks of food.  I thought bitcoin would go up and help me get more food

One small can is about 80 cents 
I used to buy chicken for $1.97 lb but i felt the tuna was cheaper.  On a $/lb basis this may not be the case but when I eat chicken I think I probably end up eating way more Bc it tastes better haha

I’ve learned to be very frugal as a student and I cook all my own food 
That includes fruits, veggies, grains, cheap proteins (eggs and tuna)

I saw it growing exponentially and was betting it wasn’t at the peak
I was wrong haha

Actually the fact that u are actually able to be down $2M and I’m only able to be down $100 shows that you are the okay one Bc u have a lot more money to invest in the first place.  Want to lend a helping a hand ����

I actually wrote this post awhile ago but I guess I kept it as a draft or something Bc I guess it never submitted.  This morning I was messing with the Reddit app and a notification at the screen said something failed to submit, I clicked it and it posted this old thread ��
