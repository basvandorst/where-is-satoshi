It's not what Bitcoin can do now, though the comments below are valid, it's what it can or will do in the future that's interesting.  Startups can innovate with Bitcoin, it's hard to innovate with Banks.  There will be an Amazon.com or Google or Facebook moment for Bitcoin.  Those services we now take for granted were hard to imagine when Internet first started.

This is an interesting argument.  However, the Government's War on Drugs, with its messaging and infinite resources has hardly put a dent in the demand for drugs.  If Bitcoin is demanded by the people, then it would be interesting to see if it can be sufficiently banned.
