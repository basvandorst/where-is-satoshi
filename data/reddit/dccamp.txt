Personally I would wait for the market to crash a bit more. Next major support is around 8K. So maybe wait till then if you want. 
But the truth is no one has one clue what the fuck is gonna happen. Just educated guesses.
If you're in it for the long run. (I,E years) and want to forget about it. May as well buy now.

Not the most educated on the subject. But what I believe drives up the value is true scarcity. Same reason gold shot up in 2008 and 2011.  Can't just inflate the value like you can in typical currencies.
Just my two cents

Bitcoin made it so some drug dealers and prostitutes were able to retire. That's pretty awesome if you ask me. About time the demographic of the 1% changes.

That's the plan. But trying to take some profits while I can aha. Must be my wallet then.. using blockchain Wallet and it always takes days whenever Bitcoin is going parabolic. Even when I send the max amount of sat/B
