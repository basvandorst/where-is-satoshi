When I click the "Receive" tab in my Bitcoin client, there are no addresses showing.
Apologies if this is a really stupid question, but how else would I find my wallet addresses within the client?

The value in the dollar is the strength of the government behind it. The strength of the military of said country and the general acceptance it has by the mass majority of people. I don't see any of that changing for a long long time. And if it ever does there's probably going to be a hell of a lot of suffering and misery to go along with that change, until yet another government backed fiat currency rises. Rinse and repeat.
Right or wrong the dollar is what the majority of people want and what people use on a day to day basis.
I was simply pointing out there are certain ironies behind Bitcoin... The whole notion that a single person owns so many and is so mysterious, is sorta like the central bank owning and controlling so much fiat currency and being so mysterious in how it's spread around between countries.
And I just found the idea of people saying 1 man could crash Bitcoin's "price" as rather amusing.
Either way I still love Bitcoin :)

Obviously it's very poorly written... But the fact they have a working smtp.com account sending under the official info address is slightly worrying. Also I'm curious as to how they got my email/knew I was a Bitstamp customer
@_date: 2014-12-09 12:07:55
Sorry to repeat things, but I was looking at it this way...
For argument's sake let's say you have a safe computer... You download the official Bitcoin application, encrypt your wallet and then save said encrypted wallet on an encrypted USB drive. Then on another encrypted USB drive you save your wallet password in a text file. You then put those 2 USB drives in a secure location.
How is the TREZOR more secure than that in terms of storage? Surely it's not. Because if anyone gets access to your piece of paper with your seed on, you're screwed. If someone got the USB they couldn't do jack with it because it's encrypted. And even if they somehow broke the encryption, they still would only have 1 piece of the puzzle. With the TREZOR all you need is the seed and you have access to everything.
Or am I missing something?
@_date: 2014-12-06 09:42:11
Thank you, I did try that just now but to no avail
@_date: 2014-03-15 12:18:52
Why not 150 coins if you're so confident Bitcoin is a "mirage" and will fall flat on its face?
@_date: 2014-12-07 16:50:30


Just a follow-up on this... I've ordered a TREZOR and should receive it shortly. However I had a question in regards to the recovery seed. They say:


How is that secure? Doesn't that mean anyone who gets hold of your words can steal all your Bitcoins? So basically in terms of storage it's as secure as having an encrypted Bitcoin wallet and saving the password by either printing it out or having it on a seperate USB drive?
Or am I missing something?
@_date: 2014-12-06 12:28:02
Updated the original post... I honestly think someone has stolen my coins. I never made those 2 outbound transactions (as far as I remember) and they are for very strange amounts for 100% of the total (leaving me with exactly 0). It's just too weird.
This whole experience has really put me off Bitcoin :(
Like I said I'm not completely clueless when it comes to computers. I love the idea behind Bitcoin and the technology isn't to blame, but hell, if this happened to me it can happen to many other people too. I guess I'm just grateful this wasn't 70 or 700 coins!

I fund my Bitstamp in Euros (from and to a Euro bank account)
@_date: 2014-09-09 07:17:12
Everyone is saying how if he had said he was dumping Bitcoin it would totally crash the price... Does no one see the irony in that? Everyone bitching about central banks and how an elite few control the system and yet Bitcoin the savior of mankind's financial World is so fragile that 1 guy could crash it
@_date: 2014-08-22 13:42:18
I've used Bitstamp for well over 15,000 Euros worth of transactions (usually in smaller amounts of 1,000-2000) and never had any problems whatsoever. Never had the new verification thing, never had arrogant support, in fact they've been pretty damn amazing and all my deposits have reached them within a couple of days.
Obviously I can't speak for everyone, but from my perspective I don't know why anyone in Europe *wouldn't* use them
@_date: 2014-03-09 19:37:40
Or the US government could just buy up a fuck ton of Bitcoins (7 billion is absolutely nothing to them) and be one of the majority share holders of coins. Or just make it illegal in the US. Either/or would have a pretty devastating effect on the notion of Bitcoin being "government proof"
@_date: 2014-08-11 13:09:22
Please may someone calculate how many Bitcoins they are mining per day or week? Thanks!
@_date: 2014-12-06 12:04:35
Recuva finished the scan and found no wallet.dat files within the specified folder. Here's what it found: 
So I guess I might be screwed.
I will take your advice though and disconnect this drive immediately and use my backup.
I've been thinking why this happened and it might be because I formatted my machine before this and used a new wallet.dat and then sent my latest Bitstamp to there. And of course forgot to make a fresh backup.
Thing is I have all the exact addresses that I sent money to in Bitstamp. Is it possible to generate a wallet.dat from an address and use my password to unlock it?
Thanks again for your help :)
@_date: 2014-12-09 12:02:51
Okay got it :)
It's funny you say that though because my first thought was to store the recovery seed on an encrypted USB.
I suppose if you never accessed that USB on a device with Internet access it would be alright though?
@_date: 2014-12-06 09:41:18


I just did this now and was actually quite excited when it was rescanning. I thought for sure it would work, but unfortunately when it finished and started it still showed 0 :(
Interestingly enough when I look in transactions, the latest transaction is August 26th, but the type is empty and the address says "(n/a)", even though it shows an amount. Never seen that before... Perhaps an indication of a corrupted wallet.dat?
@_date: 2014-12-26 09:45:25
In terms of investment he's completely right.
If you had bought $1,000 of Bitcoin at the start of this year, it would barely be worth $600 now. A 40% drop in under a year. No one can deny 2014 has been terrible price wise for Bitcoin.
And fact is no one knows what will happen in 2015 either. It may drop to $100 for all we know, or lower. That's one of the reasons I would never advise anyone to buy Bitcoin as an investment. It's just way too risky and volatile.
Buy Bitcoin because you believe in the technology and you have a day to day usage for it, not because you want to get rich quick
@_date: 2014-09-09 10:40:04
They might be able to print it, but it doesn't mean it will have value. Every time they print a dollar it loses a little bit of value.
The power in currency is people wanting it. And right now the dollar is still king, because people still want it. Hell, pretty much whenever someone talks about Bitcoin they mention it's dollar value... Another irony I guess :)
@_date: 2014-12-09 11:51:32
Okay thanks. I guess the idea then is the recovery seed is like physical gold and you have to look after and protect it as such.
The advantage of TREZOR is that you're eliminating the digital compromise (malware) problem, not necessarily the real life one
@_date: 2014-03-24 21:57:58
Good luck with that taking off.
Bitcoin has a hard enough time as it is appealing to the masses. This kind of stupidity doesn't help
@_date: 2014-12-09 12:21:11


Oh man that's awesome! I love it :)
@_date: 2014-09-03 09:57:44
Has no one asked how many Bitcoins there were? I find that the most interesting part of the story!

Whatever the case, the individual sees the address "info in his email client/browser. That's enough for a lot of people
@_date: 2014-12-09 12:00:11


Thanks for the reply.
This is honestly not really my concern. I've never had any problems with USB drives going bad or deteriorating. Long term you may be right, but right now I just wanted a secure way to store my coins.
The real problem in my opinion is that you can have an encrypted USB and the moment you mount it using TrueCrypt EVERYTHING on that USB is vunerable (assuming it's being attached to a computer with malware).


I made a thread about it on here and someone was nice enough to look into it for me, but nothing came of it. I've accepted now the coins are gone and I won't recover them. In a way it was worth the loss to kick myself into gear and have a complete security overhaul. Even though I was taking way more precaution than the average computer user, it obviously wasn't enough :)
@_date: 2014-12-06 09:58:29
Just to clarify... I should be using Recuva on my main SSD right?
When I loaded it up I specified it to search the Bitcoin "Roaming" folder within "AppData".
Apparently it's 93% done and found 84,000+ files thus far?
@_date: 2014-12-06 09:45:09


I've bookmarked their site and will definately look into this. I have a couple more coins in Bitstamp, but quite honestly this whole experience has made me question my ability to use (and store) any amount of Bitcoin over 1.
I know it's by no means Bitcoin's fault, but losing $2,000 so easily (and potentially a lot more) is just not something I want to do
@_date: 2014-12-09 13:41:52
I have trouble remembering my debit card PINs. No way I'm going to risk this!
@_date: 2014-12-06 09:46:34
Very true. I got complacent for sure. Probably because I've formatted a thousand times before and never had anything like this happen to me.
Also in the back of my mind having multiples backups of my wallet.dat I guess I thought I was safe.
Expensive lesson to learn :)
@_date: 2014-02-20 15:01:48
They will never send you the coins you buy. They are holding people's coins even now and refusing to give them back
@_date: 2014-12-07 16:45:04
What would you recommend as an alternate form of backup?
@_date: 2014-12-06 09:28:30
Thanks for the advice.
Yes I'm using Windows 7, never really got into 8.
I downloaded Recuva as you suggested (think I've seen this before). It reminds me of CCleaner!
Anyway the first thing you said was turn off your machine, but Recuva is a Windows based application...
My hard drive is an SSD and already half full with my new installation, so I'm not 100% sure this is going to work. Either way Recuva is scanning now!

Bare in mind this guy has gotten rich selling gold/silver, emergency food and jewerly (the very things he's talking about in this video).
Not that I necessarily disagree that it's a good idea to keep some emergency cash outside the system, I can also see that leading to a lot of problems for people (getting robbed and such)
@_date: 2014-12-06 13:39:34
Kinda scary when a billion dollar company who is meant to protect your data (and by default privacy) says "why does somebody need to be anonymous?".
It's the sort of thing you expect from a silly little Internet troll trying to piss people off
@_date: 2014-12-09 12:22:48
Will remember that, thank you :)
@_date: 2015-01-14 11:59:30
haha right. Was a bit strong I agree, but this isn't really a game. A lot of people have lost a lot of money in the last year. And the general attitude and borderline delusion you still see run rampant amongst the cryptocurrency community is pretty sad
@_date: 2015-01-14 12:20:43
Maybe instead of downvoting and replying with childish attacks, you might actually want to point out why it's drivel. That's generally how adults communicate with one another
@_date: 2015-01-14 23:14:51
By my calculations you're already down $6,624 (not including the $400+ in fees). Congrats!
@_date: 2015-01-27 18:11:49
I don't assume anything in regards to why they bought coins, just why they're hyping it and coming up with random numbers out their asses.
But think about what they're saying for a second... A 1 trillion market cap and it's currently less than 4 billion. So the price of bitcoin will have to go up 250x to reach that estimate... As in $65,000 Bitcoin.
Guess it's not as silly as people saying 1 million per Bitcoin though
@_date: 2015-01-10 11:17:30
What's scary is how the Bitcoin community just seems to forgot Mt. Gox ever happened and still continues to pour all their resources and trust into a couple of main exchanges
@_date: 2015-01-27 14:27:36
They would say this. They own a fuck ton of them.
@_date: 2014-12-09 11:54:29
Thanks for the reply.
Not sure how or even if my computer got hacked. If it did then I'm pretty sure it was a compromise via TeamViewer.
Yeah I understand now that TREZOR is a good step for protection in relation to actual computer usage, not neccesarily offline protection.
I think their company motto "The Bitcoin Safe" is a little misleading
@_date: 2015-03-06 12:51:09
Just use version 2.2.1. It's the last good version of the program and still works great
