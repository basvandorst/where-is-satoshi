obviously what we mean is you can fit more tx on the wire and on the hardware, period.  
the game theory of mining is separate in this context.  you can say it is artificially limited **because bitcoin requires mining**, for example.

crypto currency does not require a block size or mining, and even for cryptos that do mining, block size and block time can be set to literally anything
bitcoin and litecoin are essentially the same thing, but one does 7 and one does 28 tx/s.  this difference, as well as the reason that both of these numbers are so small, is due to a **limit set in the software** which is different in each of them.  an artificial limit.
a certain DAG currency does not have a blocksize, and is able to scale to a relatively very large number of tx because it does not have the artificial limit

maybe the artificial limit is there for a good reason, but i was explaining why it is an artificial limit

they are artificial in that they limit transactions before a hardware does

if you think it is trivial, shut down one of the DAG currencies by spamming it
invest in a competing currency to gain financially from the attack

only IOTA uses coordinator nodes
only IOTA has a double spend issue of the current DAGs
IOTA tangle != DAG

The idea is that, if there was no block size limit, all transactions can go in the next block.  I guess you can add "mining" to the reason for a fee market
