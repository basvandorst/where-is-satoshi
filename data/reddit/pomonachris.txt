Bitcoin ATMs I'm sure are cutting into this market too

Also totally missed mentioning all the bitcoin ATMs in Vegas and the D Casinos involvement

Courts need to make a ruling on this. Seals tokens are not ok but zynga tokens are ok? Very unclear environment.

I want to see Satoshi's train set he's been working on since his teens. Imagine how sick that is if he only worked on bitcoin for a few years. His passion for building model train sets led him do develop bitcoin because international transactions were too costly. Too adorable.

Hello reddit! I'm the Coin Cloud owner. I love bitcoin. I love the privacy it can achieve. I love liberty. It's what attracted me to bitcoin over 3 years ago.
It is not an easy decision for me to collect personal data on my customers.  I much prefer for things to stay anonymous. Unfortunately, I've decided to live and do business in a jurisdiction that requires me by law to play their game whether I like it or not. 
I decided to use the Robocoin product because they actually do the best job of all in protecting consumers and operators under current laws. Customer data is encrypted and not released unless requested by law. Palm vein scans are really just proof of identity. There's no government database for palm veins (unlike finger prints).  For operators, it helps us identify bad actors and stop doing business with them. 
I empathize if privacy concerns prevent you from using my machine. Nobody is coercing you to use my machine and if complete anonymity is your concern I encourage take your business to locatbtc or another jurisdiction. I am in business to give consumers more and better options than currently exist.  I love bitcoin and want to continue to grow the ecosystem. 
As an operator in the bitcoin space, I do my best voice my opinion and what little influence to advance issues of freedom, consumer privacy, and personal financial freedom. My goal is to work with the community and the powers that be for the purpose of attaining better outcomes to that end.  
Thank you for expressing your concern. I encourage us all to speak up as a community and let our problems be known. Ultimately, we can work together to solve them.
Your support - and criticism - is much appreciated.

Why spend (tip) bitcoin when you can spend cheaper Dogecoin? People expecting their future bitcoin value to be higher than future value of Dogecoin.  Has to be related to Gresham's law.

I own a Robocoin ATM. I make around 1500-2500 month in revenue and pay 1000 a month in rent. Honestly hasn't been as great as in investment as I thought given startup costs, legal costs, and required floats of btc and cash. Maybe that changes as bitcoin becomes more popular. I'm happy to help onramp people to bitcoin though!

eh, this could happen at any of the other 500,000 locations around the world too

If the gox issue is with the core protocol why aren't the other exchanges having similar issues?

Removed in case you are right. Not trying to get anyone in trouble . Friend thought it was a cool story and worth sharing . May be overthinking things here too

Sadly, I found this to be somewhat accurate of the quality of booths at the Miami show. Definitely some legit players at TNABC too but just too many guys in over their heads or downright swindlers

Very good reason is that people don't know what they are doing when filing taxes or don't have good enough counsel? Couldn't this be argued for basically the entire country?

IRS/FinCEN/BSA compliance. Building out initial and ongoing compliance program is really costly. My company Coin Cloud operates a network of 10 BTMs. Even at scale and having a full time attorney as a co-founder we haven't made any money yet due to legal and compliance costs.
You could risk trying to go "under the radar" and hope nobody pays attention but it's not something I would advise doing.

The Golden Gate is owned by kind people that own the D and they both have been accepting bitcoin for over a year now. The sign is new and it's awesome marketing for bitcoin!

Hey, Chris from Coin Cloud here. Been having a few issues with new software push from Robocoin last few days with buy transaction being frozen. They assure they are working hard to resolve the bugs. Nobodys lost funds. I've just been processing the orders manually that have frozen (a very small %).
