I agree... Don't want MtGox to die, just wanted them to have some competition.  Its always costly to be first in such a highly regulated area of business.

When did they go live?
@_date: 2014-02-07 11:27:02
I'm curious, why do you have any BTC sitting on Mt. Gox, or any exchange for that matter?
Why are you even trading on Mt. Gox? The warning signs have been there for years.
@_date: 2014-02-07 11:15:53
Why does anyone have any amount of BTC on ANY exchange, let alone Mt Gox.  And why do some IDIOTS have LARGE amounts of BTC on any exchange.
Hello, its a decentralized currency.
I'm sorry, but there are plenty of previous incidents that provide ample warning.

Keep this crap off reddit.
Bitcoin doesn't need another Bruce Wagner.
Trace Mayer's law degree is from a 4th tier diploma mill in Southern California, so his law background is the kind we DON'T want anywhere near Bitcoin.
Anyone that calls themselves a "Bitcoin thought leader" needs their head examined.

How many did you order?
@_date: 2014-02-18 02:58:57
Lol... They also thought price would double when the block reward halved.
@_date: 2017-03-24 03:30:54
Then don't come over here.  Stick with the scammers, scum and technically illiterate over at All 10 of you , lol
@_date: 2016-01-15 20:22:24
Actually this is GREAT news for bitcoin
@_date: 2017-03-24 03:31:36
says the idiot, lol

Has you're pathetic leader sold his BTC for BTU?  Yeah, didnt think so.
BU is doomed to fail, lol
We're just pointing out how absent of logic everything is that comes out of BU, complete amateur hour over there. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 02:43:34
Pretty much this.
@_date: 2017-03-24 02:49:40
lolz ... get a clue
@_date: 2017-03-24 03:26:50
BU is such a joke that it's absent of all logic, lol
Oh boohoo, no one wants to hear what I said, I'm being censored.
No, what BU has to say is useless, so it's moderated like all spam.
@_date: 2017-03-24 03:23:04
awww .... upset because BU is doomed to fail, lolololol
@_date: 2017-03-24 03:24:06
don't worry, theyre punishing themselves.  It's amateur hour over there, lol.
@_date: 2012-02-07 01:04:13
I know where that background pic was taken ... too funny.
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:35:44
I don't think you properly understand Bitcoin.
It's slash and burn.  Apple has a stake in the old way of doing things.  We don't need them and we don't want them.

Worst interview ever.  Seriously ... Jinyoung is an airhead.
I think a two year old could have done a better job confusing  everyone.

No, bitstamp is not safe.  They violate most privacy standards by REQUIRING that you upload documents with personal information.  Sending digital copies of your photo ID and utility bills to foreign companies is not recommended.
With both Coinbase and CampBX you only have to link your bank account.  (Coinbase also requires you verify your phone number.)  The other forms of verification are optional.

I'm curious ... Why didn't you accept BFLs offer to send you the equivalent in singles?
The singles are completely "set it and forget it" and wouldn't require AC at 75 ambient.  They will also be much, much easier to sell.

oh man, if this doesn't say it all(from her bio):  "she served on the Romney/Ryan Presidential Transition Team"
Talk about believing in fairy tales, lol.
How is Bitcoin attracting these losers.
@_date: 2013-09-11 21:40:33
Great, all bitcoin need is another crazy scammer like Bruce Wagner.
His law degree is from a 4th tier diploma mill here in Southern California, so his law background is the kind you DON'T want.
Anyone that calls themselves a "Bitcoin thought leader" needs to be kept as a far as possible from representing the bitcoin community.
And runtogold.com? lol
@_date: 2013-03-09 01:19:52
you nailed it ... we need real vendors, not people masquerading as vendors to make a quick buck.
If they were above board, they'd disclose the product source so that a visitor knew who they'd actually be doing business with.
@_date: 2013-03-15 07:46:47
The domains you're holding are HORRIBLE... absolutely worthless. 
Regional bitcoin domain names?  For what?  It's a global currency. (this is a rhetorical question so don't bother answering it). 
If you cancel them know, you'll save $2100 in renewal fees for 300 domains.  That's more than you'll ever make of those domains selling them, squatting on them, or spamming them with useless ads.
note: I've been buying and selling real domains since 1997.

bitcoin isn't ready for it yet ... and that's ok
the  thing that's hurt bitcoin is scammers and losers that have tried to force things before bitcoin was ready.
Patience and natural adoption will lead to the success of bitcoin, not hucksters, snake oil salesman and Burt Wagner's.
@_date: 2013-03-09 01:07:45
shady ... support real vendors, not an affiliate marketing site that was thrown up and is now asking for handouts.

650W/GH seems really high for an average of the network.  Even my low end GPUs do 375W/GH
