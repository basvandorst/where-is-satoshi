You're using the economics term floor incorrectly.

We always chuckle at people with NY plates here in Jersey. Or give you the finger for holding up the left lane.

Good thing they're American and registered with all proper government overseers.

Their phone reps are flat out rude. Speak to you as if your a 5 year old.

Any half assed counterfeit will pass the iodine market test no problem. The hardest two security measures to replicate are the ridges in the chest of the president and the magnetic ink(which only counting machines can detect).

New Jersey cheapest in the country and we don't pump our own gas.

It's more about jobs at this point in NJ.

leave it to to troll so hard. I'm aware that a .pdf followed by a .jar is a malware. I was unaware of how easy it was to spoof an email sender address and I wanted to alrert the community.

Thanks I really enjoyed the elegance of your final paragraph.
@_date: 2014-08-13 00:11:22
as is FinCen

I'm sure of it I'm just curious how they obscured their sender address.

The amount of money and manpower used to investigate counterfeiting rings must be spent. If its not they would run rampant and cause (hyper)-inflation. So the cost to benefit ratio is a no brainier for the government.

HFT occurs on milli-micro second scale. The fastest trading bot I saw was a cryptsy bot which could trade on 40 second resolution time. Keep in mind HFT are literally meters away from the stock market servers ( check out leasing office space in the nasdaq server farm in Mahwah, NJ). Between the servers and apis of exchanges (and the unknown location of BTC-e) a resolution of even 1 second trades might not be possible.

It takes two seconds to check your bank acct on your phone. Cash deposits show up immediately.no reason to trust the receipt.

You should amend the title. A modest proposal made me think that this was a satire piece. It being a satire piece is the only reason I clicked on this.

Next time you're in the area stop by andy's bar in Bogota on queen anne road. The crowd is older but the greatest nicest people ever. Great craft brew selections. Oh and Billy Joel frequents this bar as its his favorite.

Keep in mind only because you probably shoved it down her throat other than that in 2013 nobody in that room would of heard of it.

You need to get a license from Fincen and every state you operate it in and need to do your due diligence and prove you are doing it. You're talking millions in attorneys fees and compliance depts.

Has anyone considered that part of Chases decision on this subject stems from their recent patent filing?
