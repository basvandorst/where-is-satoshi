Just in case anyone else has this problem, you can log into your 50miner account here: 
From here you can pay out to whatever destination you want.

they are doing the same with the 5GHz
"Upgrade from 5GH/s (or 4.5GH/s)  to 7GH/s for $100"
If it's a scam...they suckered me into the deal on this increase ;)
I had emailed them back in the middle of March asking when they expected to deliver. They said the following:
"We are working to start shipping soon and have a backlog in the queue, so recent pre-orders will likely ship sometime in June, sooner if possible.
Thanks for your patience!

No sooner did I post this, that I found the following on the btcg site news:
"...the 'NMC Account Balance' is now part of the Dashboard regardless of your settings. This is only temporary until the rest of the Dashboard updates are pushed live.
If you're not familiar with Namecoins, do not worry! NMC is produced with BTC simultaneously. You do not lose any BTC or mining speed while generating NMC."

I emailed BFL a short while back in mid march. Made my purchase in Feb. Below is the string:
Can you give me a rough estimate on the turn around time on the 4.5ghz Jalapeno is?

lol way to get hated on here ;-)
@_date: 2013-05-10 13:42:57
LOL well I know that it is volitile. I've been watching it like a hawk the last six months or so. I have just never seen it bounce up from 116-121 w/o a reason before. That doesn't really make much sense on any level.
Not that I am complaining at all. I made a nice chunk of change because of it. :)
@_date: 2013-11-01 09:43:25
I would most concerned abput my coins being havked. A single lication storeing tons of bitcoins as investments sure ounds like a tastey target for greedy butcoin hackers. Not like it hasnt been done before!
@_date: 2013-05-01 18:40:51
it's been so volitile lately that I'm sure everyone was just waiting to see which way it would go. When I saw it hit $120, i knew it was going to collapse. I love days like this!
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:17:36
Absolutely. there are plenty of bots out there. you can find 'em easily enough. Even free ones. But they aren't effective unless you have a lot of funds to back it up. 
They will sell off batches (making the price fall a bit), let everyone panic (making the price plummet), then buy in the rest of their funds and watch the price climb.
@_date: 2013-05-10 16:01:49
okay, okay. I get it. I'm not as experienced as some of you guys. 
CM just didn't update the data on the candlestick until a several minutes after the fact. It displayed on the volume chart, just not the candlestick. Before it could display all the data for the big buy in, the last few minutes were all showing as flat lining in purchases with no major movement. Must have been too much to calculate effectively in real time. Or there was huge lag from the Gox server due to the big purchases.

The fact is that no single person has the answer. While I agree that things are exciting right now rather than crazy, we have no solid hypothesis as to what is coming next. 
The gov now has a huge cache of bit cons (excluding the confiscated coins) and that they don't want to destroy the btc, it doesn't mean they wouldn't manipulate it to their advantage. This amongst all the other people with tons of btc venturing to the same end.
My best advice is to just watch the market like a hawk.
@_date: 2013-10-07 14:32:52
Thank you! I'll check it out!
@_date: 2013-11-14 13:44:26
Awesome. Thank you for the clarification. It's one of those topics where I could not find even a close answer to my question at all, anywhere.
@_date: 2013-06-14 02:46:38
I can understand your POV. But, if you look at the date when their original design was implemented to now, obviously technology has increased in performance. They probably changed their original model's specs to be up to date with current tech and/or more stable architectures and didn't want to have to keep using old hardware because of the lack of performance or stability. As well as the risk of having extra stock over time of a bunch of outdated hardware.

I use zeroblock(which I found off the clarkmoody site already listed in the comments).
@_date: 2013-05-10 18:33:18
Now that makes perfect sense for the jump. Thank you for clearing it up.
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:22:57
Worse case, I suspect it'll be chased around by governments wanting to get their grubby lil hands on being able to tax it and control every aspect of it all because according to their standards, the power of BTC belongs in the power of the feds. Canada is already trying,  politely (as that's the Canadian way). Wait till US or Russia or China try to step in. *ACK* (not that I am comparing one to the other)
@_date: 2013-11-01 18:18:37
ROTFL I had no idea I misspelled so many words. That's what I get for switching my spell checker on my iphone. I deserve all the bad comments that come my way for that.
@_date: 2013-10-07 10:18:10
i would agree. I just received my little jalapeno last week. Have been making about 3 bucks a day tops. Suddenly I I made about $12 in a 24 hour period between Friday and Saturday.

The big bad gov doesn't care about the small time fries. They pretty much only care about the big sharks in the ocean. Which make sense. Get rid if the big guys and there will be no one for the small guys to buy from. And thats the illegal stuff. People that don't deal on the "bad forums" have no reason to worry about anything.

It's beautiful. Based on such volatility, you can see amateur buyers/sellers make snap decisions based on tiny ripples. which enhances those ripples. If you are patient, you can use that to your advantage. Soon as the bottom fell out I sold out. Because I knew a tsunami was comin. Waited for the losses to plateau and cashed back in. It looks like the floor stabilized at 110ish. not bad at all.
The regular stock market is boring 99.9% of the time. Primarily because of all the financial factors associated with the specific tech, business, industry even political aspects. Here though, it is fun almost 95% of the time because the almighty BTC has none of those factors tied to it. Sure you have some big players manipulating the market, but we know that, and we happily play along for the ride. You win some, You lose some. But don't get emotional, otherwise you'll be eating your hat.
For those that bought in high, they call 'em ripples because they have ups n downs. We just had a big downward ripple. From the looks at the trend, we'll have a few more..guess what comes next. ;)
But as Braveheart says...."hooOOOOOOLD! HOOOOOLLD!! NOOOW!" :D

Thank you for your input! I personally always wanted to hear the perspective from Wall Street. I definitely didn't expect that bcs were so unnoticed (shows how uninformed I am).  But with the average player age being 65 is a good example on how there I think there will be a shift (albeit minor at first) on the horizon.
A universal untraceable monetary unit capable of being used for exchange is something "the people" would accept with open arms. The difficult bottleneck of transferring funds into bcs and then knowing what to do with them has definitely kept it from being a successful venture. I have read of people buying bcs and not knowing what to do with them once they bought them. A bit extreme imho, but no less relevant. BCs are a lot more difficult to traverse and grasp than any other form of monetary unit.
The lack of popularity will keep us underlings on our toes because the bc is susceptible to being manipulated. I grieve for those that bought BCs at $260 thinking it could possibly go up more.
I personally hope it never gets recognition by nations as a player on the world market because that would call for a significantly reformed bitcoin system. Something controllable and moderated. Which is exactly what bit coins are not. I never have and never will like "controlled".
The hobbyists, those looking for purchasing goods, and those that buy bcs and don't know what to do with them will keep bcs alive until it becomes a more prominent player in the big leagues. Me personally hopes it never gets there.

True. Daily volume does grow. But the difficulty to create btc increases all the time to match the growth. Which imho does keep a noose on letting the btc run out of control. 
I imagine, the more the btc volume grows, the more stable it will get as long as the difficulty level always matches the volume created.

don't feel bad, it would have taken longer than that to actually get your cash transferred into coins.
