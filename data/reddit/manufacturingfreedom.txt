Bitcoin is just one option for a payment method.  The bitcoin is sold immediately for dollars.
They may even use Bitpay, can't remember.

You gotta HOLD your GOLD.
Not your KEYS, not your COINS.

This is the correct answer.   
Peter offers BTC as a payment option and it is instantly sold at market value for dollars.  It could be even using Bitpay, not sure.  
I listen to most of his podcasts.

I think Ponzi scheme is accurate.
I think you're focusing on one aspect of negative rates, which is about the money in your account rotting away.   
But the meme is actually about the other aspect, which is about how/why loans would occur in an environment with negative interest rates.
There's 2 parts to a Ponzi scheme, the first you've correctly identified.  
1. A Ponzi scheme usually claims to offers high returns at low risk. 
2. The Ponzi scheme **generates returns for older investors by acquiring new investors**.   
The 'returns' are **based on using new investors' funds to pay the earlier backers**. 
**Therefore the meme is pointing out the way in which central banks have consistently lowered interest rates for 40 years  in order to 'stimulate' the economy &amp; finance government spending, is the Ponzi scheme**. 
Lowering rates, and drastically cutting rates during crises, is used in order to fuel more borrowing and inflate asset bubbles again (housing, stocks, bonds) essentially bailing out the older investors by encouraging new investors to take out loans which would raise the price of the assets.
They lower rates for current borrowers, in order to keep spending in the economy and maintaining/raising the asset prices for older borrowers or members of the economy.
When a central bank does this over and over and over again for 40 years, lowering interest rates to near 0% and are now discussing negative rates, it's a ponzi scheme.  Once they are at -2% they will discuss -4% and so on.  It's a ponzi scheme.

Truly dystopian.    
The sooner we get money out of the control of governments/CBs, the sooner we regain our sovereignty.

He currently sells/hosts his show on Russia Today, but has also worked for BBC, Al Jazeera and Press TV.
He says by far the BBC was the most oppressive, controlling and censorship ridden place to work, which is why he left after 10 episodes. They didn't allow him to say anything about Israel.
He says Russia Today has given him the most freedom, and have never told him how to run his show.
