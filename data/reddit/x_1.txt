Your method is great, because physical security is easy to understand, and digital is not.
Keep it in mind that you also need to protect against damage; Not just theft. Keep a second copy in a lock box or some other off-site location in case of fire or flood.

There are two reasons you might receive a small amount of satoshis (or 1) from an address:
* **Blockchain Bloat** Some people use blockchain.info's feature to attach a message to their transactions. These single-satoshi payments turn into an ad campaign.
* **Big Data Mining** Sending a single satoshi to a wallet in hopes that the wallet owner will make an arbitrary payment in the future that uses that 1 satoshi input alongside other inputs. In this way a data miner can link bitcoin addresses from the same person/wallet.

No thanks.

I thought: "Oh, I've never heard of phonezip.com before. Let me check out their website."
Ended up wanting to purchase a phone plan, went to checkout, made an account... And they've disabled bitcoin checkout. "Please use another payment method" like hell I will.

No. Sending a satoshi will only link the address they sent it to with another address in your wallet if you spend that satoshi in a larger transaction.

There's your problem. Cash out now; You don't understand bitcoin.

Stop treating Bitcoin like a religion. When something is good, you don't need to sell it.
You want to see the bitcoin economy grow? Enter it.

The only people I've met who argue that free money is a human right are people with little to no valuable skill. Imagine that.

I like Byrne, but he is very bad at delivering a presentation.
I'm only on slide 8 and he's already lost me. Why? Because the slides are poorly designed, and he's opting to read the slides instead of communicating with an audience... This is frustrating.

I've used this website for exactly what you're trying to do and it works great. Bitcoin accepted.

at localbitcoins.com you can find a trader in your area to meet and do a cash for btc transfer.

Me and friends use millibitcoins. It's not too complicating TBH.
It eventually just got shortened to m. e.g. "Can you send me 100 ems? I can pay you back tomorrow"

Why is it a problem? If someone stays away from a technology, not for technological reasons, but because of some deep-seeded gender issues they have, they're only limiting themselves— Not bitcoin.

Subtle shitlording. I approve.

That's your problem. You're attempting to force someone to do what you want and nothing else.
You want to have your cake and eat it, too.
The lesson is: If you want anonymity, don't ask for it. Just take it.

Here's why:
* You create a wallet with this private company
* This account effectively groups ALL transactions ever made with it to an individual.
* If a SINGLE transaction in your account is tied to your identity. ALL transactions are tied to your identity.

Maybe others aren't, but I am. I generally like picking my own passphrase to protect my money. This seems obvious.
@_date: 2015-02-05 16:25:52
Do you use Bitcoin? You are in a very small minority.
In general it is better to have a bank manage your money. It is a bit paternalistic but I can see a big reason in doing so.
If you don't trust Banks you can still use Bitcoin, but hook your wallet up to a Bank and give them all information on your Bitcoin transactions.

How are you not getting this?
The blockchain and bitcoin network is pseudonymous. Your CELL PHONE is not. For fucks sake.

You're sharing every transaction you make with this private, centralized company.
