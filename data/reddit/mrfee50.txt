im just trying to understand what happened to bitcoin. Its kinda like when that good underground rock band gets popular and then they sell out and start to suck!
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:52:46
i dont understand why everyone thinks im a troll doesn't this need to be talked about with bch being more profitable to mine?
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:52:11
thats my plan!
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:46:07
i been following the debate since the beginning i been in btc since it was a dollar a piece. it is my understanding that the community is split on the scaling issue. and i didn't say what everyone wants. we know for a fact what satoshi wanted. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:43:13
didnt bitcoin just go up a significant percent in a small period of time lol
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:01:05
'In five days, the price grew 1000%, rising from $0.008 to $0.08 for 1 bitcoin' let me guess you where a bitcoin doubter then?
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:58:46
wait your saying that we shouldn't be discussing the possibility of bch gaining on bitcoin even with it being a large percentage more profitable. you want to be one of those guys with his finger up his ass when everything blows up?

im not promoting mining i couldnt give a shit about tat. its just bch is always described as an alt coin and discredited here i just think people need to be aware that there is a slim chance it could become the dominate chain. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 01:22:38
how so?
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:50:00
It is a serious question. one that everyone is going to have to decide for themselves in the up coming months. With BCH now more profitable to mine than BTC it could very quickly become the dominate chain. The problem is people are not happy with the way the dev handled the scaling situation and the community.

What about new york agreement thats almost no one and over 80% hash rate? im just saying we might be sorry if there is another fork and this time 80% hash rate goes away and doesn't come back

BCH 700 and going up. I just don't want to be assed out if they flip. I mean how would you feel if all your BTC where worth nothing tomorrow and that bch you sold off without a second though for 300 bucks was worth 4k?
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:50:48
i dono cryptos seen to be prone to quick sudden drops and quick sudden ups
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:01:23
my thing is why sell BCH? it was bassicly free and if btc price dies and bch takes over you would be in horrible shape if you sold your bch its just not worth the risk to sell it rn.

The fear is bitcoin is moving toward being a "digital gold"... a store of value... The problem is if you cant use it it has no value. People will not only not use it, they will buy something else. So i hope the segwit solution core pushed/forced on bitcoin works. Because their jobs and bitcoin's legacy chain depend on it. There are alts out there with Instant confirmation and next to nothing fees. 7.51 to send 218 dollars is bullshit you can send money at wal mart to wal mart CHEAPER. Guess what its instant cash to cash. This is on you CORE for not compromising on scaling keeping your digital dicks in the sand... AND this is on you BIG BLOCKERS for doing the same damn thing. Now that we have a bitcoin with big blocks and a bitcoin with segwit i hope at least one chain survives because the lead is not as big as it was 2 years ago.
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:56:50
oh the majority didn't want bigger blocks, at worst close to half did. oh wait Your right its not like there was a giant debate with a bunch of meetings and conferences. Wasn't there even some sort of agreement people had to sign. but no when there is consensus that short of thing happens anyway. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 10:26:39
oh no my 46k is taking too long :( hard life man i really empathize with your situation 
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:52:58

@_date: 2017-08-26 07:14:21
where do you eat that accepts bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:46:54
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:14:13

@_date: 2017-07-31 03:10:06
