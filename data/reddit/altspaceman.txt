Price down pick up. 
Wait till its at 25K in a few months and everyone is complaining the price is too high to buy

canadian owner must be smokin some good bush weed with those fees.  
so does anyone know of an exchange where you can custom change the fee if you want a lower priority transaction sent?  
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:21:36
your such a joke...fck off and go back under your fiat rock you've been hiding under for years now.  
good luck with your worthless usd euro or peso or whatever the f you have left in your account, its worthless
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:42:56
JUST CLOSED MY ACCOUNT...SEE YA NEVER.  HASTA NUNCA!
Even closing the account was a painful process.  Had an outstanding balance of 0.08eur and tried to withdraw it but minimum was 10eur withdraw so I had to desposit some LTC sell it just to with more than 10eur then wait a day or two for transaction to finalise then login again and finally close it.  terrible service.  Soley using Bitstamp and Kraken sometimes going forward.
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:00:53
bitstamp is by far the best exchange ive ever used.  only downside is if you sell to eur seems to be only the lower side of most quotes ie gdax etc.  but i should be punished for going back into shit euros haha.  but def the best exchange to buy btc by far
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:13:31
..and alot of these websites like bitcoinfees.earn.com are misleading saying use 230 sat/byte now
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:01:56
no its a bit more complex than that. 
basically your account is credited this amount but hasnt fully cleared..right, meaning you can't take it out yet.
Then you get annoying emails all weekend from localbitcoin and buyer asking why you haven't released the btc yet.  your account shows it pending.  buying sends message all weekend starting from friday night perfectly timed.  raises dispute and localbitcoin starts to require info from your bank account and basically after awhile you think its probably a bank issue the funds haven't cleared yet.  
The world is pretty fck filled with scams mate and cryptos will bring out the best of our shit race.  
Just look at NEM and UK trader this weekend.  I really hate banks but at least you won't get held at gunpoint for your euros or USD in your bank account.  
Some fck genius out there needs to figure out how to create a third party consensus mediation for extortion, fraud, theft, etc from cryptos and he/she will be become a billion overnight

BEHOLD...CLUELESS ASSHOLES OF THE WORLD
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:25:57
so do they pocket the massive difference when fees arelow like now?
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:11:31
why the f is binance charging 0.001 BTC withdrawal fee with no option to set your own fee
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:26:32
This is very healthy consolidation period after extraordinary gains.  Then it will put in a bottom somewhere between 10k &amp; 13K and then it will raise onwards and upwards as new money flows into the exchanges and the technology advances.  
Don't over analysis it and get caught up in the day to day noise.  Look over 3 to 6 month periods.
Most people make poor decisions and sell what is not doing well and move into what is doing well.  Right now you do not want to sell any bitcoin want to consider slowly accumulating small amounts as it goes down that fits within your plan.  If you don't have a plan with entries/exits/defined % risk etc your gambling. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:39:21
I am ready and cashed up to buy alot tomorrow if they do this.  
I hope Japan and SK stay awake as well and smash these fucks, teach them a lesson to go short their worthless bonds instead
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:09:27
or 60k/70k 
glad to see all the 'hot' dumb money is subsiding and just us real hodlers are left.
and yet again bitcoin survives attacks from banks shorting the futures, dozens of countries reg the shit out of it, bch and coinb spamming it, china being china....etc
creep back up to 15k from here
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:52:51
bingo....just like the fake vendor above...just like the fake myetherwalet site...just like cut and pasting ur crypto address after visting pornhub...just like etc etc
Moral of the story is never use a btc/crypto payment for anything till your 100% its a final irreversible sale.  Maybe someday a genius with come up with solution to this but for now thats the rules of game.
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:34:07
I got scammed on localbitcoins.com for $5K, was angry for a few days, rang the bank nothing they can do etc etc.  Long story short a buyer made a 'cash' deposit at an atm over the weekend and the funds appeared in my account so I released the btc but later the bank found the deposit wasn't cash but a fake check.  Gone forever.  
I think its all part of the learning curve with bitcoin.  The trick is to lose a small account and learn your lesson so you are super careful forever going forward.  We are so use to using banks/credit cards sometimes can help us with fraud to recover funds.  The word irreversible are hard to grasp for new bitcoin owners.  A term with amazing power and freedom yet can be dangerous if you make one mistake.  With bitcoin you are now the owner of a small bank, use this freedom and power with severe scrutiny and due diligence with any thing you with btc or any crypto.

@_date: 2018-09-01 16:37:22
Don't worry...your young and will earn it back.  The bigger question you need to ask yourself is will you risk too much again.  
I have worked with hundreds of different forex traders over the years and only a couple out of a hundred would do well mainly because they understand the math and how to manage risk.  You don't need to kill it, you just need to stay in the game.  Once you've done well on an investment like Bitcoin for example, let some of the profits run.   
@_date: 2018-09-17 22:19:49
The BISQ platforms works really well...we just need more liquidity.  Trade amounts and volumes are low and can take a long time if you want to sell any reasonable size.
I just don't know why alot of us aren't using BISQ and so many people on LBC still.  
@_date: 2018-09-01 16:25:38
Heres the summary:  
You should use mathematics and never risk more than a few % of your net worth on a single idea.  2% to 5% is good.  That's it.  At the absolute max max 10% if you have an extremely high level of confidence it will work.
This allows you to have multiple losses in a row and not get knocked out of the game.  If you loss 10% you need to make 11% back to breakeven, doable.  If you loss 50% you need to gain 100% to breakeven and not doable unless you risk a huge amount again.  This is how top traders manage risk.
Sorry you had to experience this first hand but it sounds like you got greedy. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:08:43
exactly.  and most of us have made so much profit it doesn't matter now.  for me bitcoin would need to go to a negative -7,300 for to break even.  
too many newbies on here that don't understand what they are part of.
@_date: 2018-09-19 19:42:30

I agree, it takes only one mistake.
And everyone on here is a pro at it till it happens to them.  
There are a large # of variables that can go wrong especially if your someone that is accessing/transacting quite often.

i day trader forex for 4 years and in the end its a mugs game and really the true winner is the exchange or broker.  moving shit around costs money.  and timing the forex market was hard enough i couldn't even imagine trying to time the crypto market with consistent success.  but good luck if its working keep doing it
@_date: 2018-09-05 16:12:20
i would have thought with everything that is going on in the world now bitcoins price would be significantly higher.  Its being manipulated by people that don't want to see it gain popularity.  They keep printing more money to short it haha
@_date: 2018-09-05 21:14:51
It has similarities to LBC but quite clever how btc is held in a wallet where you have priv keys.  
Then when you make or take an order btc is held in escrow where both sides need to confirm before any release.
Probably the biggest downside is application needs to run all the time or your orders can't been seen if your computer goes to sleep or application closed.  
@_date: 2018-09-12 09:38:33
I can't believe people are selling their bitcoins at $6,200.
Morons mind as well just give them away, at least burn the private key / wallet, and properly give them away.

I had Tor running and must have VPN open and running for it to see the transaction

yeah got the samourai app notification saying received btc but wallet doesn't show the transaction
@_date: 2018-08-15 17:20:06
yep...spot on. 
I believe bitcoin ETF would do more damage than good in the LONG run.  We are better off without an ETF period.  In the long run an ETF would get hacked (inside job) Mt Gox style and then everyone will blame Bitcoin is not secure, lost all my money, etc etc  
ETF  = not your keys = not your coins  ... how is this a good thing?  And people buying the ETF will never use a wallet or understand a single thing about the technology and therefore zero adoption or true ownership.
Again trying to use the old system for the new system.  Lets bundle Bitcoin into an ETF, f great idea....1990s all over again, so how many faxes an hour can the internet send?
@_date: 2018-05-08 14:03:16
just a bunch of greedy old corp american men...pissed off they missed the boat.

He freaked out..rang me and said he read an article saying bitcoin could go to zero and as t the moment the only logical thing was to sell it at $5900 which is better than zero. 
I think alot of people get into massive trouble with lack of any exit entry level of risk trading plan.  There is only three things you can control entry exit and % risk everything else is out of your control hence the reason its meaningless to watch the price day to day.  But alot easier said than done.
An exit plan can be as simple as spend 10% on strippers when it reaches a new all time high.  Sell all if it falls to $800 or whatever.

Someone should develop a 'coin' that erases your memory that you own bitcoin, safely stores them, and wakes you up every 5yrs to remind you do.

So...who gives a crap?
Yet another bank trying to save themselves before they go out of business.  I love how they always pull the 'anti $ lauder' crap as an excuse.  
Why don't you dickheads tell the truth.  'We have stopped accepting crypto ex transactions because we are afraid of going out of business, losing our jobs, the fiat we deal in is worthless, and once the world realizes the the convenience of the alternative we will become the next telephone booths on the street gen z can't even figure out what they are for.

No, but having the discipline to hodl something as volatile as bitcoin for many years and not get spooked is why one should be rewarded.  Being right is one thing, but being right and sitting tight is not a common trait.  
@_date: 2018-04-01 19:43:51
Thats GOLD mate
@_date: 2018-04-25 10:41:11
Agree &amp; ditto to that!  Bitcoin hodlers feel wealthier and spend a bit or alot more helping the economy.  
Better than realestate &amp; gold wealth which is locked up and can't spend a little bit more till you sell it, especially if its your primary home.

I hope someday some genius solves this problem.  We should be able to use biometrics somehow as a backup to our backups, something 100% full proof no matter what happens.  I am confident alot of smart people are working these solutions as I type.  
Its easy for newbies with a few hundred dollars in their wallet to say to lostjmpass should have done this should have done that its easy, but they don't realise the level of responsibility that comes with having &gt;million dollar wallets.  One starts creating extremely complicated backup upon backups layers of projection to ensure someone doesn't steal it all and then just one tiny silly fuckup and its all over red rover, you secure yourself out.  Think about how easy this can happen combined with the number of real world variables which could happen..fires, mental disorders, comatose loss of memory...
And I wouldn't kid yourself by saying, i do this i do that and also this so therefore its impossible this could ever happen to me.  I guarantee there is a scenario (of low probability) that could happen to everyone on here where they would lose everything.  Seriously think about it.         
And I agree banks aren't safe either however generally there is lawsuits,government help some attempt to recover the funds.  And most importantly, if a person lost their money they can blame it on the bank fucked me whereas with cryptos you feel 100% responsible you fucked up.  Its easier to tell your family bank fucked us instead of I forgot this word and our savings is gone.
I know for sure this must be fixed for bitcoin mass adoption and I know we will fix it someday.
