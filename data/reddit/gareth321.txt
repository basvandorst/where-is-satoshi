The Kraken website has been broken for months. I tried signing up 30+ times and every time the site failed on document uploads. On an ITIL standard, this would be a critical issue, meaning everyone should have been pulled off project work to fix it. So either there is a total lack of leadership in dev and product, or more likely, they are critically under-resourced. Either way, I would stay the hell away.

Than it's an awful currency. Currency is meant to be a store of wealth, not an investment vehicle. If people can't rely on the value staying relatively static, it's impossible to use as a currency. I feel we really need to get better at being consistent about this. Is bitcoin an investment vehicle? Cool, so it's not meant to be a currency. OR, bitcoin is a currency. Cool, so it's not meant to swing wildly like this. How do we fix that?

It's not black and white. "Hurt" could mean physical. It could mean emotional; maybe financial. Money laundering involves obscuring the evidence of a crime of goods or money.

How can you be sure there will ever be a majority of people holding bitcoin for currency purposes?
@_date: 2015-01-21 22:29:59
It boggles my mind that this was upvoted.
A substantial number of bitcoin holders can get together and radically alter the price overnight. They sell suddenly, killing the price, then buy at the bottom and repeat. This is why currencies are regulated. Otherwise a wealthy few ruin the currency for everyone else who actually wants to use it to purchase things. It sounds like you're fine with that though.
@_date: 2015-01-21 23:43:55


You obviously have no idea how markets are manipulated. Any size market - including the US currency and fucking oil - can be manipulated.
So you are of the opinion that bitcoin is not currently and should never be a currency. I disagree. But you keep on encouraging people to use bitcoin as an investment. See how far that takes it.

I literally covered this in the very same message:




Once again, I literally covered this in the same post:


As for this:


You are treating bitcoin *solely* as an investment vehicle. I literally, specifically, said that this form of manipulation makes bitcoin useless as a currency. I was under the impression we were intending for bitcoin to be used as a currency. Was I mistaken?
@_date: 2015-01-22 01:03:05
Of course you did. You used a poker table analogy. That is investment. Or do you think currency is actually gambling?
@_date: 2015-01-22 21:07:28
So, like a religion?
@_date: 2015-01-22 02:01:22


This is where you are fundamentally mistaken. Giving a person a goat in exchange for a pig is not gambling, ceteris paribus. Currency was devised so that people wouldn't have to haul pigs with them everywhere they went. The currency was backed by the empire, crown, and later state, government, and often using an asset such as gold as backing. The only way that currency fits its purpose is for it to maintain a relatively constant value, otherwise the fake pig in one's pocket is only worth half a fake pig the following day, and no one wants to use fake pigs anymore.
Massive fluctuations prevent people using currencies. Period. Encouraging that behaviour prevents its adoption. If that is your intent, continue to do as you are. Others certainly are, and they will continue to do so unless the behaviour is discouraged. Regulation would do this. I cannot think of another effective control.


Yes of course. Just like the only difference between walking down the street and conspiracy to murder is intent. We make the latter illegal because murdering people is bad. Just like rapidly devaluing a widely used currency is bad.

We're also down 65% on two years ago. You can't just pick arbitrary periods and proclaim BTC to be a stable and reliable store of wealth. It's a fun play but it is little more than gambling at this point. Research shows that most price movements occur from just a handful of large holders. Given its decentralised nature, this is a recipe for manipulation. Currency and trading regulations are literally forged in blood. They exist for very good reasons. I get the appeal with decentralisation, but only if we are honest about the potential for manipulation, and only if we have realistic solutions. Right now I don't see any, so BTC could not and would not become a mainstream currency.
@_date: 2018-06-11 07:53:03
I think I agree with the issues inherent to the system, but we differ on what they are and how to solve them. I see capitalism as the problem. There have been incredibly smart and educated people throughout history who preached the dangers of unregulated capitalism, and all of those warnings are coming true. The endgame of capitalism is total amalgamation. One mega-corporation which owns everything. It's happening. The number of media companies in the US has been reduced to just six media companies controlling 90% of the media. Disney is on track to own all major studios within a couple of decades.
So I don't see giving even *more* control to these organisations as sensible. They need less. Much less. And the only way I see that this will occur is with strong and unwavering regulation. Here in Denmark the government really is "for the people". Laws aren't built around protecting corporations. They're built around protecting people. And it works. I believe the US could do with much more of that.
@_date: 2018-06-11 14:25:01
You've written a lot so I hope I do a response justice.
The first thing to reply to is the notion that we have departed from capitalism. I would say that we never had un-impinged capitalism at all. It has always been a compromise between the interests of capital owners (the powerful), and everyone else. I think this balance was better understood in earlier decades - the upper marginal tax rate in the US in the 40s and 50s was close to 100%! - but there has never existed the total laissez-faire, free market I have seen described in libertarian communities. It exists as a thought experiment like socialism has been relegated to. As the US moves further away from being worker-centric, and more towards empowering the already powerful, we will see lower taxes for the already wealthy. Decreased regulations. Fewer rights for workers. So I see the way forward as a reversal of this. Unfortunately, this requires an educated voting public. Given the continued cuts to education, and the continued amalgamation of media, I see this getting *worse*. Ignorance breeding ignorance.
So I guess I agree with your premise that our system of governance needs an overhaul. I just don't see that happening without a lot of pain. Us humans are creatures of security and habit. I see things getting worse before they get better.
I also fully agree with your point on perpetual growth. At some point the music is going to stop and it'll be everyone after the Boomer generation who is left without a chair. Think Japan, but everyone.

Remember that the US economy is worth $20 trillion. Bailing out even a billion dollar company is chump change, and wouldn't even register on the needle. In fact, the US has been flying high on QE since 2008, and instead of causing rampant inflation (what you are describing), it's been flaming some very healthy economic growth.

This is a common misconception. When markets retreat, gold drops. In fact, during strong bull markets, gold *also* drops. Gold only rises during stagnant or lazy bull markets.
I, too, hope that crypto turns into a vehicle for capital flight. But I’m not convinced that will happen.

Yes, they are. Everyone seems to have a hard-on for a lack of regulations, but the regulations in the US finance industry are top notch. Your money is incredibly safe in a company like Robinhood. In fact, in the event of a total economic catastrophe, the US government literally prints trillions of dollars to give away free money to bail these companies out. Do you think they would do that for a crypto exchange hack? Fuck no. Your money is *faaaaaaaaar* safer in there than any crypto exchange in existence, by a huge margin.

No one is taking away your right to your body, time, and resources. You see, your country is a collective. Anyone who joins the collective is required to contribute to it. It's far more efficient in this manner as there aren't competing providers for basic utilities, for example. If you no longer wish to be part of your collective, you are free to leave. What you want is to claim you don't need to contribute to your collective despite deriving all sorts of wonderful benefits - the least of which being the ability to grow up free from diseases and starvation.

No, the monopolist would calculate the MC = MR price point. This is usually significantly above competitive prices. This also results in a significant deadweight loss.


This sounds exactly like the existing structure in most municipalities around the world. Where it makes enormous sense to share infrastructure, infrastructure is shared.
I suppose the smell is dependent on a lot of factors. I've lived in one house which used one and there was a smell at times, but the tank was quite close to the house. It could have been an older model, or was poorly designed.

A septic tank on each property is the most rational option in this context, but it's still a stunning waste of resources. There's also a high upfront cost to households. It costs anywhere from $5,000 to $20,000. Based on waste charges where I live, that investment represents 9-33 years worth of waste payments. If we multiply this throughout the country the sunk costs are inconceivable. It's true; eventually the waste company will have to acquiesce. It will just take an enormous number of customers buying septic tanks first.

You didn't read the example all the way through. How would that provider enter the market given the upfront barrier to entry? 50 households could never justify the cost of installing new lines for $30 million. The company could never recoup that investment and the households could never afford that cost. What then?
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:55:40
This doesn't seem right. Government agents are given targets to meet. Their job performance translates to continued employment and their wages and bonuses. Of course government agents have an incentive to handle taxes efficiently. Perhaps you're talking about government policy regarding taxes? If so, the government is directly elected by the people. If the people do not feel their taxes are being spent appropriately, they need only elect a new government. This is a more equitable system, since every person has one vote. The model you're referring to would have the rulers beholden to those with the most capital. In other words, an approximate oligarchy.
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:49:34
Ah but rich people are never going to install septic tanks unless they have a very large section. Septic tanks carry an unfortunate smell (they must be ventilated). Additionally, they carry the serious risk of back-pressure (overflow), which is a disaster for any home owner. Further, we haven't considered the cost of maintenance and emptying every couple of years. I also think you've made a mistake in thinking that the wealthy (those who could afford to unexpectedly fork out for such a system) would make enough of a dent on the national scale to deter such a monopoly. Few people have up to $20k they could spend tomorrow if their rates were raised as much. Could that 5% really scare the waste company? No, because they know most people aren't wealthy enough. And this is assuming these customers have the space to install tanks. It's impossible in cities, for example. So suddenly New York doesn't have flushing toilets or showers. That would be an unmitigated disaster.

I think we basically agree on shared infrastructure then. We probably disagree on the methods, but to me, shared infrastructure makes clear sense. Since that's how it's currently set up in most towns in the first world, I don't really understand what we're arguing about anymore.

First and foremost, you were born into the collective. You don't have a choice where you get to be born. Some people are born on farms in China. Some people are born to rich families in the US. Such is the reality of the human reproductive cycle. You are subject to the rules of the collective you are born into. The alternative is that no collective may ever have rules, *just in case someone who is born objects to one of them*. Clearly this is impossible.
Now, utilities like power, water, and waste, require access to finite resources and physical space. Imagine a scenario where a private waste provider in your neighborhood increases prices by 10,000%. Fine, so let's let the free market sort it out, right? Well, it would only cost $30 million or so to add new sewage pipelines throughout the neighborhood. Far more because pipes need to be laid deeper, through rock, because of existing phone/power/sewage/water infrastructure already in place. But how can 50 households afford this $30 million cost? They can't. So the free market has decided that these people either pay an exorbitant fee for waste, or they can no longer use their toilets and showers. Even if these 50 houses *could* afford to install second waste pipes, the sheer waste of doubling up is astounding. Massive resources essentially wasted, because no local authority would have the right to tell the monopolistic entity to keep prices reasonable.
This isn't analogous to food production because food production is decentralized and easily transported. However, if there is proof of food production being more efficient under a central authority, I'd certainly be on board with the idea.
