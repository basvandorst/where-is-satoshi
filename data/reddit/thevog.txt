Fair enough! I'm glad we completely disagree, it just makes the world a more interesting place :)

You bring up some interesting points, but I can't agree with last one. That's a scenario where BTC co-exists with whatever comes next but remains a fringe currency. That means it survives under its own power though, which is quite likely I'd say, and not a bad thing.

Why though? For this to be true, BTC value / market cap would have to be a few orders of magnitude higher for it to make sense (and what HODLers are banking on) - which is certainly not impossible by any means, but... the question remains, why BTC? Nations aren't looking to buy into something they have less than no control over. If anything, they might band together and spin off their own. African nations and south-east asian nations would be absolutely perfect candidates for this, too! What's more, they would then have the ability to both market *and* natively integrate it anywhere they want right from the get-go.
I think BTC is both fascinating and quite historically significant, but it feels like a very elaborate case study without an clear end. I'm glad to be alive to witness it!

[The report]( posted above ends with a request for an arrest warrant and is dated October 29th. I don't think it's a stretch to say this is likely to have been granted in the week following the request.

Easy there SJW, save it for the thread parent. I'm just pointing out that it wasn't just one mistake. OP legitimately doesn't have a good grasp on the language, but beyond that I have no strong feelings whatsoever in the spelling / investment debate.

Sure, but every single comment the OP has made in the thread has incorrect spelling and/or grammar.

I have a low-risk portfolio that returns 5.1-6.4% per year like clockwork, so I dunno man. My crypto holdings are down 13% over 12 months.
