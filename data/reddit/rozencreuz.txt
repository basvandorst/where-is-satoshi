All the people of all age use Whatsapp in Finland. It's weird to think that that's not case in all western countries.
I still have my Facebook profile but I only log in like once a week or two to check invites for events if I remember. It is such a dead place. And the feed. It is a joke. There's nothing to see really. I never share anything. It would feel stupid, too personal. I have unistalled the app as well, because we are told every now and then how compromised it is.
However, whatsapp is owned by Facebook so technically they still got me.

If something, this Nordea is a joke.
Gotta love those double standards. Nordea has lost a lot of customers recently because of the bad publicity related to their unethical, possibly criminal financial activities revealed by the Panama papers. They have assisted elite customers not to pay their taxes.
Now the CEO of Nordea says that there's not enough regulation in bitcoin.
Furthermore, I wonder how they could ever ban something like investing to something... lol.
Wouldn't have thought they are that scared of bitcoin.

Sorry about my ignorance, but is LN already working and reliable?

It really isn't that difficult to calculate how profitable your system is BEFORE getting the panels.

There isn't much to see at the moment.

Only an idiot like me wouldn't sell his stereo equipment and car and put all in at 3000.

Also, commercial printers detect money patterns and won't even print them. Go ahead and try with your inkjet. They'll just print a warning and a link to an informative website.

Nice! Where's the all in button?

Better, but obviously, more problematic...

Internet and btc blockchain could be rebuilt after emp. Besides, catastrophies are good for btc in general.

Bitcoin private keys can be obtained relatively easily with the pliers method.
@_date: 2019-04-23 04:21:34
That'd be better.

Blockchain is fundamentally recoverable. So just like fiat, the bitcoin nodes would continue their work when system (=power, internet) would be recovered.

Not really. Here's an "official" Intel article about overclocking:
The unlocked Intel Core i9 processors mentioned in the article are vulnerable to both Meltdown and Spectre bugs, so in theory you could compensate those but like the article/advertisement says...
... functionality won't necessarily be "normal"
... additional hardware (like cooling and power supply) might be needed
.... it will shorten the lifespan of the cpu and other components.
Furthermore, I'm not sure if Intel has offered security patches to i9s yet. If that's the case, the compensation wouldn't be possible of-course (while there's nothing to compensate).

It is probably just a coincidence that they dropped at the same time. One shouldn't make too far-reaching conclusions based on that.

There was this lambo thing already before the dot-com bubble.
Here are the Rytsölä brothers (who lost their fortune later) and their lambos in 2000:

This is nothing. 20k and 7k are basically the same in exponential scale. After five or ten years, who cares if you started your hodling at 700 or 2000, or 7 versus 20, or 0.7 versus 2. In physics like this, they are basically the same. Please stop crying. No one is here for trivial 1.4x or 2.5x gains or losses. The target is 140x, 250x, 1400x or 2500x etc. This is bitcoin. It's all or nothing. And we all know that. That's why we're here. I'm not saying please hodl because it obvious that every rational and irrational person is here for hodling anyway.

Yes there surely is a risk, but in case of a solar storm that would destroy the digital infrastructure, a very significant part of our society would collapse. Fiat money is digital as well in practice. Supermarkets, gas stations etc. all need electricity and/or digital communication channels to be able to operate.
I think bitcoin would have fundamental problems if it couldn't recover from temporary internet/electricity blackout. 
But to take things further, think about the case where a strong enough EMP destroyed all the digital records in the world. This is also theoretically possible. Think about it really. All records would be lost from your bank account to tax information, from fiat to bitcoin... you name it. All the hard drives, all the flash memories... In that case, practically every office in the world would have to start from scratch (and all the blockchains as well). That is the risk the society should somehow observe. Too many areas of life and too many systems are fully dependent on electricity and electrical/magnetic storage media.

Their company Jippii Group (internet connections, java mobile games, ringtones etc) lost over 90 % of its value in one night in 2001. They had had millions of paper wealth but hadn't sold any of their assets. Instead of any realization, they had spent loaned bank money. Besides that, they had unpaid taxes from previous years becoming due.
After the bankcrupt, at least one of the brothers was also found guilty of aggravated debtor's dishonesty. His sad yellow lambo has had more than 12 different owners in Finland by now.

Uninstalled Mycelium or similar and the master seed on paper is one safe option for hodling.
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:34:39
That is just a theory based on the past. We don't know what happens in the long run, in the future. Maybe there will be other factors that affect the whole as well.

5-10 % + transaction fees here in Finland.

No, if you live in Finland, the small letters only tell that the unlimited 4G data plan will be automatically upgraded to 5G.

"I'm not here to talk about anything else but bitcoin" :D

In Finland, a bank called Nordea forbid their employees to buy bitcoin :D
