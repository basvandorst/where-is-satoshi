Very unlikely in my personal opinion.
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:36:49
I think this is the reason that everything is plummeting right now.

Where did I say Obama ruined my 401k?
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:18:48
Trump has it faults no doubt, there are some things that I wish he would do differently, but overall (despite some controversy) I think he's done a pretty good job in the first year that he's been in office.
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:34:37
We'll see ��
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:24:35
LOL that made me laugh, he does do some good things, just don't want to hear an investor's personal political opinions. I feel the same way when musicians give their political opinion, I'm like just play your fuckin music and shutup.
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:43:58
LMAO that is hilarious, I seriously check it like every half hour, it's pretty bad, may need crypto counseling.

Bitcoin ATM fees are atrocious, my first Bitcoin transaction ever was through an ATM and I paid close to 20%
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:09:06
No I don't think any of this is piggybacking off of Obama. Trump removing unnecessary Obama regulations are what jump started the economy. Illegal immigration is down because Trump has had a much harder stance on it than Obama did, increasing boarder agents two fold. Unemployment has dropped because companies are confident they're no longer going to get bent over like they did under Obama. Obama was the first president in US history to never hit a 3% GDP growth rate for all 8 years of his presidency. ISIS was running rampant under Obama, and Trump has put major pressure on North Korea by using China as a sidekick, and basically threatening to blow their asses off the map if they don't get their shit together. Obama was a sorry excuse for a president, the guy had less balls than Bruce Jenner.

There is no scam, read Bitgrail's Twitter page, he has already explained the circumstances, things will be resolved shortly.

That would be Kim Jong Un, followed by Roger Ver.

And furthermore do you really think I give a flying fuck what you or any other crybaby liberal loser thinks....Trump is our president, so you can bitch, moan, cry, and create a hissy fit all you want....it won't change the fact that he will lead our nation for the next 3 or possibly 7 more years ����

You can thank the Democrats for the shutdown, they care more about illegal immigrants than the well being of our military.
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:38:17
I believe you're right because we have another set of Futures set to expire on the 26th of January.

Ronnie is a dildo. I started following him on Twitter because I thought he provided some good crypto insight, then he started bashing Trump in his tweets so I deleted him, not interested in listening to an investor give their political opinion.
@_date: 2018-01-20 07:44:00
Of course it's both sides, but liberals have such a backwards way of thinking that it seriously makes me sick. California (where I live) is now a sanctuary state....need I say more.

Good time to sell? Horrible time to sell you mean....
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:14:44
Are you living under a rock??? The stock market is the strongest it's ever been, unemployment is at a 20-year low, illegal immigration is down over 70%, Trump has twice the GDP growth that Obama did, consumer confidence has been restored, ISIS has been severely reduced in the Middle East, and North Korea has just announced their willingness to restore talks with South Korea, yet you want to complain.... If the same amount was accomplished by Obama within one year's time you'd be calling him the second coming of Jesus.
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:46:49
Keep crying buddy....
Screw crypto, I should invest in Kleenex, because the amount of tissues that they'll be selling to the liberal community over the next 3 to 7 years is going to go through the roof!
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:55:45
And why is that?
@_date: 2018-01-20 07:48:50
I agree politics sucks.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:57:05
Not really, I have many reasons why.
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:56:53
Speaking of popularity....you realize that both of their approval ratings were the exact same at the end of year one right?

No....I just don't need to hear political opinions from those where it's not their space, it's like the mailman trying to give me advice on nutrition.

Makes no sense, unless you think Bitcoin is done....

That's okay....all you schwabs got used to losing under Obama, now that we're winning again you don't know how to handle it  ��

No sir....that was Obama
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:28:29
Horrible idea, especially considering the stock market is booming right now, would highly advise against it.

No problem 
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:04:55
My buddy purchased $24,000 worth of Bitcoin from someone off of LocalBitcoins, they transferred 4 Bitcoins (at the time) from their Blockchain wallet to his, he is convinced that if he sells it to another person off of Localbitcoins in the same manner that he will be able to avoid taxes altogether and not get caught.

A friend of mine is planning on pulling out half of her Bitcoin Saturday night in the event that the Market crashes on Sunday as a result of a major sell-off (people trying to cash in), then reinvesting on Monday. Do you think this is a good strategy, or not?
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:49:35
You realize it's already available on Coinbase and the market just crashed....
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:12:30
LMAO this is brilliant 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:40:14
Seriously enough with the joking, this is people's money we're talking about, do you honestly think it's going to drop that much?
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:14:23
Another girl that I'm friends with said that as long as your gains (what is sold for profit) don't exceed $20,000 in a given year that you don't have to pay taxes on it, is that accurate?
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:24:21
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:02:40
I completely agree, that and it seriously makes me sick to my stomach when I log onto Coinbase and see Bitcoin Cash now posted on their app on the front page.
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:29:33
Anyone think all of this negative publicity has to do with the whales flooding the market with bad news in order to keep the price low so they can win the futures contracts....
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:48:10
I would take Trump any day of the week over Ver.

I know someone who is a Managing Director for Goldman Sachs, just sent him an e-mail asking if this is true, will let you know what he says.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:50:32
Great, not what I wanted to hear.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:09:16
Do you guys have any good news by chance?
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:00:34
I sent it over in smaller amounts and it worked, thanks for the advice! 
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:14:47
I'm going to try this next time Bitcoin has a big jump and see how it works out.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:22:07
Why would Coinbase add Bitcoin Cash??? It's a blatant fraud....
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:45:10
I hope you're right, I miss the $17,000+ days :(
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:10:19
Is that what the tax percentage is for capital gains on crypto, 15%? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:23:16
So what happens tomorrow when BCH resumes trading on Coinbase? I'm starting to get a little bit concerned that BCH will skyrocket and BTC will plummet, anyone else thinking the same? Unfortunately there are a lot of uninformed people that will see the name "Bitcoin" Cash and associate it with the real Bitcoin when there is no correlation. Coinbase and Roger Ver are preying on those that don't know any better, this is wrong on so many levels.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:35:26
Thanks appreciate the advice, will give that a shot.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:00:37
Who said I would deposit the money into the bank....
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:22:08
Not if it's shorted by financial investors, which may very well happen, the price would absolutely plummet.
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:14:31
Exactly 
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:20:29
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:27:36
