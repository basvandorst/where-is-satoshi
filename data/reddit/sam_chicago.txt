The fact that the subpoena is in Dec 1017 and they have still continued issuing USDT is a good news. if it was a fraud they'd stop immediately.

LN= Lightning Network, it uses onion routing similar to TOR network. this enables a high degree of privacy within the network making all traffic encrypted by default &amp; unable to read except by the sender and the receiver.

Always pick segWit. Faster transactions.

no one is really being Owned in the video,  Roger has the same con artist sales pitch going on who obviously knows better that bcash would be just as slow with same amount of Tx volume but refuses to talk about it , whereas Lopp appeared non Bias, knowledgeable and quite eloquent.   
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:19:14
15k isnt bad at all, we might hit that right after futures expire this friday.

@_date: 2018-01-10 16:50:15
so sorry to hear about your loss, yea i would suggest to start with his computer, check the history and see if has visited any common exchanges, like Coinbase or Gemini. and ask mom if she by any changes knows any of his passwords.  try loging in. just dont post any info on the internet . or give that computer to someone you dont trust.  and as someone else stated look for a hard wallet device or a 24 words pass phrase.  search for trezor or Ledger Nano s. these are two most popular hard wallets available. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:23:36
just deposit your minimal amounts on an exchange and buy when you reach around $500, otherwise you'll be losing money. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:50:50

People BUY a hardware wallet and get your coins off of coinbase.  
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:22:39
Leave a review for coinbase asking for SegWit at AppStore, tweet about it, make some noise.

-Peer to Peer
Benefits: 
-nearly free transactions.
-Integrates with existing wallets.
-send micro payments
-Enables millions of txs per second
-reduces onchain congestion.

deliberately not implementing SegWit, resulting in a mass backlog with Bitcoin transactions and using that as propaganda against BITCOIN while shilling for a totally different coin called 'Bitcoin-Cash'. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:26:58
BTC going sideways between 13-14k during Korea gate and holidays is a very very healthy sign. For any noobs this is the best time to buy in.

What’s happening with the Mega wall on Gdax?

Never buy or withdrawn anything on coinbase , transfer funds to Gdax and Buy as market maker and withdraw for Free . 
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:07:00
because of Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:27:51
yes you will be just fine, tx might take up to 15 hours or so these days. Gdax has been terribly slow lately, so dont freak out.
