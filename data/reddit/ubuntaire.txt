I've used one first hand. The initial scan of your bitcoin address is 100% JavaScript and takes the longest to do. After the scan of the recipient btc address, you drop in the cash, say you're done, and the bitcoin is transferred. Pretty slick!

Feel free to ask of me to help with the documentation. I wasn't able to get the gateway up and running. I mean I got the service up but I couldn't connect to it.

It scans the qr code on your phone, you then insert cash into the ATM, push 'complete', and that amount is transferred to your phone. I've used one myself. It's pretty slick.

I'm not divesting because I'm not giving up on being the sole owner of my property. Yes I own gold coins too. I don't think banks deserve my money if they are going to loan it out 100:1.

“Bitcoin technology makes regulation largely unnecessary. The end result is that you’re going to see some pretty big changes. Those changes will be because there are now better ways of doing things, and people will choose those better ways. There’s nothing particularly libertarian about that. It’s simply a recognition that you can achieve in software what regulation has failed to achieve.”

Cashing it all into btc, only to cash some of it back seems like a waist. You should slowly cash in a percentage every paycheck. Rent is a big deal.

If bitcoin becomes centralized then why would anyone want to use its blockchain? Why not use a bank or central clearing house instead. Keeping bitcoin decentralized is the whole point of bitcoin as we know it.

I've written quite a few user interfaces, and I'm always surprised how stupid proof it must be before it becomes usable for the average human being. These systems are being so dumbed down that they barely function at all. Anything requiring too much configuration is considered unusable, there's always the tyranny of the default, and people aren't willing to spend the time to learn how it works. I'm always hearing or seeing people fail trying to use these systems. The reason most people don't use bitcoin is that they are too fucking stupid. If, at first, it requires them to think you've already lost them. People are lazy.

The banks will accept gold receipts, and you can buy gold with bitcoin online. Have the gold shipped to your house. Sell the gold at your local coin dealer for a check you can deposit into your bank account. The gold dealer will write you a check. Show the receipt you got from the coin dealer to your bank. For best results, don't mention bitcoin to them as it will make everyone suspicious. Remember, bitcoin is only used to buy drugs /s
