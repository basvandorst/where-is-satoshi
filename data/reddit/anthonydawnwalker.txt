It’s kind of a joke... this is obviously a very old applet.

I think Coinbase verified me in about 20 minutes when I first set it up! Hahaha

What the hell is Dirty Santa?!

With all this shit coming out of Coinbase, is there another system that would allow me to buy BTC from my bank account as quick and easy? 
I hear people talking about Gemini but I’m not as up on the technical side of things to know if it’s going to be as good for me?

I have absolutely no idea I’m afraid! I am totally new to this I’m afraid!

I’ve just realised I’ve been using this sub for months now and I wasn’t subscribed! I just went to it on my history everyday!! I’m in the club now!

I don’t work at or own a desk I’m afraid!

Hey those are rally nice!! I’m afraid I wouldn’t have anywhere to screw it to though?

All very good points! I was lucky enough to invest in bitcoin when it was around 8.5k just before the giant leap to 19k where I sold a lot and have since bought back in. I think since I’ve more than made my initial investment back I’m happy to stick with BTC for now! Now I just put abit it from my pay packet each month to add to the pot!

To be quite honest it’s because I’ve been holding BTC for a while now and I don’t know enough about the tech or all the other projects to risk what little money I can afford to put it!
I held some ETH but sold it all and sold the last of my LTC thismorning to buy BTC in this dip. I’ve read the most about bitcoin and I feel pretty comfortable with it, except the sudden jump in tx fees hahaha!
Hopefully that all drops down soon!

Cool I’ll check it out! I’m getting a ledger Nano for Christmas so I’m literally planning to buy BTC once a month, transfer to my Nano and forget about it! 
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:56:08
I know, but the blah blah blah is everything that everyone here already knows so I didn’t want to teach anyone to suck eggs!
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:31:27
Oh wow that sounds cool!

You can add BTC to the stocks app and then display it constantly as the stocks complication.
Don’t do it.
For your own sake.
