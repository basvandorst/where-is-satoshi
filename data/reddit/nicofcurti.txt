This is one of the key points. One thing is having a digital currency, and a completely different thing is the 'middleware' between consumers and decentralized currencies, which almost always is centralized

We algorithmically fix BTC on the price to avoid volatility on human handling transactions, so technically we don't "sell it". 
Being an early BTC adopter, though, I understand your position.

It did for all our customers so far :)
But who am I to say...go find out yourself!

Personally I’m more into decentralized currencies rather than shares tokenization.
This is just one more step towards mass adoption.

Why is people cheering for a Bitcoin accumulation from a single country?? 
I'm gonna be downvoted to hell, but you guys have 0 knowledge of how BTC works it seems, if China holds a majority of BTC (Which given its population, size, and resources, it can), then the "Decentralized" part key to Satoshi's dream success will be changed to "BTC is to China what Gold is to the USA".
/rant, go on with your lifes.

Argentinian here.
Taringa! was literally the latinamerican reddit 10 years ago, but mismanagement and some dark legal stuff destroyed it's reputation and now it's seen as 4chan for spanish speakers.
This acquisition's only winners are Botbol Brothers. They managed to exit a company that otherwise would've been dead in the upcoming years. Hope RSK can turn things around, but it wont be anywhere as successful as people think.
Taringa is not a trustworthy company and we'd be better off if they shut it down altogether.
