Based off of predictions other users submit yeah. Its like kaggle except for equities predictions. 
They give you data, you run a binary classifier on it [ie given this data will this go up or down], you upload your predictions, then they reward the best ones [in bitcoin atm]. Eventually the rewards would go up as it scales, still in the relatively early days atm!
@_date: 2016-08-30 20:51:46
The interesting thing is... we don't actually even know for certain whether people are running the data through neural nets [since people are just submitting predictions, not their algorithms themselves].  Although they probably are [I played around with it running it through some decision trees in python and got a logloss of about .69, so to get really high up in the leaderboards I imagine you'd have to do something much more advanced / sophisticated].

I like sidechains better because they're closer to real Bitcoin, as opposed to a spinoff which is just the same initial distribution as Bitcoin.  
For instance, let's say we're betting on something on Augur.  If we use a spinoff we have to create a new currency and then bet using it (with its own prices etc.).  If we use sidechained bitcoin people can just send their bitcoin to a special address and then use them on Augur to bet, they don't have to worry about acquiring an alt currency (spinoff coin) or what its price is.  
@_date: 2015-06-23 22:39:10
Pruning of the chain (similar to latest bitcoin changes allowing pruning) is one solution, although you still have to store the chain state trie of contract data (in a naive implementation). This would cut down on the size a lot.  There's a lot of other proposals here: 
Although I think a simple pruning solution is the easiest most practical thing to implement first.
@_date: 2015-06-03 00:34:35
I actually wrote some code to allow you to do just that, but I think more ideal would be sidechained Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-06-23 20:38:42
It wasn't.  Intrade actually did wrong payouts three times and people lost money wrongly.  With a decentralized system at least outcomes can be pushed back and reported on honestly later

Tony answered with regards to the alpha, but for the final version the user won't have to interact with, install, or run ethereum themselves.  It'd function much like an invisible backend as you say (we'd probably just package the node js version of ethereum with the UI and make it all one double click &amp; done sort of thing).  You could also have a sort of site like blockchain.info but for Augur.

Hmmm? "I’ll also be paying particular attention to the Bitcoin Dev mailing list to see if any debate begins about making changes to the core protocol to allow federated pegging to work directly."

Not exactly true as we plan to exist as a Blockstream sidechain.  He hates the idea that we are using Ethereum to build it (which we chose out of convenience and speed instead of forking Bitcoin's codebase).

@_date: 2015-06-27 17:04:48
Nothing :) - in fact our plan the entire time has been to be a bitcoin sidechain, but to launch using ethereum because it allows people to be able to use this tech immediately until sidechains come out

Reports are weighted, so splitting your reputation into different accounts doesn't really do much besides add extra work (filling out separate reports)

I can't think of a broader mass market application than prediction markets.  Practically every financial market can be implemented as a subset of them, add bitcoin to that market and you've got something pretty cool.

@_date: 2015-06-24 20:08:35
Only if we were never willing to change plans if Eth had some failure --- options include running our transactions in the same manner (distributed across nodes), but only committing hashes of the agreed upon state to the bitcoin blockchain (this doesn't allow for use of bitcoin though, so not too useful imo), making a limited augur transaction set version of eth and merge mine sidechaining to bitcoin, a limited tx set eris implementation but merge mined w/ bitcoin, and probably a few other things I haven't thought of.
We chose eth purely out of convenience and how it allows us to move fast, if something happens to eth we have a practically python codebase (read: serpent) ready to move to whatever wins out, or we can make a limited set of just augur transactions.  
As far as scalability, ethereum natively isn't really much more scalable than bitcoin.  It has an exponential moving average blocksize, but that's about it.  Later versions are what all the scalability proposals are planned for --- getting it right w/o scalability should happen before adding scaling features.
Edit: Vitalik has already implemented a first draft of a state tree pruner: 
Now looking here: Eth frontier release is predicted to be fairly soon according to the markets:   I doubt 2-way peg sidechains will be out anytime near that timeframe.  Hopefully they'll make some markets on those too.

Re gaming markets: my favorite example is the 2012 Obama Romney election market on Intrade.  The Romney campaign / friends (allegedly) bought a bunch of shares of Romney, but the market pretty quickly corrected back to prior odds.

The reason we're currently using eth is entirely due to practical reasons:

Differing ideas on the consensus mechanism and a few other implementation details.  We came to Paul quite a few months back and offered to join forces.  He doesn't like that we utilize Ethereum (which we chose because it allows us to iterate super quickly).  We're a fan of allowing people to use stablecoins instead of just CFDs for stable wagers, which means in 5 years when merge mined sidechains are released (Greg Maxwell's estimate) we can just add them in, but still have a viable platform in the meantime.  
Our alpha demos available here if you wanna check it out:

Funds aren't really held in escrow in this sort of system since you can sell at any time (since it's a prediction market and not parimutuel betting)
@_date: 2015-06-17 03:33:01
Ethereum exists, I can run my code on it and it works.  This alpha runs on the Ethereum network.  Sidechains exist, they just released a working prototype last week.  
@_date: 2015-06-29 23:35:11
Yep + add the benefits of uncensorability + no central custody of funds + a truly global market and you have something really awesome!  
In response to OP, more generally, prediction markets are a good "information aggregation" tool.  There's a sea of information, and markets take as much of that as possible and provide a finite price estimate of the likelihood of an event.  
@_date: 2015-06-24 16:32:03
No... anyone in the community can discuss it.  However, this variable isn't really that significant.  Event outcomes don't need to be resolved super often because this is only as a forceful incentive to ensure that markets autoresolve most the time.
Second, if you make a branch for different subjects, _you_ can choose the period length.  So if you consider each and every person TPTB, then I guess..
@_date: 2015-06-28 18:23:23
So 1) I own no (and have never owned nor have any intentions of ever owning) ether
2) By boost for Eth I mean it supports my argument that building on ethereum was a good decision if sidechains won't be implemented in Bitcoin's core repo for years. And this makes ethereum's delays not look too bad compared to the sidechains timeline. 
My motives are clear and open, what are yours?
Think I'm wrong on either claim? Let's bet on it - I'll be on fairlay ;) - 
What better way to settle this than a prediction market :)
@_date: 2015-06-04 19:22:16
Firstly, federated sidechains are already doable on Bitcoin right now.  And second, we're not dependent on sidechains, but some form of decentralized exchange (like cross chain atomic tx, which have already been implemented in mercuryex).  Sidechains, however, would be ideal to allow us to use bitcoin on our platform which (atleast I) view as the cryptocurrency that will be used for payments across blockchains.
@_date: 2015-06-23 18:43:43
We use different consensus algorithms, utilize Ethereum (because it allows us to iterate super quickly, e.g. our alpha is already out with a demo here: demo.augur.net). We're currency agnostic, and want to allow people to use stablecoins instead of just CFDs for stable wagers, which means in 5 years when merge mined sidechains are released (Greg Maxwell's estimate) we can just add them in, but still have a viable platform in the meantime.
Re consensus algorithms, there's lots of simple cases where the original Truthcoin PCA/SVD algo simply doesn't work (nor does the variant of PCA we made called "big-five").  We'll have a blog post out soon going over all the evidence and monte carlos we've done on both the old algorithms and our new one, as well as the tests here  which our algorithm does better as well (e.g. proper rep redistribution).  It's also significantly cheaper to compute, which is nice.

There will be a beta with blockchain.info style wallets available (although you can always use a full node if you like) in late Summer.

Q&amp;A of SF Bitcoin Devs sidechain elements talk (someone asked when it'd be merged into Bitcoin core --- I suppose this is an important distinction, e.g. two way pegs will be implemented in testnets/private chains long before then, but it'll take a long time for community to come to consensus on them.  See blocksize debate since 2013.).  
As far as using Eth, would prefer to have something now, even if it means using a stablecoin vs waiting for sidechains which we can always integrate later.  Only way to do augurs bonded reputation system without rep is to assume access to infinite capital, which works nice in Econ assumptions, but not in practice

So bookmakers set the odds --- this system allows the market to set the odds of events.  Another cool thing is that anyone can create markets on whatever they please on this system.  It's uncensorable with no central custody/control of funds.  When a market sets the odds (see:  it provides much better info on real life events and corresponding forecasts for them.  
@_date: 2015-06-24 00:28:11
Uncensorable + distributed, no central control of funds (held in a smart contract), market payout mechanism is distributed amongst nodes as well.
@_date: 2015-06-23 22:05:10
Unfortunately it's not possible to implement this (without using an m of n oracle system instead of a distributed one) on Bitcoin directly.  There is an implementation on a _fork_ of Bitcoin called Truthcoin.  However both our project and that one require the use of a sidechain to use Bitcoin itself on the platform.  
@_date: 2015-06-24 04:12:01
Yeah can be variable, we'll see how well it really works with further testing and change if needed.

So we have two classes: 1) reputation used to weight reports which are used to determine outcomes and 2) the currencies used to wager on markets.  When you sequester your bitcoin no traditional exchange would take place you'd just have "x augur sidechain bitcoin" which you could use in markets.  Then when you're done you can destroy your "x augur sidechain bitcoin" and claim regular bitcoin back on bitcoin's chain.
@_date: 2015-06-02 19:28:17
Yes it will be possible to use Bitcoin (provided the guys at Blockstream execute, and I think they will).  Currently, since we're in alpha testing, it's just play money :)
@_date: 2015-06-27 20:58:13
The idea is you get people on the system with more popular markets (like elections), which can make the system have more users &amp; be more liquid for more obscure markets.  Of course, there's a chance people will just use the popular markets and not pay attention to more obscure ones.
@_date: 2015-06-17 03:41:42
I think he means as a use case for the average joe.  The average American isn't really interested in holding crypto (e.g. Bitcoin) as an investment.  Although _I_ am, it doesn't mean _most_ people are..
Prediction markets, which include every type of financial market as a subset of them, and allow people to wager on essentially _anything_ globally for the first time without censorship are extremely powerful.  
I predict in a few years the overwhelming majority of our users _won't_ even _know_ they're using Ethereum at all.  
Just because one uses the term "bitcoin maximalist" doesn't make them a disliker of bitcoin.  I myself would be considered a "bitcoin maximalist" (since I think Bitcoin will be the primary currency used across blockchains).  Others don't, but since we'll allow people to create markets on Augur in whatever currency they want, the market will decide.
@_date: 2015-06-24 16:44:49
There'll be a mobile app (or at least an HTML5 app similar to the way blockchain.info handles wallets)
@_date: 2015-06-02 20:00:21
The counterparty version doesn't allow you to use Bitcoin in contracts, nor does it allow you to store more than an op return's (or a fancy multisig's) worth of data per tx/block.  For us that means our contracts just wouldn't work in practice on the Counterparty version.  
Their implementation is also 4 version increments behind eth's now, so I'm not sure if our code would even run on it.  If it did run, you'd be both bloating the Bitcoin blockchain and spending a lot more money to run transactions.  For example, for a simple transaction like creating a market, it'd take you 2 bitcoin blocks worth to get that done (so at a minimum 20 min. for something that should really take a user less than 30 seconds).  
@_date: 2015-06-23 21:31:45
Because it wouldn't make the incorrect call... The result was decided December 12th: 
So, let's say it expired in the period ending Nov. 30, now people would report .5 because they don't know what happened, then it'd get pushed back to the next period 2 months later and people would report that Bush won.. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 22:00:57
For both it provides better odds estimates of future events.  Knowing more about the future can help you make better decisions.  If you google Robin Hanson idea futures or Robin Hanson futarchy you'll see some great examples
@_date: 2015-06-29 23:43:00
Even the stock market is sometimes good at predicting outside events (e.g. after Challenger o-ring issue, the stock that fell the most was the company that manufactured the o-rings, even though the US gov't didn't officially announce for months).  
The great thing that markets add is the incentive that if you know or think you know more than the market then you can easily profit off the herd.  The thing about experts is individually (and when they don't have financial incentive) they tend to be horribly wrong.  Add a directly proportional financial incentive + a bunch of experts participating in the market and you get pretty accurate estimates (or at least historically prediction markets have fared well, see UK election, US elections, etc.)
@_date: 2015-06-23 21:08:46
Transactions are irreversible but that doesn't mean they can't modify state.  So let's say you have one reporting period and the question is Bush Gore presidency --- you're not sure yet, so you report .5.  It gets automatically pushed back once to report on in the next period (at least this is how I implemented things).  The election has now been decided, you report Bush.
That's true anyone can fact check intrade, but they had no recourse when Intrade did the payouts wrong, complaining didn't work, intrade stuck w/ their call

Well Maxwell himself said that in the Q&amp;A at SF Bitcoin Devs Sidechains elements meetup (if that's not what he actually meant, then I'll quit repeating the claim) --- I was discussing this with people afterwards who also heard the same thing and was pretty shocked myself (because Back had told me they'd be implemented within a year back in Oct.).  I think Maxwell's point was --- they may implement code for 2-way pegs fairly quickly, but Bitcoin consensus / politics will take a long time to get them merged.  
As far as an "appcoin" --- the only way to do augur's bonded reputation system without rep is to assume people have access to infinite capital, which works nice in Econ assumptions, but not in practice / real world (where it'd open a ton of attack vectors due to this).  This is part of the reason why "Schellingcoin" (which follows the approach Maxwell implies he'd take, no "appcoin") is less incentive compatible than this (and why Vitalik calls augur a "souped-up schellingcoin.") 
Additionally, rep's value would be equal to future cash flow from trading fees - discount for time value of money.  Has much nicer + key important properties we need for a system like this that providing a traditional bond doesn't.
More importantly, you don't need rep to wager in or create markets (and you can't use it to do so even if you wanted) --- it's not an actual altcoin, you can't even trade it a decent amount of the time due to reporting requirements &amp; you lose it if you don't use it to report.
@_date: 2015-06-24 16:29:41
I was asked if a similar project exists on Bitcoin (in this case, it's on a fork of btc), not our origin story.  Paul claims we're not a "true" implementation of truthcoin because we're "too different" (presumably because Eth &amp; a new consensus algo).  Can't have it both ways!
Truthcoin has a place top right on the front of our website as the underlying theory / core ideas for our project though, and always has :).

The UK election prediction markets were actually predicting the opposite of most polls, and the PMs ended up being right.  
Agree that wisdom of crowds isn't the most applicable aspect that results in PM success though, would say it's probably information asymmetry.

Hey everyone, I'm working on this project, and we don't replace ethereum.  Ethereum has a turing complete language for all sorts of smart contracts (but it doesn't do super well with external/outside world data - known as the oracle problem).  What we're doing is creating a new consensus mechanism to solve this oracle issue, via massively distributed, decentralized voting.  
Which in turn, works quite well for replacing prediction market judges with a decentralized system.  
Decentralized prediction markets are superior to centralized ones for a few reasons: one, the judge can never cheat and claim an incorrect outcome, and two, they can't be shutdown (unlike intrade and every other centralized prediction market).  One of the websites using bitcoin for PMs but judging the outcome is still centralized, and they will be shutdown over time.  There's also no risk of someone running away with your money in a decentralized prediction market.
Trusted oracles exist already, orisi and codius are a few, however the problem is that they are trusted.  If you trust a judge there's no reason he can't collude with a few other judges or claim an incorrect outcome to gain a lot of money.  Even if he has reputation, when he retires, he can still cheat for his last big payday.  Whereas, if you have a decentralized voting system with encrypted votes, this cannot happen, and the system stays secure.  Another downside to trusted oracles is that they could be shutdown quite easily: it's much harder to shutdown a decentralized network of thousands of nodes.

Hey arcrad, it's actually really not!  You need to collect all the unspent outputs into something in which you can store them with significantly less than 25+GB of data for it to actually constitute a snapshot.  The 20 cents part can be modified to be whatever you want, in fact, you could include all 49 million addresses --- our reference / demo implementation simply used 20 cents as the demarcator.  This is easily changed by simply changing one number in the system.

It uses a technique of digital signal processing called frequency shift keying in which the bitcoin transaction request is transmitted through frequency changes of a carrier wave (which is around 14 Khz).  We just alternate the frequency between two values to denote a 0 and 1.
As for encryption, it wouldn't be difficult to do, however since all we're doing is requesting a payment it's akin to just passing around your bitcoin address. So if someone stole the data all they could do is send you money :D

This is ironic considering your diatribes against proof of stake (making the same lack of public evidence argument).

Using something like lightning.network that might be possible, but we wouldn't be able to have a distributed oracle system like we want.  Some parts of our system really should be run on chain, and that part is one of the most important (and also unfortunately, the most expensive &amp; mission critical).  
Besides the fact that 40 byte op returns are too small to store all this data, I'd argue that instead of building


one should instead strive to build something that uses Bitcoin, but doesn't add bloat to the chain.  IMO interoperable chains &gt; putting all the onus on bitcoin

As opposed to... implementing a bunch of transactions on a not-built-for-it scripting language, feeling good about your security model because it's "built on Bitcoin" even though you've drastically changed almost everything, and then sidechaining it and spending an order of magnitude more development time.
Or... you could use Eth, implement at a much faster iterative speed, _and_ still sidechain to Bitcoin.
If that's cold water it feels extremely refreshing!

Checkout the long discussions on p+epsilon attacks on both Vitalik's blog and Truthcoin's forum. To be able to credibly commit to a p+e attack in this system you have to prove you have enough money as whatever 65% of rep is (that's the consensus cutoff, not a simple majority). A p+e attack on something like proof of work, however, doesn't have this requirement and is thus easier to credibly commit to.

Ethereum doesn't use proof of stake at the moment.  It uses a hashing algorithm.  They'll only switch to proof of stake if someone creates a working sound implementation (which hasn't been done).
Even if they did, it's not like ethereum will be the only smart contracting platform in a few years anyway.  If someone comes up with a better one that simply merge mines with Bitcoin using sidechains, our contracts will be able to run on that with minimal modification.
The benefit of using a language like serpent is that it's a very readable language, which makes it easy to port if ever needed.

Well your white paper still mentions vanilla LMSR. 
It more accurately detects deviations from the correct result. I can post results showing it blowing the 1st component only algo out of the water if you like. Almost invariably it results in less reputation going to liars and a higher detection rate

Transparency, open source community benefits?  
If you publish your tests, I can run both the 5 component and the original one component algorithm on them. If you're right your one component algorithm should fare better. You could then (rightfully) claim that you were right and we were stupid for modifying your algo, unless of course you're worried the results might not come out that way. 
If you had public test data this boring conversation would've never happened (because we could've ran tests and (supposedly) seen the superiority of the 1 component algo).

It's not a problem of having a secure distributed database that can store a lot of data (although that is one problem). It's a problem of not being able to do secure computations on Bitcoin due to a limited scripting engine. The only way this could be folded into Bitcoin is either a) using a centralized oracle system or b) getting the core devs to add new transaction types just for this. 
You could implement it as a sidechained implementation of Bitcoin, however. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 02:04:44

@_date: 2015-05-21 03:23:17


The schelling point is .5/ambiguous/indeterminate/bad question, which is a reporting option.  You're not required to choose yes / no.


As in just take a simple majority?  Why do that when you can calculate covariance among reports and dock people who are obviously going against consensus?
The edges (very contentious decisions) are where you require the most amount of rep/money to credibly bribe people, because if you end up failing you won't be able to payout due to the vast amount of rep lost.


This is a good idea, will start work on this for the beta release so we can get concrete evidence.  The real test will be between plain stake voting &amp; schelling consensus, m-of-n would be inconclusive as it's not really vulnerable until you get to large amounts of money (although, it has failed a few times in practice, see Intrade doing wrong payouts a few times) and that's not even with malintent. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 22:21:07

This is generally correct.
However, you can have prediction markets on what should happen.  These are called futarchy markets --- a good explanation is available here  and   Futarchy markets require a subsidy though, and they're a bit different than most markets.
@_date: 2015-05-21 06:44:32


Official results had not come in, which is why an event on this should be made to expire a bit after its traditional date.  If it's still uncertain, you report indeterminate and report on it again later.


Coinbase, btc-e would work.  


Except, you wouldn't be arguing _when_.  If the event expired before MtGox went down and ceased to provide a price, you would report the price at time of expiration.  If the event expired _after_ MtGox went down, you would report indeterminate.  "What is the price provided by MtGox?" expiring on Dec. 31 2013 would have been reported; it's really quite clear _and_ easy.


This is true, so if something is phrased poorly or too imprecise it will be reported as ambiguous.  Our oracles won't be in the business of interpretation.  If it isn't factual, it isn't resolvable.

Edit: nvm, found them here 
@_date: 2016-06-21 19:07:29
They have, sort of.  While ML is used in many trading algos, most don't do it on 100% encrypted data where you don't even know what you're predicting on.  This sort of shifts it into a pure data science problem.  And of course no hedge funds [that i know of] will pay for anonymous predictions [where they don't even have the source code of the algo], i.e. anyone can provide predictions to Numerai and earn bitcoin from doing so.
@_date: 2016-01-17 00:11:44


He also caused a whole host of problems with his XT spinoff in August/sept. re price.  At least community seems to be finding consensus on Bitcoin Classic.

@_date: 2016-06-21 19:40:31
Yeah it has an algo which uses an aggregate of the predictions from the best algos.  If you go to numer.ai the algos are sorted by accuracy and the best ones have higher weightings.  Algos that have "unique" trades also get a bit of a bonus

I know profitability has improved as the number of tournaments have increased / gone on, and it's beating some well known hedge fund indices, but that's about all i can say [i'm an advisor].
And yes I think it is very sci-fi, also one of the first cool uses of homomorphic encryption imo!
@_date: 2016-06-21 20:30:10


Not only are the providers blinded, the data they're providing _and_ analyzing is blinded as well, in other words as a predictor you get blinded data, run computations on it, the output is encrypted as well, and your identity is blinded too.  I'd still say it's fairly different, most alpha capture systems [again that i'm aware of] aren't solely the output of ML classification algos [now one could argue this is worse _or_ better, Numerai obviously thinks it's better, but we'll have to see!]
@_date: 2016-06-21 19:04:55
It's not soliciting donations.  It's _paying_ people money for their predictions.  The predictions are only as good as the algorithms that submit them

@_date: 2016-06-21 19:44:44
Yeah, so that's if you're making a bunch of money from providing trading predictions and want to hedge a bit against malevolent strong AI ;)
No user of this is going to be "unsophisticated" in the sense that they don't know how to make a decision whether to make a donation or not / how much.  The users are all ML programmers / data scientists.
It's also one of the first few uses of homomorphic encryption in practice, which is pretty cool.  MIRI is a research institute for AI based in the Bay Area, no donations would go to numerai..
@_date: 2016-06-21 21:57:58
So what homomorphic encryption allows is for running computations on encrypted data.  So basically numerai can post a bunch of stock data, people can run it through binary classifiers in a kaggle style contest, then they submit their predictions back to numerai and numerai can decrypt them.  So since you're classifying things in a binary fashion, they can take what you classified, decrypt it, and use it to trade
@_date: 2016-06-21 20:15:29


All the payouts are available at numer.ai
The fund doesn't have very much AUM atm, once it scales payouts would proportionately get bigger.
@_date: 2016-06-21 20:14:32
Last I checked alpha capture systems weren't on homomorphically encrypted data and used pdf style reports with an audit trail to the producer of the report, not solely quantitative binary classification on encrypted data:  but I'm sure you already knew that, right?
[For anyone else interested:  and  should make clear the difference here]
@_date: 2016-06-21 20:26:17
Hehehe you can't send your money ;), fund isn't open for external public investment atm
@_date: 2016-06-21 20:52:03
Good question hehe.
So basically the way it works is
- People write machine learning algorithms
- They download data from numer.ai's site
- They run their algos on that homomorphically encrypted data
- They submit the predictions to numer.ai's site
- Numer.ai goes long on the best predictions and pays out the best predictors proportionately
The more money numerai makes, the more money predictors make.  So the anonymous predictors aren't actually going long, they're just being paid for their predictions.  Numerai itself is the one going long
@_date: 2016-06-21 20:46:28
It'd be a red flag if I hadn't looked into MIRI before.  I didn't post this b/c i wanted people to send MIRI bitcoin, I posted it b/c I think numer.ai is cool.  If you write a classifier algo and submit some predictions and get $20k out of it, would always be a nice gesture to send a couple hundred bucks to the Machine Intelligence Research Institute so they can do more research on AI [ Eliezer Yudkowsky heads it up, he's not a scammer, he's a well respected AI researcher].
_But_ it's not a requirement to participate in numer.ai, it's just something one can do if they're a bit of an AI fanatic ;)
The "Using Bitcoin" part of the post meant you get rewarded in bitcoin for providing good predictions, not as a call to action to send MIRI money.  That said, looks like 2 people did, so I'm sure MIRI is quite appreciative!

Only if you want to run a full node, but starting in our beta we'll have blockchain.info style Augur wallets.


It uses eth for the backend smart contracts (which means it accepts ether and stablecoins, and once sidechains come out we'll be able to use Bitcoin as well).  The UI is in javascript - react/flux.


Basically just an ecdsa key - so an ethereum wallet if you want a full node, or an augur blockchain.info style wallet once we launch that. 


Yep, exactly
@_date: 2015-08-03 18:28:51


So you could use bitcoin's source code, but it wouldn't actually be using real Bitcoin (unless you sidechained it up, which is what we plan to do anyway).  As for rep, there is a way to do it with bonded bitcoin (see schellingcoin idea) but it's not as secure since people can alternate how much they bond at anytime to skew events much easier than with a reputation system.  Schellingcoin was Vitalik Buterin's idea; he views this as a "souped-up schellingcoin."


So basically it's a security measure.  Once you submit a report it's locked in so you can't submit an invalid report, send the rep to an address that reported correctly, and then essentially you cheated the system and didn't get penalized.  
Rep isn't mined it's just redistributed over time to people who report from people who slack off on reporting
@_date: 2015-08-11 23:23:13
Bitcoin, ether exchanges and purchase points. With enough money there's hardly ever a true way to get completely around it. 
"Our software" doesn't store your information - it's open source, run client side and on ethereum, and doesn't store any info about our users. But since these contracts deal with real money, there are both entry and exit points. Buying the crypto and selling it. 
Near the end is a good commentary on possible regulation of decentralized prediction markets
@_date: 2015-08-03 22:09:49


Alright, I'll concede our system isn't secure against "kill your daughter" attacks - then again, neither is anything else (unless you're just a cruel greedy jerk who doesn't mind your daughter dying).


Then it's not credible collusion.  I can say "Hey, let's report that McCain won the election!" but there's no reason I'm going to follow through on it.  In fact, your EV would be higher if you told me "Yeah, good idea, I'll do that too" and then not follow through.  The only scenario the above collusion works is if people just trust and believe everything everyone else says without proof (in which case we wouldn't need an oracle system at all) or the cheaters are honest amongst each other and don't turn each other in (doubtful, since in practice this rarely happens).
So a commit and reveal is pretty simple:
1) take your report, append a random salt, hash it, submit hash to network
2) reports are locked in
3) submit your plaintext report and salt
 3a) if they don't match up, it counts as if you didn't report at all
 3b) if you proved to me you reported a certain way i provide the network your salt and report and in turn i get all your reputation


Now this is a more substantial point as it would be easier to get a majority on smaller subject categories, so people should only put high value markets on the main group.  There is another way to scale, however, which is by having people be randomly selected to report on a subset of events/markets.
@_date: 2015-08-03 19:18:46
Rep isn't actually used (and isn't able to be used) in the markets in our system. That'd be stable coins, ether, and Bitcoin once sidechains are beyond alpha. We're not launching a real money live augur for quite a few months
@_date: 2015-08-03 18:06:53
Hey Storm,
So I wouldn't really think of rep as an altcoin.  Heck, you can't even trade it a decent amount of the time (due to the way the system works w/ reporting).  Augur is a prediction market platform and we need a way to coordinate payouts in a decentralized fashion.  Long story short, we have people report on what actually happened after the fact (since smart contracts can't just make api calls).
To prevent sybil attacks we needed a way to weight reports.  We weight them by rep.  If you own rep, you receive trading fees in proportion to the rep you own.  If you disagree with the consensus you lose rep (and correspondingly you'll get less trading fees).
Since each rep has value (the future EV of trading fees in the system - so 1 rep has 1/11 millionth of the fees) then if you lose rep you're losing something of value.  And why is that important?  Because our security model relies upon rep being valuable, as opposed to something you can get for free, which is why we're selling it in an auction.
@_date: 2015-08-11 23:48:11
I don't think you're really reading what I'm saying. Sure you have coins, you can spend them on augur if you like. We don't record anything and no one can "control" you. Our software doesn't take any of your physicial or identifying information.  We are _not_ an entry or exit point, so using our platform in of itself doesn't make you vulnerable. 
However, if you withdraw your bitcoin to an exchange you can be identified. If you buy your Bitcoin with fiat at an exchange... you can be identified. That's all I'm saying.  It seems to have been misconstrued as "if you use augur you're identifiable" which is no more or less true than using Bitcoin (it's all pseudonymous addresses).  But with augur just as with Bitcoin, depending on how you get into and out of crypto, you can possibly be identified. 
TLDR our platform doesn't link people to addresses, but depending on how people get or exit from crypto, they could be identified. It (identification) doesn't have much to do with us though, but places where people buy and sell Bitcoin 
@_date: 2015-08-03 19:17:03
I wasn't referring to these comments Taek but other ones.  But I still haven't seen any core critiques here besides "you use ethereum." which I've responded to probably around 100 times and is a pretty dead badly beaten horse since Bitcoin sidechains on eth vs on Bitcoin source code are both doable. There's the other critique of the freeloader problem, and there is a way to prevent that on ethereum as well. But both ethereum and Bitcoin and any smart contract system are vulnerable to it through zero knowledge proofs. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 17:55:52

I commented on that post about "no Ethereum posts" explaining how Ethereum plans to use sidechains once they come out.  I argued that currently sidechain discussion is allowed as well as other projects that plan to use sidechains.  As well as any other thing that accepts Bitcoin is allowed to be discussed on this subreddit.  Then why not ethereum (since with sidechains you will be able to directly use bitcoin on it)?  Others made these arguments as well and the OP that said "no Ethereum posts" actually ended up getting deleted.

P.S. We're no longer implementing the Truthcoin protocol. We use some of the same core ideas (just as schellingcoin does), but due to some incontrovertible flaws with the original consensus algorithm we're not using that.


You gave us advice for a handful of hours and most the time refused to discuss things with us.  Unfortunately, it wasn't much help due to the latter.


You were offered a promotional role as "Chief Truthcoin Officer" but as we can see now that would have been a bad idea as you quite frequently personally attack people, refuse to discuss actual tech, and make blanket statements without evidence.

Comment I made on the article: 
A few things:
"By the Autumn of 2014, Dyffy had been renamed to Pythia, and Sztorc was able to introduce the young startup to some potential investors. Sztorc describes the negative reaction from these investors on the Truthcoin GitHub:" - We never renamed to Pythia, it was one of the names we were considering before Augur. The only investor we ever pitched to was Tim Draper, prior to realizing that the only proper way to distribute rep would be a crowdsale as opposed to giving 20-30% to a VC and then more in further rounds a la Ripple (which kinda defeats the purpose of a distributed oracle system). We've had lots of investor interest on a for-profit value added services company for Augur (i.e 1-2 emails a week from investors) but haven't officially launched anything yet, but this is substantially after the time period referred to above.
"By this I mean that they have been thinking and wondering about answers to important questions for months." - I'm not sure what this is referring to, but for my thoughts on the most important question, i.e. how do you do decentralized consensus on events see: 
One thing I forgot to mention in my response to this: "it is trivial to build ‘parasite contracts’ which steal the labor done by Truthcoin's Voters without paying for it." - it is possible to make it so contracts cannot do this (contracts cannot read block storage on other contracts without permission, so all we have to do is limit the permission to certain whitelisted augur contracts for certain functions).
People could still get the data personally and prove to themselves that it was x, just not to other contracts (i.e. solving the leeching problem temporarily). I say temporarily because as I'm quoted above, with zero knowledge proofs, you can build a parasite contract for pretty much anything (otoh, you wouldn't really even need reporting consensus with cheap zk proofs, because you could prove on chain you made a certain api call to a reputable source and got result x, which could then be used to resolve an outcome).
@_date: 2015-08-03 18:29:41
Thank you!
And yes definitely.  We want to have quite a few professionals audit our security as well as do months of testing with the final version before launching with live money
@_date: 2015-08-03 18:44:03
With eth - you can't directly vote to implement new code within a contract, but you can vote to update a contract address.  So our getters and setters are abstracted out, those contracts are essentially unchangeable, but all the other logic would be (as well as the ability to add new getters/setters) changeable.  It just requires the addition of a few functions and a data structure to store all the addresses.  
@_date: 2015-07-16 18:58:18




So the way a bribe would work is you have to credibly commit to pay if the bribe fails.  This would be p (the amount the user stands to lose by reporting dishonestly) + some epsilon that would reward them more than just reporting honestly.  Now to commit credibly the worst case loss for a reporter you need to be able to commit a value p equivalent to all of their reputation score + some epsilon.  Let's assume epsilon is small and just disregard it to make things simple.  At a case with high contention (i.e. 51% vs 49%) the 49% group loses almost all of its score.  So to commit credibly in case the bribe didn't actually succeed, you'd have to commit to ~49% of the reputation in a system, practically, a 51% attack.
If you could do this with only 500k, it'd work.  But since rep would be valued at future cash flow from trading fees discounted for time value of money, it'd likely cost much more than 500k.
If this is unclear, I've pasted Vitalik's comments on the subject below as well which has a slightly different wording.

Oh, I see what you're saying.  In my discussion above I'm assuming that betting in the PM (in this attack) doesn't really have any value (like you seem to be doing) but what adds the massive value is bribing the oracles.  What I'm saying is the money you'd have to prove you have to bribe them / theoretically spend on the bribe would be more than the money you could win from the PM _even if_ you successfully bribed them since you'd have to prove you have ~49% of the value of all rep.  The only way this works is if there is only one successful market with lots of liquidity and no other markets that are successful at all, which would make the cost to buy ~49% of rep cheap enough to make it in your incentive to just bribe the oracles (if the market you were trying to cheat had enough money in it).  Either way when bribing, you still have to bet in the actual market though (the oracles don't control funds, to bribe someone to send you funds you'd have to bribe the actual network &amp; miners, not the oracles).  The oracles just determine the outcome of the event.
@_date: 2015-07-30 20:07:58
Well right now it doesn't since they're [sidechains] not out yet.  But once they're out you could setup a federated peg to send bitcoin between ethereum and the bitcoin network (this could be done now with the test implementation to send testnet bitcoin coins around on ethereum - it was something I wanted to implement but I've been busy with other things, I think Joseph Chow @ Ethereum is working on this now).  
A two-way peg is a bit harder: your options are (since bitcoin can't process sha3 hashes) fork eth and switch out the mining algo to merge mine w/ bitcoin and setup a two way peg that way _or_ setup an intermediary sidechain.  
The way an intermediary chain would work is you create one chain pegged to bitcoin, make it so it accepts sha3 spv proofs, then you'd have to use it as an intermediary.  This seems incredibly inconvenient, but I don't think it's as big a deal as it seems because decentralized exchanges (a la tiernolan's proposal) will be primarily used to send coins across chains anyway (this is touched on in one of the appendices of the sidechains white paper).  
Sidechains are useful to make it possible to use "real" Bitcoin on other chains, but I suspect in the long run (since sidechains take upwards of 10-12 hours to confirm a transaction, or 20-24 hours in this intermediary case) there will be market makers who essentially transfer big chunks of Bitcoin across chains.  
The average user would then simply buy these sidechained Bitcoin from a decentralized exchange (that way they don't have to wait long to get their sidechained Bitcoin).  If you have some huge sum of money, you could obviously transfer back to Bitcoin via the sidechain and then withdraw to a centralized exchange to convert back to say USD.

The risk of the central location of funds being stolen, lost, hacked etc. (in addition to cftc issues, intrade was practically insolvent due to the CEO's siphoning of company funds).  If I make a centralized bitcoin PM you have to trust me to not walk off with your funds.


Intrades done this a few times, each time they ended up doing payouts too soon.  A decentralized system can report indeterminate, push back to next batch of reporting (i.e. reporting period) and determine the outcome.


Well, for one, a decentralized PM also means the first truly global PM (i.e. betfair isn't a global market, and nor was intrade), which means more liquidity.
Another benefit of decentralizing is that the market can decide what markets it wants to make (since anyone can create a market).  
If there were a global PM with no counterparty risk and the ability to create your own markets, well, I wouldn't be building augur.

So you've confused the idea of _building on a fork of Bitcoin_ with _using Bitcoin as a sidechain_.
Which are two completely different things.  I have always stated we want to be sidechained to Bitcoin (heck, if you can find a statement contrary I'll give you a Bitcoin).  I've also been quite consistent in that I think building on a fork of Bitcoin is a bad idea.  But I think running as a sidechain is a _great_ idea.
TLDR: I care about accepting Bitcoin as a currency in our system; its codebase? Not so much.
Edit: My comment in the thread you quoted from actually perfectly sums it up: "Sidechains and Ethereum aren't mutually exclusive."
Or, checkout the post I linked you to above and scroll down to the "Why not a fork of Bitcoin?" section where you can see quite clearly that I'm a fan of accepting Bitcoin via a sidechain, just not using its codebase (i've also stated this repeatedly in my comments on reddit)
@_date: 2015-08-11 22:03:12
Yep (unless you convert it via decentralized exchange to a stablecoin - which isn't as hard as it sounds, basically just sending Bitcoin to a specific address, but that isn't the same)--- it is (rather, it'll probably just be implemented in a contract on ethereum and other contracts will interface with that contract)
@_date: 2015-07-16 17:03:34


There's significant financial stake in making the oracle system lie without it being used as an oracle system for other contracts...  That's what the entire point of a reputation weighted distributed oracle system is, to provide a huge financial incentive not to lie.  Your statement is orthogonal.  


No more simple than a 51% attack on any distributed consensus system. [referring to the oracle system here].  
Making a "market lie" is completely different than fudging the outcomes, for an example of this, look at the intrade romney obama market for a few hours in the 2012 election when romney's campaign bought some shares.  


I have, but you haven't paid attention.  There's a few ways: 1) if threshold sigs ever become easier to compute you can use rep weighted federated pegs, 2) you can merge mine.
There are two ways to do a merge mined sidechain with Augur
2a) swap out eth's sha3 mining algo w/ bitcoin's - merge mine
2b) create an intermediary sidechain that accepts sha3 proofs, merge mine with bitcoin
2b) seems like a horrible clunky solution, but it's not too bad since most sidechain coins will be traded thru decentralized exchanges: the sidechain just gives them the value on the decentralized exchange.  I.e. look at the time to transfer coins across chains and read the appendices of the sidechains paper.  


And... you've misconstrued making changes to state as being mutable.  Making changes to bitcoin (i.e. spending unspent outputs) doesn't make the past any more mutable than making changes to the state of a contract on eth makes the history fudgable.  


I _am_ a bitcoiner --- I want to build it using a sidechain because I think bitcoin will become the currency used across chains.


Please point out the flaws incontrovertible with sidechains working in:
"2a) swap out eth's sha3 mining algo w/ bitcoin's - merge mine
2b) create an intermediary sidechain that accepts sha3 proofs, merge mine with bitcoin"
TLDR: If you don't believe me, I'll *bet* you 10 bitcoin that Augur will be able to accept sidechained bitcoin within a year of the soft fork being implemented.
@_date: 2015-07-30 19:38:11
I wrote something that allows you to do exactly this, but I don't see any reason to use it when you can just use sidechains once they come out.
@_date: 2015-07-17 14:48:15
So you can do that, but you have no financial benefit in doing so if you don't bet in the market too (i.e. people who want to watch the world burn / Byzantines can throw money at a system to try to attack it, can't argue with that, just arguing that it's prohibitively expensive and if you don't bet in the corresponding market can't even have a positive EV).  I suppose there is a rare unlikely incentive beyond a financial benefit, which is that augur gets so popular and you're rich enough to try to attack it to try to fudge history / reality, but that's a bit abstract. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 16:57:12

@_date: 2015-07-16 02:34:18


People don't seem to have fully realized yet that you can use bitcoin on other chains, including chains that aren't just forks of bitcoin. 
We've also modified the consensus algo per:  but the idea of penalizing reporters who disagree w/ the consensus is still the same.  I'd say we're about as similar to truthcoin as bitcoin is to hashcash at this point due to the changes we've made (some of them including: liquidity sensitive msr by default, clustering instead of pca, and of course, the architectural decision to build using eth).

@_date: 2015-07-16 02:29:28


This is incorrect.  I have _always_ stated that we plan to be a Bitcoin sidechain _once_ sidechains are _out_.  
Our codebase just isn't a fork of Bitcoin, which I still maintain doesn't allow as rapid development as turing complete script.  Heck, I don't even own any ether, while over 90% of my money is in btc --- I just think it's a better way to develop the platform since it can't be built on true bitcoin core either way (it has to be a fork):

My presumption is that the financial gain would result from say betting on something with very low likelihood (say 5%) and then bribing the oracles to fudge the result, giving you a very high payout (20x).


More profitable in what sense?  I don't follow what you mean by "it's more profitable to bribe the oracles" --- more profitable _than_ what?
@_date: 2015-07-16 17:14:10
I lol'd.  Read the history of prediction markets and you'll see a lot of good reasons to decentralize them (namely, central party risk, wrong outcome payouts, regulatory issues, etc.).  Second, no PM anymore use MSRs, which makes their usefulness at low liquidity not very high.
@_date: 2015-07-16 02:55:43


This is also true.  One of the coolest parts about augur is it can function as an oracle system for all the other contracts on Eth --- _while at the same time still accepting Bitcoin_.  Building on a fork of Bitcoin, you do essentially destroy this awesome part of the system
@_date: 2015-07-17 15:46:51
So your attack relies upon making a separate bet somewhere else, using our oracle system to decide an outcome, and using that outcome to payout your separate bet (which you gain from by bribing the oracles).  There's an easy way to avoid this attack, which is, don't make any external bets using our oracle system which have an expected payout on either outcome higher than half the value of all reputation. If I saw a contract that did some outside bet like this, I'd be very cautious and probably not use it due to the security risk you point out.  No cryptoeconomic system is fault tolerant when you throw enough money at it, ours is no different.  I do maintain its fault tolerant up to the parameters I've discussed above, i.e you require that much money to bribe it.

It's unfortunate that Paul has resorted to personal attacks on our team that has worked night and day for nearly a year to deliver on the promise of decentralized prediction markets.

We'd be betting on whether ethereum has a consensus failure (in say its first year of operation). 
Thank you. It's set for mid-June. The main advantage to purchasing ahead of time would be that if you buy in the first few days you'll get a 10% discount compared to buyers who bought in later in the sale.  We're selling a limited amount of reputation (all at once) and letting the market value it. Price = money in sale / total rep. 
Of course, if the market value of reputation (used to weight reports on event outcomes to prevent Sybil attacks, and you're rewarded with part of the trading fees in proportion to how much reputation you have) falls &gt;10% between crowd sale and live money launch you'd be better off buying on an exchange after. 
If the market values it higher as we continue testing and gain momentum in both our alpha (starting in about two weeks) and beta (over the summer) then perhaps the value in exchanges would be higher at launch, in which case you were better off buying in the sale.
After we release our alpha implementation (the code is there &amp; runs, but still hooking up the UI to it) I think most people watching from the sidelines will be able to comfortably make a decision whether they want to buy in in the sale or wait until after exchanges have it.

Sidechained Bitcoin implies a sidechain, so my response remains consistent.

Sure, and forking Bitcoin and building on that would tie the success of it to the dice roll that is radically changing Bitcoin's security model by adding a ton of stuff on top.  
Either way, you're rolling some dice --- I just think the Ethereum dice are less risky (in this specific case), and you seem to believe the same for forking Bitcoin, fair enough.  We'll see soon enough with the launch of Frontier

Only if the failure is a permanent unfixable issue does it beg the question. You could be a man (woman) of your word and simply make a wager with me personally on this if you don't want to do it on chain. I have my reputation at stake if I don't pay, and you have a pseudonym. So presumably the only reason not to bet is if you're not confident in your convictions. How much would you like to bet?
@_date: 2015-04-18 01:16:42
Sidechains and ethereum are not mutually exclusive, in fact, implementing sidechains in an eth contract will likely be easier than implementing them on a fork of bitcoin.  Finally, you can create distributed federated peg sidechains using something like Augur itself, which is a fun idea to toy around with.  Have been working on our alpha lately but when I have time I'll post a blog post of how something like this would work
Edit: a distributed federated peg like this is impractical due to the slow state of  threshold signatures.  Since btc only supports ~15-20 multisig signatures depending on how you do it, this would require threshold signatures, except they're much to computationally expensive at the moment.  Hopefully as they mature this can be a reality, and we can avoid the negative mining vulnerabilities associated with standard 2-way pegs.
@_date: 2015-04-28 02:53:15
Yep, exactly right. I should definitely make a blog post about this as well as how we mitigate collusion risk is important. Jack has made some but they're quite technical and don't touch on some of the more simple obvious mechanisms we use 
@_date: 2015-04-28 04:53:53
Ok, so Jeremy's link answers your Bitcoin question pretty well. The other issue is something this drastically changing to Bitcoin's code base would never get merged in, so we'd be restricted to forking Bitcoin and sidechaining to the bitcoin blockchain, and we can do the sidechain part with eth anyway. 
I expect it to be usable by very techie people in the coming couple of weeks, most bitcoiners this summer (but with fake money for testing), and live mass usage in the fall (with real money, you'll be able to use either Bitcoin or ether). 
So reputation is the sort of token / score in our system. When reporting on events you need to make sure people can't just Sybil attack the system, so a weighted report is the best way to do this. Your report is weighted by how much reputation you have, and you gain reputation from people who either disagree with the consensus or don't report (which happens every two months to finalize the outcomes of events on Augur). 
If reporting on just a question (say a smart contract wants real world data) you get the fee multiplied by the proportion of reputation you own. If reporting on a question that has been incorporated into a prediction market, you get half the trading fees from that market proportional to how much reputation you have.  The other half the fees go to whoever created the market. So the more volume the prediction markets get, the more reporters are rewarded.  Without a reporting / distributed oracle system like this, you're forced to trust one third party who can lie to get a big payout (and also provides a central point of failure)
@_date: 2015-04-18 01:18:45
Yep --- on the Frontier testnet!  Main bugs that were stopping us from deploying are fixed now.
@_date: 2015-04-19 01:38:41
Important distinction for anyone else reading: it doesn't matter whether or not it's the bitcoin network miners mining on the sidechain, you just need sufficient hashpower to secure the network.  
Let's say there is x potential hashpower in the world that could be used to secure a chain's proof of work, if x is low enough that someone could easily execute a 51% attack you have a problem.  So if x is too low then you're right, the sidechained bitcoin wouldn't be very secure.
An interesting scenario where bitcoin miners &amp; security of a sidechain decouple are if you're using an algorithm that current sha-256 asics can't be easily made to use (and now you're practically dependent solely on your own chain's miners for security, and not # of bitcoin miners merge mining - because they cant).  
If it's sha256 proof of work and not mined by a significant portion of Bitcoin's network, you definitely have a security problem (provided your chain has enough value to make it worth attacking).  
Tldr: If sha256, portion of bitcoin miners mining your sidechain is a good rule of thumb for security.  If a different hashing algorithm, security is gauged same way as Bitcoin's is currently, e.g. "How much would it cost to successfully execute an attack, is hashpower centralized or decentralized, etc.?"

Augur is a sidechain implementation, just not an extension of btc itself
@_date: 2015-04-18 01:43:29
If you read the Sidechains whitepaper you can see in the Appendix that they recommend using decentralized exchanges to transfer sidechained Bitcoin more rapidly then an actual sidechain tx.  You only should be using sidechain transactions (which take days to clear if not federated) occasionally.  
This isn't to say that there won't be sidechained Bitcoin used on Augur (there will), but that most of it will be obtained via decentralized exchanges, just as all sidechained coins will be.  
You asked for a simple how to of how to get BTC into the system &amp; out (decentralized exchanges), not about the intricacies of sidechains &amp; how their whitepaper recommends interfacing with them (decentralized exchanges).

That's what we've built (truthcoin proposed the idea and we've been building it with a couple tweaks - namely taking the first 5 principal components instead of just one).

So on Augur you can propose a question to a distributed oracle system.  You can use this question in a prediction market (where people essentially wager on whether something will happen or not, e.g. "Will Hillary Clinton beat Jeb Bush in 2016?").
You can also leave the question out of any markets and just have the oracles (read: people) report whether Hillary did in fact win.  The reason this is useful is because smart contracts don't have internet access, so they can't check an API or google the answer.  Instead, you're stuck trusting a third party or using a distributed oracle system like Augur.
Basically, we've proposed the first one of these questions in our system on the live Ethereum testnet, as opposed to just running simulations on our own computers
@_date: 2015-04-18 06:47:08
Wasn't thinking of SNARKs - so expensive to compute that we're a few years off on those imo. 
Thanks re gen-1; going to spec that out more later but glad you get the idea :D
Merged mining is mainly useful as a nice security tactic for the new sidechain allowing it to piggyback off the parent chain's security. If you wanted to do a gen 2 style sidechain to eth you would lock your Bitcoin, provide an SPV proof to eth chain (smart contract verifies it). Now you have "Bitcoin" on ethereum. 
To go back you would lock it in an output on ethereum, and submit an SPV proof to the bitcoin blockchain. Now you have Bitcoin again!
Re merge mining: "Since the parent chain clients cannot be expected to observe every sidechain, users import proofs of work from the sidechain into the parent chain in order to prove possession." - Grabbed that from the paper; merged mining isn't required, but can be mutually beneficial for miners (more tx fees) and sidechains (more security). 
Edit: for anyone else who's curious, interesting thread here about sidechains and merged mining: 
Seems coindesk accidentally stated they require merged mining, which as nullc (a core dev) replies, isn't actually correct. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 05:05:23
Well, not really, we've discussed this elsewhere many times on reddit and adding augur to Bitcoin would be enough of a radical shift to Bitcoin's security model that it's really not that much less risky than ethereum. And from a codebase level, it's extremely less complex. 
Can we just make a bet on this - I want to see you put your money where your mouth is ;).  Let's make a bet on whether ethereum will have some sort of catastrophic consensus failure after 1.0 launch, and we can let our reporters determine the outcome.  Deal?

@_date: 2015-03-11 06:50:39
Sorry I missed this, have been coding in preparation for our alpha so haven't had time to get on reddit much.


No prediction market has ever used real money with real volume besides InTrade, which got shut down in 2013.  So prediction markets have existed for "decades" just as much as electronic currencies existed for "decades" before Bitcoin.  Google doesn't *have* PMs to add to their results.


Prediction markets require you to buy and sell shares, it's not a Keynesian beauty contest as you describe here.


Prediction markets *do* in fact predict and provide for great forecasting tools, and there are decades of economic research supporting this.  Checkout some of Robin Hanson's work on this.  Along with: 


Again, not how PMs work: 


Of course not :) - but it does provide the first censorship resistant, global, prediction market on anything where people can use real money


The meetup organizer has no vested interest in our project at all (in fact, I'd never even talked to the guy until the day I gave a talk there).  
Aminok got it right here: "Second, a token is not necessarily a currency that claims to replace Bitcoin's function as money. In the case of Augur, their tokens give users a reputation that allows them to vote on events. This token grows or shrinks depending on the accuracy of the votes. It has a real use. Tokenization is the future, and we shouldn't fear it."  
Rep is used to weight reports in our system, and reporters (essentially distributed oracles) get some trading fees for reporting.  You can't use bitcoin for reporting (although you can use it for trading shares of events on our system).  
The easiest way to distribute reputation would be to hand it out (a la stellar).  The problem is, it's easily sybil attacked if you do that, and we want reputation holders to be the most vested in our system (the game theory behind reporting doesn't really work out otherwise).  I suppose you could do a btc burn, but why not fund continued development of the project instead?  I think that's better than lighting money on fire, but some disagree.  
Also, all of our crowdsale funds will be held in escrow by Koinify conditional that we deliver on certain development milestones (and we'll have an alpha out before the crowdsale, so if you don't believe me simply wait for the alpha).  I would wait for our alpha release too before deciding anything about our ability to deliver, it's simply the smart thing to do!
If you have any serious questions about our project (or are interested in learning more about how it actually works), I'd be happy to explain them here, or get on a call with you about it.  


I'm not trying to sell you on anything besides the information aggregation tool Augur can provide (I figured not mentioning the fact that we're doing a crowdsale in the entire presentation may have hinted at that).  (Oh, and our system will allow you to buy/sell shares in bitcoin, to reiterate).  Feel free to shoot me an email anytime @ joeykrug

It's not faith --- I'm testing our code on the Ethereum network and it works (using their latest releases of pyethereum and serpent to compile to EVM opcodes).  The biggest concern with ethereum would be some catastrophic consensus failure I suppose, however, proof of work is pretty well tested, leaving you with 51% attack risk, which almost all decentralized cryptosystems have in some form or another.
Regarding the Counterparty asset --- they used to have an asset where 1 BTC was equal to one of these XBTC I believe it was called, anyway it's gone now (according to their forums they removed it due to regulatory concerns).

Clef has delicious community dinners for being an NSA front. Anyway, pretty sure it's just public key crypto, no need for blockchain to do what Clef's doing!  Very cool stuff though, and useful for laziness

And you get some trading fees from the markets you report on as well!  (the other portion of the fees go to whoever created the market)

The more reputation you have, the more trading fees you get!

Thank you!  You pretty much hit the nail on the head.  We should have an alpha out sometime in March and then we can begin seeing how it works in practice beyond just simulations, I can't wait!

Yep --- once Ethereum supports sidechains we'll allow you to use sidechained btc!

So the thing is, liars are likely to lie about many things right (as you pointed out above).  The hard part is it's hard for liars to coordinate on what they lie on (especially if they can't prove whether or not they lied on something).  
So if you're reporting on say 30 things, to execute a successful attack you have to get enough people to lie in unison on each of those 30 events, not just the one you want to manipulate (otherwise the system will quickly catch you).  And since other liars are going to have to think you're telling them the truth when you say "Of course, let's vote on x even though y happened" it's a major problem (for the liars)!
There's also a few redundancy systems including a report auditing system (we haven't implemented these yet, they're just in the conceptual stage).

Converting Bitcoin into a stablecoin could be done with a decentralized exchange (etherex is one, Joseph Chow @ Ethereum is also working on another one).  As far as maintaining value, there's a lot of approaches described here: 
What will likely end up happening is we'll support multiple currencies on Augur (using the subcurrency api from Ethereum).  We haven't made any firm decisions re stablecoins yet because we're waiting a bit to see how they develop.
