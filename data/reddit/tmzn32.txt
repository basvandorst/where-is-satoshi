-What is taking so long for coinbase exchange to come to CT?
-Verifying the backup credit card on coinbase is having trouble, and I can no longer buy bitcoin instantly.  I received an email that coinbase is working on a fix, but what is the ETA?
-Do you keep your LTC in cold storage or on an exchange? Is it worth taking LTC off of BTCE if I don't plan to trade in the near future? Paper wallets?

If I send Bitcoin to a paper wallet, and check the balance on the block chain, it must have my public key if it's able to tell me how much is on the wallet?

I don't see this app on the app store...

Why can't I simply search it on the app store on my phone and download it from there.  It does not show up..

Look on the bright side, it was a cheap lesson learned.
