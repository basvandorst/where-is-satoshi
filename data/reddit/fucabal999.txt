BTC price is definitely being suppressed by the "controllers"/central banks.
You just need to look at the gold/silver market to see how they do it its the exact same strategy. Sell the paper (futures) and buy the physical. The reason they are suppressing the price is to discourage people from owning these asset classes. It is a lot more effective than "banning" as banning anything explodes the price and just leads to an underground market.
They want people to own fiat and stock (just look at japan, BOJ owns like 50% of all japanese companies LOL) to fuel the debt slavery.
The banking cabal has unlimited resources, has started world wars to protect their racket, invaded and killed Sadam to protect petro dollar, murdered Gadaffi to prevent Libyan gold backed currency (read Killary leaked emails about NATO), and you think they are just going to sit back and watch BTC undermine their power? To the children who think they "have better things to do" you are just naive to the ways of the world.
They will crash BTC so low (maybe &lt;$1K) and make people hate it. The more futures markets volume there is the easier it will be for them to crash it. Nasdaq future going live in 2019 = crash.
Eventually, their suppression will stop, and gold/silver/btc will all moon (USD will collapse) however at that point they will be pushing their own centralized coin as the saviour (XRP already  LOL? Coincidence?), or sell "fraudulent copies" of BTC (A certificate to redeem BTC or fractional reserve BTC where you don't own the keys).
Even Bakkt with their supposed "physical delivery"/settlement is being "wharehoused" LOL, by them, which means they will just use those coins to bet against you even more. Leasing out other people's gold/silver is already done on mass you don't think they will do it to BTC?
Remember BTC started so you could be your own bank. NOT YOUR KEYS NOT YOUR COINS!
