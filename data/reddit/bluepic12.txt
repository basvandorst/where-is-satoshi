Forgive me, as I new to this.  This logic does not make sense to me as Bitcoin's value is inherently based on USD.  Sure, the price will go up.  but you can only buy more bitcoin with USD..  so the USD has some type of value to trade it for bitcoin.

Great question it's something I first asked when starting my journey in Bitcoin.  This is basically how I phrased it. 
"Forgive me, as I new to this. This logic does not make sense to me as Bitcoin's value is inherently based on USD. Sure, the price will go up. but you can only buy more bitcoin with USD.. so the USD has some type of value to trade it for bitcoin." - This was my response to people saying the reason they want bitcoin is because USD is losing value. 
To me there has to be some sort of catalyst when bitcoin overtakes Fiat as a term of value in order to come a form of "currency".  If that happens USD would need to fall drastically but woldn't that also make bitcoin fall since it's based on $USD?

Guy with 20 million in Bitcoin:  We believe bitcoin can go higher if we pump it up.

How else can you buy it without getting verified?

A global economic collapse would take down bitcoin also, but I see your point.

Stocks, yes.  Mutual Funds, no.  Go put your money in a Vanguard fund.  Put 5% or so in speculative stocks/bitcoin.

To make more bitcoin?

Yea but it wouldn't be the same crazy jump up that was "the bubble".  A reset to around $10,000 then it would have to be a steady climb back up.  Won't see the 300% in 3 days situation again, or at least that's what I think this is saying.

I think it hit's $8,000 I would wait a little longer.
