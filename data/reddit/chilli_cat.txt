Na, 
Didn't work, had mental anguish not checking every hour ( erm. 10 minutes more like!) ��

Only used Bittylicious so far for my transactions and have been very happy with them. Smooth and reliable, not a hitch. 
My only problem is that in the last few weeks I have been ready to purchase a little more (when I think it's a dip) but found that the bitty price does not drop when the market drops, so I will need to look elsewhere for those transactions.
I guess it's that their vendors do not want to sell at that rate.

Don't think of it as a 24 hour investment, more like a 24 month investment. 
It goes up and down, if it goes up, feels like you should have bought more, of it goes down, ya should have bought less.

Fecking hope so
C'mon bitcoin, get up of your arse and fight back!

Wow!    that was quick!
Just bought 0.1 and I reckon that hit the wallet in under a minute!
Not traded for a while and that is radically different from the 30 mins or hour that I used to wait
Even a  Lego Lambo is still a distant dream

It is highly unlikely that the BTC price will stay the same over the weekend. After extensive analysis, I suspect that it will either go up or down.

It's a one horsepower vehicle

Looks really interesting...
More tools the better, although my gut instinct is that bitcoin just refuses to obey the logical rules...

Actually, I think you are into something here, look how difficult (rightly) that it is to have access to your current stash of crypto across multiple sources with multiple passwords and authentication.      Now think how difficult it will be if you (and your saved passwords/devices are not available....... Suspect that many will just disappear

As much as I empathise with you right now... The old bear just says "let's just eat all the bulls"
That's how it feels at the moment, but as an eternal optimist, I really do believe that we are on the cusp. YMMV
