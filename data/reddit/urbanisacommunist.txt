Honestly it's exhausting trying to explain this to you, since you are clearly incapable of understanding it, so I'll try to keep this brief. What don't you understand about my example about Oprah and her car giveaway? It's irrelevant whether you have enough cash on hand to pay your tax bill. No, the IRS can't force you to come up with money you don't have, but they do have the legal authority to send you to jail--and seize any tangible assets you do have, like a car, a house, or even furniture and literally anything else of tangible value that can be attached to you.


Wtf are you even arguing? Yes, like all tax evaders, you could avoid paying and go to jail for 10-20 years. There are lots of people out there who have tax bills they can't pay. If Joe Schmoe owes $10k in taxes and he spends it on hookers and blow instead, there is no money for the IRS to take out of his account.
In your example, no, the IRS can't torture you to give up your key to your personal wallet (though if you are using something like coinbase, you can absolutely kiss your crypto goodbye). But they'd seize any tangible assets you do have or tried to purchase after getting out of jail.


Like I said before, if you're a regular Joe and you owe $10k in taxes just on regular income (e.g. wages), but you spend it on hookers and blow, the court can't get that money back. That's basically what you're saying, and I am not arguing that that's not true. All I am saying is that they can still send you to jail and seize literally any tangible asset you try to purchase for the rest of your life.


lol you're further out on a ledge than I thought. The fuckin' United States of America ain't afraid of a bunch of crypto bros I can tell you that right now. Whether or not they think it's worth going after a bunch of law-breaking, tax-evading crypto bros is irrelevant. You're breaking the law, and if they want to take you down they will. By all means, take that risk and evade taxes if you want. Millions of people already do this, and it's been going on since *long* before cryptos were ever invented, so you certainly won't be the first. But don't delude yourself into thinking that the world's foremost military superpower is at all afraid of pissing off a bunch of crypto bros.


Read my lips: *Whether the IRS could catch you is irrelevant.* It. is. still. illegal. You are still a criminal if you evade taxes.


Yes, go ahead and break the law if you want, no one is stopping you.


In the previous paragraph you just advocated evading taxes and then in this paragraph you say you're not advocating tax evasion? Which is it? You explicitly said that your logic is to:


I am assuming that when you say "cash out" you are referring to converting to USD. All I am saying is that if you follow that rule blindly, you could end up evading taxes. That is a fact. Whether you can get away with it *IS NOT RELEVANT* to the truth of this fact.
@_date: 2018-01-14 05:57:56


This is where you are wrong. You clearly didn't read the article I linked or are simply incapable of understanding this very simple concept. It's *ALL* about what the law says. Suppose you bought 10 BTC early last year and then traded them for 150 ETH toward the end of the year. You owe capital gains in USD on that transaction according to the exchange-rate of BTC for USD at the time you bought it and the time you traded it for ETH. What don't you understand about that? 
From the law's perspective, it doesn't matter one iota whether you have USD to pay your bill. Of course it could be hard for them to catch you at this point especially if you are not using an exchange at all. However, most people use exchanges, and you are still breaking the law by not figuring out what you owe and paying it. Once again, if you want to be a twat and break the law that's your prerogative I guess. The IRS can and will send you a tax bill if they find out. Whether you can manage to evade taxes is a different matter entirely. The law is the law. Theoretically, drug dealers owe taxes on the drugs they sell too. Drug dealers are also tax evaders.
Your argument is basically "Well I don't think it makes sense and I could totally get away with breaking the law". Fine, go ahead and be a tax-evading fuckwad. It truly amazes me that tax evading fuckwads think they are revolutionizing the finance world for the better and getting rid of a corrupt elite class. Anyone who doesn't pay their tax bill is a hundred times worse.


You keep saying the same thing over and over, i.e. "you physically can't pay"! But saying the same thing over and over doesn't make it right. What you clearly can't get through your head is the fact that it's irrelevant whether you have enough fiat to pay your tax bill. It's the same with stocks. Theoretically you could buy 10 shares of GOOGL and then trade them directly for 100 shares of AAPL at a later point. But you have to record the USD value of your GOOGL shares at the time you traded them for AAPL and record what your capital gains were. You owe taxes on capital gains. It does not matter that you have AAPL shares, not USD. You still owe capital gains in USD.


What don't you understand about the fact that whether the IRS is capable of catching you for tax evasion is irrelevant to whether or not you are evading taxes? Like I said, you would be surprised at the number of Average Joe's who haven't paid taxes in 10 years. The IRS doesn't have the resources to catch even every single blatant, broad-daylight tax evader. I am not saying you could not get away with it.


I am shilling for following the law, you are apparently shilling for breaking the law. And wtf is a "fictional virtual asset?" Cryptocurrencies are very clearly defined assets according to the IRS. It is clear you haven't read literally anything about the law though, so I wouldn't expect you to know that.


No, the law is still the law. Whether they would catch you evading taxes is another matter entirely. Yes you could probably get away with it. Millions of people in the U.S. get away with crimes of varying degrees every year.


You know so incredibly little about tax law it's almost frightening. Once again, whether or not you had enough money so you "COULD" pay taxes *is... not... relevant.* Remember when Oprah gave away a bunch of cars to her audience? [Anyone who accepted the gift owed taxes on the USD value of the car]( Up to $7,000. According to your logic, they shouldn't owe anything because how can you pay the IRS if all you got was a car and not cash? Does. Not. Matter. If you didn't have $7,000 in extra cash to pay the IRS, you couldn't accept the gift. Well, you could, but then you'd owe the IRS $7,000 and they may or may not track you down for being the tax evader that you are.


Umm, okay? For the last time, whether or not you can get away with tax evasion is not my point. Millions of people get away with outright tax evasion every year. They are called criminals, and they are committing a felony.

@_date: 2018-01-14 07:52:49
You're missing the point. If you're using an exchange, there is a record of the value of your investment (in USD) at the time you bought in and the time you traded it for another crypto. You owe capital gains on the difference. Whether they could track you down is irrelevant to the issue of whether or not you owe taxes.

You're advocated tax evasion in literally every post you've made in this thread. I'm just alerting you to that fact. You keep saying you should only pay taxes after you cash out in fiat. But according to the letter of the law, you could owe taxes even if you haven't cashed out in fiat. You are denying that simple truth. End of story.
@_date: 2018-01-14 03:07:08
Every time you trade a coin for another coin it is a taxable event. If your initial holding increased in USD it doesn't matter if you didn't convert back to fiat, you still have to pay taxes if you get rid of it for e.g. other coins.
@_date: 2018-01-14 04:47:12


Yes it is. If you don't want to follow the law and pay taxes as described by law then GTFO of here. You aren't starting a revolution by not paying taxes, you're being a twat. You're no better than the corrupt corporatists who screw everyone over by gaming the system in their favor. In fact, you're worse, because while they are at least robbing us in broad daylight, you are scheming behind the scenes.


This is not true as of 2018 (at it was a debatable loophole to begin with). [Look it up]( It's clear you haven't even researched this at all. It doesn't matter if you haven't yet cashed out in USD. You still owe USD if you got rid of a coin that increased in value in USD while you were holding it. If you don't have the cash then you need to convert some of your coins back to fiat.


Once again, this isn't true. The exchanges track how much your investment increased in value according to USD while you were holding it. After you sell (whether it be for another coin or for fiat) you owe taxes on what you gained.


Whether or not you think it's logical or possible is irrelevant. It's the law. You owe taxes on the net sum of your returns from all your trades across the year. If you were holding $10,000 worth of BTC at the start of the year and on Dec 31 you exchanged it for $150,000 of ETH, then you owe taxes on your $140,000 gain. You better come up with the cash or sell some of the ethereum you just bought. This is actually a rather big danger around the start of the new year (and it's one that stock traders are quite familiar with). Suppose you didn't hold for over a year, so you're taxed according to whatever income bracket you're in. Your tax bill in the above example could be close to $50,000. If ethereum plunged ~70% in the new year and your net liq drops to less than $50,000, *you still owe the IRS $50,000*.


Because it's the law and you can't get away with the like-exchanges loophole anymore. The IRS does not care whether you think it's fair or makes sense.
Once again, I guess it's up to you whether you want to risk it not paying taxes. But you are bound by law to figure out what you owe and pay it. Sure, there's a lot of assholes out there who haven't paid taxes in years and are just betting they won't get audited, but thousands of people go to jail for tax evasion every year.
@_date: 2018-01-14 05:59:16
Every crypto-to-crypto transaction is a taxable event, and the IRS has mandated that the exchanges provide all of that information. They have a record of the USD exchange rates at the time of the trade even though you are trading crypto-to-crypto and the trade doesn't involve USD.
@_date: 2018-01-14 04:50:29
It boggles my mind how many people around here haven't even done enough homework to know this. But what you knew or didn't know is irrelevant when the IRS is calling you 10 years down the line, handing you a $100,000 tax bill. Literally everyone in the USA is required to figure out for themselves what they owe in taxes.

Without debt, the economy is a million times more unequal than it already is. Debt is truly an amazing thing if you aren't a fucking moron.

Unregulated markets are fucking disastrous for the working class, as literally every economic crisis in the 1800s and early 1900s has shown. Tell me, do you know literally fucking anything about the financial history of the U.S.? In what way does the fed fleece the middle class?

None of your critiques addresses the real-life impracticalities of a deflationary currency that isn't used as a currency and doesn't even operate as efficiently as its competitors.
We are at "global warming denier" levels of insanity here. 99/100 scientists agree global warming is driven by humans. 51/53 economists think Bitcoin is a bubble. It's up to you to decide which side you think is right.
FWIW, I do agree that the fact that Bitcoin is generally not bought on credit (so far) lends credence to idea that Bitcoin still has a lot of room to run before it inevitably crashes and burns. I firmly believe that 10 years from now it will have lost 99.9% of its present value, but that's irrelevant for the short term. It will be interesting to see how the markets develop from here as Bitcoin derivatives expand. The ability to expose yourself to Bitcoin using credit is starting to pick up, especially with the introduction of futures (FWIW volume has been incredibly low, but it's only been 1 week on CBOE and CME just started).

Your mistake is in thinking this is a good thing and not a bad thing. Anyone with even a passing history of the U.S. financial history knows that regulation and centralization only helps the little guy. In the American gilded age there was very little regulation and centralization, and it was common to get financial panics that devastated the economy and lead to widespread unemployment. The people who get hurt the most during bank runs are not the bankers themselves (who know how to hedge and protect their wealth) but rather the working class who can see their life savings wiped out overnight. This was the whole reason for the creation of the Federal Reserve. There will always haves and have nots no matter what the currency is (how else would you characterize e.g. the Winklevoss twins?).

Hard to make a judgment like that. Good in terms of what? For people who dreamt of Bitcoin actually being used as a real currency I suppose it's bad. Speculative commodities with huge price springs don't make for good currencies. Imagine if the value of the dollar doubled or halved in a week. There would be tanks in the streets. But it's not just that. Bitcoin is fundamentally deflationary. Even if the price stabilizes people aren't going to want to use it in everyday transactions, especially not on credit. When everyone is hodling, it begs the question of what they are waiting for. When Bitcoin reaches 100K suddenly people are just going to start using it? Doesn't seem likely.

It can't be broken into infinitely smaller parts though. The smallest unit right now is a satoshi.


No, it still wouldn't work. Even if you could divide a satoshi further, there is still a fundamental deflationary pressure in the fact that Bitcoins are constantly lost and disappear from the market. Deflation erodes the time value of money and reduces the incentive to use your assets to improve economic productivity. It also promotes inequality  and economic stagnancy by severely curtailing the benefits of credit expansion.


It's not bullshit. Are you on record as a global warming denier? Fox News might want you as a guest.


Most climate scientists can't predict the weather either, does that mean we should all be climate change skeptics? It is false to go ahead and state that economic models rely on people acting rationally--Robert Shiller won a Nobel Prize for demonstrating that investors *do not* act rationally. Economists think Bitcoin is a bubble because it exhibits virtually all the characteristic properties of historical bubbles since the dawn of financial markets. As to *when* Bitcoin will crash is not near as obvious.


The problem is that Bitcoin has never been around during a liquidity trap. We are in the middle of the greatest economic expansion the world has ever seen. When liquidity dries up, Bitcoin will spike even higher, then plummet when everyone realizes there is nothing you can do with it. This is assuming that the bubble doesn't burst under its own weight before then. Or new financial regulation on cryptos tanks the market. Bitcoin's presence in traditional financial markets has been virtually zero for most of its existence. We are just now beginning to see spike in (a) using credit to buy Bitcoin, and (b) new Bitcoin derivatives.


Futures markets do not reduce volatility. They add liquidity and make price discovery more rapid. There is a large body of work behind this.

What you're completing missing in all of this is the very large amount of people who accrued large amounts of Bitcoin without the need of a digital broker like Coinbase. Criminals, hackers, and drug dealers have been using it for years. There has always been a Bitcoin economy that exists outside the realm of brokers tied to bank accounts. The *whole damn point* of Bitcoin according to everyone on this subreddit is that it replaces the need for bank accounts and fiat currency. You don't need to interact with the IRS when you aren't dealing with dollars.
Sure, it's possible for the NSA/FBI/CIA to try to track people down, but it's just an ongoing battle. I guess in some sense crypto is both completely open and completely anonymous. Open in the sense that all transactions are on the ledger, anonymous in that it's not easy to track down who owns a particular wallet unless that wallet is tied to a bank account or some other activity that is traceable.

I obviously don't. I'm just saying that it's a two way fight, and that there's a lot of anonymity in the Bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:44:57
Why is it that depending on the person I talk to, I'm told Bitcoin is both anonymous (and thus free from the prying eyes of the dastardly government) *and* non-anonymous?
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:09:55
And that is why you're a fool who will lose all his money in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:24:58


@_date: 2017-12-07 07:53:20
And thus you have discovered why Bitcoin would be a terrible, terrible currency.
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:57:28


This is just absolutely false. You need to be able to inject liquidity into the economy in times of recession. To do that, you need to be able to make more currency out of nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:39:48
You are completely and totally missing the point. There was no credit involved in this transaction. This is just a Bitcoin 1 percent-er buying a home outright from some idiots trying to capitalize on the mania.
Ask yourself, how many people buy a house in cash? The problem is that for the average person, buying a home outright, whether in cash, gold, or Bitcoin, is impossible. So who is going to loan you enough Bitcoin to buy a house? Who in their right mind would give or take a loan in Bitcoin?
Let's imagine a BTC economy. Your income is 0.5 BTC per month. You find someone to loan you 10 BTC to buy a house. A year later BTC is now 100% more expensive. Houses are going for 5 BTC and hour income is 0.25 BTC per month. So now your house isn't even 50% of what you owe and is a whopping 40x your monthly income instead of 20x. And it just gets worse and worse every year. You will never pay your loan off, ever.
Even assuming more reasonable values like 5% or 10% deflation, it doesn't work. Deflation is utterly catastrophic for any credit based economy. No one would ever be able to take a loan. You couldn't ever buy a house or start a business. It would be the most catastrophically unequal society imaginable. The haves would permanently control all capital in society, because the have nots would never be able to use credit to get ahead.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:18:46
Neither buyers nor sellers want to accept it due to its volatility. The only people using it are individual shmucks and drug dealers. Everything else is ironically bragging about how much their BTC is worth *in USD*, lmao. What does that say about BTC?
Not to mention that BTC literally cannot be used in ways that are fundamental to the way our economy works, due to the way BTC undermines the time value of money. Want to start a business? Who the fuck is going to loan you enough BTC to do that? Want to buy a house? Want to buy a car? Credit is heavily disincentivized with a deflationary currency like BTC. We would be back to the stone ages.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:52:01
People who talk in these terms don't seem to understand the nature of the credit system or the economy in general. Bitcoin is fundamentally a deflationary currency i.e. it gains value the more people are using it (because there is a limited supply). This means that it would be moronic to ever loan someone Bitcoin. But loans and credit are what stimulates economic expansion and growth. Even in the regular world, when people are hoarding currencies there are *severe* economic consequences. Say what you want about the Fed, but if they hadn't essentially printed money in 2008 to inject liquidity into the banking system the entire world economy would have completely gone down in flames.
So guess what happens in a Bitcoin economy where there is literally no incentive at all not to hoard currency? The economy screeches to a halt.
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:52:23
Nice attempt to save face but you are not going to recover from the ludicrous embarrassment of not knowing what I was referring to when I said technical analysis. Now you're just digging yourself into a bigger hole by calling the entire finance world "trivial." lol finance runs the entire fucking world. And there are a lot of very old, sophisticated, and well developed theories behind it. It is anything but trivial.


Yikes, you are even more off the deep end than I thought.


That's not what I said at all. I said it could crash under its own weight at any time, which cannot be predicted. It is also practically *certain* to crash approximately 6 months after the end of the current credit cycle. That's when I would short. Otherwise you are just trying to call the top on a bubble in an expanding economy, which is impossible.


I'm here to learn more about Bitcoin and its community and thus devise a more robust strategy with regards to shorting it.
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:59:56


No you don't, lol. Can you even name 100 people in real life who you have talked to, period, in the last year?
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:14:50
lol the "average joe" just parrots bits and pieces of what they hear (or think they hear) on television, or from *their* mates. This is true for pretty much anything in finance. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:17:00
I'm an asshole because I corrected you? You acted like you knew what you were talking about but gave demonstrably false information. [December is literally the absolute *best* month for stocks since 1950]( 50 times up and 17 times down. I'm not trying to be harsh, but only a newbie investor would not know that December is a great month for stocks.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:24:42


What incentive is there to use a deflationary currency? Who exactly is going to be using Bitcoin for transactions instead of dollars? Even now I find it ironic that Bitcoin is always quoted in terms of its ratio to dollars. All of the big hubbub surround Bitcoin is FOMO morons chasing unsustainable returns. There's no big slate of large retail distributers planning to start accepting Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is currently being traded as a commodity. Like gold, it is and always will be fundamentally worthless (except you can't wear Bitcoin jewelry). Similarly, economies that run on gold or Bitcoin don't work in the modern era. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:14:35
Yes, bitcoin will be with more than 10x the entire world economy in no time, truly we are seeing the beginning of a new paradigm... where fucking retards just make up numbers on the internet.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:43:58
Gartman? This is far and away the most bullish case for Bitcoin yet.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:48:46
In what way?
Bitcoin really is just some number on the internet. It may represent the 1st in class of a technology that will be useful in the future, but right now that technology is extremely limited in scope. Not to mention that there's no indication Bitcoin will be the dominant crypto used at any point in the future. Everyone in finance knows Bitcoin as it is would be a terrible, awful, unimaginably bad predominant currency. Almost as bad as gold.
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:52:55


What a stupid analogy. I buy the computer because I need the computer now. That's completely different from financial assets, which I purchase to generate future cash flows.


Deflation by definition erodes the time value of money. You cannot possibly refute that. If I know my money is going to be worth more the longer I hold onto it, then there's less incentive to trade it in for financial assets.


This whole rant is pointless. Saying banks are really giving "IOUs" due to the fractional reserve scheme represents a fundamental misunderstanding of what money really is. Advocating for Bitcoin is akin to advocating for the gold standard. You think you're advocating for "real" money, but all you're really doing is tying money to an inflexible, deflationary commodity.


You fuck off. Our entire economy is based on credit. How does Bitcoin solve literally any of the problems related to credit expansion? How is it any better than the gold standard?


It actually does. Quite ignorant to say it doesn't.


Oh wow you've got a B.S. Any other amazing credentials you want to list? Way to try to turn this into an online dick measuring contest.


You're totally twisting what I said and drawing the most absurd conclusions possible from it. And my science background is sublime--but like I said, I'm not really into online dick measuring contests.


You're right, all economic models are wrong because people are not completely rational actors. Close up the books, economics is a dead field. just took it down.


Shells and feathers have been used as a medium of exchange but not really ever as money.


Rapid price discovery does not reduce volatility.
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:24:41
Because Bitcoin isn't a digital currency as was originally envisioned. It's a speculative commodity. It can take weeks to ship gold around the country, but that doesn't stop the gold speculators. Speculators gonna speculate.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:50:36


Lmao what careful analysis did you use to conclude this? Why not a billion? Or a trillion? Or a googolplex?
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:42:49
Gold in the 60s and 70s was a speculative bubble. Today gold is worth less than a third of its 1980 peak, adjusted for inflation.
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:27:08


Yeah you're gonna need a source for that. Do you have any idea how many futures products there are out there? I find it impossible to believe they are all decades old. Not to mention that gold futures have been around since the 70s, so it seems to me like you don't know what you're talking about.

It's only capital gains if your position gained value in USD terms from the time you bought to the time you sold/exchanged. Even though you aren't converting to USD, you are closing the position, and thus you pay taxes on however much the position increased.

Not to mention that 1,000 wallets control 40% of all Bitcoin. There is a 0.1% with regard to Bitcoin. Supposing they will act differently from any other 0.1%ers is ludicrous. Especially considering the anonymity and criminality involved with Bitcoin.

And like most of those people on DOND, you and everyone else who has gotten in this late to the game will lose all your paper gains and more when the market inevitably crashes.
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:40:41
The whole point of Bitcoin was supposed to be that you can use it as currency. Having to convert to USD negates its purpose.
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:18:05
There's no good answer. Technical trading has been a thing for a long time in equity and commodity markets, and people who believe in it will pull up all sorts of charts to show you support lines and Fibonacci ratios and Elliot Waves to try to make you believe it's possible to predict. Most people lose money trying to do this. Thus, the more common approach is to refer to fundamentals (what Warren Buffet does).
Since there are no fundamentals for Bitcoin, it is impossible to say where it's headed. In general, crashes are caused when there's a large volume of selling from someone cashing out. The dotcom crash started with some very high volume sell orders in March 2000 and then snowballed from there.
What makes you think anyone can predict where the price will go?
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:42:14
Gold is a commodity that's been around for thousands of years and has use in decoration, jewelry, and industrial tools. Bitcoin is some numbers on the internet.

Fiat isn't backed with anything but it's been the standard for a *long* time now. It's also regulated. That's a good thing, despite what the average gold bug wants to believe. The days of unregulated financial mania (1840-1910 in the U.S.) led to steeper downturns than anyone alive has ever seen. When Joe Shmoe is driving down to the grocery and buying a gallon of milk with nothing but Bitcoin, please let me know so I can leave the country asap.

In what way does Bitcoin force everyone to operate by the same rules and eliminate a financial elite class? Surely people like the Winklevoss twins and anyone else with large amounts of Bitcoin constitute a new crypto elite?
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:44:40


I'm doing very well for myself actually, thank you very much. You, on the other hand, are a financially illiterate fucktard who is going to lose all his money in the inevitable Bitcoin crash. The idea that Bitcoin is not a bubble is just so insanely ludicrous, only the most brainwashed techie neckbeard on the planet could possibly say it's not. All of the people who got in early know it's a bubble. The Winklevoss twins know it's a bubble. There is [literally no way to fundamentally value Bitcoin]( Bitcoin has exhibited practically all of the characteristic properties of historical bubbles in financial markets.


The fact that you are trying to brag about your socioeconomic status tells me all I need to know about where you lie--and it's not near the top. You literally just insulted me with the term "little brain" and then you have the gall to talk down to me? lmfao do you have any fucking idea how stupid you sound?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:06:08
Bitcoin will never be adopted as a dominant currency because it's deflationary. Banks can't exist in a world run by Bitcoin, and without banks we might as well be hunter gatherers. End of story.
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:29:14
You can go to outer space and buy legos in USD too. But in any case, your lists consists entirely of things that have no bearing on the average Joe. All this talk about Bitcoin being a revolution completely misses the point that if Bitcoin *did* become the dominant currency, you'd just be replacing the old elite with a new one. It's like Orwell's *Animal Farm*. It doesn't matter if it's USD, GBP, CNY, Bitcoin, Litecoin, or sea shells, there are always going to be the haves and the have nots, and the haves are always going to write the rules in their favor.
How often does the average person have their assets frozen? How often does anyone stop the average person from spending money? 99% of the time these powers are used to stop criminals and ne'er-do-wells. Julian Assuage can whine all he wants, but especially with the spate of recent revolutions, is it really *that* hard to believe he might actually be guilty? And what other cases can you think of where someone wrongfully had their assets frozen?


The ability of governments to issue currency is actually a good thing, believe it or not. A little bit of controlled inflation stimulates the economy. You are trying to reverse 100 years of economic dogma and take us back to the wild west and gilded age where the elite truly *did* fuck everyone over time and time again. The Federal Reserve was established to *protect* the little guy. You are trying to take away elected representatives' power to affect the economy which is an absolutely horrifying thought. At the end of the day, I'd still rather have an elected Congress be able to control the money supply rather than leave it up to the 1,000 relatively ambiguous users who control 40% of all Bitcoin. Or even worse, just leave it up to the "wisdom of crowds". Unregulated markets inevitably blow up.
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:11:11
Yeah everyone is saying sell, that's why the price has gone up 2000% in a year... lmfao you are truly  fucking retarded.

The "like kind exchange" loophole for cryptos was always legally dubious. And now it's explicitly removed.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:34:20
First of all you're just picking random numbers. Why should Bitcoin be worth half of gold's market cap? What if gold crashes 50%, or 90% from here? Why shouldn't Bitcoin be worth 0X gold, 0.5X gold, 2X gold, 5X gold, 1,000,000X gold?
Second of all, I think you need to rethink the comparison to gold. Gold isn't a currency, nor does it claim to be one. It's also in the middle of a 6 year bear market and going nowhere right now. It's praised by notorious doom and gloomer goldbugs who no one takes seriously. It is widely agreed that the gold standard was a stupid concept. It peaked in real value nearly 40 years ago. It does have limited use in jewelry and industry. Which of these characteristics are actually positive in terms of the "bitcoin is digital gold" assumption?
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:09:33
You truly have no fucking clue about economics, do you? Tell me, how does the average Joe buy a house in a Bitcoin economy? Let's imagine you make 0.5 BTC a month and you take a 10 BTC loan to buy a house. A year later your house is worth 5 BTC and your monthly income is 0.25 BTC due to massive deflation. You will never pay off your loan. Your will be a slave to your debt the rest of your life.

Wow, the funniest part about this comment is that you have absolutely no idea what a dumbass you've proven yourself to be. [Technical analysis]( is a very specific and well-defined term in finance. It is particularly relevant for Bitcoin, because although I usually give more weight to [fundamental analysis]( in my portfolio, one cannot do fundamental analysis on Bitcoin.


Might take longer than a year, depending on how long the current credit cycle lasts. That is likely another 3-5 years and perhaps even up to 10. Bitcoin could of course crash under it's own weight long before that, but that's not nearly as predictable. The real carnage will come around the time of the next recession + financial crisis, when Bitcoin will inevitably spike to one last high (as people speculate on it as a safe haven) before crashing once and for all (once people realize that like gold *a la* 2011, it's utterly useless and impractical as either a safe haven or an actual currency).
Anyway, thanks again for helping to confirm that Bitcoin is being propped up by economically illiterate morons who don't have a shred of actual knowledge about finance.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:57:46
This is exactly why the banks won't touch BTC with a 10-ft pole. Look at the volume. 502 Bitcoin contracts traded yesterday. Meanwhile, 1.5 *million* ES-mini contracts were traded (S&amp;P 500 index futures). And futures as a whole are a very small part of the business these banks do. The degree to which banks are actually exposing themselves to BTC is miniscule.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:46:22
The fact that some people are unaware that market crashes can happen still baffles me. We have so many examples of this *exact* fucking principle. You don't think people said the same thing during the dotcom boom?

Eh, I don't think it's a matter of not caring about money. I agree with you that it's better to have an abundance mindset than a scarcity mindset, but I would describe this more in terms of preventing oneself from being being penny wise and pound foolish. Not that I think it's good to pursue monetary wealth above everything else (far from it), just that doing so doesn't necessarily make someone a bad money manager as you imply. It's more about becoming financially literate and financially independent.
