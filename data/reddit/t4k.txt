I really hope you just needed that money which caused you to sell so fast. If you waited sold now you could have made 400! Wait another x days who knows what you could have made. 160 is nothing is this world.

Yes i held. I've bought at 1100, 800, 750, and wanted to scoop some up at 550 but my alarm didn't wake me up. 100 would've been nice but i have no fiat in btce.
Never catch a falling knife; never panic sell. Hope you learned your lesson. Sorry, but it happened.

I don't know, you don't know, nobody knows. It's all a guess and the best guess at that. I have no clue when the fall will stop or what btc will be at x days, x years from now. I've lost money on the buys i've done but I'm hoping and expecting it to go back up long run. I'm not trying to make a quick buck but to start spending btcs once everyone starts accepting them.
MY 1100 buy crashed after and never returned yet. The 800 buy hit 680 and then came back up, the 750 buy was closest I've been to the lowest point. And the 550 alarm I set, was just that, an alarm, but i didn't wake up to see that. That would've been very close as coinbase hit 544. We play the game, we sometimes get burned, but never panic sell in the process. You don't lose money unless you sell.
Who knows what btc will be later; $1 or $10000. Either way, don't play with what you can't lose.

Yeah same here, just tried booking something. I guess we need to give them some time to update...

How could you not understand? It's part of human nature to freak out when something doesn't go as planned. 'But bitcoin prices were supposed to go up not down!' Then they think it might be another crash and just all panic sell mostly because 99% of them have no idea about any kind of market. This makes the other 1% very happy and rich.

Your luck is horrible? I thought the 860 this morning was gold. I bought in at 875. Then i see it drop to 650 after work. Puke. Oh well, in it for the long haul.

This man is a wizard!
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:06:15
 Lucky you. I  bought 10 at 850 this morning :(
@_date: 2013-03-20 17:04:51
Too late everyone, go home. I bought all 8!
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:11:44
Yep losing money but want to see where its going.
I bought a couple hours before this big crash thinking i did well at 850....nope 650 would've been perfect, but hey. It has to go back up at some point!
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:28:30
Hey that's what i have! 27k -&gt; 12k at one point last night, thankfully it's going back up. My break even point is 25k.... -_-

Damn, still not verified on MtGox, bought some last night on localbtc for 69! Already had a fair share in at 48, but damn that hurt lol.
It won't go down much further as buyers will scoop them up. I wish i could right now :(.
