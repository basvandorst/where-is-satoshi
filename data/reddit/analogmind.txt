Honest update
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:44:56
there it is! 
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:51:00
Can't deny that I feel the same as OP... but don't think there are any real viable alternatives. Lightning Network looks promising though, but I'm not sure the root idea of bitcoin as decentralized store-of-value/currency/whatever is supported by a lot of people currently in the crypto space...
@_date: 2018-01-24 10:41:39
Are there less people sending transactions through the bitcoin network? Or is segwit getting traction?
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:46:08
Oct 13, 2016 -_-

All those futures products are NOT settled in bitcoin, so it's just a pure gambling product with the volatility of bitcoin as the uncertainty. Why does anyone even care? I could also start a futures product with some friends, but that doesn't influence the price of the bitcoin because add the date the contract expires, there is NO need to buy/sell any bitcoin at all.

send you some! Could you send to this invoice:

Had the same problem, try this shop: 
@_date: 2018-09-29 08:00:50
why not have their own cubitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:23:34
I understand now, not having the underlying asset is no problem because even if you need those 100BTC in 1 month, you will get it from the futures contract in cash, and with that cash you can buy the actual 100BTC. Don't mind my ignorance ;-)
@_date: 2018-08-24 18:33:03
So users will be repaid a percentage of the actual amount of BTC they had? So let's say I had 10 BTC on MtGox, I get 2,5 BTC?
Imagine the dumping that will happen after they are finally pay out these bitcoins....

"It is quite common in the financial industry to get alerts like these, and whenever we do, we automatically trigger to our fail safe position, where we increase our monitoring and heighten our alert system to make sure that we are covered," said RS Mukherjee, Technology Credit Union chief information officer."

Interesting and elegant concept. Doesn't mess with the legacy miners, just introduces a special transaction which only the miner of the block can add and thereby tacking a superspace block onto the normal block, in the witness data portion.

Got the answer here: 
"The fee includes a chain cost to sweep the funds out of the swap address
Currently the fees on testnet are super high due to a spammer"
@_date: 2018-08-21 19:00:50
Awesome! Works flawlessly! Impressed!
But ouch, I paid 0.02248800 tBTC to get 0.00001000 Lightning tBTC -&gt; that's a 2248% fee 8-)
Why is the fee so high?

You can also get bitcoin by providing a service to someone or sell something to someone. No fiat involved.
@_date: 2018-05-29 14:51:29
Cool! would you be able to also make a testnet-mirror site? Would really like to experiment with it and give you feedback.
@_date: 2018-05-29 18:13:39
I know but I rather test some error-scenario's and edge-cases with faketoshi's 8-D

who's making a website with a "# of bitcoin lost" counter on it?

So if I understand this correctly, this is an app that connects to a personal LND node?

Deflation at its finest!
@_date: 2019-02-08 21:50:30
Please enlighten me what a bounce is.
Also, proper reference to deflation. +1
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:10:44
or  ?
@_date: 2019-02-06 08:13:02
Increased inflation happening right here :-)
@_date: 2019-02-08 08:15:39
Deflation :-)
@_date: 2019-02-04 18:25:05
whoops, yes.

\[paranoid\] Maybe the big banks "helped" the creditor, so that they could buy bitcoins cheaply before the real institutional money is flowing in \[/paranoid\]

These are questions asked by a dutch MP to the dutch Minister of Finance, referring to this (dutch) article: 
@_date: 2017-09-27 13:29:46
Post from 2014...
@_date: 2017-10-19 10:16:26
I don't get this article. They say everything the private industry innovates, the government will regulate. How would they regulate bitcoin if you don't convert it to fiat money? 
Note that bitcoin has no intrinsic value, just like fiat money, it's only society who gives value to it (in the form of military backing and primary human needs like food and shelter from the elements). It's a really simple equation
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:16:22
Good point!
Let's create some hype around a reddit-bitcoin fork, maybe exchanges will list it!
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:11:31
Great idea! Why not?
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:04:03
Forking is a fundamental right for everyone. There is nothing wrong with that. However, why reputable exchanges do let these forks come into existence on their platforms, beats me!
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:37:40
This is great! I tried to pay through the LN route, but it said "no route found", even though I created a route to endurance.acinq.co
@_date: 2017-07-21 10:32:56
No I didn't, did that now though. Then I see the aforementioned bug where my balance is fluctuating. 
Also, are there any other LN nodes I could connect to you know of?
@_date: 2019-05-15 11:00:05
Why are you not spending bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-05-03 10:37:49
Nice idea, make sure to do some sanity checking on the wallet address...
@_date: 2017-06-10 15:01:06
Wow, 1 transaction equals (4*6 kWh) 24 kWh ? You could power one light bulb for 4 months for that amount of energy...
@_date: 2017-06-18 15:04:43
Good effort! Be sure to also add hardware wallets as an option to secure your private keys.
