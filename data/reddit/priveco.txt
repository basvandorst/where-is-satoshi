I understand your desire to have complete privacy for all Bitcoin transactions, but I'm pretty sure other people are holding bitcoin that they would just like to exchange for real goods and services.  Since what I do isn't illegal, and since we don't have the time or expertise to process the transactions ourselves, I'll argue that Bitpay is pretty good for us.  It isn't perfect, but it is pretty good.  
We are being honest with our customers, they understand that the transaction is going through Bitpay.  
The advantage of using Bitpay vs. Fiat is that if customers are already holding bitcoin, they can purchase that way.  It saves the transfer from bitcoin to fiat (and the loss in value) then from their fiat bank to ours. Customers that are already in possession of bitcoin then save the amount they would lose transferring their bitcoin to fiat.

Why would Bitpay cut us off?  We went through a fairly lengthy approval process.  
As for BTCPay, I'll look into it.  When we wanted to accept Bitcoin we only had the choice of three Bitcoin processing methods that integrate with Shopify.  
    BitPay
    Coinbase
    GoCoin
BitPay was the only one that was functioning properly at the time.

After reading the book Digital Gold about Bitcoin and its future implications I decided that my company should offer people the ability to buy our product using Bitcoin.  It took some research, and only a little effort, but it works.  If other people are considering accepting bitcoin, I provided some info on how we did it.

We are doing our best.  Unfortunately, we cannot all be experts at currency exchange, blockchain, and electronic transfer of funds, so companies like mine have to hand off some of the process to others.  I doubt that will change anytime soon for us.  We handle too many transactions to watch over each one.  Also, of all of the merchants I know personally, granted that is probably less than 100, I am the only one who figured out how to implement even this simplified system.  Asking us to tie directly into the blockchain without an intermediary isn't realistic.

I'm guessing these are used to transfer funds that are accepted by the sorta-legal drug dispensaries?

I didn't read that one, but I did read "Digital Gold". It was written by the writer from the New York Times that has been covering Bitcoin.  It was very good.
