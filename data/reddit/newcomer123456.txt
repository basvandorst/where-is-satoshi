This is not fud. I'm barely related to r/btc. I do think that Bitcoin Cash is as well unreasonable right now like keeping small hard coded limit for ever, when we have consensus/compromise to fully activate segwit and hard fork to at least those 2mb.

Thanks for explaining that. How about cons of SegWit, do you see any ?

1mb block with only LN will not be enough at some point, even those will be mostly settlement transactions. Additionally some people sending big amounts will prefer to do it on-chain.
Why do core supporters fear so much actually free market for people to choose if they want to use LN to buy a coffee and on-chain to buy a car, or LN to buy car and on-chain to buy a coffee. Keeping 1mb is simply forcing most transactions to be done with LN. That's all what it is. Forcing.

Do not demonise hardforks, Ethereum had many along their path and it is not problem at all, unless it's robbery hard fork.
It wouldn't be a problem if this constant would have been replaced be adaptive solution years ago. We wouldn't have this war today.

Hardfork was not root cause of this. It was simply too much rush with releasing pre-alpha software, like evm and solidity.

 How can you refer to this 
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:33:55
That's reasonable compromise, however it's stupid to put another constant hardcoded value. Why not implement adaptive block size ?
If LN will be able to provide cheaper transactions, people will use it for smaller transaction. It's nonsense to force people to use less secure protocol. I know blockstream got ridiculous funding from nasty people, but let's keep it straight and honest.
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:43:28
Are there any security threats in SegWit itself ? 
For me skipping input validation does not sound like a good thing.

Lifting up block size is reasonable. It had different purpose. Reasonable way to scale is non-existing block limit (soft, enforced by each miner individually) along with solutions like LN. LN will offer economic incentive to use it for smaller transactions.

I agree as well that it should have been pushed as hard fork. But i do not understand why this proposal is about putting another hardcoded value ? Why they didn't pick Adaptive blocksize solution, regulated same way as difficulty which is pretty reasonable solution. Or simply allow miners to set their soft limits if they want to produce 10mb blocks or 1mb blocks. That would end up this war which only brought problems to bitcoin space.
No block limit does not mean that Segwit and LN can't be introduced which will have economic incentive to send smaller transactions over it.

Why limit miners ?
Why miners would bloat up the chain ?

segwit2x 89%
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:32:40
"Keep dreaming" - So basically you are saying that hardfork won't happen, even that majority agreed 85%-90% to make hardfork ?
Either way, what is bad about hardfork ? If it's not about altering someones balance, then it's fine.
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:04:57
Hey, but they didn't get that funding ? Isn't that conflict of interests ?
Kindly, refer to my argument.
