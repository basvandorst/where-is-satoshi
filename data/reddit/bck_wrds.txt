When is anything from the huffypost anything but sloppy? You would do better reading tea leaves in a cup, that way you get more accurate information AND a cup of tea first.

Thats not what fractional reserve banking is mate. They cannot create coins, its what the block chain prevents.

Yep now we have worthless paper that can be printed at anytime. That will never go badly.

Bitcoin is a very very long way from being a threat to 'their' money supply. Your talking a global daily trade of 5 trillion in fiat and bitcoin? Not sure what it is, a billion or so?

I've personally yet to be convinced by either segwit or BU. I do think however there is a middleground here. Neither the users or the miners can exist without the other.

So they create the capability for the network to operate but fuck them bitches. They get no say?

Safe to say no as I am unfamiliar with the term. I have literally just opened the program and watched it do its thing... over a long time. What are you referring to?
@_date: 2017-01-18 00:46:32
yep its the latest version. Specs are i7-6700, 16GB ram latest windows. 
I just want to use Armory because it seems to be a safe and trusted way of storing my bitcoins

currency is about pairing a token, USD, BTC, gold etc to scarcity. Or another way of viewing scarcity is the expenditure of effort, work. Its why BTC has proof of work. 
Our paper money (soon just to be digital due to the increasing move away from physical) represents labour. What it is is different, its actually just debt, but that's separate.
