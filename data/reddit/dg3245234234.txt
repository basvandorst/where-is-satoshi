"Once I have my panels set up" &lt;-- right there, and replacing it again in 30 years time or before if there are any accidents. A typical home solar setup might produce less than $100 of electricity per year, over a 30 year (avg solar panel lifespan) timeframe that's only $3k of electricity you're saving.. you probably paid a lot more than that for the panels and installation. The funny thing is that a lot of that money you paid for the panels and installation went to pay for the oil needed to mine the materials to make your solar pannel, transport them around and drive various staff to/from work - so even from an 'environmental' perspective less oil would have been used if you'd just bought electricity from the grid.

it's mostly the same money being moved through a bunch of different addreses.. I doubt there's any purpose for this other than to create a large block...

yes. even just depositing into and then withdrawing out of an instawallet account will probably give you coins that are unrelated to the ones you deposited.. 
or at least, it might.. it just depends which inputs instawallet uses to create your withdrawl.. you could (in theory) deposit money into instawallet, transfer it inside instawallet between a bunch of different instawallet accounts and then withdraw it and get the exact same coins back that you put in.. it's entirely down to instawallet which input transactions they use to create your withdraw payout.
If you're worried, probably the best thing to do is check the taint of the coins you get back and repeat the process until it's nolonger tainted with your input transaction.
You could also do the same thing on any of the other online wallets that use a shared pool of bitcoins (any of the exchanges or gambling sites) that way no one entity posesses all the transaction information necessary to follow the chain back to you.
