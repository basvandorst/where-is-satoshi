You live in a funny world if you think this will make Ethereum  useless.

Tims description of automatic payments based on contribution level sounds awfully similar to uJo. Only he's saying it will be w btc rather than ether. Either way it's a much more efficient way to distribute profits.

Merged mining is a terrible way to increase scale. You're right on with the loss of security in this type of situation.

If you read the rootstock white paper and actually try to digest the logic you'll understand that there is zero chance a solution that promises all those things will come out in 2016. Really it's a rip off wannabe of ethereum and I'd be very surprised if it is successful

Federated - multiple parties have write access. No one bank. Can employ a round robin technique and limit which nodes can create which blocks

Nothing personal but I'll vehemently disagree. I've yet to meet a banker who plans to use Bitcoin as a means of settlement. They will build their own systems. In theory bitcoin could work, but it will not be used in practice 
@_date: 2016-01-11 00:43:09
Incorrect. They absolutely will work together. They'll build something akin to the swift network which will be much faster, more efficient and less human element required

Unless you want to completely change what Bitcoin is it will need upgrades to all for any type of smart contract functionality. This includes new op codes. It will not run side chains without these upgrades. 
@_date: 2016-01-12 12:32:30
To be determined. But something created by the banks for sure. 
@_date: 2016-01-04 05:03:15
He has no rhythm. 
@_date: 2016-01-11 00:44:17
None of the private or federated chains are using mining
@_date: 2016-01-04 17:18:42
Ethereum isn't the problem. Bitcoin doesn't have the op codes to allow proper side chains into ethereum. Check out btc relay. 
@_date: 2016-01-12 15:22:32
A bankcoin isn't going to be subsidized. It's just going to be a representation of a real world asset held in custody. I doubt the banks are going to try and create a coin to compete with bitcoin. That would be an abject failure. Instead they will just use a representative token that has much less expensive settlement properties over legacy systems. That is all. 
@_date: 2016-01-11 00:50:23
I agree it's the most secure, most resistant and most difficult to break. That being said if they build a system they deem is "secure enough" then they will use their own. Especially since you can't write the smart contracts they want in need in Bitcoin. Not unless you use a system like ethereum and side chains (btc relay) to the Bitcoin blockchain 
@_date: 2016-01-12 12:57:38
You don't have to take this personally. I too am a fan of Bitcoin. I'm just letting you know the banks will not use it as the rails for any transfer. They will create their own closed system. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 09:11:23
If the only reason you're staying strong is immutability you may want to rethink the way you invest. There are other projects out there with an immutable blockchain that are not struggling with bitcoins problems. If you want to hold your bitcoins id suggest focusing on other aspects - such as the network effect and first mover advantage. Along w the amount invested in building bitcoins infrastructure.

I imagine multiple stable coins for an international platform. For us interbank settlement pegged to usd of course
@_date: 2016-01-12 12:31:54
It's really not available with the current state of bitcoin. 7 tx/s will not help any FI. I'm just letting you know they are not interested and will not use bitcoin. Bitcoin has serious scalability issues and the pseudo-anonymous nature is not desirable to banks. If they do not know who is securing the network they will not use it - it's that simple. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 19:30:00
Seems like ethereum is running with way fewer problems than Bitcoin right now
@_date: 2016-01-12 17:45:31
I'd agree that it's not money. Just a tokenized representation of an asset. To call it irrelevant is a mistake. Permissioned chains do not need mining - only specific users will have write access to commit new blocks. This type of platform will save money for the banks in all aspects of interactions with multiple parties. Most of these systems are not competitors to Bitcoin - especially not on the monetary unit side. Many bitcoin maximalists believe that Bitcoin will be used as the settlement system for banks - this just isn't the case. 
@_date: 2016-01-11 03:15:48
It'll be a coin the banks agree on and will be pegged to fiat. They are not interested in the blockchain for its currency component. They just want to use it as the rails for transfer. 
@_date: 2016-01-11 00:52:35
They are investing in blockchain solutions not tied in any way to Bitcoin. They do not care about Bitcoin 
@_date: 2016-01-11 00:43:50
They don't want or need people to use theirs. They just need each other to use their platform as the rails for interaction and settlement berserk different FIs
@_date: 2016-01-11 00:40:58
First those aren't all banks. Second none of the banks have any desire to use Bitcoin. They are going to use a federated chain - most likely built with the EVM
@_date: 2016-01-11 00:47:02
How could you possibly guarantee that when all the banks have come out to blatantly state they will not use Bitcoin. They will use a coin for settlement. It won't be Bitcoin tho
@_date: 2016-01-11 00:46:14
If you create a more modern sql database that allows multiple parties across organizations to write in a trust less manner then that is a huge win
@_date: 2015-11-15 02:30:47
Nicks speech was very well received. His background knowledge of the space is absolutely fantastic and enlightening. It's also quite telling that he's building his new offering on ethereum. The man who invented smart contracts is opting to spend his time brining value to this ecosystem - definitely gives comfort to many out there who were unsure of vitaliks vision. 
@_date: 2015-11-14 16:31:09
Szabos two projects in the past year are both built on the open ethereum blockchain. He's clearly a supporter and believer in Bitcoin but at the conference he made it very clear that actual applications that utilize the promise of a blockchain will come on ethereum and not Bitcoin.

You don't need a Consenus formation algorithm in this scenario. It has substantial uses. Especially if it runs the same vm as the public chain it wants to inter operate with. This is why so many public chains are forking the ethereum virtual machine.

This is horrible logic. So many people suggest if we can only get x% of y market we'll be super successful. 5% is an enormous number here.
