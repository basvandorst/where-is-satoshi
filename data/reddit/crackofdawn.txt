By this comment I'll assume you've never owned a house :)

Customer service is out of the park too.  I have 5 checking accounts, savings, auto loan, 3 mortgages, credit card, money market, 5 mutual funds, a 529, brokerage account, IRA, Roth IRA and of course my auto and homeowners insurance with them.  Never had a single bad experience in the 17 years I've been with them.

It's not presumptuous at all.  I guess we'd have to wait to see if OP responds that he *is* factoring in some sort of monthly expense for the house into the savings but I would be willing to bet not, especially if it is his first house.  Also, *every* house soon requires repairs.  Doesn't matter if your house was built yesterday, things break or need fixing or need updating or need to be dealt with.  Air conditioner filters, lawnmower/trimmer gas, etc.  Things you wouldn't even think about that you may need at some point.  Example in my current house we have a lot of greenery (trees, bushes, etc).  So at some point after we moved in I was faced with the decision of either paying a crapload of money every 1-2 months to have someone do all my landscaping, or buying a pole saw, a wood chipper, and a chain saw to manage everything.  The only other option was letting my house become a jungle which would be 100x more difficult to manage a year later.
These types of things new homeowners don't think of, and the expenses add up quickly.  I could be wrong, OP could have thought of all that, but I'd be willing to bet money he didn't.

TBH I didn't even realize I was in I stumbled into the thread from @_date: 2014-10-17 03:47:11
My IRA with them is a rollover from a previous 401k and is invested in one of the target retirement year funds that USAA manages, basically the same thing as a normal 401k target-retirement fund.

The point is there shouldn't *ever* be a need to choose.  It should be HTTPS and no password in the URL, period.

Drawer breaks?  Costs money to fix. HVAC stops working?  LOTS of money to fix.  There is ALWAYS something that costs money to do when you own a house.  Paint starts peeling.  Floors need to be replaced (new carpet, or whatever).  Maybe you have a dying tree in your yard that you have to pay to have removed.  Even stupidly simple things like plumbing issues (I can't count the number of flappers and float valves I've replaced in my toilets over the years) add up fast.
Even in a small house, $200/mo is probably a low estimate for his extra expenses when averaged out over the course of a year.  If you DON'T fix the things that break over time, they will (a lot of times) be much more difficult or costly to fix later and will HAVE to be fixed if you ever want to sell the house or want the house to retain its value.
