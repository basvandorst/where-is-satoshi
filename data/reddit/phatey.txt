Retail store owners are intrigued with crypto and will want to start accepting it soon..

The FOREX market exchanges 5.3 trillion dollars a day, of people wanting to earn a quick buck... :D

Most economists are completely useless.

My guess is little to no effect.

If you were investing in stocks the board would have issued more shares by now...  If this were oil they would be drilling in Canada...   What you are witnessing for the first time in your life is an asset that doesn't have a manipulated supply.  All the sudden big money is getting in and they aren't finding coins available to purchase because they can't create a supply for themselves to buy cheap.

The US retail investor is a small part of this thing, and is most likely going to be completely unaffected.
@_date: 2017-02-10 14:19:56
The fact that you are taking this discussion seriously is lol

Develop a quantum computer and mine the available bitcoins faster than anyone else.

This short squeeze is just getting started too :)
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:54:14
Lol that's cold.

HAHA SUCK IT DOWNVOTERS WE MAKING MONEY OVER HEREEEEEEEE :) :) :) :) :) :)

The value of the dollar as decreased steadily since the creation of the federal reserve in 1913, long before Bitcoin.  You own stocks, they will issue more shares.  You own oil, they drill for more when price goes up.  All supply side manipulation.  That can't happen in Bitcoin.  That's part of the reason its so beautiful.  You think we've gone parabolic?  You ain't seen nothing yet.  50BTC moves this market, that ain't shit in the world of high finance.  If your salty now, I can't wait to see you at 100k, 1Mill BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:48:44
Dude the USD bulls/BTC bears are coming out of the woodwork now that we're crossing historic 10k.  I doubt these people have any exposure to BTC or have ever taken a basic economic class and understand the nature of the USD or BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:23:17
The funny part is they think there is a possibility they take over BTC.  Like early adopters don't give a fuck about centralizing our currency, merits a big LO FUCKING L.  Thanks for the dividend, assholes.
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:46:30
LOL if one day Zimbabwe &gt; Lichtenstein.  BTC world currency incoming if so.
@_date: 2017-09-27 14:54:08
We all know it is fiat that is the scam.
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:00:38
Because fiat is junk and Bitcoin will always be the oldest and least volatile of the decentralized currencies.  Eventually nations will adopt it as a reserve currency, flourish, and one day the whole world will use it as a reserve currency.  There is nothing better than Bitcoin for this purpose.  
inb4 muh altcoin.  No, Bitcoin is king, but there will always be alts around.  
inb4 gold.  Gold will be mined from outer space in the near future.

Can we get a list of exchanges that don't support 2x?
@_date: 2017-09-20 15:00:56
We did get a good test of their authenticity when BCC split and everyone pulled their BTC out.  
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:54:25
This article explains the situation better than I can. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 17:17:18
I'm not alarmed.  I doubt their nefarious plans succeed because bitcoin investors are too smart to let their coin become centralized (in a sense).  Should they succeed, there are many other coins that will appreciate because of their decentralized properties.  I love bitcoin, but if assholes take it over I'm not above switching to mainly LTC or something.
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:07:51
I'm referring to BTC which is currently largely classified as a decentralized currency. B2X is largely considered centralized.
@_date: 2017-09-30 01:29:48
Just..  wow.
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:15:20
Most popular answer is not on an exchange but that's where I'll be keeping a lot of mine because I want to sell the B2X right away and beat everyone who has to transfer theirs onto an exchange and then sell.
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:14:44
For a rational market participant (someone who holds currency) it will always make sense to be in a decentralized deflationary currency.  Inflating the supply will always devalue existing units of currency.  Also, humans have never been able to allocate the created money ethically.  We have no clue where all the money that the federal reserve creates goes, more than likely Wall street.
There is always a price on everything and the market will always price things perfectly, ceteris paribus.  In other words, even if Bitcoin were the only currency, I still have a mortgage, car payments, etc that need to be paid.  I still have to feed my family and they can't eat Bitcoin.  
In short, people are hoarding Bitcoin now because we have fiat to spend.  If Bitcoin were the only currency they would spend it just like anything else.

Any coin you create will never be as old as bitcoin and will always have more volatility.  Therefor, it will never be as suitable to use as a reserve currency.  If you create a currency and manipulate it to be less volatile, you no longer have a decentralized currency and market participants will always favor a decentralized non manipulated currency.  Monero will NEVER be a reserve currency for a country, it will ALWAYS favor a country /  world to use bitcoin as a reserve currency over ANYTHING else, future coins not yet created included.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:13:24
The black market adopted it first, it's fair and works.  I could forsee the US trying to regulate it, but as far as a global scale the rest of the world seems to embrace it which puts US in a tough spot as a reserve currency.  Either way since bitcoin is the most common "virtual currency" around the world and is open source, it's hard to see any competitors because there isn't anyone profiting from the bottom of all this.  The value is in the scare resource.  The US doesn't even report money supply data because they print so much of it and give it to their friends the bankers.  The skepticism surrounding the bitcoin will provide plenty of fuel to the fire because despite the coming hype, no one will be able to "print" more bitcoins to meet demand.
