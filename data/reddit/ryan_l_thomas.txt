I love this community.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:15:28
Considering it's down 12% since last year, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

If she just claimed to do it through BTC she's lying.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:02:22
And now we're looking at 16k
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:18:28
Seems risky, but basically all my assets are in this now. Got nothing left to lose.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:18:00
I aim to please.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:07:36
Andreas recommends it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:23:13
I mean, I've diversified my portfolio since then, amongst several asset classes. This was just a big plunge I took that got me started.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:21:53
Yeah I broke the cardinal rule, but I saw an opportunity and had to pay rent.
I withdrew my principal already. Just took a massive risk and lived.
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:35:16
This was well worth the read. Thanks!

Yeah I mean it was decisive. Did some test transactions at 15% or so, then when I saw a chance I just went all in. I pulled back half my principal with each time it gained that much. So yeah, like it wasn't like all in one buy, no stop loss, kinda thing.
I just realized that the only leverage I had to make something substantial short term was to increase my holdings.
Looking back. Would do it again, with half of my initial investment, to just account for uncertainty.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:02:47
Quit selling!
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:24:10
Guess I could've clarified.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:13:34
Sounds like you were looking to panic sell.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:02:25
I do wires and they're flat rates, also depending on your bank processing.
What should've been at most a day became a week to deposit, granted after I made my wire, Coinbase put up a notice of wire delays in their account section.
In a perfect world, they're the cheapest and take about a day. But don't count on that turnaround time.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:05:15
really wish I could find a mobile app
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:05:47
Also, the other options are percentage based fees for direct deposit. If a currency moons, the fee does as well, proportionally speaking.
So my take; wire for max payout, withdraw for "assured" expedience.
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:42:00
I really think I wanna max what credit I have to turn a profit.
But that's so risky.

@_date: 2017-11-28 07:49:15
Same. I want to get more but literally don't have more money to invest.
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:18:49
Not when their gift becomes twice its value in months. That's considerate.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:51:13
You'll feel extra shitty if you cash out and it spikes. So idk, reach out. Couldn't hurt.
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:46:01
Unless you're out.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:46:52
Man, share a receive link or something. Hodl something so you don't cash out everything you know?
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:03:10
Probably the turkey...  or a lack of articles the googleverse is showing on the subject.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:49:58
Like copy a receive link to your btc wallet and share it on this thread. Idk man, people here are cool. You never know who's feeling a little generous on this rollercoaster ride up.
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:13:03
I mean, it'll work. But you still have a $2700 credit card bill... 
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:58:59
But you're still assuming you can buy dips and not be losing money in the process. Long term it's possible only with continual incline, which is a gamble in itself.
I have faith in this venture too, but not blind faith.
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:37:59
At this point, just hodl until you see a significant dip.
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:24:30
The minority of the crypto world is not of earth population.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:19:00
The issue is that Bitcoin is not stock, bond, or mutual fund. I tend to think of this as buying a collectible asset, and the goal at one point was certainly to have it as the prime means of exchange, however adoption is far down the line. Meanwhile, the fact is I can buy circulating collectible currency in the fiat sense, rare coins, and they can be sold based on varying value, and not treated as a literal cash advance, but the desire to do it intangibly is treated as threatening to the credit card industry.
This is just the fractional reserve banking system collectively retaliating against people choosing where they want to put their faith in currency. If you treated Bitcoin and others as the currencies they were intended to be, rather than an investment vehicle, this is a pretty fussworthy problem.
@_date: 2018-02-01 05:03:36
Don't click anything. Seems really fishy.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:50:02
I've done nowhere near that and I got the email.
