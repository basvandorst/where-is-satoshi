Need some help on Ledger Nano S
Okay guys. I just got my new Ledger Nano S and I have some questions that I hope you can answer.
I believe my exchange is non-segwit (Brazilian Foxbit) and I set-up my Ledger as segwit. Is just a normal transfer?
Will my wallet be available in whichever computer I plug in, provided the software is installed? Or do I need a setup for every computer?
Extra questions.
How do I recognize a segwit address? Is transferring funds okay between segwit and non segwit?
Thanks in advance &lt;3

What's happening that both BTC and BCH are going down?

Indeed, however Bitcoin can serve as support currency, backing other cryptos just like Gold used to back Fiat.
Bitcoin, for the normies, is understood as the same of cryptocurrency and most people doesn't know other cryptos exist.
Truth be told, we should stop fighting amongst each other and start creating a good decentralized currency system where everyone can have a base crypto and more than one crypto adopted in the entire world.
Of course, today that's still impossible. We must observe that we are inventing and testing this new technology. We are the brave explorers that are risking these unventured seas. However, in the not so far future, because of our ventures unto the unknown, people will be able to use crypto as currency.

So, I'm awating the arrival of my Ledger Nano S. Where should I store my bitcoins safely while this doesn't happen?

Fortunately we are in a position that we can still HODL for a while. Thanks for the tip.

Heh, I found out there are two in Sao Paulo, where I'm from.

How do they work? Can I get instant fiat?
