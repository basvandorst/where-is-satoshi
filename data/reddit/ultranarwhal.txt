the funny thing is, those books weren't written about Bitcoins. so if you think you have the economic prowess, then why not go into the actual stock market? oh right, because things are a little more complex than "Hurr, I'll just buy low and sell high"

if you're "reasoning" is that you "could have" been a bajillionaire if only you bought currency worth less than monopoly money years ago.....

I dont think he was being metaphorical

oh god, OP is clearly a 14 year old who's parents don't want to give him $10,000 to buy bitcoins
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:02:42

@_date: 2013-11-27 19:41:41
that is fucking exactly what you propose.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:01:42
What is this point of the OP? Don't spend your bitcoin cash unless you cash your bitcoin? 
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:36:25
what a great post OP. now instead of looking at all of the posts that say btc is $1000, I can look at your thread to see all of the other posts saying this. what a great thread OP, 10/10 would upvote again
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:38:45
what? you mean if I bought bitcoins back when they were cheap and sold them when they cost more I would make a lot of money? wow, you should write a book
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:46:45
Not really, but ok
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:29:27
you clearly don't know what you're talking about
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:39:41
what the fuck is that even supposed to mean? "Breaking News: China has over 1.3 billion people.....the average american watches 30 hours of tv a week." really makes you think........

no, it's about 14 year olds wanting to make millions with their parents money because they have Ph.D's in economis with their dissertation "Buy low, sell high. Dam im smart"
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:58:33
oh, you're a 14 year old who made millions from bitcoins? or a 14 year old who understands "buy low sell high"?
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:52:53
that must explain why BTC's price is so stable
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:36:19
I straight up don't believe that you retired at 24 by selling fireworks from your allowance money. your thread just reeks of people trying to exaggerate how much money they could have been if only everyone in the world gave them a dollar

as someone who has cashiered in retail, it's pretty understandable to have that happen every now and then when you do over 50 transactions an hour
