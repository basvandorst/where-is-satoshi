One day the Buddha met an ascetic named Peter who sat by the bank of a river. This ascetic had practised austerities for 25 years. The Buddha asked him what he had received for all his labor. The ascetic proudly replied that, finally, he could cross the river by walking on water. The Buddha pointed out that this gain was insignificant for all the years of labor, since he could cross the river using the ferry!

They haven't really.  If you examine the **ratio** of Metcalfe value to market cap, you will find that the ratio's "divergence" (from parity) is comparable to its divergence  at the end of 2010, and *almost* comparable to its divergence in the middle of 2012.  This is most conspicuous if you make a (log scale) chart of the **ratio** of Metcalfe value to market cap.  (And taking the geometric mean of the number of unique addresses used per day and the number of transactions per day (**EDIT:** excluding popular addresses) is an even even better estimate of the Metcalfe value.)

In *Appendix I* of [Willem Middelkoop's *The Big Reset*]( the author lists literally hundreds of different fiat currencies that have  gone to zero in the last three centuries.

Consider making a second chart in which the Metcalfe value is divided by the number of bitcoins in circulation, which will allow directly comparison with the bitcoin price.

Do you want [volume charts]( instead?  
I already fully admitted the "altcoin explanation" may just be confirmation bias.

Full disclosure:  I am a long-term Bitcoin hodler who currently holds a substantial amount of BTC; and I (currently) own no altcoins.  I received some of that Ethereum spam as well.  And it's definitely possible that it's a pump-and-dump and that the altcoins (especially ETH) will crash back to where they were.  
There reasons I posted this was that:
1.  I found it interesting that: whereas the previous 3 times when there was a high level of bitcoin-days destroyed coincided with the 3 previous times bitcoin had an all-time high price; this recent increase has no such all-time high price.
2. I was witnessing lots of desperate posts on by long-term holders who were selling their coins.  
3. I am concerned about my own bitcoins, because I believe that their will be no (large) rally unless the block size limit is lifted.
However I sense a lot of hostility by commenters here, who incorrectly assume I am here to pump altcoins.   In fact, I'd prefer not to own any altcoins.

Are you asking for something like cryptolization.com or coinmarketcap.com?

Because if the price is stagnant this means that the number of users is stagnant.

Probably because this phenomenon has been counterbalanced by [an equally large influx of clueless newbies]( so that the price has remained flat.

Yes.  The bitcoin --&gt; altcoin market has recently exploded.

Correlation or causation?  As you know, due to the anonymous nature of Bitcoin, I cannot prove it with 100% certainty.
