So everything that happens in the bitcoin ecosystem that you guys don't like is Roger or Jihan's fault?   Is that what passes for critical thinking around here?

So you guys are actively bragging that you're shady and deceitful?

Fake news.  Desperation intensifies.

It does not take a physicist to use basic math to see how big a blockchain can be.  If we went through with SW 2x we'd have roughly 4mb blocks.  If we had 4mb blocks for 10 years straight the blockchain would grow to 2TB.  Right now a Comcast connection is capable of downloading 2TB data in a reasonable amount of time.
On a 100mbit connection it would take 49 hours to download 2TB.  It's absurd to say that bitcoin could not handle Sw 2x safely.

Low transaction fees are an attack on bitcoin!

So this is idea of "bringing the community together"?  Lol this place could not be a bigger joke if it tried.  Apparently the only time this community can't be hostile is when it posts useless price memes 24/7.

This is what the community wanted.  Bigger blocks are an attack on bitcoin, remember?

Comcast could easily propagate 4mb blocks right now.  Besides, not everyone has shit tier internet like Comcast.  And lastly, we would not see 4mb blocks for years to come, so that's not a concern right now.

Haha that's called the economic majority, something last year this sub said whoever has that owns bitcoin.  Now when the economic majority decides which coin to use it's an attack on bitcoin LOL.  This is literally the free market deciding who wins but apparently you guys hate free markets now.  Just like miners used to decide the fate of bitcoin a year ago, now the miners doing what they want is an attack on bitcoin.  The only thing that remains consistent in this sub is anyone doing anything you disagree with is an attack on bitcoin.  
Hmmm!
