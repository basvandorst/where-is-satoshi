Checks usually expire in six months. A year old check would’ve most likely not been accepted at all.

I’m so sorry you had to deal with this - bitcoin, cash, or any other item loss - what you dealt with is plain old theft. Thank you for sharing your story and warning to others.
One thing I’d like to share with others is that I generally travel a lot and I’ve met my fair share of hosts and services who request to be messaged via Instagram DM or Telegram and the likes of these apps, and I always refuse. If we’re having a conversation in the AirBnb messages, then there are ZERO reasons for someone to write me IN THAT APP telling me to message elsewhere. Those who aggressively push for the move I immediately cancel my services with and move on.
Do good people use other apps? Yes, probably for its ease of use and access. Is there anything for me to gain (compared to the huge chance of loss)? Absolutely none. Do the apps we’re using work perfectly and have notifications built and set up in a way to serve both sides? Yup.

Beautiful idea! The pessimist in me is thinking “is he gonna give that letter to them when it goes down to $0.001 a bitcoin though?”
I’m HODLing too guys, please don’t downvote me to hell ����

Hi Nigerian prince, I finally found you again! Why haven’t you been replying to my emails!?

����‍♂️LOL. I loved the series as a kid, so it’s interesting to see all the changes in the world and how it could change that. Cartoons are usually timeless.
