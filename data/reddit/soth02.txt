I am assuming the simple case where there is just one bitcoin "market", ignoring the price differences between the exchanges.
There are price "tipping points" where a bit of selling or in other cases buying bitcoin could cause the price to collapse or spike respectively .  If someone was going to manipulate the market, you could load up on options, cheaply purchase strategic amounts of btc "ammo", wait for a tipping point, sell off, then collect on your options while the market is still moving.

If you look at  the bottom chart has sell orders as "9000 coins to $951".  I take that to mean in order to buy the next 1000 coins instantly, your end price would be $951.  purchasing 40k BTC would spike the price way higher than that.

I recall reading about a bitcoin options trading market opening a few months ago.  If you loaded up on put options, it seems to me that you could tank the whole market by selling off a few hundred BTC at a time, at current trading volumes.
