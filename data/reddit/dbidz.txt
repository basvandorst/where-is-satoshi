Any market would have to abide by their laws and regulations which are imposed by the nation or state the market itself resides in.

If there is no regulation, then to the smartest thief goes the spoils.

I know everyone hates regulations. They suck. This is a dog eat dog world, and most of us will take advantage of the next person if given the chance. It's in our blood. However, such regulations makes such actions slightly more difficult. A government institution in a developed country cannot perform such actions as gox and get away with it, at least not that quick and easily. I'm not sayin they wouldn't, I'm saying they can't.
So, sure, let it be envy or jealously that provoked such forewarnings. Just remember it is a genetic fallacy to assume that such warnings weren't valid only because the government itself would and has done the same at some past time or degree.

Oh, sorry. So I'm just curious, what happened to the value of bitcoin, how did people lose so much money and what happened to everybody's coins?

The point was to get you to ponder the answer to the questions to realize its relevancy to the points made out in the earlier posts. If you still don't see it, then I can't help you.

They warned about "currency status, investment risk and money laundering".
Can you relate those 3 things to the current crisis?
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:47:17
That is not true. Simply put, you are not equal with anyone who has more money and power than you do.

I feel regulation strikes the same chords as some laws. You don't really care much for something bad until it happens to you or someone you care about. 
I'm sure if everyone who lost money in the current crisis had a chance to go back in time and regulate the market in a way that would have prevented their loss they would in a heartbeat.

Great post. Wish I read it first.

Can you back up the cause of the drop? Obviously, there is a reason why the chart goes up and down. My point was the mt god crises led to a plummet of the price of bitcoin. 
Why did mt gox close?
But people DID lose their coins and money. Why?
Answer these questions and you will see the relevancy to the forewarnings made by the institutions. I'm not saying governments are all good and wouldn't rob you, but at least when they rape you up the ass they are decent enough to use a little bit of lube.

Fine. So they predicted such theft? Doesn't that therefore validate their warnings?
