Makes sense. Why gamble with your cash if you're not invested of involved in the business.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:30:27
Check out Bittrex.

It's relatively safe, but you may want to get into the habit of transferring whatever you've accumulated to a wallet (I use Bread). Set yourself a threshold, and when you get there send it away. May give you peace of mind knowing that you own your private key.

My wife is a special ed teacher and she's looking to purchase a horse and use it as therapy for these kids. She's been working 3 jobs and has been saving every penny she has for this. It would make her Christmas a special one, and she deserves it. I've never seen someone work so hard for a goal as her. Her third job is cleaning stalls at a barn so she can get free boarding  for a horse that she doesn't even have.

No fucking Duh! Cryogenic freezing for living humans need to happen like pronto. I'd be down for taking a 50 year nap and waking up a gazillionaire.

I hope you sold yours then, I'll take all the cheap coins I can get.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:48:01
Right. I know. They had to do it, but it's not like they didn't have enough cash to cover those expenses. I completely understand why they did it. In hindsight they should've kept it as an asset if they believed in the technology, that's all I'm saying.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:52:20
Good year to buy!
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:00:50
Any idea how many BTCs Steam would own at this point?? It's probably a lot of cash.
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:42:59
Coinbase does it automatically. If you don't want to have to pay a fee every time you transfer out just don't do it as often.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:32:27
Price is not as volatile, the transactions are wicked fast, and way cheaper network fees. Plus they shouldn't use BitPay.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:33:10
I'm sold.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:29:29
It's only gonna get higher. I say that based on absolutely nothing but hatred, and I'm comfortable with that.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:42:44
I'm avoiding this sub like the plague right now. I just came here to say this. I swear. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:11:00
I'm right there with you. Stuff of nightmares, but then I remember all the other dips and it calms me down.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:57:44
This is a good thing in the long run. What is not a good thing is everybody using the same exchange. That's a sure way to fuck shit up if things ever go south.

You and your hoe are the reason bitcoin is what it is today. Thanks, buddy!
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:45:27
Gotta love anytime anyone shits on Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:10:11
No. Can't wait. Dumping it all first thing and moving it to BTC/LTC/XRP. I think we'll be able to sell it as of January 1st?!
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:53:47
Right. That's why I used "should've." I wish I had a crystal ball... I bought my first coins at $10
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:24:22
^ man with the solution right here, folks.
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:59:20
At least I know what time it is.

Spending time with the family is important whether you watch sports together or not 
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:23:13
I thought that too until I realize anytime at this point is a good time to buy if you're planning on hodling
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:33:24
I hope they don't fuck it up
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:41:58
I certainly hope so. I need to buy more.
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:38:41
It’s gonna make 9000 go by REALLY fast
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:08:25
It’s going to be glorious. We should commission the HQ gif sub for this so we don’t end up with a shit meme. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:42:42
I make a point to buy at every ATH, and also every dip. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:08:32
Slightly. I didn't even have to set it up that way. It goes away during the weekends to give you a mental. :D
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:27:36
Yeah, but why?!
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:59:35
There are probably plenty of quality ones that were missed due to the overall hype build up on the top 3-4 ones. Let's give them a chance again. Plus I need to buy more.
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:25:48
To the stars, man. Get with it. Then to the galaxy, universe, multiverse, infinity and beyond or some shit... You just have to believe.
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:32:51
Good. Are you going to keep buying?
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:32:16
Sucks to be you.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:11:03
Yeah, and I'm Jesus Christ reincarnated. Strange times, indeed! People thinking the earth is flat, and giving the government way too much credit.
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:04:29
Could it be Amazon doing it?
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:55:24
You might as well believe in miracles at this point. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:21:27
Might as well start typing the $8000 post now.
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:36:06
I could buy a couple of those with the recent price increase. Cheers!

Reminds me of a Christopher Hitchens quote: "Forgotten were the elementary rules of logic, that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence and that what can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence."

Stock app, the one native to iOS. I deleted all of the preloaded stocks and added BTC, ETH, and LTC. Once you select the new Siri watch face it will show up automatically if you have the stock app installed on your watch.
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:59:17
Gotta learn to embrace the dips and buy a shit ton more when it happens.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:23:37
and what exactly do you base this bullshit on?
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:37:04
Doesn’t seem too bad for me, but I also don’t trade. Gives me a general idea where the market is. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:46:34
Do you see ads for the dollar or gold? No, you see ads for companies using it for a specific purpose and exploiting its use. This crypto craze has created a flood of scams and predatory business models using this new and somewhat unregulated tech to their advantage. Bitcoin will be fine and its utility will determine its value, not some shitcompany's marketing scheme.

Took me about 3 months to stop worrying and enjoy the dips. I now throw in a little cash at it every time it does...
