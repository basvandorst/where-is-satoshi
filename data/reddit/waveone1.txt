Any bitcoin ATMs in Athens already?

Haha. LOL. 
Works like a charm.

Thank you James and team. I love every single video you release. They are very good and helpful. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:13:14
Here are really great step by step instructions:
@_date: 2014-10-29 13:10:28
I disagree. Checkout the transaction volume. However, adaption will still take time. This is early stage still and bitcoin is not a "5 minutes, easy to understand". Regarding price, market cap is still tiny!(seriously, Whats App acquisition was 3 times the entire bitcoin market cap). Every sneeze affects the price and there are many manipulators. Not only that, many of the bitcoins used are recycled straight back into exchanges via Bitpay and such. So effectively more "artificial" supply than demand. We need merchants to keep their bitcoins and then buy stock with bitcoins (not convert straight back to fiat). This may still not be possible and will take time. In the more short term I hope there will be more demand than supply once ETFs hits.

That’s absolutely disgusting.
@_date: 2014-10-04 13:27:32
Agree. Misleading. I think the upper chart is in log while we know the lower one is linear. 
@_date: 2014-09-10 20:28:32
Wow great site. Thanks for posting!
@_date: 2014-11-22 06:55:11
If you do everything right (keys produced offline and then after kept all offline including computer and printer and stored well) and it's still somehow hacked then something is really wrong with the idea of self banking.
@_date: 2014-09-27 19:58:43
A proof to this!!
"Century of Enslavement: The History of The Federal Reserve."..
 The Fed is mostly controlled the big (private ) banks.

RemindMe! one year "2015 Predictions"
@_date: 2014-10-12 09:29:41
I wouldn't be surprised. He seems very intelligent and knowledgeable. If he is right, a global financial war is quite possible. Bitcoin would rise as an evolutionary great alternative.
@_date: 2014-08-24 10:19:54
Upvote Please!! Everyone should watch this. Important to the birth of bitcoin and why it should be adopted.
@_date: 2014-11-04 13:19:54
Keep anything you don't plan to use for a while in cold storage. I suggest you visit world bitcoin network and watch the videos on paper wallets and cold storage.
@_date: 2014-06-01 14:41:18
@_date: 2014-04-13 15:03:56
I am very happy with them and they prove to be serious over and over again.
Regardless, keep most of your coins in cold storage. They do not charge for BTC deposit and withdrawal. Either transfer back when you want to trade or keep inside only the amount spent for day trading. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 15:28:25
I understand your point. Thank you.
@_date: 2014-10-10 09:03:36
Will definitely buy a copy to support! Will do it on iTunes. Even if not paid in bitcoins and the producers get a lower cut, it will help promote it up on iTunes. Anything to help adoption!
@_date: 2014-12-16 15:34:05
First one owned is indeed exciting. Congrats. Unless you want to spend it, send it to cold storage. 
@_date: 2014-09-25 07:31:53
This guy has said so many mistakes in such a short interview. Low level shallow analysis. Downvoting.
@_date: 2014-03-05 20:19:57
Excellent site! Thank you for sharing.
Alternatively watch these two links:
1. 
2. 
People should learn to keep most of their coins in cold storage (while producing private keys offline) and only some, day to day spendable, hot on their devices. All these hacking reports are just a shame and feeding cheap sensational media headlines.
@_date: 2014-10-18 00:44:26
Great as always. Thank you!!
@_date: 2014-10-24 08:00:53
Interesting data is given in the interview (bitcoin not mentioned). 
@_date: 2014-10-10 08:58:35

@_date: 2014-11-08 08:45:39
Nice one.
@_date: 2014-10-29 11:08:38
And the price is crap (partly) because many of these coins are recycled right back to exchanges through Bitpay and such ("Supply" &gt; Demand).
@_date: 2014-10-18 00:41:33
Trust James to creatively make it both simple and interesting.
@_date: 2014-09-15 22:42:12
When you print the keys, the printer should not be connected to your home WiFi anyway. Should be offline and wire connected to your (forever again) offline computer.
However, would the printer memory be a risk when then reconnecting it online afterwards? 
@_date: 2014-10-12 08:38:48
You may find these interesting:
I don't argue that these are partial and possibly biased. However, I think he makes a good point!
@_date: 2014-01-10 11:47:29
Cool site dude! Too basic but I love it.
1. Please add more exchanges for more accurate stats.
2. Would be great if we could tap into history (data from previous day/week/month to compare present to past momentum… ).
3. If left on for hours, crashes my firefox.
4. If left on for hours, it stops working.
@_date: 2014-11-02 13:18:05
So this entire year price decline is because short selling option was enabled (Bitfinex)?
@_date: 2014-11-05 12:01:03
Good for you. Also, good time to buy I think (hope).
@_date: 2014-10-17 22:39:25
Scary stuff.
Aside of bitcions, what other forms of capital would you think about? Buying physical gold??
@_date: 2014-09-16 06:00:31
I see your point. So now if I still want to go the printing way, I also need to designate an old printer that will never be online again.
@_date: 2014-10-24 09:21:45
Yes! There is a very high sales pitch here (and the interviewer is as artificial as you can get - like a transparent sales man). I actually hope his predictions are wrong because if true, the world is heading for a financial catastrophe and people will suffer greatly. If true though, like Cyprus scenario (multiplied though), I see bitcoin play in strongly.
@_date: 2014-10-27 09:32:58
Check this out!!!
@_date: 2015-05-01 12:55:13
Love Andreas. However,  according to James D'Angelo video on 51% attacks, with current hash rate a state attack is very much possible. I am not a programer but, it seams one of them is wrong.
Link to video: 
@_date: 2014-02-09 17:41:03
Thanks. This is just about raising the right kind of awarness to bitcoins. Not about getting people to buy it.
@_date: 2014-11-23 09:07:22
Couldn't care less. It's open source.
@_date: 2014-11-10 13:38:21
1. Congratulations!
2. I did exactly the same 5 months ago. 3 BTCs. He is going to get the private keys when he turns 18.
@_date: 2014-10-12 08:57:01
May I recommend you read "The death of money" by James Rickards? He doesn't mention bitcoin but its future involvement seems pretty clear.
@_date: 2014-11-01 14:53:45
Your timing is good. Prices are low but consider might still go lower. Best advise I can think of: I highly recommend you look into cold storage (check videos on world bitcoin network). Keep MOST of your coins in cold storage and only some in your hot wallets. Unless you trade, never keep coins in exchanges.
@_date: 2015-05-01 14:32:31
Watch the video mate. If James is correct, governments if wanted too, can get enough chips (and pay for the energy consumption) to stage a mass attack that is way more then a single block (with current existing level of network hash rate).   
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:10:08
Great job Simon. You answered their questions very well.
@_date: 2014-09-13 22:14:54
Yes! My favourite too. Great introduction to bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-22 18:10:19
Good one!
I refer them to this (which is more or less the same).
@_date: 2014-02-22 09:18:11
HaHa! Good one.
@_date: 2015-08-08 08:24:46
His book, "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind", was a very interesting read to me.
@_date: 2015-07-06 21:42:56
I was there. I thought the video was very well produced. Good job. Looking forward to buy the 99 album when available.
@_date: 2015-07-03 20:49:37
Yes. Here it is:
@_date: 2015-04-26 20:09:00
Nothing new. Its exactly the same pattern on the graph happening for months and months. The real(!) reason is something else (Not that I know).
@_date: 2015-04-23 08:04:43
Indeed possibly result of 1st April "Greece/Bticoin" headlines. HOWEVER, if you look at this, a bail-in is possibly soon to happen. 
You do remember what happened after the Cyprus bail-in..

Can anyone recommend a reliable wallet for IOS please?
I have Mycelium on my iPhone and am quite happy with it.
I tried downloading it onto my partners iPhone only to find out its not available in the App Store anymore.

Nice lineup.
Will you release video recordings of the lectures?
@_date: 2015-11-29 15:22:19
Thanks for the suggestions. I find some of them interesting but none of them are suggestions for reading instead of ZH.
I am looking for a ZH like website but that is a little more balanced. Not like ZH which is "the world is about to end any day now".
Any suggestions?

(2:01) “Backed by the credibility of an anonymous hacker” ?? How about backed by math, not controlled by a group of corrupted “elites”..
