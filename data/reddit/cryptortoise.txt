You'll be laughing at these prices in the future and wonder why you didn't buy more. I thought $4000 was a ridiculous price at the time. Obviously we don't know what will happen for sure, however, we do know Bitcoin hasn't even reached the peak of its popularity yet. I see a news bit here and there and that's about the exposure people get. I'm curious what the price is going to be when everyone on the street holds a crypto wallet.

I'm definitely not against them. I prefer to be able to filter them out.

So I assume there are a bunch of developers working with the original code and committing updates as they go.
How many developers are there? And who decides to hire and fire of these developers?

I'm really confused about yet another issue. Why didn't the Bitcoin prices flinch at all even after the news hitting regarding Russia ban today?

What does the licensing and regulation mean for these exchange sites exactly. Do they mean the sites are required to answer to the government in forms of taxes? Or are there other obligations?

Thanks for the info. Much appreciate the input.

Mycelium Wallet works by giving you a 12 words recovery option. The Mycelium Wallet does hold multiple addresses with public and private keys for each of them however they won't give your the private keys. All those keys are recoverable by using the 12 words I mentioned earlier.
This is the part that actually confuses me the most. 
They call it a [HD Wallet]( (I added a link just in case) and it seems it's a bit different then simply getting an address and holding the public and private key for that address.
I wonder if I could use the 12 words to recover funds for both currencies?

I thought Bitcoin had the biggest chunk out of cryptocurrencies. Could you care to elaborate a little on your answer. I'm a bit of a noob.
