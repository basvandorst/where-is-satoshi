Can you explain why botnets would pose a problem in this situation? I find it incredibly unlikely a botnet could ever capture 51% once LTC gained any significant market share. Unlike BTC, LTC can be mined on general purpose computers, so that could get into the millions of machines mining if LTC becomes popular, while the largest botnets in existence are a few hundred thousand computers (and only a tiny fraction of those would have the GPUs needed to efficiently mine). Even more unlikely is that they would use this to disrupt the network when it is far more profitable to maintain the integrity of the LTC blockchain and make huge mining profits.

Because the economies of scale by companies like ATI allow production of efficient hardware at a fraction of the price of what it would cost to custom build an ASIC that would show even marginal performance improvements on a memory-hard function like scrypt.

If there is a botnet that controls 51% of the worlds GPU cards I sure haven't heard of it. Sure LTC could be 51% attacked now, but if it ever went mainstream it could not. Part of my goal is to dispel the idea that LTC and BTC are mutually exclusive somehow. Not all LTC users are made up of new people upset that they missed the BTC train. I actually reinvested my BTC profits from the last year into LTC and hope to see both of them succeed alongside each other.

Yeah sorry, I have no idea how to gauge the length of text from the small textbox you type into when submitting.

Oh cool, thanks.

I am not an expert on ASICs, I only know the basic facts about the hardware requirements of cryptographic functions needed to see why an ASIC is not a feasible route to solve memory-hard hashes.

Well whoever claimed GPUs could not be used for scrypt were simply uninformed about the purpose of that algorithm. scrypt was not designed to protect against GPUs but against custom hardware attacks. Neither CPUs nor GPUs are custom hardware, but general purpose chips that are manufactured at very low costs that economies of scale provide. Custom built hardware would simply be unable to compete with these economies of scale. Read up about scrypt on wikipedia or even better read the original paper by scrypts creator.

It fulfills the same need as Bitcoin (decentralized, free currency) but it accomplishes it in a different way. The value LTC adds comes from its alternative infrastructure, which provides further security and decentralization from solely relying on ASICs. Consider how many people own high end graphics cards vs how many will ever own Bitcoin ASICs. I am not trying to say that ASICs are a bad way to secure the network, only that there is value in diversifying the network infrastructure to include general purpose hardware most people own.

Scrypt was never intended to be GPU resistant. LTC was only not possible to mine on GPUs because initially there existed no software to efficiently employ the resources of the GPU. The difference with ASICs is at a hardware level, not software. You might be able to manufacture a computer with negligible performance gains over a general purpose GPU but at a prohibitive cost. General purpose hardware will always be economically more efficient than an scrypt ASIC.

The point is that scrypt ASICs are not feasible to manufacture at any cost competitive with general purpose hardware. Thus there will never be an issue with LTC ASICs pushing GPUs out of the market.

Even if an ASIC for scrypt is possible at some point, it won't be economically feasible until LTC is many times the current price of BTC. This provides protection for the network while it is still young and vulnerable to custom hardware attacks by large organizations.

Yes I'm sure they will be profitable. But they will not be able to achieve 51% of the hashing power needed to control the LTC network once it reaches mainstream adoption. How many ATI cards were sold last year?
