I'm well aware how the U.S. government works. the Last shutdown that actually went through was back in 2013. I remember this quite clearly because I was in the Navy at the time, and when the shutdown hit, I was deployed and the paychecks stopped coming. That means that my family back home weren't able to pay the bills. Yes I'm aware this shutdown is done for political reasons, but the fact of the matter is that there are lot of government employees (like I was at the time) weren't able to take care of our families. The only saving grace was that my bank (Navy Federal) offered to pay us upfront and just wait for it to blow over, but that took weeks to set up. My point being is that whenever our elected officials toy with us for some nonsense, they don't deal with the consequences... the rest of us do. I'm choosing to opt out of the financial system that is constantly used as a political football. As far as me being a moron, I never said I was a genius but I have the sense to realize the government that supposed to represent me is toying with my family.

has it been good and bad? sure there are issues with new technology, but on the whole, nerds are a net gain

The only candidate who actually understands Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general seems to be Andrew Yang. He actually has a spelled out policy position that he wants to encourage the technology the same way the internet was encouraged back in the early 90s. Yang 2020 Ya’ll

This was actually surprisingly accurate

I'm pretty sure I watch just the right amount.

Someone’s gotta make a video compilation of Joe Keenan (host of CNBC Squawk box guy on the left) from Bitcoin Skeptic to Bitcoin Enthusiast. I of the opinion that you SHOULD be skeptical of bitcoin when you first hear about it. It’s only then you can learn about what the technology can do.

I really like this! I'm just having a little trouble adjusting the widget sizes but other than that this is great!

I wonder if Zuckerburg will ask them how to get involved in Bitcoin

Sometimes I feel when I bring up the conversation of crypto, it feels like I'm showing off. Granted they think less now that the price has dropped but at the peak, I always felt like if I talked about it I was just rubbing it in their faces.

alright so here's my situation. I own bitcoin, but I'm currently full-time university student earning zero income. By that logic, I would be entitled to pay 0% capital gains?

right, but what kind of taxes are going to be required if and when I do decide to sell? I'm not planning on selling anytime soon, but I would like to know what kind of tax requirement I'll be in for when it happens.

I would love to live in a world where Ayn Rand is in charge and I won't have to pay any taxes, but that's not how it works. I'm not trying to change the world, bro. I'm just trying to live in it.

I wish I was. I'm a 31-year-old veteran currently on the GI Bill. Bought Bitcoin with my deployment money back in 2014.

I do truly believe that bitcoin will completely revolutionize the finance industry, however, I have people I want to provide for. My niece and nephew are about to become teenagers and I want to pay for their education. I also want to help pay off my sister's house. As much as I'd love to stay in the game I have to take care of my family.

Funny I figured the Jihadists would probably be more thankful of the U.S. Made military vehicles and equipment that they all use because the U.S. Military just left it around for people to take. If we're going to blame Crypto for jihadist funding we might also blame the military for leaving their shit everywhere.

the correct answer to when to sell is never.
