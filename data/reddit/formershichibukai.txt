You’re asking people on Reddit why a bull run happened last year LMFAO nobody knows. It was probly cause of a meteorite or for the harsh winter or because of Chinese New Year and Goldman Sachs Bonuses. Right now there are Cboe futures that manipulators are suppressing the price for. There could be a million reasons this is obviously your first day. Dumb ass.

Wow wtf.

Are you stupid? He’s saying the price of BTC was already rising last year and that Consensus was irrelevant. “Who was pumping Bitcoin” are you an idiot?

The only think about calling people week hands is that even if they pull out now they can probably get double the amount of what ever they have now by next week with the market falling like this. Market manipulators are causing the problem not the people reacting to it.

I’m officially at less then my initial input from December so I’m just going to pretend I got nothing in there but for those more lucky I would play the trend. Everyone yelling HODL HODL HODL people are now taking advantage of that mentality.
@_date: 2018-02-21 05:54:12
Exactly there’s has been nothing but great news pouring in they’re just trying to get more coins before it takes off.
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:29:35
Youre obviously an idiot. Day traders create the volume that decide whether we’re in a bull or bear market etc.  the point here is about taking losses that aren’t accounted for people take losses for bitcoin every day dumb ass. Go get neutered People like you shouldn’t be allowed to have children.

Look around people this petty post : OMG 43%???!! YOU MEAN 62% !!! Got 200 upvotes the market is going down because of fud. The community has been polluted with THOUSANDS of “I’ll never buy crypto again” Abd they’re finally leaving the market now all that’s left is the institutional money etc to flow in Korea’s back and after tax season were off to the races
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:56:22
I can’t believe I’m actually responding to trolls but either you are truly an idiot or you’re retarded. You literally constantly post baseless bull “I expect it to go down to 5k” good for you congrats sell your bitcoin then go jump off a cliff when it reaches 100k. You clearly only got in when the market surged so no when it recovers like EVERY MARKET IN THE HISTORY OF TIME DOES, you throw your panic off on every else. Every one just down vote this person into oblivion. No one needs to see these be posts

“The charts are saying that we are going lower. If I'd be you I'd cut my loses now. “
“All the bad news this week is still valid”
Exactly my point you’re talking out of your ass because you bought bitcoin in December and think everyone’s at a loss.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:05:50
This deserves its own thread ^^
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:07:41
Perhaps also you are not understanding what an investor is. People aren’t donating their money with no hope of return. People aren’t philanthropist that are going to throw their money into bitcoin and when the big businesses come in and short the crypto will say “ I was using it as a tool of exchange anyway who cares?!!”  Yes we invested so aYes WE WANT THE ASTRONOMICAL RETURNS THAT WE KNOW CAN HAPPEN. Go buy shit with your bitcoin while it’s at its lowest point of the year like that guy did with those pizzas. Genius.
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:08:04
Well for one...  I know isn’t the stock market. And regardless of how you try to slander daytraders( which create volume and are the reason ANY crypto currency ESPECIALLY BITCOIN is able to be as overvalued as it is.)
Me and anyone else who decides to day trade or buy a “shit coin” should be free to do so. Charging a fee for gains but not taking losses into account regardless of tactical planning is wrong and unfair. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:57:21
I went to do my taxes last weekend within a month it’s considered a wash because of people that might tactically try to do so.
@_date: 2018-02-11 19:04:39
After intense research it appears as if the bitcoin bear market is about to turn bullish.
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:50:08
Lie it was off by a measily 20% it doesn’t make a difference no ones going to run and buy bitcoin now because of that it didn’t change anyone’s mind just noobs nitpicking over short term loses that it has already recovered from
