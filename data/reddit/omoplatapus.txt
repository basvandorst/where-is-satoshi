Transaction fees too...

As an ancap, these are incredibly nuanced subjects.

Or a third party escrow service whose trust is based on their reputation.

OPEC can demand payment in OilCoin all they want, but they must ultimately exchange OilCoin for goods and services, and they cannot control the spending power of their coin which depends on how other people will use it.


I'm not really sure we're still talking about crypto currencies so I can't really say I know much about this.  I do know that many centralized electronic currencies have been taken down in the past but I don't know much about the security concerns about these type of networks.  Just that decentralization was a major step forward in currency.


But bitcoin has these features because it is a distributed network in which people are rewarded for performing transactions.  (or in the case of NXT, the transaction fees are higher to reward people for running the network).  OPEC would have to incur 100% of the costs of running the network, and at that point they have to weigh those costs with just relying on a bank to process transactions in fiat. 


Yes but they aren't the only one who sticks their nose in for a piece of the pie.

Always funny to hear a devotion to nonviolence described as "delusional" and making someone a nutjob.

Why do you think libertarians have a hard time understanding a very fundamental fact of banking?
@_date: 2014-01-07 06:53:27
Very cool.
@_date: 2014-07-01 22:51:05
If OPEC has faith that their coin can be exchanged for goods.
@_date: 2014-07-01 22:52:27
I wasn't too serious about my comment, but I do like to imagine that if Bitcoin holders become the richest class in society, maintaining the network would be their top priority.
@_date: 2014-03-14 21:12:06
Ya walrus mafacka.
@_date: 2014-05-25 15:52:47
Only if you consider Wal-Mart, General Motors, or Verizon governments too.

I'm really mad David Seaman didn't bring up bitcoin when he was on the podcast last summer.  If he did I would've looked into it and would have a lot more BTC by now!

There's no need to diminish the efforts of others.  Anyone who puts themselves out there to speak publicly about something they love deserves great respect, especially if they're introverts.  That said, IMO Andreas knows how to articulate the vision of the crypto-future better than anyone right now and respect is due where respect is due.
@_date: 2014-02-22 07:33:01
So all of the talk about contracts and DAOs, you're saying its not possible with Ethereum, or they're nothing special?  In which case that's more of an issue of your lack of vision than anything being a scam.  These are features that are in other 2nd gen coins...
Also, why should I listen to you and not other "CS" people like Andreas Antonopoulos? 
@_date: 2014-05-01 02:10:12
That's the point.  When you say "apolitical", you're saying "without government".
@_date: 2014-07-01 22:45:00


That would be the end goal for oil coin, but there is a lot of risk in getting OilCoin to that point.  The demand for oil will remain the same but not enough speculators might be interested in jumping into the OilCoin IPO in which case the market cap will be too low.  People argue that even Bitcoin's market cap is too low.  Also, the launch could fail because of technical failures like so many other crypto currencies, the network could face early attacks while the hash rate is still low, etc.
I like to think of something like Auroracoin where 50% are pre mined for the Icelanders, and speculators are given a chance to invest in the coin before the coin is distributed to the Icelanders.  If OilCoin pre mines 50% for themselves, they'll crash the value of OilCoin once their share of the coins enter the market.  In Auroracoin's case, its I think 1/100th the value it once was before it was distributed to the Icelanders?
Your other points are fair though.


Close to free transaction frees, near instantaneous transaction times, (relative) freedom from government interference are some of the other benefits they get.  
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:31:18
Ok, lets be serious for a moment.  What if we all pitched in, whether we're involved or not, and cover the 700k missing bitcoin?  Doing this will save our currency from crashing and will get us back on track for future growth.  There are an estimated 500k unique users, meaning we will all have to pitch in 1.4 btc.  Obviously we all can't pay for this now, but we can go into long term debt and pay this off in the long run (with our children) which will be easy once we get back to consistent growth.
No?  Well we did it for the banks, at gunpoint no less.  If it works for the US it has to work for us! 
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:54:10
Much much lower fees, transacting in a currency that is decentralized and can't be inflated to death, having a true free market of escrow services and thus not having to put up with government-backed banks with no incentive for good service and whose monopoly status allows them to extract as much money from you as possible, much faster transaction times, the lack of legal barriers and obstacles, a public ledger to settle disputes, and ultimately a system that is near impossible to cheat or hack.  No one can hack Target's database of bitcoin private keys because there is no need for that to exist, so it doesn't.

I was just thinking about making this same thread.

Can I like, have one.
@_date: 2014-03-11 09:06:57
That busy work translates to network security.  But if you are still put off by it, look into NXT.
@_date: 2014-07-01 19:35:59
But the value of OilCoin will only be as high as what people will be initially willing to pay for it.  If OPEC theoretically fixes the price of a barrel to a certain OilCoin value, and then they agree to cartelize and hold the oil hostage (which I think is unrealistic) until they convince customers to choose to pay that price rather than buying from other suppliers, then OilCoin may get out into the market but it would still need some level of adoption to draw speculators.  If they accept bitcoin they don't have to deal with the risk and short term loss of developing the mining infrastructure and speculator base for a crypto currency.  They get all the benefits of crypto and don't have to add any more risk to an already risky proposition.
@_date: 2014-05-01 02:06:31
Yeah, fuck those people well-versed in philosophy.
@_date: 2014-01-06 23:36:03
So, any clues as to how much you paid? :)
@_date: 2014-02-17 02:57:08
It is a processor but I don't really see how it's "central".  If you're unhappy with an escrow service you're free to go elsewhere in a free market of escrow services.  And I don't really see what other need there is left to satisfy, either you want to send money using an irreversible transaction or you want to send using a transaction that can be reversed by a third party.  Or you can even have contracts in systems like Ethereum and Nxt.
@_date: 2014-07-01 18:54:31
OilCoin has no value if they create it for themselves.
@_date: 2014-03-27 20:37:20
Once you go anarchy, libertarianism seems kind of silly.  The free market can take care of EVERYTHING!  Except personal security and community defense. Everything but those 2 specific things though!
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:54:47
Thats how bitcoin currently works, but that doesn't mean improvements will never be made.  Just as with the internet.
@_date: 2014-02-27 10:39:03
That poor, poor bastard.  I believe his personal issues go much deeper than bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-11 09:05:54
It has its positives and negatives.  All of that hashing power also makes it the most secure network.
@_date: 2014-02-27 10:31:14
My personal views on this are that its better to not enable the system by participating in it.  They will have as much success regulating bitcoin as they did torrents.  If the government is to be beaten and meet the will of the people it must be out-innovated.  The system they offer to change it we call "democracy" is a joke.

The fact that so many people have this belief is what allows traders to make money.
@_date: 2015-01-15 00:25:06
I admit I'm a novice, but what do you think professional securities traders are?  Pure gamblers?  Do you think technical analysis is complete bogus?
@_date: 2015-01-15 00:52:09
Are you saying the price of bitcoin doesn't exhibit the same patterns as anything else thats publicly traded?  As if human psychology applies to securities but doesn't apply to bitcoin?  Yes its a lot more volatile and traders/investors/speculators are a lot more emotional about bitcoin, but that doesn't mean the same patterns don't show up.  In fact the extra volatility and emotion makes bitcoin trading even more profitable for people who recognize the patterns.
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:32:19
tfw you realize the original anarchist spirit of bitcoin has left r/bitcoin for r/btc and replaced with normies.
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:41:04
I don't understand.  The only public figures that are allowed to talk about bitcoin are...who?
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:42:00
Ironically this is a logical fallacy.

lol.  Maybe in the same way that Reagan believed in personal choice in regards to drugs, or Hitler respected civil liberties.
Care to elaborate?
