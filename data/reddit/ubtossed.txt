Keep in mind that most people promoting other coins have an economic interest in those coins gaining value. Proceed with caution.

Yep, cost averaging through regular buys is a pretty good strategy when you have a bit left over from each payslip. Assuming a long term rise in the bitcoin price, the best strategy would of course be to put as much as possible into it right away.

Been using Bisq for small buys for the past four months or so. Never had a problem, except occasionally not being able to find offers for amounts under 0.05 BTC.
As long as you are the buyer there is very little the other party can do to scam you. The seller runs a higher risk of chargebacks, but it seems the escrow is working for now. Otherwise it would have quickly scared away the sellers.

They should rename their company to bc1broker then :D

Not true. I run lnd on Win10 connected to bitcoind on the same machine.
@_date: 2018-10-29 00:56:39
I have been buying monthly through Bisq for more than half a year, and through centralised exchanges before that. I don't see any reason to stop. Bitcoin is growing up really fast.

Until I need to spend them. That's the only way I am going to part with them.

It's a parameter automatically set by the network that specifies how difficult it is for miners to find a valid block. This is periodically adjusted such that the average time between blocks stays at 10 minutes even as the total hashing power of all miners changes over time.

I don't see how IPv6 would help with opening lightning channels between peers. Can you elaborate?

To dump or not to dump? That is the question...

When you say they are incompetent and inert (not disagreeing with you), I assume you think it's because they have no incentive to develop their country since they have all these natural resources handed to them on a silver platter by nature?

Louis Rossmann definitely seems like a trustworthy individual. I have followed him on YouTube for a couple of years now. He has some harddrive repair videos on his channel you could check out.

If only fiat &lt;-&gt; bitcoin volume would increase. Seems like it's mostly monero &lt;-&gt; bitcoin right now...

I have done that a couple of times, if there were no suitable bitcoin sell offers when it was time to buy my monthly fraction of a coin :)

Your title should have been: "Dear ethereum". No one uses graphics cards to mine bitcoin.

Since this is meant as a soft fork, there isn't really a legacy network. I guess what you are asking is: "Can I send bitcoin to an older type address beginning with 1 or 3 after it has been involved in a taproot type script?". The answer is yes.

They make it look like the only reason for the price surge is a local fear of the Argentinian economy. I always chuckle to myself when journalists try to simplify complex global dynamics down to a headline.

Until exchanges integrate lightning...
There is already Zigzag and probably others I don't know about.
