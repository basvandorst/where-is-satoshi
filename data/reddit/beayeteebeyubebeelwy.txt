Cool suspicion, bro. You seem to have a lot of unfounded suspicions and theories. 


Then surely you can support it with data? Show me the data, I'd love to go over it.


Maybe you simply don't understand what news affects price. May I suggest an entry-level finance class?


Negatory. I've paid attention to both and I disagree. 


I love this. It's almost copypasta worthy. I would make it your RES-tag if it were shorter. I'll just tuck it away for now, though. 
I think it's funny that literally *every single argument* you have formed is just your babbling guesswork. You haven't provided the tiniest shred of evidence; the **entirety** of your argument is "my gut tells me this is how things are".

...says the guy who is deleting his comments as I reply. Nice.
I could send you 1 bitcoin, and pay nothing for the ability to do so. The transaction fees in bitcoin are effectively zero.
You can hem and haw and do your best to ignore this fact, but at the end of the day, it is what it is: Bitcoin has basically-zero transaction fees.
This could certainly change in a couple of decades. But the reality is that Bitcoin transaction fees are just-about zero in almost all use cases.
Make sense?

@_date: 2015-05-06 21:15:19
Ah, it looks like you are confused on what the conversation is and is not about. Here you go:
First, claimed that Chinese daytraders are flocking in hordes away from Bitcoin (since January 2014). I  astutely observed that the data directly contradicts this story (namely, Chinese exchanges across the board have much larger trade volumes now than they did a year ago). admitted that yes, almost all data definitely contradicts his narrative, but that he can still construct some arbitrary fantasy in which Bitcoin is basically dying, and the data which he uses to support this fantasy is that "price decayed" since the ATH, which, he claims, indicates that:


I then observed that Bitcoin is still up 10,000% from a couple years ago (in other words, it is **now** worth $235... notice that no one is talking about any ATHs here), so that narrative doesn't really work that well, either.
At this point must have realized that he doesn't actually have a case, since he stopped responding. Then you poked your head in talking about how "CYNK is doing better than Bitcoin" for some reason. I used numbers to disprove your silly claims, and now you look a fool.
Hope that helps.
@_date: 2015-05-06 16:52:56
So where exactly is the evidence that "Chinese day-traders seem to have been losing their love of bitcoin gradually but steadily since January 2014"?

So your post can be boiled down to: "we're not in a bubble right now" then? 
Well, on that, I do not disagree. 


I'm not going to prove that Bitcoin is in a bubble. 
If that was your only point, why not just go back and edit your first post to say "Bitcoin is not in a bubble right now"? Your irrelevant references to metrics like transaction fees in USD do **nothing** to strengthen your point.
Goodness, if people were just more careful with their language... 
@_date: 2015-05-07 17:30:40
Here's the thing: your entire argument was that "volume on USD exchanges with fees has been stagnant/falling"... after I informed you that **mathematically speaking, this claim is entirely false**, you are saying "well actually the high volume sell-offs don't count, so just ignore all those numbers and the math that I don't understand".

You do realize that the price is up 10,000% in the past couple of years? 
Seems an awful lot like "most of the users who bought bitcoin" have kept a bit of those coins stashed away, especially considering that during this same period Bitcoin has been experiencing **greater monetary supply inflation than most currencies (e.g USD)**...

Don't worry. I'm not hodling any coinz - you can peddle your investment advice elsewhere.
There's plenty of "suggestive evidence" in favor of any theory you want to pull out of your ass. I can vomit up a dozen hypotheticals that directly contradict your own tale, and they all make the same amount of sense. The only evidence you have that Chinese are "flocking from" Bitcoin or "dumping it" is that the price has fallen. Interestingly enough, the price also fell after **every other bubble in Bitcoin's history**; did the Chinese cause those too? No? Just this time, then?

More importantly... you've devolved into some weird fantasy.
Stick to reality: what is *actually* the case, in the *real world*? The price you pay to transact in Bitcoin is **0**.

Brilliant work, Sherlock. You've done it again.


So basically you're saying "Even though all the numbers we have show that more and more Bitcoin trades are happening in China, *theoretically* it could be fewer people trading more often!"
Wow. Hard to argue with that!


Go ahead and keep trying to make the conversation about HODLING. I'll keep reminding you that that's off-topic.


Apparently what's hard to understand is the subject of conversation... you are having a **really** hard time with it.


What I dispute is all your half-baked theories that you're presenting as indisputable facts. "Anyone who is paying attention would agree with the bullshit I'm prattling on about! I am a much better authority than all those TA quacks!" It's entertaining, but certainly not enlightening.


Ho Lee Shit. You seriously just linked to a mediocre news article from 2013 as your primary "evidence"... putting your strong foot forward, I see.
Before you hurt yourself, though, let me just stop you in your tracks and clear something up: I'm not disputing that China's sudden surge of Bitcoin interest in 2013 played an important role in the price appreciation that year. It obviously did. 
Your final paragraph is largely a waste of words; I'm very much aware of how ridiculous any source of news with "bit" or "coin" in the URL is (with the possible exception of Coinfire)... I'm not sure why you're preaching about how unreliable these sources are, seeing as how I haven't brought them up at all?
But let me go ahead and ask you a quick question, since you're so convinced of your little theory that China controls the price so directly... why is it that the Bitcoin market prices have reacted immediately, **every single time an upcoming US Marshals auction has been announced**? Furthermore, why is it that after the initial sell-off, the week leading up to each auction has been incredibly stand-still stable, and then the market resumes normal levels of volatility and movement shortly after the auction is concluded?
It's happened three times, in exactly the same way. But I thought Western news doesn't have an effect on the market, according to you? Your theory seems pretty satisfactorily falsified, it would seem. Time to scrap it, like a conscientious scientist, and look for a new theory to explain events, wouldn't you say?
May I suggest a theory that *doesn't* adhere to radical one-end-of-the-spectrum claims like "China completely controls the Bitcoin price" and other nonsense? Something more like "both the East and the West have meaningful influences on the markets of Bitcoin"? 
Just a suggestion, to save you from potential future embarrassment.

If you're willing to say "PayPal generates income by processing payments" then you must necessarily be willing to say "Bitcoin generates income by processing payments" as well.

Where on earth was I ever talking about hoarding? You're the one who keeps trying to veer the subject away from the subject of trade volume... you know, the only metric that is relevant when it comes to assessing whether Chinese day-traders are gaining or losing interest in Bitcoin? You know, that one? Trade volume?


What's hilarious about this is that you use your own assumption, circularly, to try and prove itself. "Well I feel like China controls everything, so they probably controlled the price going both up *and* down!"

casts: **Desperate Last Resort!**

@_date: 2015-05-06 14:55:49
No, because the block reward has nothing to do with the cost of a transaction. It's a completely separate phenomenon at this point; you don't "include the expansion of the M1 money supply" when calculating the cost of giving someone a $1 bill.
The cost of mining **is entirely separate** from the cost of sending a transaction, and anyone who tries to blur the line between these two is either misinformed or deliberately trying to mislead you.
The fact is that you can buy 1 bitcoin from somewhere, send that coin across the world, and have the person across the world receive 1 bitcoin. You don't have to pay fees to transact in bitcoin unless you are sending a very small amount that has recently moved, or your transaction has an abnormally large number of inputs (see bitcoinfees.com)

The cost of the transaction for the transactor is 0. That is the fact of the matter. I don't understand how you are having such a hard time with this.
Are you having trouble sending transactions without paying fees? I'll happily take a look and tell you what you're doing wrong.
You're trying to lump in something that has nothing to do with the costs of a transaction, and call it a "cost of a transaction" even though it is not actually the cost of a transaction. 
Are you under the impression that you have to pay 25 bitcoins to have your transaction included in a block? You don't. You don't have to pay any, in most circumstances.

Oh, well try to stick to the facts here instead of making weird bad analogies.
I think the trouble here must be that English isn't your first language, so you're confused about verb conjugation here. 
The word "are" (or "is") is a present-tense verb. These words mean that *right now*, something is a certain way. So when I say "Bitcoin transactions are free for the transactor" that means that *right now*, you don't have to pay a fee or suffer some cost of transacting when you use Bitcoin.
You seem to think that the claim is "Bitcoin transactions will be free forever and ever" which is not the case. I never said that. 
So once again, in case you have forgotten: **Bitcoin transactions are free.** This is just a fact. A straightforward, indisputable fact.
And if you really want to cling to your bad analogy, fine: as long as no contract is signed, then yes, your internet subscription is free (for 6 months) if those 6 months incur you no costs. You might say "But it won't be free forever!" but if I wanted to, I could happily stop using the service after 5 months and 29 days, and never pay a penny for using that delicious free internet.
Hope that helps! If you ever need another English lesson, feel free to PM me.

No, that's not true. That was only the first half of your argument, which I didn't respond to. This was the part of your argument that I was addressing:


For the first metric, I pointed out that there is absolutely no reason this should be growing right now, and that even if Bitcoin were being massively adopted, this is one of the last metrics you'd see it reflected in. You ignored this observation, which is pretty funny.
For the second metric, I observed that it **is** showing growth. Your rebuttal was basically "Yeah but let's ignore the numbers for a moment, since numbers scare me!"

@_date: 2015-05-06 17:16:32
Your observation is valid. The original claim, however, is still just as bunk as ever.

@_date: 2015-05-07 15:28:22
You are literally **still** trying to talk about hodling. The **only** metric that shows whether Chinese day-traders are trading more or less is... wait for it... **TRADE VOLUME**. That's the exact definition of the phrase, in fact.

The same thing that makes most people dumb: a general lack of intelligence. I guess it comes down to the Nature versus Nurture debate; maybe you're dumb because your parents were dumb. Maybe you're dumb because you didn't pay enough attention to your elders or teachers. Honestly, you're probably able to answer the question of what makes you dumb better than I am.


Here's a perfect example of you being dumb. You're bragging about your business but it's not relevant in the slightest how much revenue or growth you've seen. I'm saying that **you selling soap doesn't qualify you as a moderator of this subreddit, nor not that your shitty soap business is floundering. Learn to read, guy.


I do find it funny that whenever I'm not talking about the downsides or upsides of Bitcoin at all, and am instead just talking about you being unqualified for a moderator position, that you keep trying to change the subject about "downsides of Bitcoin". Very telling, if you ask me.

You might want to consult a dictionary before talking about what things are or are not, "by definition". Scams are not "by definition" illegal. Plenty of scams *are* illegal, of course, but plenty others (e.g. MLM schemes, Ethereum, pump-and-dumps) are perfectly legal in other contexts. 
Of course, it's no surprise that you're making up definitions and pretending like they are the real definitions of words.

False dichotomy, actually. But hey, you're a Buttcoiner and I know how you guys don't do so well when it comes to math or logic. 
Most people could have gotten in before 2013 (and have profited), and adoption could very well be increasing. "How is this possible?" you ask, utterly befuddled. Well, see, it's easy: there were **5 years** that Bitcoin existed before 2013 wherein people were "adopting" it, and there has only been about **a year and a half** since then. So even if adoption is increasing/speeding up, as long as it hasn't increased by more than a factor 333% in the past year and a half, there is no contradiction.

Yes, selectively incomplete. As in, it wasn't a case of data simply missing off the beginning or end. It was a case of **tens of thousands of arbitrary trades within the time intervals that the dataset covered being conspicuously absent**.
Do you understand what that means? The data was edited before it was released. At minimum, trades were deliberately deleted from the dataset. That's **at minimum**. 
I have the feeling you don't understand what it is that I'm telling you. But that's ok, you're a Buttcoiner who claims that he owns hundreds of thousands of bitcoins.... you're not exactly the brightest person here.

No. This was the first comment of yours that I downvoted, because it's clear you're trolling at this point.
If the patent office simply allowed you a place to publish your ideas/innovations, no one would use it. It would be pointless, and offer no benefits to anyone. That's all Factom purports to do.
The reason why a patent office is useful to anyone is because it has legal standing. *If and only if* you file a patent through such an institution, and it is approved, you have **legal recourse** for someone infringing on said patent.
That is not the case for Factom. Nor would it make any sense for it to be. They're not a judicial agency.

Oh, you want it decentralized? Ok, email it out to a bunch of random addresses. Done! 
The blockchain achieves decentralized consensus on the ownership of **valuable tokens** that should not be double-spendable. There is no need for a blockchain if you just need things decentralized and don't care about double-spending. You can just spam out your data to any random server (pastebin, dropbox, your gmail contacts, etc). The blockchain doesn't actually contribute anything meaningful here.
