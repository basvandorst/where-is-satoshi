Sounds like throwing the baby away with the bathwater. If btc is truly going to reach the potential people think, I feel like this is going to be the biggest hurdle. I hope what you say isn't true, because the point of the whole movement is to not be like the financial industry. But maybe. Its just me

I've always thought of it as digital gold, yes you can use to buy a tesla or Lamborghini but everyday use is still far along and its much too volatile right now. Rather it is a placeholder of wealth, that unlike fiat (the longest of which has only lasted 70 years and can crash tomorrow) is a little more realistic as being "future cash". And as previous people have said, brand recognition. Pharmaceuticals are a good example of this. Geniric Tylenol has an almost chemical composition as the brand Tylenol, but who do trust more. Simply because they were the first to synthesize acetaminophen, they got a head start, this creating brand trust

That's great. Hopefully they can grow to scale

Its all psycolology. Just don't feed onto the hype. Put your crypto in cold storage for a few months. Pretend that its money you took to a casino and don't expect to get back. Don't look at any exchange, and just grab a drink an enjoy life

If you really study the peaks and valleys of crypto trading its all oddly similar to btc trends. Like I said buy low sell high. I hope it drops more so I can get in on the low. Its not going away was my major point. Don't feed into the speculation, mine included. It will go back up

You wouldn't have to change any mining 
Algorithms. You just have to do the mining from a power source that isn't gas or coal and preferably scaleable. Perfect job for Elon. But seriously, easier said than done I agree. But not impossible, especially with the brilliant minds behind btc

What if you have a negligible amount, ie, around 1000. Would it make any difference/can you even be taxed on such a small amount

No more bitcoin for Christmas, my family is laughing at me since I gave everyone.1 last year. The funny part is I sold mine 7 months ago and profited a whopping 300 bucks. Could be worse, I could be you, reading this
