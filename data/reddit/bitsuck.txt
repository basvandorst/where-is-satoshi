That is what I think the retail outlet does.  It forces a wall at the price you set.  Very few would stray far away from your store's conversion rate.  So as long as that rate is above your initial BTC investment, you push the price up and create liquidity.

This new tax law is very penal.  They are punishing miners.  If there is a spike in price, you'd better hope your machine is OFF!  Otherwise you have to claim that value as income (at time of creation), even if you sell it for less or never sell it!
Its crazy.  I don't understand how law-abiding citizens will continue to mine.

resulting from those activities? 
A-8: Yes, when a taxpayer successfully “mines” virtual currency, the fair market value 
of the virtual currency as of the date of receipt is includible in gross income. See 
Publication 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income, for more information on taxable 
income.

BTCGuild reports how many hashes I've submitted results for and the reject rate.  So I'm not calculating how many hashes I should be getting, but rather taking how many hashes they have accepted, and calculating their worth.  I don't think there should be anything like 30% discrepancy there.  (Shouldn't be in your MPG either.  If you're only getting 70% of your MPG, your car requires some service)

I totally get that.  But rather than focusing on the situations in which, by taking action, it could work out the same, I'm focusing on the fact that you now must take action (and incur tax expenses) in the short-term.  I know many people that thought "This is neat, if it ends up going up: nifty, I'll figure out how to deal with the income if there is any.  If it ends up going down: fine.  I didn't invest any money in this anyway".  Now, everyone has skin in the game since it is taxable income, because you _could_ have gotten something out of it.

Also worth your time to do a quick google search for the difference between a "limit" order and a "market" order.
*market: means I'm willing to take whatever the standing offer is right now.
*limit: puts a threshold on the trade.  Seller gives the lowest price they're willing to sell for.  A Buyer gives the highest price they're willing to pay.  This is the type of trade that makes the trade books you can see on a site.

By the way, its retroactive.  I'm not sure why it would make sense to continue mining.  The paper work burden alone is hellish: you must claim the cryptoCoin as income when you get it: at the market value at that moment.  So... you'll pay taxes on it as income, even if you don't sell it.

I agree that prices may dwindle if there isn't another use for the bitcoin and people are looking for ways to cut their losses.  There isn't (yet) a competing price driver, so it would only go back down if people are suddenly willing to sell for significantly less than what they paid.  I would imagine that it makes more sense for them to spend their BTC at one of the many sites that just offers current-market value.
@_date: 2014-04-04 21:27:07
Price the merch such that bitcoin spent at my retail site is a fixed exchange rate to USD (maybe: $2k).  This gives people incentive to keep buying up the orders to ~$1980-ish.  Also creates liquidity since there is a known outlet to get fixed value for BTC.
@_date: 2014-03-28 22:40:38
yeah, I didn't mean that I think it shouldn't be taxed.  Just shouldn't be taxed until it is either sold, or traded for something of value.  It's real hard for me to justify BTC as income before making a transaction with it...

so then what's the problem there?  My first 1000s of coins quadrupled in value, my last 10 coins are at current market value.  Right?  Now if you want those to be liquid (so price doesn't take a dump as you sell them off) you run a retail outlet that fixes the price at your desired value.
@_date: 2014-03-28 22:38:10
Agreed.  Does anyone know if that rule applies to creation of value in general?  If I write some code, do I have to pay taxes on that as income at the expected sale price, even if I don't sell it for 3 more years?  How about if I build a dog house and paint it real nice?

Because if it takes more work, I want more money for my work.  I have 2BTCs.  I know &lt;insert trusted xchange name here&gt; will give me money quickly and easily.  I will sell 1BTC on that exchange for $500.  I know Mt. Gox may not pay me for months, so I won't sell on there unless I think I may get $850 when it finally comes through.  So I set my price as $500 on quick and easy, and $850 on risky mt gox.

Except that *coin value increase is assumed in the price of the mining rigs.  All gear (that I've seen) assumes a significant increase in the sellable value of the *coin.
My plan, was mine and see if makes me wealthy, then worry about the tax implication if I had net profit.  In the meantime, I'm just wasting solar power.  Now: it's a tax liability immediately.  I think this takes mining + speculation out of the equation.

Sure... my major hangup here, is that you must send $s to the IRS this year, no matter what your long term plans were for the *coin.  Even if  BTC ends up on par with Doge, you still owe $ to tax man based on what that *coin _was_ worth when you mined it.  Then if it ends up being worth more when you sell, that's OK too, because that becomes a taxable gain.  All the suckers that had a rig chugging away at the beginning of 2014 are boned.
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:16:25
And to follow on that:

4) if another buyer offers 300 satoshi for 150k DOGE, the buyer will receive 100k DOGE, but at the price of 200 satoshi (the lowest price out there to satisfy the order).
... if there is another seller behind the first selling for 250 satoshi, then the buyer's order will continue to fill out of that sale until the buyer gets the remaining DOGE, or the price exceeds the buyer's offer.
make some sense?

That isn't somewhere in the margins, where they could reasonably say they need to investigate further.

To your first point, that isn't quite true either.  If I was paid $100 for a service in Jan, then that service incurred $100 of expenses in August, that's $0 taxable income.  But if I mine 1 BTC in Jan (at $1k), then sell it for $0 on mtGox in August, that's $1000 of taxable income, even though there is no net "value".  Or am I misunderstanding?

Simple questions:
If the market cap was 1 BTC (as you offered in part of you explanation) would you think the exchange rate of 1 BTC -&gt; USD would still be ~$580?  Or are you agreeing with OP that taking BTC off the market makes the exchange rate to fiat go up?  (or possibly suggesting it would go down?!)

Yes.  Also, I'm no longer confident how the deal amount is negotiated...  If a buyer offers 5 monies for 1 noncoin, and a seller requests 4 monies for a noncoin, at what price does the transaction occur?? 
@_date: 2014-04-05 23:40:18
BTC's only real value comes from the ability to execute a transaction.  There are lots of people "speculating", but the folly is that there is no intrinsic value that makes 10 btc any more valuable than 1 btc.  It is infinitely divisible, so you always "have enough" to make a transaction.  There will never be a point in time when someone is in a pickle, and will pay whatever they have to pay in order to get 3.6 btc.  People will only ever be in a situation where they say, I need to get $10,000 to someone, I'll buy however many BTC that is (totally irrelevant what that number is) and the dude on the other end will sell it to get ~$10,000.  So there is no supply and demand driving the price.  There is always enough, and there is no demand for more.  The price will go to ~0 unless there is a way to back it.
@_date: 2014-04-04 21:54:51
There's a really helpful [calculator](
It shows how the difficulty increase and the electricity cost effect your profitability.  Unless you got your mining rig for drugs, you probably spent more than you'll get back...  So at this point, you're not a profitably modeled business, you're a speculator (hoping the value of BTC goes up).  So, like most are saying here, just buy the BTC and speculate: straight up.
Or switch to [doge]( and make it clear that you're in it for much fun.
@_date: 2014-04-04 19:33:06
But the big retailer is already doing it with fiat.  right?  Investor pushes in a few hundred million dollars, you run that portion of the operation at break even, you make 1B on the original investment + ~$0 on the operation (which was only there to bump up the value of BTC).
@_date: 2014-04-04 22:09:55
I could totally understand if you said "...misunderstanding of basic ~~economics~~ **law** here."  But as far as I understand, this sort of thing is hugely profitable and prohibited where people are dealing with fiat, since it has potential to "destabilize" (read: take out of the hands of govt) currencies.  Since this is unregulated, limited-supply [property (according to IRS)]( why isn't it sound economically?

That's OK too.  I'm looking to get a lot of bitcoin then move the price up to significantly more than the average price I spent.  If that happens as a consequence of the buying: great.  Now I run the retail operation so that the value stays solid, which creates liquidity since people know they can get $X worth of merch for their bitcoin.
