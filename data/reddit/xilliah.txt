Why is the maintenance so astronomical?

I see, thanks.

This is what I never understood about anti fission energy rallies. They never spoke a word about alternatives.

Isn't the pay per impression less than 1 usd? I wouldn't mind paying 10 a month to get rid of them.

I'd rather pay a subscription fee. Ads are fine but they keep repeating the same shit over and over and it's rarely anything I want.

Those only have value within the right context. Just like bitcoins do and anything else. On their own they have no value.

Buying bitcoins took me 2 weeks in Germany. Is it faster in Egypt? 
Edit: also someone from Egypt told me it's illegal to transfer more than 10 or 20k to the EU? Is this related? They have some weird laws around the Nile.

Interesting to say the least. Imagine we would not have wikipedia. I like it and that's why I donate to them. And that's how they keep going. Why isn't wikipedia a government program at the moment? Also I would focus less on military and more on scientific pursuit. Having the choice to pay, and how much, really gives me a new perspective on government.

You can use wikipedia without paying for it. For healthcare there might be similar systems we don't know yet. I'm young and healthy but appreciate health a lot and would find it a good place to spend some money.

You could have a whitelist and a register. If you spend outside this list it can be seen as dubious.

I've never heard of it..
