Microcenter more than doubled the prices on [MSI RX580 8GB]( from $320 to $699 just this last week. I went there a few days ago and people were lined up outside the door just to get the [XFX 4GB]( models they had in stock (they had 6 or so) - even those are selling for $699 now.   These prices are insane now - but that's supply and demand for you.

I keep my various wallets on a Virtual Machine which I do not do any browsing or install any other programs on.  I only juice up the VM when I have some walleting to do :)

You never know when just the right iceberg is going to come by and sink the unsinkable. Nothing is permanent or forever... except Orgalorg... Orgalorg is forever.

Hopefully you've not transferred a whole bunch of coins, but rather a small amount you're fine losing should something go wrong with the recovery.  [Here's a video that demonstrates Trezor Recovery](

I've found it favorable as well (especially the fees).  I just wish they supported LiteCoin - then I'd probably abandon Coinbase altogether.  
PS: It took about two months for my approval to go through.  I had to Email support a few times to get things moving forward.

Indeed.  Basically, "Pay tour taxes or they'll find you \- and they won't be kind!" is the moral of the story

Exchanges like Coinbase, Gemini, and Kraken.

What is the secret to getting verified?  My account is over month old - all documentation has been provided, bank accounts liked, etc. - still not verified.  Customer support has not returned any of my inquiries as to status or further information they may need from me.  I'm guessing that maybe they are just slammed with new account applications or something?

I'm in the same boat. Two months, no verification, no response to support tickets.
