Nobody knows. The people who say it will crash are trying to make the price drop so they can buy in and the people who say it will surge are trying to hype up the market and make a quick buck.

I've transferred &gt;50k Euros without issue - twice. Whole process took &lt; 1/2 day.

You can use the same address, but people might know who you are. Generally, if you are not paranoid, this does not matter and had the secondary benefit of reducing the size of the payment file which is linked to transmission fees when you are using your Bitcoin to pay for something.

Keep the altcoins, they will go up again eventually.

That will be the day...

This happens all the time with tap on/tap off public transport tickets.
Tap on = maximum fare deducted
Tap off = refund given
In addition to that, the company earns your money by forcing you to buy more than what you may require such as a $10 ticket when you may only need to spend $2 for the trip.

Perhaps the outcome will be that withdrawals from the exchanges (once the fud dissipates) will only be allowed in tokenized RMB... Since anyone who understands Bitcoin transfers and digital wallets would not have difficulty learning how to use the government wallet, which would then be tied down to individual identities...
Everybody wins.

Exactly. And that is how it will be implemented!

Though it's evil to wish for it, and it speaks of ones personality, wishing for something doesn't actually make something happen!!!

Because there is no actual 'money' on the trezor, just the codes to allow you to control them...

Close to zero.
The government's will not give up that easily. 
What will probably happen is that more countries will tokenize their currencies and impose increasing regulations on Bitcoin (and by that I am referring to all cryptocoins).
What would be phenomenal would be if countries readopted the gold standard, but with Bitcoin instead of gold. One can certainly dream. ;)

That was an awesome chart!

If you use that analogy, then you could also say bitcoiners can not be educated since litecoin has actually got more cutting edge tech and does not suffer from brand confusion aka. bitcoin vs bitcoin cash vs segwit2x...

Ultimately, any strategy that is safer, will lead to lower profits. Anything that is riskier, will lead to more profits. 
It's just how the world works. 
Unless you are a bank where you take huge risks with someone else's money and keep any profits if the decision was good, or wait for the government to bail you out if it was a poor decision.
