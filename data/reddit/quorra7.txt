There are Coinkite and ANX debit cards too.

It means free in every sense of that word, similar to ideas, and in most cases without a price tag, i. e. not represented by currency units. And thankfully there are tech initiatives, in the works for years now, which will soon free the information, people and the world almost completely.

You can contact any of the developers supporting the core devs in their free time, some of them might be able to commit to this almost full time, there is a long list here:  and there are also some great ones here and other forums. I personally know mostly busy VFX designers. It's absolutely important of course, actually it should have happened already!
@_date: 2014-03-04 02:08:17
I'm just an observer in this case, here is some more info:  
All in all, Gox doesn't seem quite sincere, also considering the most recent announcement on their website. Some more views on the situation:  &amp;  
There can most likely be more potential upsides than downsides because MtGox has lead investors/traders into a tragically unfavorable situation, not the other way around, and actually they haven't been really responsible since 2011 as a business (some even claim 2009). But you can ask Selachii anything regarding your concerns directly, they seem friendly:  or by email.
@_date: 2014-05-18 17:16:27
It's really a logical and great thing to do, especially now, because of everything happening with the Foundation recently, while the main reason to justify ANYthing they do seems to be only the fact they're compensating the core developers, or at least some of them.
Lighthouse currently seems to be the best and most secure decentralized Bitcoin equivalent of such a platform. There are also many other similar platforms already. Who would like to set up the first crowdfunding campaign?
@_date: 2014-03-11 18:35:40
It's obvious I just wanted to let more people know about Elliptic as it's related to Lloyd's insurance market and bank working on one of the most important next stages of development for safe Bitcoin cold storage. It has much to do with the topic of the original post. Also, it makes sense to ask others' opinions online, it's how people learn and grow. I just didn't have time to mention all that. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 01:03:53
I screamed, also due to many other positive news regarding Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-05-18 22:13:55
@_date: 2014-05-18 21:53:34
Yes. 
And Maidsafe.net will also contribute to absolutely everything outlined there.

And three months after that article was published, there are still 6-7 core developers, BitPay is allegedly still the only company really giving back to the core development and other companies that come into consideration are all BF's industry members, while individual crowdfunding still hasn't been arranged. As some people are influencing all such flexible and effective development decisions for some reason.
@_date: 2014-05-18 23:45:16
 and there are many similar articles and forum posts.

You didn't see I'm Quorra!
@_date: 2014-05-18 23:23:31
Centralization is the problem, and obviously the fact that more (core) developers are needed but are not getting recruited and compensated for more quality work required. 
Also, BitPay still seems to be the only company from the ecosystem really giving back to the core development.
@_date: 2014-03-04 02:35:41
You're welcome. Also, as far as I can tell everyone should get most likely all of their funds back no matter the outcomes, even MtGox seems to be thinking in that direction.
@_date: 2014-04-27 05:10:49
It happened a year ago and still a relatively high amount of funds needs to be raised.
@_date: 2014-03-14 01:57:25
It's not my company :) I first pasted it under one of OP's comments to show him the best way world banks are currently interested in Bitcoin, then accidentally pasted it under your comment too.   
@_date: 2014-05-18 22:39:47
That is the problem, funding core development needs to be decentralized and distributed to all the Bitcoin users who want to participate, and there are many.

No, I just started this discussion. Do you plan to set up a campaign for the core devs? :)

NOVA GAIA / UNITED
For the Betterment of Humanity.
"If we can just let go of the notion of chasing after 'created scarcity' or creating units of monetary value that only a few people can access freely. If all digital money is created then why not create an abundant amount of it in the alternative community (skip a few decades of the old currency market trading model). Become 'United in Diversity' with a common interest of the advancement of our human potential. Create an abundant amount of it, then release it for 'everyone to access and share' and really get the r(e)volutionary party started. We can co-create our New Earth reality much faster."

@_date: 2014-05-20 22:01:33
You're welcome. And really if you don't find anyone there who has the time (since many of them are almost core devs in a volunteering way), there are some great ones on forums and elsewhere. Also, am not a sir :D
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:14:29
Not with open-source ATMs like Skyhook or Localbitcoins' that will be available soon.
@_date: 2014-05-20 16:49:43
Amazing! I didn't know it's that far in the making, I was about to ask Andreas, and Roger what they think about it. When do you think it will be ready?
Such concepts and platforms for more guaranteed recurring payments generally have an enourmous potential, they can really revolutionize many things, e.g. educational systems. 
So far in the world only specific types of professionals have implemented it into their workflows, mostly for active online and meetups-based learning in multimedia creative industries.
@_date: 2014-03-09 19:24:01
Have him read this:  or similar.
@_date: 2014-05-18 20:49:17
This is very good, would be much better if it was forum-, not email-based. But the concept is one of the best solutions.
@_date: 2014-05-18 05:27:18
Crowdfunding, donations etc. are way much better solutions, especially for this type of open source crowdsourcing.
@_date: 2014-05-18 04:54:55
Anything just representing something is detached from the essence of that "thing" and easily becomes a corruptible token, means of exchange.
Decentralized and distributed internet, trustless protocols, neural networks etc. will help a lot, but human species collectively still hasn't reached the level of consciousness needed to function without tokens representing human energy, potential, will and many other qualities. 
But thanks to information technology and computer science, most people today at least accept the fact that information is free. Regardless of e.g. many institutions still charging many different "tokens" for types of information accepted as common knowledge. And so on.

The only real, actual "currency" is information, together with energy (human, economic).
@_date: 2014-05-18 23:58:53
Many others have expressed similar opinions, also in the above article.
@_date: 2014-05-19 18:22:07
Great! I just started this discussion and currently don't have any more time, so if you want to set up a campaign for the core devs, feel free to do so with your platform's community.
@_date: 2014-03-04 02:59:31
:D all this won't take too long at least because they also want to save their business so...wait a bit more and see!

P.S. For developers: 
@_date: 2013-09-08 11:44:37
Will Coinkite solve these issues? Except confirmations of up to one hour.

Currently it's 0.005 BTC per week (a break even after approx 15 days which is considered fair) and it's approx 0.02 per (next) month even if the difficulty continues to increase at similar speed. Many seemingly trustworthy companies still offer 1 GH from $7.5 and $10.8, even after the price increases lately, obviously because selling GH isn't their only income stream but they sell a limited amount of hashing power of course. I've found only one place with 0.08 BTC/GH but such pricing makes it hard to break even regardless of the price increases, it's hard of course due to the difficulty still skyrocketing. All in all I thought there are individual miners here who have really optimized their systems and are therefore willing to rent Gigahashes.

Can't wait for them to arrive in Central Europe part of the EU.

Better Bitpay or even Coinvoice, than Stripe and similar services because PayPal/eBay etc. will most likely buy them and similar ones too in the near future:

Thanks! But before I do, would pooled mining with GUIMiner on Windows 64-bit be safe for a desktop-like HP laptop with Nvidia? And would it make sense?
@_date: 2013-09-08 20:56:39
The type of wallet presented is just one of the suggestions from the developer community, there will be many different options until 2014 and someone should also create a version of Electrum and MultiBit for Meta OS because really many types of professionals will be using that wearable computing, some even instead of smartphones because the practicability and possibilities of that kind of augmented reality are endless. What's important this year is that all the creators of that revolutionary hardware are supporting Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-09-08 08:48:53
 (for feedback).
@_date: 2013-09-08 07:41:09
Ok I should have written "all levels coming very soon", but since everything is already set up for all levels and they should be ready in several days, that seemed kind of trivial. And when it comes to any issues with the site please contact the creators.

What about the bitcoinstore.com?
@_date: 2013-10-11 00:20:00
Something similar to this:  or even better, like Neteller for the Bitcoin world. Also with multi-signature implementation for web and mobile wallets as soon as possible.
