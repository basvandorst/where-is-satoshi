Fiat currency backed by real gold - the ultimate monetary system. I can't imagine any government/central bank allowing this to stand.

Way to dig deeper. Thank you. This certainly creates credibility problems for Bitreserve. TIL.

I agree that usury is a problem, although I wouldn't go so far to say big government isn't a problem. Of course, it is government which creates the laws (and uses guns) to protect and allow usury. Also, excluding Mr. North, I haven't read many libertarians who are against free currencies. Most are supportive as it fits into libertarian philosophical tenets.


I think your comment here is key. If someone controls the most basic unit of exchange, you cannot exchange values except under their rules. I'd much prefer to see bitcoins used for microtransactions everywhere than big purchases only in a few places. Promote bitcoin for small transactions. Encourage it to become ubiquitous for many "insignificant" exchanges of value. Don't focus on it for buying computers or outer-space trips. Focus on it for candy bars. Video games. Apps. The local kid who shovels your snow and rakes your leaves. Supporting websites you like. Birthday gifts.
When money is allowed to operate in a free(r) market, usury will be short-lived if not existent. Monopolies are what drive the price of anything up, including money. Monopolies don't last in free economies. Well, that is, they wouldn't if a free market were allowed to exist.
