I think quite a few have. I recently create my own skill-based gambling game and launched:   and seen about 630 BTC wagered in the last month, and growing pretty fast

When I started moneypot.com -- I think I was the first gambling site using bits, and people gave me hell for it. Perhaps it's selection bias, but I can't imagine any of the people ever wanting to go back to the days of counting leading 0s

Just sent myself $400 MXN. ( 0.09012787 to 18J9BBbAbAJjBdjrSvX4Zxda8yDdRs9kf1 )
It says it'll be ready in 2 hours, and I can pop down to an ATM and let you know how it goes.
Edit:  Received a confirmation email:
We have processed your transaction and sent the funds through BBVA's dinero móvil system. Please go to any BBVA ATM location, select the dinero móvil option, and enter the following information to collect your money:
Clave de Retiro: xxxx xxxx xxxx
Código de Seguridad: xxxx
I'll be passing an ATM on the way to lunch (they're everywhere) and will give it a try! Extremely promising.
So it looks like they're using:  to send money to an ATM. What's interesting is if they have a business partnership or not, and if they can send more than $5000 MXN / day sending -- as sending money across borders, with minimal fees and without even an id check just seems too good to be true.
Edit: GOT MY MONEY! 10/10 experience.  One thing they should make more clear though, is it doesn't work with all Bancomer ATMs, you need to use an upgraded one that supports dinero móvil
Here's the ATM dispensing the cash:
