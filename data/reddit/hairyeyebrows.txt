What about Litecoins or Dogecoins or etc.

Bitcoind sucks up about as much as someone watching a movie. High, unfortunately

I downloaded the lightningd software and compiled. I already have a running bitcoind node. When would I be able to turn it on?

I have a whole bunch of empty wallets.

Or losing their money

What about Bitcoin Tea? Bitter, yet not very sweet.

I get one of those scams every other day. I collect them. I have the originating IP address of the message and the bitcoin address. I'm not sure where to report. I've found some websites to report them but I'm not sure what good that does.

A high dividend paying stick. VZ for example.

That's a lot of energy. Considering that transportation contributes the most to CO2 pollution.

I get three or four blackmail emails per day on one of my email servers. Usually demanding 600 to 800 dollars in bitcoin for their not revealing the information about me which they don't have. Tiresome. I used to report the source IP addresses but not anymore.

No, I recognized the Internet was starting something back in 1993.

In my opinion crypto coins are dead.

Hey I'm an old foggie who made about $1,000 off of Bitcoin. It is interesting but it's another fad. Fads come and go. It might find a fit in some niche but it'll never replace dollars.

Yep. I've been in IT for over 40 years. I've seen lots of fads come and go. Cloud architecture is a growing one currently. Block chain is not.
