One thing though: how do you process individual payments? I notice you're specifying just one generic wallet address above. What if I send some satoshis there, and someone else (who could even be monitoring this address 24/7) claims it's *his* payment. Who's gonna get the entrance seat?

Awesome! I live close to Nijmegen and dig stand-up comedy, so as a ฿eliever I'll definitely come and spend some bitcoins there!

I work at (and co-own) a business that accepts Bitcoin payments. Feel free to send your questions in a private message, or fire away here if you want.

Yes, very.
* Merchant: That'll be 38.69 sir.
* You: I'd like to pay with Bitcoin.
* Merchant: Sure thing!
Enters 38.69 on his phone/tablet/laptop and clicks "Start Bitcoin payment", QR code appears.
* Merchant: Here ya go.
You scan the QR with Breadwallet / Mycelium / Copay / whatever Bitcoin wallet you use, and click "Send".
Merchant's display shows "Payment received" in 1-2 seconds.
* Merchant: Thanks, have a nice day!

Why the vitrol, dude. Things have to start somewhere! 
You'd probably prefer merchants to accept *and hold* the bitcoins. Yeah well so do I, but that's simply not realistic (yet). They pay their staff, taxes, expenses, supplies, rent, and everything else in fiat. 
This is just a migration stage - once a critical mass of merchants accept Bitcoin, they will soon enough figure there is no more reason to convert bitcoins back to fiat, as they can actually spend the bitcoins directly for their business expenses. 
That's when things really get rolling - but you can impossibly expect this to happen overnight. Until we get there, the current in-between phase where things can smoothly migrate from fiat to Bitcoin is necessary and desirable.
I think it's fantastic to see more and more everyday businesses accepting Bitcoin, regardless of whether they still exchange it back into fiat or not. Filling up your car with Bitcoin was simply *unthinkable* a few years ago. This is revolution in progress, sir!
P.S. I can assure you that Bitpay or Coinbase were not involved.
