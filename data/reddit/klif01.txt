I love working for my company (recent tech startup within the last 2 years) that gives unlimited time off! I don't abuse it though, and realize that when I do take time off, it puts an extra load on my teammates. I also work full time from home halfway across the country from the actual offices.

I've been using Coinbase since 2013, bought and sold 50~ bitcoin and haven't had this issue yet. Read about it a ton though!

Just spend a fraction of your bitcoin on the smaller purchases. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 01:35:02
I would guess they have a website and a contact us link. I'm on my phone otherwise I would happily find it. I think a simple request to accept bitcoin will at least get a response.

I wish there were more places in Denver for me to spend my bitcoin...the sentiment in r/denver wasn't very welcoming either when mentioning bitcoin

Depends on the purchase price. If you bought at 90 and sold at 100 then you have a realized gain of $100. If you bought at $120 and sold at $100 you have a realized loss of $200. If you bought at $100 and held, you now have an unrealized gain of $3000. 
You should claim the realized gain or loss, unrealized you should wait until sold. 
If you sold at $500 then you should claim a capital gain of $4000. 
I have stocks that have risen about $4000 this year above my purchase price. I'm not selling them before the year is over so I won't have a realized capital gain to claim.

If you have $100 and it would make you upset if you placed a bet, say at a blackjack table, and lost it all...then $100 is too much. No one knows your financial situation. 
If you don't have retirement savings setup and contributing to it, 401k or roth, maybe life insurance if you're supporting a family, and other currently more stable plans for the future I personally feel like bitcoin is just a few steps above the last powerball ticket I bought and probably not the best first step to financial stability in your life.

Why wouldn't you take free money your employer offers?
@_date: 2013-11-06 03:21:14
It sounds like those rental properties, if you took some time to re-align the budgets with, could actually support the retirement then and losing the 20k isn't as bad of a deal. My biggest concern is having that emergency fund/plan for if something catastrophic happens to the rental properties. But hey if you have the right kind of insurance policy to cover those situations which cover lost revenue etc then go for it. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 01:37:30
Just a theoretical question. If someone (not me) trades and makes money on the price fluctuation eg playing the forex market, then yes they expect prices to drop at least some so they can buy, then sell when it's higher. 
I don't care about that, I'm only wondering if you can send bitcoin to a bitstamp account rather than having to send usd to a bitstamp account. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 06:44:40
Well how much money do you have. Say I have 100k in USD to buy BTC, no more. If I buy 100k worth of bitcoin on stamp then sell them at a 20% gain on gox...I now have 0$ available to buy again on stamp but I have 100k in usd stuck at gox. So sure it works if you never want to transfer cash, but why wouldn't you want to transfer cash?
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:41:08

They are referring to the adoption period of Facebook Twitter etc before they went public. There are some good videos talking about it. 
I would be interested to see the flip side of some company that started to be heavily adopted but then flopped before going public (where we, presumably, are today on the logarithmic scale.)
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:55:43
I agree with you, I have a bunch of paper wallets, most are empty but working on changing that slowly. Just like to hear of other options for storing these wallets so I'm curious why you would need the whole blockchain saved.

I really don't want to be mean, but I'm really glad I was shown the value of saving for retirement when I started working at 16. I'm a long way from retiring but having 20k to retire on is terrifying. 
I'm of the opinion bitcoin will gain in value, but what I buy in bitcoin I am prepared and diversified that it could go to zero and I wouldn't cry. Will it go to the moon, hopefully, but I would hate to see you assist your mom gambling her retirement funds, then when the value dips, sell in a panic, or worse yet some fatal flaw kill bitcoin and the value stay at zero. 
Is there some sort of way to put this 20k into the rental properties to bring a more steady income? I lived most of my time in college for free because of the people I had renting rooms from me in my house. (the value of that house when I sold is a different story)

I read elsewhere that the price per bitcoin to make mining profitible again for someone to start mining is around $1300/btc right now. 
I'm not sure how they calculated that and I'm wondering if you may know or have any ideas what it costs relative to the price of btc
@_date: 2013-12-11 01:29:31
Chilis already has this at each table. Or at least the one I went to in Colorado. Send them the same email. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:51:59
why would you need the blockchain on the drive. You could start by just storing a text file with your private key which is all you need to recover your public address....
@_date: 2013-11-06 02:49:28
That's what I did. Created an address offline on a computer that is not and will not be on the network, then sent from coinbase account to that public address.
@_date: 2013-11-17 18:35:55
Nope it doesn't work. You can set it to (buy $10 of btc/day) but the order doesn't go through once the time comes because it's below the limit. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 01:15:30
Maybe this is an unpopular opinion, but you made a mistake and having your bank block the transaction isn't fair to coinbase on their end. Also one of the things I assume they're trying to fight with fraud/chargebacks etc. 
 I'm not sure how coinbase is setup, but maybe they automatically buy btc immediately at the price they quote you, and only release it to your account when your bank clears. In the grand scheme, it's probably not a big hit to their business, but stuff like this imo makes it more of a pain for other users.
 In this situation I think the respectable plan of action would be to ask coinbase to stop it, not blocking them from what you set your account up to do.

Why is bitcoin a viable option for merchants to accept right now?
As a layman I look at say for example a pair of shoes I want to buy off Amazon with a pretty stable price of 80$. 
If someone accepts bitcoin do they have to have a constantly fluctuating price to match the current exchange rate that is so volatile right now. If I sold those shoes for .4 btc then the price crashes to $100/btc I feel like I wouldn't be motivated to keep selling for bitcoin. 
Also, how long do you think until this crazy price train is more steady?  
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:59:40
Upvote for a legitimate concern/point! I'm not from Denmark but know plenty of dumb blonds.....crap I'm not even a blond and I fit into this category as well! 
Things like  will I think help the "dumb" user use bitcoin.

never used btcbalance, so I can't speak for that website. I know on blockchain, without an account you can just search any public address and see the balance ie 14aSfq9Z8891AK4nNXwZGPxwwMK2iLYMar - I wouldn't mind if that was my balance...
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:13:56
Can't mine forever though. What would entice a miner to keep their equipment running the network if they aren't mining. Do they start to get paid more for the transactions, or just assuming there are more transactions happening?

edit: don't listen to me, I was wrong, you get the private key as well. My only issue is you're creating this wallet while you're online.

If I have a private key to my wallet, how do I spend the bitcoins in my public wallet address without ever exposing the private key to a network.
@_date: 2013-11-22 06:56:56
[bitcoinity.org]( - at the top right, click WTF, it gives a decent explanation.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:50:28
I'm hoping it continues up then becomes stable. Me personally I haven't found the ability to spend my bitcoin as easy as just using my credit card so I look at bitcoin as more of a "gold"/store of value rather than something I spend. But its also way easier for me to buy bitcoin than it is for me to buy gold, and easier to spend than gold. 
I'm sure a lot of other people just getting into btc are doing the same, but as more and more people start accepting as payment it I would think the price will start to be stable as well. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 04:06:50
Go to the import/export button on blockchain.info then at the top you can add watch only addresses. This way you could put your paper wallets public address/associate it with the blockchain.info account, but without putting your public key in there all you can do is see the balance on your blockchain account.
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:57:51
Weird. I got an email mine hadn't gone through because it was below the minimum transaction amount. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 06:03:42
You didn't say why it got to that price...
@_date: 2013-11-07 03:27:16
Not judging you, just stating how I feel about blocking a transaction through your bank after you messed up is all. Someone who admits their mistakes and learns to be more careful in the future rather than trying to find a backwards selfish way to not suffer a loss wins points in my book. 
My hope is that coinbase does honor that request as a customer service deal and all is done. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 03:30:43
You just answered your question. You're scared of a loss. Don't invest that much of your savings. 
I would suggest checking our You should definitely diversify! 50% is way too much in my opinion. I have about 5% of my investing money (money separate from 1 year of living expenses savings account, 401k, whole life insurance contributions, and monthly budget out of my paycheck) invested in bitcoin. Yes it has outperformed all my other investments by 598% but it could also drop below what I paid for it.

Instant buy is still there, but the counter is for some reason gone (showing how much instant buy you have available) eg, for me I can buy somewhere between 5 and 6 instantly because when I buy 5 it says they will be there instantly, but if I buy 6 it will be there in 4 business days. 
I bought some coin a couple days ago so it makes sense I don't have the full 10 coin limit available.

I hope it becomes a currency I can spend easier, and heck start getting rewards to spend it like I do with my credit card. 
I think of all the options I have on where I put my savings. If people want to compare bitcoin to gold, tell me first how easy it is (comparatively) to buy some bitcoin vs gold, then think about what merchants do you know that accept gold as a payment. This is why I'm optimistic the value of BTC is very under valued right now!
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:25:51
Did you use the iphone app? I did the same thing (selling 5 coins) twice and it froze the first time so I thought it didn't go through. But that was my fault for trying the transaction again before checking my btc balance. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:12:20
Yes, they were supposed to be there today by 6:30PST. Still not there. 
I had two other orders from earlier in the day, same day last week, that did come through this morning when they said they would come through. I think my order was supposed to show up right as everything went weird and prices dropped....I'm gonna sleep on it and if they're still not there, contact customer support. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:52:52
You're right, I was looking at the bitcoin address in my transaction history which I wasn't given a private key, only the public as well as the QR code, assumed that was the paper wallet OP was talking about. I created my paper wallets offline outside of coinbase.
@_date: 2013-11-07 01:56:57
If you're 100% sure they will tell you they can't do anything about it, why did you email them? 
I personally feel like canceling this transaction through your bank is defrauding coinbase and wrong. 
It's like you're going to get your house painted. The value of your house can go up and down. The painter for some strange reason has a machine that paints your house instantly with a push of a button. He takes your bank info and hands you the machine to push one of two buttons. Red button paints the house red, blue button paints it blue. The problem is, the paint doesn't dry instantly and you have to wait 6 days before you can sell your house.  
You want red, but fuck up and push blue. Too late, he painted your house blue, instantly. Now you go to the bank and try to cancel the transaction and the painter loses so he makes the process more frustratingly difficult for the users who aren't defrauding them while he slowly figures out an easier process to protect himself and make it easy for the end user. 
I need to go do something productive with my time now...
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:46:22
It could be the most expensive penny stock style pump and dump ever....or were just part of the adoption phase and bitcoin value is going vertical. 
Hopefully the latter, but I haven't put all my eggs in one basket betting on it. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 06:09:48
While you're at it, why don't you just buy BTC with USD, send your BTC to a Chinese exchange then send your CNY to USD. Rinse, repeat, the Chinese exchange prices are way higher than the US$ exchanges. The biggest problem is the difficulty of transferring/exchanging fiat. 
Say you bought 1 BTC for 500 on stamp, transfer it to gox and sell it for 550. Now you have $550 in a gox exchange which is a pain to get $$$ out. So in theory you can do this but the time spent trying to get $ out and back to the other exchange the prices could change plenty.

So how would I create this signature via my private key without ever entering this private key into say my blockchain.info wallet that is watching my public address if I want to spend the coin on something. 
The reason I ask is I want to avoid exposing this private key to any network so I can continue to use the same public address for the coin even after I spend it on something and not worry about security.
