It's a defunct currency, so they're worth as much as you're willing to pay for them on eBay.

When you buy products in Japan, you also pay an 8% consumption tax. BTC is no longer subject to that.

Even so, the various editions have different things on page 98. Unless, of course, it's George, which is at the top of each lefthand page, or A, which is at the top of the right hand pages. Assuming that's also the case with the other editions, anyway.

All right, mulled over this enough.
My thoughts:
1. blade (US paperback)
2. Venus (Birth of Venus, famous **Renaissance** painting)
3. Something relating to Golden (divine) ratio. 1.61803. Often appears in **Renaissance** art.
4. Powell was first thought. Marcus Gavius Apicius may have compiled the first collection of recipes. **Bartolomeo Platina wrote the first printed cookbook, during the Renaissance**.
5. Flatirons. There's even a hotel called **Renaissance** Boulder Flatiron Hotel. Maybe I'm thinking too much into the Renaissance connection though.
Hope this helps someone!
