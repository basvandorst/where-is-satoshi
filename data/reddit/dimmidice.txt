i wouldn't. i use paypal all the time it's pretty much the only way for me to pay for things online.
plus i havent had any problems with paypal in all the time i use it (except when i make stupid mistakes, but even then i just open a ticket and have it solved within 5 days or so)

so what?
@_date: 2014-03-01 10:09:57

@_date: 2013-12-08 10:39:15

use /s at the end of your post if you're sarcastic. it really helps.
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:11:39
don't take the accusations personally. it's the internet, people online really need to be skeptical cause there are liars and cheaters around every corner. 
plus if you really want to prove you are legit it's not that difficult really. just take a picture with a piece of paper :)

it matters cause they made it matter by making a big deal out of the age.
his message may be true, that doesn't excuse the lying.

seriously. good things don't always get better, and bad things don't always get worse.
cause good things are subjective, as are bad things.
this entire post feels entirely like a bunch of propaganda.
if he got introduced to this group weeks ago why didnt he make his account til 2 hours ago?
