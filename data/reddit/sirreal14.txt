Okay so you think Monday's opening price will be below Friday's closing price. I'm trying to understand you confusion. How does spot play into this?
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:02:25
Initial Margin requirements are typically higher than Minimum Margin requirements, so no there likely won't be margin calls unless there is an extraordinarily low price on Monday (if that's when the mark-to-market happens).
Check out how the [mark-to-market process]( happens and how a [margin call]( works.

Why do you think the Futures prices will be way below spot?

Because if you make 1000 random guesses, one of them is bound to be correct lmao.

I agree with the top comment! Front page of The Economist was sweet.

That's not how anything works at all. The Canadian dollar isn't back by any sort of physical asset. The USD is the reserve currency of the world. Under your framework, when the Fed made an announcement yesterday and the USD value fell, you would expect the exchange rate to stay the same. But, because you are very wrong, [the value of CAD denominated in USD rose dramatically.]( Similarly look at what USD denominated gold did yesterday.

Explain this statement. The example you gave is nonsensical. 
@_date: 2016-01-07 19:10:19
Yup! All calculations were performed at the following resolutions/time periods:
* Five years of data; one month resolution
* Five years of data; daily resolution
* One year of data; daily resolution
* Three months of data; ten minute resolution
The full table of results is probably more interesting than my drab conclusions, and I invite everyone to look at it and speculate about the results. [Here is a screenshot of all of the results.](

I sure do! I could post it wherever would let me post a several megabyte spreadsheet, any ideas how I should share it?
@_date: 2016-01-07 18:31:38
That's probably half of the one-sentence TLDR, the other half being something like: 


Which I think is also really interesting!


I actually did this calculation! I was expecting to see a somewhat negative correlation and negative beta, but that did not consistently present itself across the data. 
@_date: 2016-01-07 18:42:21
* Thank you for the info about R^2 , I'm looking for a more critical eye on this work, so thanks for that!
* Both of the beta adjustment methods (Scholes-Williams and Dimson) take autocorrelation into account (I believe). However, doing a Durbin-Wastson test would be really interesting in addition so it could be talked about in the paper
In my mind this is definitely a working paper that I eventually hope to make very good (or at least better). Please let me know of anything else I should take into account!

Sure! I'm an undergrad but this class was open for both masters and undergrad students. 
Bitcoin is pretty cool. Some people can't agree on it's classification: currency, commodity, something new? Beta is a finance thing that measures the risk of an asset versus a portfolio, it seeks to find out how much risk is common to both and how much is idiosyncratic.
Beta is usually calculated against market indexes, so I did that. Here we are expecting a low beta, maybe even a negative beta.
Then I calculated it against gold, a currency index, and a commodity index. The reason for this is to look to see if bitcoin shares risk with these categories of assets. A beta of close to 1 against these assets would indicate that bitcoin shares a large amount of common risk with these categories, perhaps meaning that bitcoin could be considered part of that category. 
The results against market indexes were as expected, bitcoin does not seem to share significant risk with the market index, thus it looks like bitcoin can be used to further diversify an investor. 
The results against the other portfolios seem to suggest that bitcoin does not share significant risk with any existing categories, so perhaps this lends credence to the theory that bitcoin is a new type of asset. 
@_date: 2016-01-07 18:43:37
Sure thing! I'm not sure where else I could post it though, any ideas?

Your wording wasn't poor, your wording was wrong. There is nothing backing any fiat currency. Their value is derived from their subjective utility as a currency. Being able to pay taxes in fiat currency adds to it's utility, thus generally adding to it's value (of course, every individual has different utility from the currency, and has individual subjective value of the currency, but in general most people gain utility from being forced to pay taxes in the fiat currency). This is very very very different from being "backed" by the government. 
This government imposed utility is no different from any other source of utility, and indeed no different from being able to buy your coffee with the currency. Bitcoin does not have this government imposed utility, but it has utility as a currency independent of that. Its situation is most comparable to being like the US dollar is here in Canada. It has no government imposed utility here, but most stores still take it as payment. People still subjectively value it, despite not being backed by a single thing, or it's lack of tax paying utility.

Yup! Returns are additive: say you own 50% X and 50% Y, if X returns 1% and Y returns 3%, your portfolio returns 2%. For an even cooler example let's assume X and Y both have an expected return of 2% and risk of 10%. The cool part is that risk (aka volatility aka standard deviation) isn't strictly additive. If X and Y both have a volatility of 10%, the overall risk of the portfolio will be less than 10% as long as X and Y aren't perfectly correlated. So with a 50/50 portfolio, you'll get the same expected return (2%) at a lower risk!

Excuse the data-heavy-ness and econometric-ness, the main reason I wrote this is to see if I could add to the classification debate by looking for empirical indications leaning one way or the other. I kinda wrote it with the bitcoin community in mind, as I tried to explain the section on what beta is as painlessly as possible. Ignore my hilariously bad citations, we weren't marked on them. I did get an awesome grade and (hopefully) this adds to the academic discourse around bitcoin, so overall I'm very happy with how things turned out!

This is an excellent idea, thanks for that

If you think that the [CAPM]( is a weird take on finance, then I know for a fact that you have never worked in private equity. That is just embarrassing. 


Literally the stupidest thing on the planet.

If you ever take any classes on finance, you'll learn that proper investing isn't about picking stocks, [financial theory]( says that you should try and invest in the [market portfolio]( Now obviously the market portfolio is impossible to invest in, (you'd need to own one one millionth of your neighbors house, for example) but you should try and approximate it as much as possible. Approximating the market portfolio means you diversify as much as possible, which means you actually want as much uncorrelated volatility as possible. Bitcoin has low correlation to any other asset, so any investor obtains the [free-lunch of diversification]( by investing small amounts in volatile and uncorrelated assets such as bitcoin.

Without humans on the earth, oil is just a black liquid in the ground. Value is entirely the result of human action, and thus is 100% subjective.

QuickBT.com will work if you have a debit card but only for small amounts. Another option is finding a bitcoin ATM in your area (something like a Waves Coffee place). If you live in a big city then you'll be able to find someone on Mycelium local trader and get a better deal than the ATM.

It is significantly better to have an offline password management system. You have to trust that Lastpass knows what they are doing, and using KeePass you do not have to trust anyone. Lastpass has also had security breaches before

If you are a follower of Rothbardian AnCapism (which appears to be the majority of AnCaps) then banking (specifically fractional reserve banking) is considered theft. It is definitely not welcome
