I guess it will be 30% of your profits. Like other gains from stocks or currency trading
So if your gain is $5000 it should be $1200 in tax.
Pro swede tip: get an ISK and buy the Bitcoin certificate instead. No capital gains tax ;-)
Edit: sorry, misread your numbers. But it should still be 30% of your profit

If I lived in a shit country like Venezuela, I'd rather hold regular Bitcoin than something the government issued
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:54:43
I could see the appeal if a stable state with a good economy launched a cryptocurrency. Maybe. At least why some might be interested
Venezuela? If i lived there the whole prospect of owning actual bitcions would be amplified x100

Sure, what do you want to know?
On Avanza:
Each share is about 1/200 btc. 
There is a transaction fee (courtage) and a yearly 2.5% Management fee. Easily worth it though, for legal tax Free gains and not being responsible for wallet security.
Edit: worth mentioning is you can only trade when the stock exchange is open. So on weekends you can only watch from the sideline. Both a good and bad thing I suppose

I am a android user, not an Apple fanboy. But Apple still does what Apple does best with the iPhone.. They rarely lead in specs or pure technical stuff, their thing is nice ui, simple to use and a walled garden eco system

It will either crash or reach new highs. It will be interesting to witness either way

Thats how i am exposed to bitcoins aswell. From my experience it tracks the price of bitcoins well. Only problem is that it only trades during the hours the stock market is open.
Today for example, the bitcoin was at a lower price when the stock market closed, so the tracker value is stuck at the last Transaction until the markets open again
The yearly fee of 2.5% is easily worth it to have a bitcoin investment in a brokerage account to me. But i understand the whole thing goes against the idealism of most people in this sub.
Daily volatilty is something you need to accept. Dont put too much into bitcoin, who who knows if its worth $1 or $1000.000 in a year

This. Financial advisers primary goal is to feed themself, not you.
Read about investments, asset allocation etc and try it out yourself. You can always start small alongside your managed account to see if it works for you.
And by the way, why not cash out enough to retire once ? Even if you dont think btc will crash, wouldnt you hate yourself if it did and you blew this opportunity?

Using leverage on a such volatile asset as bitcoin requires one helluva strong short term conviction. 
A single 20% dip would wipe you out

I love your dedication, but please be careful and have a plan b. OP has a point, putting all your savings in btc is a very high risk operation
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:20:08
There will be hedge funds and others large investors that shorts and "attacks" bitcoin, be assured.
Question is if it will succeed. Propably not wiping out bitcoin Forever, but big money will be made (and Lost) in trades in a near future
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:02:25
Yes. Holding Bitcoin is still hard and scary to non techies. This is Good news
And if if a large bank looses your bitcoins you could atleast hope for compensation.

I love that we have a Exchange Traded Note (ETN) on the stock exchange for Bitcoin here in sweden.
That doesnt exist in the US yet? Probably good news for peoople already owning :)

Political views aside, putting your money in diversified portfolio of blue chip stocks is the safest way to preserve value (and get returns) over long periods of time.
Currency is tricky, no matter if its bitcoins, usd or anything else. It holds value because we decided to agree that it has value. But its useless if should rethink and decide it doesnt.
Owning shares of a company that produces goods and services that people demands and needs has an undeniable value. No matter in what currency or unit you measure that value in the future.
Dont get me wrong. I am entushiastic about bitcoin too. I own some, along with other assets.
But OP has a valid point to not put all your eggs in a single basket
