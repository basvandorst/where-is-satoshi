Interesting spike in the sea between Africa and South America. Possibly Ascension island? Apparently it's a bit of a communications hub. What does it mean by 'nodes' though? Miners?

Awesome, I didn't realise this forum existed. I'll take a look.

Ok thanks, I was thinking 700-850W would be a reasonable saving in cost anyway.

How big a power supply is needed for a rig with 3x HD5850
I'm looking at 1000W right now to be sure, but I feel it's overkill and if I end up building more than one rig I'd want to keep cost to a minimum.

Aw thanks.

So most people who have commented so far have less than about $US 30? I understand that bitcoins are cool and all but $30 is hardly anything to write home about. Am I missing something here?

Exactly! Everyone seems to be obsessed with the idea of 'investing' in bitcoin. Nobody can be certain the price is going to keep rising. The real selling points are the points you mention. 
I posted a few days ago asking for discussion about whether to 'cash out' some BTC vs. investing (spending) them within the bitcoin market. All I seemed to get was "huuur duurrr you can sell your BTC while I ride the wave to the top".
BTC isn't going to do anyone any good if we all just sit and hoard them hoping for the value to rise.

I'm thinking along the lines of actively investing the BTC on goods/services for profit rather than specualting on the BTC price. I don't need the cash ASAP, but would like to look at options other than currency speculation.

When you mine you point your miner at a url to get your shares. If the website is being DDoSed then your miners can't connect to the pool. It's fucking annoying.

Not full details but I believe the ip linked to his gmail was traced to an internet cafe he used (often) to admin the Silkroad server. He was sshing directly into the server to admin it (not through tor). They probably snooped that connection, saw what server/host he was sshing into and then forced the host to give them access to the server (hosted on US server I guess? WTF was he thinking?).
So the way they seized silk road was not due to cracking tor, but merely a long trail of crumbs leading to a big cookie.

I'm more curious as to why mining pools get DDoSed? What does that achieve?

As an ANZ customer myself, did you tell them to remove the block? I sometimes get blocked when using a VPN, I just call them up, tell them I'm using a VPN and they re-enable internet banking.

Thing is, you don't gain anything until you cash out or transfer the BTC into something else. Nothing wrong with watching the price rise though, all power to you, but IMO ther is more to bitcoin than speculation and I'm keen to look for investment opportunities within the bitcoin market.
@_date: 2013-03-20 01:21:22
Alright, that's pretty interesting. I'm no finance whiz so that goes over my head a bit, but I see where you're coming from. I'm thinking more in in terms of goods and services within the BTC market which I can sell for a profit elsewhere or generate income. E.g rent a VPS server and resell some service etc.

Speculation? What about "saving"?
