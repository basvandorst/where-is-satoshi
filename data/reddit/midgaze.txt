These bots are annoying. Please stop.

Any rational person knows that argument only tells part of the story. When there are lots of holes, lots of holes are discovered.
Remember when Linux guys used to make fun of Windows security, and Windows guys used to use your exact argument to defend Windows?
Edit: constant. stream. of. new. vulnerabilities. FOR YEARS.
 &gt; on average, all pieces of code have the same percentage of bugs. 
Complete and utter nonsense. You just lost any credibility.

Linux is full of holes. Kernel vulnerabilities are published in batches these days, they don't even bother doing an advisory for each one any more.

No, Windows is bad too. I use FreeBSD.

I think that they did a very good job of outlining their concerns.  The EFF is bigger than one single issue, and bitcoin is a lightning rod for some very unwelcome attention.  I think that they know how important it is, collectively, but they exist in a real world and have many brands in the fire.

We're trying to have a serious conversation here.  Can I suggest youtube?

There is one thing (ok, maybe a couple) that I would like people to keep in mind.  First, bitcoin is the first incantation of an idea that could potentially lead us into the future.  I say this because other systems are vulnerable to central control, with all of the corruption that comes with it.  The economic calamities that we have seen recently are a direct result of central authority not doing its job (not properly, not at all.)  The second and more important observation is that the theft of N dollars worth of bitcoins lends credibility to the system.  Think of the analogy of a room full of gold bullion.  If someone breaks into that room and steals off with the gold, it is gone, and there is no central authority to go crying to.  That is the very definition of worth.  Worth can be taken, can be stolen, has immutable value.  We have seen this with bitcoin (kind of, the failure is easy to see and easy to correct.)  The world is not quite ready for bitcoin, as our computers are not as secure as safes yet.  However the idea must not be discarded.  It puts control of the money supply back where it should be, which is in the realm of physical limitation.  Whether that be stripping the Earth of precious metals or computing hard to come by bits, it's stable.  It's beautiful, and it's a path forward.  Let us learn from this and may the next bitcoin be a true replacement for the global money supply.
