I've seen most of his vids but not this one. Nice find. Watching....

What about the privacy for your brother's memory?

You anti-palindromite bastard if we weren't at a wedding I'd knock your teeth out.

A bit on that.One of the big pluses, if you can call it that, is that a huge amount of fentanyl is really compact in size. That's why it's coming in and causing so many problems is the easy of smuggling. This unfortunately is the same reason why people are dying from it; it's so compact that it's difficult to dose accurately, and if you have a lot of fent and not a lot of something else that's more marketable, just to put out something that gets you high is what a lot of dealers resort to, and they do it by throwing in a bit of fent into pills or powder and this is easily misjudged due to how dense it is.

I'm really sick of pretty much everyone in business sucking that guy off.... I remember a talk he gave where he talked about 'knowing the edge of your competency.' He stepped over his, apparently.

There was one account of fakesatoshi's that got found out where he had a whopping 6 bitcoins in it iirc and two transactions: one +6 and one -.25. 
The guy is pathetic and really makes me sick that he's even relevant anymore. I'd love it if I could never hear about him again but over and over he finds a way to keep attracting attention.

One of these days these crypto conmen are going to run a scam on the wrong shibe.

Many generics work similarly to brand names and I can guarantee that I'd be better off funding my psych meds then picking up a opiate habit, insurance never covered my (illicit) drugs and they cost 10x as much.  
I don't think it's right to use your dead brother as a prop to make a point either, that's pretty messed up.

I'm kindof suspicious of this because it just seems like such a weird thing for him to say. I wonder if he's got something behind the scenes with something related to an alt or something else going on that would motivate him to strategically try to tarnish bitcoin like he did.

I remember reading about how the total amount of aid that Gates has given through charitable organizations is something like one-tenth that given by Torvalds.
