I'm al little but annoyed. This seems to be a Dunning Kruger post that essentially defames a prominent member of the community as a liar sitting at +70. Did he mention the NYSE? Laymen think wall street is just the stock market but the bond market is bigger, the derivatives market is bigger. I don't think we should jump to the conclusion that Andreas said 10 billion when he meant 10 million just because of some amateur back of the envelope analysis. At least he should have an opportunity to defend himself for such a big mistake.

See American legal realism. Theres no objective answers to these legal questions based on words. People wont even agree to confine themselves to the words. Theres whole schools of thought debating whether we should interpret the constitution based on what the authors intended or whether it should be a living document. There will be more of this type of ruling in this case. At the end of the day judges have a belief in what they think is right and wrong and it will guide their subjective interpretation of subjective words we call laws.

This is pretty interesting. I was originally thinking why would the government pay someone 80k a year to trash bitcoin? I still don't think they would but I guess maybe someone would? There are indeed accounts on buttcoin that are 100% devoted to talking trash about bitcoin which seems quite strange in terms of the motivation. You can very easily just ignore things you don't like. Its sort of like how I never understand why a song on youtube has even one negative comment since presumably you sought this song out.

I fully expect crypto currencies to replace the dollar. Yes the usd is backed by the current perceived least bad central authority. I think fiat gets overly criticized and actually has some advantages over commodity money and crypto currency is better still.
Edit let me rephrase I think the dollar would be more stable in the long run on a gold standard but in tbe short to medium term it would not be drastically better for its purpose.

I wouldn't do that because you don't need a huge exposure to get rich if you're right. Marc andressen was recently asked why he wasn't investing in bitcoin if he's so bullish and one of the things he said is that the potential magnitude of the space is so great you really can't be too late.  If bitcoin succeeds the way we want we will be rich if we have a few thousand but I wouldn't risk a significant portion of my wealth when there are many ways it can fail and it's unnecessary to have the upside of financial freedom.

Think about what an atrocious burden the AML laws already are on businesses. The U.S. government has essentially deputized any financial business to know the source of all funds of its customers. This trend is growing stronger and there is a trend among U.S. citizens living abroad to give up their citizenship because foreign banks do not want them as customers because of the large regulatory burden placed on them. Even though laws often have names like "consumer protection act..." its hard to ask a community what intelligent regulations they want because they aren't truly written for the people. I read here a lot and I've NEVER seen a post that said X happened to me if ONLY WE HAD REGULATION Y, maybe its the norms of the community and if bitcoin is seen as digital cash then the responsibility is on the individual to treat it responsibly. Take the BAPCPA it was written by credit card companies even though its called "consumer protection act" no community clamored for it, believe me.

It would be spam if it were $10 especially to the people who are just reading and not receiving the tip. If you're reading something interesting you don't want the conversation changed to the fact that someone received bitcoin money. In fact this is something reddit gold does well and it would be nice if there were a tiny b that could be put up in addition to the gold so that you know someone received a tip but it's not distracting and you could click and see from whom and how much.
I still think microtransactions is the point. You're right that it needs to be less spamy and intrusive but big tips aren't the answer. Frankly I think it's awkward and makes you look like you have an agenda to be dropping big public tips on strangers without an exceptionally good reason. 
I also don't think 5 cents is non money. It would have to be a bunch of tiny tips adding up to something before people would start to actually cash out. I personally think they're nice to receive even if they're small but reading as opposed to receiving them is not enjoyable. 1 Satoshi wouldn't insult me it is just a matter of annoying everyone else.

It took me a minute to get what you meant.  It is a good idea. One thing amazon does with discover is it links your reward dollars at checkout you can take your discover cash back right off. For me this has been really valuable because it gets me to actually spend them. Perhaps overstock should partner with changetip and show the ability to pay part out of changetip waiving the 1% fee. Seems like a win win partnership.

I guess I misunderstood you about the efficiency of the market. I'm not concerned about exuberance on the part of a few people who probably wield small money compared to hedge or mutual fund managers. We're either right or were wrong to some extent it's a technical and economic question. You agreed it's likely too high or too low. We should be looking for all the technical reasons for it to fail.
Edit: I am concerned about people taking on risk that will upset them psychologically if Bitcoin fails.  Just not in the sense were seeing a late 90s stock market bubble as Greenspan originally suggested in your reference. I would guess op is sitting on a lot of paper profits and if he can't stand losing it all should diversify. There's lots of fun stocks you can buy too.

It has no impact on bitcoin. It's just him expressing his opinion and now you've expressed yours. Sticky wages are not a huge problem in my opinion. People generally work for the highest wage they can get. They won't refuse to work for some psychological reason if deflation occurs. Deflation is a good thing just look at the computer industry and people working in finance sometimes see less wages one year than they did the last.  That last part about virtually all economists thinking deflation is bad is also wrong. I think you've stated a half a dozen wrong things here but that's not bad for Bitcoin even though you're a "fully paid up bitcoin dreamer. "

I was poking around in and many seem to think there is manipulation by people saying "to the moon" or posting a story that exaggerates the number of retail outlets in Ohio taking Bitcoin. It made me realize that with the size of the market cap it would probably be really hard to manipulate, especially if it grows substantially from where it is now. I'm not sure what kind of things CFTC does about manipulation in silver and gold. I would imagine they are really hard to manipulate despite people saying it happens all the time.

I don't know what your concern is about anarchists hurting the cause and somehow making things worse. Legislation will be created by the two major parties as all legislation is in the U.S. Are you trying to get people's honest opinions or just sound the alarm on regulation coming? If you want people's honest opinion, well yes, some people are anarchists, surprisingly there is a growing number of them online but its a very small contingent of the larger populace so I don't see them causing any harm. I don't think you can adopt this attitude that they are hurting the cause because you see regulation as inevitable. You may be right but they are entitled to their opinion. They also can be right that regulation is stupid and harmful even its inevitable in the imperfect world we live in.

Come on you know that company store link has zero bearing on this discussion. Bitcoin won't replace banking but I think software will and bitcoin is am enabling technology. Companies like prosper and affirm can do lending. At the risk of sounding political the historical legal legacy has created a horrible system in banking. Basically we let banks loan out a bunch of money they don't have, give them property rights when  we deposit money they hold us hostage. All the damage that mt gox did would have been far greater if not only had he lost the money but also loaned out 10x created a global recession and got a taxpayer bailout. I hope fractional reserve never comes to bitcoin and since fractional reserve is fraud on anything other than money it's one good thing about it being legally classified as property.

People are dead wrong when they say the dollar is backed by force. You are forced to total your property accretion over the year in dollars and pay a portion in dollars.  The government demands dollars because it has stable value.  It doesn't have stability or value because the government demands it. If the dollar were losing half its value every year the government would change in method of accounting and potentially in what it demanded. The dollar has value because its use is widespread and limited in supply.  You could use other things as a means of exchange the government simply asks for its cut in dollars at the moment.

Nobody cares about tipping tiny amounts to raise the price of bitcoin. This is a tiny startup which you are pestering. Bitcoin is big now and nobody is trying to shill Bitcoin itself nor were they likely ever but you guys are trying to anti-shill it to fight an imaginary deamon/scam. That I find ironic. 
Heres an example. You don't really see threads here going the other way:
@_date: 2014-09-28 17:31:16
But its a stepping stone. Hypothetically you could start to have people paid in bitcoin once it reaches critical mass and then coinbase and bit pay could become a victim of their own success because if it actually became the world currency everyone uses they are no longer necessary. Of course this is an optimistic scenario but I think it succeeds big if it succeeds or fails completely if it fails.

You started out good. The pocket aces analogy is indeed bad because in that case you have certainty you are making a positive EV bet for any amount of money. However you drifted into the irrational efficient market hypothesis. You would have made the same argument on lack of inside info at the beginning of last year and seen a 50x return. My personal opinion is that bitcoin will go to 0 with some probability but is also likely to succeed and if it is to succeed the market cap must increase emensely and will do so in a series of boom and busts as we have seen so far. Your idea that the market suddenly has it priced just right now is not correct.

Disagree but admire his taking a stand. What messes up austrians is they dont see how well the dollar worked which proves currency doesn't need to be backed. The btc is a better fiat and gold is inferior to dollars as a medium of exchange in the short to medium term. People use dollars to exchange and preserve their wealth in equities. Like it or not that works. 
Edit: when I say it works I dont mean its ideal. Only that it proves currency needs no backing.  The extent the fed restrains supply makes the system adequate.

For almost all crimes there is a state of mind element. For example kill someone intentionally that's murder, recklessly manslaughter, if its just a freak accident where you acted responsibly but killed somone its not a crime. The only exception to this would be something like statutory rape where it is a strict liability offense and you could be told a girl is 18 believe she is 18 but if shes 15 you are commiting a crime. 
The law is different from state to state but they mostly follow something called the model penal code. Actually this case would be governed by some broad federal statute.

In one respect I'd say that the more of a success Bitcoin is the less of a need for companies like Coinbase there should be. If everyone really is their "own bank" and multi-sig and storage can be accomplished by software there is less of a need for Coinbase. If people are being paid and spending in Bitcoin there is eventually no need for conversion to and from dollars.

I'm only half serious about this but a lot of people like to claim that either unlimited, or XT or Core are compromised by government agencies.

Are you a Japanese lawyer? You're saying he doesn't have to distribute the coins legally confidently and I strongly suspect time will prove you wrong. In America there is a concept of unjust enrichment and that certainly would seem to apply to the this case. We are also ignoring a lot. There are other elements of damages, pain and suffering, pre-judgment interest, bailor/bailee law. Why are you so confident that the court is going to arrive at a ruling that flies in the face of justice and common sense and would be a huge black eye on the Japanese legal system?

In the tweet he is responding to the author of that tweet equivocates on the word inflation. This always bugs me. I see this all the time. 
We don't know the "inflation" rate of the USD as defined by increase in supply. We know the "inflation" rate as defined by the CPI. Using a basket of goods CPI method the "inflation" rate of bitcoin has been extremely negative not greater than the ~3% inflation we see in the USD. We can guess at the increase in money supply of the USD through things like M2 M3 etc but we don't know it like we do with BTC and I strongly suspect the inflation as defined an increase in money supply is greater in the USD than the BTC already as well.
When modern economists refer to inflation they are almost invariably referring to the CPI.

I guarantee you I know more about lawsuits than you but, genius, this isn't a court of law. "Being made whole" is a phrase in the English language which essentially means that you are put back in the place you would have been if not for the malfeasance of another. For example if someone destroys your $10,000 car you might make that person whole by giving them $10,000. That is the intention of a lawsuit, to make someone whole. This case is a little more complicated but if you apply some common sense you'll realize that you are not "made whole" by being given the historical value of property taken from you years ago that increased in value substantially.

It's unethical to sell something that you think is a fraud even if you're wrong. But the larger issue is most people hear Dimon say that and think either he is genuine or he's like Kodak railing against digital cameras, he's a middleman and bitcoin cuts him out, etc. If he truly thought it was a fraud like a Madoff style investment scheme he wouldn't knowingly offer it but I think most people see Dimon as insincere or at least emotionally biased against bitcoin. They believe he dislikes bitcoin but don't literally believe he thinks its a fraud. It's been around for years before he decided to call it that, didn't he previously say it would eat their lunch? Now he is calling it a fraud and his company is selling it. Its hard to take that seriously.

The coins are not Mark's. They should be distributed pro rata to the customers. He is a bailee of the property not the owner.

Are you kidding me? He should get nothing. If you loaned someone 2 ounces of gold when it was worth $100 an ounce and he lost one of them and then gold went way $1000 an ounce. Would you be happy to get your $200 back and let the negligent person keep the other $300. It is absolutely preposterous to give someone purely due to their negligence a free option on the price of the underlying good. Just because due to his incompetence he lost a portion of your property doesn't mean he gets the benefits of owning the rest.

If not for his mismanagement of Mt.Gox the customers would have access to their bitcoins. We can agree that due to his carelessness profits that would have gone to customers instead go to him.

You don't have to be a crypto trader.

I've always wondered how much of an impact that kind of examining the supple chain ethics had particularly when you've correctly identified the problem as not being with the consumer.

I agree. His call of the housing bubble is legendary in retrospect but he is weak on technology. The investment community never seems to have gotten over the dot com "bubble" so he also insinuates investments in FB and TWTR as gambling on his radio show. Its a different era now. Both companies are massive advertising platforms. Bitcoin has proven utility in the dark markets. As a libertarian its disappointing hes not more pro-bitcoin.

I understand that you think that Libertarianism leads to monopolies and corporate facism because that's the lie they teach in schools. I encourage you to look at that objectively with an open mind. Larger state power allows for monopolies and corporatism because of regulatory capture, the ability to extend favors, and the ability to enforce monopolies. What you believe is the exact opposite of the truth.

People in countries suffering from the drone strikes tell you that for every drone strike 10 new terrorists are created. So yes you are eliminating terrorists but they only became terrorists because you killed their father brother or friend in many cases. Drug violence has dropped considerably from the 1980s with the falling price of drugs. You can refuse to buy oil, bananas cell phones anything you think might have immorality attached to it. I can see where you're coming from but singling out drugs makes it seem like you're  immoral subjecating immoral laws. Drug dealers voluntarily take on legal risk and we  should have freedom of consciousness so singling out drug users over cell oil gold users etc. Isn't fair and probably comes from a bias that you see no good in them

Why the palm? I'm not saying there's a logical reason to be bothered by that but I would imagine it creeps people out. Honest question is it for KYC laws or something?

To my mind, the best historical examples of full lassez-faire libertarianism are Hong Kong and the early United States. With respect to the United States I do think its a lie taught in schools with respect to monopolies abusing the public during some period of history. The reason is because companies like standard oil never jacked up the prices and abused the public. Indeed, if they did they would lose market share. Rather their prices were extremely low and competitors got the government to step in. The concerns seem to have been largely hypothetical even in an environment where government hand outs helped drive those monopolies into existence. Assuming Hong Kong and the early United States are success stories where are the failures?

I wouldn't debate the price as much as the utility of the protocol. The price is an unknown and he could even be right about the potential for it to crash. Even things that end up having a lasting impact such as the automobile or the dot-coms were at one point net negative for investors. Couldn't this be true for bitcoin? Schiff is opposed to the war on drugs and I assume the income taxes so he should see some positive even if the price were a bubble.

I disagree, I think he just didn't give a shit about it and was agnostic on the protocol in particular which is his tendency as well. It's major trends that he thinks are predicable. One thing I've noticed in his interviews is that he tends to ignore the question and talk about what he finds interesting. If anyone challenges him he just comes across as bored anyway. When you think about his world view, which I happen to agree with, it takes a lot to get you excited.

I'm so shocked that this is going on in the uk. Do people use VPN and tor to get around this?

The author says gold is a libertarian Ponzi scheme too. Weird point of view.
