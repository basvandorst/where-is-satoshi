You mean a $1,000 mark up for one whole bitcoin??

I’m lost on this transferring fee. 
When I bought my bitcoins on an exchange, there wasn’t a transfer fee for transfer my BTC to my digital wallet, only a fee to buy and sell bitcoins on the exchange. 
I’d imagine bitcoin ATMS operate the same way.

I understand what you mean that it doesn’t seem very secure but just to clarify, it is possible to have access to one BTC wallet on several different devices?

True but it’s pretty hard to estimate how many lost coins are actually in the system. So it might be hard to factor that in to the price of bitcoin.

Right, but I meant a Nano ledger that can plug in to your phone to protect your wallet. 
Or does it have to have to have a USB port for the Nano ledger to work?

Is that all?

Right but by the time they deposit the cash at a bank and buy the bitcoins on an exchange, the price would most likely have changed by then.

What do you mean transfer rates? 
Are you saying it’s actually cheaper to buy at a Bitcoin ATM than it is to buy on a exchange?

But doesn’t transaction fees defeat one of the main purposes of bitcoin?
