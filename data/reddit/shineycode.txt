It's common in Nevada too, suburbs surrounding Vegas

As a programmer, thats the best way. The ones with passion don't want to be told how to do it, just the end goal. We'll make it happen :)

How does this work? Do you get redemption codes from publishers that you are selling?
@_date: 2014-06-20 04:13:33
*to the beat* We're gonna oggle it anyway

If turbo tax started...that's be interesting for sure. I guess we need set laws though first.

No �� card. They didn’t take bitcoin

Bought it ~10 minutes before Bitcoin hit the threshold

Send in the CLOOOONE!!!

Maybe he's just butthurt he didn't get in it

I use one now called Bitcoin Bleep: 
The only use it for getting push notifications to show on the homescreen, never open it otherwise. Have other apps when I want to view more information that work better. It'd be cool if this was my one stop app!
Please be sure to allow choosing an exchange, I'm a coinbase user myself, bleep only does MtGox
@_date: 2013-12-15 02:09:03
If done this way, allow us to choose which exchange's price we want. There can be huge differences between them, I've seen over $100 difference on btc-e to coinbase before. Even right now it's a $50 difference.

Only an idiot would use that combination on their luggage!
@_date: 2013-12-29 08:06:15
Do it! Just be sure to watch for pulls and submit App Store updates every now and then for the public :-)
@_date: 2013-12-12 22:18:28
That is so awesome! I may have to order a card just for the hell of it :)

Just saw this post which shows the risk of even having the api key enabled:

See, when people said to the moon, I assumed they meant Europa, not the lame ass Earth moon.

Well even on coinbase you could enter your banks username and password to get accounts linked faster.
@_date: 2013-12-28 23:02:45
Well done! As a fellow iOS dev, it looks great! Simple, which I'm a fan of :) Let me know if you need any help!

*drops mic*
@_date: 2013-12-15 01:11:17
I'm having issues too. I guess we'll have to wait and see. As said, may be the two-factor problem.
I'll try every now and then and update here on any progress.
@_date: 2013-12-29 00:12:34
Only feedback from immediate look at the site is to add Coinbase price. Lot's of people use it. If it is in it already, add it to the front of the site with the charts at the bottom to make that clear.
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:19:47
I think the word stretching needs at least 17 more e's in it for this situation.
@_date: 2013-12-30 15:49:28
Why am I not surprised?
@_date: 2013-12-29 04:26:29
The site loaded slow, the CSS took a while to get to me which made the whole thing look wonky. I didn't look to far in, just a glance
@_date: 2013-12-11 05:54:37
Any plans to add roulette in the future (same or different site)? Tis typically my poison of choice.
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:05:27
Just too cool. Wish I had enough to pick one up!
@_date: 2013-12-15 07:36:03
So I am now asked to enter the verification code sent to my phone. I get the number, and enter it, and then has a sign in problem again. It's a step forward though!
@_date: 2013-12-26 16:08:05
Much wow. Such cool. My oops. No doge.
But seriously, these are some impressive setups.
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:36:45
I have some dog shit to sell. Anyone know how to make a good kick starter video?
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:24:47
I did that for a while but found it cumbersome. I wish I kept at it. How long have you been at it?
@_date: 2013-12-15 01:17:56
I'm curious on peoples thoughts on email/password VS. api key
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:17:30
 is my new favorite. It works with all the major exchanges
@_date: 2013-12-12 15:57:21
Exactly. I am curious though, that police officer or whoever that was getting paid in Bitcoin, do you think he was holding onto it in Bitcoin or converting it right away?
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:16:46
Very interesting read. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:02:56
MATH!
