A couple of questions:
(1) What does it mean to say "BIP38 is built into the protocol"?
I saw a comment on bitcoin.stackexchange.com that seemed to be suggesting that "software based wallets are starting to support the importation and sweeping of BIP38 encoded cold wallets":
But I haven't heard any news of any wallets which have actually implemented this as of yet.
(2) When you say "throttling" does this mean that there are many "rounds" of encryption or hashing applied, making it a bit slower to generate (and to attempt to brute-force) a private key? 
I thought I saw something about multiple rounds here:
But re-reading it now (and doing Control-F) I can't find the word "round" on the page, so maybe I'm getting confused with some other encryption spec I was reading recently.
(3) I hear a lot of about people talking about encrypting their wallets and then uploading them to the "cloud" (Google Docs, Drop Box, email, etc.)
This is of course a technique I already use a lot for other sorts of important but not terribly security-sensitive information (lists of phone numbers backed up via USB from my cell phone, sign-in info for non-essential various sites - anything kinda important I want to be able to access anytime and anywhere).
Now I'm conflicted about doing this sort of thing with my *bitcoin private keys* (even if heavily encrypted).
- On the one hand, it certainly would be nice to have one's coins available in encrypted form "in the cloud" (as long as I can remember the BIP38 password - which I understand can be fairly short! :-)
- On the other hand, this seems to violate the general security notion of minimizing *physical* access to sensitive data / money, as well as the bitcoin-specific notion of "cold storage".
Maybe it's six of one, half a dozen of the other? 
- When you upload your BIP38-encrypted private keys, you've got some encrypted stuff in the cloud - and you can unlock it using a passphrase (which you keep safely on you - guarding physical access).
- When you do cold storage, you've got your bitcoins on the blockchain (which includes having your *public addresses* "in the cloud", eg on blockchain.info) - and you can unlock your bitcoins using your private keys (which you again keep safely on you - guarding physical access).
But I guess the difference is, BIP38 adds another "layer" of indirection (the BIP38 password) to this whole thing:
- If you upload your BIP38-encrypted private keys, they're meaningless to any busybodies or attackers (ie they can't be tracked back to the original private keys that generated them, or to any transactions or public addresses).
- If you do cold storage using unencrypted paper backups, then what's "in the cloud" (ie, your public addresses and your transaction id's, available on eg blockchain.info) is moderately trackable back to you (say, if you didn't use Tor while doing transactions, your IP address and hence your physical address might publicly be associated with your bitcoin public address).
So (forgive me for thinking out loud here), it seems that BIP38 provides an extra "layer" to thwart attackers. 
In both cases (BIP38-encrypted private keys uploaded to cloud, vs unencrypted cold paper wallets), you have some "secret" on you that you have to guard physical access to.
But there is a difference between the two scenarios:
- Say someone gains physical access to your secret BIP38 passphrase. This still does them no good, because **they don't know which encrypted private keys it pertains to.**
- Say you're have an unencrypted cold paper wallet, and someone gains access to this. Now they can steal your coins, since info they have access to is "complete" (they can install the corresponding wallet program from scratch, plug in the unencrypted cold paper wallet, and steal your coins).
So I am kinda liking BIP38 - due to this extra "layer" it adds.
Anyways, does this mean I'm being crazy-paranoid for *not* keeping my bitcoins in the cloud (in BIP38-encrypted form)??
I don't know, maybe I got carried away reading about cold storage a few years ago, and I kinda got stuck on that approach.
Also consider: A big exchange with millions of USD in BTC wouldn't simply BIP38-encrypt it and upload it to the cloud, would they? That would seem crazy - they're supposed to use cold storage.
So why do we insist that exchanges should use cold storage - while for individuals we think it's ok to simply BIP38-encrypt and upload to the cloud?
Maybe people feel that there is some kind of cutoff point where having "lots" of BTC dictates cold storage and having "somewhat less" BTC allows BIP38-encrypted cloud backups?

Thanks for this info.
Long-term, I do actually intend to use Armory for hierarchical-deterministic (HD) and paper wallet backups. I have Armory installed on 2 Ubuntu machines (one online and one offline), and it's currently downloading the blockchain (which looks like it could take a week or so).
My current needs are kinda weird and specific: I don't intend to be spending for a while (so HD wallets are not a big priority at the moment), but I do need some added security right away (in the next couple days).
I tend to take a conservative approach regarding security - avoiding installing new stuff.
In particular, I have heard that Electrum sends your addresses to the server you're connected to:
So for the moment, I just want to avoiding researching / installing new software - and encrypt my bitcoin-qt wallet.dat file (possibly using a few unicode characters), make some new backups, and continue hoarding lol.
Actually, this made me think of another question:
**Can I encrypt my bitcoin-qt wallet.dat file on a machine that is *offline* (and that doesn't have the blockchain downloaded)?**

Hi, thank you, it was actually your use of ♥ in your BIP38 challenge that gave me the idea to also try putting some unicode characters into the bitcoin-qt wallet.dat passphrase as well :-)
Regarding BIP38 - do you have any recommendation(s) as to which wallet(s) implementing BIP38 you like?
I'm not really into JavaScript as a general-purpose programming language so it really wouldn't feel quite right downloading one of those navigator-based paper-wallet-creation sites and using one of them (although I did download one a few years back and play around with it a bit). 
JavaScript does fine for *browser-specific* tasks, but I would feel safer using a BIP38 paper wallet generator based on a more general-purpose language which already has extensive crypto libraries (in particular to ensure that the random numbers for the private keys generated are *cryptographically secure*). I understand that there are several libraries in C++ for example which do this.
Also, I have heard that there may be some implementations of BIP38 which allow creating an encrypted paper wallet based on an *existing* private key. This would also be an interesting option, since I'm still just hodling for now (in a wallet which is kinda-sort "cold" - i.e. it was only on a "hot" internet-connected laptop initially years ago when initially purchasing the coins and was immediately moved offline to multiple local copies on storage media which was never again inserted into an internet-connected device) and it would be great if I could avoid having to briefly move these coins online again, when all I really want to do at the moment is encrypt their private keys.

OK, I see what you're saying. 
But actually I was just thinking back to the recent contest involving BIP38, where there was a 4-character unicode password, that took over a year to brute-force (due to the sheer number of unicode characters out there).
I think the password in that case was something like 1♥฿. (using the ฿ which actually stands for Thai currency, since unicode doesn't actually have a unicode character for "bitcoin" yet).
This made me think that it would be pretty easy to strategically throw a few unicode characters into a passphrase - to make it harder to bruteforce, while still remaining easy to memorize.
But mainly what I'm worried about, regarding the possibility of using a few unicode characters in a bitcoin-qt wallet password, is whether they'll actually get read and processed correctly by bitcoin-qt itself.
I figure I could type up the password in some text editor and copy-and-paste it into the 2 "create passphrase" fields in bitcoin-qt - but since all that shows up in password fields is the usual sequence of ••• bullet characters (and since I have seen nothing in the bitcoin-qt documentation explicitly stating whether it supports unicode passphrases), then I would not feel 100% reassured that bitcoin-qt was interpreting the characters correctly.
Also, some unicode characters apparently come in multiple variants. This could make it difficult to type in a unicode password correctly.
Still, I like the vastly larger "pool" of character unicode offers - it just seems great for passwords, to thwart brute-force attempts.

Thanks. I should confess I've installed only Armory so far because everyone was saying that it's for paranoid power-users (and I figure I qualify, since I've done some programming here and there, and I was actually able to do my own rudimentary "audit" of Armory's C++ and Python source a few months ago, trying to re-assure myself mainly that the crypto parts looked legit).
Of course I've heard a lot about Electrum too. I guess the reason I haven't installed it yet is because it sounded like it was "lightweight" in some ways (SPV) versus the image Armory has of being more "industrial-strength" - but I realize that could just be a perception on my part. (Although I should also add that my usual strategy when dealing with software is very defensive: just go with what's simplest, as this often also turns out to be the safest).
There was some report about Electrum sending the user's bitcoin addresses to the server:
I don't know how important this actually is from a security perspective. (Aren't addresses fairly public anyways, and already associated with my IP address if I'm not using Tor?)
Meanwhile, there was also some report that Armory was collecting (hashed) user info:
Again I'm not sure how significant this is from a security perspective. (Evidently only a unique hash of the user's info is being collected.)
**Long-term,** my main security goal is of course to have offline (cold) storage, plus hierarchical-deterministic wallets and paper backups. 
(It would be nice if Armory also offered BIP 38 to encrypt the paper backups, and if it used a standard implementation of hierarchical-deterministic wallets. I'm not sure if any wallet software does all these things yet.)
My old, existing bitcoin-qt wallet is kinda-sorta "cold" storage already - it was created years ago (on a Windows machine, unfortunately - but a fairly clean one, I hope :-), and a few weeks later it was copied to multiple "cold" digital storage devices, and the original local "hot" copies were deleted from the Windows machine (and hopefully the physical file space has over time been sufficiently trashed and overwritten on my almost-full hard drive in order to make that old deleted wallet.dat file forensically or hacker-ly unrecoverable from the Windows machine).
**Short-term** I just want some additional simple security without having to research and install too much stuff - so this is why I was thinking of just putting a passphrase on the bitcoin-qt wallet.dat file, without having to learn how to properly use Armory or Electrum at the moment.
Also, for now and the foreseeable future, I'm still going to be only hoarding / hodling, so there will be no need for any transactions whatsoever at the moment - aside from whatever transactions may be needed to move the coins into long-term cold storage at some point soon (eg, on Armory or Electrum).
So I'm tempted to go ahead and just encrypt the bitcoin-qt wallet.dat file now since this takes almost no effort (and back up this new file onto multiple offline devices) - in order to buy some time to really learn the ins and outs of other wallets like Armory and Electrum.

Thanks. I do have 2 Armory machines - one online and offline. They're running a slightly older version of Armory (0.91.2), so I might want to update that first.
This version isn't terribly old - it's actually new enough to be able to offer to do a secure download to update Armory. But I probably wouldn't want to do any sort of download onto the *offline* machine anyways - so I'll probably take a bit of time to upgrade Armory on both machines, downloading a 'deb' package for the offline machine, if such a thing is still available, or maybe I'll want to build Armory from source 
By the way, I also heard there was some weird thing in Armory where it was collecting data from users ie reporting the user's IP address to the Armory organization for marketing / survey purposes, and I wanted to look more into that before actually using Armory, and make any changes to maximize privacy.
I also wanted to look into using Tor before doing any sending, so as not to give away my geographic location. 
So much stuff to figure out still.
But anyways, if I understand you correctly: you're saying I could create a wallet on the *offline* Armory machine (with no blockchain downloaded), put a password on this Armory wallet, and send some coins there from bitcoin-qt.
I assume you mean:
- really doing a *"send"*, sending them *over the network in the normal fashion via the blockchain* (in which case I believe the new Armory wallet can actually be *hierarchical-deterministic*, since Armory *itself* created the private keys based on the HD "master" code), and 
- *not* merely doing a "sweep" importing the coins (essentially "offline") locally from the bitcion-qt wallet into the Armory wallet (in which case the Armory wallet would *not* be HD, since it would necessarily contain keys which *weren't* generated using Armory's particular HD scheme).
I guess this makes sense. 
And even while *Armory* doesn't have the full blockchain downloaded yet, I guess I could simply check the addresses on *blockchain.info* to see if the coins are there.
Now this brings up yet another question: 
Assuming my bitcoin-qt client doesn't have the blockchain downloaded yet - but I *do* of course have my original wallet.dat file containing my coins: 
**Is it possible to send coins from a bitcoin-qt client which doesn't have a local copy of the blockchain yet?**
In other words, if blockchain-qt has the *wallet* (with the private keys), but it doesn't have the *blockchain* (with the worldwide transaction history), can bitcoin-qt send out coins?
I'm guessing that it could. 
As far as I understand, having the wallet.dat containing the private keys simply means that the bitcoin-qt client "broadcasts the attempted spend to the network" - and as long as the *signature* of the spend is determined to be valid (by being based on the private key, which is in the wallet.dat file), then this is all that matters - since the distributed consensus is worked out by the miners *on the global blockchain* in order to decide whether to actually confirm the transaction (and isn't based on my *local copy of the blockchain*).

Thank you for this detailed answer.
So let me see if I understood you correctly:
If I simply:
(1) Install and launch the latest version of bitcoin-qt
(2) Swap in my old, existing, unencrypted wallet.dat file
(3) Use the Settings menu in bitcoin-qt to add encryption (passphrase) to this wallet.dat file
(4) Keep my old (unencrypted) wallet.dat backups around just for the hell of it - with the understanding that as soon as I start *doing transactions* using the new wallet.dat file, then the backups of the old wallet.dat file will no longer be fully up-to-date (since change will be getting sent to new addresses in the newly encrypted file - addresses which didn't even exist in the old, unencrypted file).
So if I proceed as above, I should be good?
Also (as someone suggested [elsewhere in this thread](
(5) If I'm not actually sending/receiving (just encrypting), then evidently I can even encrypt the old wallet.dat file while this particular node running bitcoin-qt has *not yet downloaded the whole blockchain?*
@_date: 2015-04-06 18:52:02
Yeah I think Armory's HD implementation is still home-grown (non-standard).
@_date: 2015-04-06 16:08:55
Wow, this is interesting stuff, thanks for these links, I will read up on them.
Edit: Whoa, that Stone Man case is really tragic - guy bought 9,000 BTC in 2010 running from a LiveCD, sent 1 BTC, closed down the LiveCD (erasing the in-memory file system, including /.bitcoin) - and so he lost the wallet containing the new change address!
@_date: 2015-04-06 19:03:44
This might actually be the optimal approach for me, based on my current, specific short-term needs (ie, I just want to get some extra security for my existing wallet.dat file which I never encrypted way back when, and I'm not planning on actually sending or receiving any coins for the foreseeable future). 
My time is kinda limited right now, and if I can avoid researching and installing other wallet software such as Armory or Electrum (which always ends up taking me several days to do since I tend to obsess over double-checking everything, perusing the source code and possibly even building from it, trying to remember how to install Ubuntu debs on an offline machine, dealing with the PGP keys and MD5 hashes, reading up on the latest news to see if there have been any problems, etc.) **and** if I can avoid having to download the entire blockchain merely to encrypt this existing, briefly-once-upon-a-time "hot" bitcoin-qt wallet.dat file... then that would at least be a small step forward in terms of security at the moment, enough to satisfy my current needs with minimal effort, and then I can deal with Electrum or Armory later for a longer-term truly cold storage solution.

With all due respect, I think the math would suggest otherwise.
Say unicode (2.0) has about 10,000 characters, versus about 256 for ascii.
So to brute-force a 20-character passphrase which includes some ascii characters - eg ♥ - you would need to look at:
256^20 = 1461501637330902918203684832716283019655932542976
possibilities - versus:
10000^20 = 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
possibilities to brute-force a passphrase which might include some unicode characters.
Meanwhile, sprinkling a few characters like ♥ in a passphrase probably wouldn't make it psychologically much more difficult for a human to memorize.
