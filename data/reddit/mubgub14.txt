Which Waves is it at by the way? Article says 17 Ave. But there's two Waves on there as far as I know...

This post is a great example of how Bitcoin truly is amazing. :)
But... for what it's worth: in Canada, we have the ability to email money to anyone instantly - using only their email address - via Interac (our debit network), of which every single bank is a member. 
It's slick, and very prevalent. Most landlords accept it instead of cheques nowadays, and friends use it to pay back small expenses as well.

Assuming nothing has changed in the last day or two, you will now be joining ME as the second Bitcoin friendly business (per Coinmap) in Calgary!
Will drop in very soon!

**Not exactly true. But we already know that.**


**Would it be humanly possible for you to make this sound nerdier, geekier, or more stupid than you just did?**
Rare strains? Computer code? Cyber space? Jesus. Head on back to the '90's.
I seriously hate traditional media. OP, I hope you slapped that reporter. But other than that, well done!

Great idea! :)

Can't remember if I have a balance or not. Guess we'll see!

I replied to the initial message and said "Are you sure this isn't a scam?", and received the following
Absolutely not, and it is totally voluntary/optional. We will be having releasing a formal presser Monday morning once we have a better idea of our position with the "shares" so to speak. So far the interest has been absolutely phenomenal. We understand investing in anything is always a risk vs. reward scenario.. so it might be worth thinking it over. But we've crunched the numbers, and things are looking great. There is a lot on the horizon for Reddit and we're confident about our position in this space.
Best of luck!

My issue with the portable version (Windows), is that it doesn't remember the wallet.dat you last had opened. This is a pain for me, as everytime I open it, I have to go File &gt; Open, and re-point it to my real wallet. 1.8 didn't have these issues.

There is no "A" in "definitely".
You can remember this by the rule:

I only mention it, because I'm still waiting for mine :)

Sent you a PM.

The idea that people still pay for porn is absolutely *baffling* to me.

Good site, but maybe worth noting somewhere that withdrawals have to be manually approved, and take 24 hours.

If you're in Calgary, I'll buy some :)

Septuple. New word of the day!

I really hope one of these will come to Calgary soon!

Seriously, is it from Beetlejuice or The Departed?

Can someone please explain to me how to actually *use* a BIP38 encrypted key, when the time comes to get money out of the wallet? How does one use, say, Electrum to do that?
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:55:36


Does my network card support this protocol?
@_date: 2013-04-27 03:42:16
Weird. The user information and reply link look pretty much legitimate. But the content just screams "scam!"

As a Calgarian, I strongly approve this message! Now if only Virtex didn't charge their ridiculous fees...
@_date: 2013-04-25 22:22:33
This is exactly why Virtex doesn't take any kind of electronic form of payment. Unless you're verified with government ID, and physical utility bills.
Also, I do recommend Virtex. They're very good, and based out of Calgary. Had no issues, and had BTC within 6 hours of making a cash deposit.

You're running Windows 8. Windows Defender (Microsoft Security Essentials) is built-in. Remove McAfee and be done with it.

Your username is oddly fitting.

Pretty small admittedly. All of our consultants (myself included) have day-jobs. But flexible scheduling allows us to run this small business on the side. Hopefully, eventually, one day, maybe - we'll be able to bring in enough to do it full-time!
