Tldr: likes bitcoin, doesn't like people who don't.

This is the only bitcoin purchasing that I do. It has good variability, and can be bought in chunks of almost any value you want. Processing time can be an issue though (from my limited experience), but I'm sure that will improve with time

Well, it's possible that the 'recovery' is just a small group of wealthy people propping up the price while lots of people try and sell. Downward price pressure from all those sellers could be hard to stop, if their pockets aren't deep enough. Or maybe they feel that $600 is high enough

Australian government employee here.
In Australia we have a Federal Gov't: we have a number of states that have joined together. In ye olde days, the government could print money, but these days there's an independent central bank. If a government wants more money it can either change taxes, or sell bonds for currency people already have. But neither the state governments nor the Commonwealth government can just print more.
But in this instance (from a gov't perspective) it's a ceased asset, being sold by (a police-like section of government) from the state of Victoria. That one state has no real control over any kind of currency, and that Gov't Department has its own budgets. So it's just selling off something it's ceased, in the same way that it would sell off a whole bunch of cars or properties, and then it will use that money to do other things (e.g. expand operatoins, pay peoples' wages etc.)
