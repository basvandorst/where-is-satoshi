It'll probably go rightways as VC enters the market but the first, or possibly second 2015 ATC will cause the price of bitcoin to go leftwards upto and until another major firm accepts bitcoin as a form of payment.

With difficulty of 13,462,580,114.525, it will take on average 860,103,251,028,279,476,768 hashes to find a block.
An antminer U2 does 2,000,000,000 hashes a sec.
U2 hash divided by total hash means it will take 430,051,625,515 seconds to find a block.
600 sec (avg network block time)/430,051,625,515 sec =
0.0000001395% chance of finding a block.
Dividing U2 hash by total network hashrate will give you a probability of  about 0.00000175795%.
Not sure which one is correctly calculated, but in essence You a playing a lottery by buying a single small ticket while everyone else is buying them by the hundreds or thousands.
**TL;DR**: No.

That is how I am looking at bitcoin too. If bitcoin is worthless I the future, well, I'll be kinda bummed out but it probably won't make or break me. On the other hand, if I'm sitting on a fortune, that would be pretty nice.

There was a thread of KnC rigs arriving with missing pieces, heatsinks being held on the boards with only thermal paste, fans attached with rubber bands, etc. If you are willing to take a risk with a company with that kind of QC, if any, and you are willing to participate in an experimental currency, then by all means go ahead. No one is stopping you from doing anything. Sorry if this sounds a bit harsh, but thats just my two satoshis.

Top quality post...
@_date: 2015-07-12 15:34:33
This right here. The reason air cooling works is because new (cooler) air replaces the warmed air forced away with fans. Liquid immersion cooling works the same way but with a fluid other than water (mineral oil?). Mining in space would not work because there would be no medium, or at least no where near enough to proper cool the miner. You could mine on mars because it has some sort of atmosphere that won't completely destroy the miner (unlike Venus). The only problem is that it would take longer than 10 minutes for information, in this case a new block, to reach mars in some parts of the orbit.
TL;DR: There is no suitable place to mine in space because heat is an issue and planets are too far away.
EDIT: I forget word.

Doge coin are currently divisible to the eighth decimal place. Greater precision/divisibility can be included in an update if needed.

When my friends ask me how bitcoin holds value, I respond by asking them how the dollar or euro or whatever holds value. They hold value because people believe that they hold value, and trust that they will continue to hold that value.
