Hello. I have some free terabytes on a synology NAS + gigabyte optic fibre with 200 mb upload
Can I use this to mine directly from the NAS, or do I need to share the space with another computer ?
Where do I start to join now ?
I would be happy to have some of your coins giveaway + early acces to mining software and could add 8TB with very fast unlimited connection

There is still a fully fonctional offline wallet that can be used on iphone, I'm not sure that it would be a good idea to say the name here (I want to continue to receive updates), I Don't think they have figured the payment system works with Bitcoin. The word Bitcoin is not writen on app description. It involves buying a card from a swiss compagny...
The day they have banned blockchain app, I have removed my credit card from my apple ID.
PS: I can give you the app name by message if you need a good wallet on iphone

I have applyed for a preorder. I think the product is very good, open software, open hardware. For backup, I think it will be like hardware wallet from BTChip. The first time you initiate the card, a seed is shown on screen (like trezor or any BIP32 wallet) so you write it down, and if you lose or erase the card (entering too much false pin) you initiate the card again, entering the seed and it's restored.
I think this devise is a very good thing, I can't wait to have my portable pgp messaging device.

Yup, I don't choose this one to be nsa proof, but I don't want to quit Apple to give my data to google, so for me, the idea is to use an android phone disconnected from google. And also, be abble to stop beeing spammed by adds, as you may know, with an iPhone, it's difficult to remove adds.
For security and anonymity, I will give a look to tails mobile when it will be ready.

Do they make law for all the world?
Imagine all countries creating laws impacting the whole world, it would be such a mess.
World will have to end cooperation with us laws if this is the new trend.

Is there a minimal investment to have access to early network ?
Do you plan to release a synology package easy to install on it ?
Do mining reward system takes connection speed in account when mining?

This is exactly how I see future of Bitcoin.
Let's buy some centralized dollarcoin to buy my coffee ;) and keep holding my savings in bitcoins.

You mean murder and terror ?
@_date: 2015-11-12 14:26:52
To peg value to 1btc, I need to be able to deliver bitcoins (or the peg is BS) So you will have to transact in Bitcoin's blockchain
@_date: 2015-11-21 08:52:59
So bad you didn't succeed to kill Bitcoin with gigablocks.
R3 would have gone to the moon. Good luck with r3 and please now, mess with your altcoin and never come back.

To have a way to move value from chains. If you chose a sidechain, maybe you will want your bitcoins back on blockchain. That's why
@_date: 2015-11-11 11:07:46
2015  year of the short in Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-11-02 07:24:45
The key to the blockchain is corruption of banks and goverment
They are the keys
@_date: 2015-11-12 14:27:50
That only mean transacting in layer 0 will be expensive.
And some will have to.

It's actually funny. I can see blythe in 2 years

Use hexidices to generate private key  use offline bitaddress.org to compute public key

What would be huge is openbazar killing ebay.
@_date: 2015-11-02 06:57:48
And... It's gone
@_date: 2015-11-07 15:36:29
Or maybe r/Bip101 or r/hearn
@_date: 2015-10-30 22:29:45
Yeah, who knows.
But it would not be so huge that ebay integrate btc in 2016.
Who really cares about ebay now ?

Hello, I'm a user of your product, and I think the Hardware RNG is not used, maybe i'm wrong, but maybbe it would be good if you check, and activate it if it's not activated
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:57:54
Sorry for your lose. You should consider using Revlar paper for your futur wallets.
