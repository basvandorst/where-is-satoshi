Lets hope you have done your homework on the civil war raging within the community. The potential of a hard folk. How full blocks will effect bitcoin later this year. And the potential price fall if the ETF applications are rejected. The shift of developers and investors to another coin if it activates segwit within the next few months and bitcoin doesn't. Let's hope you have done your homework rather than just jumped in because of the hype.

The last day of the period so computed shall be included unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal legal holiday (as defined in Rule 104), in which event the period runs until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal legal holiday. Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal legal holidays shall be excluded from the computation when the period of time prescribed or allowed is seven days or less, not including any additional time allowed for service by mail in paragraph (b) of this rule. If on the day a filing is to be made, weather or other conditions have caused the Secretary's office or other designated filing location to close, the filing deadline shall be extended to the end of the next day that is neither a Saturday, a Sunday, nor a Federal legal holiday.
(b) Additional Time For Service by Mail. If service is made by mail, three days shall be added to the prescribed period for response.

Donald Trump's next job: avoid government shutdown
US President Donald Trump is trying to revive his presidency after the healthcare debacle, but before nailing tax reform he will need to avert a government shutdown.
The potential for a government closure is not high on the radar of Wall Street, but is a sleeper issue in the Washington Beltway.
The same group of renegade conservatives who blocked Trump's effort to overturn Obamacare are agitating for a potential government shutdown near the end of April unless their hardline demands are met, according to Washington insiders.
"Hello April 29 government shutdown," Washington political analyst Chris Krueger wrote in a note to clients overnight.
"We do not buy the 'health care failing is sneaky bullish because we can now do taxes' argument."
The ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus is likely to tie extending the government's budget to defunding a family planning organisation that offers health screening, contraception and abortion.
The group of about three-dozen conservative lawmakers oppose the public funding of Planned Parenthood because it helps women have abortions.
With the funding of the government only legislated until April 28, the group is tipped to use Planned Parenthood as a bargaining chip to extend the budget.
But Democrats and moderate Republicans will never agree to the blackmail attempt, setting up a likely showdown.
Top political commentator Mike Allen of Axios reported that the White House and Republicans were "scrambling" to defuse the "shutdown bomb".
"A top Republican with close ties to the White House tells me that after the GOP failure on healthcare, a government shutdown — looming when a continuing resolution runs out April 28 — is 'more likely than not... Wall Street is not expecting a shutdown and the markets are unprepared'," Allen wrote.
A government shutdown in April would send another bad signal to markets—after the healthcare failure—about Trump's capacity to negotiate on pledged tax cuts, infrastructure investment and deregulation.
A shutdown means many federal government departments are closed and workers are not paid, except for agencies performing critical functions such as defence and emergency services.
The last time the government shutdown was in October 2013 when Republicans tried to repeal the Obamacare health insurance safety net.
Markets initially reacted calmly to the 16-day standoff but later began selling off at the prospect of the US refusing to lift its debt limit and defaulting on its sovereign debt.
The debt ceiling was eventually lifted only hours before the default deadline when Republicans caved into president Barack Obama.
Earlier this month the "soft" debt ceiling of $US19.9 trillion passed when the US Treasury dipped into reserve funds to pay creditors.
The "hard" debt ceiling deadline is forecast to expire around October, in a potential more serious showdown between ultra conservatives and the White House.
President Trump has signalled he is willing to deal with Democrats to move legislation through Congress and not be beholden to the House Freedom Caucus.
However, Democratic Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer has warned the left-leaning party will not pass a budget resolution that includes funding for Trump's wall on the US-Mexico border or defunding Planned Parenthood.

Green ticks are segwit mined blocks on Litecoin. LTC1BTC, Antpool, and LTCTop flipped a few hours ago to signal segwit ... and within days it's extremely likely Litecoin will have Segwit locked in. Two weeks after that, Litecoin should have the Lightning Network up ... to be followed by confidential transactions, smart contracts etc etc. 
This is massive and hopefully scares the shite out of the bitcoin community. So much so, they too achieve segwit a.s.a.p.

As for Litecoin's development, practically all shinny things for Bitcoin are easily transferred to Litecoin. All merchant acceptance for Bitcoin is easily expanded for Litecoin use.

I thought of flipping out yet what if it's not completely safe to buy back ... yet with segwit activated, Bitcoin skyrockets in value.
