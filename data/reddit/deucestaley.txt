Because they are...

This is by far the weirdest meme that's been on here.  Not really sensical either...

This isn't going anywhere.  Personally, having a shitty job would motivate me to get a better one.

If you think the majority of people are working 60 + minimum wage hours, you may be out of touch...

Just a fundamental difference.  I believe he has all those things because of his work ethic.  He doesn't have a work ethic because he was already rich.

Exactly....  I would upvote 100 times.  Someone who sat around and is given a wage will not have motivation to do the things Elon does.

LoL did you read your own post?  Literally all that is motivation...

Debit cards...  A credit card is literally a card for things you don't have money for.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:02:05
How howwww
@_date: 2019-10-11 10:55:29
No it doesn't

All I need are my Bitcoins...  And this lamp!  And maybe this thermus...
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:32:54
I am a brand new coin owner and lurker, and I do have to agree with you.  It's a bit silly now...
That being said, I LOVE roller coaster guy...
@_date: 2019-12-13 21:20:02
Looks like mine lol
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:25:22
Too legit

You misread the quote ...

It's not, he's lying...
