A hawker gambler or swindler is by definition trying to get money out of their victim. Any accomplice of theirs would clearly have something to gain as well, unless they are some slave doing the bidding of their swindler master. Shills are paid to spread misinformation.

From my understanding there is a large amount of people unable to voice their disapproval because the mods hand out bans regularly for any dissent
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:56:59
Then I guess everyone posting screenshots of the things they get banned for are editing the context huh

Ill definitely share the next couple I see, not gonna spend time hunting down old examples. However what is the definition of shilling in this sub? Is merely stating the name of an alt coin shilling? My understanding is that term is to be reserved for those paid to spread a message, which I am pretty certain none of the examples I have seen would meet that definition.
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:16:24
Google defines it as 
an accomplice of a hawker, gambler, or swindler who acts as an enthusiastic customer to entice or encourage others.
Do you agree with this definition?
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:34:22
So then by that definition you are saying that anyone shilling either is paid or has a financial gain to be had in misleading whoever they are shilling. Do you truly believe anyone that mentions any alt coin fits that criteria?

The censorship of bitcoin has screwed them in the long run. Anyone from the outside looking in is immediately driven away. The technology couldn't keep up during the ath and the period of the most exposure it has ever had. Regular people that were getting in now won't. They have flocked to other coins and it will be extremely difficult for bitcoin to earn back the trust of layman

How can I filter my front page to block articles like this? It may not be every day, but damn near every single day for the past 6 months you see this same shit. How about we just start posting an article when there is evidence they intend to ban it

In his defense people have to make alts to get around bans from the constant purging of dissent in this sub
@_date: 2018-04-19 16:00:25
Interesting you say that, because the alt coin subs are not like that. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 18:42:11
I guess time will tell huh
@_date: 2018-04-19 14:55:55
Its not promotion of alt coins that's the issue. You literally cant even mention any of them. You can't discuss issues with bitcoin or ways they can be addressed. You can't point out this coin is doing this to fix those issues or that coin is doing that. Bitcoin is the greatest (its not) and if you have anything to say otherwise then you are out of here. You can all say why would you let a subreddit determine what coins you hold. You need to be asking that to the countless people that have sold all their bitcoin after being banned from this sub

Censoring comments. The reason I havent and won't likely ever invest in bitcoin. If your product is the best you don't need to silence your community
@_date: 2018-04-19 16:14:37
Ask that to the countless people that have been banned from this sub and sold all their bitcoin for alts afterwards
@_date: 2018-04-19 20:00:32
If only people posted screencaps of the comments that got them banned from here in the alt subs, then there would be clear evidence of such things
