Yes, you are correct. I made a calculation error. but it is still a lot higher than the normal interest rate. The annualized rate is (1+0.2%)^365 = 207.36%. I will update my op.

The Chinese name of Leon Li is 李林。I could not find his name in the elite princelings network. I don't think he could be a son of an important official or princelings(太子党). you foreigners probably do not understand how rich those prince-lings clique people are. It is very unlikely they would be interested in these small peanuts. 
Check the reports on Bloomberg and nytimes about truly influential Chinese families (we are talking billions):

I checked the details. the loan is issued based on the total asset of a certain account. For example, if you have 10 bitcoins, they could offer 20*5010 rmb loan given the price of bitcoin is 5010.

this is the original regulation which governs that lending interest rate should not be more than 4 times of the base interest rate set by the bank.

Hi prof7bit,
I could not find the original document. but that is a fact. the xinhua agency has a report on this. 
all 3rd party money service company like tenpay, alipay has stopped providing services for bitcoin platforms. 
either, i don't think finding the original regulation is important to verify the news. In China, many things are determined by orders from the above. some are in paper form, some are in verbal/oral form. According to the news report, it is more like an oral form from the people's bank of China - china's central bank. (央行近期已约谈了银行、支付宝、财付通等相关负责人，明确要求银行、支付机构不能给比特币交易网站提供支付与清算服务。) 
a news report from one govt site says so.
