So if this incentive exists explain how I would go about "sueing" these people? Correct me if Im wrong but your suggestion does not really seem feasible.

Good insight. From what Ive read circle is one of the companies trying to solve this issue and make bitcoin able to compete with paypal etc.

The link is mentioned in the post for that reason. However the aim of this post is to start a discussion on a pitfall related to BTC use.

I didnt think of that. Are there any startups working on escrow services? How would merchants be able to protect themselves with these escrow services? Edit: for example if the customer just denies receiving the product

Sounds like a good choice! I think the absolute best place would be if you could place one in Zurich HB. Theres a bunch of new shops and theyre open 7 days a week, and the HB has thousands of people passing through every day. Ill be in touch if I think of anything!
