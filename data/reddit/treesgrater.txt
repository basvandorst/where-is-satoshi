This include bitpay?
@_date: 2019-07-19 12:01:26
Because its constant varying value, lack of real adoption, and long wait times/high transaction fees are non existent right
@_date: 2019-07-19 15:40:28
This subreddit is a joke
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:40:02
If this subreddit would stop circle jerking bitcoin for like five seconds and come to realize that the fees actually are an issue then maybe I would consider listening to anything in this bias ass place

You're not wrong but bitcoin cash is also going to the moon 
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:32:23
Small is such a relative term

No bro they would never! Just create a bounty using bounty0x and you'll get it back in no time /s

But bro we need more news to lambo moon. But in all seriousness I think a large majority of investors in bitcoin or at least those that frequent this subreddit have absolutely no understanding of risk/return

Everyone currently just now getting in the space is doing is exclusively to make money fast. They don't care about becoming your own bank, decentralization, or taking power away from fed. They literally just want to click their mouse wait a bit click their mouse again and convert into more fiat.

Dude please dont ever take this subreddit serious again. It's literally been a joke for almost five years
@_date: 2019-11-27 18:48:09

@_date: 2019-08-02 21:49:54
Worst meme I've ever seen

This is about to be a bart head graph
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:48:00
Do I back up my wallet on coinbase/GDax or just wallets like electrum? Also if i want to purchase coins besides litecoin bitcoin and etherium what should I use? Looking for most safe, up to date, and lowest fees. Thanks

Exactly let's not forget that multiple exchange attacks, idiots not taking their coins offline, constant fud about foreign bans, chinese new year, tether accusations, bitcoin futures, and the mass amount of complete morons buying bitcoin on credit and having to sell for loss. All this mixed with the fact that the government allowed private hedging of bitcoin using the consumers money. *Cough* JP Morgan, the fact that bitcoin is even above $3,000 in my opinion is insane. I'm positive that $7,500 will stabilize and become the new bottom support for this bull run.

Also doesn't take alt coins off exchange
