So if the mean is 10 minutes, then r = 1/10, and using the cumulative distribution function:
P(no block in 10 minutes) = 1-CDF(10) = e^(-r*10) = e^-1.

How does that argument work? We need miners to make the network stable, but if the mining is not directly profitable, most miners will defect - my individual participation doesn't make a big difference for the stability of the network, and it makes me next to no money, so why should I mine?
To put it another way: how is the threat of instability an incentive to mine (as opposed to current monetary incentive)? It seems too indirect. The situation reminds me of tragedy of the commons. 
I'm probably wrong, I'd be grateful if somebody could explain it to me better.

The *time to the next block* follows exponential distribution. The *number of blocks* in a given period of time follows Poisson.

Oh okay, I see you can do it without scaling up to N-&gt;infinity:
(1-P)^(Nt) = ((1-P)^N)^t = e^(N log[1-P] t)
and N*log(1-P) is a (negative) constant in our situation. So your original formula also follows the exponential distribution.
I think I know where you got the 0.5 and 1/16th: you're assuming that the probability of not finding a block in 10 minutes is 0.5, right? It's actually e^(-1) ~= 0.367. The 10 minutes is the mean (expected value), not the median.
edit: of *not* finding a block

Good point. I wonder how hard it would be to legally justify shutting down exchanges. Sooner or later, it would have to be backed by some law - making bitcoin trade illegal?

It can also tell you how much exactly you would pay at a market price.

I hope so! One of the reasons I'm excited about Bitcoin is that there's finally a chance of bringing down Paypal.

The plot thickens!

That is correct. ~~Now assume P=constant/N (difficulty adjustment) and take the (1-P)^(Nt) to the limit~~ (**edit**: see my response below, this is not necessary)
lim (N-&gt;infty) (1-P)^(Nt) = lim (1-c/N)^(Nt) = e^(-ct)
EDIT: the important part is that the target depends on the number of miners. That's how we're able to maintain the 10 minute average.

A comparison I've heard is "shutting down Bitcoin is like shutting down BitTorrent" and we know how well that has worked so far.
And literally **turning off the entire internet** would be throwing out the baby with the bath water, I don't think any western government can afford it if it wants to stay in power.

You're correct. (1-P)^(Nt) is the same thing as e^(-ct), for the right constant c. So 1 - (1 - P)^(Nt) is indeed the CDF. 
This is still an exponential distribution, so the value of CDF at its mean is 1 - e^(-1), regardless of where the mean is.

AFAIK it's not how it works; you can't "add false transactions" because they resulting block would be rejected by legitimate clients. 
What you can do is fork the ~~network~~ blockchain and add a block with alternative transactions involving *your* addresses, allowing you to double-spend your money. My question is: if Deepbit admins tried something like this, how long until the community would notice?
As long as the computing power can be taken away from them at a moment's notice, there is IMO no serious threat. It will be worse once some entity actually *controls* &gt;50% power.
