On 1/10/2014, bitcoin was worth $820. How did you forget about $1,200,000 in your wallet? Lol

Mt.gox takes weeks for you to receive your money.

Yeah, not instant though, the Identity verification is the only thing left for me to get instant. Coinbase support didn't help me either, I want to know where they receive these "public records." I heard of a few sites, but my information doesn't come up on any of them, maybe because I just turned 18 a few months ago. I'm not entirely sure.

Those who sell on black market sites are making huge profits with these price hikes recently.

I'm interested as well, bitmarket might be the best bet

The only thing would be hacks for the users

This is why I don't believe Bitcoin is going to be as widespread as we hope for. I believe the common American is not going to want to perform all of these steps, especially the older folks.

Facebook doesn't like Bitcoins.

I'd like to point out that BTCChina still is over $1000, they were up to $1200
EDIT: Still over $900 :p

This is why bitcoin will never be as widely accepted as we want, the average person isn't going to make paper wallets and all of that extra security.

This is the main reason why I believe Bitcoin isn't going to be as big as we want it to be. The majority of people aren't going to want to install a bunch of software and make paper wallets and such, because it's just too much work.

I've attempted identity verification 23 times. Not once have I seen someone that I supposedly am associated with. And none of the above never gives me credit either. Do you know where they pull their "public records" from? I'm only 18, so I haven't seen my info on any sites like white pages or anything.

I just sold a bunch of old stuff when I moved to college, then as the prices rose and fell, I sold and bought at the right times, allowing me to keep purchasing more.

What does this mean for orders being processed? It should clear tomorrow. :0

I thought eBay doesn't allow Bitcoin sales? And especially in the description, he says to have the payment be a gift.

I'm a freshmen computer engineering college student who's really interested in bitcoin. I have bought some, but haven't done much else yet. I would like to start mining, if possible. I'm getting a raspberry pi very soon.

Only 21 Million bitcoins will exist, so they're can only be new 2.1 million millionaires with that logic. However, there are already nearly 10 million millionaires, with 1 million new millionaires being added in the last 4 years. Therefore, I believe it wouldn't cause much strain.

I've been having a similar issue, I've never received a name that I am associated with.
