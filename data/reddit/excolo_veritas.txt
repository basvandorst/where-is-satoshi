... I'd think it obvious? Picture the coin symbols as a graph. Bitcoin has been bouncing up and down a lot lately. I think 3 days ago I got an alert on my phone "Yay, bitcoin is up 5% in the last hour!" ***literally*** 2 minutes later "Bitcoin is down 5% in the last hour!". I personally think it's going to continue to go up, but, it certainly has been bouncing a bit. A better phrase might be "rocky/uneven conditions" or something like that, but I think they used "slippery" as in "slip" as in gains keep slipping

This happened to me with my bank until I had a pissed off conversation with a bank rep via their secure messaging (email essentially). I was pretty much like "so let me get this straight, you're going to tell me what I can spend my money on? And that even though it's 100% legal, I'm doing nothing wrong, you're blocking my actual transactions for 'safety'? Even though I don't want you to do this. Maybe I should find another bank without this 'safety'". Yeah, none of my coinbase transactions are blocked anymore

You mean the kind of stuff that gets posted to this sub all the time? Say it isn't so

I'll probably get downvoted to hell for this, but bear with me on this point. I hate articles like this, sure, it's great to try and talk the guy off the ledge, and renew some hope, but at the same time do you think anyone in the Roman empire was going "we've lost plenty of wars and battles but always triumph! We'll be fine!" before the end? I'm willing to bet someone was. Market history can be a good analysis for trends, and give some hope, but by no means any kind of guarantee. The truth is, no one knows for certain if the bear market will continue, or turn starting in an hour. Sure there can be strong indicators, but, my point stands. Especially in regards to bitcoin because there hasn't been anything like it before. With stocks, we have a much longer history to try and analyze, it's tied to people you can hold responsible (rightly or wrongly). With bitcoin, we have 9 years of history which in the grand scheme isn't much. Nothing is likely until it happens. "There has never been a bear run longer than 12 months" until there is, "after every bear run the bull run comes back to twice the previous peak" until it doesnt (making up these examples for the sake of argument). I believe bitcoin will succeed because of what it is, but if you constantly view an article like this as a circlejerking pep-talk you're gonna have a bad time overall.

Wasn't it posted yesterday that it was a setup to a joke? There was a picture of the billboard saying "Bitcoin hits new high" immediately followed by "Bitcoin hits new low". Still think it's cool that they made the joke, and actually think it's kinda funny, just pointing it out

Lmao I'm a millennial
Edit: also I work in IT as a programmer, so don't try and say I "don't get technology" either

This is fucking stupid. They can legally require you to disclose w/e they want financially with reason and court orders. Yeah, they can't physically take it, but neither could they if you had gold in an undisclosed location you didn't tell anyone about. If you don't comply they will arrest you, garnish wages, fine you, w/e they have at their disposal
Is saving a few thousand worth having to move to a non-extradition country... Where you'll likely still have to pay taxes to them or get arrested?

I have a friend who is a huge environmentalist. She went on a tirade about how bad crypto was because it used so much electricity. Until you compare it to the amount of energy we use mining for gold, or printing money (I think printing money was less, but not a huge amount), or how much electricity banks use, or credit card companies. It uses a ton of electricity, but no more (and in many cases less) than other currencies.

Honestly, no one knows. The closest thing you can compare it to, and people often do, is stock. While there are similarities, Bitcoin is certainly not a stock. It also doesn't have enough of a history to use that as a good guideline. It's not a useless guideline, but, it doesn't have say a 100 year history where things may more closely match the current situation in the past. All that really matters, in terms of an investment (rather than spending it like currency) is do you feel it's under valued currently? I think it is. So rise or fall, I feel it will eventually go considerably higher. HODL

If it were real the I in coin would have to be there, so clearly fake

That was a wild ride, was watching about every minute and was like "YES YES YES YES YES YES YES!! No... wait... what... no... no NO NO NO NO NO NO!!!!!"

I bought in around $14,000 a coin. I didn't buy much, few hundred dollars. At this point i'm pretty much in it. Either I go to 0, or it goes up, if I've lost this much of my investment already I don't care enough to "limit my losses". I will fully admit I bought out of FOMO and heavy interest in the technology. My interest hasn't gone down so fuck it, to the moon or bust

I predict that BTC will jump to $100,000 USD tomorrow! See, I can do it too!
People have been making predictions about pricing of things since the beginning of time. If they're wrong, no one remembers, if they're right it's like some prophesy "See guys, I said the stock market was going to tank, and it did!"

1. Isn't that just done by not reddit itself?
2. Going to it is a rickroll video. Not sure if you knew that posting it here, but if you did, the joke is pretty much lost considering you can't follow the link
