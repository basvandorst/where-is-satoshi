Right. And the main story here is that your extremely successful transaction was executed by at least one technically proficient person. You had an ideal outcome initiated by an ideal user.
Unfortunately, even my smart non-technical friends still cannot "decode" bitcoin that easily. It just feels bizarre or complex to them.
My point is that you're saying every negative story has a positive. You used yourself as the positive. I don't see how "a technically proficient user enacting an ideal transaction" qualifies in any way as a "positive". Because it doesn't
Ideal is: low-ability user with second-tier tools (wallet, connection) pays with no problems.

Agreed. Would you take a business seriously if one of their reps suddenly started joking about what a pussy you are?
It's way out of tune. There's a time and a place. Seems like a red flag to me.
I'm always disappointed when on Reddit I see users with such low expectations.

This right here is the zenith of specious reasoning.

But if it's random it's fair. It's not like they're targeting YOU.

You're not helping someone who is "about to purchase [their] first bitcoins." You're answering someone who understand secure offline storage.
And this is the problem with Bitcoin, folks.

Some better than other, however. Food/water are going to be the first things of value. Then people will trade things of increasingly less central need. Precious metals would make their way back well before dollars, and dollars well before Bitcoin. Bitcoin really is a long distance off from reclaiming its value in some kind of disaster scenario.

Markets are irrational and don't care about your reasoning or emotions (or semantics).

Thanks, I didn't see anything on the main Wikipedia donation page. Can you find something for the larger organization? I haven't been able to.

Why are you even conversing with this imbecile?

Why don't you include the actual clickthrough instructions in this kind of post to help people rapidly fix a potential problem? This kind of thing boggles my mind.
    (log in)
    click the Account Settings link in left hand nav
    click the Integrations link, which is the rightmost link in the page content header nav
    look on the page for *API Key Access** (check status, either disabled or enabled).

The spread "right now" is not "every time [you] look", unless you look one time.
Nevertheless, that was NOT the spread during the recent jump. The spread last Friday, when I wrote my post *ON* spreads was a sell $999 (+/- 10 or so) and a buy of 1100, (+/- 30 or so).
So, there are a number of possible explanations.
1. We're talking about different things. The buy/sell spread I am referring to is the traditional one on the sell side, here:
    The sell is the price an account owner can convert their BTC to USD.
    The buy is the price an account owner cant buy BTC at.
    The difference between the two is the spread.
2. There is much higher variance in the spread during big, fast price increases (as in the end of last week, when I started making the observation regarding the spread).  The variance might be temporary, or it might not be.
3. We are looking at different things.
4. Coinbase is showing different spreads to different users.
I'm looking at the spread right now, which is low. I'm betting  is the one most worth following up on.
Lastly, the fact that I'm sitting at 0 points (when I'm the one actually thinking critically here) and your post (which is specious reasoning at best) shows you the current state of bitcoin user savvy.

Me too. It clearly isn't either of you.

Worth and valuation are different from each other.

This means absolutely nothing, but even less than that for money so young.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:38:33
It's not ridiculous. All this commentary about it being ridiculous is ridiculous. Bitcoin's in a huge spike. If it fell just as hard, 10BTC would be a very reasonable amount.

Proofread? One word,  honcho. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:12:43
Ah, I knew there had to be one. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-05 17:23:19
Will it include Electrum, or is it just a general one?
Please do this. Thank you.

So a fast clock, while incorrect and useless, is best of all.

This is one of the dumbest posts I've ever seen on Reddit.

Why doesn't Wikipedia accept bitcoin donations?
