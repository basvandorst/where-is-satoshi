Well, I don't care they made this mistake. I bought btc and wanted to convert it as soon as I received it in TUSD cuz buying at 8K and keep it wasn't the smartest thing. But because they send a 1,8 dollar fee on a transaction of 5K dollars? my btc got stuck and I lost already in value before I received it. I have checked their BTC adres and there is 30million USD of BTC on their adres. to be honest.. of course I want to keep my 0.66 of free BTC. But, can they sue me if I don't?

normally it takes less than an hour ordering with them. I bought with the intention to convert it in tether as soon as I received the money. of course I knew it was about to drop. but I didn't expect it to last for 2 days in the mempool. I called them to fix the problem and they told me they are going to fix it. after a while I called again and they told me that they were having some issues. then he called me back and told me that they sent the amount again which I really didn't understand because that it just giving me twice the amount. he even told me that they discussed it with the head of the office. what do you want me to do? :p that's just an amateurish and unthoughtful decision ipo. they never said anything about refunding an amount.
when they did the 2nd deposit, it was unconfirmed as well and I called them to check it out and to contact the people who are in charge for that. when they checked the unconfirmed TX for the 2nd time no doubt you can over look that double deposit. I think thats just the price they pay when you hire unskilled people for a job like this

if they sent a higher fee it wouldn't get stuck in the blockchain for 2 days right?
