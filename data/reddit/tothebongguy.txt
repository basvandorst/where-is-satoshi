You act like bitcoin should reach a new all time high every day and then you claim you're right when it doesn't.
I don't understand how you can say "bitcoin will crash to $250" and then claim you are right when it dipped to 500 and rebounded to 900.  YOU WERE WRONG!
In essence you could claim you are right as long as bitcoin doesn't hit a new all time high every day. Your logic is moronic.

You couldn't achieve a 51% attack by spending 9k a day to get miners to collude. I think what you are not realizing is that miners would not stay in a pool that was acting maliciously for something like a 2% advantage, and really not for any incentive that would be cheaper to the malicious actor than just building a mine. Miners don't want to destroy bitcoin. Some cash out daily, most hold as much as they can. Miners stand to lose more than what they can earn on a daily basis if bitcoin is destroyed. They stand to lose all of their coin mined/held to date, along with future opportunity. They stand to lose all invested in equipment and facilities. 
  So assume a pool gained 51%, performed a double spend, and created a fork in the blockchain. That is not the end of bitcoin, it just means that all miners have to choose which side of the fork to go to. This is the main difference between one entity owning 51% vs a pool. Miners would leave the pool that was acting maliciously and continue mining on the correct chain. A double spend makes the news, price drops on fear, but miners leave the pool and that's the end of it. Now if an individual had 51% of the hash power, they could constantly fork the blockchain, and they would have enough power to compete with all of the "good miners". They could cycle this action over and over again, disrupting any attempts of the "good miners" to continue. If the bad actor forces a fork and everybody switches off of his chain, he can go and fork the chain that they switched to with no additional costs, and do it again the next time. That is really the only way you could use hash power to kill bitcoin. Even if you were able to fool people into believing they were more profitable by joining your pool, and that you were a good actor, they would leave at the first attempt of a double spend. I think incentivizing people specifically to destroy bitcoin (and remain dedicated beyond one double spend attempt) would be more expensive than building your own super mine.

It's fine to use your paper wallet as a savings account, sending BTC to your public address. The important thing to remember with paper wallets is to always sweep the full balance to your next wallet when you import your private key.

It is an added level of security, like an extra password. You can set it up with SMS message or the google authenticator ap. It will generate a code that you have to enter to log in to your wallet, so only the person holding your phone is able to access your wallet. 
If you use the blockchain.info wallet, the backup is the long string of words in text (automatically generated when you sign up, write it down and hide it) called the seed. That can recover your wallet if you forget password or id.

I agree with your economic points, but we are debating different concepts. Economics is about community in the sense that you described it, not in the sense that OP describes it. Social activity is not "all positive" or "all negative", it is simply interactive trade. 
I am not anti dogecoin. I think that it has a different application than BTC. I also think that your point about transactions per day illustrates this application. To me these transactions occur because dogecoin is not taken seriously as a store of value or a means of exchange. While I agree that transactions per day is one sign of a healthy emergent economy, it is not the only factor. How many of those transactions were an exchange for goods or services?

You can find a lot of info just browsing the subreddit and following it for a while. It takes a bit of time for most people to wrap their heads around bitcoin. Paper wallets are the best option for storage, your coins are safe offline as long as you don't lose your private key. For an online wallet check out blockchain.info.  Remember to always enable 2 factor authentication when you are keeping coins in an online wallet.

Alright, we've got a rare constructive dialogue right here on reddit! 
  So we see today that at a price around 500, it is profitable for the network to sustain over 24 petahash of power. You have to imagine over time, that hash power will become more efficient and cheaper to acquire, so even if today's rate was a profitability cap, there would still exist competing hardware companies trying to gain electricity efficiency and drive that profitability higher. Additionally, we know that the exponential growth curve for the value of btc and the hash power of the network may or may not continue, and they are quite correlated. As long as btc price IS on the rise, the hash power of the network will be as well. Now, suppose we stagnate right here at 500. If the price remains, miners will be feverishly competitive until the only profitable way to mine, is to have the most efficient chip, in the cheapest energy climate. So say that maxes out as well and we have 24 petahash move to Iceland. Now there is a climate where miners will unplug as their meager profitability doesn't suit them, and the hash rate is driven down a bit, but not much unless the price drops, because they are still making money. So at today's state, it would be tough and expensive to implement a 51% attack. And there are no incentives to gain from this, it has to be a rich mission to stop bitcoin. Miners will not collude with eachother to ruin their own profitability by empowering a 51% attack and joining a bad actor's pool. 
  Now imagine the future. In 10 years (and maybe even a year or so) if bitcoin is still at a value around $500, it will be considered a failure already, because we are so early in its history here that would signify a negative or 0 adoption rate. That is a bigger threat to bitcoin than a 51% attack. But on the other hand, if adoption continues, the price will be driven up, the hash rate will follow, and the network will grow. The more the network grows, the less feasible and more expensive it becomes to try and commit a 51% attack.
TLDR  Adoption drives the whole cycle, as long as adoption is occurring, the hash rate will not drop significantly. The incentives are correct to motivate all participants within the framework of adoption. It would be tough to commit a 51% attack today, more difficult in the future with growth. And only does it become easier if bitcoin's adoption does not come to fruition, which would already destroy bitcoin. And the incentive of "I want to kill bitcoin" for the weird rich guy who doesn't care about profits would even be gone because bitcoin's implosion would be visibly evident at that stage, there would not be much left to kill.

You're correct. As I mentioned in another response, OP's use of community signifies a coherent friendly group that is fundamentally aligned to one purpose. In an economic sense, community just means all participants in the economy, regardless of their role. I.E. it's not good or bad if there is wall street money involved, or criminal money, or charity money, or tip money, it is all just participation. The more people who participate the more valuable it becomes.

@_date: 2014-08-21 18:49:03
OPs post does a pretty good job of that itself, which is I guess what we are arguing about here. The main problems:
-OP seems to not understand the sheer amount of hash power out there
- just because a pool has 51% of hash power doesn't mean that they have the same amount of control that a single miner would have. Ex. If the pool is attempting a double spend miners likely will leave the pool and diminish its power.
- for an individual to be in control of 5%-10%-20%-30%-40%-60%..this could not be achieved by manipulation or trying to make mining unprofitable....it's not impossible to achieve that level of hash power, but it would take a scenario such as the US. Government creating a super mine, and it would take hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars at this point.
-mining is already competitive and there are a lot of other factors, for example OP mentions cost of electricity. The real result of expensive electricity is that mining will geolocate to areas with cheap electricity, geothermal energy, and zero cooling cost climates. For every person who gets priced out by the local electricity costs, there will be a counterpart who will gain in areas with low costs. Thinks bout it this way: miner in Texas pays 1k a month in electricity and can no longer break even. He unplugs. The difficulty curve adjusts downward. Mines in cheap areas are instantly more profitable because of this adjustment, more miners move to this area and set up shop up until it is not profitable to do so.
Basically there are just a lot of other doomsday scenarios for mining or bitcoin in general that are of much more real concern. OP tends to think that one person can change all of the incentives for mining enough to gain power with their help, when in reality, it would just take immense resources because of the size of the network and it's current growth rate. 
And the reason I say it would have to be US gov or a super rich entity, is because they will have to spend a ton of cash for zero return, with the sole purpose being 'we want to destroy bitcoin by any means necessary'. That would be the only incentive to do it, there are no capitalistic or financial incentives to do anything like this.

@_date: 2014-01-09 18:16:06
Right, so the typical reaction people have when they put money into something they don't understand is fear. In reality, the only basis for this fear is still speculative. So you can react in a fearful way, or you can remain patient to see how things work out. There are a lot of intelligent people in the BTC community. A 51% attack is not a new issue.

It seems you are having a binary battle, where the choice is btc vs. quark. Most altcoins attempt to solve some "problem" built into the bitcoin protocol. So you have this quark rhetoric. Dogecoin rhetoric in the beginning was "how can btc beat us, their community is shit, ours is great". In the big scheme of things, altcoins should be considered a gamble, especially new ones, because the thing btc has that all others lack is a network effect with 5 years of battling skepticism under its belt already. Things *could* happen to derail btc, but things *have to* happen to catapult an altcoin beyond btc at this point.

All of them are for one service primarily, tipping. Whether that is tipping someone for an idea, or a laugh, or a comment, they are all similar services. You don't see people buying food or renting houses with dogecoin. You do see people accumulating dogecoin and then exchanging it for bitcoin, then using bitcoin to buy other goods and services. 
I think we are in agreement, maybe just failing to recognize it. I view dogecoin as having a great value for the specific purpose of tipping. I don't view it as having every day utility at this point.

Bitfinex is pretty good as far as exchanges go and if you are looking for a perfect exchange in the bitcoin world, you won't find one. I also disagree with your post that these orders are forced to sell at the bottom. That could be true on a short timeline but btc moves fast during manias and you are talking about a movement of under 10% here within the larger 50% rise we've seen in the last few months. Moves much faster than any other tradeable markets. If you want to trade it, exchange risk including the possible theft of your coins is yours to take. You are handing your coins over to someone else's control. Sometimes you can make money doing this, but when a situation like today's happens, don't get too pissed just because you improperly assessed the risk.

Could tainted coins become a reality? Possibly. Could a 51% attack occur? Possibly. Would a large online retailer like Amazon, with a great globally competitive business model, shift focus to manipulating BTC by using its power to create a coin tainting system and forcing a 51% attack? Probably not. 
To me it seems like the Author is attempting to create "A perfect storm" for Bitcoin to fail, by compiling existing negative news into a conspiracy.

Bitcoin has some very interesting, practical, and unique uses as a payment platform no matter how it is categorized. We are only beginning to see what entrepreneurs can do with it. To me this is the most fascinating aspect of BTC. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:55:30
The truth is that in any market big money has an advantage, and sure btc will be subject to some level of manipulation. Right now there are a ton of people trying to cash in on btc in the short run, and there is a ton of speculative money in btc....we will see a lot of manipulative tactics from many entities trying to capitalize off of this. If btc is here to stay it will have to overcome the volatility. Currently btc is still a very young market, in its price discovery phase. I expect high volatility for some time.
There is plenty of other intelligent discussion in this thread from other users. Im not attacking libertymark's point in this post. You really have to see his other posts to get a picture of what he is doing. I am simply trying to tell people that he is pushing an agenda and he is trying to create fear by using reddit as a means to his end. He is not in this for intelligent debate.

That may be your opinion. I don't deny anything when it comes to bitcoin. I don't care if people make money or lose money off bitcoin. I do care if it fails or succeeds in the long run because I think it offers a lot of people an alternative to getting screwed by our existing banking system. 
I also don't deny that you were calling for a "$250 btc price" in the middle of the crash, and that we are currently seeing prices around $850, which seems to be a rebound from the crash and for now the upward trend appears intact(and I'm not talking about the upward trend of the last 24 hrs, I'm talking about the upward trend since 2009). But no matter what the price action reflects, your message and agenda remains the same: bitcoins are tanking and everyone should sell. 
You also add an obvious level of manipulation to your own character when you pose as a bitcoin enthusiast who is currently holding and then say things such as "[–]Libertymark -3 points 1 hour ago--
not good...that means people who want to crash bitcoin or manipulate it beyond normal supply/demand...will now have an extra tool
fuck me" or when you submit a new thread titled "Can someone clarify the china news..this means consumer in china can't fund a bitcoin account via their bank right?" 
You are a dishonest asshole trying to manipulate people by posting negative sentiment everywhere even if it is totally unrelated to the flow of commentary.

I'm also still bothered by the rewarding of mediocrity and the punishment of achievement in my high school Spanish class. I could get an A in that class in my sleep, it was not advanced enough for me and I was bored. I would do my homework right before class during the 5 minute passing period I had every day. During all my presentations I used advanced tenses and it was clear I was at a higher level of competence than the rest of the class. My teacher gave me a B. I got 100 on all academic work and presentations. I got a 0 on my class participation which was 10% of the grade. She gave me a 0 class participation and a B in the class because it took me the least amount of effort to reach the highest levels of achievement in the class.  Maybe she should've just bumped me up to the next level. 
I'm also 30 and, like you, Still Pissed!

I hope that you are able to capture some of the frenzy around these events. That is one of the more interesting parts of BTC. Frenzy around price rise, frenzy around news like the silkroad bust. It is a rare purely psychological market at this point in its history.
I am a miner and received some rather expensive hardware the day after the Slikroad bust....I didn't feel like DPR sitting in a cell with my BTC being seized, but my heart was in my throat for a few days. The craziest part was that the negative silk road news was so big from an exposure standpoint that it actually created a lot of positive interest and upward momentum for BTC.

May be a dick move to try and promote any of your own ideals during Christmas, but I took a different approach. I got my family normal gifts, then I gave my parents 1 BTC on a paper wallet that I vac sealed. I told them to put it in the safe and forget about it. But this way they can be on the BTC ride and if at any point in the next 5 years they get interested, they will thank me then for this innovative gift. If not, who cares?

Thanks, that clears it up a bit. I'll checkout blockchain.info. So in pool mining you're saying that both the block reward and the transaction fees are added together and then split between all miners in the pool...and that number would likely be the BTC reward that I am seeing? Or does the pool operator receive the transaction fees?

So what exactly is "the bitcoin killer business"? I read this as JP Morgan trying to become a btc patent troll. You come here and try to create BTC panic and Bearish sentiment. Then you pump quark coin. Don't you realize that for any virtual currency to become mainstream it will need to survive the attacks of all the entities that stand to lose from its success?
If this is a threat to BTC its a threat to all virtual currencies, including your precious quarkcoin. It's also a long ways off, undefined, may not come to fruition. It should not flip short term sentiment. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 16:07:23
The price has been pretty stable above 800 since the "crash" last week, if that's what you're trying to say. No news this week has influenced the market to move much in either direction. Do you even chart bro? The 7 day trend is actually up 1.75% as the price sits around 900 today. That is a pretty flat week, it is a very light up week. BTC price simply has not "been going down for a week on all this so called good news."

Both groups of dudes are subject to their own biases, and both groups have an inability to see news as good, bad, and neutral.

Correct. I assume like any other police auction that these would be auctioned off as a lot, and sell for a fraction of their true value. Of course their liquidity could cause someone to bid high in which case no value would be lost. It still puts them in a strange area if they auctioned the coins.
