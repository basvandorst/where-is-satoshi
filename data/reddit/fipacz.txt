- Use an exchange and that supports Segwit addresses, for example Coinmate.

Most Bitcoins are already owned/paid for by someone.
@_date: 2017-03-16 22:03:42
That's a good point. What do you see as a drop big enough to make them realize this?
@_date: 2017-08-24 09:30:37
Segwit was just activated. We need it to be implemented in wallets.
@_date: 2017-08-13 23:50:07
How long is it gonna take to deal with the full blocks? Do you see it as the main problem at least? 
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:56:23
Don't you see the current situation with full blocks as critical? 
Do you think it is going to be solved by activating Segwit? 
@_date: 2017-08-16 12:38:16
You are right. Paypal was founded in 1998. I don't know how I missed that.
On the other hand it does not mean that Bitcoin is not Elon's take on internet payments take 2.
@_date: 2017-08-16 12:00:40
I have this theory for some time now.
Elon Musk is Satoshi Nakomoto. 
- He is the biggest genius alive.
- He must have had thought hard about online payments.
- Paypal and Bitcoin were both founded in 2009.

Wouldn't spamming 200 MB block be insanly expansive? 
I thought spamming even current 1 MB block is pretty expensive. 
Thanks for taking the time to deal with these questions. 
@_date: 2017-04-21 06:19:55
Yes. They have quite a few projects there. 
3D printing lab, bitcoin meetups,... 
@_date: 2017-04-22 04:41:25
I don't know how exactly, but I know they found an accountant that was willing to do it. 
They are trying to convince theire suppliers to accept bitcoin, so they can pay their bills in bitcoin as well. :) 
There is a new law (6 months now) in Czech Republic saying that you have to register every bill for every customer immediately online through an IRS system. They refused to do so as they see it as a too much surveillance-ish tool.  So the IRS will probably start throwing fines at them and they might go out of business sadly. They are very stubborn...

There is a coffee place in Prague, where you can pay ONLY in bitcoins! :)
 it's called Paralelní polis, if anyone would be interested. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 08:04:08
Exactly, his obligation is to sell the bitcoins for as much as possible. And this is the way to get the most of it.
If he would have chosen another way, for example auction the whole bunch, he would get a lot less USD for it and might himself get into legal problems. Hm? 
@_date: 2017-09-21 02:17:29
Nonsense 
@_date: 2018-03-11 14:06:16
That might be true for some crypto but for sure not for Bitcoin. Many companies or individuals tried to control it and they all failed. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 07:58:54
They are not deflationary. If one company would like to, they can produce a billion more of them. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 09:10:38
It will be canceled if the mining support falls bellow 75 %.
@_date: 2017-10-19 07:14:35
Like without followers, they will not have money for car payments, gas and repairs. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 13:12:26
But even if they mine them, they do not have them for free. They have to pay the loans, electricity, people, rent...
With a discount, yes.
@_date: 2018-07-22 02:55:37
Which will bring the governments to collapse. Don't you see how that could bite us in the back part? 
@_date: 2018-03-11 21:40:30
But it will not inflate Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:41:47
So which phone wallet do you recommend? I want to keep some small amount of btc on the go. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:23:17
I think so, but I can't find such statement now... 
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:21:31
could you elaborate?
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:27:33
There is also a coffee in Prague (Paralelni polis) where you can pay ONLY with BTC. It is very entertaining when some older people come in and the waitress starts explaining them how to get Bitcoins from the ATM. :))
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:56:29
They have to and they do. There is an accounting company that specialises on cryptos.
But they are ignoring the latest regulations about registering every single receipt online. So they might go out of business soon.
@_date: 2017-05-30 08:57:38
The transaction has 13 confirmations, so I guess it is solved now...?
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:16:34
It says 8 confirmatoins. 6 confinrmations are considdered safe.
@_date: 2017-06-06 08:45:44
OK, what are your companies?
@_date: 2017-06-29 07:32:53
He works for Paralelni polis. That's Prague's hackerspace with the only coffee place in the world where you can pay only with bitcoins, no fiat. Very cool place. They have some kind of activity there every day.
