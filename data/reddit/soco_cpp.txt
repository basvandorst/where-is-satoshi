Money orders are pretty anonymous. You can write whatever names you want in there. I don't think they can be reasonably stopped, unless someone ridiculously thought they could stop bank payments to any Mexican location. Checks are around the same. Will US banks stop honoring checks cashed in Mexican banks? Who will do the investigations needed to have any clue that this transaction came from an illegal alien? It is just nonsense. It will never work and is completely infeasible. 
It would effectively become a state trade sanction. Those are fighting words that have started wars in the past.

Trump cant stop money transfers, even in the legacy money system. He could maybe force some expensive and poorly working restrictions on money transfers like Money Grams and WU. There is nothing he can do to stop checks, cash, or money orders from just being mailed through US Mail. Obvious nonsense is obvious, just like the ridiculous wall.

Yet mailing cash is not illegal and some half baked plan to confiscate cash mailed to Mexico would never work. 
It is a half baked plan a grade schooler could come up with that is completely infeasible.
Putting a tax on all money going to Mexico is a stupid move, a trade sanction, which would end business deals with the country, cause a huge rift in relations, and could potentially lead to war.

I mean as far as anyone has said that I've seen, SegWit will require a hardfork to implement......**then** SegWit will allow every change from then out to be done via soft fork. It is understandably confusing.

The emergency Bitcoin hard fork quite awhile ago. The first concept of SegWit required a hardfork, but newer revisions of the concept could roll out SegWit with a softfork.
@_date: 2016-04-06 13:49:13

"This" (ChainAnchor) is apparently just a misunderstanding. 
The naive concept that miners would not trade short term profits for the long term success and prosper of Bitcoin is a commonly held over simplification of the profit dynamics of quickly evaporating mining profit margins and a misguided exertion of trust.

That is true in some sense. Yet, I fear the block reward is meant to be spread out in a way where mining profitability maintains a near zero profitability. Adding anything to a near zero profitability, creates a more significant profit. This profit may lead miners into investing in more hardware. Then when the block size is finally increased, that profit is yanked from under them, they are back to near zero profitability. That will not be an appealing position, even if the miner didn't make poor additional investments.
This makes me think any amount, not just enough to offset the block reward, creates a destabilization in mining incentive.

An exchange may rarely buy Bitcoins of their own and sell them. Normally, they don't. Normally, they just provide a platform for users to sell and buy Bitcoins, none of which are owned by the exchange, only temporarily held by them.

I fail to see your where you think this is a failing chart. If we have Visa's 2015 ts/ps by 2032, we should be ecstatically proud! Even if Visa grows many times more even with us in the mix. That is a hell of a goal to shoot for, really.
I don't see your pessimism of centralization, because I realize I can't foresee technology that far away. I realize I shouldn't push 2015 logic on 2032 technology. Maybe, by then, centralized datacenters won't be the only way to handle securing the blockchain at that magnitude. I think side chains like LN are perfectly reasonable by that point anyways.
I too have long game concerns of centralization when it comes to way down the road with massive worldwide adoption. I foresee a world where every major country has its own mining datacenter and the biggest countries fight to keep from getting too far behind on hashing power. I also realize there is a lot of different ways that could either be a good thing, a tolerable thing, or that this would never happen. I keep feeling Moore's Law held respectably long, but it is about time for a big game change, where computer processing jumps by leaps and bounds with new technology approaches.
While I don't know as much as I'd like about LN (I've got some reading to finish), I am excited about it. It just reminds me that people seem ready to throw away Bitcoin and limit Bitcoin's potential for LN though. I think Bitcoin has much more to accomplish yet!
As you see in the chart, there is a point where LN and other side chain-type 3rd party services/system can really benefit. Right now, there are none that will be ready in time to save Bitcoin from irreversible "fee market" disaster. Will LN be ready and going by mid 2016? While I don't like everything about the BIP101 schedule, it is pretty clear that LN will have its time to shine in 4 years, and by then it should be implemented, tested, and running like butter already. If adoption explodes massively, it may need leaned on earlier. At least Bitcoin, with an increased block size limit, wouldn't be dead in the water with a permanent ATM-fee extortion market imposed by miners, if LN doesn't get done in time, work, or completely mitigate scaling and all Bitcoin problems like a savior.
I'm thinking big blocks alone may solve the problem and it isn't a cop out. I'm thinking big blocks alone will solve the immediate problem that will begin manifesting in months. I don't think Bitcoin was ever designed for arbitrarily and pointlessly small blocks. Bitcoin isn't all it can be now, it is massively restricted. We are trying to push for workarounds to the massive restriction that no longer makes sense. This doesn't mean the work around aren't great and won't still be needed. It means, quite holding Bitcoin down, LN will get its chance.

Why use off-chain or side-chain or LN for micropayments or small transactions...when you can just use an altcoin? Seems some people are focused on shooting Bitcoin in the foot to push these alternative chain businesses and not thinking things through. Once the fee market materializes and Bitcoin transactions get too expensive, you better bet I'd be using an altcoin rather than some convoluted mess of side chains or insecure centralized off chain solution.

This is interesting to contemplate. I would think that the scarcity keeps the value high and that since it makes no change in supply, it shouldn't impact the value directly. Meaning, that the effort, cost, and energy 'shouldn't' be tied to value, but their may be some arguments to the contrary. If they do mine all these chips themselves en-mass, their control of mining rewards could be enough to allow them some impact on supply and thus value, though.

Bitcoins and Bicycles
I believe Bitcoin has obvious intrinsic value. Other transaction providers like checks, have banks charging checking account fees, check printing fees, overdraw fees, and if none of those, they are obtaining a profit from providing that service in some alternate way. Money orders are not free either. Moneygram or another money order company is charging a fee and they are making a profit from providing that service. 
Bitcoin is a service which does not profit. The system charges a minute fee to support the robust security of the service, but no where near a transaction service provider's profit. I propose, by being a transaction service without an owner, which provides its service for nearly free, that as long as more expensive services exist, that Bitcoin intrinsically absorbs that value as a whole with addoption.
Think of it like a free community object. Imagine a poor small rural town, where no one can really afford their very own personal bicycle. Assume that town is donated one bicycle and they decide to share it as a community. The baker uses it to deliver bread to the old folks at the end of town on Mondays. On Tuesdays and Thursdays the grocery peddles down to the farm and picks up a basket of milk bottles for the store. On Friday Billy's little brother rides him on the handle bars out of town to the coal mine and drops him off to work for the weekend. The point is the community shares and makes use of this bicycle and it become something they rely on for their daily routines. To know how great of intrinsic value this bicycle has gained, one only needs to imagine the reaction when it breaks down. The extra costs and trouble the community incurs while this bicycle is not working and the quickness the whole community has to chip in to make sure it gets fixed promptly.
As we can see, Bitcoins or bicycles, as a useful and very much used service that is nearly free and becoming relied upon, intrinsic value increases rapidly with reliance and the continued providing of a service much below market value for that service.

This article has a horrible and flawed point. It spends all this time explaining irrelevant stuff, educating the reader about scarcity, then says the main reason Litecoin will lose value is because of its inferior liquidity, a cause of scarcity. This is of course a self contradicting point.
Many commenters have mentioned arbitrage and hedging as a reason Litecoin and other Altcoins have purpose.
I think competition and innovation also drive Altcoin usefulness. While Litecoin may not seem to have many innovations, it does have an independent community, a good amount of merchant adoption, many investors, and several unique tools and features outside of the wallet application.
We've seen with Dogecoin that community can be innovation in its self. Also experimenting with block rewards, mining algorithms, and mergemining also bring some innovation to the table which may effect scarcity and the coin's value.
New Altcoin innovations pop up every week, with PoS and variants, mining strategy experiments like ASIC resistance, difficulty algorithm innovations, and botnet resisting CPU algorithms. Not to mention the many coins seeking to provide services over their block chains and dark wallet features.
There are many innovations and a lot of competition. There is plenty room for more coins than just Bitcoin to become prominent; Bitcoin just has a huge head start.

I refuse to use sites that force 2FA. I prefer focusing on good unique passwords and hardening password recovery methods instead. Remember that you are creating a metadata trail for your coins. This web of associations can be very revealing. At least we can hope that only the government and the website you are using 2FA on will know these devices you 2FA with, assume the sight uses properly secure HTTPS. With text messages you reveal your cell phone number. Even using other forms of 2FA without revealing your phone number, you reveal your device. Your device typically has serveral accounts associated with it, including your Google account and various email accounts.
When you use 2FA, you create a metadata trail of account associations that go with your cryptocurrency address. The website you use 2FA with others with access to your metadata (governments), can then create a shadow profile of you through these account and device associations and associate your crypto wallet address with it.

Most of the time 2FA is used with your cell phone number for SMS. Obtaining your identity with your cell phone number alone is barely past trivial. Not only is the 2FA protected site aware of your phone number, but entities monitoring web and or phone metadata can correlate the association. There are also serious questions about which government entities can demand a website provide such information even without a warrant. 
Even if you don't use SMS 2FA, several potential leaks of this association to your device is possible, from device fingerprinting, to pinging some authenticator server. Once you've fingerprinted or identified a device, one could potentially correlate that with other metadata to identify the owner.

I think alts really lack the liquidity that Bitcoin has. Obtaining altcoins is kind of difficult unless you buy Bitcoins, then trade for altcoins, witch is hard to justify unless you really have use for that altcoin waiting for you. I think even though altcoins have a lot of market acceptance, riding on Bitcoin's wave or not, the majority of altcoin holders only have funds from non-serious mining or tipping proceeds. They don't have enough altcoins to make real purchases. I see this with Dogecoin a lot. People tip around a few hundred  Doge all day long, but can't scrape up the 55k doge it takes to buy something that costs $10. I think the "pumping alts" concept is just copout thinking, "Meh, I don't know how or why so it must be pump n dump."

"Credit union" probably gives the wrong impression, but the idea is to create a dedicated service to establish and maintain liquidity between crypto and fiat. This "credit union" has only one role, to convert fiat to crypto and crypto to fiat, and all the leg work required to do this. Such as establishing and maintaining partnerships with banking entities, insulating crypto entrepenuers from regulations, and making sure that every bank will accept and allow money transfres to and from their banking partners. 
Otherwise, everyone is bank hopping until they find one that won't freeze/close their account when they find out it has touched crypto, or struggling to maintain business level banking partners to facilitate the fiat side of the crypto business.
I have talked with a dozen banks and credit unions and cannot find one that will allow me to make petty day-trading volumes of money transfers to/from a crypto currency exchange. I have been looking for more than a year.

He seems to be postulating that exchanges are or should be a lending facility. This is obviously incorrect and there is no reason an exchange should ever have less equity on hand than is their customers' accounts represent. Exchanges do not lend money. If the exchange is insecure or stealing money, then it shouldn't be used or trusted with money, as was the eventual case with Mt. Gox, despite hiding and lying about it. Intending to have less than 100% of their customer's equity would benefit no one and have made the problem much worse, and is essentially just what Mt. Gox did when hiding their insolubility, making things much worse.

I appreciate your position, but I prefer to exert higher levels of security adherence instead of forging aspects of my privacy. Fake logins are nothing new and neither is phishing. I choose not to login my credentials without care, instead of linking my personal identity with my crypto financial history. This isn't hard to accomplish when you only login to HTTPS sites, verify the certificate, and double check with a certificate notary. Steps to prevent cookie abuse, XSS attacks, and using only secure devices are also important for maintaining this approach. Most of these extra steps are pretty easy to automate; all green icons, then it is a go.

The easiest way to protect consumers from having their personal info stolen from merchants is to use transactions that don't require giving the merchants personal information of the customers. The only reason banking tools require personal information of customers is because these banking tools are insecure by design and this personal information is used for verification. Bitcoin doesn't have this problem. Bitcoin doesn't need personal information exchanged to make transactions. Regulating the requirement of collecting personal data just forces Bitcoin to have the same glaring weaknesses that banking tools have for no reason.

The end result of ASIC mining is centralization. Given enough time, all mining will eventually be done be one or two huge dedicated industrial sized mining farms, maybe even controlled by a government since they would be the most financially capable. That is not secure for anyone.

LTC went in the game trying to be resistant to GPUs and ASICs. The GPU part didn't last long, but the ASIC part is still holding strong, despite rumors (maybe that will turn without much warning, but looks at least a year off).
I think your assumption that ASICs not being ready for Litecoin yet because of lack of interest and popularity is pretty off. LTC provides a nice challenge to ASIC designers and and extra investment barrier. Lets not forget that just [2 days ago Litecoin had 150% Bitcoin's volume for that day.]( It is easy to blindly say, 'oh their a small junk coin, that is why they don't have ASICs'. It sounds good for the common die-hard egotistical Bitcoin-only enthusiast, but it is not rooted in reality.
I was under the impression that pools have already attempted some underhanded transactions or transaction manipulation. This has definitely happened in smaller AltCoins. I'm led to question your sentiment that pools screwing with transactions is easily correctable. Coins are implementing checkpoint to avoid such things, but then they have to roll back all transactions until the last checkpoint. Transactions get losts. Doing anything better, with the techniques I'm aware of, requires a centralized consensus of where to roll back the block chain to by quite a large amount of interested peoples (ie pools).

[Despite that very public Chinese miner support for 8MB,]( one core dev later purportedly went around asking Chinese miners and comes up with 2MB. An increase to 2MB was in the Bitcoin scaling road map after SegWit.

I disagree. Block rewards are for securing the network. Fees are *only* to discourage spamming and dust. Block reward halving is designed to reduce supply and force the value of Bitcoin up through scheduled scarcity, so that the value of Bitcoin is high enough for these crumbs of fees to eventually be significant enough to replace the block reward in 20 years. If we force fees to be significant to miners now, we are defeating the genius 20 year plan.

It would be quite ridiculous to think the artificial block space scarcity won't break the ingenious miner reward system (block rewards). How bad it breaks it, depends on how bad we let the artificial scarcity get. Miners stand to make inflated short term profits from the artificial scarcity. Allowing them to do so would be like greatly raising the mining "minimum wage" for a year, then setting the minimum wage back. Yanking that inflated revenue out from underneath miners will likely drive many miners away.

Well, he's not wrong.


While there is no realistic indications Bitcoin is 'broke down', our [average block size is happily hovering under 70% full.] ( That is pretty far from immediately concerning, yet our growth makes the Core Dev's "roadmap" seem way too little too late. We can probably expect blocks to fill by the time Core Dev even starts on actually upping the block size limit, which may take an additional year or two to roll out, despite any pie-in-the-sky SegWit or LN vaporware promises. SegWit will take at least a year to roll out as well. 
Yet, judging anything based on what some lame stream NYT sky-is-falling article says is pretty dumb.

@_date: 2016-03-07 19:51:52
Logic. When one needs to outbid others for their transaction to go through, the fee market that gets created by letting blocks fill up, the usable fee price of a transaction will increase proportionally with the transaction rate.
The current "roadmap" plans to not do anything for another year at least. Then what they do will take a year to roll out. At the current rate of transaction growth, we will likely be about 2.5 times capacity for transactions. What fee would you expect it to take to make your transaction go through once we get to such an excess of capacity?

Several altcoins seem to be competing quite well. Bitcoin does obviously have a few years running start on them though. This gives Bitcoin the obvious advantage of more established market adoption and liquidity.
Litecoin and a tiny few other altcoins are the only coin that has had any reasonable amount of time to get established. Just because they are stagnant, doesn't mean when other coins actually have a couple years to establish them-self, they won't become a real force to compete.
This seems like declaring Bitcoin the winner before it has any competition ready to compete.

By the time Lightning Network or SegWit are rolled out we will already be pushing 2.5 to 3 MB transactions per 1MB block and be a massive disaster of jacked up fees to auction off the chance to make a transaction.

Our competition fears us giving free transactions. Maybe we should re-introduce that early feature back into Bitcoin.

All miners collectively getting $430 in block rewards doesn't change (much with value fluctuation). Comparing this to difficulty is not the correct way to think about this. The difficulty purposely keeps each individual's mining profitability minimal. We should not focus on each individual's mining profitability, but only of all miners collectively, who are well taken care of by the existing system.

I don't see how you are saying my math is off. I gave no real math. You gave no math of mine that was off. This was just a vague ad hominid poke at my credibility that you referenced multiple times.


This makes no sense. Fees are not meant to supplement miners for another 20 years. That is what block rewards are for. If you are trying to supplement miner with fees now, then you are breaking a genius 20 year plan.


No, not at all. I'm saying that when we have 2.5 MB of transactions per 10 minutes, that the fight to get your transaction in a block with be a dog-eat-dog drag out.


Just look at the average block size growth for the last year. Project your own estimation in the 2 years or more before the "road map" plans to have anything done and in place. I put us at making about 2.5 MB transactions per block by then.

Until the block reward diminishes, fees are NOT meant to reward miners. That is not a sharp bait and switch, it is a gradual scheduled halving. If we force fees up now, 20 years before they are need to reward miners, then we break the reward system long term. It is a disaster situation even touching a fee market momentarily, will force Bitcoin into a choice between massive loss of miners by yanking the fee market from them after establishing it or maintaining a fee extortion system that spirals out of control as miner greed takes over the entire system, breaking mining rewards long term.

@_date: 2016-03-09 20:54:54
Classic and Core, both sides' solutions are bad! Core does nothing until it is too late and then does too little. Classic puts it in the miners' hands which is a competitive industry that will abuse this.  Both are stupid approaches. Miners should be in an advisory, but not a decision making, position in this. Miners are motivated by mining profit, which is not consistent with the needs of Bitcoin.
We should increase the block size cap immediately, as it is already a little too late. We should probably go with 2.5MB, since we are already too late at going to 2MB. Then we can argue about it all we want for another year or so.
Your proposed option seems very risky and reduces decentralization and creates a small attack surface for killing all of Bitcoin.

This! Also it should be further pointed out that Bitcoin development is not to serve miners! 
Miners get paid for their work. While we should hear their concerns, we are not here to enrich them. The difficulty adjustments make sure that miners are rewarded fairly from block rewards. We don't need to concern ourselves with if miners are "making it by". Fees are not meant to reward miners, they are meant to discourage spam, dust, and empty blocks. Only in 20 years should we concern our selves with how many fees miners get, less we break the ingenious 20 year plan.

Giving miners a reward is what the block rewards are for. The fees are supposed to be just a crumb to discourage transaction flooding and dust. Yet the halvening of the block reward is designed to push the value of Bitcoin up slowly over the next 20 years so that the fees are enough alone to reward miners when the block rewards end.

Once we allow a fee market, we have already and mostly permanently, failed to scale. 2017 is too little too late. SegWit will come too late, and be too little of an impact. A fee market was never part of the miner reward strategy; in fact, it breaks the careful and ingenious 20 year mining reward strategy.

The roadmap says make no changes for a year while working on pie-in-the-sky stuffs. The change will take a year to roll out.

It is the same client with some extra commits. When accepted, Bitcoin core would merge those commits into their github tree and core developers would continue to work from their.

No want wants to hear it, but... The scaling decisions have constituted a change in design that requires immediately starting to develop a fee-market to sustain miners long term. While eventually fees would always sustain miners, enough transactions can't fit in a block to sustain miners without the fees increasing for everyone over time. It's been awhile since I did the math, but miners get a block reward now, which translates to about $6.50 per transaction in a 1MB block, when block rewards run out. If we can fit twice as many transactions per block, each transaction would need to pay half as much fees per transaction. Bitcoin was not designed with a cap on transactions per block or a block size limit in mind. The block size limit was added as a temporary emergency measure long ago. We are in uncharted design territory making things up as we go and this has an impact on transaction fees, confirmation times, and what it makes sense and doesn't make sense for Bitcoin to be used for down the road (ie commodity versus currency).

Yes and I am insinuating the 20MB came BEFORE Gavin. It predates his testing. He got the 20MB from previous talk of capable blocksize capability theories.


Before that, the super well known proposition of a 8MB "compromise" was publicized by Chinese miners. This article misleadingly pretends that never happened.
Later Jonathan Toomim went and did some sort of questionable door to door hand count finding the 2MB answer they wanted from the beginning.

This is why the "roadmap" is just a ridiculous stalling tactic and is *way* too little and *way* too late even if SegWit works out in the real world. Foot dragging to enrich miners with short term gains from a competitive fee market that breaks Bitcoin's mining reward system.
@_date: 2016-03-03 19:44:34
A high difficulty just means the mining industry is flooded and should be ignored regarding this. The price of mining should be ignored too, as we could all go back to CPU mining with devices we already have instead of investing in ever expensive ASICs to compete with the other miners in the flooded market.

Yes, the activation threshold is coded, and many test units are coded . I don't know if it is 'done', but there is definitely a ton of code thrown down and it should be pretty easy. They need only take the thoroughly tested BIP101 activation threshold code and change the block size limit schedule. Seems pretty easy when you realize it is just piecing together already done and tested code then doing some extra testing.

The amount of inflation will halve. This increases scarcity and along with lost coins, reduces supply.

@_date: 2016-03-03 19:46:42
I disagree. As the block reward halves, the scarcity of Bitcoins increases. This should double the value, with all other support and trust in Bitcoin being the same. Fees were never meant to be anything but a crumb, until the 20 year plan to force the value of Bitcoin up by increasing scarcity is finished.
@_date: 2016-01-20 20:13:21
It was an emergency number. Now it has become a magic number only because we are approaching it. An almost full block limit is very profitable for miners. The mining industry shit on its self because of pure greed, and people in the loop are pushing to sustain the pile of shit, by shitting on users, because miners are required to secure our network.
All too smart people fall for the dumb idea that they must make mining more profitable to keep more miners and thus keep Bitcoin decentralized with strong security.
They forget that this is what the sliding mining difficulty is for. They forget that the Bitcoin system rewards miners with Bitcoins in a way that is totally decoupled with the value, therefore trying to maintain miner profitability is nonsense fallacy.
When you implement careful self regulating systems, then things start looking sketchy, people second guess they system, freak out, try override the system, and then screw everything up.
The freaking out is trying to allow the block size limit to be nearly full to force mining to be more profitable, which of course breaks everything.
@_date: 2016-01-26 15:20:29
Maybe he says that because blocks are only about 60% full. Yet it is pretty well understood that any fix would take around a year to roll out, so saying the blocks are filling up seems reasonable to me.

Wow, this is pretty calmly explaining that the ship is on fire!
He's not talking about on-chain verses lightening network. He's talking Bitcoin on-chain verses everything else. He says that high fees are making Bitcoin less appealing and will force miners to compete to keep users on-chain, especially "if" trust-less off-chain solutions like lightening network "materialize". He's saying the fees are getting so high that increasingly only large business-to-business transactions are making sense.
He hints that the block size limit was not expected to be left in place and is forcing Bitcoin to cannibalize its self, forcing innovations of alternatives to Bitcoin, such as trust-less (or semi-trust-less) off-chain solutions. He only denies that alt-coins will fill this role because of their lack of liquidity and lessened security, so maybe that will change if liquidity improves for some alt-coins.
He talks about how this will kill incentives for miners long term, thanks to insufficient throughput to compete, saying a 100 times increase of throughput is needed to be viable as digital gold, rather on a day to day currency. This makes the miner self-cannibalizing SegWit scaling increase a bit of nothing. Since we aren't going to be able to reasonably do 100MB blocks, scaling just isn't going to work out with either of these basic approaches.
His summary really ties it together. He says that lightening network will kill Bitcoin mining as we know it and increasing block sizes aren't going to work. Both sides are wrong and one or both may cause a scene, but in the end, what is "good for Bitcoin" doesn't matter, only market forces do. Silly people seem to bet too hard on those being one and the same, but fail to see that the market has many points of view. He pretty much says Bitcoin will be fixed with a variety scaling solutions and may have to nearly fail and be rebuilt to accomplish that.

Bitcoin is about all of the above. Massive fees are a form of censorship! 
Purposely creating a fee market is really dumb and eludes to trying to mask bigger more serious problems; is the future of PoW mining secretly questioned by devs? Is this fee market a "bailout" to miners? Something fishy is up, use your head!

@_date: 2016-03-03 15:09:24
It depends on how you look at it. I think Satoshi's brilliant design is being bastardized for short term mining profits with this fee market nonsense.
You could expect the block reward halvening to increase scarcity and thus increase the value, so that the value is high enough for a the same small amount of fees to be worth enough to make mining worth while when the block rewards reach zero.
In this point of view, we aren't slowly trading block rewards for fees. We aren't intentionally creating (slowly or otherwise) a disastrous fee market. We are adjusting the scarcity with the intentions of half the amount of coins rewarded by the block reward, being eventually equal in value.
In this view, we ARE suddenly making block rewards disappear, but not before slowly pushing the value of Bitcoin up by manipulating scarcity.

@_date: 2017-03-08 17:28:17
As block rewards go down, fees for transactions in a block will go up, there is no getting around that (except by dangerous loss of hashrate). The only way miners can possibly compete is to be able to pack many transactions in a block, to spread the same amount of fees among more transactions, as they will need the same amount of fees for each block to sustain themselves, regardless of how many transactions fit in a block.

It may provide some slight scaling, as a side effect, and allow lots of scaling options waaaay down the road; awesome! Yet, it wasn't the immediate scaling we needed a year ago and still right now.

Would you consider the same if it was the US with 51%? My answer is initially, "No" and "no based on principle", but would consider a lot on circumstances. Shutting off traffic to Chinese miners isn't a huge risk to Bitcoin, but if the Chinese goverment were to start manipulating their citizens mining operations, my opinion might be different. Yet, the US and UK, with their dirty fascist-security-state ways are just as concerning, if not more. If that 51% was held wholly in these countries, I would find that just as concerning.
It would be appealing if the hashing power was better distributed, yet the capitalistic scourge of the ASIC industry proved that PoW can only be kept decentralized with heavy community influence. The Bitcoin community could easily make a mining call to arms and defeat that 1 or 2% lead China has, if need be.
It is a concern, but a very small one, that isn't an immediate problem.

Sure, LN could enable more market, but the author didn't present any reason why miners would benefit from these off chain transactions at all. The author seems to think that since the LN node is collecting many "amortized" fees, that it for some reason would want to pass on higher than average fees to its on-chain transactions for no reason. Charity? 
Why would a higher than normal fee be needed to ensure a transaction is settled in a certain time frame? If they did have tight time frames to settle transactions for security reasons, what happens if miners can't keep up with demands and transactions take a long time? Would the fee extortion market ramp up? This sounds like a scary situation of possible passive blackmail of LN nodes by miners. 
Lots to contemplate, but the author failed to make a positive note that shows LN is healthy for miners, other than possibly making them the effective strong armed mobsters of LN nodes.

You seem to be expecting fees to increase to sustain mining, instead of the Bitcoin value increasing thanks to the diminishing block reward's impact on scarcity of supply. That is not how it is supposed to work and defeats the purpose of the block reward schedule decreasing over time.

It looks like the [average block size]( is staying around 85% capacity to me, but knocking on 90%'s door.
@_date: 2017-01-20 23:01:38
I looked into the same thing, although I did it a little bit different order. 
My source for [transactions per block]( was much lower, 1728/block right now. I figured 12.5 BTC block reward x $900 = $11,250 per block to sustain miners currently, divided by 1728 transactions per block makes an average of $6.51 in fees per transaction. This happens regardless if the value of Bitcoin increases through scarcity or the fees accepted to get in a block increase.
That isn't going to fly for buying a cup of coffee, nor even any real life transaction. If something doesn't change, off chain solutions are the only way to go it seems.
Yet, I was pondering what changes might keep on-chain Bitcoins useful for every day purchases. The possibilities that came to mind, not as solutions, but as impacting factors were:
 * Much increased hashing power per electricity.
 * Much increased network bandwidth.
 * Much increased Bitcoin value through increased scarcity, $10K/BTC, $20K/BTC, or more
 * Larger amount of transactions per block, be it bigger blocks or some other way that wasn't off-chain movement.
 * Possible changes to PoW, such as faster blocks, PoS, or something new.
No real conclusion though, but lots to ponder.

I have to say I disagree with at least some of that interpretation of the whitepaper. I find the decreasing block reward schedule to have a dual purpose at minimum. Firstly to create gradually increasing scarcity, for the purpose of increasing the token's value. Additionally, instead of gradually replacing the shrinking block rewards with increasing fees, I interpreted an intention to wing miners off of the extra supplemental incentive of block rewards as the the token gradually matures in value, making generally the same amount of fees worth more.

Yeah, but that is scheduled for approaching 100 years from now. Artificially inflating that fee now, is obviously bad news, as everyone has been saying for many months. Even worse, allowing an artificially inflated fee market now, may make fixing that miner abuse of the system later a dangerous thing, by yanking mining profits from under miners causing many to drop out and the hashrate to plunge.....as people have been saying for a long time. The key was to not allow an artificially inflated fee market to form in the first place.

I've read and fully understand the link I provided. 
Just because the block reward will be under a single Bitcoin, doesn't mean that is necessarily going to be insignificant. The whole point of the halving is to slowly increase scarcity. It is a huge flawed assumption to expect the value to be that low in 2034 or for the current transaction fees not to be insanely high if not lowered immensely. If so, we'd have some huge problems. The value of 1 BTC then may be mostly equivalent to the 12.5 BTC block reward today in value.

Kind of a bogus argument with a hint of desperation. Using LN as if it is a scaling method of Bitcoin. So someone mentioned LN long ago, that has no bearing more recent issues.The point of "encourage scaling for many years" is not proven, but was it every really questioned in the first place? No one questioned that anyone involved didn't want to scale. The question has always been how and how fast. People were upset that a long term plan of years was chosen instead of a faster plan. People were upset that a competitive fee market was allowed to become established, because scaling wasn't done fast enough.

@_date: 2016-11-29 14:49:51
I'm starting to believe the conflict isn't over how to scale, but the when we scale. More specifically, to scale before or after we allow a fee market to develop. Sure a fee market always existed, but it had no real pressure, until we let blocks fill up recently in this massive and arguably risky experiment. Core's plan was to wait forever to scale and that seems to be the main stress factor for many. SegWit takes forever to get developed, tested, activated, and actually start helping the block size. I get it, half of that is done, but it wasn't yet when people wanted an immediate fix. Other fixes on the road map for scaling are super far off and questionable. People weren't pushing for large blocks so hard because they thought it would work better than SegWit, they were pushing for large blocks because it could be done quickly, before fee market pressure started. Once profit driven miners get a taste of that pressured fee market, it will be hard to let go. If the pressure has raised the fee too much, when the scaling issue is fixed, the fees will fall and cut the legs out from underneath the profit driven miners. We may lose hash rate. Fees were to prevent spamming, they were never intended to supplement mining rewards until the mining reward schedule ran out and the currently meager fees are worth something more considerable. An experiment in creating fee market pressures is arguably experimenting with breaking the ~15 year mining reward plan and thus its quite elegant plan to slowly bring scarcity up, and with it the value, to ensure that when the mining reward schedule is complete, the value is high enough to sustain Bitcoin's security while only paying miners fees.

The point I was going for had not thing to do with transaction fees and only to do with decentralization.

Core decided to make Bitcoin a commodity instead of a currency through inaction and foot dragging a little more than a year ago. Some even championed the fee market as a good thing. There may no longer be a chance to change our minds. Many of us warned that allowing a fee market to form was a point of no return. Why would profit-driven miners want to give up these juicy fees? As he said in the interview, Bitcoin will continue maybe even with $100 transaction fees with inaction. That seems quite a lucrative future position for miners.

But this is one of the few lines of questioning at the defendant directly and not through his attorney. Your attorney, the prosecutor, and you just had a meeting and agreed to terms of a plea deal in a conference room, making promises if you plead guilty. You quickly go back into court and wait for the prosecutor to disappear for awhile and come back. Then the prosecutor comes back, then the judge, and they start talking and then the judge asks you the coercion line which usually includes, "have anyone made any promises to you", and you naturally double take and stumble. As much as you know this is how it works, you don't want to say anything misleading or incorrect to the judge. It seems your lawyer rarely informs you of this awkward position. Even if he did, what would he say? "The judge is going to ask you if you were made promises, say 'No' despite us just making agreeing to this plea deal promises."

Huh? No. It is not as hard to understand as you are making out to be. If you are profit driven in a very competitive market where huge investments in equipment are required, you might not want to artificially inflate profits and then take that away. You might run off many people that got burned. In the Bitcoin mining industry, these people that run off are a loss of our security. It is a matter of not cutting the legs out from under an industry you rely on.


That is because they wanted a size increase, but were instead given SegWit and misleadingly told it was a size increase. Then it took too long and the fee market pressure was allowed to form anyways. This fee market pressure was considered the point-of-no-return, as removing it would cut the legs out from underneath miners and thus our security. It was the reason for haste in increasing the size limit. 
@_date: 2016-12-06 21:09:13
Most of the criticisms of this wrongly assume you have to fill only one block up, before the criticism breaks down. The $ numbers are lame and misleading. Percentages should have been used instead.
To impact confirmations and to affect fees, you must approach the following percents:
 * 10% of the block needs filled to spam a 1MB block right now, and thus 10% of each block's fees.
 * 45% of the block needs filled to spam a 2MB block right now, picking up 45% of each block's fees.
@_date: 2016-12-14 17:18:01
That would be nice if that was the case, but that is not entirely true. There are many foot notes to that number, making it more of wishful thinking in the best case scenario, than a reasonably assumed fact. In the mean time the dreaded fee market has started to form already while SegWit is just now hoping to roll out and its effects on block size are a long ways away.
@_date: 2016-12-28 17:22:52
Isn't there usually markup involved too? I've never used one, but I assume if a markup was present as well, then just the fee could be misleading as to what you get compared to the current value of Bitcoin.

You realize your dreaded hard fork is in the Bitcoin Core scaling roadmap right? Such fear, many forks.
Only a very tiny subset of people want the block size limit completely removed. People wanted the block size raised last year before the fee market pressure of no return had established. Now, once that fee market pressure is relieved, from the pipe dreams of SegWit or any other reason, it will completely cut the feet out from underneath miners jeopardizing our security. SegWit is nice and brings nice features, but let's face it, the scaling aspect of SegWit is massively exagerated.

SegWit is cool, relying on it as a block size increase is just misleading. It may possibly effectively increase the transactions per block in some small group of types of transactions when everything is just perfect. Otherwise, SegWit is not scaling as it has been sold;it is just a cool feature.

The issue isn't even realistically existent without a malicious player with around $40K to toss around, technical expertise, and another few $10K's of resources to cloudify their DDoS attack on our ecosystem.
The real issue is how weak and vulnerable the community is to fear and manipulation as proven by this issue and how easily the massive amount of hashing power was manipulated into changing their rules based on a little lobbying and FUD, against the general community.

This is not true and shows a much repeated lack of understanding about the code and distribution of Tor exit nodes compared to Bitcoin nodes.
This is also exasperated by the fact that you don't need to sustain a DDoS on a node, you only need to momentarily fill it periodically. This allows you to use very few resources to hit many nodes in a short amount of time, then come back and hit each again, effectively keeping Tor (or low priority IPs) off the targeted nodes. Prioritize your node targets and one needs to hit very few of the nodes.

Yes, relying on the HTTPS exit node list which isn't the greatest.
The main problem I saw was that a denial of service could be super easy to knock all Tor node connections off of a node, preventing Tor nodes from connecting to it. This denial of service could target one node at a time for a fast and super low resource attack. The attacker then needed only to iterate nodes one at a time doing this process, then circle back hitting the previous nodes again to keep Tor users perpetually unable to connect to any nodes.
The attacker could connect with a Tor node first, to know when they've all been shoved off. This makes it super fast and easy, especially since their was no randomization to knocking connections from "low priority" (ie Tor) nodes off.

The Tor de-prioritization ("blacklist") is poorly conceived and can be used to prevent Tor users from connecting from some/most/all nodes with little effort through periodic disconnection. 
Think of it like a simple periodic wifi de-auth attack. Momentarily fill up a node, disconnecting all Tor users from it, then move to the next. There is no need to DDoS the entire network, just DDoS one node at a time periodically. Prioritize likely nodes and you can avoid bothering with unlikely to be used ones. Keep hitting hard coded master nodes and prevent new clients that want to be Tor-only-connection-anonymous from ever getting node discoveries.

Well, I do agree that balancing that reward for processing larger blocks would take some careful calculation, yet we already have a system that uses fees as reward for processing. 
Unfortunately, it seems the details of miners being able to include transactions, especially doing so for free, in a block they find, kinda kills the technical feasibility of the plan so far as I can figure. A miner can mix and match transactions in his block to purposely boost (or lower) the blocksize. This allows for some unacceptable possibilities, like boosting the blocksize until most miners cannot participate. Maybe there is a similar solution which works around this, but proposition  isn't not looking good as is.
@_date: 2015-08-13 17:54:34

It seems merely an extension to the incentive program to me. Larger blocks require more resources, thus to increase the block size, this would require the sufficient incentive to do so. This simultaneously de-incentives transaction spamming by refusing to increase blocksize when there is not enough fees, making spammed transactions more costly to manipulate block size.
This may impact users/services that make lots of transactions with out sufficient fees, but miners have little incentive to service dust with any priority anyways.
If implemented right, it seems like this could all balance out and be very fair for all players.

They are concerned that multipools would successfully attack an altcoin hard fork. They have some kind of concern that Bitcoin would eventually fail as a direct result of the ability to softfork given by SegWit. They don't give specifics on how so, but one could speculate that they assume developers would have full control to make poor decisions. They do imply it would take some time and mention vaguely about softforks making the coin "dirty" with new technical features.

Yes, the current high activity is causing the limitation to really be noticed and become a problem. Merchants are directly feeling this limitation hurt their ability to accept Bitcoins.
Trying to find blame and ulterior motivations behind technical problems and decisions is fallacy thinking. People are very prone to such illogical thinking.

To me, all purchase sources have trade offs, between fees, risk, time, and privacy. It is best to have options so you can weigh what is right for you.
One option is  simple, fast, and up front. They sell Bitcoins for PayPal. They require an initial correspondence of identification. Their markup includes fees and costs that individual sellers don't have, but they don't require the risk of trusting random strangers and they are very up front with their rate. Minimum purchase for Bitcoin is $3.

No matter what, without some kind of pruning or checkpointing, if you process more transactions in the same amount of time and keep a record of each transaction, it is going to increase the size of the block chain quicker. 
No matter if we do nothing different, eventually the block chain is going to get larger until it becomes unreasonable to store and transfer. Larger blocks will only speed this problem IF the extra block size is used. So, if we aren't holding back transactions due to full capacity, then the large blocks will have no detrimental effect above the current storage and bandwidth requirements. Yet, I think we have several approaches to managing the ever growing block chain in the works.

Many people are seeing that SegWit and other scaling options are not coming to fruit any time soon. Slow transactions and high fees are a constant problem now, really hurting Bitcoin, and seriously pushing merchants and services away from Bitcoin. Raising the block size would be a temporary measure, but would ease these problems until some solutions could be agreed upon. The complications of a hard fork make this seem an unrealistic solution to me, but if it could be done with reasonable safety, it would be a great stop gap and buy us a couple years.

Think of it this way.... You have 1 BTC on an exchange and tomorrow it is worth $10,000. It is not a good idea to use an exchange account as a bank, so your best course of action would be to withdraw your Bitcoins to your personal wallet. You can always deposit  a much smaller amount later.The problem is that most people would have the same idea and frantically withdraw their Bitcoins as well. This may overwhelm the exchange and cause some delay processing withdraws.  This exchange temporarily has insanely abnormal amounts of value it is holding for people. For this extended period you will have to trust that the exchange will remain honest.

Are you paid by CoinWallet? Are you PR?
Defrauding is causing one to have financial losses. If your value is stuck for a month, you definitely have incurred losses. They don't have to take your money, just cause you to lose it.
They are giving the money away, because they realized they are liable for their previous actions and have expressed intent of a crime. This still constitutes an action that follows through their intent of a crime, even it if is done through giving away money. It all comes down to intent. -see previous example for dumping cash off a building with the intent of causing damage/injury/losses as being a crime.
Small fees are hardly excessive, unless multiplied by 100's of thousands of times. The amount defrauded from each individual is inconsequential. Sunkist tuna just paid out a class action lawsuit for skimping 0.02 ounces from each can of tuna.
LEO is for criminal actions and civil court is for civil liability. Both are extremely relevant and appropriate for these expressly criminal and civilly liable acts.

Just a terrible and deceptive video. He basically says Bitcoin Core is ran by one person. Bitcoin is decided never to change from 1MB block size limit. That there is an urgent scalability problem that can only be fixed by XT because nothing else is coded yet. That the largest Chinese mining pools picked the 8MB compromise because "8 is a lucky number", not because they were concerned that Their Internet infrastructure would cause the initially proposed 20MB to exclude them, half of Bitcoin's hashing power, from participating. What a pile of rubbish.

DDoS Bitcoin causing people's transactions to stall for a month, which means they lost money, through opportunity, degradation of their provided services, or interest if nothing else. They were purposely deprived of control of their value/commodity through express coinwallet's actions.
You may say that making Bitcoin transactions is not illegal, but neither is making HTTP requests to a website. Yet, purposely DDoSing a website with HTTP request to degrade or impede service causing losses is illegal criminally and a civilly liable action.

@_date: 2015-09-08 15:59:30
These both seem to deceptively ignore some facts/history and cherry pick others. The block size was made limited due to attack concerns by miners and the problems very large blocks could cause on miners without sufficient bandwidth, i.e. half of the mining power of Bitcoin, which comes from China and has limited outgoing bandwidth. One link is pushing Lightning network and the other XT's SPV focused client. Both have financial motivations/backer and are biased.
Bitcoin with a 1MB block size cap can theoretically handle about 7 transactions per second, depending you who ask this can be down to a little more than 6 TPS. Currently we are using 0.18 transactions per second (this is very volatile but hasn't gone up to 1 TPS for the last 10 minutes while I watched) and our network is currently being attacked by spam transactions from those financially motivated people who keep paying for crap articles and XT or we all die FUD. We may spike at moments, but there is no dire, urgent need, for more Bitcoin "circulation" capacity, as you put it. There is no limiting holding us back caused by 1MB. In the near future of one or two years, this may become cumbersome, which is why there is discussion. People pretending there is gloom and doom urgent current issues are being deceptive. You should ask yourself, "Why are they being deceptive? Why are they pretending this is an urgent issue? What do they stand to gain?"
@_date: 2015-09-10 19:55:03
Intent to defraud requires no illegal action, just intent and action. If I expressly say that I intend to dump $100 bills off the top of a building to cause a riot, I can and will be civilly liable for the riot damage and criminally liable for several things, even though dumping money is not illegal. If I just dump the money off, without stating my intentions of causing losses to others, several of those things are much more difficult to follow through in court.
@_date: 2015-09-03 19:25:56
I don't think anyone said the network would crumble. This is your typical false dichotomy. Chinese miners said 32MB was too high and suggested 8MB, but most people just want a reasonable longer term solution.

I've not seen "memory pool backlog" wording used, just "backlog". Regardless, what do you think a mem pool backlog does? Currently their are [87K+ unconfirmed transactions]( backlog of transactions. People who have made transactions but their coins are stuck in limbo. These are people intentionally deprived of the value/commodity through purposeful actions. 
People can make their transfer as long as they pay excessive fees, happens to use a Bitcoin client which supports that, know about the malicious attack on the network ahead of time, and are technologically advanced enough to know that is how you side step being defrauded by the hackers' actions.

Until they transfer the coins into a wallet that only they control, sweeping the coins, they aren't the only people that control those coins. Importing the keys isn't enough, because multiple people are importing the same keys and trying to be the first to transfer the coins out of it to their private wallet address. That is why first to sweep wins. Nothing really double spend about it, Bitcoin has the specific system against double spending. Back log isn't drastic currently, only about [7K unconfirmed transactions.](

BU isn't even in the picture anymore. SegWit isn't the only option. Resistance to what you want isn't necessarily just some singular evil entities. Scapegoating skews logical decisions and focus on particular demonized miners, public figures, and some maybe possible conspiracy about asic boost. This is just distracting people from technical discussion with emotion and polarizing us versus them attitudes.
What you are calling "reporting" is actually just misleading people. Reporting percentages that are easily gamed as meaning something, is misleading. It is lying to people. There is no way to analyses those nodes and rule out sibyl. It is not possible. Sure you can weed out a couple as grouped, but it is super easy to game without being able to tell. It is a worthless misleading metric.

Anyone can fork Bitcoin right now and connect to the network, but they cannot make protocol changes without consensus, otherwise their attempts at invalid transactions will be ignored. This consensus is the gauge, backed by proof of work, to gauge acceptance of protocol changes. 
Currently, that requires miner consensus; miners will not confirm invalid transactions. This also requires node consensus; nodes will not relay invalid messages. That is the checks-and-balances that protect the Bitcoin in a decentralized way from rouge protocol changes. 
SegWit removes the requirements for miner consensus on many protocol changes. This removes a key part of the checks-and-balances, centralizing protocol governance more-so into the hands of developers. This makes taking control of Bitcoin as a whole closer to simply requiring having control over development of the most popular client, rather than also needing control over consensus of mining hashrate.

By not creating a dangerous "fee market" in the first place, which miners would greedily leave without after getting a taste. Once transactions are using excessive fees to fight to get on the block chain, we've all lost in my opinion. This is what happens if we let the block size fill up to the limit. This seems to be intentionally what core devs are doing. It is baffling as so many people have been warning against this disastrous scenereo of developing a "fee market". It makes you worried that $5 per transaction fees (for same day transaction) are coming in a year or two and for some reason that is what core devs want.

That only works if a significant portion of the miners are mining to the rules you want. Otherwise, A, B, and C, may have different opinions of which chain is longer. A longer chain that does not follow the rules you as a node or miner are enforcing, is not a longer chain...to you. The soft forks in the past were very minor changes, additional features such as opcodes, they were not significant restructuring of how transaction hashes are located, generated, validated, and used. I think this invalidates the argument that UASF worked before.

There are technical reasons to oppose SegWit and miners have decided to oppose it. Exchanges are likely to go with whatever seems the most likely outcome, because they don't care about technical outcomes. This makes UASF likely to succeed, because it is easy to fake support, enough to get exchanges on board, which is where the real support comes from.
@_date: 2017-05-22 20:54:45
Users don't mine blocks, so they can't form chains. Their rejections of blocks is pointless, unless someone is mining blocks they accept. Miners decide, whether you like it or not, not economic participants. That is just some UASF nonsense talk of FUD'ing economic participants into censoring valid chains to thwart consensus. It is just smoke and mirrors that gives users a warm fuzzy feeling, but doesn't work without miner consensus, hence all the fears of forking from that risky nonsense.

@_date: 2017-05-25 14:57:39
Be on the Bitcoin side. Do nothing and allow the very few, but very loud, UASF cheerleaders to convince a few suckers to run their businesses into the ground. UASF sucker-businesses will simply filter most transactions and not see the whole blockchain as Bitcoin keeps working normally after August.
UASF only works if most exchanges and payment processors all censor the blockchain. We already see a couple being tricked into doing this. They are being tricked into thinking if they don't, they will make Bitcoin users mad an risk hurting the Bitcoin system by causing a fork. 
Strong arming and FUD'ing economic members into making technical changes in Bitcoin is quite a terrible strategy. These economic members don't understand the technical changes they are being forced to decide on and they don't care. There is no way to gauge community support, so UASF is proof by trickery; mob-rules.
If you want to do something, run a full node, or several of them, which are not signaling for UASF. This will help to offset the percentage of nodes signaling UASF. Everyone knows node signalling is easily gamed, each person can run dozens of nodes, or hundreds with a little money. Yet, people will still use the useless and easily faked node percentage of signaling nodes to tick economic members into thinking a majority of users support UASF, proof of trickery.
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:31:53
UASF is just as unsafe as hard forking, maybe more so, if there isn't a really good consensus by miners, economic members, AND users. UASF isn't just adding an opcode like last time, it is some real changes. It also has very questionable support, especially from miners.
I'd argue that a hard fork to larger blocks is likely much much safer, since there has been consensus all around for larger blocks for years. Miners, users, and everyone have been all but begging for larger blocks for a long time. Perplexingly, we've been told SegWit or nothing without much reasoning.
No one has really shown how larger blocks are not viable. We know it isn't and infrastructure concern, as Chinese miners have agreed at least a year ago that they could handle 8MB blocks. All we've been really given was vague hand waving about spamming concerns. These haven't been proven with testing, quantified with numbers, or even fully explained as far as I know.
Maybe Bitcoin will be some Visa-like payment processor down the road with fancy Lightening Network or other layers, but the main goal should be keeping Bitcoin working now.
SegWit has some interesting features and gives you a lot of flexibility, but the more you look at it, the more concerning it appears. Maybe those concerning parts aren't such a big deal, like bastardizing the way the hash is used, to put the transactions in the sub hash, or that seemingly cool script versioning, causing outdated nodes not to verify scripts. Even so, it is quite an increase in complexity, especially to transaction protocol compatibility, and if the law of unintended consequences had an alarm, it would be buzzing like crazy.
Concern is just concern, though and may be unfounded. Yet, pushing a concerning complex multi-feature addition, when what users, miners, and economic members really desperately want and need is scaling, seems worth lots and lots of questioning and criticism.
@_date: 2015-11-30 23:02:11
Miners are always in a pecarious position where they've invested in hardware and are sinking more money into utilities, but don't expect to return on investment for awhile. This is risk; what if something happens and you never get ROI, rather on a worth while profit? Since long term is higher risk, it makes perfect incentivized business sense for miners to always go for reasonably increased short term gains.


That is for when the block reward runs out in ~20-ish years and didn't really focus on purposely constraining the block size against more volume of transactions than it can handle to create a fee market that competed for spots in those blocks.

1) There are reasons to be concerned if not oppose SegWit. They are all very technical, but the main non-technical answer is that SegWit is many things gobbed together, some good, some sketchy, and some scary. It is a huge increase in complexity, obfuscated with many changes together, making it way too hard for anyone to understand without massively deep technical review. People like some key features of it, but ignore the rest. They feel like there is no other option. They think it is mainly a scaling solution.

It isn't the "great firewall of China" that is the issue, it is an infrastructure limitation. Five of China’s biggest mining pools, 55% to 60% of all of Bitcoin's hashing power, coming to an agreement at the National Conference Center in Beijing on a 8MB compromise. "We believe that this is a realistic short term adjustment that remains fair to all miners and node operators worldwide."

For the next 4 months or so, then the fee market will begin. We likely won't be able to remove the fee market once started, without losing a large portion of our mining security. Who wants to go back to the near zero profits that PoW mining was designed to have when you have a taste of transaction fee extortion and its ATM-fee-like profits?
You're right, Bitcoin won't die, but it will become an expensive to transfer commodity, no longer feasible for use as a currency. This isn't irrational fear, just look at the average block size chart and speculate your own projection. Once you have to pay a $5 fee to get miners to process your transaction because the blocks are full and have created a 'highest-fee actually gets processed' market, the reality of the situation will sink in, but it will be too late to reverse it.

Good question. I cannot answer that and neither can you. One can only make assumptions and speculations.


Spam with no fees wouldn't have much of an impact on transactions with fees. 


No, not really. This issue still remains. We've known about the mempool issue for years. It is less of an issue than the one that caused us to require a block size cap. The mempool issue just kills nodes that are improperly configured and have very low resources. If we open the flood gate on the block size cap, we open our self up to *real* DDoS issues.
@_date: 2015-11-30 22:46:34
I think if a fee market is created, then we cannot remove it without losing a large portion of our mining security. PoW mining was designed to scale maintaining near-zero-profit mining. Once blocks fill we will force people to outbid the fee of the current transactions in mempool to make sure their transaction is processed at all, rather on in a timely manner. What miner wants to accept "a low enough fee", when ATM-fee's are extort-able from users who want to fight to make transactions amongst heavy competition? Miners will always destroy Bitcoin for short term profits if given the ability to do so, because longer term has more risk. Bitcoin would quickly become a expensive to exchange commodity tool, eventually with higher fees than a money transfer, and no longer feasible to use as a currency by a long shot. This is what happens if we purposely don't scale Bitcoin. This deviates from the original idea of Bitcoin the currency that lets you 'be your own bank'. This is called selling out. Do we want to sell out Bitcoin and jump on some alt-coin wagon such as Lightning Network, Litecoin, or Dogecoin for the real crypto currency adopted world wide?

UASF doesn't require a percentage of nodes. It actually requires no consensus from the community at all; users, nodes, economic members, or miners. 
That makes UASF violate the Bitcoin community guidelines. 


UASF/BIP148 is a targeted attack of just a small few key economic members like exchanges, light wallets, and payment processors, to trick, FUD, and strong-arm them into filtering non-SegWit blocks/transactions with their nodes. It is a malicious centralized coup of the Bitcoin network by a small mob of people using propaganda, forum canvasing, and general trickery. If successful, it highlights the complete failure of Bitcoin's decentralized security and consensus system.

UASF is a risky nuclear option, pitting a against b against c. No chain is forced to die that has miners. If it has miners it has nodes. The chain with the most miners is the most secure chain. No matter how warm and fuzzy it feels you tell yourself that exchanges and users have a voice, ultimately miners decide.

The miners have decided against it. The only safe way to vote is with hashing power consensus because that cannot be faked to vote more than once, like UASF can be (sibyl attack). Maybe miners can be convinced eventually, but it will probably require reassurances and organization of development power structures, not simply waiting for them to come aboard.

You are making a ton of assumptions. Your first assumption is that the 569 nodes that 21.co can't see are even down, rather on crashed. You even had to incorrectly say that I cited that. 
Your second assumption, that [the attacker] doesn't have to pay for it, is obviously wrong. The spam attack that started last night has fees. You seem to make the assumption that larger blocks would prevent the mempool from backing up. It is hard to be sure of that, but reasonable to assume it would help. The problem is that the larger blocks would would cause a different kind of spam issue. 
For most naive people that don't remember, the 1MB cap was added to combat spam attacks! Now that new types of spam attacks are using abusing the system, silly people are calling for removing the cap, but are laughably ignorant of the past and how the caps are there to prevent another type of spam attack.

Of course it completely refutes the point. It means we can only know who participated in any minute way, but not know to what degree they participated. Without knowing the degree of participation, there is no way to speculate distribution of control/development. Even the premise that commits can infer control is flawed logic, when commits are selectively merged.

Pretty scary! It looks like it would be much safer just to up the blocksize to, say like 4MB. SegWit isn't needed for side chains like Lightening Network and SegWit isn't really a scaling solution. The side effect of scaling a little bit in some certain situations that SegWit gives, will be almost full by the time it rolls out anyways. That is, if this doesn't split Bitcoin into two separate coins completely killing its value for the next decade.

SegWit is implemented in core to require an activation threshold. That means users running that version of core do not support SegWit without consensus. Nothing preposterous about that. What is preposterous is misleading people into thinking people running nodes that support a feature if consensus if found, also support that feature without consensus.
@_date: 2017-05-23 13:59:43
If hash rate consensus is screwed, then bitcoin is screwed. 
This economic consensus stuff is crap. It cannot be gauged, just faked. Forcing economic parties to choose a side on technical details they don't understand will likely damage the economy. This is an attempt to use FUD and sibyl node signal percentages to trick economic parties into thinking the community has decided, when really, they are being strong armed into deciding for the community.
UASF creates a precedence of mob rules, destroys consensus, and decentralizes Bitcoin.
SegWit does change consensus rules by allowing protocol changes with soft forks, that would have required a hard fork and full hash rate consensus before. It removes the check-and-balance of consensus for some protocol changes, in a dangerous stripping of Bitcoin's security. That is SegWit's main feature, soft fork protocol changes! Also, arguably fixing malleability, but scaling a tiny bit, one time, was always just a side effect.
You should give a damn about devs if you plan on giving them the entire keys to the protocol castle with SegWit. Compromising their decision making would be the only thing left between Bitcoin and a government or malicious actor take over.
@_date: 2015-10-01 14:02:40
I don't know if the users are competent to be in charge either. This decision needs to be a careful technical one. It is a decision for researchers, developers, and experts in my opinion.
While miners' incentives are what matters to ensure they do what is best for the users and system as a whole, these incentives are crafted, limited, and focused by the technical rules established by the developers and the Bitcoin design.
Given too much control (as I feel BIP100 is last I've read of it), or any control without strict boundaries, I think miners are incentivized to do bad things. The urge for mining domination, by excluding other miners when able, and short term profits over long term system viability, are going to be real and incentivized. 
It is easy to say that miners have an incentive to make Bitcoin good for users so it continues to prosper, but when mining profit margins are ever shrinking and mining hardware is becoming out dated by the week, short term gains take a front seat row over long term Bitcoin success. You can think of MtGox and apply the same assumption that they had long term incentive not to rip people off and to do good for their customers and Bitcoin as a whole. Yet, short term gains and an exit become enticing.
@_date: 2015-10-07 15:32:06
While this is true, the implied notion that we are maxing out our capacity and being held back currently is simply incorrect.
Bitcoin throughput is [limited to a sustainable 7 tps currently]( and we are no where near that. The [block sizes have sat around 400KB for the entire year,]( more or less. Even the DDoS "stress" attack barely touched doubling that once. Our [transactions per day are steadily increasing]( with a very predictable and gradual increase.
Yet, we are very far from capacity.
Even if Bitcoin usage doubles this years, we still only need to increase the block size in about a year. No urgent big hurry. We have plenty of time to consider as much information as possible to make one long term change.

Yes, it was implied that the longest chain was also *valid*. Yes, user activated soft forks work when miners have consensus. Miners do decide the rules, by rejecting **invalid** blocks.

I think psudo calculations (which others accompanying this thread appear flawed) are deceptive. That article just suggest musicians get paid directly with Bitcoins. That may imply an increase in Bitcoin usage. Since we have tons of head room in blocksize and transactions per second currently, we should be able to handle even a large adoption from the music industry for at least a year as we are implemented now.
Yes, we need a long term solution. Merely increasing the blocksize is probably super short sighted. As Satoshi said, most transactions will eventually happen off block chain or on side chains. The simplest way seems to be AltCoins to me. If you want data in your blockchain, you make an altcoin for that specific purpose. If you want tons of micro transactions for tipping artists you use Dogecoin, Litecoin, or make your own altcoin, then convert and payout artists in Bitcoins. Many tips, such wow!
Bitcoin is never going to be everything for everyone. We need to decide what it can and will be, then build around that. We shouldn't let project creep take over, when spinning up a new coin for a specific task is so easy. If the task has utility, the coins will have value. If the coins have value, people will secure it by mining blocks for it.

Frequently CF sites cannot be accessed by Tor. CF provides a fake HTTPS access to all sites, but many sites don't support this properly and redirect to the HTTP site. The captcha for non-HTTPS CF is completely and totally impossible! If you find a CF site that properly works with HTTPS, then you are good with a 3 or 4 number street address captcha. If not, you are doomed with impossible nonsense captchas.
**Edit:** This is the kind of captcha Cloud Flair gives you when you try to access an HTTP site from Tor. You may think you know what it is, but I assure you, it will be wrong. I've solved hundreds of them to no avail. They are literally impossible.
Think it is "urnnmrnuc thrmttg" ?  Me too, but NO you are wrong! ha ha. It is really impossible/bugged.
If you connect to an HTTPS site through Cloud Flair, you get a simple captcha that actually works and the HTTPS cert is "faked", ie a cert from cloudflaressl.com with no ownership or verification information, with connection "partially encrypted". That is if you are lucky, many sites aren't built to support the HTTP vrs HTTPS and will redirect strait to a HTTP link, slamming you with the impossible captcha.

Miners need rules and boundaries, thoughtfully crafted to incentivize what is good for the Bitcoin user. The easy although cliche example is that MtGox had every incentive to do their customers and Bitcoin right to keep their business rolling. We see that this is does not always work. When profits margins are tight and ASIC hardware is outdated way before you bought it, short term profits and an exit becomes more inticing.

You've been told too many times how to feel about SegWit, with out learning enough. You think it is your team versus the other team. Mindlessly polarized the situation to divide and conquer. Think deeper.
You realize that side chains don't require SegWit, right? You realize that SegWit makes a major governance change thwarting consensus and putting protocol power fully in the devs, right? Do you fully trust your development team not to be compromised by wealthy or even government actors? Currently, compromising the development team does nothing as PoW-backed miner consensus is needed for protocol changes. SegWit is a huge blow to Bitcoin's decentralization security. It can be used to coup the entire system, by compromising the development team, or simply the pull request gatekeepers.

What is the simple problem as they see it? It might not be what others see. SegWit is kind of complicated and it does several things, such as improving transaction malleability problems, allowing soft forks for some protocol changes that would normally require a hard fork, and as a side effect, it would effectively increase the blocksize somewhat, in away. It sounds like they are calling the insufficient blocksize the only 'problem'. SegWit had been less than honestly touted as a blocksize increase, but that is not really what it is. It definitely would be a complicated solution to that problem. Just increasing the blocksize would be simple, but it would require a hard fork and miner consensus, which bears some risks. Then where do you raise it too, because it might need raised again later? So simple, but risky and only temporary isn't super appealing. SegWit solves several problems, the least of which is the full blocks.

You simply fall out of the economy for your efforts.

Remember, the mining difficulty automatically regulates miner revenue/profitability. Miner's revenue don't need to be supplemented with fees and we don't need to concern ourselves with questions of if mining is profitable or not. That is already baked into Bitcoin and fees are only meant to discourage spam and dust, not making mining profitable. Only in 20 years are miners to rely or even slightly concern themselves with the profitability of transaction fees. Trying to force a fee market 20 years early will break the system.
@_date: 2015-11-06 21:52:22
I think what is written and implemented is irrelevant, but otherwise I agree. I mean BIP 100 is terrible and seems dangerous. Why do we waste so much time talking about it? BIP 103 is a failure because it waits too long before starting, 2017. By then the 17.7% increase a year is way too little too late. I don't think Bitcoin will be able to function that long without dumping a lot of adoption. Anything that doesn't raise the block size limit within a hand full of months is nothing but stupid in my opinion. I can think of no reason to stick with small blocks or why sticking with small blocks wouldn't be the death of Bitcoin by the end of the next year at the latest. We should increase carefully with a complete scaling solution, instead of simply cranking the block size limit up. Maybe BIP101 is too aggressive, I don't know, yet there is no viable future if we do not increase the block size limit soon. I feel if we allow a miner fee market to be created, we have already failed.

But now everyone seems to be demanding a hard fork. Miners seem to be demanding a hard fork, possibly refusing SegWit without one. 
SegWit is a pipe dream that won't magically make blocks bigger. It requires every wallet to make special transactions to even benefit at all from SegWit. The roll-out time for SegWit is huge because of this. 
We won't be seeing any benefit from SegWit any time soon, even if it is soft forked out today. Everyone knows this, so why with the deceptive stalling and calling anyone pointing out reality FUD?
@_date: 2017-05-29 17:03:38
SegWit is not a scaling solution, it just holds hashes differently, completely changing how transactions are stored into a much more complicated system. This affords a slight increase of *effective* block size, but will already be full!
SegWit is not an off-chain scaling solution. Off chain scaling solutions like Lightening Network do not require SegWit. SegWit would make them easier and with the current concepts cleaner to implement, but better solutions could be made to work without SegWit.
Bitcoin badly needs scaling, but SegWit is not a scaling solution.

You seem to missed what I said about supporting larger blocks. You also seem to have missed what I said about not supporting a competitive mining market.
Well, for a canned pro-large block response, you seem to be thinking pretty two dimensionally. Block size isn't everything with scaling. That is where many people are failing conceptually.
You also seem to expect miners to do what is incentivized, but ignore that they are incentivized to do bad for short term gains.
You also seem to think that transaction spamming is the only attack that can be done. You must remember that the block size limit was reduced to 1MB to prevent attacks. 
We have to realize that when we increase blocksize that we open a whole can of worms of problems and attacks. We also have to realize that we need to raise the blocksize before this detrimental mining fee market develops. From the chart we have plenty of time to pull this off in a sane longterm way, instead of a simplistic kneejerk only bump of the block size limit and ignore everything reaction.

That is just a deceptively silly way to look at it. It is an increase of only about 2x throughput (average transactions) for about 4x max block size raise (maximum).

Yes, the miners find consensus to mine on the chain they chose for the hard fork. The users use the longest chain. By virtue of these two things, primarily the consensus of miners, every peer on the network finds consensus.
Miner consensus is the voting over protocol governance of Bitcoin. Without this consensus, protocol changes are rejected.
While centralization of mining is a concern, proof of work backed consensus is the only reliable decision making, which cannot be faked.
@_date: 2017-05-22 16:49:46
Miners must find consensus to implement protocol changes. This is a hard fork. SegWit changes this to allow some protocol changes with soft forks, without consensus, instead of hard forks. This takes away consensus voting governance for the Bitcoin protocol and gives it fully to the Bitcoin core developers. Of course users could use any wallet software they like, but currently there isn't enough diversity in wallet software to keep governance decentralized. This becomes a security problem that allows malicious actors or government entities to compromise Bitcoin by simply compromising the core developer or their decision making process.

Nodes are not votes. Nodes run software that allow features based on consensus (miner votes). Miners are the only ones that can vote, because miner votes are backed by work. Nodes can't vote, because they are backed by nothing and can be easily faked.


They aren't expressing the one you are deceptively framing. Their opinion is that if miner consensus creates the longest chain with SegWit support, they will follow it. You are misleading people to think they support SegWit based on running this software, ignoring the fact that this support is conditional on the previously stated miner consensus.
No installing software is not a vote for node operators. Nodes can be faked and are not a way to make votes in Bitcoin. Your expression of support can only be measured with hashrate. This is a proof of work system, without work, their is no proof that a thousand votes aren't one person. 
You can criticize the centralization of mining all you want and argue that mining pools singularly make thousands of votes. That may be true in some regaurds, but it does not make the previous not true, that node voting is meaningless and easily gamed.

I think the spam attacks were done by those supporting, pushing for, not only bigger blocks, but specifically the XT implementation. This is due to financial interest in the hidden SPV agendas that come along with XT.
I don't think small block proponents think that is premature, but are more concerned with the risks of attacks opened up with larger blocks. It is clear that if we wait longer than that, we have a small block mining fee market, where it would be difficult to remove that market later. Any increase in block size would need scaled to maintain a comparable mining market to not disrupt incentive to mine. I think moving to a larger blocksize before that trap materializes would be better, but I don't think simply increasing the blocksize is the answer. We need a full scaling solution. If we simply increase blocksize, we will be at big risks for attack.

Those companies developing services around certain uses of the blockchain have a financial incentive to push for larger blocks right now. They have paid dearly for a spam attack to push us into a kneejerk reaction of doing so. 
We as users of Bitcoin have no financial interest in bigger blocks until it starts putting fee pressure on transactions. So for the general Bitcoin user, we have NO interest in bigger blocks until about mid next year according to the chart. And even then we have a huge interest against the possible attacks that larger blocks will open up. We have the most interest in a careful, well planned, complete scaling solution, instead of a risky, careless, kneejerk, blocksize increasing only plan to kick the can down the road.

Since usage and adoption was held back by fees and long confirm times, I don't think we can accurately assume how much deficient in throughput we are with the current limitations. We can say that we've been *'at least'* 15% deficient, but that is about it. If we had a 15% throughout increase, we may have attracted 50% or more usage. It is purely speculation and no one can predict usage, but I suspect by the time SegWit rolls out, it will almost be full already.

As others have said, there are many trolls that don't want Bitcoin to succeed. There are even groups dedicated to this. These forums also have people of many levels of involvement. People who have seen many newcomer mistakes are less likely to be empathetic to newcomers making mistakes and more likely to respond like, "that's what you get for using web wallets". It is a matter of common repetition and turning to a "just RTFM!" attitude. 
You have to realize that many real problems have heavily politicized solutions. Many with financial incentives behind them. Discussion about those problems heat up into campaigning, astroturfing, vote brigading, and spamming. Lots and lots of spamming trying to sidetrack every post into being about their issue and their support for one solution. This type of spamming and brigading is not conductive to discussion, frequently against the Reddit rules, and gets deleted. Spammers cry that it is "censorship", that they can't turn every post into a discussion about their interest. If you look into "censorship" claims, like 95% are someone spamming or breaking rules, then spending a month crying about being banned loudly in public. The other 5% just got caught in the crossfire when heavy brigading campaigns were going on.
A lot of the turning the other cheek to scammers falls under the 'RTFM' attitude and the fact that usually you can do nothing about it. Many times scams are also very difficult to identify. There are many scam-looking things that you cannot identify as surely a scam until afterwards. Criminal or immoral uses of Bitcoin are subjective. If it is clearly immoral, there is nothing you can do to stop them. If it is criminal, there are many people who probably don't think it should be. In the end you can't stop them either. So, there is no reason to let it bother you. Everyone knows there is a million fold more drug, money laundering, and child sex slave rings being funded by good old fashioned cash.

BIP148 does not require consensus from anyone and thus violates the community guidelines from this subreddit's side bar:


BIP148 attempts to force a contentious protocol change against the wishes of users and miners by simply enforcing new protocol rules on around a dozen exchanges' and payment processors' nodes. This bypasses all consensus requirements, making changes decided on by a very few easily manipulated individual companies. This shows a clear exploit to Bitcoin's decentralized protocol security and shows that governments and malicious actors can easily take over (coup) Bitcoin's governance with a little propaganda, some deception of a naive community, some free hats, and by coercing a tiny few economic nodes into enforcing protocol changes. If successful, BIP148 proves Bitcoin's decentralized protocol security is completely broken and thus Bitcoin as a whole is insecure.

Forcing Joe Smoe's coffee shop to make a decision on SegWit is not consensus. He will likely be hounded, tricked, and threatened into making his decision, instead of educating himself. The same goes for exchanges. They don't want to decide this crap, they just don't want to piss anyone off. So as long as you can trick them into thinking there is a community backed position, they will run with that and sibyl will win. SegWit does change things. The previous soft forks before were scripting changes and SegWit makes those simple opcodes to change. It is kinda sketchy design-wise and encourages older nodes not to validate newer scripts. Hash rate consensus is an important part of Bitcoin's security model, side stepping it once, or removing it forever, will only make Bitcoin less resilient to targeted take overs.

No. UASF is a form of centralization, through thwarting Bitcoin's consensus system and the majority of users, by compromising a few key economic members to censor the blockchain.

@_date: 2017-05-17 16:56:04
It is more than that in my opinion.
SegWit also has to do with centralization and control over the Bitcoin protocol. Currently, changes to the Bitcoin protocol require consensus from miners. SegWit effectively takes away the miner voting ability for many types of protocol changes. The miners don't like that. This would give the developers the ability to make protocol changes by making changes in the Bitcoin client, without requiring miner consensus. Not everyone has to use the same Bitcoin client, but let's face it, Bitcoin-qt core is the reference client. 
Also, SegWit paves the way for side chain implementations like Lightening Network. It is great for users, but likely to cannibalize fees from miners and thus their incentive for mining. How fees would play out on LN is arguable, but the block reward schedule decreases over time to where the miners must eventually sustain on the incentive of transaction fees alone. If side chains are eating most transaction fees and making the minimum amount of on-chain transactions possible, that could look like a poor situation for miners.

If nodes and miners agree, it is pretty well non-contentious. Miners can't realistically dictate protocol as nodes do validation. Yet, many people agreed to SegWit + 2X years ago, multiple times. The agreement was well established and understood. The chance that nodes will oppose it en mass seems low to me, but the reddit echo chamber would pretend it was totally opposed and those agreements never happened.
An 100mb block limit wouldn't mean a whole lot. Spamming blocks with transactions to become huge isn't really a concern anymore; it just isn't economically feasible like it used to be several years ago when the 1MB block size limit was enacted. So if the block limit was ridiculously high, block sizes would just be whatever size they need to sustain transactions and no more. This would keep fees and confirmation times to a minimum. Everything would work great. There is concern that when the actual size of the blocks grows too much, that network propagation time would entice miners to cheat and mine to SPV nodes or otherwise centralize mining to not their own non-full nodes, thus hurting security, anti-censorship, and decentralization. Chances are, if their Internet sucks that bad, then they are largely already doing that and an increase in block size or not won't sway them either way significantly.

We are talking about wallet software users. You are rambling on about miners. You seem very confused. You are misleading people to think that wallet software users with up-to-date core wallets support SegWit; they do not. They support SegWit activation ONLY with overwhelming consensus. You may not like miners, they are an easy scapegoat for the foolish, but that doesn't change the fact that all SegWit code in Bitcoin core requires miner consensus and therefore is not a general support for SegWit without miner consensus.

Ignore the circle jerk of empty rhetoric. These people don't even understand what they are cheer-leading for.
No, it won't mean higher fees per transaction. The initial softfork to SegWit will alleviate most of the fee pressure, returning Bitcoin to reasonable fees. While the fees will be lower, normal fees, the increase in throughput will allow more transactions per block, resulting in more fees possibly collected. 
There is a good chance that if recent year of full blocks, high fees, and slow confirmations didn't hurt adoption and usage too much, that after SegWit's ~2x increase in effective throughput, blocks will almost be full again already. Then the 2X hard fork part of SegWit2x will be next to increase the effective limit once again.
This is the same plan core had in their scaling roadmap more than a year ago, except they were wishy washy about when to do the 2X hard fork:
@_date: 2017-06-22 15:46:16
Which is a great reason to thank that a consensus on SegWit2x came along so the possibility of a centralized protocol change without overwhelming consensus, UASF BIP148, doesn't get attempted.

Users that don't understand what SegWit is, keep their wallet up to date. Of those 80% of people, only a tiny fraction know what SegWit is, rather on the technical concerns or merits. They are running software that says, "if miners overwhelmingly think SegWit is good, then I will allow it". 
This is a case of people being mislead into thinking people with up to date wallets are signalling for SegWit anyway-anyhow. This is wrong and I was told this doesn't happen.

On a very grand scale of things, you make an interesting long term theoretical point. 
Each coin has a token of some limited supply. Currently the supplies of some token, shouldn't effect the perceived supply of another token. Yet, at some point, you'd expect only so much limited wealth to be interested in crypto and that to be distributed among different coins, with their different limited tokens. If there was only one crypto coin token to chose from, it seems logical that it would envelope (mostly) all the crypto market cap of crypto interested wealth and have a higher valuable than if it had many competing crypto currencies.

Support for SegWit is not the same as UASF. UASF is support for protocol changes without overwhelming consensus. This breaks decentralization and thus Bitcoin's security.
Economic members don't decide protocol. Only significant miner support can make protocol changes. It makes you feel warm and fuzzy to track what members with zero say in the situation support, but it is ultimately useless. Economic members can decide to filter all of Bitcoin, but that doesn't change Bitcoin, only miners changing will.
Most economic members don't understand the issue, nor do they care, they just don't want to piss off their user base. Consensus isn't found by FUD'ing or threatening your vendor into supporting a cause that even you don't technically understand. That type of stuff is just for misleading charts, polls, and percentages touted by those who want to cheerlead for 'their team's side.'
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:45:15
I think that point seems mostly nonsense. If resources are that tight, would a dark net market really need a full node? That is the effective block size limit, not the actual block size.

This write up simply makes a misleading focus on what is a sufficient fee and says a whole lot of nothing with many words.

I think it will need considerable miners support if not 51% to be successful. Otherwise, the BIP148 chain users will be at risk. Their only way forward would be to split off their chain into an altcoin (any protocol changes without overwhelming consensus is an altcoin by definition). This is why it has been misleadingly portrayed as safe, because of naive ideas that this altcoin could survive even if Bitcoin proper rejects BIP148. That is reckless assumption. As UASF/BIP148 is an attack on Bitcoin if it doesn't have overwhelming consensus, it is likely that the overwhelming hash will attack the weaker BIP148 chain. If BIP148 doesn't attract massive miner support, then its forked chain will be super weak and insecure, simply due to lack of hashing power securing it. This will make it less valuable. Some people have this pie in the sky idea that the BIP148 chain will immediately be more valuable because of its SegWit utility and this value will attract miners immediately. This is wrong if it doesn't already have a large portion of miners support, as it will not have enough hash rate to be secure.
Technically, UASF BIP148 does not requires overwhelming consensus and thus its promotion breaks the community guidelines:

As long as whatever solution has overwhelming consensus. We must maintain the integrity of decentralized security that requiring overwhelming consensus for protocol changes gives.

I also run a 4th additional node in attempts to support Tor. You can see how cheap and easy it would be to grab a vpn or some cloud hosting and spin up a few dozen nodes.

I think you got that backwards. BIP148 has almost no support. SegWit2x has like 90% signalling support.  SegWit2x starts with a softfork, wich does not split the chain, and later does a hard fork to 2x, which also doesn't split the chain if there is consensus. BIP148 doesn't split, it simply creates a very small group of people ignoring the real Bitcoin in protest. Without significant miner support, BIP148 will be dead almost immediately, making it hard to even call it a split. Yet, BIP148 requires no consensus at all, rather on overwhelming consensus. Thus it violates the community guidlines and constitutes a mallicious attack on Bitcoin, attempting to change the protocol without consensus, by just enforcing rules on less than a dozen key economic nodes, theoretically requiring no support from users or miners, yet with no miners, it is obviously boned.

Why would the insecure and easily attacked chain be more valuable? Simply because it has SegWit? Litecoin has SegWit and a working Lightening Network right now! 
I think that assumptions of immediate value are just wishful thinking. The reason Bitcoin remains much more valuable than Litecoin is because it is much more secure, thanks to much more hashing power behind it.
While most people support SegWit with overwhelming consensus, that doesn't mean people support SegWit 'any way -- any how'. Delays suck, but consensus is meant to be hard.

Lots of people are lying about who supports BIP148. They frequently pretend that if you have an up-to-date core Bitcoin wallet, that you support BIP148, by virtue of your wallet having SegWit code in it, even though your wallet would never allow SegWit without miner consensus.
I suspect there is a small, but very loud, group of people propagandizing support for UASF and a small handful of lemmings following them. Memes, free hats, propaganda, and canvassing are not the signs of organic support. 
BIP148 will never work without significant miner support anyways, that is just not how Bitcoin and consensus works. If it were successful without significant miner support, it would be a sign of a major flaw in Bitcoin's decentralized security. As BIP148 does not require overwhelming consensus to implement protocol changes, it's promotion is against the Community guidelines and its actions are a thwarting of Bitcoin's security.

Those 80% of the network nodes are deployed without implying trust or support in SegWit. They required an overwhelming consensus from miners to activate that code, which is where the trust and support is found, not by running nodes with that possible support.

They are trying to manipulated what the definition of 'signalling' is. Many biased people want SegWit2x signalling to mean less than BIP148, SegWit, or any other signaling. Signaling is just that, a raised hand. It doesn't require any software, enforcement of rules, or even ability to enforce rules. It is just flipping a bit.

They are both the same soft fork to the same SegWit. Just because SegWit2x wants to later hard fork to 2x, like miners agreed to in Hong Kong a year ago with Core's blessing, and like the majority of Core agreed to in the official scaling road map 1.5 years ago, doesn't some how make it the Federal Reserve. That is a pretty silly notion. 
Personally, while I would have supported 2x two years ago, doing 2x after SegWit seems questionable from what I understand of SegWit technical side. Yet, Core did decided doing so would still be good and made it part of the official scaling road map. So miners, core, and everyone has already agreed to this 1+ years ago. Then core never coded it. Instead, they tried to push SegWit without 2x and was rejected by consensus, possibly for fear of reneging on the rest of the deal. Now miners are forced to code it themselves to bypass the blocking of scaling.

2x HF is in Core's scaling roadmap. That isn't miner's sole decision. Also, of course correlation does not equal causation. Many factors effected the price, mostly regulation and freezing of Chinese exchanges at that time.
@_date: 2017-06-25 14:37:43
SegWit2x is the same SegWit. If SegWit2X doesn't block covert ASICBoost, then neither does UASF BIP148. Litecoin is not vulnerable to ASICBoost, yet they get empty blocks too. Mining empty blocks is just another trick to selfishly mine. Empty blocks are not only from ASICBoost. It is doubtful that any really are ASICBoost. Most empty blocks are probably just the empty block trick for mining.
@_date: 2017-06-28 20:57:32
Non one is idolizing anyone, just being realistic. People have blamed the lack of scaling on miners, but as you say, they don't have a say in development.

Interesting. I can't see keeping the block size small being a reasonable way to combat mining to non-full nodes in the long run. It would only reduce the edge it seems, but it would seem logical that any edge possible would be utilized. It seems a way to incentivize using a full node or de-incentivize mining to a non-full node would be ideal. Easier said then done though.

So SegWit, BU, or XT. What shit options. You know no one read the rest of that "other" option. How many people will choose SegWit over a giant douche and a Turd Sandwich?

I agree. Consumer protection should be found at the edge. Then one could choose the edge exchange with the level of consumer protection versus fees and other barriers that they are comfortable with. This is already how Bitcoin is working. One exchange may be super reliable, but have stiff requirements for identification, the correct type of bank account,  confirmation delays, etc, and the other may be trust based and not even require your name which can make a transaction in the same hour. Bitcoin users have the choice.
@_date: 2017-06-21 19:36:02

You can buy 1 gram gold bars in a credit card like holder for around $50 ([Ebay has them all day]( The card acts as the certification. They fit in your wallet just fine and are very handy and usable. Right now a gram is only worth about $42, but without buying bulk, you probably can't beat the Ebay price for such small amounts when factoring in shipping and many times, forced tracking or insurance (who cares for $50, save $12 and skip insurance).
They should have taken this idea, and scaled it down. Make it like a $120 card with 6 pieces at $20 a piece.

Yes, equating it to block size changes is misleading. The size doesn't change, we can just fit more transactions in the same space due to the efficiency gains. Effectively equating a 1MB block size to a 1.7 MB block size with SegWit's transaction and hashing changes was based on the average transaction. We won't see those change, so saying "we see today", doesn't really mean anything. It is really that transactions comes in all shapes and sizes and if the most common kind were to become SegWit transactions, then we would fit the equivalent of the same amount that would fit in 1.7MB without SegWit, into our tiny 1MB blocks. Maybe one could change what they see as the most common transaction and stretch to say 2MB worth of transactions will fit.

That was a really interesting read. It seems the answer is they do need to run a full node.

Not even contemplating another scaling solutions was a sudden blocking of all progress, not the miners' rejection of SegWit.

UASF is an attack on Bitcoin in an attempt to change the protocol without overwhelming consensus. A miner attack against those malicious actors would be in the best interest in Bitcoin. If UASF is successful, then it will prove Bitcoin's decentralized security a failure. 
Any government or bad actor could just mimic UASF's hack of Bitcoin's decentralization, by coercing a couple key economic members into making protocol changes against the wishes of miners and the community.
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:04:27
If only 20% of miners jump on the BIP148 altcoin fork, it will be a very insecure fork that is in constant danger of being attacked. Using it will be very risky and Bitcoin chain miners would be in Bitcoin's best interest to crush the altcoin. No protocol changes should be made without overwhelming consensus, unlike what like BIP148 does, and if it were to be successful, it would prove Bitcoin's decentralized security a failure. It would show that a government or bad actor could take control of Bitcoin and force protocol changes by influencing, even simply tricking, a few key economic members.

BashCo made no technical point, I did. You can't just get on with some alt account and declares yourself a winner when you made no argument. Very lame dude.
Running wallet software that requires miner consensus for SegWit activation does not imply you support SegWit without miner consensus. That is a dirty misleading lie.

Bitcoin needing more regulatory control equates more middle men dipping their hands in the public cookie jar.
This country has been endlessly robbed by the banking industry, with the help of the US government. 
Innovation will find a way to lock the government's corrupt hands out.

Seems like this could be helpful for others if you mentioned what method you got them from and a little bit about the process.

So what would they suggest other than the USD? Maybe we are implying Bitcoin as an alternative.

I don't know if I agree that it is even possible. They could make it difficult by heavily blocking and filtering Internet connections and cracking down on exchanges. I don't think they could stop it if they wanted to at this point.

I don't see what you are getting at. I thought you was implying that credit cards cannot be hacked if you use them at real stores. Target was hacked and now data of up to 40 million credit/debit cards have been compromised even if they've never been used online.

"Deflationary currency is bad, mmmm K"
But we see what inflationary currency does. It provides incentives for excessive borrowing. Barrow now, because the value will just decrease, causing you to pay back less.Then all the big companies barrow as much as they can and then the government has to prop them up. It is a the inflationary borrowing pyramid scheme that is the USD.

I agree hash power is security. I recently read this about Feather coins' attempt to mitigate this some risks with [Advanced Checkpointing.]( Apparently, making it a decentralized feature is still a future goal, but it is interesting that there may be ways to remove some of these risks.

Having a history indiscriminately freezing accounts for idealogical reasons leads me to agree on the PayPal note. When credit cards come into play, I'm not really seeing it though. Sure, someone could charge back. I don't see that stopping the various gold exchanges from accepting credit cards without a waiting period. How is that not in practice? Shipping me a valuable item seems the same as transferring a valuable Bitcoin transaction to my wallet, to me. If I charged back my credit card, I'm not sure what the gold exchange would do, but they provide that payment method anyways. They could tell me to mail the gold back, just as the Bitcoin seller could tell me to transfer the Bitcoins back. I don't see where this diverges from being the same. If this is the same, then why is the same risk different? Is this just a bias of lack of trust in Bitcoin in general, or is there a real difference?

What a dirty underhanded jab.

Cool. I've been trying to find a way to buy some with a credit card or debit card for quite some time with, no luck. This has made me curious to what others are doing. I think I'm stuck either opening a bank account or manually making a transfer with localbitcoins.

I think having a limited supply implies it is deflationary by design (although that is frequently argued against), but then it is compensated with these adjustments, such as block reward and fee rules. As we mine the last coin (100+ years) and start losing more and more coins (already happening), the value of each coin will go up causing deflation. This seems a great situation for saving in the long run.

Why is the community so dismissive and sometimes downright mean about the lacking ability to purchase Bitcoins with a credit card or PayPal?
It seems many times that this lacking area is swept under the rug. Many seem quick to try to guilt you for attempting to buy Bitcoins with a credit card, assuming some interest in scamming or obtaining a loan. 
One common argument I hear is that, since you could do a charge back there is too much risk. This argument seems flawed to me as normally the seller takes all risks and every industry seems perfectly happy to take this risk. My counter is that you can easily buy gold with a credit card and no one cries about the risk, so why should Bitcoin sellers? Obviously this risk would make more sense to take for an established exchange than an individual Bitcoin seller.
Currently, it seems this is a bar making adoption of Bitcoins difficult. To obtain Bitcoins one must verify trust in an established service, then verify trust in one of that service's sellers, then hustle a payment to the seller and hope you get Bitcoins in return. This may require depositing money on someone's account, mailing them money or a money order, or meeting them in person. 
It seems that obtaining Bitcoins require a hustle that isn't worth it for general use.
I'm hoping there is a better way. [Currently I am attempting to use btcquick.com]( but the verification process has turned out to be nothing but quick for someone without a cell phone.
Edit: On a side note, why doesn't r/Bitcoin or r/BitcoinBeginners have a list of reputable exchanges and some FAQs about them on the side bar? That would seem pretty helpful.

This would literally take a handful people (5+), working for a minimum of a month, but more likely 3 or 4 months, just to get into the testing, tweaking, and promoting phase. There would be a server to setup, graphics to make, website, logo, and brand designing. The code would require someone familiar with Qt C++ to work with. Picking reasonable coin attributes would take something near an expert in coin crypto, as you can't just pick random values and think your coin will last. You may need to code some custom features, which could add months to the project. Then you'd use a test blockchain and be in testing for one to three months. You'd need a good bit of equipment mining for this time so you could profile that everything was working correctly, that the coin attributes are preforming as desired. Then you can start the coin. 
So a minimum of 4-6 months, with probably 5 to 20 very talented full time people for this duration.
So to make a decent coin, you probably need about $150,000 in bargain labor from very talented people to get this project off in 6 months.
Just my wild guesses.

Centralized banking is evil organized theft. Bitcoin seems the cure to evil to me. Sucks if you are a rich greedy fuck who enjoys profiting off the back of the poor, as you free ride is in jeopardy.

If they are smart, and they could buy a dungeon full of smart people, they would care now, because this financial revolution would be impossible to stop later.

Ouch, yeah that is a pretty long time. So it would be waiting out the credit card charge's challenge period.

Framing. "Too big" holds a specific negative connotation. Bitcoins are infeasible to derail, not 'too big'.
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:11:35
Everyone bitches about this and it generally gets ignored. I spent like a month trying to find a way to purchase BTC with a credit card, yet again. I had thought the environment had matured and the ridiculous illogical excuse of charge-backs by morons had faded away. I was wrong. In the end the only thing that ever works is cash person to person or mail exchange. If the Bitcoin community would just be more up front about this many many people would not turn away in disgust as I did like 10 times over the last 2 years.

Why does a trading site have so many problems with missing balances? That seems a huge red flag in its self. You are saying, be more patient and understanding of asshole remarks by the support team, when the trading service does the one thing it should never do, fucks up your ballance.

The options are endless. This post would be helpful to others if you posted how you bought the coins and your experience doing so.

They could buy up all the Bitcoins anytime, why hurry. That seems like a crappy way to tackle Bitcoins if they saw them as a threat. The easy way would be to publish FUD and pay IT security and market analyzers for more FUD ammo.
