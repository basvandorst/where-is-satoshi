I've worked in the automotive field for over ten years...that kind of thing happens all the time and i dont live in a tipping society.
It's how things get done.
I don't think o.p is a rich asshole for having a boat...its much less common now as houses/apartments and stupidly expensive where i live but 10-20 years ago many people with a profession owned boats.

As others have said it's a really really common way of getting things done.

What kind of crappy banks are you guys using?
Im just with a run of the mill 'big 4' bank in Australia.
No monthly fees
No atm fees other than from 3rd party non bank machines you find in clubs and stadiums.
No fees to transfer money.
Pathetic interest rate. Like 0.05 or lower
 The 'high rate' saver is only 2ish percent. Requires a 200 dollar monthly deposit and no withdrawals...but thats not an everyday savings account so unfair comparison.

How'd you do that at 21?
I've house shared as rent in my city is almost critically unaffordable. I personally wouldn't do it again unless i absolutely had to. My random internet stranger advice would be to rent the whole place out and live somewhere else.

Im 32 and work 6 days a week usually 50 or so hours i Earn more than an average income and get hit with tax on that. Have paid rent since i was 17.
Average income is like 75k a year where i live. An average house is 500k to a million.
So drop thee condescending tone. You could have worked 24 hours a day and still not earned enough to buy a house outright anywhere near any employment opportunities in my state by the age of 21.
I was hoping your story would be something cool like you put 1000 bucks on bitcoin 5 years ago then cashed it out in January this year.
