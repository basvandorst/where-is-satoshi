Libertarianism is a left wing ideology, the ideology in America could more appropriately be termed right-libertarianism or classical liberalism.

Checking that out, thanks

I never said classical liberalism was left-wing, but libertarianism is. Classical liberalism is definitely more right wing in a modern sense than anything. Right-libertarianism as it exists in current day America is a pretty recent emergence.

Does that site even have any uptime these days? I've been looking around for stable exchanges I can use from Sweden and both GDAX and Kraken have been completely unusable every time I've tried to sign up.

There's a sort of irony to the statement in that libertarianism is originally and historically a leftist ideology (libertarian socialism) whereas "liberal" by and large describes capitalists. The terminology kind of makes a double-think in colloquial American use when you think about it, taking the original libertarian notion of "where hierarchy exists, liberty can not" and reworking it into "having a ruling class is bad, unless they get that way by getting rich in the market"

A nerve has been hit, folks

You're saying this on a subreddit that links to r/anarcho capitalism. Doubt many of the neo-feudalists care if the world is ruled by a cabal of all powerful kings as long as the government isn't regulating them.
