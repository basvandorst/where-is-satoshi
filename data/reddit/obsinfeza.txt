The return you should hope for is 1btc will still be 1btc in the future. The point of bitcoin is it cannot be inflated so comparing it to the thing that can be is not important because what is 5-10k USD going to be worth in the future? Not what it is now, that's for sure. 21million forever and always.

Don't we want it to go up? Network Security goes up with more energy used.
 
It's up to us to create energy using renewable methods. Trade renewable energy surplus into mining power.

We're a specialty import store

We have a lot of products that you can't find here that people see on TV and want to try it. We also have a lot of groceries which can be used for ingredients as it's either not available in Australia or the quality is not as good.

You kinda answered your own question. 
The fact that Libra requires permission to exist is the entire point of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is a permissionless network and you can't stop it from existing now that it has been discovered. Libra can never be any of these.

Exactly the thought I had the other day. What happens when businesses start accumulating bitcoin? Our business has.... only time before others do as well.   
  
What's the point of having a stock market when you can trade in satoshis and store value in satoshis. I'm starting to see no reason to own stocks in centralised companies when perhaps one day they'll all own and want to own more bitcoin.

Just like accepting foreign currency for payment. Report AUD value of the time of transaction.

I was like yeah i know all about bitcoin....  
Then it really clicked and I had an oh shit moment... now i learn something new every day about it. I'm hooked on learning but there's so much to learn and touch up on I love it.  
We have no idea what we have done but it's definitely the biggest thing to happen in our life time for sure.

Bitcoin invoice and we keep the Bitcoin

There's more value for us to hold and use bitcoin, maybe not today but we are preparing for the furure now.
Hopefully our suppliers start to accept Bitcoin so we don't have to deal with horrible exchange rates and high fees and transaction times.
Also chargebacks. I hate it when we ship a parcel and the bank says nope you lose the product and the money because it was fraud.

Less than 5, but that was 1 year in Sydney store only. Now we'll see for online and Melbourne with the launch of our new store

It's not about having a full bitcoin. Just worry about stacking sats. The supply won't change

The dream is it the exchange rate doesn't matter because inflatable Monopoly money is garbage.
I stopped associating Bitcoin to Dollar years ago because I've made my choice as Bitcoin to be *my* primary currency because I believe it to be superior in every way I can think of. 
All I care about now is how many satoshis can get... Kind of like a never ending game where you keep trying to get a high score ��

Store your primary funds on a cold wallet on a computer disconnected from the internet or a hardware wallet. Then use mobile wallet like samurai, brd, etc where you control the keys for daily use. Treat it like cash in your wallet. It's safe but there is still more risk.
Apps like Coinbase where you have to give personal information or not write down 12 or 24 words for back up do not use. You don't actually own your coins in that case.
Remember: not your keys not your coins.

Til it stays the same because there's 21m only and the Monopoly money value actually doesn't matter

We're accepting Bitcoin at our store in Sydney, very rare to see transactions but there are a few. Some very excited to see, most still have no idea what it is or just pay by card.
