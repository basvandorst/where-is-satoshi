Can you cash out using dollars on BTCC?  If not, you would have to hold RMB and convert it to dollars and I don't think you would make a profit.

The coins were clearly sent to a tumbler, I really doubt it.  I think they are lying to keep confidence so people continue to donate.  Maybe it's just bad comms though.
Another thought is that Vaultoro is communicating with the hacker and not Ulbricht.

Why would it?  This is all driven by China /s

I don't trust coinfirm but I'll accept the coinbase explanation.

The problem with the video is someone can steal the video, rehost it and put their own address\QR code in it and steal that way.  Think about it, someone watches the video and sees her face and then a QR code for the donation pops up afterwards.
  
A signed message and tweet confirming it like suggested is probably best.  Not much someone can do with that.

Is BTCC older than BTC-e?

That my friend looks like a chart.
@_date: 2017-01-05 00:12:19
There is zero guarantee there will be a "burst".  Could be no correction or a bunch of small corrections over time which would be preferable.  Anything can happen.
@_date: 2017-01-06 22:01:29
"seems".  Maybe you could try asking google for the free ross bitcoin address and do some homework.  I made my points, anyone who actually cares will go investigate for themselves.

I have been watching this place pretty closely and there are way more people telling it like it is than those pumping big numbers.  If people ignore the sane posts and latch onto the big numbers, that's their fault, we warned them.

Just hold it for them, you have 8 years before they need it.  A lot can change.  Revisit this in 8 years and the ecosystem should be way more mature.

You likely got phished.  Did you have to log in to submit a ticket when you clicked the link?  If so, it was likely a fake hashnet site that stole your credentials and then used them on the real site to steal your money.

Don't accuse me of spreading FUD when you haven't even looked at the transactions.  Do your due diligence.

That's true but all we can do is question and do our best.

There is zero evidence that the sell-off was because of the news.  The news may have just been cover for whales doing something they were planning to do the whole time.
  
That being said, neither the news nor the sell off broke bitcoin.

I've been using Coinbase for 4 years now and never had a problem.  I've read that if you contact them, they will honor the price you were trying to buy at.  Expect delays from support because they are getting hammered right now.

Lyn really needs to confirm she is in control of the address before I'm going to donate.

As someone who does support for a different company, it is really going to depend on your problem.  Problems that require a higher level of access to the back-end data is probably going to go to a smaller trusted team of people while other issues might be dealt with by the first line of support.
  
I've used their support for minor issues and always gotten same day response but this was not during bull market runs.

It's basically magic to 99.9% of the population.

I think I am and Coinbase has been getting hammered during this bull run.  If you don't have it by tomorrow, then I would submit a ticket.

I've been reading articles about how real estate is not in a bubble.  When they are trying to convince us that it isn't a bubble, it's a bubble and it's going to correct.  You also have to consider that Trump is our president and his family can do very well if there is a crisis, even a manufactured one.  We all know they are corrupt as fuck.
  
I think there is a good chance real estate could go down after he buys the house.  Bitcoin could also go down.  Both are a gamble but real estate has more history and has proven to be a solid investment over time.
  
I personally would give it a year or so to see how things go and wouldn't make any moves right now. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 23:14:01
I would quit at 10k but I doubt I would "retire".  I would take a well deserved multi-year break.  I'm in my 40s and I've worked full-time since I was a teenager.  I need this.
@_date: 2017-01-04 23:42:44
I would never import a key directly to a 3rd party site.  I recommend using  offline to decrypt your key and then import the decrypted key into core.  Once done, take her online and then send to your preferred exchange.

Mine seems to have completely forgotten my credentials and now wants me to sign in.  I haven't had to do that for years.

It's just FUD because some assholes decided to short and the price went up on them.  Delays happen and there isn't a single proven case of Coinbase being hacked or stealing peoples money.  They have over 3 million verified users.
@_date: 2017-01-05 21:44:52
Do you need the money?  If yes, sell everything and do not come back until you don't need the money.  If no, go take your medication and spend some time learning about what you have bought.

I don't don't fucking care how hard working someone is.  If their story doesn't make sense then I'm going to say something.
  
Can you explain why the coins moved on the 30th were tumbled?  If not, then shut the fuck up with your righteous bullshit.
  
@_date: 2017-01-05 21:35:07
As the supply dries up, it will take less and less coins to move the market.  Those trades wouldn't have had the same impact 3 years ago.  For the hodlers this is wonderful to see.

Blockchain.info allows you to create a wallet that watches addresses that you don't own.  So you can make it look like you have a lot of money when you don't.  This was a popular scam a few years ago.

Lots of doublespeak there.  We saw the money move, they admit they were hacked yet they say the hackers didn't get the bitcoin.  I'm calling bullshit.
@_date: 2017-01-05 20:47:27
- Probably a watch only wallet pointed at an exchange address
  
- Probably a scammer
  
No one knows what the price will be and anyone who tells you what it will be and cant back it up with data is full of shit.
