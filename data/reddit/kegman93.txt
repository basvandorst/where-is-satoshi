Not to be fucked up but I smoke weed and baccy and the thought has crossed my mind that maybe one day if hopefully not me or anyone for that matter gets cancer. What if I'm able to get the best treatment with one litecoin or some Shit. Just gives me hope knowing the rich get to live longer in some cases.

All I’m tryna say is it’s a good idea and I’m not too knowledgeable on everything crypto. But in my opinion they are creating something more useful and exciting than most other crypto’s right now.

Aight see this is where we differ you are all technical and what not while I’m just coming in hot being like “woah Coinbase sells a penny crypto. Woah that penny crypto has an app I can download on iPhone. That’s kind of cool I haven’t been able to use anything crypto related besides wasting money on those damn crypto kitties”
