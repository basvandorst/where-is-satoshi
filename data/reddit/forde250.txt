There is obviously demand for 2x leveraged bets from people too afraid of the futures market. I think that’s all it is. Or maybe NYSE is throwing everything and see what  sticks

Hey I have a question for you. It seems like the price is more being suppressed than it is being propped up. In the above scenario, would you say it is more likely whales are prepared for a price jump rather than a fall?

One way for the government to kill BTC is to suppress the price for so long that interest dies. I think there’s a (small) chance that could be what’s happening. The price has been oscillating for a month now. 
I’ve watched btc price for years and this is a little unusual for the price to move and be caged in like this..

I'd say it is pretty likely Peter Thiel is or considering helping to fund lightning network development. I mean he funded Hulk Hogans lawsuit against Gawker for his own personal agenda for goodness sake. This would be a great idea for him. From what I read, he (or his Founders Fund) dislikes altcoins and considers them useless and this would kill 2 birds with 1 stone. ( I hope he reads this )

That’s the first thought I had too. I know pretty much everyone on this sub is sick of seeing the price slowly climb up just to drop like a rock and repeating every couple weeks. And then getting yelled at for crying “manipulation”. It’s pretty obvious it’s happening and naive to think it’s not. If it one thing I learned in life. It’s that people will do absolutely anything in the name of money.

Good for boitcons
@_date: 2019-03-13 17:46:22
It’s the “huge fucking miners” that will accelerate cheap renewable energy. Because they’re huge fucking miners. They will build the renewable infrastructure in order to mine more bitcoin. Especially in a bull market,  there no limit to what greed will do. People will do a lot things for money, as opposed to save the environment. I was using an individual buying a solar panel as an example on the smallest scale. You got so worked up you proved my point.
@_date: 2019-03-13 08:34:30
I always wonder about this. Why doesn’t the media talk about the obvious fact that if bitcoin sees mass adoption, it will also accelerate the mass adoption of cheap renewal energy? All I see is articles about how bitcoin destroys the environment when maybe it might be the thing that saves us.
@_date: 2019-11-07 06:38:45

Some argue a tether dropping to 0 is a drop in the bucket of crypto. Positive news of developments in bitcoin are getting buried. Maybe the current price drop is caused by the expectation of a tether implosion. Meaning if the rumors are proven true, it could be followed by a strong rebound. Sell the rumor buy the news.

Does anyone agree, with this much scrutiny on the tether situation.. everyone pretty much agrees they are guilty. Wouldn’t it’s insolvency be priced in already??? Or at least partially?

Altcoins are pretty much testnets for bitcoin. BTC will pick and choose which features to take

Unfortunately, this is not reflected in the price. People want to speculate on the next 100x “coin” before understanding what’s in front of them.

So I guess big corp and whales were not happy about trump rolling back Dodd frank regulations?

At this point I’m hoping for regulation before these mega whales start manipulating the shit out of us peasants.

My guess has always been that he is so book smart and has so many degrees that he believes he should have invented something revolutionary like bitcoin. When he heard about it he decided to just claim he invented it.
