Why no one is talking about how much electricity banks use by: employees travelling to work, buildings maintained and the end result is still shitty transaction service and wasting lifes of everyone involved.

I'll get some popcorn for this, sounds very interesting. It is about time someone show practical security problems with small forked networks - exchanges should be very cautious on this.

The best presentation in that conference was by far from Nic Carter. Thanks for sharing your research and building an amazing analytics tool.

Amazing use case which helps regular people and gives them back the freedom to transact. Imagine what will happen during the recession in some other highly inflationary countries such as: Congo, Mozambique, Zambia, Ghana, Nigeria. They are next to adopt cryptocurrencies(most likely BTC) out of pure necessity.

They are one of the worst and most scammy exchanges. I have seen them doing pumps for coins, which had their blockchains dead for months.

Funny that they copied Dash'es whitepaper. Great way to create more Digital trash.

For this kind of content everyone should just go to r/btc

This is very true, when dollar loses its status as world's reserve currency, US ability to fund itself will collapse and they have a lot of operations going on, which need funding. Ray Dalio started recently talking about this: [

Probably yes, every downturn ends up with lower volatility than it was before the crash and during past 9 months some significant infrastructure has been built for the cryptocurrency market + institutional fomo should kick in next year.

The only connection between Buterin and Kim Jong Un i can think of, is that Kim has been stealing food from the guy.

It is known, that Bitmain, holds 0.85 million BCH, and it is also known that since the fork 1.05 million of BCH was moved, everything else remains untouched and is likely to be ignored forever. This means that \~85% of the total BCH circulating supply is controlled by a single company which can not liquidate it and can suck up the loss, source: [
I am fairly new to reddit, so when i posted these facts on r/btc got some pretty negative karma, just to find out that its the Bitcoin trash subreddit. Did not realize, that they even hire people to do the brainwashing.

Warren is not that bad to have by mistake, but that car salesman RV - dissapointing

Thanks. This is a broad representation of taxes mostly for individuals. Corporate law may be different and even if you find a loophole you will have a hard time opening a bank account. Banks are the bottleneck for getting fiat, they are as useless as it gets.

Last year we had 3 months delay on our withdrawal from Crypto capital, if they are using the same company now, it is not that strange because their banking is shady. Not choosing any side, but i remeber that Bitfinex survived way worse than this.

There are some pretty brave or extremely stupid people letting the bot to manage such amounts without fail-safe mechanisms. A random API error or a glitch can cause such breakouts, why would anyone want to stop such trading - it's a cash grab for all the smart bots who are doing arbitrage.

Full disclosure:
I am the owner of this exchange. Kaiserex AI is far from a holy grail or an AI which could tell the future. It has made many mistakes before and is guaranteed to make them in the future. Therefore we use these signals with a statistical approach, meaning that we try to win in the long term many times over and do not over-bet on an individual signal. In our opinion signals we get from the Kaiserex AI are more reliable than technical analysis, because they include fundamental data outside of the charts and price action.
However when the market is being manipulated with buy walls, spoof trading, or other similar methods, all fundamental information and technical analysis might get discounted and AI ability to predict disappears.

From my very subjective and unmeasured understanding during last 3 months market was manipulated for about 15 to 30% of the time. Even the manipulator has to go by the rules and they have to pick the right moment to do it or they will lose money. 
Usually the most obvious manipulations are predicted by the AI as well, because the fundamental indicators give it away, such as movement of cryptocurrency in/out of exchange wallets or printing of new stablecoins.

Thanks for the great feedback. I will try to keep this article updated once every month or so.
