If it was the 1930's depression again and industrial production was down 50% should the government influence the money supply?

Interesting that one of your 3 Reddit comments was almost exactly the same comment about Litecoin as I made about Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-10-05 01:28:41
Although I disagree with you good to see differing opinions

The lower the price goes the dumber the pool of bagholders left, so the dumber the excuses that pass as being acceptable to keep holding the butt bag
@_date: 2014-10-05 08:00:03
Shouldn't need to be bracing the butts been a flow of dumping

Saying there is no merit in monetary policy and supporting Bitcoin just makes Bitcoin look bad

The price is based on speculative cult based hype and not backed by utility or demand. It was fashionable to wear the trendy Bitcoin tshirt. Thats over and the tshirt is now going to the thrift shop but that is ok because it will still always have some hipster value in the future.

You can get them fast or cheap butt not both
@_date: 2014-10-05 03:27:05
$260 in 2014 and $120 in 2015
edit: then $80 later in 2015

The hype is over. Bitcoin needs to prove itself as a valid competitor to fiat now to gain value. If it does that the price will come, otherwise it will continue to shift downwards. There are a lot of political factors to consider as well as pure technology. I think gaining traction in unbanked populations is the key for Bitcoin

I have that is why I'm here
@_date: 2014-09-23 14:58:58
Uh Yeah. Ok the Bitcoin takeup is on pace with the web in the late 1990's 
@_date: 2014-10-05 07:49:59
Don't worry you will have plenty more paydays with the price below $350
@_date: 2014-10-05 09:03:23
Look good:)

You guys shill to pump up the price of your investment and interests. Bitcoin haters who are short do the opposite. I'm here for EXACTLY the same reason as you buddy
@_date: 2014-10-05 11:48:02
The beer will be long gone by then
@_date: 2014-10-12 16:25:38
Laws can be introduced to make Bitcoin use more and more difficult or even banned like some countries

I wasn't trying to call you stupid. The claim you are making however is to dismiss the worlds foremost economists. You are also saying the smoothening of the economic cycle has no benefit.
@_date: 2014-10-05 12:29:37
 &gt;for me it is totally impossible to use a currency that drops 5% in one night.
are you a buttcoiner?
