It seems nothing connected with cryptocurrency is. I joined several subs with the hope of just getting an ear to the ground of each currencies development. Instead I have many, loud voices telling me that their crypto is the one true crypto.

Are you insane? Only? Expertise and capital are the toughest things to get a hold of, and even if he had then, the doesn't have marketshare or  the ability to actually compete with them. They would just crush him.

Hell no, but saying she's as bad as Trump is absurd.

Wouldn't this be dependent on the processing power of the mining machines? Or is truly a controlled supply where they just want release any new ones regardless of how much mining is going on?

I hope not, selling someone something that doesn't exist is fraud.

I know that sounds like a cheeky answer, but seriously, everything. Like I said, I don't like Hillary, primarily because I don't believe she is in politics for the right reasons, nor do I believe she is honest or genuine in her beliefs and policies. Her policies tend to reflect what is politically expedient and attractive, rather than any ideology or philosophy she believes in. 
But even Hillary's worst traits and tendencies, Trump has markedly worse. Petulant and proud of it. Boastful, vain and domineering. Ill tempered and vengeful, incapable of turning the other cheek or even simply focusing on what matters. He flip flops worse than Hillary, as evidenced by the health care repeal effort and more recently, the parkland school shooting where he advocated taking people's guns without warrants or justification.
Hillary is power hungry sure, but she does seems to have modicum of interest in the common man's well being. Trump is purely power hungry, simply using the rhetoric of populism to gain more power and support, his policies damning and ruining the very people he claims to support and whom elected him.
This could seriously go on for pages and pages, so I'm gonna cut it off there. Just know that I could easily keep going.
