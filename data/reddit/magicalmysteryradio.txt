Enlighten me on Stellar vs. IOTA. I'm always looking to learn more, and I'll admit, I don't know enough about Stellar.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:54:26
Not HODL'ing I take it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:37:46
Great vid. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:47:22
Ha! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:49:49
They (GDAX/Coinbase) gotta' get their shit together, and fast, otherwise they're gonna lose everyone's trust. 
EDIT: Permanently. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:03:07
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:23:00
We'll know soon enough.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:30:49
Oh, the irony.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:30:26
ELI5 on all these tiny trades on GDAX. Are these bots buying and selling to profit off the small swings in the trade price?
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:18:12
Well, let's see how it plays out over the next couple of years. Should be interesting if nothing else. But you're probably right regarding the tech.

Reminder: Nobody knows anything.

I did, and apparently, it's just a glitch. Once it went through it was for the correct amount. Damn, I thought I was gonna score. ;-)
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:07:26
GDAX having issues again? Getting ready to sell a little ETH, around 1.0, and it says it's worth $2,793! That can't be right. 
EDIT: Trading for SAT it says it's worth 2793.39 BTC! WTF?
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:59:46
Well, it allows me to withdraw Crypto to Paypal, but not USD. Does Paypal then convert that crypto amount to USD? Thanks for your help.

The blockchain is the future of digital currency. Cherry-picking one line to make your point is lazy. And no, it's not the past. It hasn't even reached peak mainstream awareness yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:12:30
Stop it with the FUD. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:35:04
Yup. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:47:04
Maybe, but most people aren't aware of that, hell most people aren't aware of any of this stuff, which is why Bitcoin has a leg up... for the near future. Again, in 5 - 10 years (maybe sooner?) it might go the way of AOL or MySpace, but for now... it's the biggest name in the game. 
BTW, I'm just speaking more from a branding/marketing point of view, rather than just the tech.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:22:05
No. Just fed up with the bullshit. And it's not plummeting. But if it does, I'll just buy more. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:27:35
Everyone just needs to f**king cut it out with the FUD. All anyone needs to know is that this is the future of digital currency. Either get on board or get left behind. And Bitcoin has the branding lead. Once cryptos hit the mainstream, and this is just starting to happen now, Bitcoin will be the name people know and use. Now, in the future (5 - 10 years from now or more) who knows. But for now, it's gonna be Bitcoin, with Ethereum and Litecoin running a close second and third.  IOTA for non-blockchain. That's it.    
This fear-mongering crap needs to stop. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:15:10
Very cool. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:28:55
Once people realize the scam Roger Ver tried to pull with BCH, money will flow back to BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:51:11
On an uptrend...
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:44:27
Exactly. No one who's been following the events of the past 48 hours wants anything to do with BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:50:38
Coinbase is GDAX. And yes, they're losing credibility by the minute.
