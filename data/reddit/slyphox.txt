Why the hell would you ever click on a link or an attachment you weren't expecting from an unknown sender?

Something like iodine?

Somewhat similar situation here. Moved to a new phone and my Authy corrupted and is unable to generate an OTP. Lost access to Kraken, Bitstamp, and local bitcoins. Somehow my coinbase account was still fine. Still waiting to hear back from each on what I need to do.

I already know where I want to put it. :)

My only problem with Authy is I switched to a new device and sold my old phone only to find that the backup was corrupted for almost all of my accounts. :/

Torrents aren't user friendly? Unless you ment something else.

Are you the guy they'd call on Pawn Stars?

With the current difficulty rate, at 333 mh/s they stand to make about $7.50/month. They use to cost around $15 per but with the sudden skyrocket in BTC price, they fetch about $60-$150 so your ROI is going to be pretty lackluster. 
I'd recommend them for learning about mining rather as a means to win big.

I think right now we're still at a stage where your average Bitcoin user is tech savvy enough to figure out torrents or is already familiar with the protocol.

$6-7 is more average for stuff that isnt AMBEV. Most of the time I end up going with liquor because it isnt much more expensive.

.08 BTC is a bit too much for me right now unless that was set when it was $300/BTC. It's a great cause but I've never paid over $50 for a tshirt @_@

Fun fact, that restaurant doesnt accept Bitcoin. I went there thinking I'd be able to perform a real life transaction only to be sadly disappointed.
Apparently, the owner is friends with Tony from BitPay and they are hoping to accept BTC soon.
With that aside, the food and beer was great!

To my knowledge, Mutlibit doesnt have any kind of penalty for password attempts. 
I would keep at it and make it a task to try a few times a day. The reward for your efforts is pretty sizeable so I wouldn't give up hope just yet!

I would love to know if this mythical place that sells beer for $3.64.
