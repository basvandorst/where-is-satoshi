Ahh, so you mean that the code will be written but it won't necessarily be merged into core. Yeah, there are a lot of hurdles to overcome for any HF - this being just one of them. The alternative to not having Core merge the code is lots of strife and eventually a more controversial HF attempt by others, be it classic or some other dev team so that should be enough motivation for the majority to row together.

Winner of the semantics battle sir. :) I'd argue that any hard fork requires people to agree and some majority level of participation of full nodes, miners, etc. Otherwise, hard forkers just are putting themselves on their own island - example, any miner that chooses to ignore the upcoming halving in July is welcome to put out 25 bitcoin blocks forever - they just won't get much of a following.

* Miners are already doing head first mining.
* Miners without fast connectivity and who do not do head first mining are at a disadvantage to those that do head first mining.
* There are no BIPs that are being seriously discussed which prevent head first mining.
Are you asking miners to voluntarily reduce their profits in order to benefit the community as a whole? That seems irrational, as opposed to Gavin's response which is to write software which reduces the current risk that validationless mining introduced.

Thanks to some fancy crypto, anyone can anchor any number of files, of any size (even whole databases) *at a cost of zero.* Bitcoin miners don’t need to run new software, and users don’t even need to send their data anywhere.
Uhh, really? Because miners have free bandwidth, free CPU power and free storage for running an unlimited number of unlimited size blockchains via merged mining? Merged mining certainly has costs and certainly has scalability limits.

As I understand it, much of the mining in China is done through power arrangements that simply are less available in other parts of the world. Example: China has remote hydro power plants that generate excess electricity and which cannot be utilized. An official in charge of such a plant would look kindly upon any opportunity to gain extra income from selling this otherwise unused power to a local/on-site miner. In this manner, the price per kw/h could be as little as $0.01 per kw/h since any contract there is no marginal cost to the power producer.
I'm not in China and I can't verify that this type of arrangement exists but it makes sense. It's hard to compete with someone who's operating costs are near zero (internet service and some minimal upkeep/maintenance).
@_date: 2016-03-17 12:24:45
This isn't validationless mining. It's head-first mining - the block has a valid proof of work and the empty block won't contain any invalid transactions. While the empty block is being created, all miners are validating the transactions in the previous block. The changes gavin suggested won't allow for a long string of empty blocks with a potentially invalid trx in a head-only-validated block to be created.
Also, it still costs miners 1 block reward each and every time they create an invalid block. An attacker trying to intentionally create 3 invalid blocks will need to gain 3 block rewards worth of blocks in order to guarantee that they'll get 3 blocks of transactions to present to an SPV client.
Lastly, would you recommend an SPV client to accept a large BTC payment with less than 6 confirmations? I wouldn't, regardless of what miners are validating or aren't validating.

@_date: 2016-03-17 13:53:33
These are good points, although I still think nothing changes from the user experience whether running a lite or full wallet. I think it's relatively universal and wise advice to always wait for 6 confirmations for meaningful sized transactions - anyone waiting for only 1-3 confirms on a phone and receiving say 3X the block reward is at risk for a number of reasons.
The good news is that mining empty blocks has a diminishing incentive - as the block reward goes down and cumulative fees go up, there's less reason to try to mine an empty block. Unfortunately, this will create orphan pressure as miners will likely mine briefly on the previous block while trying to steal/orphan the recently broadcast block to gain the fee reward.
It should be trivial to make add some logic to not perform header-first mining on empty blocks. This would prevent more than a 2 deep invalid block scenario by non-malicious miners performing head first mining.

I've seen transactions on an an admittedly old version of MultiBit Classic fail due to the default fee and the same for Armory in the past week or so. Armory used 0.00005 which didn't relay to any connected nodes, so the transaction merely failed and could easily be resent. MultiBit Classic used a 0.0001 fee, was relayed and seen on a number of block explorers but wasn't mined after 4-5 days.
Don't rely purely on your wallet for fee selection, especially if it's an older version.

A fully validating node is a fully validating node. There is no "shady" setting. There is no "harm" setting.
Data center hosted nodes do help, not harm. They spread the load for initial block download and provide a greater number of clients for SPV nodes to connect to, reducing the ability for an attacker to sybil them.

| Privacy argument.
* Tor, VPN and adding extra hops are all layers that would need to be peeled back if an adversary wanted to track Bitcoin transaction broadcasts. If my adversary is the FBI or NSA, adding an extra hop at a datacenter isn't worth a lot. If my adversary is merely chainalysis or one of the other dozen blockchain analysis companies, adding an extra hop from a datacenter in another geograph could be enough to obscure identity.
* Actually, SMTP is much more similar to Bitcoin than E-Gold. E-Gold was completely centralized whereas SMTP has global distribution (gmail, outlook.com not withstanding). To date, I'm not aware of a widespread legal attack that has persevered against a particular protocol. While I do grant that it would be possible for new laws to be written to target Bitcoin, today I am aware of no law that would allow the FBI to tell AWS to shutdown all servers running on port 8333. IMO, if running a Bitcoin node becomes illegal then it has a lot more weakpoints for laws to attack than nodes running in datacenters - businesses and exchanges will be the first target.
|Pruning: &lt;snip&gt; It's as if there's a homeless guy in your town, and each day 100 people show up with food, and then you send another 100. Homeless guy can't eat that much yo.
* As someone who ran datacenters for financial services, this is not the right way to think about resource availability. The goal for running a service is to *never* have capacity overloaded where there is more demand than there is availability. If today customers are maxing out 50% of currently available resources on average, it's time to add more since an unexpected peak increase could tax the system.
* Also, I've seen plenty of users post numbers on bandwidth utilization - I see north of 300GB outbound traffic on my nodes. There are a limited number of users that can accommodate those sorts of upstream bandwidth numbers and therefore adding more nodes to more evenly distribute initial block distribution and requests from SPV clients should be a strong net positive.
|SPV nodes: 
* Again, the more quality resources there are available, the better. I never said they should be all run from the same datacenter - they should be spread out. Personally, I run a handful of nodes from home via VPN and from Azure and one other less commonly used datacenter. I think we can agree that running one node only from AWS isn't ideal since that individual paying for it could simply forget to update their credit card or could lose interest. So that end, running 100+ nodes from AWS is probably much better than only running a handful. Running 1000+? Probably not that useful.

@_date: 2016-03-25 16:07:11
Regarding (new) nodes in data centers requesting more traffic, I would break this down into initial block download (IBD) and then p2p message broadcast. IBD is what it is. Every new node needs to download the full blockchain which is around 60GB. Obviously if many new nodes are popping up and then not sticking around or not opening outbound ports, then this is a net drain on the network. We can't really avoid this since there are a number of legit users that will run full nodes at home without choosing to open ports or even being aware that this makes a difference to the rest of the network.
With regard to p2p messaging, it turns out that Bitcoin's gossip network is fairly efficient. For example, my nodes tend to download only about 10-20GB per month vs send 200-400gb upstream. There's some more data from this blogpost that you might find interesting. 
@_date: 2016-03-04 19:50:11

Thus the reason for competing teams. Interestingly enough, I don't think that Blockstream has made a tremendous direct impact in the Bitcoin space. It has enabled some Core developers, mathematicians, engineers, etc to work full time on Bitcoin core development without needing to worry about paying the rent or health insurance which is great for them - otherwise I don't think it has changed the narrative very much.
Ask yourself this - would Greg Maxwell, Matt Corallo, Pieter Wuille or other Blockstreamers make different decisions if they were self-employed or worked for Coinbase? I honestly don't think so - they aren't the type to go along with the flow. They speak their mind, act independently, hardly compromise on anything. That doesn't have anything to do with Blockstream.

But now you're relying upon another server or proxy service to route your traffic through. The proxies can easily limit bandwidth, introduce additional latency, problems with reliability, etc. Setting up the additional services requires some technical skills, possibly some cost and motivation.

@_date: 2016-03-17 01:24:07
Well, no - if there are 3 confirms then it would be payments greater than 3 block rewards since it costs an attacker this much to create 3 invalid blocks in a row. :)
Regardless, it's never been safe to accept large BTC transactions like this with only 1-2 confirms since there could easily be a reorg which double spends away your confirmed transaction. This is true for both mobile wallets and full node wallets.

That would be a big problem actually. Many home internet providers block inbound port 25, 80 and 443 as a policy, without the ability to open the port. 
If ISPs started targeting Bitcoin traffic, end users would have to either increase their costs by paying for a business connection if available or use a VPN service. I'm not saying that Bitcoin wouldn't survive, but that it would definitely cut down on the number of active full nodes run from residential locations.

Miners are very conservative. Should it be the case that miners reach 95% (or even 75%) agreement on a block size, it's not going to happen in a vacuum - they'll be speaking with exchanges and other trading partners before such a change happens. It'll represent a broad agreement within the community, even if there are some vocal disagreements.
Yes, a PoW change is always a possibility for thwarting a malicious miner attack which is not supported by a majority of the community, however, IMO 1M -&gt; 2M blocks would not likely qualify for an emergency PoW reset via hard fork.

Altcoins are useful, just not so much for the user. They're useful as developer testbeds for features that are too experimental to consider including in Bitcoin. Quote from the article:
"Monero is a place to experiment with things that Bitcoin simply can't experiment with right now."
There is also the chance that eventually enough specific services decide it's worth the effort to accept altcoins due to some niche feature. For example, maybe one day Bitcoin trx become too expensive to use for low end retail purchases (Lightning network notwithstanding). In this case, perhaps LTC has a use case.
Eventually there's also the privacy aspect. If there are crackdowns on grey or black markets accepting Bitcoin due to traceability, perhaps there will be a shift to Monero or ZCash or something else. Or maybe Bitcoin will incorporate confidential transactions either on mainnet or as a sidechain. Time will tell and in the meantime at least altcoin communities are enjoying the freedom of not having (as) lengthy arguments about various feature merits.
@_date: 2016-03-03 21:29:01
* "SPV" mining requires the creation of empty blocks since including any trx risks creating a double-spend and an invalid block.
* Unless the miner can validate the 'gigablock' they cannot create a block containing transactions. Creating a long chain of blocks containing zero transactions breaks Bitcoin (users get zero confirmations) and will cause the price the fall.
Thus, either the block is eventually validated or miners will need to give up on this chain and orphan the block and any subsequent blocks. The longer they wait, the more they have to lose.
Back to the original point - BIP109 is a fix for hard to validate blocks and 2MB is hardly a gigablock.

Miners can choose to validationlessly create empty invalid blocks forever which there will be zero rewards, but that would be completely irrational, costly and without any benefit except to attack the network. If you're worried about that, then are you worried about 51% of miners creating empty blocks just to screw with users?
@_date: 2016-03-23 22:43:27
Yes and no. If you're referring to Fanny Mae, Freddie Mac then that only accounted for a small portion of the loans. Most of them were offered by greedy private institutions who made bad loans on their own poor judgement, without any prodding by the gov't.
 “More than 84 percent of the subprime mortgages in 2006 were issued by private lending institutions….Private firms made nearly 83 percent of the subprime loans to low- and moderate-income borrowers that year.”

No, not just with SPV mining. In either case the miner has to validate the block eventually. The miner can either idle their equipment during that time or attempt to mine an empty block. If they have received an invalid block or produce an invalid block, it takes all miners who are not SPV mining or are SPV mining the same amount of time and resources to validate the block regardless.

Uhh, no it certainly does not have to be merged. Example A: Miners are SPV mining today. Every miner doing this is running custom software which Bitcoin Core did not write. Miners may or may not use this regardless of what Core or Blockstream's opinion may be.

Indeed - motivation plays a big part. If there's no urgent reason to upgrade to a new version, people are lazy about it. However, every Bitcoin company and user realistically needs to be prepared to upgrade their software at any given time. Like all software developed by humans, Bitcoin is almost guaranteed to be developed with undiscovered software flaws. Running software forever and never upgrading is not really an option. Heartbleed, shellshock, glibc, etc, etc...
Not paying attention and not upgrading *under certain conditions* is ultimately an act of negligence on the part of the end user.

Such is the nature of compromise. It would have been great if Satoshi had thought to put in a doubling of the limit every 2-4 years, but even geniuses can't think of everything.
At least then the block limit would be more of a pure DDoS tool and miners could operate at whatever soft limits they choose, the way it was for the first 7 years or so...

Isn't that the concern? If the majority of miners treat xyz transaction with a typical fee as spam then that causes a poor experience for the end user who could be intentionally flooding the network or operating in a manner that appears as spam.

In 2010 the 92bn BTC block caused a fork and thus 'downtime': 
@_date: 2016-03-25 22:56:43
Let's try and make this a simpler analysis. Two scenarios:
* 1) 5,000 nodes total with the typical 2015 distribution
* 2) 10,000 nodes total. The same 5,000 nodes above and an additional 5,000 nodes hosted by 3 large service providers, each service provider with multiple data centers in multiple countries controlled by ~1,000 users.
In which scenario is Bitcoin better off? I would argue that it's hands down option 2. Reasons:
* Better protection against DDoS attacks (more targets to attack, data centers handle DDoS attacks better)
* Lower costs for each node operator in terms of bandwidth utilization for IBD (this is a real problem that users have complained about where limited upstream bandwidth interferes with residential bandwidth available)
* Incrementally harder to shut down politically (data centers don't like turning away paying customers; end users who are willing to pay for nodes are more vested)
* Better privacy (the more nodes there are, the harder it is for transaction analysis companies to connect to high percentages of the network)
@_date: 2016-03-03 17:47:13
It deserves a mention, certainly. However, it doesn't automatically mean that because an attack is possible all other scaling must stop.
I believe firmly that the Core and Classic developers are both well meaning, but that there's a fundamental disagreement on the scaling/decentralization/security tradeoffs. There's no wrong/right answer - the market will ultimately decide who's plan is more convincing.
@_date: 2016-03-03 17:25:39
There's also a really good chance that if a poisonous block is created, miners will try to validate it for a few minutes, give up and just orphan it. Can't really see exactly what the big deal would be then.
Also, the point is that BIP 109 has a fix for the poisonous block.

I usually think of Aaron as a relatively independent thinker but this article is completely biased and narrow.
|Conclusion: Operating a Bitcoin node from a data center provides questionable validation if it’s used for transacting, and no meaningful validation whatsoever if it’s not.
* What if I want to relay my transactions to a node I control to help protect my privacy at home? Sure, VPN and Tor are options, but so is relaying through a node I control in the cloud.
|Conclusion: Operating more than one Bitcoin node per data center does not provide any meaningful decentralization.
* Really? When was the last time a datacenter got a request to shut down all of the nodes running Apache? Or SMTP? If nodes are targeted at a datacenter it will likely be on a per account basis, not on a per datacenter basis (unless your node is in Russia, DPRK, Bolivia, etc).
|Conclusion: Operating Bitcoin nodes with blockchain pruning enabled from data centers does not currently provide much useful data to syncing nodes.
* So, operating non-pruning nodes IS useful. What percentage of nodes (either classic or core) are pruned vs full nodes, Aaron? C'mon - that's lazy biased reporting.
|Conclusion: Operating Bitcoin nodes with blockchain pruning enabled from data centers does not currently provide much useful data to SPV nodes.
* Really? The more legitimate full nodes that do not have blockchain pruning enabled, the harder it is to sybil attack SPV nodes.
If anything, the real takeaway I see from this article is to try to diversify as much as possible. Run nodes from AWS, Azure, Choopa and the other several thousand VPS providers available around the world. That helps decentralization, makes it harder to DDoS nodes or isolate  nodes.

Merely because market cap and market dominance are subject to manipulation doesn't make it completely useless. Just like trx per day, avg fees paid, hashrate, node count, price, merchant integration, github commits, google search, coin days destroyed, volume traded, etc, these stats help add to a picture of project health and user interest.
Each and every stat can be gamed and manipulated but there are costs (albeit some very low) to gaming stats. Even if you don't think market dominance shows the entire picture by itself, there's a huge difference between Bitcoin at 90% market dominance in 2016 and 50% market dominance in 2017 which isn't completely explained away by manipulation.

But perhaps the value in something like this is more than just the actual use case - maybe it's a psychological thing where it makes people really believe that Bitcoin survives even in locales with next to no infrastructure. I guess there will be not much way to know if anyone ever uses it, besides anecdotal evidence since satellite streams are read only.

@_date: 2017-08-14 00:53:38


Yeah you could do that but then it wouldn't be added to places like coinmarketcap.com which filter out low volume assets like belcher_trillion_coin. The ~ 75 altcoins making up the other 50% of the crypto market cap all trade for at least 300BTC a day on markets with fees. Gameable, yes, but nowhere near as trivial as your supposed $1 volume trillion coin clone.


Ripple is boring, centralized and worst of all for our discussion purposes, doesn't actually allow for all the assets to trade due to lockups with Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, Chris Larsen and Ripple Labs XRP.
ETH on the other hand is a legitimate crypto asset which trades freely. While you may dismiss it due to the HF rollback or perceived centralization, the market doesn't care and in fact may value ETH for its differences from Bitcoin, not similarities. Also, given enough time it's easy enough to believe that ETH will be supported by fractious enough groups to make a similar HF impossible in the future.
TLDR; I don't think market cap is a completely useless stat.

Use dedicated hardware and safe computing practices first and then worry about OS secondarily. That means keep your keys on a device that doesn't browse the web, use skype, open random files, emails, etc. Better yet, put your keys on a device which has no internet connection at all (Armory,etc). After that, we can debate about Windows, OSX, Linux, FreeBSD, etc.

A fair point but I'd say that if the internet is disrupted for a long period of time it's indicative of a collapse of society as we know it. In that case bullets will be worth more than gold, food or water since violence is a means to obtain or protect scarce necessities. Let's hope we never see that put to the test.
I think that what hurts both the adoption of Bitcoin and gold is laziness. People generally don't want to go out of their way to make payments (in 1st world countries) as they are typically more costly, higher friction and doesn't give provide any benefits. I think that the pool of users willing to buy some Bitcoin and put it on their phone is actually much larger than the pool of users willing to buy some gold coins and keep them in their pocket for spending.
Countries like Venezuela exploding from corruption and mismanagement are prime scenarios for Bitcoin to succeed. Luckily for Bitcoin there doesn't seem to be a shortage of corrupt officials willing to step up to the plate and kill off their local economies for personal gain.

The stock market is volatile, unless you have a time frame of at least 20-25 years during which it has never lost money.
I'll grant that no one should be 100% in stocks but being 100% in gold (which you have not suggested) would also be unwise for any length of time.

Sure - that's possible, although the likelihood of remaining on the gold standard was pretty low given economists/politicians desires to be able to manipulate the money supply in order to influence the economy.

Bitcoin isn't about performing altruistic actions that benefit others - if it relied upon that then the system would fall apart.
Miners mine empty blocks while validating new blocks. The alternative would be for them to turn off their equipment for maybe 10-20 seconds since this would at least save them some power costs. That or they could try to mine the previous block and hope to orphan the current block - neither of these make as much sense as what they are doing today.
If validationless mining of empty blocks when miners are validating the current block is the most profitable way to operate, how would you expect them to do anything else?Want it to be different? Don't ask miners to change their mechanisms - incentivize them to do the 'right' thing.

If Bitcoin is money, then it is designed to be used and accepted by as wide a swath of the general population as possible. Not only that, the end users are expected to participate by selecting software, maintaining the security of their keys and ideally running their own node on their own hardware. All this is part of the original vision and yet some in the community feel that users aren't expected to have opinions or a voice in how their money is scaled?

Now I get it with really unpopular changes - the 21M hard cap, privacy decreasing features, etc. Those are issues where there would be some miners and users that have enough religion about these issues that they will make a good effort at supporting a split.
The proposed HF at stake here is not a big enough deal to get miners to choose the weaker side. No miners, no blocks, end of story.

A better analogy would be if Texas had threatened to drop nuclear weapons and this caused a Japanese surrender. My point is that this UASF didn’t have teeth since it had zero exchange support. It would have fizzled if not for miners agreeing to do the MASF ahead of time.
Perhaps we are ultimately arguing about the same thing since I ultimately believe that a UASF would have occurred if miners had dragged their feet further and miners didn’t want to wait until one came along with more support, making it clear that miners can’t resist coordinated user, exchange and developer efforts.

Personally, with the question of block size, I side with the majority regardless - even that's opposed to what I'd like to see happen. On the question of something more fundamental, such as the 21M limit, I feel strongly enough that I might mine on the minority chain depending upon the circumstances. I imagine that many feel similarly.
Feeling strongly about something enough to argue about it isn't the same as going to battle over it.

Miners are conservative. 75% of blocks marked with larger blocks will ONLY occur when each miner has sufficient confidence that their trading partners (exchanges) and users running full nodes will accept their blocks/transactions.
Fear not - either this HF goes through smoothly or it won't go through at all. You should be far more concerned about an emergency PoW reset HF were that to ever become a necessity.

Generally not a fan of bitledger's articles, however, with this one the general premise seems solid.
The Bitcoin network participants are going to do whatever is in their best interest. It makes very little difference what miners or developers think - if there is to be a hard fork, it will happen. If not, no amount of 'pushing' by any one group will make it happen.
I think that the wildcard here is what happens in the back half of 2016 when blocks are even fuller and fees start to climb. Will SW be adopted quickly enough to reduce the pressure? I'm not certain.
@_date: 2016-02-11 23:38:29
I don't believe that the original client will be able to validate the chain throughout - didn't Satoshi make a hard fork unilaterally in 2010?
Regardless, the foundation that Satoshi built bitcoin is indeed on consensus. However, the whitepaper says nothing about minority rule being allowed to veto changes. I don't see this as a coup at all - bitcoin always follows the Longest Majority Accepted Chain, soft or hard forks included.

80% of hashing power just agreed to not switch to Classic only based on a compromise including a HF block size increase with firm timeframes. What do you think miners will do if this compromise evaporates?
No miners don't get to make the decision, but they certainly are one pillar of the decision making process. Sticking with the unaltered no-timeframe roadmap and not listening to broader user concerns is a push toward a so-called contentious hard fork.
@_date: 2016-02-11 23:59:50
I'm not speaking of the 1MB block size - I believe that there was one other HF done in the early days, perhaps for block versions? I don't recall. Again, it's not super relevant since Bitcoin was a dictatorship or near dictatorship then.
I disagree. Longest Majority Accepted Chain *is* the way bitcoin works today. If miners create a block or a chain of blocks that are not accepted by the economic majority of those running full nodes, these blocks will be discarded. It's as simple as that.
@_date: 2016-02-07 01:09:20
You called it mob rule, thus I presume that you believe there is some sort of a majority pushing for 2MB blocks, no? If there isn't a majority pushing for this change, why the concern about a minority releasing classic? It'll never get 750/1000 blocks indicating block version support.
As far as Classic nodes, with it only being released a few days ago and still in beta form, it's not a surprise there are only a few hundred nodes. Give it 30 days after the stable client has been released.
@_date: 2016-02-20 17:20:25
I consent that there are changes which will be felt as attacking the nature of Bitcoin. The minor block size fork at hand is less likely to be considered contentious by many, the manner it's carried out aside.
Miners are the only ones who can create blocks on a minority chain. If the majority move forward with the proposed 2M HF, I don't believe there will be enough 'religion' on this HF to produce minority chain blocks.
Other issues, yes - just not this one.
@_date: 2016-02-26 17:52:16
Most users that are on coinbase won't care about being able to spend coins on the minority chain, for however long that exists. They've clearly chosen to trust someone else with their private key security and don't want to deal with issues like HFs.
@_date: 2016-02-15 17:03:24
Yes, but if you are the 1% it doesn't matter what you want.
Also, if 75% of the economic majority wish to make a change, who will stop them? It's not worth arguing over - if the incentives are there for the majority to make the change, it will happen - no matter what the minority does or thinks.
Lastly, consensus among mining is more important than features. Just like 25% of the miners/users cannot decide to make a larger block on their own, neither than 25% continue to mine in the face of the desires of the majority. Consensus goes to 100% or near 100% nearly immediately. There's too much at stake one way or another.

In my mind, LN operates somewhat like a multi-purpose gift card where the opening of a channel is the act of funding the gift card, transactions are rapid and instant once the gift card is funded.
If you are going to make a one time payment to a recipient, LN isn't that interesting. However, if you are expecting to perform a significant number of transactions to one or more recipients over a period of time, LN becomes interesting. Buying 3 coffees a day from the same store seems like great use case. Over a month that should save a significant number of fees, no?

Although it was necessary to be a Bitcoin expert during the early days, that no longer is the case and for the most part this is a very good thing. Bitcoin being different not withstanding, we don't expect everyone to fully understand how the banking system works to be able to use an ATM, right?
Users trust their wallets to not allow them to create a transaction that won't likely confirm within a reasonable period of time, at least without a warning. It's unfortunate when wallets let their end users down.
This is what Bitcoin.org and Bitcoin.com should be doing with their wallet listings. Adding a note on each wallet about whether dynamic fees are calculated would be very helpful. Far more helpful for the community than taking Blockchain.info and Coinbase off the list, for example.

I do understand your concerns. How the game theory works out on routing and centralization is certainly not clear in my mind and this may end up being a heavily centralized service. Regardless, I think about it like this:
* LN is a Layer 2 or Layer 1.5 product. Similar to other products that utilize Bitcoin as a settlement layer, these products cannot be stopped from operating since they are not directly part of the underlying protocol. Even for people that hate Coinbase, it cannot be wished away.
* If LN competes with Bitcoin or ChangeTip then so be it. Users will  be educated enough to be able to tell the difference and choose whatever service better suits their needs.
* LN needs bigger blocks to be truly useful for large numbers of users. Scaling the underlying bitcoin layer doesn't need to be compromised to allow LN to succeed.

Why? Running a full Bitcoin node isn't going to work in the worst case scenario. Example Sub-saharan Africa on a 3G capped network or 128kbit ISDN connection with intermittent power.
IMO, Bitcoin nodes can be run decentralized in places where bandwidth is inexpensive, have tens of millions of potential residential hosters and not be available for 90% of the world without issue. Right now 2/3 of the 8bn people on the planet can most definitely not afford to host a node and it does just fine.

If you want to say that BitFury is better for bitcoin, go right ahead. It won't change the fact that validationless mining makes sense at times.

Democracies are a bit different in that most decisions are delegated to a single leader or group of leaders that are supposed to make decisions on behalf of their constituents.
While this can be the case in bitcoin, aka, using Coinbase, Bitfinex, Changetip or other services, it's fairly easy for the user to withdraw their vote of confidence and run to another competing service if the delegate strays too far.
More importantly, end users can retain their own keys via light-wallets or best of all run their own node and/or mine to create blocks. There's no need to merely trust that someone else will do the right thing on our behalf.
I think that your guidelines are fine, but when you really think about it, do you really want an ecosystem where Classic or BU doesn't exist? Isn't it better that there are options and that we don't need to trust a couple of dozen developers needing to agree on one reference implementation at all time? As you say, shine the light of 'truth' as hard as you want on every competing client and let the best solution win.

Thanks - do you have a link for the network protocol change schedule, for my curiosity mostly?
Regarding consensus, I don't see how we are in disagreement. I think very few people think that the 1% can dictate to the 99% on vetoing HF changes and therefore the only question in people's mind is how high is the bar for 'pre-consensus' to be decided upon before introducing such a hard fork. Whether 51%, 75%, 95%, 99% adoption by miners and the harder to measure user/merchant support, that can be debated forever.
I see it that there is no way to prevent a supermajority introducing a change - there is no realistic resistance that the minority can use to effectively prevent a HF from taking place, therefore when there is enough pressure to make such a change, it will occur.
@_date: 2016-02-05 21:28:08
If there's no significant incentive? 12-24 months. With a pending hard fork? Much, much faster.
Edit: How long do you think it'll take to update every node once the 28 day grace period kicks in? How about every node which is relied upon for transactions?
@_date: 2016-02-07 03:24:00
I understand that you feel strongly that the technical arguments for the roadmap vs 2M HF are persuasive for many to stick with the roadmap. I respect that and it's certainly possible that this is the right track.
On the other hand, it's entirely possible that the changing economics of full blocks, something which has never happened in 7 years so far, will be a negative impact. For this reason, it's possible that the roadmap is not sufficient and 2M is necessary sooner rather than later.
What I find amusing from your comments is that you acknowledge that the majority did not side with 20MB/8GB blocks. If they were right to reject this, obviously there's a certain amount of thought put into the decisions of the majority. Have some faith that the same thought process is going on now.
My stance: If the majority decide the roadmap and SW are the way to go, so be it. The same goes for a 2M HF now. I have little concern that there are a majority of sheep who cannot reason and think for themselves.
@_date: 2016-02-20 12:38:28
It's not really that hard. Both mining and exchanges/merchants are relatively centralized in Bitcoin - it's very easy for them to communicate and see if the HF blocks have a market.
Likewise exchanges can relatively easily poll their customers. If their top customers are OK with with a change.
That really leaves developers and "alienation." While that's not a positive outcome, it's not the linchpin which drives the community. Developers will come along with the change or decide to go work on a competitive product.

There’s only one problem with this. UASF didn’t “happen”. 
There was no conflict with UASF and the MASF that activated segwit. If there had been then we would have seen a test of what happens when a small minority of non miners split themselves off the network. Alas this didn’t happen and all this talk about the UASF “event” was just signaling not action.
I’m not saying that a UASF can’t happen or that it wouldn’t be important but just that this one wasn’t a good example of success. Imo, it would have failed completely given the lack of dev and exchange support, but all we get to do is speculate since that hypothesis wasn’t tested.

:) Yes, I'm saying that we're all wasting time trying to get pre-consensus when Bitcoin already has consensus baked in.
Why shouldn't you have to fear that the majority would desire to make a change over the objections of the minority? Bitcoin is incentive based and where there is a strong enough incentive to make a change, it will happen.
The thing which prevents bad changes is that the majority of Bitcoin users (miners, exchanges, etc) are not dumb enough to support changes that have a strong negative overall effect. If you feel otherwise, I'd suggest giving up since there's no fixing that problem.

@_date: 2016-02-15 11:25:54
It's like Gavin says - maybe SW first is best, but if that isn't the case, 2MB HF first gives users/merchants/miners another option.
As usual, assuming that the 'other guy' is out to harm Bitcoin is probably what puts you and your divisive language at odds with the community more than your opinions on the block size debate.

OK, so Gold works fine and has modest 'inflation'. Similarly, I don't see any reason that Monero (or ETH) will have any sort of problems due to their slight inflation, which decreases over time to &lt; 1%. In fact the emission curve for Monero is initially far steeper so by 2020, the annual inflation is lower than Bitcoin.
The lack of default Bitcoin fungibility when compared to XMR is much more troubling than the slight 0.3 XMR / block tail emissions, IMO.
@_date: 2016-09-17 23:24:02
Human error is inevitable, so while I'll grant that we can't know exactly how much is lost annually we know it's fairly significant.
Personally I rather doubt that a slightly inflationary supply would be much different than the fixed 21m  supply, but I could be wrong. As a comparison, gold is slightly inflationary and yet considering a decent store of value.
In any event, the market will decide whether a fixed supply or slightly inflationary supply is superior, since there are competitors to bitcoin with this feature.
@_date: 2016-09-17 18:45:03
It's not really inflation, per se. Considering the amount of coins that are lost every year due to destruction or loss of private keys, a permanent block reward of even something like 0.5-1BTC would probably still work out to a net zero inflation of the coin supply.

It's not that running your own node is a dumb idea - far from it. It's the idea that some large percentage of users must run their own nodes or bitcoin is a failure. If that's the requirement, then we're screwed because there's no way we're going to get millions of users running their own full node.
I see it as a disservice to the community every time someone tells users that if they use blockchain.info or breadwallet or electrum that they're somehow doing it wrong.

If you feel comfortable generating a key on an offline machine and storing it on paper, then you should do that. However, if you do not have access to a clean machine or confidence in your skills to secure it then you need to balance the risk of theft against the risk of loss by storing on coinbase.
I tell most non-technical users that if they don't use a hardware wallet, they are better off using an exchange and just using solid non-SMS 2FA on the exchange and their email account.
You can always get a ledger nano off Amazon. The likelihood that it'll be something which could be tampered with and which the ledger firmware would still be compatible with is extremely remote. It's for this reason that they don't even bother using tamper proof packaging.

Welcome to the "I bought a lot of BTC at $30 in 2011, at $1100 in 2013, at $800 in 2014" club. A few months later it didn't feel great I'm sure, but give it time, it'll feel just fine. Better yet, if you can afford it buy some more and dollar cost average your way in, you'll lower your acquisition costs.

How can ICOs be cancer if you believe in free markets? Educate the investors, provide resources so they can easily sort and identify the different products and then caveat emptor.
The other option is just plain head in the sand maximalism and that doesn't seem in the best interest for the space since it'll cause more friction for bitcoin users when lawmakers write draconian laws that rain on everyone's parade.

Agreed. Even some folks going into retirement and looking for steady income will need to have some of their capital in higher risk investments. If someone is retiring at 60 and expects to possibly live to 90 it's very unlikely that fixed income rates will be enough to support them for 30 years. They'll need to have some balance of equities / crypto / commodities / real estate.

That's a nice theory, but that's as far as it goes since the only way to test it would be a disagreement at the consensus level.
My theory, also unproven, is that a minority of the economy actually runs a node that they physically control. I don't see that changing anytime soon especially as more and more of the world moves toward mobile devices which (currently) are not capable of running a node.
Still, as a minority full node user I'm comfortable that there's enough security in the system as it exists and I appreciate users who choose to delegate verification to others as relevant components of the community, regardless.

I'll see your BIP148 and up with a BIP91, without which I think BIP148 would have fizzled with a minor netsplit. BIP148 would have been a good test of how much of the economy runs full nodes (and supported the UASF) but sanity prevailed and segwit activated prior to playing that game to the end state.
But I do agree that "enough" of the economy runs full node wallets, I just don't think it needs to be a majority and likely never will. Users delegate verification via choosing light wallets or custodial exchanges - maybe this changes with future architecture, but even without it there's enough verification taking place.

Most of the economy is largely unmeasurable except at inflection points where significant parts of the economy disagree about consensus. Aka, potential situations for hard forks whether via UASF or miner hard forks (or just plain bugs) are the times when you might actually find out the intent of the majority of the economy.
There are 50K full nodes, millions of addresses in use. Are you confident enough to say the majority of transactions come from full nodes under individual control even today? And do you really expect the same to hold true if bitcoin eventually becomes used by 100m or 1bn users?

What I generally tell folks:
* 1) Unrecommended investment strategy  putting 100% of your assets in bitcoin.
* 2) Unrecommended investment strategy  putting 0% of your assets in bitcoin.
For literally everyone with disposable income, there's nothing wrong with putting a small percentage of your savings into fast growing but risky investment categories.

Uhh, no - proof of tweet isn't a very useful measurement of project liveliness.
Case in point, Filecoin hasn't tweeted in 6 months - they have several hundred $m in funds and are building what will be likely the best stab at making a monetized implementation of IPFS. It could certainly fail, but dead a year after the ICO? Hardly.

I don’t know why they haven’t updated the space but I’m confident it’s because they have heads down and are building.
Nothing really volatile here since he coins haven’t been issued and don’t trade. Investors are just waiting for as long as it takes.

This is sort of pointless since setting up a tampered windows laptop to run the OOBE is trivial. 
I don't see anything conflicting between the statements "beyond a reasonable doubt" and "it's possible".
The obvious next step for CW to convince everyone who isn't Gavin, Ian Grigg, Matonis or 3 news organizations is to sign some public messages with keys from all or most of the first 5-10 blocks or the genesis block. If he doesn't then clearly he won't win over the bitcoin community or likely even the general public.

Nothing was going to happen on Aug 1st. Literally zero exchanges supported BIP148 so what would it have mattered if some full nodes decided to stop accepting blocks?
BIP148 was severely lacking in support from the economic majority as a whole.

In desperate situations, anyone with a weapon can deprive others of their food, water, gold, etc. We're talking doomsday scenarios here, but in this situation, having gold is only relevant if a) you also possess a weapon and b) you can find someone that values your gold. I personally find that doubtful when just about everyone's concern is starvation or violence.
If the internet is down for a significant period of time, it implies that 1st world infrastructure is also down and in that case the vast majority of people will be in dire circumstances. Returning to the agrarian way of life is simply not plausible for several billion people. Gold or bitcoin are the least of our problems at that point.

Miners should do whatever is in their economic best interest, both short term and long term.
Bitcoin should incentivize miners to do what is in Bitcoin's best interest - telling miners to not mine empty blocks is both a waste of time and counter to their economic best interests due to the value of the block reward.
Long term, the solution is the block reward reduces in value in comparison to fees but short term there's no point in complaining about miner policies with regards to empty blocks.

Says the armchair analyst. We don't know how many requests for withdrawals Coinbase has pending, likely many due to the BCC pending. If those are tapping into Coinbase's cold wallet it takes human intervention to get funds back into the hot wallet and i for one would prefer human review over automated - it can prevent errors and theft, which is ultimately the most important thing Coinbase does.
If you are concerned about everyone rushing for the exit at the same time, better to not keep your funds stored on an exchange at all.
