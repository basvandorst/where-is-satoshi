I think that's why OP put 'original bitcoin white paper' in quotes and mentioned the artificial patina, they're pointing out how ridiculous it is.

Morality is subjective though.  You cannot state categorically that something is or is not immoral and to base a legal system on your set of morals would be pretty unfair to the rest of society.

That sounds like bullshit to me.  Who is your water supplier?

Sounds like bullshit to me.  If it was a fraudulent charge and they reversed the charge I find it hard to believe they wouldn't also reverse the overdraft fees.

I can already do this with my bank account, that is why I don't use checks.  
The problem you experienced was a problem with your behaviour, not with the system.  You have a choice whether to use checks or not.  If you choose to make payments via check then the onus is on you to keep track of how much money you have.  You chose to make payment via check and NOT keep track of how much money you had, and consequently spent more money than you had.  That's your fault, not the system's.

This is the second time you've made a trite little remark like that, you know nothing about me.  I've already said that I don't think that the current financial system is perfect.
Just because I don't completely agree with you doesn't mean I'm some dullard luddite.  I just think that in this specific scenario it is you who is at fault, not the system.
@_date: 2015-06-27 04:08:49
This isn't the systems fault, it's your fault.  


You are the one who spent more money than you had, whether you forgot or whatever is irrelevant, noone spent that money for you.  Keep track of how much money you have and don't spend more than you have.  It's pretty simple.
@_date: 2015-06-28 04:54:51
You don't have to spend your time counting beans, but regardless of whether bitcoin or a fiat currency is used, you need to take individual responsibility for your own finances.
I don't think the current system is perfect, I certainly don't "enjoy" it whatever that means, but I don't think "oh no, I didn't keep track of my own money and spent more than I had and was penalised for it, damn evil banks!" is a legitimate criticism of the current system.

Thanks a lot!  I really appreciate it.  This is a great way to get people involved in the bitcoin community, I've been thinking about learning more about bitcoin and been lurking in a bit, but the generous tips I've recieved have actually motivated me to do something about it and I've spent all day learning.  It's really great!
Thanks again!

Great, thanks for the information!

So prove it :-) my understanding was that the current difficulty level is so high that people mining using their home pc have effectively zero chance of generating a block. But if I'm wrong, show me :-)

So you just keep posting it?  That's a good way to get banned.  Try reaching out to the mods to ask them why they're removing it.
But check the side bar


This post is rubbish, doesn't belong in Maybe in or or something, but it's not bitcoin news.

Looks interesting! :-)

What is this?  I can't access it because I don't have "beta credentials"...
@_date: 2014-11-03 01:36:09
I don't have a wallet or anything but have been interested in learning more about bitcoin, do I need to have a wallet already to be able to get a tip?
@_date: 2014-11-22 03:04:38
Thanks! :-)

Hi there

Edit: fixed the link
@_date: 2014-11-03 01:48:25
Thank you!  This is awesome as I've been wanting to get into bitcoin for months but had no idea how to start.

These are mutually exclusive.
@_date: 2015-05-14 11:05:22
Courts don't just make a judgement like that for no reason.  They may be reasons you don't like, or you don't agree with, but I don't believe the court just threw your case out for no reason.
@_date: 2014-11-06 19:53:42
Sorry I thought you'd replied to a different comment :-)

Somehow I think there must be more to this than you're letting on...

I don't think you know what the word irrelevant means.
The number of credit card transactions being processed daily still dwarfs the number of bitcoin transactions and will continue to do so for some time.  Credit cards and other debt based monetary instruments are far from irrelevant.
@_date: 2015-04-18 08:01:22




What?  "Debt based financial instruments" will continue to be relevant for a long time.  The number of people who are even aware of bitcoin and other cryptos, let alone actively involved, is a tiny proportion of the total population.  If you think people and businesses are going to stop taking loans in fiat from banks anytime soon you are deluded.
