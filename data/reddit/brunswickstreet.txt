It could theoretically work if companies and rich people are made aware of the fact that they are relying on the people working for them or buying their products to be healthy and actually need to be enabled to do these two things. Roads for example, they are build and maintained by the government but are mainly used as a means of transportation to make companies money or to get people to and from work. Its all theoretical and ideologic but i guess you can see where im going.

I've been following Jane Goodall for a long time now and I feel like she and her organisation can make really good use of the money. I think a good introduction to her is [this trailer of one of her latest movies.](

It is a risky investment after all. That is why you hear almost every hodler in here telling people to not buy more than they can afford to lose. And no, you didnt fuck up bad. You made an investment and you have to hold it. Since it was born, bitcoin came back stronger out of every crash so just hold it, see where it goes and be happy that you are supporting [a good cause and a revolution.](

Thanks. Everyone of my friends and a lot of my family talk about bitcoin but its just me and a buddy who actually own a fraction of a coin.

I can understand where you are coming from but you cant say something isnt worth a specific amount (here 15,000$) and then throw in some random numbers that you think it should be worth. If it isnt worth 15.000$ why should it be worth 100$ or even 2000$? It is exactly worth as much as people are paying for it. There is no realistic price for bitcoin because it isnt connected to any real world value. Your statement is fine, just dont fumble around with numbers.


I think the opposite is true, if more people actually knew what bitcoin is trying to accomplish and how it works and that its not controlled or just a currency some random nerds threw pixie dust on, we would have so much more people wanting it. At least thats what I hope. I came for the quick money and stayed for the technology and actually invested most of my money into alternatives that I find more interesting.

More than likely yes. The amount of times we tried to break 9k and the amount of time we consolidated in this range just below 9k makes it really unlikely that we just drop right back through it. We might go back to 9k after failing to break 10 or 11k but i dont think we are going lower again short to midterm.

Doesnt make any sense. If BTCs price is higher the 5% is more money. If you margin trade with say, 0.5 BTC, leveraged blablabla you make more money when BTC is worth more.
It only makes sense if you are always in fiat and just short/long cash out, rinse repeat. Everyone who is in this game cares for the price.
