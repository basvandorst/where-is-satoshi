I'm pretty sure it's a gimmick even without network access.

A challenge-response chip would enable people to check that the public/private keys match and the same problems a counterfeiter has making exact reproductions applies to the original manufacturer as well.

Oh yeah, I'm sure other people have come up with the idea.  However, this is the first time we can bring it full circle by storing the PUF in another blockchain.  Then we get all of the security and censorship-resistance benefits of the blockchain model.  I've put a lot of research into the idea and I figured it was inevitable so I might as well post what I have worked out.

Hey, admins, I'm a lead contributor to Namecoin and this is a direct quote from the person that put these numbers together:






Could you please put a disclaimer on the headline?

I think the LGPL allows for this and (if my memory serves me correctly) they can take their time.  However, even if it was a violation, you can only sue for damages.

HD wallets are better-than-nothing but this kind of analysis is still trivial.

To be perfectly frank, miners make a shitload of money without contributing much to development or anything else.  It was necessary for bootstrapping the currency, but the consolidation of power into a few major mining operations was a historical accident.  
AntPool reflects the priorities of one small organization whose primary expertise is producing ASICs.  Yet they get 15% of the voting power?  They consist of nearly half of the BU miners.
We need rough consensus and running code: every other major player in the Bitcoin industry has chosen to run with SegWit and 80% of nodes run Bitcoin Core.

SHA-3 was designed to perform really well in hardware, so it would only make things worse.
@_date: 2017-03-27 02:01:21
And what is the rest of this thread made of?  :p
@_date: 2017-03-29 07:00:58
Meh, it's still just trading one ASIC friendly hash for another.  Argon2 is I/O bound and it's going to be harder to optimize DRAM.

I'm sure you *can* create a passphrase that no one can crack, but there are safer alternatives that are more foolproof.  The problem with brainwallets is that you are turning the blockchain into a *public* database of password hashes that can be mined in an automated fashion.
It's much better to encrypt a traditional private key with a password/passphrase and store it in a non-public venue.  Even if you zip the encrypted blob and upload it to a file-locker, at least you wouldn't be broadcasting the location nor the contents of the file to potential attackers.

Wake me up when inflation spikes or debt to GDP ratio gets above ~200%.

Wouldn't it be better to mix PoW and PoS?  That would actually have a chance at getting adopted by the existing community.

To be of any value, the BitCoins must buy something in meatspace that the extortionist wants.  Even with laundering, you can [trace the coins]( through the network.

Bitfury has raised $90 million in venture capital.  Good luck raising enough to compete with them.

I hate software patents, but I'm gonna let this one slide as it screws over anyone using AsicBoost.
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:50:12
There's a $30 bounty out there for Jihan if he adopts any proposal that bans asicboost.  Care to chip in?

They aren't as efficient as SegWit and this fixes a lot of other issues, like transaction malleability.
@_date: 2017-05-31 00:04:59


If you use a rudimentary economic mode.  Economists also argue that the only way to keep transaction prices high is to introduce competition.  ; )  
Bitcoin can't handle micro-transactions, financial institutions will setup their own off-chain settlement systems, and Ethereum offers similar capabilities independent of what Bitcoin chooses to do.  In the big scheme of things, I would prefer to charge banks $1,000 to clear an unlimited number of transactions after closing a payment channel than to miss out on that money entirely.
I'm not saying there aren't solid reasons to increase the on-chain bandwidth, but this debate is not trivial.

They create them by paying random people in the industry money to come onto their shows and say crazy shit in an effort to boost their ratings.

... or switch to Ethereum.  I mean, it's not like they don't already have options.  This just gives Bitcoin what Ethereum already offers.

Did the same thing once, got $2K out of the deal.  Of course, that would be worth $40K today but at least I didn't have to call my parents and ask for help with rent.

I thought that the patchset was minimal, some ~200 lines of code?  Is there an ELI5 on how Silbert's SegWit differs from the existing codebase?
@_date: 2017-05-31 00:27:03


Yeah, the increase to 2MB part of the agreement is just that: an agreement.  I don't really blame those on the other side for stalling until they are more confident that the 2MB increase will occur.
Meh, where's the popcorn?

@_date: 2017-05-30 23:24:49
I saw the NYC agreement and assumed everything was settled.  I mean, any miner using Core just needs to start signaling for segwit right?  Is there an ELI5 explanation somewhere of what has transpired since then?
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:22:53
Kraken is a pretty conservative exchange, but I'll ask one of the original founders next time I talk to him.

I think this article is FUD, but the replay attacks happened to their exchange.  I'm guessing that exchange users have a different level of insurance.

Yeah, part of the appeal of Kickstarter and Indigogo is that they can drive traffic to projects, kickstarting the donations. :p
