I got banned form circle which sucks and the only place i can buy with debit now is Coinbase...I wish their where more services like circle around that use debit cards....Meh i need to unload coins right...and lbc is a no go cause of ny law bullshit

I'd pay premium if I would get my btc to usd next day though but purchase should be cheap depending on what you use

We need more btc providers like circle but fuck my friend got me banned from circle pisses me off. I wish a good investor could build up a good btc exchange that accepts debit and check that's fast and cheap

He had some btc in a sportsbook, he sent the btc to me directly from his sportsbook to my circle account which was a no no... he owed me cash so he payed me via bitcoin but I didn't know he was sending coin from sportbooks...I miss circle so so much I wish their where more companies like this!
