I own cloud mining at cex.io. I think everyone here is being paranoid and are overreacting.

Literally nothing is stopping a government from doing this.

Volume is at almost the lowest ever levels though. No one is buying any more, a lot of people are going to be very surprised when they try to cash out.

A shitload of wasted energy?

My bank has fee-free and low-fee accounts. In fact, with only a few thousand dollars and no fees, my bank *gives me money for free* in the form of interest.

Except for basically all currency anywhere.

Truly this is a subreddit that never stops giving.

Dogecoin is the fastest growing altcoin, and offers many benefits Bitcoin lacks.

What do you do with the bitcoin you are paid?
@_date: 2014-02-12 07:35:55


Holy shit.
Get out while you still can!

Maybe you have too much money? Or you just don't like the idea of having money. Maybe you're particularly gullible? Who knows?

Why $700? Why not make a community effort to make the price $5000?

I spend them? 


My question is pretty simple and straightforward. Why would someone not want to answer it?
I am just curious as to whether they're a) keeping the bitcoins, b) spending the bitcoins, or c) converting the bitcoins to Australian dollars?

I don't travel, I spend what I earn. My country provides a generous pension to retirees.


My point is that it's pretty complicated, especially for a business. You're also indirectly asking for a window into their view on how the exchange rate will perform, leading to future egg-on-face potential they may wish to avoid.
Why are you trying to avoid the question and change the subject? There's literally only three outcomes the choose from.

This is a meaningless figure - no one will give him $43,420,000 if he tried to sell it.

It's funny because your investment could be worth nothing in a matter of hours.

Surely you realise that no matter how much you believe or how idealistic you are, there is literally no evidence to suggest this will ever happen!

Does your friend realise that's the Thai Baht symbol?

Banning banks from selling or buying or allowing any customer to sell or buy bitcoins through the bank would shut it off for 99% of the population and would effectively kill bitcoin.

lol log scale.

This doesn't fill me with confidence. Why put money into something if you expect it to be worthless?
