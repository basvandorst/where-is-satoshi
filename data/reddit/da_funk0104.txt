No i haven't been there yet. I just know the area. I haven't had time to go for a drink in ages. Definitely gonna try it soon, though!

Ah Niederlassung. Nice area to live ;)

Munich really needs to step up its game in Bitcoin :/ Only 3 places accepting it in the whole city.

Yeah i do understand the skepticism. But as a figure of public life and of the financial industry you should know better than to just rant against something before even researching it. 
I am very positive though that with growing adoption the understanding will grow too.
Of course i hope that i will become a millionaire because of bitcoin, but i'm also perfectly fine if the price stays where it was when i bought and i can use them to just comfortably buy stuff using my phone :)

Yeah i agree, but why downvote the article? 
Just giving a heads up to what some idiots out there are thinking. 
Edit: meant to write that  not @ you

That's just great!  Last year I donated some money and thought about why they don't accept Bitcoin.  This year I was already on the Donation Site but didn't want to go through the hassle and thought again why aren't they accepting Bitcoin? 
Now I can contribute to one of my favourite and most used (ad-free and free to use)  website with my favourite technology.  Unfortunate that there's only the link.  They might wanna show the Bitcoin symbol somewhere I  the donation page.  I nearly missed it. 
Is a Bitcoin donation also tax deductible?  
Thanks for the Info anyway,  you guys rock

Greetings from Germany!

And tasty it was!

I ordered a [very very nice Burger]( at a Food Delivery Service in Germany with Bitcoins. I regret nothing

Bit pay is just great!  The Pizza/Burger/Curry places don't have to get into Bitcoin but I can order from all of them with Bitcoin.  I just hope that more and more delivery sites offer Bit pay ;)  it's fast, reliable and easy to use.

Yeah i get that, still important to watch the media perception.

That doesn't sound too shabby.  Thanks

I am using DKB bank and never had any problems.  There is no service fee for a Giro account plus when you also open a Visa Account you can withdraw cash without fees from any ATM worldwide.  I was a Sparkasse customer but I switched and have never been happier.

OK,  maybe my employer finally blocked the site..
