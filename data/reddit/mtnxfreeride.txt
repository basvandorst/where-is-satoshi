At my rate of growth in fairly large market-cap coins for safety and starting in July 2017... HAD I put in $3000, it would have hit $18,000 at the peak last month and be sitting at ~$10,000 today...  that is a tiny piece of a down payment turned into a decent chunk at the peak..  another 12 months of similar growth (3.5x every 6 months) would be $122,000

how about the world bans china from crypto?

3-5 years in crypto is 3-5 months.

sounds like you are a good candidate to take out a home loan now for more than you can afford, and instead of putting it to the house, throw it in BTC and once it moons take it out and pay cash for the house../troll

Leave them a 1 star review in the app store... they are busy forcing BCH down customers throats instead.

"would have liked to have seen even ****just**** one thousand percent increase this month."

what a terrible system...  they can claim metric as better, but this is backwards... you dont use periods mid sentence and you don't use commas to finish a sentence.
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:53:02


I did a few months ago.. its doing terrible.. someone called mining a fad and the stock dropped 15%.. been lagging since.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:44:22
I was joking... 
No one really has money they cannot afford to lose... you would need a home in tip top shape, a good bank account buffer, no debt, and a retirement account in perfect shape...   otherwise it is just doing things (investing) in moderation enough that wont set you back more than you are comfortable. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:35:48
I didn't say it was a metric thing.  I was comparing things that the US claims is correct (Imperial vs. Metric) against this period vs. comma.   
@_date: 2018-06-25 17:35:23
having the month repeated in multiple columns makes it harder to compare numbers side by side.
@_date: 2018-06-25 17:34:29
probably is missing because it doesnt follow the trend.

This is why I wont buy NANO...  12% of the coin was stolen... some day its going to be sold off.

that'll teach you to crap faster.

There is going to be a another round of people who bought in the 2017 craze and it all lost enough value that they forget where it is stored or their passwords etc..   
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:56:37


was that not yesterday? thats all I heard...
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:13:21


And about fake news and manipulation.  BTC itself fundamentally has not changed significantly in the last month...
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:19:45


what is there to regulate?  KYC and tax reporting?

great year..  not 8 years... stagnant before this past year.

31 accounts were logged into over the course of months and an api generated, that is not widespread or suspicious at all...  It all comes down to idiots logging into fake sites getting their login info stolen..

uhh yeah im serious.. you pulled out year by year stats.. most people have had their money in before 2008...   it took 6 years of Obama to break even from the all time high in 2008...

Until people can convert to fiat fast/cheap its just as slow/expensive IMO..  If family needs to send money, its usually needed asap when a check cannot be sent or when paypal (no fees) wont work fast enough (instant if you have a paypal debit card/verified accounts etc).  I would say we need more Bitcoin ATMs, but they have fees also since they need to pay rent, electricity, internet connection, expensive machine, security for machine, and someone to refill/manage it.  I cant buy BTC without fees, I cant transfer it without fees, and the recipient again will pay fees to convert to usable fiat currency.  Until someone creates a debit card system (kind of like TenX I think?) fees will still exist... but is that debit system much better than Paypal today?  This of course all changes if BTC is accepted everywhere.
@_date: 2018-02-04 00:48:47
Yup.. they do tend to use debit cards a lot though.  I used a credit card a lot on coinbase before attaching a bank account... felt safer.. it was never debt.

looking at my power bill in Maine, its running 15 cents a kwh once you factor in price per kwh + transmission +taxes
