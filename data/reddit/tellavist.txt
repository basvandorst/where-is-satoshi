Depends on some factors.
Where you are from
Fiat currency
Those kind of things:)
Heres a [list](

@_date: 2017-05-11 16:48:12

@_date: 2017-05-18 14:04:01
oh boy, I googled replaced by fee tx, and it seems it's still getting over my head.
Would you be so kind to elaborate?
@_date: 2017-05-11 16:47:29
Now i want a bong-bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:48:02
Then switch to a different exchange?
@_date: 2017-05-26 08:16:11
good fucking luck with bringing back a 200km big piece of rock/copper/iron/godknows what.
I want my 5 minutes back.
@_date: 2017-05-26 08:13:37
holy shit that's smart! 
It's the: 
"fucking hell, why the hell couldn't I come up with that..." kind of smart.
@_date: 2017-05-09 11:06:22
this is awsome.
@_date: 2017-05-26 08:01:25
Sit back, relax, and: HODL
Dont sell shit.
You shouldn't invest any money you can't aford to lose into bitcoin to begin with.
That's how I keep my cool.
@_date: 2017-05-11 16:44:37
Best reaction possible.
@_date: 2017-05-26 10:36:40
not on EVERY purchase, for example:
The cashier @ your local supermarket (big brand) has absolutely no influance in that dicision ofcourse. So I won't bother going into a convo with her. Although I sometimes just mention it briefly like:
"to bad you guys still don't accept BTC". 
But after that, I won't invest any more time. I just mention it. The more people will mention it, the more people will know about it. It's really just the fundementials of marketing.
If I make a purchase for example somehwere where the OWNER stands behind the counter. Then I try to strike up a convo about BTC.
I just ask him: hey man, is it ok if I pay with BTC? And he will normaly go: ehm, no?! but I did hear about it! what is it?
Then I will proceed to explain a bit, what the advantages are I mention some big companies who already accept them etc. etc.
BTC is kind of a little hobby and a good convo starter if you ask me.
It so happends to be that every convo you strike about it, the price potentially gets up which means -&gt; I get more money by just talking about it.
this is the big picture ofcourse. But if we all did this, the interest in BTC will be tenfold in no time. (and it's already kind of happening)

As many as she likes! Maybe one girl also wants a private jet and private island aswell. I mean where other then a private island to fly your helicopters to?!
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:52:39
Technically it does hold coin... BUT YOU GET MY DRIFT! 
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:31:58
It isn't always high, sometimes its lower then other exchanges.
I have 5 different exhanges open on tab on my PC always. Cex.io seems the first one to hit 3000. (actually 3030 now...)
@_date: 2017-05-26 09:56:43
@_date: 2017-05-26 10:16:09
I agree with you, you're doing a good cause.
But the real focus should still be when you have to make a fiat purchase somehwere again...
ALWAYS ASK THIS QUESTION:
Can I buy with bitcoin here?
No? Why not?
Elleborate. and try to inform the store owner about bitcoin.
Bitcoin is all fun and games, unless you have nowhere to spend them. 
The focus should still be on marketgrowth. And awareness. 
It still baffles me how little people ask this, if they make a purchase in fiat somewhere.
@_date: 2017-05-11 16:44:11
I bought 2btc like 2 months ago for fun and games at $930. I woke up this morning and doubled my investment.
Great way to start the day. Really hard to not get used to ATH's every other day when you are just entering this game lol xD
@_date: 2017-05-26 08:06:04
you never have enough bitcoin...
What the hell man?!
In all seriousness.
I work with a 50/50 rule for my savings.
50% of my savings sits safe into a savingsaccount with shit interest rate. This way, if bitcoin suddenly goes to $0 well, to bad. but I still have money to fall back on.
The other 50% -&gt; you guessed it homeslice. they go into BTC.
Every month, i just drop some money into BTC.
Works like a charm for me.
@_date: 2017-05-09 11:04:45
as long as the moon is the end station, I don't care if it gets corrected to $200
@_date: 2017-05-11 09:22:37
how'd the pizza taste buddy?
@_date: 2017-05-11 09:47:47
because it makes buying more scary lol XD
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:28:11
from $2000 ATH to $3000 ATH in a week.
I got in on $800 1,5 months ago. I wake up everyday with an even bigger smile on my face. 
This shit seems to good to be true :') 
@_date: 2017-05-26 10:51:26
Oh shucks that sucks balls mate! I'm sorry for your loss!
I do have a question about this.
I store my BTC on a wallet on my USB.
No wallet on any PC or somewhere on a website.
I also keep 3 copies of my seed on 3 different offline locations if my usb gets lost.
Why on earth would you store 15BTC on a wallet that is run by an exchange?
Is it for day trading or?
If you HODL. it's best to just store them offline somewhere right?
@_date: 2017-05-26 10:25:29
i didn't miss the point the slightest bit. 
That's what the first sentence was for.
I do have to agree 90% of my comment has nothing to do with your post.
Just wanted to vent a bit, your post was unfortunate enough to provide me with a platform to vent on ;)
Good day mate!
@_date: 2017-05-09 16:38:13
Well written? Thanks! :D
As for well thought out. I have to disagree with that a bit.
It's still a risk. And you can think of BTC what you want. But you are never going to be sure.
I believe in BTC and it's future though. Thats why I bought. Not for the quick gainz. EZ monies or anything like that.
But for later. When there are houses being bought for a single coin. Because fuck banks. 
The people decide whats value and whats not.
Governments can try and regulate all they want.
No one is going to know how much BTC you hold.
(If done correctly)
I like that.
