Uh you do realize that the big story for this leak is that the CIA accidentally lost control of this technology and now its out in the wild for hackers and criminals to use right?
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:29:39
The real news isn't that the CIA was doing all of this, it's that they let the secrets and technology get out in the wild for criminals to use and didn't tell anybody.

You just gotta think about what you plan on doing, and then realize everyone else is thinking the same thing so position yourself to execute the plan ahead of time.  With BCC it was very obvious that everyone would dump last second to get free BCC and then dump back in right after the snap shot, nobody turns down free money, people are greedy.  Doesn't hurt to use Coinigy since its way easier to put in orders than using the web interface for bittrex.  Also having 2 monitors so you can watch bitcoin and the alt coins you are trading at the same time.  Key to trading is realizing its just a game that people are playing, so if you understand how most people think you can be two steps ahead of the herd.

I'm enjoying the manipulation.  I made a months salary from it by simply not being aware I could sell BCC until I woke up this morning and it was selling for $1000 on Bittrex lol.
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:48:12
Only way you were going to make big money on BCC is if you kept all your Bitcoin on Bittrex so you could trade it Day 1 before the big dump.  Whales on Bittrex pumped BCC to 0.48578900 .  I sold mine at .45.  Basically made 45% of my bitcoin on top of placing a buy stop order on LBC and STRAT above the price they were dumped too a minute before the fork went live.  Everyone jumped right into alt coins 5 seconds later, instantly went up 30% on each bitcoin went down to $2500 at the top of the spike, sold back into bitcoin at the low.  Proffit$$$$$.  Gotta take risks to play the game, never follow the crowd because most people suck at making money.  By the time the exchanges open up for BCC deposits, the party will be over.

Hong Kong is one of the freest economies in the world, probably more than the US has been in 100 years.  They don't even have capital gains taxes, they don't care about bitcoin exchanges lol.  US exchanges are more likely to be shut down than Bittrex because of Muh Terrorism and Muh Tax evasion lol.  Their government and economy is completely independent from China.

Yes I'm talking about trading.  Investors should still trade but only on the big picture like selling at 3k, waiting for the reversal and buying back in at $2400.  If you got 10 bitcoins thats $6000 profit right there.  Key to safe trading is to sell and buy back the same amount of coins at a lower price,  the difference between them is your profit.  Many people try to sell high and buy even more coins low, but all that does is increase your risk causing you to gradually become more prone to panic as your risk increases.  Only trade what you willing to lose, when you only risking a small amount of trading capital you can take emotions out of the equation and make smart moves.  if you have $10,000 10-12% a day is pretty reasonable on solid alt coins, not necessarily all in 1 trade, usually 2  or 3 trades per day.  average 5% is easy,  make 5% a day, you making $500 a day.  You can live off that, every once in a while you get really lucky, but if you use stop losses you will never be extremely unlucky.  Its like playing a casino where the odds are always stacked 5:1 in your favor when you do it right.  If you learn trading with a small amount of money, it really helps investors understand the big picture where you are looking at daily and weekly charts so you can spot the good dips to buy in with new money for accumulation I started just trading evenings and weekends as a hobby because its actually pretty fun and got pretty good after a while.
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:03:35
Well if you kept your coins on Bittrex like I did, you missed out on a 50% gain.  Once I saw what was happening it was obvious BCC was gonna get pumped by whales, they pump everything and this one has no price history to fight against and tons of hype and uncertainty.  Its what I would do.  Never thought they'd pump it this much though.
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:30:48
Haha well played.  But seriously I'm just trying to give good advice.  Buy and Hold is a Meme created by Wallstreet traders to dump shitty stocks on old people who believe in holding for 20 years to make a profit.  There is a reason they always say to hold 20 years, because 18 years doesn't work. Meanwhile they are buying the bottom and making money today and aren't waiting 20 years lol.
@_date: 2017-08-03 04:22:56
I think $2250 is the lowest we will go at this point, $2400 for sure in the near future, then we rally back to the high.  Just depends on if we bounce from $2400 or $2250.
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:06:01
Well if you Sell BCH for BTC and then all the value comes back to BTC you now have 50% more BTC + whatever value BTC gained if you sell while its pumped over $1000 again.
@_date: 2017-08-03 04:20:27
I think at some point BCH will be a good coin to trade on, but right now is not the time to buy and hold lol.  Even ETH classic has its moments.
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:56:19
Don't use coinbase, use GDAX or Gemini to buy and sell coins and save yourself hefty fees.  Use coinbase as a phone wallet only if you want to spend coins.
Option 2 Have an account on Bittrex
Buy ETH, send ETH to Bittrex,  Sell ETH for BTC,  Send BTC to your Trezor or paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:07:42
Oh I'm sure this won't be the last pump and dump on BCC.
@_date: 2017-08-03 04:01:08
Because there was no way in hell it could have broken the sell wall at .5  so I market sold into the books while I was sitting there watching it.  If you click on the little blue arrow next to an order on the bid book you can market sell your entire stack into every order up to that one without having to type in prices.
@_date: 2017-08-03 04:17:10
Neither do I but I was only 15 minutes late for work that morning.  You can trade on a 4 hour chart to catch the big swings though.  Maybe 2 or 3 trades per week that way.
@_date: 2017-08-03 04:13:49
If you understand how to read the moving averages you can tell 9/10 times the direction the price will move, the only exception is a whale jumping in and fucking up your plan lol.  If you understand Fibbonaci retracement and how to spot the resistance levels you can usually tell exactly where the price will bounce over a given time frame.  RSI is good as a 3rd indicator to confirm overbought and oversold.

Gemini is heavily regulated, same standards of security as online stock exchanges.  Even if they store your private info in a database somewhere it will be datamasked and encrypted.  The Government is really strict on securing that kind of information.

Bitcoins main value comes from it being the only coin you can speculate on all of the alt coins with.  Real technological use will come later, speculation makes money now, and lots of it if you know what you are doing.  I Turned 1 btc into 8 btc during the bear market playing volatility games.  This stuff trades nicely.

We will probably have another dip from where we are now but if we get a higher low, that's a good sign of a trend reversal,  keep an eye on weekly charts because all of the big money will be.  Inexperienced investors open the market, pros close it.

Its just testing the bottom of the trend line.  Higher lows, and lower highs.  It's getting ready to make a big move to test $3,000 again.  When it does, expect it to consolidate above $3,000. We're trading against the devaluing US dollar and the stock market overdue for a major correction.  Once all that money looking for a safe haven comes flooding into BTC, it's going to the moon. $40,0000,000,000 market cap is nothing, next stop 4 Trillion. Accumulate bitcoin, trade cryptos against bitcoin, start thinking of bitcoin as the primary currency to accumulate instead of worthless paper of a dying system.  Only 2 futures are possible, the internet being around and crypto currency being the primary means of exchange, or the internet being shut down due to global catastrophe in which case fiat is also worthless.  Only 2 currencies you need to invest in to be prepared for either, bitcoin and bullets.  EDIT:New ICO Idea - Bullet coin.

Not as much as 100 BTC.  Which is how much you'll have when you sell to the suckers and buy it back from them at pennies on the dollar later.

I dunno, maybe they should fix their trading platform to prevent giant trading bots from selling down the entire market to .01 in 2 seconds causing everyone to auto liquidate their $300 assets for $2 right before it shoots back up to $300 2 seconds later.   This kind of market manipulation needs to be limited by putting a reasonable Max cap on sell orders like other exchanges already do.   This isn't an ETH bailout its a Coinbase fuckup, which is why coinbase is paying for it.  This is bad press for them and if they don't make it right people will use other exchanges and they will lose even more money over the long haul.  I trade on Gemini, lowest we got was $280 during the flash on GDAX, easiest $50 1 day flip I ever made.

ASICs only work for certain coins.  Mining with GPUs is better because you can mine a wide variety of coins in Multi-Pools and get paid in whatever crypto you want.  ASICs are a scam anyways, unless you get the first batch you'll never hit your ROI.  When Bitmain was about to release its new LTC ASIC miners they pumped the price of LTC to get people to buy and dumped it after the orders were filled.  Its what I would do If I was in the business of selling miners and was sitting on ass loads of BTC.

Unless you have the private key to your wallet, you don't own the coins.  If a 3rd party such as coinbase can freeze your assets at will you might as well be using fiat.  The whole point of crypto was to remove centralized 3rd party control over your money.

Its 100% passive if you know some python and make a bot that calculates the market interest rate and lends your coins out, or you just download a bot that does it already, otherwise it will just re lend at the last interest rate you used.  Using bots is a little tricky but nothing you can't pickup.  Python is meant to be an easy language that anyone can understand and a good skill to have if you are interested in programming at all.  There are some youtube videos out there that can walk you through it.

Remember folks buy fear and sell greed.  Never the other way around.  90% of people lose money because they buy greed and sell fear.  Never buy all at once, and never sell all at once, since this helps manage the FOMO and FUD.  Buy small amounts when nobody wants it,  sell when everyone wants it, and bail when the current wave doesn't reach the all time high of the last wave.  And for god sakes don't try predict to  Rinse, repeat.  And for God sakes, don't try to predict the bottom when people are panicking, buy after they start jumping off buildings and have given up on life.  The next bubble is one news cycle away and it will be bigger than the last one.

The main reason holding will beat selling 99.9% of the time is not only are people bad traders, but the bitcoin holders can make 30% more BTC a year loaning bitcoin at high interests rates to margin traders on top of the insane growth bitcoin already has.  We Illuminati now.

Coinbase is ok if all you are going to do is hold.  When their is a big dip and you want to buy more, don't be suprised when it crashes.
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:33:53
Gemini, or GDAX.  Coinbase basically just trades your coins on GDAX and charges you a high fees for doing so.  GDAX trade is like 0.25% for instant buy/sell while coinbase is 1-2%  buy/sell from your bank with a 3-5 day waiting period, which is more like a 10 day wating period.  My Eth was supposed to arrive Tuesday when it was close to its all time high and I wanted to sell, doesn't arrive until tomorrow now.  Will never use Coinbase again.  Coin Mama is pretty good too if you want to buy bitcoins for cash, or better yet learn to use Local Bitcoins so you can buy and sell coins at starbucks off the grid  face to face.
@_date: 2017-06-13 14:09:10
Coin-base is not meant for trading.  Its not a real exchange, it doesn't have robust tools for trend forecasting.  Its meant to be an easy on ramp for new people getting into bitcoin.  If you wanna trade on these high volume moves you need to be on Gemini, GDAX, Bitfinex, Kraken, etc.  Get signed up now because it took me almost 2 weeks to get my identity verification for Gemini, I assume the other exchanges are similar.  I was on Gemini all day through the high volume trading time and there wasn't as much as a hiccup in performance or responsiveness.  If you like Coinbase get on GDAX, I believe there is no fee for transferring you Coinbase and GDAX coins back and forth.  Think of Coinbase as your checking account, and your GDAX as your trading account.
@_date: 2017-06-27 15:29:46
Holders that make high interest loans to traders.  You get your coin back plus interest after the loan expires, the borrower gives it back to get a lower interest rate from another lender, or the borrower's position is liquidated to pay you back.  Its relatively low risk for the lenders, never heard of anyone losing their coins but do your own research, start small, and once you get the hang of it and know what you are doing, act accordingly.  Your coin will be on an exchange though, so factor that in to your risk calculation.  Poloniex is pretty legit though.  Its a great way to make extra btc on coins you plan on holding for a while. With compound interest growth it really adds up.

AOL used to be the monolithic internet company.  Now its barely in the top 20 ISP.  Never get married to an investment, especially in the technology world where things move quickly and today's innovations  will be tomorrows Myspace.  Follow the trends, watch the market, and play it like a video game. Know when to hold, when to take profits, and when to cut your losses.  Right now BTC is in a heavy down trend and there are no market indicators that indicate we've turned around so buy the bottoms and sell the tops.  Every coin has a market cycle.  When the next breakout happens you will know what indicators to look for if you know what you are doing.  If you don't know what you are doing, just buy the dips, and hold.  Never sell on retracement, but cut your losses if the support falls out.  That being said,  the market cap for the whole ecosystem could easily be 1 Trillion next year and BTC will be getting a large chunk of that one way or another.
