Who are "most people"?  I certainly don't remember any such widespread feeling in the 90s, at least among people who knew what the internet *was*.
The trouble I see with these world-changing visions for Bitcoin is that there's already a massive and deeply entrenched financial system in place, and it's not entirely clear to me what advantage cryptocurrency provides that will overcome that.  The internet did not have to displace another well-developed internet.

Yeah, exactly.
let me guess: we're apparently supposed to believe you've broken both MD6 and SHA256, but you're not taking any requests for custom vanity addresses.  
But in case you're not a sockpuppet of this fake Satoshi and just someone who seems to be vigorously defending him for some odd reason, let me spell it out:  it's only "impossible" to map firmly constrained inputs to firmly constrained vanity addresses this way.  If your output is practically unconstrained, and your input only loosely so, and you can search 256 permutations of each input you can think of that's vaguely bitcoin-related * however many hash algorithms you're testing, the probability that you find *some* short string of plausible English is not that low.  Now if you can twiddle the outer 8 bits of a hash of "I am Satoshi" and find a vanity address that leads with "Nakamoto" *then* I will believe you are some kind of cryptographic wizard.

*No, it isn’t*.  The value is set by supply and demand.  Miners are significant market players, but if there is no demand for bitcoin, miners can’t create it.  If every miner chooses to mine some worthless fork, they don’t automatically make it valuable.  They mine bitcoin *because* it is valuable.

Lol, what on earth makes you think you're worth 10 seconds of anyone's time? But ok, since I'm bored at work I found your deleted post and tried to figure out what you're doing. 
Okay, so you found a hash of some sequence of characters tenuously related to bitcoin (probably out of a pool of many candidate strings and hash algorithms, considering you went with the somewhat obscure MD6), and a modification to it that provides a leading string of plausible English entirely unrelated to bitcoin/satoshi/etc when converted to a bitcoin address.  How this "cryptographic card trick", as another user calls it, proves you're Satoshi Nakamoto (or, for that matter, someone with more than a basic familiarity with using crypto libraries) is entirely unclear.  It's neat and must have been a fun little weekend scripting project (or possibly a more laborious project of several years of mental illness, depending on how much you automated the search).

This is nonsense.
A bitcoin is not a share in a mining company - it does entail ownership or any rights whatsoever to any of those tangible assets.  
The case for proof of work is that it's the most robust way to secure a blockchain - for example, even if there's an attacker in the middle between a merchant and the network, trying to double-spend, it would be exceedingly difficult/expensive for them to create a believable forged block.  Proof-of-stake systems fundamentally have lower barriers for these kinds of attacks, and various other issues like how you fairly distribute new coins.

No, they wouldn't be.  The way mining works, basically, is that you have to guess a random number that's part of the block that produces a hash with a certain number of leading zeroes that correspond to the difficulty. This becomes exponentially more computationally intensive the more zeroes you need.
@_date: 2018-03-03 02:05:36


I'm not really sure what your point of confusion is.
If transactions are free, then you're just batting that 1BTC around between your addresses and the sum total of BTC involved doesn't change.
If there's a transaction fee, some of your 1BTC will have to go to the miners and the sum total of BTC involved doesn't change.

I suppose you can audit their verilog or whatever, but in that case you're still trusting the lowRISC guys that they actually fabricated what's in the design and didn't (either maliciously or through oversight) leave security holes in their design that you missed - and it's not really obvious why you'd trust them more than a big company like ST (whose chips Trezor uses), which makes lots of chips actually used in security applications and has both the experience and financial skin in the game to make their designs relatively secure.
Personally I wouldn't try to reinvent the wheel here.  The existing hardware wallets seems to work okay - to me anyway, it seems best to just build on their work.

Well, because the bitcoin network expects the blocks it receives to have both a valid hash of a block of a rule-abiding chain, and have something like ~80bits be zeroes.  With the mathematical properties of a cryptographic hash, there's simply no way to find this value without brute-force guessing.

Bitcoin *cannot replace all of the above*.  I wish people would stop peddling this false equivalence.

I don't think you understand what Bitcoin *can* replace without additional services/intermediaries.
If the only service the financial industry needed to provide was to facilitate shuffling numbers around digital addresses, it could be running on one computer in some basement.  Bitcoin *is* energy-inefficient, by design - right now, ridiculously so, due to how much money miners collect from block rewards.  I did the math a week back: you could drive a Tesla Model 3 across the United States and a good part of the way back on the energy burned by *one transaction* (using the digiconomist numbers).   That is the very premise of its security model.

The average block time would be inversely proportional to the change in hashrate.

@_date: 2018-03-15 01:23:34
Making it more energy-efficient is impossible without radically redesigning the fundamentals of the protocol.  
You could change the PoW function to make it ASIC-resistant (it'd be a hard fork but trivial, technically), but the incentive will still be to throw as much hashpower online as you can afford and can make money doing.  
@_date: 2018-03-25 02:18:04

@_date: 2018-03-15 19:10:55
It's *not* exactly the same - the problem isn't "find anyone who has any piece x I don't have over any network path to them", in a network where a good number of people likely already have pieces you don't have, and the pieces propagate exponentially, but "find my landlord Bob along a specific (preferably shortest/cheapest) path where every hop has enough funds in the channel to route the payment" - this is a quite different problem with meaningful implications for routing.
And since lightning is a scaling solution, the question isn't "can this work with 1000 users", but "can this work with 100 million users and still be decentralized".  We know routing works fine at a small scale, or with a somewhat centralized network.

Because a small loss is better than a large loss?  But it doesn't really matter.  The price can and, due to the difficulty mechanism, *will* go below the threshold of profitability for some significant portion of miners and there's nothing they can do except stop their rigs.  Supply is anyone willing to sell BTC on the market, not just miners.  Most of the coins that will exist already exist.  The whole "its backed by miners" argument doesn't make any economic sense.  If anything, there will be less downward pressure on the price with subsequent block halvings when you don't have miners constantly cashing out to pay for terawatts of electricity.

It's just silly branding.  BCH is basically bitcoin that can handle higher on-chain transaction throughput (at the expense of larger blocks).  "Cash" it isn't.

Eh, at this point unless you want to spend your days hunting down obscure shitcoins or the price shoots way up it's hardly worth the bother.
If you want to, the easiest way to start is nicehash - it will automatically mine whatever cryptos are most profitable on your hardware and pay you in bitcoin.  If you want a less automated but potentially more profitable process, you can figure out what coins are most profitable on your 1070 (here, for example:  ), get the wallet/mining software for whatever you decide to mine, and you'll probably need to find a pool to mine as part of.  More specific instructions will depend on the specific coin.

For transactions where you're willing to tolerate a small risk of double spending attempts, and if the network accepts only the first transaction it sees, it's generally good enough, since it would in most circumstances win the race - it seems to be how Satoshi Nakamoto envisioned Bitcoin's confirmation time being addressed in practice.
Of course, when the network is at the block size limit that doesn't work so well.

@_date: 2018-03-09 22:05:16
The market.
And the market seems mostly speculative.  Ie, people are mostly buying it because they think it will keep going up, rather than to use it for something.
@_date: 2018-03-27 22:59:51
That has nothing to do with whether it's "backed" or not.   The value of a dollar is not backed by the cost of manufacturing dollar bills.  
A "backed" currency is something that is redeemable for something like gold or silver or some other commodity at a fixed ratio.  In the crypto world, you could say Tether is backed by the dollar, because Tether/Bitfinex will (at least in theory) exchange it for an equal quantity of dollars.  Bitcoin is not backed by anything.  There's nothing backstopping its value except people's belief it has value as something that can be exchanged for useful things like Lambos.  Its entirely arbitrary.
Two, miners don't set the value, the market does.  I could clone bitcoin and mine a shiny new blockchain on my computer - the value of these tokens is not proportional to the value of my computer.  They're worthless.  Bitcoin has value because the market has decided it has value. To the extent miners affect the price, it's downward.  They have bills to pay, and they pay for them by selling their bitcoin on the market.
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:51:13
"silently?" Um, not really.
Everyone knows the dollar is inflationary.  The fed sets a fucking explicit inflation target.  That's why no one keeps the bulk of their wealth in cash.  If you had $100,000 in whatever stocks the Dow tracks in 1915 (and kept tracking it), you would have about 38 million today - well outpacing inflation.

I haven’t thought this through very well but it seems to me that more efficient miners are *worse* for the environment, since they allow hashpower to be deployed where it would otherwise be unprofitable.
@_date: 2018-03-28 21:43:56
Whether it can become the global currency is a separate question, but this article seems rather confused.  The cost of mining does not set transaction fees or price. The price/difficulty/block reward sets/transaction fees incentivize some certain deployment of hashpower, but this is a largely one-way relationship.
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:21:36
Your conclusion may not be entirely wrong, but your path there is.
Bitcoin does not gain value because a lot of energy is used to run the network.  That *devalues* it because miners have to pay for their operating and capital expenses by selling their block rewards.  But as the block reward dwindles in the future, there's less of a downward pressure on bitcoin's price.
@_date: 2018-03-31 20:26:27
Unless I'm *really* misunderstanding something, it's not possible that you could be making the same amount of BTC on average as you were in january.  Of course, guessing hashes is probabilistic so a short-term average could be higher or lower than the long-term trend.
@_date: 2018-03-06 17:48:23
If we're talking about fiat-denominated price, quite the opposite: the costs of mining suck value out of the system.

Pretty sure bitmain doesn't do anything for altruism.
If they felt releasing high-volume, low-cost mining rigs for retail markets was in their financial interest, I'm sure they would've done it already.  As it is, they seem perfectly happy selling the same rigs they use for their own large-scale mining operations to hedge against price drops or whatever their angle is.

I mean, there's *a* relationship there, but it's mostly one-way. 
A higher price incentivizes more investment in mining farms.  But this doesn't create a backstop to prevent it from falling.   Mining creates supply, but it doesn't necessarily create demand.
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:37:13

Here are, roughly, the functions of money:
Medium of exchange:  very few businesses or people accept bitcoin for payment.

Store of value: depends on the timescale you look at, I guess.

Well, the difficulty would first have to adjust for you to stand a chance of mining anything.  And the difficulty adjustment is adjusted every [some number] blocks (and the rate of adjustment is limited to some constant).  So if there isn't enough hashpower to create blocks regularly, the difficulty wouldn't adjust into the realm of CPU mine-ability for days/months/years.
@_date: 2018-03-12 05:28:06
I think you're getting cause and effect confused here.
The hashrate is going vertical *because* the price supports that investment in hardware.  There's no reason to think the price can't fall below mining profitability.

@_date: 2018-02-12 07:39:24
Well, someone will probably always be mining, but since the difficulty takes a long time to adjust, a sudden plunge in price that renders mining unprofitable might take a lot of hashpower off the network, which could lead to difficulty making new blocks and potentially increase the chance/incentive of a 51% attack.  It definitely seems like a systemic risk but I don't have a good sense for how severe it is.

It will go up if people actually *use* it.  
Sure the government can impose regulations.  How easy they are easy to enforce is another question, but anywhere you have to interface a cryptocurrency with the above-ground business or financial world, the government can impose regulations.
I am not optimisitic about it ever being widely used as a currency (as opposed to a way to transfer payments denominated in fiat), because its purchasing power is so wildly unstable.  I believe this is a fundamental problem with decentralized crypto, because its value is completely floating and provides no means to adjust the supply like a central bank does.  Just the fact that everyone here talks about it like an investment or an asset seems deeply problematic if this is meant to be money.

Well, the only reality in which the bitcoin maximalist utopia is gonna happen is libertarian fantasies, so that's unavoidable.

It's not a "myth" - wasting energy is how PoW works.  You can argue that's a worthwhile tradeoff for securing the network, but it's certainly going to be vastly less efficient than a centralized payment network or a cryptocurrency that doesn't incentive burning so much power on mining.  That's the cost of decentralization.
And if you compare it to Visa/Mastercard/Paypal, you have to account for the fact that these are big companies that offer more services than securing payments, and in a world where paying with crypto is mainstream you will still need companies that interface between the protocols and businesses/users, because people generally expect things like recourse for fraud.

At current difficulty and hashrate, you'd need about 32 Antminer S9's - and this will increase rapidly.
You would have about an 0.001% chance of mining a block for that month if you weren't in a larger pool.
@_date: 2018-03-15 22:18:10
These are all different protocols and require different software implementations (though in the case of Litecoin, it's very similar, they forked the Bitcoin source code, changed out the PoW function and changed some constants... though I imagine the codebases have diverged since then.  You could probably make a client that handles both with mostly shared code).

I think the real draw is that the price has gone up by a couple orders of magnitude over the past decade and made some people very rich.  No one's getting rich by holding gold.  What you're seeing is more gold rush than people parking their wealth into a "safe" asset.
@_date: 2018-03-12 06:25:06
I don't see why the block rate couldn't temporary slow down in the event of a sudden crash, but there's a very healthy profit margin for new ASIC miners right now.

Well, gold is a fundamental type of atom.  Humans find it aesthetically appealing and it's useful for various industrial uses.  This will likely be true for as long as humans are around, so it will always have some baseline value.  I don't think there is anything unique or fundamentally valuable about Bitcoin besides brand recognition and the consensus of a bunch of people, since cryptocurrencies can be created at will and Bitcoin just happened to be the first.  You can stuff gold under a mattress, but Bitcoin doesn't exist without the internet, so you can only ride it so far into the apocalypse in the best case.   Bitcoin's been around for less than 10 years, it hasn't even weathered a serious global economic downturn, so I don't think we can say anything about how it compares to gold as a hedge yet.

In BitTorrent, the problem is very different.  All users (it doesn't really matter who the individuals are) are basically synchronizing to a common state that doesn't change and rapidly propagates through the network.  In lightning, you are sending specific data from one specific user to another specific user (and there are presumably several orders of magnitude more users than your average bittorrent swarm) over a network whose channel state (and thus ability to route payments) is constantly changing.
I don't know enough about routing or lightning to know how serious of an issue this is - but my intuition is that it only matters if the network is truly distributed.  If you're willing to accept a certain number of larger hubs then it seems like a non-issue.

I mean kinda; a verified Picasso or whatever is unique and has some aesthetic/historical significance value anchoring it.  Cryptos are pretty interchangeable and can be forked/minted at will. There's probably a small amount of intrinsic demand for buying stuff on black markets/transferring other cryptos to fiat, and by libertarian ideologues buying stuff in crypto just cause they can, but it's pretty safe to say the vast increase in value in 2017 was pretty much entirely speculative.

And the larger the scale of the bitcoin economy, the larger these companies must be.

Well, one entity isn't.

Of course the distributed miners thing turned out to be a bad assumption, since mining power became very centralized.

Bitcoin’s design assumes a large number of unaffiliated miners.  Unfortunately the economics of mining don’t favor this.  This is probably Bitcoin’s biggest design flaw, security-wise.
Once the network hashrate is dominated by a few large players, many assumptions about its decentralization/trustlessness have to go out the window (though we can still expect they stand more to gain from collecting block rewards and fees than doing anything nefarious enough to break trust in the network).
@_date: 2018-02-09 02:30:38
I'll skip the technical details.  
You contribute processing power to secure the bitcoin network.
Every 10 minutes, a miner is randomly rewarded with a chunk of new bitcoins - thus, "mining".  The chance of a miner getting this reward is proportional to their contribution to the processing power of the network.  Thus, the more miners there are in the world, the less likely you are to get the bitcoin.  At this point, it is not worth it for you to mine bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-02-13 02:02:43
New bitcoins are created every 10 minutes, on average.
However, they are paid out to a random miner (or rather, the miner who solves the PoW, which is random).
You will want to mine in a pool, where the rewards are distributed among the people contributing hashpower to finding a solution.  There's usually a minimum amount you have to mine to get a payout from a pool, so you would need to reach that amount before you actually have bitcoin in your pocket.

Bitcoin is not "backed" by anything.  It has no use value and it represents ownership of no physical assets.  It's numbers in a database that many people have agreed have real-world value.  The fact that electricty and hardware is used in making more of it does not give it "backing".

The same way it works now.

I'm not super knowledgable about all the implementation details so I don't know if I'm missing something, but since mining is inherently based on random guessing and block time is Poisson distributed, unless there's something to stop it, a lucky miner could solve PoW very quickly after the previous block - it just becomes increasingly improbable that someone *doesn't* solve it the longer they try.

Bitcoin doesn't have a security problem - its security properties are well understood and so far have proven to be fairly robust.  It does have a speed/scaling problem, since on-chain scaling is seen by most of the community as a dead end.  Everyone is betting on Lightning/off-chain scaling being the solution - but at present, this technology is at a fairly early stage.
Other coins that take an entirely different approach to the problem, like Nano, *claim* to handle this better, but they have to make tradeoffs somewhere (like weaker/harder-to-understand security properties, no incentives to run nodes, questionable coin distribution), and they just haven't been around very long, or had their scaling properties seriously tested.  With anything security/reliability-critical, like a cryptocurrency system, I'd take old and proven over new and untested.  Bitcoin (and its derivatives) basically takes a brute-force approach to solving the problem, which is inelegant and wasteful but simple and quite secure.

By spam I mean valid transactions that just don't serve any real purpose and would be discouraged if there was a higher fee.  Like, mixing transactions, people sending coins between their own addresses, could be anything really, like miners trying to congest the network to get higher fees.


Well, the blockchain only needs to know the initial and final state of the channel balances.  The intermediate ones only need to be known by the participants, so you could have any number of transactions in between.


It is, but it's a layer running on top of bitcoin.  Anyone can still just use bitcoin as-is.  Opening, contesting, and closing channels requires on-chain transactions.  If we have 300 million people (~ the population of the US) opening a channel at 3 TPS,  it would take about 3 years to clear that through the blockchain with 1MB blocks (if my math is right).

Also, the idea that having some arbitrary fixed supply of money, or having the supply tied to how much metal you dig out of the ground are somehow inherently better systems isn't a claim one can make without justification.  Like all ideological bullet points, you're oversimplifying a complex topic that has been debated for centuries.

"good enough" is when 2nd layer protocols like LN are mature and can replace the bulk of on-chain transactions, and can scale orders of magnitude better than raw bitcoin.  At least if the long-term vision for bitcoin is more wide-ranging than "digital gold".
Segwit and batching by exchanges undoubtedly helps, but the blockchain still only supports single-digit transactions per second, so the skeptics so far have little reason to think severe congestion can't recur.

This isn't what a modern-day bank run would look like.  I don't have the numbers but I assume physical money a branch has on hand is a small percentage of a bank's liquid assets.  People who want to withdraw cash beyond what the bank has on hand might be inconvenienced (since developed economies aren't particularly cash-based, and definitely not for systemically important transactions, the effects of this inconvenience will be very limited), but the bank wouldn't be in any danger.

Well, yes, that's exactly the kind of economically nonproductive behavior a small inflation rate is meant to discourage.  I'm not saying your claim is false, just spurious.  If you were working, your wages rose with inflation.  If you put that stash in diverse investments, they would likely be worth a lot more today even adjusted for inflation.  If you had debts, they became worth less in real terms.
As long as inflation doesn't get out of control, it's not some kind of horrifying boogeyman responsible for the world's economic ills, it's just the cost of keeping the economy moving.

If you make a more efficient asic, the difficulty will just ramp up until only the people with the cheapest electricity will be able to mine profitably and you're back to where you're started.
And Intel isn't a company known for leaving profit margin on the table.  If it's meaningfully more efficient than bitmain's product (and I doubt it would be, since bitmain has been working on this problem for many years and has likely optimized it to where the only meaningful efficiency gain would be from the semiconductor process) it will be priced accordingly.
I mean, it would be good to have more vendors for mining hardware, but it will still ultimately end up in the hands of big mining operations with access to the cheapest power on the planet.

Yes.  If you're statistically inclined, it's a Poisson distribution.


Miners can choose whichever transactions they want but the rational thing is to take the highest fees.


Block reward halvings have happened before - nothing really happened AFAIK.  Since they occur on a set schedule and will be anticipated, it's unlikely they'd cause any meaningful short-term shock.




Depends on the value of the transaction to you and how much you trust the counterparty and miners.  Reversing a transaction becomes exponentially more difficult the more blocks a transaction is buried under.

It can be.  But 1) doing everything on chain results in slow confirmation times, and 0-conf isn't very secure. 2) Doing everything on chain requires storing every transaction in the history of Bitcoin, and if transactions are free/cheap, there's little stopping blockchain spam. If running a full node requires adding half a terabyte of storage a day (and running that through your internet pipes), and synchronizing the blockchain requires downloading petabytes of data, you're pricing out small nodes, and only big companies with big server farms will want to run the network.
(And LN in theory can improve privacy, since you don't need a public ledger of every transaction.)

The nasty thing about money is that this is only true for bitcoin if the entire economy is fiscally disciplined enough to keep all of their money on-chain, and only treat on-chain money as real money.  For example, an exchange could be running at a fractional reserve - you deposit your BTC, they quietly cash out most of your money.  As long as everyone doesn't want their deposits back, that's fine, but in the event of a bank run, the exchange just disappears.

@_date: 2018-04-05 14:49:17
Well, with bigger blocks, you need more data to store every transaction that's ever happened, and more internet bandwidth to shuffle the blocks around the internet (and more CPU power to crunch all that data, but we can probably assume that's not a major issue).  Visa has a peak rate of 65K transactions per second, bitcoin can do about 3-5 right now.  65K is a peak rate that's probably never hit in practice, so let's say eventually we need to handle an average of about 10K... that means the nodes are adding ~3GB of storage every 10 minutes (or around half a terabyte a day), and all of that data is getting transferred around the entire network.  That's not infeasible, but it's also considerable, and will likely price out smaller individual nodes.  Of course, the counterpoint is that bitcoin mining is already very centralized and that "non-mining" nodes have questionable security properties, so...
Another problem with big blocks is that when blocks aren't full, there is very little cost to putting spam transactions in the blockchain forever.  But when blocks are full, it can quickly lead to fee death spirals and unpredictable transaction times.
With an off-chain system like Lightning, you don't need to store every transaction forever, and the whole network doesn't need to know about/confirm every transaction.  Of course, whether it can scale to replace centralized systems and still be decentralized is an open question.  And, lightning still requires some on-chain transactions, and nothing is stopping anyone from also using Bitcoin the normal on-chain way, so if LN becomes widely adopted, blockchain congestion might still be an issue.

10 years is a long time for a technology in the internet age - things like Uber, Snapchat, (perhaps most relevantly) Venmo have exploded from nothing to ubiquitous in the time Bitcoin's been around.  Lots of people know about Bitcoin, they're just treating it as an investment, not a means of measuring or exchanging value.  Which is exactly what you would expect when its purchasing power is very unstable and there is also a strong incentive to just accumulate it and use your slowly depreciating, relatively stable and universally accepted dollars/euros/etc as money instead.  
The predictions you would make from a conventional understanding of the functions of money have so far been true.  I suspect even in this sub, the vast majority of people makes the vast majority of their daily-life transactions without bitcoin - people use bitcoin as money mostly where a strong incentive to use it instead of fiat exists, like darknet markets.  What OP's homebrewed theory of money predicts shows no signs of happening, because the incentives to make it happen don't exist.  It would probably take nothing short of a catastrophic economic collapse to create them.

You don't have to eliminate bitcoin, you just have to drive it sufficiently underground to where no one but crooks can be bothered to use it.  And that's not very hard to do.  Unless you think a working economy is going to do back-alley deals to pay employees and exchange money for everyday goods/services, etc, the government can exert plenty of control.  If you don't pay taxes (in USD), they put you in jail.  If you're a business and you accept bitcoin or pay employees in bitcoin, they shut you down an put you in jail for money laundering.  Shutting down fiat gateways like Coinbase will force people to exchange BTC for cash with sketchy people in parking lots.

Well, to say that the existing system has problems is not sufficient to say that some alternative system can alleviate those problems.  
My point is that *fundamentally* the problem is far more complex/deeply rooted than some specific monetary mechanism, when you're actually dealing with the real world - you can't impose some sort of top-down order on the system that would restrict the wealth and power of the very people who set the rules.  It seems to me that the core of the problem is vicious cycles: it's easier to make money when you're rich and powerful, it's harder to escape poverty when you're poor.  When the US was on a gold standard back during the late 19th century gilded age years, before QE or the Fed, or hell, at most times and places in history when "sound money" was the paradigm, inequality was still off the charts.  The rich and (therefore) powerful will always find a way to create debt, opportunities for rent-seeking, to rig the political system in their favor...

But the degree to which a community is willing to trust/follow the dev team in calling whatever they create Bitcoin or Ethereum is entirely a contingent fact.  It has nothing to do with the technologies or anything fundamental, this has to do with politics. 
Fundamentally, any Bitcoin-like design that is reasonably fairly distributed fulfills Taleb's criteria for "organic" money.  Their mechanics and value is derived from the community of people who buy, use, and sell it.   Vitalik can't push out a change that the community at large hates any more than Bitcoin Core can.

Why would putting it on the blockchain mean they can't lie about the gold they have in reserves?  
But the likelyhood of the US going back to the gold standard seems extremely slim without some catastrophic currency failure.  Goldbuggery aside, the dollar doesn't have a credibility issue that backing it with gold would address.
More likely they'd just make some kind of semi-centralized cryptocurrency with issuance controlled by a central bank.

Before it's confirmed in a block, it's not secure at all.  The sender could just spend those inputs again with a higher fee and send the money to himself.
Once it's confirmed, doing a chargeback would require the attacker to either own a considerable amount of hashpower/collude with miners who do.  But if you're sending a ton of money, better safe than sorry.


No, because the price has went up a lot.  But if the price is steady, miners are already operating at their margins, and the block reward halves, yes, the hashrate would halve too (in the long run).

Artificial scarcity isn't really a good thing, just like artificial excess.  When money is hard to get, you get less investment in business, the economy slows down, people lose jobs, people's debts become worth more, etc.
And ultimately, any scarcity is ultimately "artificial", since money is an emergent phenomenon/social construct.   In the absence of effective regulation, the free market will meet demand for money and you'll have things like Tether and entities lending out off-chain BTC iou's on fractional-reserve, basically like the old free banking days, when you had thousands of small loosely regulated banks issuing their own sketchy money.

Sure, but anyone can see the same exact same signals you're using.
If a strategy is reliable, there's no incentive for the market as a whole to not extract whatever money can be extracted from it and bet it out of existence - and if these signals have reasonably reliable predictive power, someone will quickly magnify whatever capital they have available to bet with.  If TA is based on psychology, it's likely that in any reasonably mature market, the financial industry's collective knowledge about market psychology is already being exploited.

As I understand it, once the LN ecosystem is mature, most of the complexity can be hidden and the user experience will be pretty similar to regular bitcoin.  You set up a wallet and lock some BTC in it (it automatically sets up channels), someone sends you an invoice or you send them yours, and the payment gets routed through the network.
There are some hairy details like watchtowers to monitor for fraudulent channel closures, and having to be online to receive payments, and I don't understand enough of the details of LN to know how easy that will be to hide from the user. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:21:18
My intuition tells me something here is off.   Here's some math:
Let's estimate Bitcoin's current power consumption:
26000000TH/14TH = 1857143 S9's
1857143 * 1.4kW = 2600000kW
2600000kW == 2600MW
2600MW * 8760 hours/year = 22,776,000MWh/year.  Probably considerably lowballed, since it assumes every miner is an S9 and neglects inefficiencies, not to mention altcoins.  And of course in reality the power consumption is not going to stay constant, but which way that'll go is hard to predict.
According to the US government, US-based airlines consumed about 17.7 billion gallons of jet fuel in 2016.  The energy density of jet fuel is about 37kWh/gallon.
17.7E9 * 37 / 1000 (to get MWh) = 654,900,000MWh/year
If my math is right (and I might have goofed somewhere), US airlines burn about 30 times more energy than the Bitcoin network uses in electrical energy.  That's a lot of course, and  one's saying transportation is not a massive pollutant.  But if we suddenly ran out of fuel for cars and airplanes, the global economy would essentially collapse overnight.  If we magically destroyed 99% of the miners and lowered difficulty accordingly, nothing about bitcoin would meaningfully change.

Peer-to-peer payments use some kind of cryptographic signature magic I don't have a very firm grip on, but a counterparty *can* try to cheat by broadcasting an earlier channel state to revoke a payment.  Disputes are settled on the blockchain.  You have some agreed-upon amount of time to detect this fraudulent attempt and dispute it, in which case you provide cryptographic proof of the current state,  which causes the fraudlent channel closer to be penalized for some amount greater than they stood to profit.  I have only a vague understanding of the details, but that's the top-level gist of it.

If laws and regulations on transmitting money internationally didn't exist, it would be trivial matter even using traditional means.  This is true for most of the frictions and annoyances in the traditional financial system.
Bitcoin's solution to this problem is to just ignore the laws.  I can't imagine this will be sustainable long-term - I predict the regulatory burden on bitcoin's fiat gateways will increase the more popular it gets.
@_date: 2018-04-21 07:02:51
Well, there will still be miner fees, so the incentive will be there.
Though I wonder what that means for the security of the network.  It seems like the 51% attack security "barrier" PoW offers is basically a function to the amount of energy usage miner profits can sustain.  Without the block reward subsidizing miners, it seems unlikely that people would be willing to spend the, like, $75/tx fees that could sustain a comparable level of hashpower deployment.

As I understand it, the CB sets a reserve requirement the bank must have, and to make more loans, the bank has to also have more money on hand, which it borrows (from other banks).  The Fed can set how expensive this money is to borrow, and thus set interest rates on loans, which controls the demand.
I don't understand the CB's mechanics super well so someone probably has a better/more complete asnwer.

Those aren't quite unqualified advantages.  The bitcoin network is subsidized by mining payouts.  And those, as per the protocol's design, will decrease.  The time to pay the piper will come.   Exchanges aren't free either.  As for transactions being set in stone, that's clearly not always desirable, and one of the reasons people use credit cards (I wonder how much of the existing financial system would simply wind up getting re-created by free market forces in this brave new bitcoin world?).

Well fractional reserve banking *is* often cited as a scam around these parts: if you have $50K deposited, they might have only $5K of your actual money, and the rest is actually loaned out, though as far as you're concerned, your $50K is still in the bank, ie, they're holding $45K's worth of imaginary dollars, and if there's a bank run and enough depositors try to pull their money out, the whole thing collapses.  Fractional reserve banking existed well before fiat money and central banks and I don't see why something similar (though probably not quite the same) wouldn't be done with cryptocurrency.

Yes, it *is* oversimplified - unless you were just living on your cash hoard for 100 years, you're not 100x poorer.  Wages have risen with inflation.  They haven't outpaced it, and have lagged economic growth, but they've kept up with inflation.  Stock markets, real estate, gold, pretty much any real investments have on average risen faster than inflation.  Inflation eats away your cash/deposits, but it also eats away debts. 
I'm not saying inflation is great and is all upside and that the ability to print money carries no risks, but economists generally think a small amount is healthy for the economy.

Why was it that high to begin with?  There was nothing to justify the crazy spike in value except the usual irrational speculative mania (with some market manipulation thrown in for good measure), and this is what bubbles do when reality sets in.  The hype's died down outside the crytocurrency echo chambers, and people are probably realizing that bitcoin isn't the only blockchain in town and your world-changing technology actually needs to be more useful than whatever it's supposed to disrupt (which isn't to say someone won't figure out the killer app, but so far that's been the stuff of libertarian pipe dreams, not the real world).

I'm certainly no expert so correct me if I'm misusing terminology or otherwise confused, but even if you can't create bitcoins out of thin air like banks can with dollars, they'd still operate at a fractional reserve if they're doing anything other than just sitting on their deposits (and that seems like a very useless bitcoin institution). And it's not like bitcoin would by some necessity be the final word on currency in this imaginary society, if we assume a free market nothing's stopping some other token of value being used with more favorable properties for meeting the demand for credit.
Regardless, that's just an example, the broader point I'm trying to make is that bitcoin is not going to be able to swim against market forces in a free economy.

What is "low"?  What determines this intrinsic price bitcoin should be valued at?

That is the silliest thing I've read all day.

We can put aside that 2+2=4 and say it equals 5, but that doesn't get us very far does it?  The price is set by supply and demand.  If you can get people to buy your $1million bitcoin, then it's a $1million bitcoin.  If you can't, then it's not.

That would destroy the whole central premise of bitcoin's "trustless" security.  That it happened before and there were no issues is not something to be happy about: it means that one of the major assumptions in the protocol's design is seriously flawed.  (and along that line of thought: more computing power in the hands of fewer entities actually makes bitcoin *less* secure).

and now, for the dump....

No.  To put it simply, you already know the answer you need to get from the algorithm, and have to find the input that produces it.  Which is to say, the only useful thing the mining produces is evidence that the miner has done the work.

So are you betting on talking movies, or are you betting on cinerama?
Or alternatively, are you betting on the internet, or Webcrawler?
Hindsight is 20/20, which is why this really doesn't tell you much about Bitcoin.  For every actual big thing, there are a hundred long-forgotten also-rans.

I dont get what people think will stop the free market from simply re-creating all these financial instruments they don't like.  The "financial order" wasn't created by fiat, it exists because there is a demand for its services, and you could loan out imaginary bitcoins (or some other crypto tokens) just as easily as imaginary dollars.

Not in its present form.  I think digital currency has a lot of potential (not to bring world peace or lift the poor out of poverty or create an anarchocapitalist/libertarian utopia, that is, but just to make the world's financial infrastructure more flexible and open to innovation/competition) but Bitcoin's economics dont make much sense to me and it has obvious scalability problems.

Don't worry your little head about silly things like economic logic. The free market's got this.
@_date: 2015-02-06 18:23:57
Maybe.  I wish people would stop saying things like "Microsoft accepts bitcoin".  They accept USD.  Being a middleman in a entirely conventional transaction denominated in fiat does not strike me as a very exciting use for the technology.
@_date: 2015-02-03 03:38:51
That'd be quite remarkable, considering how fraud and scam ridden the cryptocurrency ecosystem has been so far.
@_date: 2015-02-01 18:01:43


If Bitcoin market manipulation is trivially easy and as far as I know, quite legal, might that not fairly be described as a trait of Bitcoin?
