Use OTC, I can DM you details of brokers I have worked with in the past.

Speed is the number 1 reason I don't use BTC to transact (unless it's one off large sums). Privacy is not at issue for 90% of use cases IMO.

If they could time travel backwards to buy BTC cheaply they would go straight to 2010 ;)

The Marshall Islands are not EU/Eurozone members. The worst the SEC can do to an EU company is to prevent US banks from processing it's transactions. As Binance doesn't do fiat/crypto this becomes a moot point.

Domain names are interchangeable. Malta has full sovereignty over .com.mt TLDs for instance. Their local bank is Bank of Valetta, which is not a US bank and counts the Maltese government as it's major shareholder. Whilst employees will not be extradited as long as the crime the are accused of is not a crime in Malta.

You set up an offshore entity and have an OTC broker sell your BTC on your behalf and transfer you the fiat.

My point was that there is nothing stopping them from switching domains to one outside of US jurisdictional reach

Not really, the whole point of OTC trading is privacy

Exactly, miners need to liquidate their BTC at periodic intervals to cover costs and distribute profits. OTC trades allow them to do this without hassling with their bank as they will sell directly to fiat withoue the payment coming from an exchange.

The sellers in this case are usually mining pools. The buyers tend to be family offices looking to build large (~500) BTC positions off market and without having to transact with exchanges (they use escrow/fiduciary firms).
There are also whales buying at - 5% of market, dumping, rebuying and repeating.

The ultimate bullish indicator right there gents.

If the trend from past cycles repeats itself it'll blow past 20k and set an ATH an order of magnitude higher than the previous one. That said 20K will be a significant resistance level.

Here's a good article that explains how it happen's in the "real world":  
Bear in mind that it can also be someone simply placing hamfisted market orders whether intentional or not.

Depends on the order volume at a specific price level. It is possible to place a huge limit order which will cause algos and bots to move their stops, cancel the order, move it again and so on and so forth down (or up) the book.
Only a very small fraction of the market cap will in trade at any given time, so it's not as hard as you think.

There seems to be a good support at 10750 on the daily (on phone so can't give a more accurate point). Place a limit order there to try catch the next test with a SL at 10250, of you get stopped out you can buy again cheaper at the next support.

It doesn't pass a basic sense check.
1. The ROI on time/money/resources deployed in running a sting operation via a darkweb market are infinitesimally small (end users, gram dealers) compared to taking down a major drug operations
2. Three letter agencies don't need to sell drugs on the darkweb to raise funding for covert ops. They ship them as diplomatic parcels.
3. RU has access to a lawyer, if he was set up by a TLA he'd have split his guts via the lawyer
4. TLAs don't leave loose ends. He would have overdosed in a hotel room/got killed in a drug deal rather than gotten arrested and paraded for the press

Readers get bored of a narrative/story line after a while, so news sources (which make their revenue off CPM as models) switch it up periodically to recapture reader attention.

I would posit that it would be easier and more effective to demonise BTC by funding a false flag terrorist attack with it. The general public doesn't really give a toss about some geeks buying their blow online instead of from their local dealer, but terrorism is abhorrent and has much more robust legal frameworks than drug enforcement does.

Centralised exchange in customer support turns out to be incompetent shocker!
Glad the community reached out and helped him recover his funds, it's people like these, who dedicate time and effort into selflessly assisting others that'll make us grow stronger together as a community.

Ross (the founder) used a library pc to access a Gmail account he had used to register a forum account where he requested help to build a dark web market place. Why he remained in the US when running an illicit business of that scale is another discussion.

Can confirm a significant amount of OTC buys going on. Out company has seen a 2000x increase in the past 60 days (and we're just a boutique firm).
