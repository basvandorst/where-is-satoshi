You're welcome to try [AgoraDesk]( We've never had a ticket we haven't answered within 24 hours. I'm talking about a human answering, of course.
If you have a friend who's letting you use their PayPal account you should have proof that it's legitimate, because stolen PayPal accounts are used by scammers very often. Ask your friend for an ID selfie with a handwritten note that includes your username and you'll be fine in case there's a dispute and you haven't charged back.

One way to sort of short something is to buy puts for that underlying asset (i.e. BTC in your case). On [AgoraDesk]( you can respond to someone else's option ad or post your own option ad if you don't see one.

Any reason you're not adding [AgoraDesk]( to your list?
@_date: 2019-10-29 09:40:53
I doubt you'll have luck with that. Rates will always be at a high premium because PayPal is a reversible payment method, very often used by scammers.
Try browsing [AgoraDesk]( and seeing if you can find better offers with other payment methods.

A lot of the activity happens upon specific request, i.e. someone contacts someone else on telegram, they draw up an ad, trade, and remove the ad. 
In any case, it's certainly a relevant link.

He probably accidentally went a couple of decimal points too far in the price formula, it's about x100 the normal price.

You can sell with a higher premium if you want.

LocalBitcoins, LocalMonero etc are already P2P, although centralized. But even if we were decentralized that wouldn't prevent this sort of action by governments. All they need to do is conduct surveillance on a certain peer.
The way to avoid this would be trying to stick to payment methods that don't leave any paper trail, so that even if surveillance is conducted then there would be nothing to present to the court as proof.
