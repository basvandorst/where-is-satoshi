its a fact to say yes ,but if we don't give any opportunity for new ico that do have some legit benefit to the community .Crypto or blockchain will not shows its full potential what can we do with it   
well this is my opinion thou

Normal ,everyone will keep mocking for no reason.Seriously there's no one can truly predict what will happen in cypto  
Personally i think in investing in new ico will be better   
like gcox acm coin ,Zeta ,golem and etc   
at least theirs a chance to earn 200% above profit

bitcoin is too expensive   
example  you brought in around 6400usd (for average price now a days )even bitcoin goes up   
you only profit 40%-70%,altcoin or new ico's like gcox,golem ,etc at least you have the chance to earn like 100%-1000% above in a lower capital   
simple math

Well i think investing in ICO's are better ,if you do your research and luck comes  
easily you can get profit around 150-200% profit

its just my personal perception as i say 
no need to devote me for that 
@_date: 2018-08-20 08:38:15
Why get in something that could only gimme 40%-60% profit when i  can go for 100%-1000%above?

well i don't say that it will be harder to earn if investing in btc or eth ,its just depending what you do with them   
If you are planing to long term invest and hope to earn 500% profit  than no way,if you use it in trading yes maybe you will earn more
