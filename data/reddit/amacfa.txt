It's not immediate, it's a bunch of FUD. The developers will get the capacity up and Bitcoin will be fine. We don't need people spreading drama and putting pressure on the devs to create a rushed solution.

The system is still decentralized bitcoin, and it runs on the first layer.
Lighting runs on top of it, it is completely separate. It’s more like a prepaid debit card.
Stay mad and super critical tho.

Ignoring the storytelling above, this would be a valid solution for people using LN to hop to virtually anyone instantly. 
It’s still good old decentralized bitcoin with a second layer, if your false interpretation hurts you, go somewhere else.

The dump from 8.5k was literally the same thing.

@_date: 2017-12-07 07:01:16
It’s really just people who are upset that a vast majority of people don’t research or even know what bitcoin is. So forgive the snobbyness.
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:48:27
Sure, it’s way easier to add another crypto that eventually won’t scale and needs the same improvements like LN.
Typically, bandaid solutions are always easier than well thought out ones.
Pick an exchanges that doesn’t take shortcuts and implements protocol improvements (Gemini)
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:59:24
It’s more truthful to say that some people are just exhausted from explaining the technical merits versus another coin every single day (or hour!).
Typically these people, including myself, just say ‘shitcoin’ or ‘scamcoin’ because it’s frankly easier to say that than “Well the node count is extremely low on this coin, plus they are private nodes, premined, weak development team with anemic comits to github”....literally everyday. 
One day I had 12 people message me on Facebook about bcash, this was definitely one of those days where just saying ‘scam’ was much easier (and understandable) then explaining technical merits every single time (to people that might not necessarily comprehend).
Moral of the story: Don’t bring the claws out because someone didn’t elaborate, just ask them why, instead of borderline provacative comments like “Bitcoin won’t win the coin race this way, preach hodl”

If you really think bitcoin is affected by news all the time, you’re in for a rough ride.
This is still a bear cycle, each peak lower than the last, but still bouncing off the floor of 5800-6100. 
Look at every bubble cycle in bitcoin, the price slowly leveled out to a flat line, it has never suddenly broken out of a bear market when the price hasn’t yet stabilized from the ATH
Stop clinging to the news to make your trades.

The PFU [Single Lump Sum] is the Minister's preferred option at this time. The proposal to align the taxation of cryptocurrencies with that of precious metals was mentioned, but it is not favorable. He believes that this is a too "political" and "risky" regime, and prefers to guarantee entrepreneurs and individuals a regime in which they can plan for the longer term. In addition, it does not exclude the idea of ​​exempting crypto-crypto exchanges from taxation, but wishes to deepen discussions on tax competitiveness issues in particular, through regular exchanges with the ecosystem, to develop relevant measures and effective.
In any case, he has been very positive and now seems willing to advance the subject. He said in his introductory remarks: "You have with me a total and determined support to change things”.

In the last cycle, it wasn’t until the third test of the bottom until the price finally broke the trend.

\&gt;problem proof verify need zero run find post place gold rely pool
and respective pairings
\- problem proof
\- verify need
\- zero run
\- find post
\- place gold
\- rely pool

I have spent over $500 on Uber in several cities the last few months. It's literally the best service I have ever used. Like Tesla, it's not available in every city because of old fashioned laws that are slowly being worked in Uber's favor. Where it's available, I always use it. 
It's cheaper than a taxi, easier than a taxi, nicer than a taxi. No tipping.  All in one. You get some pretty cool cars, when I was in Dallas I had someone pick us up in a Mercedes ML350!
I submitted my suggestion. If your doing the same, be sure to give an idea how to incorporate bitcoin with the existing structure they use. (Which is linking your card, and paying at the end of the ride automatically) Keep in mind, Uber gets a cut too. 
It would be cool if they could stick a QR in the car that can be used to pay for the ride. Or use bitcoin for optional tips!
@_date: 2014-12-20 23:49:28

Don't lie. I have TD bank and they called me about my coinbase transactions. They said that they *may* have to close my account if activity continued. Their reasons was that coinbase was linked to fraud.
I went in the next day, explained bitcoin to the branch manager, and told them they don't have a right to tell me how I'm allowed to spend my money. If it's linked to fraud, oh well, I'll take my chances with coinbase.
She explained that it should no longer be a problem and then proceeded to ask me about bitcoin with great interest!

”Only 333 more pages(blocks) in the bitcoin ledger until that bitcoin improvement thing (Segwit) we voted on earlier is confirmed and ready to be activated after a delayed period”
A block is a page in the bitcoin ledger containing all the transactions from that period of time. They come every 10 minutes or so. 
Basically - Segwit improves the bitcoin protocol a bit...and at the same time allows for the ‘lightning network’ to be used on bitcoin. The lightning network is a major improvement that requires segwit in order to be implemented, some people are excited about this 
It also doubles the block size, this basically means less fees

Nobody wants high fees. Bitcoin is at the 1993 point of development but with 1998 hype. Wait for improvements, or use another coin. 
But certainly don’t rush improvements that could centralize the whole system, thus devaluing it, or replace brilliant devs with incompetent ones. No no.
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:13:46
You lack vision. Core is a team of talented engineers with a proven track record. Scaling is coming very soon, just not the way you want it. 
Bitcoin will eventually be a foundational dentralized blockchain (backed by trust/security) where mostly settlement transactions occurs. All your ‘coffee’ and ‘t-shirt’ purchases will be on 2nd/3rd layer. You will never be making a single transaction on chain for purchases like you used to.
Be patient or move to another coin. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:13:15
Your prediction is wrong. We’ll hit 9-10k by fork. Then correct to 6-7k. IF THAT. 
Also take money out before fork? Dumb. 
Don’t take advice from this guy. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:38:01
Why would Bcash take over? You’d figure litecoin would be the most logical backup - seeing as more merchants and even some Bitcoin ATM’s accept it.

More lies. Nobody is rejecting it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:01:30
But it’s still just a shitcoin. All the good developers are still on the original chain. No one is actually moving over to BCH.
@_date: 2015-08-13 17:04:47


With lines like this, how can you expect us to take your claims seriously? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:19:05
Anyone upset about transaction fees either uses litecoin or monero. Or just uses a lower fee.

@_date: 2017-11-12 11:52:28
With that logic, 30mb blocks. Every user who wished to run a node would need at least 2 terabytes free
Hard drive space solely for the blockchain. This centralizes and devalues bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:50:31
When I cashed out BCH, it was about 20-25% of BTC value at the time.
Should 2x be the same, and you only own $100 in BTC, you should make about $25 off 2x coins. 
**IF** a correction happens at 10-25%, your loss will be offset by the extra 2x coins you received.
And if no/little correction happens, and you sell all your coins before the fork...you’re going to have a bad time...versus keeping them - you’ll come out ahead.
This is exactly what happened the last time.

IF a correction happens at 10-25%, your loss will be offset by the extra 2x coins you received.
And if no/little correction happens, and you sell all your coins before the fork...you’ll have no 2x, and be forced to buy back your BTC, possibly at a higher price.
This is exactly what happened the last time.

Bitcoin has the best developers. Best infrastructure. Most users.
Quoting **First Mover Advantage** - The first version of an innovation, when adopted, tends to get the most recognition, trust, and adoption. Like Coca Cola, which still sells more than any other, despite there being literally dozens of alternatives. Bitcoin is so far ahead of other currencies in adoption, that it would take an enormous amount of work for others, or an enormous failure on bitcoin's part, for it to lose.
**Network Effects** - this is where everyone is using a thing because everyone else is using a thing. This tends to filter out alternative implementations, and trends everyone to a single thing. Examples are people selling on eBay or Amazon because that's where everyone buys, thus giving you the biggest customer base, and buying on eBay or Amazon because that's where everyone sells because that's where you get the greatest variety and best prices. Same for Google Play Store (which has many unpopular alternatives), dating apps, etc. Bitcoin is the most popular currency among users, because it has the most support from exchanges, businesses, and software developers, who are all flocking to it because it has the most users. Long term trend is for Bitcoin to be the dominant, if not the only, currency, same as every country tends to have only one currency. Having multiple currencies also adds costs from having to exchange between them, and risks of speculating on their relative prices.
**Value lock-in** - This is where you have financial commitment to something that can't easily be replaced. For example, you may have a hard time switching between Apple and Android, because you bought a lot of apps on one that won't transfer to the other. It's the reason businesses still use Microsoft: their computers run Microsoft operating systems, office software, and databases, and it's really costly to transfer to and configure something else. Bitcoin has same effects, where mining hardware, wallet software, merchant hardware, etc all lock you into using that one currency, and make it hard to switch.
**Open source** - bitcoin isn't a company that can fail. It's a protocol that anyone can use and improve upon. If something better comes out, bitcoin can just implement it. People won't abandon it, because of network effects and value lock-in. As long as it's something that provides value, and is a protocol that everyone can use, it will continue to survive. Look at TCP/IP, the SMTP/POP3 email protocol, or Linux. All have plenty of more advanced alternatives, yet we all stick to them and just upgrade them however we can.

● In September 2012 Winklevoss twins gave $250,000 to Mr. Shrem who were supposed to buy BTC for them.
● He gave them Bitcoins worth only $189,000.
● 5,000 missing Bitcoins became the reason of tension between Winklevoss and Shrem.
● "When he purchased $4 million in real estate, two Maseratis, and two power boats, we decided it was time to get to the bottom of it".
●  and their lawyer has stated “Either Shrem has been incredibly lucky and successful since leaving prison, or — more likely — he ‘acquired’ his six properties, two Maseratis, two powerboats and other holdings with the appreciated value of the 5,000 Bitcoin he stole from” the Winklevoss twins in 2012.
● Charlie Shrem also agreed to pay $950,000 as restitution in his plea agreement. If the Winklevoss twins claim is true and Shrem had the bitcoins to purchase these new assets than it would mean he had the money to pay this restitution on time but did not pay it when he had the means to. If it comes to light that he indeed has control of bitcoins and still did not pay the government the money he owes, that could cause a lot bigger problems for him.

It’s almost certain that they agreed to a specific bitcoin price and coin amount, this is always determined before an OTC trade, or at least when the payment was received. It’s likely the article is helping readers understand the amounts at the time by using the phrase “$250k in bitcoin”.
Either Mr. Shrem was intentionally short this specific agreed amount by 5000 btc. 
Or the twins weren’t smart and actually said “give us $250,000 in bitcoin”. It’s likely Mr. Shrem used the full payment to purchase bitcoin, but may waited some time (intentionally or not) and eventually bought in with about 24% (minus Shrems cut) of lost potential coins from the time he received payment, due to waiting the market. I don’t have a graph in front of me, but 15-24% isn’t unheard market volatility during that timeframe. My theory is the twins realized this after the fact, did some calculations and realized they were short.

You’re right and wrong. The bleed doesn’t happen here though. This is similar when we poked $3000 and then hovered at $2900-$2200, even touching below $2000. 
Honestly, it was the longest bleed in bitcoin, and probably isn’t happening this time around. With ETF’s opening up, people messaging me on Facebook, and a Segwit + LN, all the price can do is go up with dwindling supply. Don’t forget, halving is less than 3 years away too. 
You’re right, but it’s more like we’ll hit 10,000+ and bleed down to $5000.
@_date: 2018-11-02 14:50:02
I believe the article implies he came up 5000 BTC short. Which math wise does check out as the price was around $10-13 per BTC at that time. They paid at $12.2 per BTC. 
5000 BTC at that time would yield $61,000, which the amount of loss they were claiming. They received ~15,491 BTC out of ~ 20,491 of the total they were supposed to receive. 
The fact that he *agreed* to a plea, but didn’t pay it is telling of Mr. Shrem — this assuming the Winklevoss twins and the author of the article are being truthful

You don’t make sense. Price will go up as supply dries. It doesn’t matter if they receive less btc from mining. 
2011 with a block reward of 50 btc is like $500-$1000. 
Now the block reward is 12.5, about $92,000
And assuming bitcoin is $100k in 2020 (during 6.25 halving), it will be worth $625,000.
Granted they make less from difficulty increases, but sounds to me like miners are making bank from rewards then ever.

Two weeks ago we were bombarded with pro-XT comments and shouts of censorship. Yes posts were being deleted, but the crowd was clearly towards XT. 
Content of posts were emotionally charged and had no real debate. Anything that wasn't pro-XT two weeks ago got downvoted.
Lots of people from the XT crowd started labeling the other side '1mbers' or 'pro-1mb' as if it were that simple.
So I'd have to disagree, the XT extremist are out there.
edit: grammar

Compartmentalizing an opposing viewpoint as 'small blockist' and then insisting your side is the truth - this is a straw man arguement.
It doesn't matter how many upvotes you fabricate. The community will decide.

It was created to increase transaction capacity by doing something called ‘block size increase’. Unfortunately by increasing blocksize and having all transactions on chain you make it near impossible for the average person to run a bitcoin node. The less nodes in network, the less decentralized the coin — the easier it will be to shut down and/or censor.
BCH/Bcash/Bitcoin Cash took the centralization route which is a short-sighted not well thought out approach to making bitcoin scale to the masses.
Now the only purpose BCH serves is to dilute to bitcoin brand name and confuse users. With comparable fee’s and a maturing lightning network, BCH serves no purpose or advantage. It is inferior, because it is more centralized. 
Unfortunately, some BCH fans and Roger Ver have resorted to outright lying (Labeling BCH as Bitcoin, saying Lightning network is centralized, etc).

**There is no reason for the author not to disclose EXACT reason why Apple rejected the app. He's allowed to do that. He just doesn't want the public to know why it was rejected.** Many developers did it before. Many developers published exact extracts from they communications with Apple with no ill effects. The only NDA Apple enforcing is in regards to using pre-release versions of they software.
Cryptocat has a history of pretty severe security issues, I wouldn't use it even if it was in the app store. 20 bucks says it's a legit reason, *and he's just a whiney bitch.*
Cryptocat is in the Mac App store, so whatever reason it was rejected wasn't some kind of conspiracy, it wasn't about exporting encryption...

Walt saves Jesse.
Walt takes Ricin.
This makes Jesse decide to not kill Mr. White, even though he wants to.
Walt will either turn himself in, or allow skyler to do the honors. (To clear her of charges)
Walt will tell Marie and DEA where Hank is buried.
Walt dies from ricin few days after he takes it.
Skyler will get money from Walt.

Very subjective. And the iPad's and 5S lines beat all android counterparts in speed and performance, without rigging benchmarks scores. Much more stable too.
I see Apple as more ethical than Microsoft or Google to be honest. That's just my opinion. Bitcoiners are just mad because Apple just doesn't allow wallets to be hard stored on iOS yet.

There are wallet apps for iOS. The thing is that people submit these wallets that don't abide to the rules and guidelines laid down by Apple app submission (like storing wallet files). 
It's not like Apple is imposing new rules to be anti-bitcoin. These are rules that have been in place for a while. If anything, Apple will modify them to support Bitcoin once they see that there is demand and legitimacy in it. And so far with the whole overstock.com deal, we may see that very soon.
