They do agree, they're proposing a change. Just like Core is proposing Segwit.

I think it's best to assume that I have no idea how the low level stuff works. Conceptually I knew all of what you said, but I don't want to assume knowledge if it will make me misunderstand it.
For context, if you'd like, [this]( is the project I'd be using it in. I'm certainly trying to emulate the bitcoinj/LN model, but beyond that I only have knowledge of it at a high level.

How do you measure consensus when the only vote being held is by the miners?
@_date: 2015-12-27 09:56:40
Clearly they've already gotten you to use the false definition. 
@_date: 2015-12-08 19:44:52
Except on the thread asking what was wrong, where the mods changed default sort to controversial.
@_date: 2015-12-07 19:11:30
Considering that it has not instigated a hard fork, and even at the Jan 11 trigger it will still only be a proposed hard fork, I'm really not seeing your logic.
@_date: 2015-12-18 03:17:24
Yup. Let's just pretend there wasn't a large backlog on Black Friday, that the average block size isn't 800+kB, and that Overstock didn't just say they wouldn't use Bitcoin for their stock program due to lack of throughput.
@_date: 2015-12-08 15:55:56
How feasible do you think my [current project]( is? I haven't hit any show-stopping problems yet, but if one is foreseeable I'd like to know early. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 20:35:23
And if it weren't actively suppressed, it might be easier to resolve so people can shut up about it.
@_date: 2015-12-07 20:31:49
Also, what makes this different than when Bitcoin Core instigates a hard fork?
@_date: 2015-12-08 00:05:09
Okay, then going by a different metric, XT is ~10% of nodes. This would make it seem to have more, not less, support. You're undermining your own argument.
@_date: 2015-12-08 15:52:21
No, they have consensus from the miners who trigger them. The miners' consensus is used as a proxy for the community, because there's no way to measure community consensus directly. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 20:40:47
Again, can someone please explain how a fork that only activates if a supermajority of miners agree is hostile?
@_date: 2015-12-08 00:08:03
If 75% of miners agree on it, that's a pretty good indicator that it's no longer contentious. You start your argument from it being in the minority, state that it would then be in the majority, and then act again like it's in the minority.
@_date: 2015-12-27 03:02:31
Which is obviously why you've overcensored this sub so much
@_date: 2015-12-14 07:02:25
The problem is, again, how does the node determine if it's spam? You can't just say "This is only in regard to spam" without specifying how spam is determined, and whether the end user has any way to tell if it will be marked as spam.
@_date: 2015-12-17 17:28:35
And it doesn't exist yet. I don't like banking on solutions that don't exist without attempting to scale before then.
@_date: 2015-12-07 20:33:26
The posts display as zero here because the scores are hidden. If you check your comment history you see the real score. Not sure if this is a bug or not, though.
@_date: 2015-06-06 04:44:44
Honestly, I don't know for sure. It's more likely to creep into the mean than anything else, since the median is usually going to be the default. 
But if you think of it like bicameral legislation you get an idea of what I'm going for. The median is much more resistant to change, but when it does its too forceful. The mean is very easy to change, but tends to not do so quickly enough. Combining the two measures would provide more stability. 
Edit: I can crunch the numbers if you'd like, but I'm not in my home state right now, so I'd like to wait until I'm in front of a real computer with wifi instead of cell data. 
@_date: 2015-12-08 17:11:46
Except when mods will change the sorting method per-thread, this becomes a problem.
@_date: 2015-06-04 19:49:10
This opens the blockchain up to potential spam attacks, and at the same time may not respond quickly enough to changes in user base. 
@_date: 2015-12-17 00:44:51
Oh nice. This thread is sorted controversial too. Great job, mods.
@_date: 2015-12-07 19:27:10
I'm not, but that doesn't change that the activation threshold is well into supermajority territory. At least at the moment, XT is an altcoin in the same way that btcd is an altcoin. 
So can you please explain how an untriggered hard fork can make XT an altcoin?

SegWitness does not make it exponential. It just means that each block will be `blocksize += x * s` instead of `blocksize += x`.

I'm only citing arguments. I don't think it would be right for me to judge their validity, only show the counterarguments.
This is part of why I need help. I'm in favor of the increase, so I don't want to be the only voice shown.

@_date: 2015-12-27 09:55:54
You're an idiot if you think miners don't decide what's valid. That's literally their job. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 20:28:24
I can and am. Certainly at the moment they are using a common ledger. Currently XT has ~1% of blocks. This is nowhere near the required threshold for forking, and it's unlikely that it will get there anytime soon. You're being intellectually dishonest to imply otherwise.
@_date: 2015-12-08 06:49:15
Specifically a micropayment channel. I understand some of how it works, and I'm willing to do quite a bit of legwork, but I don't know where the best starting point is.

Except this breaks when the mods will change the sorting to suit their message.
@_date: 2015-12-08 17:09:56
Or, like most of us, they have a genuine interest in making bitcoin and its surrounding community better.
@_date: 2015-12-07 19:08:18
Also, you can't minimize it.
@_date: 2015-06-09 02:20:24
Two clarifications, if I may. 
1) the pro side doesn't say the impact on nodes will be fixed later, they say that the impact won't be immediate *and* there are already some scaling solutions (though not enough to get 20x more efficient). 
2) many in the con side do not support an increase at all. I would say that the quiet majority support a smaller increase, but you would be remiss to not include this third camp. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 19:59:30
Getting away from this philosophical debate, do you mind if I ask your opinion on something?
@_date: 2015-12-17 17:54:07
And putting a hard limit on something make it impossible to scale it. Yes, we need to make the code more efficient, but when there's a hard cap, you can't make *that* more efficient.
@_date: 2015-06-10 15:37:46
Well shit. 
@_date: 2015-06-26 18:07:10
There isn't a need for a limit, there's just no way to fully remove it.
If you remove the hard cap, the next issue you run into is the messaging protocol. The maximum it's capable of sending is 32MB.
Sure, you could alleviate that by sending header-only blocks to initially propagate, but that delivers a bunch of problems of its own. You could also divide each message that's sent into several components. Unfortunately, these are all much harder changes than merely removing a cap.
@_date: 2015-06-04 14:03:27
Then you change voting incentives, and reduce protection against a spam attack (not that I think one is likely). You make a system under a 4x vote where it takes 75% of the network to lower the limit, when it could well be that it needs to be lower. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 06:48:48
I'm mostly posting for tips. 
That said, what do you think a good application for bitcoin would be, that's potentially easy, and that we haven't seen yet. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 18:26:58
It's very easy to soft fork a lower limit though.
@_date: 2015-06-22 07:46:08
Would you be willing to do one which shows and connects transactions together, by wallet path, rather than location?

Deleted several times. I posted one. I know others did as well. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 04:46:09
True, but it does make things more granular. At the moment you need to choose between 0 confirmation-minutes and 10 confirmation-minutes. Allowing the level of security to be more granular could allow for faster payment processing if merchants are waiting on confirmations. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 06:07:30
There's normally a cap on how many free transactions a miner accepts. It's safe to assume at least some portion are paid. 
@_date: 2015-12-19 07:12:49
Probably just an API glitch. Looks like it went down to zero, so there's a chance that it was simply unreachable and they handled it poorly.

No. Iceland regards it as a currency, and it's therefore ineligible for VAT. 
@_date: 2015-06-03 07:41:28
Will do. These will likely be arguments 2 and 4 (trying to evenly space pro and con). 
@_date: 2015-06-05 23:32:40
Mean + median will make the size more dynamic, and will prevent attacks that could make blocks almost empty.
@_date: 2015-06-08 00:25:09
While I have your attention, can I get your opinion on our WIP [blocksize debate summary]( I know that I'm forgetting some arguments to flesh out/put in.
Edit: I ask not to bait you, or anything, but because you've stated you are neutral on the debate, and I desperately need a third opinion.
@_date: 2015-06-07 23:34:15
Tell that to the hard drive companies that have been doing this for basically ever. They're the ones that forced this on us.
@_date: 2015-06-04 04:43:58
Using 1 day allows to compensate for usage change rapidly. For instance, there's a hell of a lot more volume on Black Friday than Thanksgiving. You'd like the block size to respond to that so full nodes don't have to deal with a bloated transaction pool for as long. 
Edit: *more* rapidly. There'd definitely be some problems with Black Friday, specifically. Especially if offchain solutions (such as lightning networks) aren't used. So yeah, not a perfect solution, but it works for mild fluctuations. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 21:40:00
Actually, yeah. I don't use it often, but when I do its for their warranty, or to see if they have some random adapter/tool, since RadioShack closed. 
The staff at our local one are fairly knowledgeable. I know that's not the case in many others. 
@_date: 2015-06-08 05:43:28
I definitely think that the counterargument is stronger here, but it is an argument that I've seen used, so I feel obligated to include it. The current state of things are unfortunately susceptible to these sorts of attacks, given enough funding, and I doubt we will find a way to stop either.
@_date: 2015-06-04 05:23:09
Using too large of a multiplier opens the network up to various attacks, such as, in a 4x multiplier it would take only 25% of the network to raise the block size. In a 2x system it takes 50%.
A slightly more elegant solution might be to use median + mean. 
@_date: 2015-12-08 00:02:47
But not when it's first posted. I think this is a glitch.
@_date: 2015-12-08 15:07:51
Yeah, bullshit. Bitcoin has triggers for forks all the time. Usually it's soft, but even so. 
@_date: 2015-12-08 00:06:59
I really have to disagree with you. It does currently have a dictator, because there is one head developer on one accepted implementation. Even if I accept that Mike is trying to be dictatorial (which I'm not sure is true), I still have to think that it's better to have two people vying for power than one.
@_date: 2015-06-29 07:51:28
Let's be honest, everyone is kicking the can down the road. That's the only thing we can do until we can come up with better solutions. 
Edit: current potential solutions:
1) get much faster block propagation (to allow for larger sizes). 
2) decrease block time (1 is prereq) 
3) off chain third parties :(
4) co-mined sidechains
5) Lightning Network (and similar hub/spoke arrangements) 
Did I forget any? 
@_date: 2015-06-08 17:04:41
I get it! It's a bear! 
@_date: 2015-06-26 14:04:51
Oh gosh... I did not mean to type what I typed. Thanks for the save. 
@_date: 2015-06-06 02:04:05
It would need the majority of hashpower, but unlike a 51% attack this would not need to be coordinated. Many miners already mine empty blocks immediately after getting one. There are also miners which do incredibly small blocks. I believe there were some who did 240kB ones. So they would need much less than 51% to have a dramatic effect on the block size. I haven't looked at recent stats, but I would estimate it at closer to 40% to get near-zero, and 25% to get a large bottleneck. 
Using the mean as well doesn't help too much, but it does mean that some more proactive miners can have a more effective defense, especially if the default is raised to 1+ MB
@_date: 2015-12-08 15:10:23
So there's no difference? Both of these changes require rather broad consensus. 
@_date: 2015-12-08 16:48:18


I think you're misunderstanding, but it could be me who is. This is meant to be a sort of marketplace for people to volunteer their CPU time in exchange for small rewards. The pool model doesn't really work because not everyone is working on the same problem. Likewise a lot of proof-of-work models won't work correctly because there's no easy way to make that generalized. So instead people are purely being paid for their time on valid work. The rest of the document details how valid work is determined and how requests for work are handled.


This isn't for proof-of-works. This is for work requests.


How would the user change their code? The person at the other end would be able to have that print anything they wanted, and short of analyzing the application sent over, you won't be able to determine what that print will be. The standard part of that is the flag, which basically says "Forward the next line to the server".
@_date: 2015-12-14 07:12:32
It's a tangent that you brought up.


@_date: 2015-06-03 23:25:07

Those extra layers are certainly going to be useful though. Never doubt that.
@_date: 2015-06-26 03:13:37
There was one point where they had to roll back all transactions *from within a short period* due to a protocol bug.

Volume. And miners will selectively include transactions if they need larger fees per size.
@_date: 2015-06-03 08:20:40
No. The idea is to highlight arguments that are currently being used, especially by developers. 
That said, I thought I put in there that LN was unimplemented. I did do that, right? 
@_date: 2015-12-08 15:09:01

@_date: 2015-12-18 20:18:13
If I may be so bold as to speak for the group (I don't, but why not), compromise is always good. In the end, many will prefer 101, but I don't think anyone will be foolhardy enough to not go for *something* as opposed to *nothing*.
That said, I would much rather it increase by a percentage than a fixed amount.
@_date: 2015-12-07 19:49:50
Except the fork is only triggered when a majority of miners agree that that's what bitcoin is. So I'm still not seeing your reasoning.

This thread is a fairly good example, actually.
The default sorting was changed on this thread. Under `controversial` (what they changed it to) the top comment is the bottom for `best`, `top`, and `hot`. They also hid every score and disabled minimizing for below-threshold comments. Not just default minimization, but minimizing at all.
I won't argue that there are many better points made here. This is largely true. But I would rather deal with something that's a little wonky than something that's actively suppressing debates.
@_date: 2015-06-29 04:37:48
Nobody is saying that it's vaporware. What we are saying is that we need a short-term solution sooner, so that we can work on a long term solution. It's disingenuous to phrase the debate otherwise. 
@_date: 2015-12-27 03:03:57
That wasn't an actual proposal (unless it's changed since I last read it). It was a summary of the conference that they called a proposal, and it wasn't signed by a third of the core contributors.

Yes, you can change it, but that doesn't change that it's not exactly benevolent of the mods.
@_date: 2015-06-04 20:49:22
Problem is I don't know the area anymore. I haven't lived here for a while. 
@_date: 2015-06-26 22:12:14
We probably could, but if you change the message protocol, it institutes an immediate hard fork. There's no easy way to get consensus on that significant of a change. It would be far easier to send blocks larger than this in multiple chunks. 
But of course, that's also a hard fork, because previous versions would not be able to receive blocks in this format. 
The message protocol limit is a much harder nut to crack than just lifting the hard limit from the protocol. 
@_date: 2015-06-03 06:38:54
He's spent much more time than I researching lighting networks. If you think it's a bad argument, make an issue about it on the main fork, because at least with this issue, I'm unqualified to show its validity. 
@_date: 2015-12-14 07:16:22
But this is the same argument we have every time. You can't just say that all "non spam" transactions should make it in, without providing users a way to know if their transactions are considered spam. Otherwise (especially given the priority space disappearing) they'll see their transaction unconfirmed for days, not know why, and give up on the system. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 23:51:34
If you find yourself with extra time from the other suggestions, give some feedback for [my project](
@_date: 2015-06-04 18:07:13
I didn't see the 2.5x part. I actually suggested that one a while back. 2:3 vote to raise size seems about right to me. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 03:31:22
Correct. The largest message the protocol can send is 32MB. To increase the limit would require significant changes, or perhaps some system like IBLT could be used to minimize messages. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 20:16:43
Because there's little-to-no evidence to suggest it won't, and lots to suggest that it will. And even if it doesn't, this is a *limit*, not a *requirement*. Under an ideal situation, we wouldn't bump into the limit at all.
Edit: Also, if we need to go slower, that's a soft fork, just like imposing the limit in the first place was.
@_date: 2015-12-27 10:04:53
And defining it as "whatever one or two developers want" is any better? More implementations means people can vote with their feet an which version of the protocol they like. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 00:57:37
You forget there are two types of spam transactions. You describe the more likely one, but the one the anti increase camp cares about is artificially increasing the size of the blockchain.

@_date: 2015-06-04 05:48:52
Already thought of that, hence my edit. Also, I was picturing a sliding scale calculated per block. I believe that's what others were referring to as well. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 20:52:40
Nowhere in there does it say that there will be a fork regardless of consensus. Nowhere in the BIP 101 proposal or the BitcoinXT implementation of it does it say this.
I also don't understand how someone writing *another client* is tantamount to having a dictator for Bitcoin, anymore than Bitcoin Core having a single leader is. If anything, having multiple implementation makes it significantly less likely that any one person can become a dictator of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-04 21:36:04
Nobody deserves that. It's happening, but still. 
@_date: 2015-12-27 03:17:00
Not necessarily. Even if they do manage to get the limit raised, I'm still hoping that too much stress isn't put on the system. 
 
We both know that Bitcoin can theoretically handle more load, but I'm glad there's conservative faction going against that, even if they are being underhanded about it. Caution is good sometimes.
But again, I think not doing it is dangerous. 
@_date: 2015-12-08 00:20:21

They found that among other things, sending a letter saying XX% of British people pay taxes, and giving people a choice where a portion of their funds go increased the payment rate significantly.

Maybe it'll force people out of artificially inflating their units on transmission speeds. Mb/s != MB/s. Pisses me off. 
Also, I'd love to see people adopt that binary prefix that's been going around. It locks to jumps of 1024 instead of 1000, so hard drive people can't be intentionally vague. You would say ki*bi*bytes instead of ki*lo*bytes.

Bull. I live in a town of similar size. There's no way your town uses less than that.


That's a comparison of 261,900 kW \* 24 hours \* 365 days (2,294,244,000 kWh) versus 4800 kWh \* 30000 (144,000,000 kWh). That's without giving bitcoin any benefit of the doubt, or any other advantage. Your small town ~~(and mine by more, thanks to the iron mine) uses more than 20 times~~ about one sixth of what the entire bitcoin network uses. 
~~Edit: and even if you assume that it fits under the "small house" definition for every household (which wouldn't include businesses or governmental functions), you're still off by more than a factor of five.~~

Alright. My two complaints about that source are 1) they don't take into account that 20% of the world's energy is renewable, and I believe that number is higher for nuclear. And 2) atms are idle most of the time, coupled with the fact that it still doesn't compare it to a relevant unit set (kg CO2/transaction), you could easily figure that including every POS (which is essentially what they compare it to) the rate might be higher for traditional banks. But again, we don't have data on that. 
So while I totally agree that some people on this sub are crazy, that number still has no basis for comparison. For all we know that's an improvement. 
Edit: by my math that makes it ~32kg CO2, at a 67.7% fossil fuel energy rate (which is the worldwide average according to Wikipedia). Not a huge improvement, but still.

My biggest concern is on number 2. I knew a fair bit on most of the rest, even if I didn't necessarily know the terms to use for it, but it seems to have two problems to me:
1) 10% (the rate you described) is almost certain to make the bank collapsed under a bank run. If they use that number I really *would* want to listen to the girl. 
2) If most of this money is stored digitally, and they have security on pay with, say, eBay, then what's to stop them from getting hacked? 
2b) or, for that matter, manipulate the money supply (ie, claiming that have $2,000,000 more than they actually have)? That would create money without a loan, or, for that matter, going towards any necessary function. It could do as she says and "line their pockets".

I have learned three things so far:
1) we certainly agree that cynicism towards the government is good and healthy 
2) we have fundamentally different understandings on debates. Ie, I believe it's easier to criticize than propose an alternative, because reality rarely suits everyone. You believe that because your alternative is unplannable (and therefore unexplained in full), that defending the obviously flawed reality is easier. 
3) you care a great deal more about convincing me than I care about defending a situation I already disagreed with. You certainly care more than I do while sick, and therefore less tolerant to walls of text. 
Does this sum up what we have so far? 
I'm perfectly willing to continue, if you'll allow for both of us to shorten our responses. It's difficult to respond to 5 points through a headache.

Hi! Thanks! 
@_date: 2014-11-26 23:36:55
You misunderstand my point, I think. I am not saying that our government is well-managed, or even good at its job. I am saying that there are some things that a free market may not be able to provide. The highway system, for instance, would probably not exist. The same with GPS, and the space missions as a whole. TOR would have been at the very least significantly delayed. 
For all its flaws, it seems to me that government is *currently* a good thing. It wouldn't take much to convince me otherwise, given our current lack of any leadership whatsoever (on both sides), or general intelligence, but the people under them are still making good things happen. 
And while there is no counter-state to compare it to, except in places too far-removed to be a just argument (ie Lybia), it does seem to be a *slight* net plus from where I'm sitting. 
I'm aware these are (at least here) unpopular views, but this is the sort of thing that happens when you are too Libertarian to be a Democrat, but to Democratic to be Libertarian. 
Edit: also, your style of writing is actually quite nice. It reminds me a bit of the meandering style that I often go to. Usually accidentally, but it seems to work most of the time. 
Edit 2: I get there was sarcasm. I'm now responding to the debate that you asked for. It's kinda hard to gather evidence in favor of something so widely perceived that nobody questions it though.

For me it's the customizability. I would prefer to use Linux, but there's not enough overall support for it. And while Apple has a huge advantage in that it controls hardware and software, I enjoy the ability to nitpick over every individual feature. Most people aren't like me. 
As for the phone &lt;-&gt; computer integration, Windows &lt;-&gt; Android is definitely behind. Text messaging is trivial through a third party app, but calls are nearly impossible unless you're connected over Bluetooth. Even then it's a pain. 
The one feature I have managed to get working is that if my computer is unlocked, it disables the security on my phone/tablet. The tablet and phone also do this to each other, but I've found its impossible to disable security automatically in Windows (to my knowledge). 
So yeah, there's advantages to both systems. I feel that my use case is more suited to the balance of support and customizability that Windows offers. If there were good automation and customization tools for Mac, I would easily consider switching. But even then the price is higher, and it's more difficult to repair yourself. 
I dunno. That's my situation. I do commend you for keeping it civil though. 1000 bits.

For those of us who are less educated, can you explain which points are wrong? If I'm being given misinformation, I'd at least like to know which points to ignore. 
Edit: also, couldn't the money supply increase via deflation? Your example seems flawed, in that having a better crop rotation system would merely reduce the cost per plant that they raise (or increase quality), which would effect supply. If demand stays the same, then the price would go down. I know that this is basic economics, and there are probably more complicated mechanisms involved, but I don't know enough to determine which they are. So I'd really appreciate an explanation.

My idea is a proof-of-storage lottery. 
Each time a miner makes a new block, they poll all the nodes they're connected to, asking for the hash of a random previous block, and a random string. If the node doesn't return a result in a certain amount of time (based on ping) , they're rejected. 
And you could even weight ipv6 connections more heavily, to try and encourage network growth on that front.

Just like with any other. The longest chain is the most valid. 
And besides, in the situation you described there would be no fork.
* the largest contributor of each pool is chinese
* China loses internet
* each pool decreases in power by a similar amount
The only pools that *would* go down are the ones in China, but that would only slow transactions down, not fork them, because odds are China would shut down the *whole* Internet, not just the stuff outside the Great Firewall.

Okay, so as for the currency (little b), people say that it has anonymity because they're using the wrong word. It has inherent *pseudo*nymity, meaning that you are known by various aliases, rather than your name. Much like here. Used properly this can translate to anonymity, but it rarely is.
Your assets are "stored" in client programs called wallets. There are quotes around the word stored because that's not actually what they store. What they hold is called a private key. The way it works is that when you wish to send a transaction, you need to sign it with your private key. Anyone who knows your public key (which is part of your address in most cases) can decrypt that message. This is called asymmetric (or more commonly public-key) encryption.
Bitcoin (big B) handles all of the various transfers in two ways. First, it propagates transaction requests throughout the network, first verifying that they meet certain conditions (ie, the requesting address *had* the money, the private key was valid, etc). Second, specific clients (called miners) will attempt to include these transactions in the blockchain, in a large package called a block (hence blockchain).
The way they do this is relatively complicated, but the shortest way to explain it is that they are given a function to perform on that block and a given number. They need to keep plugging in numbers until the solution has a certain number of leading zeros. This number adjusts to the strength of the network in order to keep block times stable. You'll commonly see this number referred to as the "difficulty", though I'm not entirely sure how it correlates with the number of leading zeros.

@_date: 2014-12-14 06:02:15
It's not entirely necessary to understand the network as long as you understand how to secure your own end. That's the larger issue involved.
With banks and whatnot the malicious hackers have an incentive to go after the relatively lax store security, where you can get troves of data at once. For the bitcoin community, there aren't many situations where that would be feasible, so there's a larger incentive to go after individual users.
Most people who use normal, non-insane security measures end up fine, but the basic guidelines are:
* *always* make sure *you* control your private keys
* if you're going to use a web wallet,
    * enable 2-factor authentication
    * set all security to maximum
    * don't use the web wallet at a public computer
* don't keep money on exchanges
* don't keep money on exchanges
* seriously, don't keep money on exchanges

Correct number is 2,294,244,000 kWh. That's about 6 times your town's consumption. My apologies for the error.
Edit 3: I do think that there is something to say for economies of scale, though. The Bitcoin network does not do much in the ways of volume yet, but as that changes I would imagine that transactions become more efficient. Specifically when the block size limit is raised.  That's just speculation though, and so it shouldn't be taken seriously.

Bitcoin can be thought of as two parts, the currency (little b) and the network (big B). 
The currency is essentially marks on a ledger, just like at a bank. And just like with normal currency, the market decides it's value, and user-end security is a major concern. 
The network is very complicated. Basically, it keeps the ledger up to date on all connected machines. It does so because while it's difficult to add to the network (basically a mathematical lottery of guess-and-check), it's relatively easy to verify that the information is correct.

Iirc, it means an individual confirmation is worth less, but per unit of time it's slightly stronger (assuming equal orphan rate). 
You make a tradeoff here of more granular confirmation\*minutes for slightly less efficiency. If we could have a serious research proposal into how that loss of efficiency plays out in various conditions, we might *start* to have consensus on a new block time.

I get the idea of opportunity costs, but it seems unlikely to me that private entities could organize as large a corporation among scientists as some government programs have. While I think that we will always have some SpaceXs, private road makers, etc, I worry about the lack of public input (little is better than conceivably none). For instance, who's to say that we *would* get a highway system. After all, we went 60 years without one. It is completely conceivable that it wouldn't have happened for another few decades.
Also, TCP/IP was made at a public university, something which would not be possible under your system. 
Like I said before, it's difficult to argue about something so pervasive that it include almost all advancements. And it's difficult to say that bitcoin was entirely a private development because it relies on several publicly funded technologies. These things have been so entangled that it's nearly impossible to argue. 
For every Iraq/Afghanistan, you have public education. For every corrupt bureaucracy, you have the national power grid(s). For every bit of bloat, you have lean muscle. 
You can certainly see why you would have the "unfair advantage" in this debate. You can point out probabilities, while I have to defend reality. The same thing happens in government itself all the time. 
Edit: and I'm not "beginning to see". I've felt this way for some time now.

So, if I'm understanding correctly, you would have us establish an ~~Arc~~ [Koorde] (  database of Blockchains.
Thats... a really cool idea, actually. It would require many more nodes than we have to keep it stable, but it would be very cool. 
You could even specify what portions you want to take. So, if we're looking at this from a~~n arc~~ koorde point of view, there could be X sections (hash functions), and you could specify that you want to have N functions, so your node would process N/X blocks, where X[0:N-1] is decided based on what your peers have. 
You would still receive and relay all transactions, but you wouldn't store the full copy of each chain. Maybe a headers only copy, or a pruned copy. 
This might have serious potential. 
\*typically defined as a skiplist of peers with hashtables, and a hashtable of your own. The skiplist is incremented by powers of 2, and is of size log2(n).  It allows you to find any dataset within Olog2(n), iirc 
Edit 2: making sure definitions are clear. 
X = total subdivision of blocks (based on block hash % X) 
N = requested number of sections of blockchain
X[i] = an individual section of the block chain, defined based on the least common section of your peers, and your peers' peers. 
n = total number of peers (normally), but in this case is equal to X, since it's more like a RAID 0+1 than it is like an ~~Arc~~ Koorde (in this respect).

According to a comment above, it simply means that merchants don't need to pay taxes on the bitcoin used in purchase.  This needs to be said because you can think of it as three transactions. 
For instance, a merchant could sell furniture for bitcoin
* one transaction of furniture for bitcoin (bitcoin being currency)
    * the "receipt" is considered the market value of said bitcoin, and tax is owed by the customer on that ammount
* one transaction of bitcoin for furniture (furniture being currency)
    * the "receipt" would again be considered the bitcoin's value, but no tax is owed on this, because the third transaction:
* one transaction of bitcoin for dollars (dollars being currency)
    * allows you to think of the transaction as having occurred in dollars, so those rules indirectly apply.
Now, I did some extrapolation there, so I might be wrong, but that seems to be what's going on.

Why would they? The game theory is very simple here. If you're mining, you know these blocks have little chance of acceptance. So you don't waste the money making them.
If you're a node, doing this would increase inflation, making your holding worth less. So you wouldn't waste your money doing it.

While I do agree with you, there are some reasons to avoid overly large blocks. 
My personal favorite, using California and New York as an example, is that if you have to pay some sort of tax for mining, it would be nice if blocks were small enough to propagate through TOR quickly. You don't want to penalize people for their government's actions.

Glad to see this. 
I admit I've been behind on the mailing list, and even then only joined it recently, so that may be some of my misunderstanding. 
But to the public eye much of this seems still to be hypothetical. If you want to convince people there needs to be some kind of small-scale campaign about it, similar to how Gavin has done his. 
Yes, the mailing list is transparent, but most can't be bothered to subscribe to it. 
With all of that said, what if this risk could be mitigated via a scaling algorithm of sorts. I know Gavin proposed 2x median (or mean?) block size at one point. There was also some stuff tossed around about bitcoin*days destroyed. While I understand that this puts more power in the hands of miners, it still seems to me the best "solution" thus far. 
On the other hand, any algorithm that makes the current situation worse is unacceptable, and they all provide additional complexity. I would like to see how it fares when max size is 2.5 * median(144 blocks). This would put pressure towards larger block sizes, but not by much (takes 3:2 vote to decrease size). It would also put today's max size at ~1MB (if I remember the stats correctly). Since blocks are not always full, this appears to be correct-ish behavior, and it would adjust itself to large influxes, such as a price spike or stress test.

Honestly though, how are lightning networks supposed to be less centralized? Everything I've heard points towards them being much more expensive to maintain than a full node (even at 20MB). Wouldn't this just channel payments towards fewer parties? 
@_date: 2017-02-09 16:28:23
The worst case in that only your node is fooled. It would require coordination to get any significant part of the network to join you, and even then, there'd be much less hashing power working on it, so blocks would take a long time to get a difficulty adjustment.

I'd rather just not have Bitcoin be hijacked with a different vision. I'll move to one that supports that vision if I need to, but the current plan forward for Bitcoin directly conflicts with its whitepaper.


The attack was that you could make a network-crippling block for a couple bucks. This would now take several thousand. If we had pegged it so that as the attack grew more difficult, the restriction on the network was lessened, this would have been much better for the network as a whole.
The alternative is the current situation, where anyone with a couple bucks can spam the network to death for a day or two, and where natural growth will soon overtake this limit if nothing is done, if it hasn't already.


Because this reflects both what the network needs and what it can handle. You know the network can handle it because the miners have an incentive to not cripple the network, and you know the network needs it because miners have an incentive to not create larger-than-needed blocks (due to orphan pressure).


No, they've just listed no reasons that make sense to me. If I recall correctly their argument is:
* The network can't handle it (since proven false, and bandwidth can be reduced further with thinblocks, which they refuse to implement)
* We need a fee market (I could go on for a while on why this doesn't make sense, but there isn't enough room right now)
* It was intended to be this way (false)
* We have better solutions (debatable for SegWit [I would rather it be a hard fork, as it's simpler and cleaner. I also don't like that it subsidizes some data over others], false for LN as it won't be ready in time, and should need to compete with the Bitcoin protocol anyhow, rather than being pushed instead of it)


I'm not saying that the market as a whole is planned, I'm saying Bitcoin has transitioned into essentially a planned economy.
@_date: 2016-03-05 18:53:47
That's what the block size cap is. There is no evidence to suggest core is working on scaling Bitcoin, because they haven't released anything relevant to that in quite some time, unlike, say, the Unlimited team which made a fantastic thin block solution. 
Before you cry Segwit, I'll point out that not only is that a poor scaling solution as implemented, since it requires wallets to upgrade, but it's also not ready yet, and unnecessarily influences market forces by subsidizing some transactions over others.

Because if done as a hard fork, this would not be required. It's also a much less invasive change to the codebase that way.


Which several groups have since rejected, as they feel Blockstream tried to hoodwink them. The original document had Back signing as the president of Blockstream, but the document released had him as an individual. Many feel this is a betrayal of trust, and I wouldn't hold this agreement to much scrutiny. Especially given that it's easy to come to an agreement if you don't invite any of your critics.


Great in theory, worthless until they provide evidence that it's possible to keep it decentralized. As of yet, there has been no plan on how it would route transactions, and there's been no plan on countering centralization forces.


This much we can agree on, but as far as I'm aware Core hasn't been working much on that. Even if they were, I would much rather they work on expansion at a protocol level, or allow other people to do so. They seem adamant that the protocol level cannot be expanded, yet don't allow anyone else to try. This is what I'm against.


And that would be great if it helped in the short term. The point everyone is trying to make is that a level two solution doesn't matter if level one collapses before it can be implemented. And frankly, level two solutions should need to compete with the base layer. Core's vision seems to be that everyone needs to move to level two regardless of whether they want to or not.

Classic isn't piggybacking on the blockchain. It's an alternative node type.
If you'd said something like Colored Coins, you might have had a case, since that's actually using the blockchain for something other than a transaction.

Honestly, I agree that 20 is probably too much. But I also think that soft limits can mostly fix that, and that we ought to find a scaling algorithm of some sort if possible. There's too many risks to quickly state an opinion, and those risks aren't being investigated, only hypothesized.

Not necessarily. Faster block time would also increase potential transaction volume. And if you can balance it properly with the orphan rate it would slightly increase security. 
Now, there should definitely be more study on what that time *should* be, but I'm willing to bet 10 minutes is on the high side.

Which will drive traffic, and therefor value, away from Bitcoin




A valid transaction is a valid transaction. It is not a good goal to intentionally make it harder to transact, merely because you disagree with what is being transacted. This is part of why people like Bitcoin.


Fees will never be zero. This is silly. Even looking back at when we weren't near the size limit, this was never very common.


This is also not true, because not only is the relay network no longer maintained, but it also is not guaranteed as a stable connection. Even if it were, there would still be latency involved, just significantly less of it.
There's more problems that I see as well, but I need to get to work atm.

Up until recently it was a pretty valid assumption that everyone was running essentially the same software. But the point of a model isn't to be perfectly precise. It's a model after all. You need to make these sorts of assumptions to get anywhere with risk prediction. Otherwise you just calculate forever. So long as you can get the risk within a few percent it alright. 
As for your second point, every implementation I can think of would be very exploitatable. Perhaps someone smarter has an answer for you, though. 
@_date: 2016-03-18 17:38:40
My point is that the network is poorly managed, because blocks cannot contain peak capacity.
@_date: 2016-03-05 18:50:03
Great. By then, if current trends continue, Bitcoin will no longer be the go-to crypto. 
In all seriousness, though. If we had kept the block size pegged to the cost of the attack it was trying to prevent, it would be much higher than the protocol message limit right now. 
If it were proportional to the average size of a block then, the same holds true. 
As near as I can tell, there is no reason to keep the block size where it is except to influence how people use Bitcoin. I'm not interested in a planned economy. 
@_date: 2016-01-12 21:50:06

@_date: 2016-01-05 19:52:00
Sorry, is there a more concise phrase you'd like me to use for that? Double spend may not be exactly correct, but it captures the majority of the idea. Even then, we can model exactly the risk scenario of an unconfirmed transaction. With RBF implemented, we no longer have this capability. It increases the risk for a store to accept 0-conf from "less than credit cards and worth it" to "at least as much as credit cards and potentially not worth it".
How is it that going from predictable, relatively riskless\* methods to an unpredictable, significantly more risky set of methods is considered a step forward?
\*Except on large volumes of course

@_date: 2016-01-07 21:17:15
It seems you're misunderstanding how this works. Miners can set a soft limit on how large to make their blocks, just like today. The attack you're describing above can happen today as well, due to the differing soft limits. The difference is that miners can raise a soft limit in order to let in more transactions. This is not the case today, as it would require a hard fork to break past 1MB.
In addition to all of that, the soft limit style proposed by this would be flexible as well. So as the median block size increases (50% of miners think "wow, the network is getting overwhelmed"), it increases the block size of all the other actors as well until we hit equilibrium.
If miners are getting too large of an orphan rate, they can lower their soft limit in response to this.
In short, this style of attack works more effectively today than it would under that proposal, unless there's something I'm missing. The way to game it that most people are talking about is if 51% of the mining power formed a block size controlling cartel, and shifted the median wherever they liked. But at that point they could have significantly more power than just block size control, and likely wouldn't bother.

@_date: 2016-03-23 17:39:31
Okay, allow me to respond point by point, instead of blindly assuming I'll reject you.


This is definitely half true. On the one hand, nothing in Bitcoin's design is capable of preventing a 51% attack. On the other, it's definitely in Bitcoin's threat model, because it destroys it. I guess it depends on what you think he meant, but I'm willing to give you that one.


There's some greater context to this that you seem to have intentionally skipped on, but this isn't incorrect. There is a large chance that, if Bitcoin cannot scale in the next year-ish, it will be overtaken by a competitor, and suffer a slow painful death. The only way to scale is by addressing the block size limit, whether through segwit or an increase.


I don't know enough about miner incentives to comment for sure, but that particular example seems true. I'll mark that as a tie though, simply because I don't feel knowledgeable enough to comment for sure.


Again, you're missing the larger context here. In any case, I *strongly* disagree with anyone making that sort of call. I've always thought Gavin was incorrect to do so, even if I agree with Gavin that he's causing (as of late) more harm than good.


Not sure how this is a lie. I don't know if Proof of Stake works in the long term, but it seems to prevent a lot of the issues around miner trust, or at least make the relevant attacks much more expensive relative to the size of the network. Again, though, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and call this a tie.


This one is mostly true. There's very strong incentives to not have two active chains, and the only way you would get that is if a significant number of miners (25-15%) were either not paying any attention, or were actively irrational.


This was later retracted as more testing was done. I'll consider this a tie, given that it was incorrect, but since it was also retracted.


This is also the stance of Core. And there's no reason to not think this would be the case, unless you're willing to provide some.


Again, why do you think this is false? The miners determine what transactions get on the network, and the merchants/exchanges have the most sway in accepting one type node over another, so I'm not seeing what you're complaining about here.
Final tally:
4 truths or "close enough"s
2 mistruths or distasteful statements
3 others (unable to comment with certainty or retracted)

@_date: 2016-01-05 18:13:28
And that's fine if it ends up that way, but it's not the vision we were promised. We are not seeing any huge problems with transactions except that they're hitting an *arbitrary limit* that was designed to *prevent spam* and *be removed*. Remove this limit and a good chunk of transaction friction disappears. 
Fact is, we don't know where the scaling limit is right now. Could be 1.5MB. Could be 30MB. Nobody's testing it, and the few who are aren't getting the critical reviews we need to have an informed opinion on the matter. Either way we need to find out and take *that* into account, instead of something so arbitrary.
@_date: 2016-03-23 14:27:19

How about instead you justify your claims in the first place, or stop making them. 
Oh, and by the way, *duh* some of the support for Classic is fake. The same goes for Core, frankly. 
@_date: 2016-01-05 20:32:09
Let me explain it slightly differently then. In the current system, we can model risk in a 1-dimensional array of risk percentages, starting from the millisecond the first transaction is received by any node on the network. The only assumption the model makes is that every node involved is Core (and therefore neither relays nor mines a received double spend—XT would relay but not mine, and I don't know about BU, btcd, BitSharp, etc.). If it's modified to mine double spends anyhow, this model still holds fairly well, because it shows the probability of it getting to the miner in the first place. It would look sort of as follows (I'm making up numbers):
`{0:0.5, 2.5:0.495, 5:0.49, 7.5:0.48, 10:0.46}`
If you want to move to a RBF model, you need to add a second layer of arrays. So it would look something like this (where it's array[fee difference][time] = probability):
    {  0:{0:0.5,  2.5:0.495, 5:0.49, 7.5:0.48, 10:0.46},
     100:{0:0.52, 2.5:0.515, 5:0.51, 7.5:0.50, 10:0.48},
     200:{0:0.54, 2.5:0.535, 5:0.53, 7.5:0.52, 10:0.50}  }
In the first model, the fee doesn't matter because the vast majority of nodes will not relay a double spend. This would usually prevent it form getting to the miner unless the broadcast it very early. In the second, fee does matter, because RBF is condoned. The only reason the time matters is to see if it gets to the miner in time.

Where did I say that? Miners will likely do that sort of thing whether RBF exists or not. If they do, there are market consequences for those who knowingly allow double spends to be mined. The difference is that a lot fewer nodes will relay it to them without that.
Edit: also, I think you misused the word fallacy.
@_date: 2016-03-23 05:31:32
1. I'm not asking you to prove a negative. I'm asking you whether anyone but Satoshi could have made him the maintainer.
2. In what ways was it misdescribed? You're not being specific at all. 
3. "If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes..." So what was that about the whitepaper again? The point is that if the majority of miners are not being honest, bitcoin fails. When mining is as centralized as it currently is, collusion is not only possible, but likely. Therefor, bitcoin is not 100% trustworthy.

I'll try to explain, though I'm also fairly sure it wouldn't work.
Transaction 1: 
- | In | Out | Dest
1| 5| 2| recipiant
2| 3| 3| recipiant
3| -| 2| change
4| -| 1| fee
Transaction 2 (to replace 1):
- | In | Out | Dest
1| 5| 2| recipiant
2| **4**| 3| recipiant
3| -| 2| change
4| -| **2**| fee
In transactions 1 and 2, total designated outputs are the same. The implicitly assigned fee, and the inputs are the only things that differ. So the question is, could we make a version of FSS RBF where you can substitute an input instead of adding it.
And if so, could there be a designation on which outputs are "change" so that you can direct excess to/from there. That way you could potentially change the fee without even changing inputs. Just say "reduce by 15 satoshis from change", or some equivalent. Trade off there is slightly less privacy for increased likelihood of block inclusion. Under that scheme you could replace it with:
- | In | Out | Dest
1| 5| 2| recipiant
2| 3| 3| recipiant
3| -| **1**| change
4| -| **2**| fee

Every change is political. There is no effective difference between a hard and soft fork, except that a hard fork is simpler to code. I'd argue, in fact, that a hard fork gives people more freedom. Instead of being forced into a decision and relegated to SPV status, a user can vote *no* to a hard fork. That's not the case with a soft fork, or at least, to a significantly lesser extent.
Also, I'd point out that the parameter was *added* to consensus. So, in fact, consensus code has changed over time.

"Electronic Cash System". It can't be a cash system if it's being pushed in the direction of a settlement network.


It's more preventable by removing arbitrary limits. See further down.


There's a few fronts here. First of all, the claim is not that removing the cap would immediately institute a 2MB average. That's a little silly. It's more saying that the network can handle it on average.
Second, Rusty's data at the scaling bitcoin conference showed fairly conclusively that the network could handle as much as 8MB right now.
Third, using thin blocks and other solutions reduce the needed day-to-day bandwidth by almost half. Plus with the initial sync optimizations some others are working on, it's fairly clear that there's a lot of room for improvement in bandwidth usage.


A fee market fails on two different fronts.
First, it would only work in a vaccuum. In reality, it would compete with other, cheaper solutions, both crypto and fiat. This is not the problem I have with it, though, because the problem solves itself.
Second, it fails in the long term.
There are two approaches for securing the network in the long run. A fee market supposes that you can have relatively few, relatively expensive transactions. This fails (as near as I can tell) because one of Bitcoin's chief advantages has been the relatively cheap transmission of value. If it loses this advantage, not only does it have other cryptos which have not, but it also significantly reduces the pressure to switch from fiat.
The other approach relies on high volume. The logic goes that if you can compete on pricepoint alone (though that isn't to say that Bitcoin has no other advantages), you can make up for the lack of fees in volume. If we make the assumption that fees stay approximately the same per-transaction (average [here]( appears to be ~50BTC Edit: per day) you would need volume to go up by a factor of 72 to replace the current level of subsidy. With the fee market approach, fees would need to go up by that same factor, or more, since fewer transactions get made as it becomes more expensive.
Edit: Forgot to include this part:
That also isn't to say that a fee market won't pop up on its own. Rather than having it enforced by cartel, you can make a decent argument that it will arise natural from orphan pressures. Assuming that larger blocks have a higher orphan risk, this pushes miners to produce optimally small blocks (highest income per orphan risk). As people raise fees, or as optimizations are made, miners will respond by including more transactions.

You're forgetting that there's two attacks you can make with the block size limit. 
1. Spam until full. This has happened several times, is relatively easy to do, and is at its easiest right now. 
2. Mine a ridiculously large block to slow down the miners. This has never been done, but is what the block size limit is supposed to prevent.

If you think blocks aren't full, you just aren't paying attention. I don't know what else you want to call situations where there are &gt;10k pending transactions for multiple days in a row.

It seems to me that there's a way to make RBF where it can only increase the fee. The problem people have with RBF is that it makes 0-conf doublespending trivial (even compared to currently), so if we can force it to have the same total outputs to the same addresses, that ought to make everyone okay with it.
FSS RBF was the first thing I thought of when I thought of that. I didn't realize that it was so limited. Seems to me that we ought to simply expand on that. Allow you to add inputs/outputs to the transaction after the fact. The way it sounds, you're saying you can only add inputs, not outputs. Am I correct?

The problem is that both sides are equally valid in making that argument. There are bad actors on both sides of the divide, and it's best to remember that most have good intentions.

The only real debate for SegWit is whether to dot it as a hard or soft fork. The hard fork version is much cleaner, simpler code, but some see it as potentially unsafe, even though there's consensus that the change needs to be implemented.

First, I'm actually relaying the experts' opinion there. I fully recognize that I am not qualified to have an opinion on that particular matter.
Other than that, wallets will likely be affected by both (unless I'm misunderstanding how the change is made in the hard fork version) because of the new address format. 
@_date: 2016-03-23 03:57:33
No, that's not the case. For instance, the pro-large block side seems to be the only one that's done substantive research into how this would affect nodes on the network. Or if the other camp has, I've not seen it published.
Frankly, there are a lot of fronts that I disagree with Core on. Overall they have the right ideas, but the wrong order and implementations. 
From what I've seen (though I admit I'm not very familiar with the codebase yet), SegWit is *much* more complex than it needs to be, if they were willing to have it as a hard fork, rather than soft. It would both mean a much faster rate of adoption, as you wouldn't need to rework wallets, and it would remove the subsidies for witness data, which I disagree with on principal. A bit is a bit is a bit.
Edit: Also I'd like to mention the work that Unlimited has done. There's a good chunk of real scaling efforts they've put in, and I wish that more people would look at it.

Code = implementation. Otherwise I agree.

Consensus is done by the longest chain. This is how you determine what's an orphaned block. This is also the activation method for most soft forks. And for XT's planned hard fork.
If you can provide a method for measuring economic majority, then that's great. Let's use that instead. Until then, this is the best proxy we have. And even if it weren't a proxy, we still need it to be by miner vote anyhow, because they decide what transactions make it into blocks.
As for economic majority, 6 of the top exchanges (including the two largest Bitcoin companies) have signed off on XT.
Edit: I'll grant you the "signaled" part, but that's how you determine if it's mined by XT. Only one other implementation sets that bit, and that's BU.

Yes. Definitionally.

This is not a statement from all of Core. This is not even a statement from the top 6 members of Core, of which at least 2 disagree with this.
@_date: 2016-01-11 19:58:22
Actually, no it doesn't. The point of a soft fork is that it's transparent to anyone else who uses it. It's a new rule that looks valid, even though it isn't under their definition sets.
So you don't need majority miner support for it. You could slip it in any time. The only reason they're using miner support as an activation threshold is because it works as a proxy for consensus.
@_date: 2016-11-16 06:11:25
Imagine the following scenario. "Everyday users" make up 900kB/block on average. An "attacker" then decides to flood the blocks sufficiently to delay a quarter of transactions.
In a world with a 1MB blocksize limit, you need to generate 325kB of transactions, with fees greater than 25% of "normal" transactions. You actually need to generate less than 325kB/block, because empty blocks will sometimes happen from variance and headfirst mining, but that's not the point.
In a world with a 2MB blocksize limit, this attack is more expensive. You instead need to generate 1325kB/block, with the same fees. That's roughly 5x more expensive.
If you quadruple the blocksize limit instead, then you need to generate 3325kB/block, which would make it ~11x more expensive.
In all of these worlds, the attack grows more expensive over time, because people begin paying larger fees. So in any world this isn't very sustainable. But as you get closer to the arbitrary cap, it becomes more and more sustainable.
@_date: 2016-11-16 04:56:19
Again, I agree in the general case. It becomes an attack when you're in an artificially constrained environment, like we are today.
Double the blocksize, and this "attack" is no longer viable.
@_date: 2016-11-16 00:13:29


I'm aware. And I agree. But many here frame it this way, so if you want to be listened to you need to use the language of your environment.
The problem is that you need to face that in a constrained environment it's increasingly easy to delay other transactions. If I want to make sure every block is full right now it costs me X satoshis/day. Double the blocksize and that cost goes up by at least an order of magnitude.
@_date: 2016-11-15 21:49:20
I'm sorry, are you trying to say that Segwit *doesn't* allow for more than 1MB of transaction data in a block period? Because I think even will disagree on that front.

@_date: 2016-11-15 21:41:17


No, it's enabling a different spam attack.
There's two competing attack vectors if you're looking at block size.
1. You can flood blocks until normal users have delayed transactions
2. You can flood blocks in order to fill storage space
Having a blocksize limit reduces the risk of the second attack, but it *enables* the first to be much easier. And the closer that limit is to everyday usage the more cheaply one can use this attack.
Even if you disregard the other parts of the debate, this is a worthwhile thing to address.
@_date: 2016-11-15 21:51:03
Actually, it gives control to all nodes. If a block is really quite large, the majority of nodes don't relay it, so it's much more likely to get orphaned.
What Unlimited is trying to do is give control to some sort of market, rather than developers. After all, if you think markets are efficient (which most here do), then you think that node runners are more likely to know their limitations than the developers are. It's trying to *distribute* authority.
@_date: 2016-12-02 20:22:58
No, it only happens when it exceeds capacity of the network. It's not a reasonable assumption that we will always be over capacity.
In fact, we're only over capacity right now due to an artificial barrier. If a market were to come in place, let's say something similar to BU, then we could better determine actual capacity.
@_date: 2016-12-13 23:12:31
But it doesn't need to be free. It simply needs to be cheaper than the alternative.
Who exactly is making the argument that it needs to be free?
@_date: 2016-11-15 21:43:32
It was easier to do that in the past, actually. Mining is more distributed than at many times in the recent past.
Development, on the other hand... It would be very easy to compromise 2-3 developers and destroy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-02 22:18:07


Unless capacity grows faster. Which we have no reason to believe it can't.


Correct. There is no *static* blocksize which lets Bitcoin have sufficient capacity without overwhelming the network. However, if the network can *respond* to its increasing capacity, this statement probably is no longer true.


Lot's of problems with this line of argument.
First, while it doesn't hand it over to a real market, it does set up lots of incentives. For instance, an excessive blocksize will result in a much larger chance of your lock being orphaned. Partly from the fact that it takes longer to process and arrive at its destination, and partly because BU will make it take longer still when a user thinks it's too large.
Second, Bitcoin *is* controlled by the miners. Remember "one CPU one vote"? Miners don't make controversial decisions because they have strong economic incentives not to. NOT because they can't.
Lastly, it *doesn't* hand control to miners, because, as I outlined before, it gives users clear levers to pull if they think the network is getting too expensive. They can
* Stop running a node, which makes people worried
* Delay excessively sized blocks
* Not accept excessively sized blocks.


No. Core controls Bitcoin, at least in regards to this parameter.

Imagine a different scenario then. The average tps over several weeks is higher than the ability of nodes to process. Let's say the average transaction is 10kB. If the average rate of transactions becomes 6tps, then the backlog would increase by 4.2 MB per day.
Lots of bad things could happen with that. The mempool would double in a week. Quadruple in 3. Eventually nodes begin to crash because of the strain.

Nothing in particular. Each node has a gravity setting (-10 I think), and each link had a spring coefficient (0.019 I think). The gravity setting should eventually force the nodes apart while the spring brings newly connected transactions back into the fold. There's also some drag in there, which may explain why it took so long to self correct. 
Edit: I don't know if gravity is affected by node size or not. I haven't looked very far into VivaGraph.js's source, just their API

1. It does do this (currently at ~15 minutes, +/- a few seconds)
2. I'll look into it. Been a while since I worked with this sort of thing, so that might not be as easy as I'd think.
3. That one is harder than you'd think. One thing you can do is click on the transaction and drag it. This will pull the node. If you make sure to not mouse over anything else on the way to the corner, it should work. Another way would be to pause the animations by pressing the space bar. Actually, that's probably easier.
Edit: looks like my garbage collection patch broke pausing. Thanks for helping me catch that. I'm looking into it now.
Edit 2: pausing doesn't affect transaction info updates. That seems like something to fix, but at least pausing works now.
Edit 3: And thank you for the donation, by the way. I really appreciate it.
@_date: 2015-07-27 08:02:48
For three, would double clicking help? I think that's a defined behavior in VivaGraph.js.
@_date: 2015-07-24 23:01:43
I'm looking to put something similar on my full node. It would be pretty sweet. I'll post a picture of how this looks later so you get the idea.

That's why the deliberation process is so long. If it weren't, I *would* be against it. It feels intellectually dishonest to me to just dismiss this as a one sided risk. 
The other risk is that bitcoin simply becomes unusable for the average person, and I don't want that. 
Edit: as for the nodes situation, this has been that way for some time. Unfortunately I doubt there's much we can do about it, even if we did try to. The best we could hope for is that the number of SPV servers would be increased due to node pruning, but no SPV software works with that yet (to my knowledge) 
@_date: 2015-07-06 19:41:08
It likely would since there wouldn't be immediate blocks over the limit. But it still is a huge concern.

It sort of does this with the size of the node, but I definitely don't think that was the ideal solution. Opacity/color might be a good option, though. You're right.

@_date: 2015-07-29 19:49:35
Except the same effects you describe will happen eventually no matter what we do. Accelerating that isn't a good thing, for sure, but storage is *not* the concern. The concern is sync speed. At some point, catching up to the rest of the chain will become impossible for worse network connections. In most parts of the world that use bitcoin, this is not a problem. However, if you forget to take into account that the Great Firewall takes a big chunk of sync bandwidth, and that this is a great tool for smaller economies that may not have access to this, then you arrive at a wholly positive conclusion. *It's not*, but I still think it's better than the alternative.
@_date: 2015-07-28 21:28:26
I'm not sure. Before a couple weeks ago, I hadn't heard of either. Only reason I went with VivaGraph.js is because a lot of the work was already available for forking. From here on out it gets better.

But it becomes an issue if blocks are so flooded that transactions drop. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 14:13:32
They're only willing to fill the blockchain because it has impact on users. Remove that from the equation (by making their attack harder), and most of the incentive disappears. 
That's not to say it's riskless, but as someone who runs a full node, I'm willing to take that risk. 
Edit: also, I'd argue that there being "not enough nodes" is your opinion. 6000 is more than enough for trustworthy consensus, and the only reason that it's "gone down" so dramatically is because of a definition change. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 22:28:58

Sorry there, I thought I was replying to someone else. Didn't know this one was about CoinJoin, so I assumed you were talking about change addresses and the like. I'll look into the structure, but I'm not sure how I'm going to parse through the structures without murdering performance.
In the meantime, I think it'd be kinda cool to start classifying these transactions taxonomically. The giant red clusters could be something like *negotium orbis rufus* (transaction ball red).

How are rewards doled out? 
@_date: 2015-07-10 07:24:21
Perhaps there are several forces roughly balancing. 
1. Greek stuff, for the obvious reasons
2. Congestion leads to less liquidity, making people worry and sell
3. Congestion also shows durability of the network, and that it's more resilient than most thought, making people confident and buy
Probably screwing up somewhere in there, but that's how I'm seeing it. 
@_date: 2015-07-25 18:50:17
I don't actually know if it would recognize coinjoin transactions for what they are. One of the things that the original developer wanted to do was categorize transactions, and whole I don't know how, I definitely want to try.

Okay, if they can't kill the network, they can completely fill the blocks to the point where no other transactions get through.
How is the network not dead at that point?

Perhaps I can provide some justification. 
Most CS people are broadly aware they don't know everything, however, because their job is slowly expanding to interact *with* everything, it requires a cursory understanding of more and more. Often this understanding only needs to be enough to get the job done, and then one forgets about it. 
For me, I have lots of limits. For instance, I'm fairly good at parsing data, but not so much at obtaining it. I'm good at learning, but not nearly as much at retaining. And perhaps my most fatal limitation, I often assume people will react how I do. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 14:30:35
Approximately the same thing it says about Microsoft and Sony.

No. A well funded attack could easily destroy the network. There aren't enough players in the game to resist a bank/government/multi-billionaire. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 14:09:34
Except it's prevented (partly) by the same mechanism as the other attack. Much like how, until recently, you didn't see this sort of attack, once the limit is raised, spam attacks would likely disappear for some time. The attacker would feel there was no immediate impact. 
So yes, it does open another avenue, but is a much safer one, IMO, and less detrimental to UX.

This is a set of transactions as viewed on [my visualizer website]( Each of the blue nodes are a transaction broadcast, the reds are outputs, the greens are inputs, and the yellows are both.

11 is his favorite number. There's lots of elevens.
Coincidentally, it was also a major joke among my high school's marching band and robotics team. For the marching band, they would do it during warm-ups.

Normally it would take 10 seconds, but *every once in a while* it would take 11.

@_date: 2015-07-25 18:47:25
Because you never connect it back to the original transaction. It's impossible, especially since all things in the blockchain need to happen in order. I suppose someone could broadcast such a transaction, but it would never confirm.

UPDATE: I finally fixed the garbage collection. All nodes will last fifteen minutes after modification. Garbage collection is done every time the web socket gets a message, so nodes might drift freely for a moment before they disappear.
Is fifteen minutes a good time? I want to make it user-settable eventually, but for now I'd like to tune it to what y'all want.
@_date: 2015-07-25 09:19:44
It's a graph of unconfirmed transactions. Red is output, green is input, yellow is spent outputs. (might have those mixed around, I forget). The blue nodes represent one transaction, and the lines show connections between them.

The point is it takes a lot more money to sustain the attack. You have to pay transaction fees on each one, if you're going to be effective. Most attackers get quickly priced out at that range.

@_date: 2016-02-15 15:03:49
And they wouldn't do this because most nodes wouldn't build on it. Thin would mean it's not the longest chain, so they lose money. 
If it did work, the price would likely crash, leading to more incentive to stay with current consensus. But that's all it is, is consensus. This can, and has, change. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 05:46:49

Even if they get your DNA info, it's illegal to use that information in calculating your insurance rates. You can thank Bush for that. 
It's also illegal to deny based on preexisting conditions, thank to Obama. 
So while I think that on the whole the FDA is good, it seems silly to defend them here.

The second one is very common from what I've seen. The more fun ones are when certain places pay out they do so in a long chain. So you'll occasionally see a system where it ropes in all the other transactions in a little corral.

It actually uses the Blockchain.info websocket API (unfortunately). This has the unfortunate effect of duplicate transactions sometimes showing up, but the input/output nodes usually self-correct.
Currently it can detect block arrivals, but does nothing on them. 
@_date: 2015-09-27 06:19:42
It does in the same way as hobbyist miners. AFAIK, they are not considered money transmitters, nor are the pools.

I actually tried to do this, and possibly will try again, but I worry I may have burned that bridge from my lack of responsiveness. I've been totally overwhelmed :(

I actually forked it. Never managed to contact the original author, but I improved some efficiency things and a bit of aesthetics.

Odd. I knew Intel skimped out on my work laptop, but I didn't realize it was quite so stark.
Either way, it looks like garbage collection is running on a relatively short time given your screenshot.

I still don't disagree, but for the record, the FDA didn't ban them from collecting genetic information. They only banned them from using it to tell about potential diseases. 
@_date: 2015-04-13 21:42:33
This would be perfect for me. 
Edit: especially if the points are automatically converted to bitcoin, even if they aren't set immediately. Or at least if there was an option for that. 
@_date: 2015-09-10 17:38:49
This would be really interesting to see. If you'd like, we could work together on some ways to identify each kind. Probably changing the color of the transaction node. 
I've been toying with making a client-side version of this at some point anyhow, so it's not like it'd be a huge deal.
@_date: 2015-09-10 17:32:55
Unfortunately the garbage collection isn't all that great yet. Even on my gaming build it still begins to lag heavily after ~40 minutes. On my work laptop it's more like after 2. If I could find a way to do framerate detection without blowing up the whole structure it would be much easier.
@_date: 2015-04-22 01:52:55
@_date: 2015-04-15 15:03:24
Subscribed. Looking into it ASAP.
@_date: 2015-04-15 15:02:34
Sounds like an interesting project. I'll look into it a bit, but if you could give me a place to start looking (ie, where the functions to write/read blockchains from the disk are) that'd be awesome.
It'd also be better if I had a higher-level reference to look at as well. I usually prefer C++, but sometimes it gets a little obfuscated.
@_date: 2015-09-10 18:37:11
It's a problem with the node module I'm using. It's definitely efficient, but it still slows everything down dramatically once things get going. If I open up Chrome's task manager when there's heavy load (on my work laptop), it ends up being a full thread dedicated to calculations (sometimes heavy, sometimes moderate), and a full thread dedicated to OpenGL processing (almost always at max). So garbage collection definitely treats the symptoms, but I can't fix the disease on my end.
Edit: Yeah, I definitely could improve upon the interface. I'll look into that in the next while. Work has been really eating up a lot of my time lately, so I had to drop this for a while.

The idea is for it to passively contribute your idle resources. Think a general network a la Folding At Home. 
@_date: 2015-11-13 07:32:09
Not at all. It's supposed to be a general distribution platform for Folding at Home style projects, where distributed computing is easily viable. It also will offer a payment system if distributors would want to incentivize people to perform *their* research over someone else's.
Of course, there's also a charity mode.
@_date: 2015-11-13 07:38:10
How could I phrase that better? "Distributed problems proposed by researchers" seems cumbersome.
@_date: 2015-11-16 02:09:22
In that case it's critical to what I'm working on. Good.

The natural rate is at the moment capped to 1MB per ~10 minutes. If this barrier were not in place,the equilibrium would be determined by how high a fee users are willing to pay. It would be a market scenario, because it costs (a little) more resources to send each additional transaction. 
@_date: 2015-11-13 06:34:40
Now, for the silly part:
Yes, it is an open source project, but no, I will not accept any submissions quite yet. I need to do the bulk of the work myself, or the department will disqualify the project.
I would, however, appreciate it if someone could point out where I'm going wrong in compiling miniupnpc. I can't seem to get it to work in Windows to save my life.

What's worse is that they disabled NFC capabilities in all their registers prior to this, so even if you don't use Apple Pay, you suffer. (and they wasted money)

My problem is how difficult it is to get. To preface this, I'm no longer a minor, so it's easy, but the only time I had ever been able to *buy* bitcoin before was through a BTM. There aren't many of those. 
If there were easier ways to get some, I think bitcoin could more easily take off.

Computer science in general. They don't require the research to be limited to a specific area, so long as it's substantial and you can show significant progress. There also has to be a Batman reference in the presentation or you fail. 
We don't know if they're joking an that last part, but nobody has tested them on it for at least a decade.

Of course it will be, but it's still a larger barrier. I don't think there is a way to anonymously/pseudononymously participate in a raffle without it being gamable.
If you required a pay-in then things would be different, but it would also cause a lot of legal issues, since it would be international by default.

Wow. You have to read really hard to reach those conclusions *and* not have proper grammar doing so. Those last sentences are barely intelligible. 
Look. Nobody (in this thread, I can't speak for the rest) is saying that women are worth less or can't compete. You clearly don't mean that, and the person you *actually agree with* doesn't either. 
Yknow the only place you disagree? The solution. 
See, the basic argument here is about affirmative action. Do we displace [trait]-ism by using [opposite of trait]-ism? I fall firmly on the "education is our friend, not further segregation" camp. 
Just because of that, however, does not mean I can't see both sides. There is certainly logic to the affirmative action stance, I just don't think it will work in the long run. To me it's a difference between long term strategy and mid/near term strategy.

You could include a small paper wallet in their packages. Even if it's just a dollar per customer (over x dollars purchased) that still would amount to a good deal of interest. Be sure to include that they can pay for products on your site with it. 
In fact, if you enable bitcoin partial payments, you could almost treat it like a gift card.
