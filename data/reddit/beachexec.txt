 FUCKING DAMN IT I WAS ON THE SHITTER AND LOST 300!!!!

They announced it this morning. They said yes and you should totally blow your life savings on it! &lt;3
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:41:59
Will the price plunge if rejected?
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:19:20
I do not want this to happen. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:54:19
"Smack me please, momma. Please..."
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:59:58
It'd make it easier for people to get somehow. I'm not sure how it's that hard now, but I'm bracing myself for disappointment.
@_date: 2017-03-10 15:35:39
Do you know what sub you're on?
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:11:54

Yes, sneering at meme grammar is the way to feel smart.
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:43:19
That's for the filing, not the ruling, according to the people here.
@_date: 2017-03-10 15:50:16
I'm just enjoying how we spell hodling
@_date: 2017-03-10 15:45:00
Ah yes, let's all completely give up on things that are new because bad things might happen.
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:20:35
I love how these assholes won't raise taxes on Wall St. speculation but still go after Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:20:59
Hell yeah I casually was on my phone and it pretty much flew out of my butthole.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:12:41
 TURDCOINS!!! THOSE ARE VALUABLE AS FUCK!!
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:05:19
As opposed to assuming it's all bad?

Okay, fine. But I get at least two helper monkeys who wear tuxedos. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 01:41:54
They'll just dump a fuckton of fees on you.
The banks know their time is up and they're getting fucking *desperate.*
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:57:08
I hear you. I guess as a long time guy I don't fall into that trap. Best answer so far, BTW.
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:23:51
True, but the drugs were fun, too.

Segwit locksin tomorrow. The correction will likely be *very* brief if at all.
@_date: 2017-08-11 15:26:27
I always thought they were just jealous.
@_date: 2017-08-12 09:25:45
Segwit and a possible worldwide economic collapse are driving this now. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:39:44
Exactly. I don't mean to be a dick, but it kinda blows me away that people wander in here asking if it's a good time to buy. The answer is always YES!!! Like, enthusiastic porn actress YES!!
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:32:34
Everyone Please Be Careful
 crash your sick-ass LAMBORGHINI!!!!!

Only 10% as happy.
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:31:04
Is this for real though? I keep hearing it's gonna activate, then it's gonna activate, then lock in, the activate, then lock in, then *finally* activate. 
And before you tell me I'm stupid, I'm aware, thank you. I'm just trying to hold onto the safety bars on this roller coaster.

Hey! Don't ruin his fun!

My parents had to sell their 1967 Jet Black Plymouth Barracuda to have me. When I asked my mom why she didn't abort me she smacked me harder than I had ever been hit than in all the years I used to box. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:38:35
I am buying, fuck that!! :D
@_date: 2017-05-12 05:11:53
There's a lot of people who can and *have* explained it better than me in other places than Reddit.
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:14:51
I would normally agree but every time the price dips like 100 eager buyers crazily jump in for "their chance."
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:41:17
Huh... that kind of explains a lot. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:52:39
That shit is a kick in the nuts to the dollar!
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:45:52
Headed to the moon, of course.

I would be tickled pink if the entire front page was filled with this cute little motherfucker. Tickled pink, I tell you.
On a more serious note, when we all finally agree we are on the moon, I'll buy a top hat, monocle, and tap dance like Mr. Peanut. Hold me to it, guys.

Looks like he's serious.

Heh, all good.
@_date: 2017-05-11 05:32:37
They're pretty upset. 
Also, TPTB don't like having their stranglehold on the money supply challenged.
@_date: 2017-05-12 16:00:10
True... but I still love that old Vegas charm.

It means that it's a significant currency greater than that of most average sized state economies, and thanks to scarcity, it'll only get better.

Now I wanna see comments calling us delusional conspiracy theroists.

By the way, I wasn't I agreed or not, just that many think this.

Bubbles don't burst! Stop saying stuff!!
@_date: 2017-05-11 16:45:06
Exhaustive list of things I regret about my experience with Bitcoin:
1) Not Buying Sooner
2) Not hodling
3) Ever thinking it was a joke. I want to go back to 2009, grab that smug, arrogant jackass that I was by the lapel and tell him to buy and hodl and shut his dumb ass up.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:27:20
Can't wait for everyone to declare Bitcoin dead for the billionth time right before the rally.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:28:15
The normies will pounce on their last chance!
@_date: 2017-05-12 06:27:49
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:50:52
I personally think it's Asian Market access and fear of worldwide economic collapse. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 20:11:00
News like this make cryptocurrency investors look like geniuses.
@_date: 2017-05-11 18:20:26
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:39:15
Long story short, the banks that were involved with Ripple committed to locking up a massive majority of the coins in escrow to make sure that there were plenty for them by the end of the year. But then at consensus they had announced banks won't be using XRP after all. There's some fucky shit going so I returned back to good ol' Bitcoin and couldn't be happier.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:55:38
Nah man, Bitcoin is dead forever and there definitely won't be a MASSIVE rally like all the other times. Gawd you guys are delusional conspiracy theorists. /s
@_date: 2017-05-11 20:23:59
I demand words!!! **AND THE MOON!!**

What do the numbers in that graph measure?
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:44:12
I started out with Bitcoin, rode the first ETH bubble, then went to Ripple, rode that massive bubble and sold at 35 cents, and now I'm back here laughing my ass off at this post. Feels fucking great, man.
@_date: 2017-05-12 01:38:34
There have been dozens of posts why current cryptocurrencies are better choices.
@_date: 2017-05-11 16:46:55
Holy shit, when was this made?!
Edit: That was literally the best thing I've ever seen.

Here, [this is for you, since you're so butthurt.](
@_date: 2017-05-11 16:53:32
New or not, it's a good point and it may not be a bad idea for those who are accustomed to using Bitcoin to start using it as a courtesy to new buyers not only as that, but also to make sure they don't get scared off from buying what they may perceive to be a tiny amount of something they see as something really valuable.
The fact remains that this is still going to go up and people are still just now coming around to the idea of Bitcoin. Not only does it not hurt to write it out to help people understand, it really does a service. 
Accusing him of just wanting karma is kinda asinine considering that this is a text post and as far as I know, those don't add to your karma anyway.
@_date: 2017-05-11 20:09:37
My ass. I keep everything in there so I can pull them from there for comical effect.

*sigh* wrong again. Anal from Rabbits. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:37:45
No, the price just massively dropped so it's totally completely dead just like every other time and there won't ever be another freakishly bigger rally either.
What are you gonna do? Learn from history or listen to Mr. Regret and his logic?
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:46:36
Wow, finally a version of this thing I kinda like! :)
