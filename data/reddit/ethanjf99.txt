I'm not sure that's correct to be quite honest. Art has a recognized market. Governments understand and accept that people are willing to pay money for art and that it has value if stolen.
But a currency that a given government doesn't recognize? not sure. 
On the other hand: if Mt Gox itself stole the BTC (which I think is perhaps likely) then depending on the nature of their legal agreement with their users, their may be a case for fraud.
i.e., if in their agreement they promised to safeguard your deposits at the same time as they were taking them.

and I can't remember where I read that the Japanese were not looking at this as a crime (yet) because Japan doesn't recognize BTC as a currency.

this [article]( suggests that a lawsuit is the only recourse for investors. Makes no mention of criminal charges, etc.

not sure it *is* theft. if gov'ts don't recognize bitcoin as a currency, then to their mind he was stealing something of no value. can't prosecute for that. In the eyes of the law, this would be little different than his stealing a bunch of Monopoly money.

stealing means taking something of value from someone else. If the government doesn't think you took anything of value from them, then you're out of luck.

In a jurisdiction that recognized BTC as a digital commodity, stealing it would be theft, I assume. But if a given jurisdiction does NOT recognize it as such, then it's nothing.

If they hacked into the computers, then I agree -- I assume that would be a felony (although I find it more plausible that Mt Gox itself stole the money)

not if the asset doesn't have value (as defined by the government). If I have a piece of scrap paper with "ONE MILLION DOLLARS" written on it, and you steal it, you can't be charged with felony theft: you stole a valueless object.
In the government's eyes, this is the same. BTC is not a currency. It's just a collection of data without any intrinsic value (again, in the government's eyes). Doesn't matter that other people were willing to pay good money for that valueless object.
If you're going to spend money on something government doesn't consider a valid currency then don't expect government protection in the form of law enforcement action when it's taken.

glad to hear you got out (relatively) ok. yes there may be statutes that apply and hopefully so. 
however, "tangible" is precisely what BTC is NOT. In any way, shape, or form.
