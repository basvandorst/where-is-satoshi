Honestly, they've pretty much become Fox talk radio hosts.  You hear talk about how the government is going to ruin everything, and bitcoin will save us all.  Then there's a terrible situation somewhere and the ~~gold bugs~~ bitcoin advocates come our saying how holding your funds in bitcoin would have saved everything.

For a quick translation of the key details, the Venezuelan banking authorities have instructed banks not to allow citizens to withdraw more than 10,000 bolivar  ($5) in cash per day.  It was supposed to go into effect December 1, but banks began enforcing it November 15th, including limiting withdrawals by ATM or traveler's checks.  While some people are advocating adopting Bitcoin, others are scared that the price is rising on it locally and may wind up in a situation similar to India, where bitcoin is trading at a $100 premium compared to markets like the US.  Indeed, according to the data from one of the region's most popular exchanges, bitcoin is already trading around the Indian premium at roughly $875 per bitcoin.
To add some perspective, and this is my addition, at $875 per coin, 1btc costs approximately 6.34 month's minimum wage at the most favorable current exchange rate

I could easily see this catching on in other African countries like Zimbabwe, where the government loves to interfere with the economy, to disastrous effect for the average citizen.  I would imagine they'd love to have a (comparatively) reliable currency, and bitcoin could provide a safer alternative for them to do business and save money in.  It would be pretty damn cool to see it take off there.

So, in other words bitcoin is dangerous because they haven't found a way to manipulate it and control it to their advantage yet?  Sounds about right.  You have to wonder how they can use this as an argument against bitcoin when a) there is ample evidence that these people are not trustworthy with regards to financial decisions that impact others, and b) there is a mountain of documentation on bitcoin that explains that being uncontrolable is precisely the point.
