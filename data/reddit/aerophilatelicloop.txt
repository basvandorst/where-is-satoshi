@_date: 2018-01-11 20:36:18
Feel free to send me an update for the text if you find it funny or misleading, we currently don't have so users can set their own fee / byte, but we might add it.
Good or bad propaganda?
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:32:00
I made a post earlier today, that Twitter account needs to be taken down 
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:53:37
Have a look at bitfees.info to see the fees
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:01:06
We have seen that all wallets doesn't show the transaction fee and we have seen people on this forum talking about buying stuff and having to pay extreme fee's that they didn't know about. 
This site is not for everyone, but we hope to help some who has no idea on how any of this works or have a wallet that don't show them the transaction fee. I hope that answers your question, otherwise just ask another one :P

It certainly is, comparing fees between regular bitcoin and segwit is 75% off ~ Bitfees.info

@_date: 2018-01-14 13:14:09
Have a look at bitfees.info, there you can see the fastest and cheapest transaction fee. 
If you would have a used a site like this you would not have to wait .P 
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:33:22
Scroll down and open the "bytes" calculator. 
There you can calculate the in and outs.
Well, there's an recommendation of how many sat/byte you should use, you could play around with it and by that giving you a lower fee.
Make sure you are around the recommendation. If you use less you will have to wait more but the fee is smaller.
Also, there's an update coming out soon that will give you the ability to see how long it will take with your own sat/byte fee. Not sure when it will come out though
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:15:44
Have a look at bitfees.info for fee information and also calculating your fee
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:21:16
I'm interested.
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:01:53
Thanks bill! We are working on more implementations and the current sat/byte will be on display soon.

Edit : It will take you ~168 hours. I suggest you checking out the website i listed above.
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:30:36
I would say the largest fee. 
The more you pay, the faster your transaction confirms. "It's almost like a bidding system. 
You have to outbid other users to get your transaction done first" or something in that way 
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:51:57
Have also at Bitfees.info for a better fee "which will complete"
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:41:51
Its all about inputs and outputs really. It doesn't matter if you send 1 btc from lets say, 1 input and 2 outputs. 
Or if you send 0.00005 bitcoins with 1 input and 2 outputs.
Have a look at bitfees.info :p
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:38:47

@_date: 2018-02-04 19:58:01
I have chosen to include my age in the title only as a joke. 
I saw another redditor having her age in the title when promoting her app. 
My age is not relevant in any way here, im only using it as a "meme  :&gt;
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:35:53
Keep in mind that you can use the site as a price ticker. 
You can easily see the price in the TAB
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:18:37
