Technically, if this nation was recognized by the US, it would change Bitcoin's treatment under the MSB laws. Most exchanges would likely be dealers in foreign exchange, not money transmitters.

I'll be there. See you all soon.
@_date: 2015-06-13 01:22:30
Let me know if I can help! :)

Hi there. I'm Marco Santori.  I'm NY-based*, but I represent clients in CA and all around the world.  Feel free to reach out to me with any questions.
Born and raised in Los Angeles, though.  Not sure if that counts ;)

I can only hope that the other states follow suit on the sales tax issue.

This letter was glorious.
@_date: 2014-10-14 15:32:19
Jim, where did you get that ridiculous title?
@_date: 2014-12-16 17:39:35
CSBS is an organization of the state regulators that currently issue licenses to the Bitcoin businesses that require them.  Also, on the federal level, they often speak for those regulators.
This is an important opportunity for regulated businesses to have a voice in the way the state regulations play out across the country.

Thank god for Patrick Murck. Otherwise, it would always just be bad cop-bad cop with the government.

I'm actually quoted in this article, and even I have no idea who these "sources" are that think Nasdaq is going to be a currency exchange.  It sounds pretty ridiculous to me.  There's no reason to think that Nasdaq's license would cover bitcoin exchanging. In fact every word from SEC indicates to the contrary.

well thank you very much!

@_date: 2014-04-17 23:28:46
well done, Juan.
@_date: 2014-07-16 21:14:14
Wow. I'm nontrivially amazed by this.  Great news.
@_date: 2014-01-05 08:24:12
I am teaching that class :)

Go Bears!
Also: how exactly are you saving $3k per semester?  Can you break that down?
@_date: 2014-11-27 03:54:23
Very, very excited for Hellobit.  
Also, your thumbnail looks like Rick James using a laptop.
@_date: 2014-12-16 22:51:56
Correct. Banks are not part of CSBS.  It's the agencies *regulating* them that are.
@_date: 2014-04-22 01:27:50
Will respond in the a.m.  Looking forward to it as well.
@_date: 2014-04-08 18:41:56
I wouldn't say that we're an "authority", really.
@_date: 2015-05-01 03:05:41
I'm honored you would suggest it!
@_date: 2016-03-24 03:21:27
The lawyers, obviously.
@_date: 2014-06-20 19:38:01
Love it.  Checking out the site now.

Just a heads-up: Pillsbury and I will be making ourselves available for short break-out sessions giving free legal advice for developers.
@_date: 2015-08-07 20:31:37
Agree with  AB1326 isn't perfect, but it's pretty darn good (and some have worked very hard on getting it there).
@_date: 2015-08-25 01:27:48
If I recall the interview, I think i downplayed the 51% attack risk.  Keep in mind I'm a lawyer talking to lawyers, not a developer talking to developers. Only so much specificity is appropriate there. That, and I could have just been wrong about some stuff.  Happy to learn if you're willing to teach.

In Circle's defense, money transmitters are required by law to send such receipts for each transaction, usually regardless of volume.

wow that guy doesn't even look like me ;-)

Our excellent tax team wrote it :)

I think it's tempting to say "Any time our crypto contacts fiat, there will be AML concerns."  To be sure, whenever banks are involved, customers will be faced with the specter of government reporting.  
It's tempting, but it isn't broad enough.  Customers will face government reporting even when exchanges don't involve fiat.  Under FinCEN, indeed international (FATF), guidelines, exchanges are required to report transactions regardless of whether they are crypto-to-crypto (e.g. BTC to LTC) or crypto-to-fiat (e.g. BTC to USD).  
In fact, customers will face this so long as they are "customers", that is, so long as they are being serviced by a business.  Thus, many believe that the "distributed exchange" model is the holy grail to avoid the reporting structure.  No single exchange acting as a "business", and therefore no "customers".  
These people would likely be surprised to hear that this would simply move the obligations down the chain, placing even greater responsibilities on banks to monitor account activity for high transaction volume, velocity and frequency.  Thus, any participant in the distributed exchange doing sufficient exchanging would be detected by the bank.  As a result the participant would either need to comply with the same regulations as, say, BTC-E, or be shut down.
Back to square one.

Excellent write up.
