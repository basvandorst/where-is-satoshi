No it's not, the handful of developers do not decide which exchange is good (secure) exchange and which is not. There is no logic in the code to say:
    if exchange_name == "a"
      allow to use BTC
    else 
       exit

Agree 100%, People should use BTC to stick a finger to the fat cats and not try to become one.
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:54:08
Yeah. What I do it, send fiat to my Circle account and then send the same amount of fiat to BTC address. Circle converts that fiat to BTC (take a little cut themselves) and sends it to the given address.

I don't think this is the problem of Bitcoin. As soon as you start talking about "bitcoin security foundation", that is a central authority, opposite what Bitcoin/Blockchain is all about.
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:02:05
Yes send fiat over circle to you. Then you in the Circle app, paste your BTC wallet's address and select how much fiat to send. In 30-60mins, you should have BTC in your wallet. Never keep BTC in wallet that you do not control. Get an BTC wallet on your phone or a Trezor or something similar.
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:59:56
Wouldn't there be a problem with the fact that anyone can generate an address anyway.
I sympathize with your loss, but nothing will stop crypto being stolen if its not protected properly in the first place.

Hats off to the guy for not crumbling under pressure and thinking straight. But this article could really do with understanding Bitcoin first too:
"Is Bitcoin particularly vulnerable to counterfeiting?
The Bitcoin network works by harnessing individuals' greed for the collective good. 
A network of tech-savvy users called miners keep the system honest by pouring their computing power into a blockchain, a global running tally of every bitcoin transaction. 
The blockchain prevents rogues from spending the same bitcoin twice, and the miners are rewarded for their efforts by being gifted with the occasional Bitcoin. 
As long as miners keep the blockchain secure, counterfeiting shouldn't be an issue."

Shows current price and total value of each. Also having the Daily/Weekly/Monthly Balance is interesting. I primarily got it for Tax reasons. Please be aware that on the Free version it only processes up to 300 transactions and does not allow any API processing. You have to get to the Pro tier to get API processing (up to 3000 transactions total)

We wanted to provide customers notice of how a possible hard fork of the Bitcoin protocol into Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Unlimited will affect Coinbase accounts.
The only version of Bitcoin supported on the Coinbase platform today is Bitcoin Core, currently represented by the symbol BTC.
We may provide support for Bitcoin Unlimited in the future depending on market conditions and stability of the protocol, but we cannot guarantee whether or when such support may be available. Customers who wish to access both blockchains at the time of the hard fork should withdraw their BTC from Coinbase since we cannot guarantee what will happen during the hard fork or when this access may be available.
If one chain receives an overwhelming majority of support from miners, users, and exchanges, we reserve the right to alter the names of chains or discontinue support for certain chains in the future.
Ensuring the safety of customer funds is our top priority. In the event of a hard fork of the Bitcoin protocol, it is likely that Coinbase will temporarily suspend the deposit and withdrawal of bitcoin from the platform pending our assessment of the technical risks posed by any fork, such as the possibility of replay attacks, network instability, or other factors. Customers should take note that they will not be able to withdraw bitcoin from or deposit bitcoin to Coinbase for a period of up to 24 hours or more following the fork. In the event of a hard fork of the Bitcoin protocol, Coinbase may suspend the ability to buy or sell on our platform during this time.
Coinbase looks forward to working with other exchanges and development teams to ensure the smooth execution of future hard forks with as little disruption as possible. Customers should continue to monitor our support pages and Twitter account for updates regarding our support for digital currencies on the platform

The guestimated values is based on couple of things:
- The total amount of Bitcoins mined and can only be 21million. So this means its finite.
- The more people adopt it, the higher the value the coins are perceived to be.
- It cannot be controlled by a single entity, this gives value.
- It cannot be hacked(don't confuse this with stolen), as its de-centralised.
What this value may be, no one knows. If someone is telling you they know what it will be, don't waste time on them - they don't know, at best it's a guestimate.

Can you explain that? Blockchain is a ledger, society has been using them for thousands of years. 
One can program Blockchain in under 30 minutes - 
If one can grasp the concepts of a Blockchain does that mean they understand Cryptocurrencies and how Bitcoin, or Etherium or Litecoin work? No.
Understanding how Cryptocurrencies and in this case Bitcoin, is more of a skill than understanding what a Blockchain is.

Can your friend track every Dollar bill she has in her wallet? Can she provide information about every transaction that bill was used for/part of? How can she prove it is not fake? How can she prove that bill was not used for illegal activities? It is much easier to use bills for illegal activities than Bitcoin.
before you try to convince someone about benefits of Bitcoin, try to show them the failures of the current system and provide Blockchain + Crypto currency as an alternative.

I had a few people telling me that it is too late now to get into BTC. 
This is my response: Is Gold too late to get in? Who buys Gold as an investment? Gold has been dropping in value for the last 5 years. If one thinks that while Gold's long term drop with short term spikes is still a better investment over BTC that has been rising long therm with short term dips, then I just stop the conversation as I am not prepared to waste my breath on them. I find it amazing when even when I show charts side by side, people who have been investing for years and my description of the essence of crypto currency still don't get it.
I feel that if a rational person looked at the two charts side by side, there is no way that Gold is a better investment. 
No it is not too late to get into BTC. It is just the beginning.
Note: I only pick Gold as example as that's what the non crypto first try to compare it to.
