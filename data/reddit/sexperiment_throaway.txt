People who do market-making. Buying above the market price and selling belowing, making the spread, provide liquidity to the exchanges. Liquidity to the exchanges is good because there is more stable price discovery, more stable bitcoin price, which means that people will actually start asking for real bitcoin prices at some point.

transactions all date back from 2011, man that would have been some pretty nice ROI
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:53:19
No, but I don't think bitcoins will go away and disappear, more and more people will want it to succeed, which increased demand, which increases the price. Regardless of one's beliefs it's fun to make estimates. 
Btw: I think I read your $389,141 wrong. the convention in my country is that the ',' is used as '.' in the english language convention. So I read it as in six months the price will go down to $389.141, which I found ridiculously low. I don't think we will see $400 again, if we do it will probably be for less than 3 minutes.

What stops people from using other virtual currencies? Acceptance. If everybody has bitcoins, wants bitcoins, what am I going to do with my obscure altcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:36:53
are you Satoshi?
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:55:57
perhaps because they realize they can sell some coins before others find out and do the same, so they downvote it, sell some coins, upvote it, wait till the price is low and buy back? It's a nasty world we live in...

Want to bet that the price of bitcoin is higher than it currently is on 4th of March 2014? Price: Reddit Gold

But on the other hand if you merely hoard your coins and not spend them on goods and services, and everybody thinks like you, it's never going to kick off..

The price went up because of China and media coverage which drove it even higher. Now the price is dropping because of china. It think if you would buy somewhere between today and the end of next week, you'd get a fair price... 
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:34:43
Well if you read about the news of China right when it came out you're very likely to be ahead of the people who panic sell.. You might buy back not long after and miss out on buying even lower, but you still end up with more coins than you had before. of course there is always a risk you are wrong and you need to buy back lower. But sometimes it's worth the risk...

Still, I also bought at around 1000 dollars, but I also bought half a year ago, so I still have a pretty nice ROI. So people crying either suffer from amnesia or have only bought in the last two months... It's april all over again, except the "crash" is far less dramatic but there are more crybabies. It's simple, buy and hold for a year at least and you will have a nice ROI, regardless of all the bumps...

Bitcoins become cheaper. Something everyone has been waiting for right? 
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:51:34
Well I don't know but if you are a long term investor that thinks in years rather than little months, these are just fluctuation on the way up.... I'm not even surprised... it was going up like crazy... 
Also look at the volume on the exchanges, if you hold 1000+ coins these prices don't mean much.

In this subreddit: People lumping 80% of the other people in a very simplistic catagory and complaining about it. I wish the sky was green, but is blue :(
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:38:25
Of course, there will be dutch stoners, and for sure you will find them exactly there :) 
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:25:26
Bitcoins are a lot cheaper than they were yesterday, very likely because of this news, and this guy is being downvoted for stating that fact and his appetite for bitcoins? 
Unless you think he wants to buy bitcoins to pay for a hotel in China next year, what is wrong with him wanting to buy bitcoins now?

Technical Anysis of STOCK Trends, there you said it yourself... (bitcoin is not a stock)
@_date: 2013-12-16 17:30:18
You know what's funny? 99,999% of the people being stoned in Amsterdam are tourists. The dutch are just great market makers, always have been. "There's something people want to pay money for? I'll sell it!". 
The great thing is that there is no taboo about smoking weed, and you can have conversations about drugs and drug policies with your boss without them even thinking you use those drugs. Most dutch people have tried weed, but not many are stoners, exactly because it's not something 'secret'. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:23:30
The thing is, even though it might make bitcoins road ahead a bit challenging and bumpy sometimes it also gives a lot of people more reason to want it to succeed, which means it will.. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 13:55:04
Well... A stock is a company, when the value of a Stock drops 10% that's a lot more significant than if Bitcoin drops 10%
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:29:00
Still pretty annoying for the businesses that choose to take the plunge and help support bitcoin adoption.

Not all countries will follow. Countries in Europe are sick of following orders form the EU whatever it is. So there will be regulatory arbitrage over here, given that bank transfers have become European, it will be impossible to kill it here unless they kill it EU wide, which will not happen. 
Bitcoin will florish in those countries, other countries will give up their fight eventually. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:29:09
Yeah but it was much lower than $450 not so long ago, or do all the people that currently posting on r/bitcoin suffer from amnesia or did they bought all their bitocins in the last 2 months????

I'd love to reply to this comment in 3 years time :)

the code doesn't take a team of people to write it. Bitstamp has api and you can code some simple strategies with a little python script...

I live in Amsterdam, yes, I'm not Dutch. In my country more people have a weed problem exactly because it is more taboo, stoners tend to stick together and praise the mighty plant like a religion like on r/trees... While in my experience, yes a lot of Dutch people have had a period where they experimented with weed, but realized it's not really giving them much. They don't make a problem of smoking weed and you might even smoke it at their home, while they don't do it. 
The shitty food sellers and all the shops you talk about, that's EXACTLY the center of the city where nobody speaks Dutch even if you start speaking Dutch (my native language) to a Dutch person there they will still respond in English because they expect you to be a tourist. 
I laugh at all the tourists that think they experienced Amsterdam, while the only thing they've really seen is the tourist attractions that take their money :) 
 I have yet to meet a Dutch person above the age of 23 who smokes weed on a regular basis. 
Let me ask you: When you were in Amsterdam, did you actually meet any Dutch people that worked and lived in Amsterdam? Have you been to any of the bars/clubs were locals hang out (hint: not coffeeshops). I'll happily show you around when you visit next time.

commen sense. If a stock price would drop like bitcoin does, something is really threatning the future profits of the company. A company does not vanish overnight, there is a whole lot of activities underpinning the price of its stock... 
Bitcoin is not Stock in a company. Don't compare apples with musquitoes. The jargon is 'defined' and used as such in the context of stocks. If you insist on using the same jargon with the same 'definitions' as in the stockmarket, please do, but don't be surprised if others think bitcoin should not be compared to stock in that way... 
The way the bitcoin price flutuates, there are corrections happening all the time, I don't think that's what the term 'correction' is meant for... 
In very effecient markets with a lot of professional players like the stockmarket, it makes a lot more sense to speak of corrections.

If you sold a bit while it was crashing and bought back when it was a bit lower, you now have more bitcoin.
