Is it really trolling if there seriously is a point about not being able to use it as a currency? I know I sure as he'll can't, and wont use it as one because it doesn't make sense at this time.

I used coinbase a bit and it felt stupid easy to buy btc ltc and eth. Only thing I don't know is if I overpayed for my transactions to obtain said coins but I would call it fair.

 that's a lot of mechanics just to destroy bills that will most likely be in cassettes,  like an atm. The easiest way would be to ink the bills.

I was having trouble finding where to upload my file. Are you using TurboTax online or off a disk?

Honestly it's scary messing around with that. I'm a simple man,  I see a low price I buy, I see high price I hodl.

You are correct, it is not profitable, that's not what I'm looking for. I'm looking for a pool that will be good for my S2 because I want it to do work AND heat my house.

Extremely, that's why it's going in my basement under an intake duct to circulate any heated air

In my case, I'm treating them as glorified space heaters. The S2 runs about 1100w I believe,  if you picked up an electric heater with the same rating it would output the same amount of heat as the miner. 
Will it offset gas heating? Yes. Is it cost effective? No, I just want more bitcoin and winter is the only time where I can see this thing be somewhat worth running. 
Also gas is cheaper than electric for me so I will be eating up a bit up front,  but I'll have some bitcoin. I'll see how it works out soon.

I got an S2 laying around getting ready for it to help heat my house, you think that would work on this pool?
