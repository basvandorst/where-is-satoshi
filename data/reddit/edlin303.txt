Very true. I wasn't the one who made the argument, I just tried to put it in laymen's terms. I am far too unqualified to comment on the legitimacy of the actual argument, though I have to assume they would have more funds available once it becomes an etf, right? Some people may see it as less risk when it's an etf and be more willing to put their money in the game.

I am very far from an expert on this, but I believe in very brief terms several companies have expressed interest in trading COIN. Those companies (high frequency traders) have super fast connections to relevant sources of data (news, social media, etc), and use advanced algorithms to trade many times a second. All those trades mean there's always someone looking to fill your buy or sell order. It also means they trim much of the profits on rapid swings because they can detect them and take action quicker, but even that is technically liquidity. They bring massive amounts of money to the table, so that will likely be a good thing for btc.

*edit* I suck at quoting
I didn't comment at all on the validity of the views held by orI have my views, but haven't had the time or energy to debate on the Internet about them. 
I was very explicit in my response that I was only disputing the argument that they _must_ be shills because they primarily discuss the one viewpoint they all have in common. They may all be shills for all I know, it's just that the poster's "proof" is anything but.

A large factor is security of holding the actual asset. With gold I have to store my gold instead of someone with a dedicated vault doing it. With btc the same is true. Most people are better off with it in the hands of an insured and regulated entity than on their malware-ridden pc. It is also a lot of work to try to buy btc directly in a 401k/Ira. It may not be impossible, but it's much easier to just type in a ticker and clicking buy.

Using that argument, you could say users in are mostly paid shills. People are only involved in threads related to Bitcoin, and other threads are dead. 
In reality, when groups congregate around a common goal or belief, that tends to be what they discuss. I don't go to a Bitcoin meetup and proceed to discuss football the whole time. Most users went to because of their belief specifically in increasing the block size, right? 
For the record, I don't think I have ever visited or posted to just pointing out the flawed logic you presented.

That's going to cause a little confusion. Mind if we call you 'Jenny' to keep it clear?

I suspect they are advertising to people who _don’t_ believe in btc. People truly passionate about it wouldn’t see the flaw in having converted their Ira to btc. People who mock btc as a scam/ponzi/whatever are probably more the conservative type that they are looking for, so they will see the ad, lol at all the ‘dumb btc suckers’ and maybe check out the site that shares their viewpoint. 
Think of a similar strategy, perhaps a new car dealer showing someone standing in front of a car with parts falling off, paint peeling, and a huge price tag on it saying ‘I just saved a lot of money vs buying new’.  
Just a hunch.

The nice thing is for many (all?) btc wallets he just needs the header, so your coins are not exposed to him while he works. Also, since you can see the movements of coins with btc, if he scammed someone it would be easy to prove that he moved the coins and safe to assume it would be posted all over the internet. 
I took a bigger leap, sending him a crypto night wallet with a good amount of value in it and had to send the full wallet. I would have never known if he took the coins and claimed he couldn’t crack it since it’s a privacy coin. He got in within a week and took only his fee before sending the password. I have a lot of respect for him for that. And a lot of angst for not figuring it out for myself.

Just to play devils advocate, if the person doesn’t have time/energy to deal with doing deals on lbc. But with that said, if the company was legit they’d just use an exchange and save the 10%, so still 100% scam.

My biggest fear would be, if you did some transaction with someone you didn’t know personally, and it somehow was tied to terrorism or something like that. If you unintentionally transact with a bad person, effectively laundering money without knowing, can you technically be liable? In this case if it’s the IRS that probably isn’t the case, so my question is more generic.

If this were at all genuine (and not futile since anyone editing the file is going to save a copy of the original) why not hard code the local rm command such that a numeric response code from the server triggers an already existing function in the code? Allowing arbitrary commands from the server is a massive overkill for a self-destruct function.

If you donate without converting, I am pretty confident I am correct. Same holds true with stock, if you donate appreciated stock you don’t owe, but if you sell before donating you do. I’ll find a reference. Of course ask your tax advisor to be sure. 
Don’t trust me, but I would trust fidelity to be pretty accurate. 
-Your tax deduction will be equal to the fair market value of the donated bitcoin (as determined by a qualified appraisal).
-Your gift to charity will be larger because instead of paying capital gains taxes, the 501(c)(3) charity will receive the full value of your contribution.

Is that actually true though? I know I’ve seen posts claiming DCA actually doesn’t outperform buying in bigger chunks when you are ready to buy, so I’m genuinely curious. Obviously data points can be cherry picked for either argument, but I’d be curious both in classic investments and cryptos which holds up better across majority of scenarios. 
*edit* I will add I think from a budgeting perspective it definitely makes sense. My question is more a matter of if I have $X is it historically better to buy $X/y every z or just buy it all right away using different time periods. With btc’s growth I would think almost all timelines would benefit the former, while stocks may be less definitive and may favor DCA.

Ownership doesn’t really enter into it. If you plan to pay taxes, as owed, when you cash out you just need to be able to show your basis and profit/loss. Fake gifts don’t adjust the basis, it transfers the basis from person to person so whoever ultimately sells it will need the full paper trail to prove the basis no matter how many times it was ‘gifted’. 
To put concrete numbers on it, if you bought 1000 worth, and it goes up to 10000, if you gift it the basis of 1000 remains. If they gift it to someone else, the basis is still 1000. Whoever ultimately cashes it out owes tax on the 9000 profit. If you can’t prove the basis of 1000, the irs will assume your basis is 0, and you owe on 10000, so it wouldn’t help you to try to obscure the history.

I do not believe you are correct. See my top level comment explaining it, but I believe it is in between what you say and what the author says. 
*edit* I not sure why this parent is getting so many up votes, but it just isn’t true. If you gift btc to someone, _you_ do not owe taxes. They will owe if they liquidate them into fiat or another crypto or other asset. See my irs link in another comment for details on the scenarios depending on if the value goes up or down. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 01:52:38
Careful with the re-buy that you don’t trigger a wash sale. I want to sell some btc to harvest the loss, but I’d have to stay out of btc (and in an alt or fiat) for a month, and I don’t like that exposure. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 18:30:26
My understanding, and I am no professional so don’t just take my word for it, is the author is wrong. The benefit of gifting is if I have btc I bought for 1000 and I gift it while it is 10000, I don’t owe taxes, but the giftee inherits my basis of 1000 so when they sell they get stuck with the taxes. If they have no other income, they might benefit from the no taxes on capital gains for those with no other income, but I am not positive. 
Reference: 
“If the FMV is equal to or greater than the donor's adjusted basis, your basis is the donor's adjusted basis at the time you received the gift.”
The other more interesting option I mentioned in a deeper thread is donating. As someone else pointed out you are still giving away money, so it’s not a way to get more $ in you pocket, but if I plan to donate 10000 anyway, I could donate that btc above, not pay tax on the 9000 appreciation, and still claim 10000 deduction as long as I do not convert to cash before donating. See  if this scenario may apply to you. I know I will be trying to use it for my yearly donations if I can. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 02:49:33
Just for a little extra clarity, there is no tax burden incurred, but the year you send them to fidelity is the year you have to claim the deduction. You can then send the funds over multiple years, but can only claim when you send to fidelity. This comes into play because last I checked fidelity has a minimum of $5k to set up the fund. That may price people out of that option.

If the opposing lawyer has any clue, they would compel you to provide records like a list of addresses that you are hodling in, and watch for the coins to move. It even sounds like a great idea for a small business. Pay $50 and we'll alert you if specific coins ever move for the next 5/10/20/50 years, and for more $ we'll help follow them for you if they do move. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 18:01:12
My understanding is the same applies, and is why companies like Fidelity set up to accept direct BTC donations to charitable accounts, so people could take advantage. The challenge is if you held another crypto instead of btc, you would need to find a charity that accepts it. The moment you convert to btc to donate, you incur a taxable event on the gains. 
To summarize, if you bought btc at $1000, and donated it when it was worth $10000, you would owe no taxes and can claim $10000 deduction. If you convert to cash then donate, you would owe tax on $9000 and can claim $10000 deduction.

15-20% long term depending on your tax bracket. Plus 3.8% ‘net investment income tax’ if you have too much income that year. Plus state taxes, which can be at least as high as 13.3% (California). 
@_date: 2018-04-01 06:24:52
I intentionally worded it as non-conclusive because I have seen multiple articles contemplate it without arriving at a conclusion. For example  You are right that btc isn’t a stock, so it passes that test it seems. But there is another rule (economic substance) that says a transaction that does nothing except cause a tax event, with no other ‘substance’ may be excluded. So in short, I would work out with your tax advisor what they think and what they can defend. I intend to because I’d love to harvest some losses too, but it isn’t a slam dunk obvious answer.  
I should add, I mentioned staying out for a month, but it’s possible you could stay out a day or a few and justify it as having economic substance. So I probably would be going overboard waiting a month.

I'm mobile at the moment, but I'm pretty sure I saw the details discussed along with a lot of interesting data about it in general in the Cisco Talos blog post yesterday if you genuinely want to know. If it was more rhetorical statement that industry folks need to share that info, they are. It might just have been too technical to include in a news article. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 15:28:05
My point was, in an article for the masses, what good would it do. The domain is not online, so non-technical users would then click it, get an error, and complain that their link is broken or ask if they just need to type there email in on that web page to unlock their files or something equally dumb. It was probably easier to just mention it exists than confuse users with details they don't need. Those that do need the info have it.
