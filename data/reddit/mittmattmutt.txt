Hi, the general advice about this is do the following:
*Change your sterling to euro on coinbase (I don't know how much/if they charge for this, but if they do, you could put in a limit buy of some coin on gdax and then a limit sell of that same coin to euro, avoiding fees)
*Get the app revolut, which offers very good gbp-eur conversion. Link your revolut eur account to coinbase. As another poster, this step will take a few days, unfortunately.
*Withdraw your euros to the revolut account. Again, a couple of days for this.
*Convert, in revolut, the eur to gbp, and then send to your bank
It sounds complicated but really isn't. Another notably different option is localbitcoins--I've never used it, but might be quicker.

Some useful info in this--thanks for sharing.

Cool idea! Be good to see what, if anything, the wisdom of the crowd is about these questions

That's a really good question, I think (if you mean it in a somewhat deep, philosophical/technical sense). According to a textbook:
"Bitcoins are just transaction outputs" ( p69)
However, that's not very helpful if you don't know what transactions are. The way that I think of it, to possess a bitcoin is to be able to broadcast certain messages (transactions) on the blockchain. So it's something like a right, rather than a thing. However, there's room for debate and I'm very willing to be corrected by someone more knowledgeable.

There's been a delay in withdrawals (you should have an email from coinbase on 22nd December saying as much). I started a withdrawal 18th and it just arrived today: I know that's later than yours by (counting weekend) a few days, but hopefully no reason to worry just yet. Support will unfortunately be no use, but it should come.

How does that 5% rate compare with what coinbase or the other UK places offer?
I was thinking, despite the fact, as you say, that you're not *really* buying bitcoin that it might be a handy way to swingtrade without having to sit in front of an exchange  all day.

I don't know whether (and doubt) this is true, but some relevant information is that today I, as well as presumably others, got an email saying that a withdrawal I had made (on Monday) from my coinbase euro wallet to my bank account is 'delayed', and that it could take up to 10 days for it to be processed.
So, my guess is the friend of a friend experienced or heard about something similar and then--at least let's hope--drew some unwarranted conclusions.

Thanks! Was looking for something like this.

Hmm, maybe you didn't get it because your withdrawal was a bit earlier than mine and it just went to people who withdrew after a certain date...also, I heard that if your withdrawal is &lt;1k that can slow things up too. Very frustrating having your money lost in the ether like that!

I'm interested too. This isn't quite what you're asking, but here's one paper about to what extent one could view blockchain tech as 'socialist' as opposed to libertarian (I know Keynes isn't a socialist, and it doesn't speak to monetary theory, but it might be a start):

I think The Guardian in the UK are doing the same. Pretty much every day they have a new nonsense article. Today's:  (though it's a waste of time to read)

Do you use coinbase? If so, there's advice here:
It sounds complicated, but going via revolut seems to be the simplest and most economical solution at the moment (though you could check out other threads on that subreddit for other methods). I did it last week and the whole process (getting revolut account, transferring from coinbase\gdax to revolut euro account, converting to pounds, transferring to UK bank account) took only a couple of days (though it can be longer if a weekend gets in the way)

I've had a small amount of success, but I don't think I could attribute it to much more than luck. For example, around the time of the China closing exchanges news in September, and in particular after Charlie Lee tweeted a confirmation it was going to happen I sold and then progressively bought back in, and looking at my gdax receipts I see I managed to at least buy back some near the bottom of that dip. Second, I've been looking to move some money to fiat for the past month or so owing to some expenses and managed to sell a bit around the current ath. In the former case my action was based on the news; in the second, on the thought that the quick rise to 11k was unsustainable.
I don't think there's a motto to draw from this--it's just two cases, after all--but I'd like to think at least that in some cases, paying attention to either fundamental or technical facts might be helpful. That said, it's quite stressful, and not something I really plan to do frequently. Anyway, just consider these as a couple of anecdotes, nothing more.
