I've repeatedly asked their support team for any updates regarding the upcoming fork, and all their answers have been incredibly vague and unhelpful.
Will start looking for another exchange.
Thank you for your response!

Hi. Begginer here. Would appreciate your input.
So far my exchange is listed as a supporter of 2x and I have fiat there ready to buy BTC in case of a dip after the fork.
Will it be dangerous to buy BTC from them? Should I start considering moving my fiat to another exchange?

Coins.ph has such an incompetent support team. 
When I was inquiring about 2x, they kept mentioning Bitcoin Gold lol

I live in the Philippines and most of the online groups I've found only treat BTC as a get rich quick scheme. And a lot of people get duped by Cloud Mining scams.
But there are also a lot who are knowledgeable with BTC and crypto in general.

Touché, Sir. :)
I check the sub literally every hour I'm awake haha can't wait for this fork to be over and done with.

Once I get my Trezor, will the transfer from Mycelium be seamless?
Really grateful for all the helpful responses!

Gotta admit you got me there haha
I think I'm gonna like it here lol
@_date: 2017-10-14 09:31:20
Well that makes a whole lot more sense haha. Thanks you've been very helpful!
@_date: 2017-10-09 08:25:42
Yeah will definitely move my BTC to Exodus or Mycelium today and transfer it to Trezor when it arrives.

Increasing the block size as an idea itself seems nice. But what ruins everything is the people behind the fork, right? Which is why I said  I'm rooting for the lighting network..
@_date: 2017-10-29 05:07:17
When do you think the buying opportunity will present itself? Before or After the fork? Thanks for the input!

I already made several back-ups to my masterseed, so I guess I'm good then. Thank you so much for the response!
@_date: 2017-10-09 08:09:29
Thanks for the tip! Will order a Trezor wallet this week.
In the meantime, where should I keep my BTC? I feel more of an idiot for every second I keep my BTC at the exchange I use lol

I found several posts discussing the Mycelium stuff but most were dated pre-BCC so I just wanted to make sure. Sorry for coming off as lazy/entitled/ and thanks for responding anyway. :)

Oh shit it went as high as 180K?? Damn. Thanks for the info.
Actually, I have about 35% more BTC than her, yet my transaction was so much cheaper. 
We also use the same exchange and same wallet, so we were really confused. We'll have a second go and try to customize the fee. Thanks!!

Hi! I just moved my BTC to Mycelium while I wait for my Ledger.
When you said that Mycelium let's you "hold your keys", are you referring to the 12-word masterseed? Or is that something else and I need to do more steps to own my key? :)
@_date: 2017-10-09 07:40:05
Thank you for the response! Can you recommend any wallets? Right now I'm considering blockchain.info
@_date: 2017-10-15 01:41:07
"as good as Mycelium used to be"
What do you mean? Are they no longer a reliable wallet? I'm keeping my BTC in Mycelium til my Ledger arrives in 2-3 weeks. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 08:13:03
Guess we're rooting for the lightning network, then.
Thanks for the response!!

I tried to catch the bottom during the China FUD. Went to sleep when the price was 3.1k and woke up to 3.8k. Still kicking myself for not buying before bed. Haha. 
So yeah, I'll try to be less greedy on the next dip. Looks like we're about to break a new ATH now (6.1k as I write this), but still hoping to see the correction before the fork.
Thanks for your input!
