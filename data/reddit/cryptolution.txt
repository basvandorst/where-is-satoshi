Well, sounds like they are doing the tons of hassle part right.


If they are implying they need to have multiple people go through multiple systems like this physically just to sign a transaction, then no one is getting those coins.
I think it would be a lot easier just to have those same servers (in the vault) on a LAN with good security in-office combined with good IT security so that it would require physical access to a terminal connected to the LAN that talks to the keyserver.
The only way in would be for someone to be physically present at the terminal trying to find a vurn into the LAN based keyserver.
It would be super cool there was a 2FA for routers, so that you had to authenticate at a low level for network traffic as well as a OS.
Or, just use 3 trezors and forget all the AI robots with lasers and traps and just stick with building a big wall.

This only shows how immature and out of touch with reality you are. Lower overdose rates is one of the best indicators we have of actual usage rates. Deaths, we can tally officially and accurately. Do you think that we can just go around asking people to take online quizes on their drug use? Assuming we did do such a thing, do you really think that the results would be accurate, let alone something that we could publish scientifically for government purposes?
Are you addicted to the following:

Which is exactly why I made the post. We saw 7k of margin lending on BFX within 36 hours of the hack. Now to me in my mind, that does not make the point because no one should be crazy enough to open a short on the market that was to be drained. You would not put your eggs in the basket that you know is going to be dropped.
But there was a lot of activity on other exchanges at the same time. The question in my mind was the short initiated on BFX and the rest of the market responded to that? Or was the short initiated on other exchanges (Huboi, BTCC, etc) and BFX was a response to that?
If it was started on BFX and then everywhere else was just the market responding, then my theory on this particular incident would be found lacking. If it started elsewhere then my theory would be found wanting.

The majority of illicit trade is done through the banking system, through various legal ju jitsu with offshore accounts, corporations, "charities", "scholarships", "life insurance policies" etc.
We know this because the banks have been caught red handed taking *billions* in cartel money.
The majority of *terrorism financing* is also through the traditional banking system, through wealthy oil nation states that are sympathetic to extreme religious viewpoints.
Banning cash will not hinder any of these rackets from operating. Which means that 99% of illicit trade, even if cash were banned, would continue as usual.  So we get rid of $100 bills. Ok, is 5 20's somehow less money? Will the banks not accept deposits for 5,000 in 20's vs 5,000 in 100's ?  Since the majority of illicit proceeds are laundered through traditional techniques, cash based businesses, then how will this stop them from depositing 20's instead of 100's? The banks will continue to accept their deposits because these are "legitimate" businesses that keep "records" and file taxes.
The entire conversation is really ignorant. 
If you want to fix the problem then you should decriminalize drugs. This would immediately be a death stroke to cartels, which would immediately reduce death, crime and large scale government corruption. We know this is effective because we've seen what happens to addiction rates and overdeath rates when you make drugs legal, as in Portugal  - The rates plummet.
We've also seen what happens when you legalize cannabis here in the states, or at the least create a medical marijuana platforms in bordering states - The mexican cartels abandon marijuana manufacturing as their product can no longer meet the standards of what enterprising Americans can grow, legally, and their profit margins are choked down to the point that they must abandon the enterprise.
In regards to terrorism funding, there's not much we can do about that since the nation states that are funding these terrorist enterprises are operating within the legal spectrum of banking. The only way we can eliminate terrorism funding is to eliminate banks, or eliminate a couple hundred million humans in these states that practice this religion. Im sure there are plenty of crazy American's who want this. Since thats not going to happen we need to accept that the problem will exist so long as these nation states are made wealthy *through oil*.
So to me the long term solution is to invest as much public subsidy as we can into creating alternative energy solutions.  We must shell shock oil so that it becomes worth as little as possible.
Fracking, though I despise the practice, has some silver linings in that it has took a huge chunk of change away from the oil barons of the east. The cost though is higher than the damage of these countries staying rich. No matter how many people terrorists kill, it pales in comparison to how many lives of all living beings will perish due to carbon emissions. When terrorists start getting their hands on nukes, or new types of weaponry just as catastrophic, is when we have to really worry.

Whether they store it in 2 different buildings, or in different countries around the world, it makes zero difference. If you want to design it to be purposefully difficult to be compliant, then that is the fault of the business planners.


How hard is it to have the keys stored in a safety deposit box at a local bank? You can have duplicate copies stored in safety deposit boxes around the world for redundancy if you like, but there's no reason to not have local copies. If you are really paranoid about the bankers stealing your keys then split the keys at local branches, multiple cities if you are extra paranoid. Thats well within reach for a process that only needs to be done 2-4 times a year.
Your argument is that because they've done it "x" way that they should be let off the hook. Well sorry, that's a piss poor argument.  Im very sorry its "inconvenient" to preform a cryptographic proof of reserves function that every single custodian business in the bitcoin space should be doing.
Thats like saying you didn't lock the door because you stashed your keys in some weird hard to reach place. Then your house gets broken into and who do you blame? Well its your own fault for putting your keys in a obscene place to the point that you didn't even bother to lock the door. The only idiot to blame is yourself, not the situation.

no party, not even the Bank can link the withdrawal of

Yea, thats what I was afraid to hear. 
Im assuming that the connection was lost, and while it showed the information in your browser (because the code was being ran in browser), it did not sync with their server.
Thats a really shitty story, but I think its a story that is to be learned of java-in-browser code in general, and not specifically about bc.i. Despite that, I would think that they could implement some logic, such as show balance as grey until synced, and once synced show balance in blue.
The moral of the story is really always hit refresh and make sure your connection is synced with the server before exiting the application.

Well that is some shitty logic. So because they've made it purposefully hard to prove that they hold the money they claim to hold, we are supposed to let them off the hook? I dont even buy that they've done all that anyways, what you are doing is just throwing up smoke.


Ok, since you seem to struggle with reality let me be more clear. Proof of cryptographic solvency is the *only* way that we can truly trust a financial statement. History has shown us endlessly that companies will lie through their teeth right up until the moment that they tell everyone that they are defunct.
Coinbase being insolvent would be a black eye for bitcoin. Whether thats rational or not does not matter, it would be used as negative media, negative speculation against bitcoin, which would cause a plummet of its value. Coinbase is a *HUGE* company in the space.

But aside from comedic value, I was merely pointing out a logical inconsistency. Nothing is global warming future proof. There is just change and each part of the world experiences it in its own way. If you meant to imply that Alaska would still be quite habitable after some serious global warming, I would be inclined to agree with you. Though, I actually *do* worry on the impacts of glacial melt on northern territories, and thats a scientifically evaluated fear. There are actually flooding catastrophes going on around the world this very moment due to global warming.

If this takes off, I think we can expect future computer manufacturers to implement either a mining design or a hardware signing device at some point down the road.
Having that hardware be flexible with some type of scripting language would be beautiful. Being able to store say, $50 of btc and telling it to not process transactions of more than 0.001, and that if more than 10 transactions in X amount of time are processed to hit a flood stop would allow you to setup auto-signing without worry of hackers penetrating your system and draining your wallet.

TumbleBit + ShufflePuff = ShuffleTumbleDore?
Lets make them evolve!
I really want to understand the differences between these two new techs. The [Q&amp;A with Daniel Krawisz on ShufflePuff]( was great, I think I get shufflepuff, time to dig into TumbleBit's Whitepaper!
EDIT - After reading the whitepaper, it seems that TumbleBit is superior to ShufflePuff...or at least the protocol shufflepuff is based on, CoinShuffle. Im unsure if shufflepuff has fixed some of these drawbacks. Goes into details -


vulnerable to DoS attacks where a user joins the mix and then aborts, disrupting the protocol for all other
users. Decentralization also makes it easy for an attacker to create many Sybils and trick Alice A into mixing
with them in order to deanonymize her payments [13], [54]. Moreover, Bitcoin’s maximum transaction size
(100KB) limits these systems to 538 users per mix. Also, because these systems are decentralized, mix users
interact via a peer-to-peer network in order to identify each other and mix payments. This need for coordination
between users causes communication to grow quadratically [12], [13], limiting scalability; neither [50]
nor [41] performs a mix with more than 50 users. TumbleBit sidesteps these scalability limitat
TumbleBit's White Paper abstract -


through an untrusted intermediary called the Tumbler. TumbleBit’s anonymity properties are similar to classic
Chaumian eCash: no one, not even the Tumbler, can link a payment from its payer to its payee. Every payment
made via TumbleBit is backed by bitcoins, and comes with a guarantee that Tumbler can neither violate anonymity, nor steal bitcoins, nor “print money” by issuing payments to itself. We prove the security of TumbleBit using the real/ideal world paradigm and the random oracle model. Security follows from the standard RSA assumption and ECDSA unforgeability. We implement TumbleBit, mix payments from 800 users and show that TumbleBit’s offblockchain payments can complete in seconds.
Looks like the TumbleBit whitepaper goes to analyze various mixing services! Even a nice infographic on [page 3 of the whitepaper](

Yes but the API = internet, where xapo is requiring physical turnkey access.  So there does not seem to be any issue with xapo's setup. Assuming they really do require multiple people in multiple physical locations to go to a offline computer to sign the tx. 
I think it would be just as effective to have 3 people in various places sign the tx with their trezors, and they can save a million a year on IT security. Only a state authority could manage to subvert a 3/5 multisig by taking hostage 3 different people and forcing them to sign.

It would be even cooler if we could turn a node into some sort of game, where incoming transactions and connections create battles, be one items, earn you XP, etc. I like the uptime bit, that should definitely be a XP raking action.

I would like to make a request.


Please change the default fee represented to be that to confirmed **within the next block** instead of *next 2 blocks*.
I think that most people who are interested in adjusting their fee will do so to maintain that their transaction is included in the next block, not the 2nd, or 3rd or any thereafter.
By making the default behavior the next 2 blocks you are creating a unrealistic data point that fits a narrative. Who would care about the 2nd block as opposed to the next block? You might as well say the 5th block or *X*th block for all that it matters, if your not in the next block I dont think time is a concern for you and so whether its 2 blocks or 10 blocks wont make a difference. 
For users who are using bitcoin to buy goods/services and are waiting for a confirmation before a payment processor confirms the transaction, 2 blocks means that their transaction is probably going to time out, which leads to all sorts of frustrating customer experiences since now they have to contact BOTH the payment processor and the retailer and work through it to get the invoice funded.
If you would like, please continue adding fee data as a footnote for the 2nd block, 3rd block or as many thereafter as you desire, but please adjust the fee to represent the next block.

A regular SQL database can be taken over rather easily, values changed, data dumped, etc. All you would need is root access, which could be acquired through any number of millions of exploits.
A "blockchain database" aka BankChain(instead of a blockchain PoW system like bitcoin) is one that relies on public/private key cryptography. Since these banks are not trying to create a currency, and are only using it as a ledger with perhaps a federated structure (only a certain number of signatories are given read/write access), they are not worried about double spends and therefore don't need a proof of work.
Understand that even if someone gains root access to their network, it would be questionable whether they could even obtain write access without a properly setup banking blockchain. If I were a administrator, I would make it that only certain keys could have write access, and with public key crypto this is very easy to setup. Even if they set it up to allow a more global write access to its members, a hacker would still have to compromise the private signing keys to make any transactions to the Bankchain.
This is a *very large* advancement for the global banking community. This means that they would be able to settle books/transactions in real time, as the moment they sign the transaction to be written to the ledger then everyone else on the network's balance sheets would immediately update reflecting the change.
That means that a lot of the advantages bitcoin offers will be moot. Banks are going to get international wire transfers, domestic transfers, real estate escrow, and insert anything to do with money transfering here, to be done in almost real time, killing any of the previous 'wait times' that we had.
This is going to change the world.
This will also take care of a lot of "bugs" in the market, such as fradulent balance sheets that are created through short selling (as with overstock), and with any funny numbers in which there appears to be more paper assets than there are real assets because of the complexity of the system.
Even if bitcoin fails (which I dont think it will), it will at least have spurred the banking industry to make these changes that will have a positive impact on the world.
The great part about this is that the more blockchain tech that is built, the more interoperability there will be between these BankChains and bitcoin. We will establish side chains and other layers that will eventually bridge the gap between all these alternative-chain's, allowing for interchain settlement. Sure, there will be higher regulatory requirements for services that bridge these chains, but there will also be more potential and endless advancement of bitcoin tech to come along, to build in privacy and fungibility to make cross transfers less risky from a regulatory standpoint.

You guys see all the behemoths behind this company, and supporting the TPP? Its shaming.


Anyone else agree with this? I would like to think that despite America creating the technology, that it clearly has become global in scope, and no single country has right of ownership over the internet, and definitely not defining the internet as a "American Export".
For those shaking their heads in confusion, lets attempt to work through this. First, what is a export?


So, trying to define the internet as a "American Export" is like trying to classify it as a commodity -


Is the internet a raw material or product that can be shipped to another country? Well, obviously no. Well what about in respect to labor? If someone does labor on the internet for another country/foreign company, is it considered a export? I would disagree...


So, can anyone make heads or tails of this? Specifically, *how* the internet could be perceived as a export? Seems to me that any labor done domestically would be considered domestic labor, not a export. Perhaps they are trying to say that people who use american internet services are collecting exported services? That doesn't fit the bill either.
I despise my country at times.

I suppose that satisfies my question for knowledge on this particular subject, and is in alignment with my understanding of onion routing, but I suppose must assume that the network is established and that the channels are established to allow for this type of routing to occur.
Im curious how onion routing will occur on LN if the channels are not established. Would one of the routing nodes establish the channel automatically, or would onion routing simply not be possible under these conditions?

You are neither the authority of bitcoin, nor the authority of Etymology. Coming in here and dictating the terms of a definition is absurd.
Consensus will continue to be used in the way it was meant both pre *and* post bitcoin. It simply means "general agreement" and trying to claim otherwise is living in a bubble and pretending everything inside your bubble is perfect and that everyone else should accept the conditions of your inner-bubble.
Every single developer on bitcoin has used the term consensus at one point or another in the general sense. To claim otherwise is outlandish.
Please stop trying to force other people to your narrow technical viewpoints. They may apply in a technical conversation, but in this situation, which is a discussion of politics, it absolutely applies correctly the way it was used by Gavin.

@_date: 2016-04-07 04:02:57


Not negative, simply realistic from my POV.


The issue is very big and complex, but to make it as tiny as possible the issue is that we've built this massive network and core devs have decided that its going to be a *settlement* layer instead of a payment layer, and to hell what any of the users thinks.
I imagine what will happen is that with the launch and usage of LN, transactional fee's for the regular blockchain are going to become enormously bloated. The mindset of our society is going to change from "The blockchain is for everyone" to "the blockchain is only for large settlements or people who want to pay a extreme price for privacy".
Which is fundamentally flawed and against the original vision of bitcoin, *in my opinion.*


Have you seen the code? *[Edit - Apparently he has lol! rekt.]* Other than the few people who may be working on it this moment. 
But one thing seems obvious to me, but maybe not to others who do not understand technology. Maybe im wrong about this, but, onion routing that relies on a payment channel does not have privacy between you and that channel. So if there are supernodes, and those are the main hubs for connectivity, then those hubs will immediately destroy any privacy you think you may have won from onion routing.
Because a lot of these nodes will be large companies that have to remain compliant to KYC/AML laws. 
Am I wrong here ? If so, please feel free to discuss and to put me at ease. I want to believe in the project and the vision, but I see a lot of issues at the moment.

Are you so sure about that? Seems to me that there is a more likely explanation. The judges who *could* have authorized it *refused to do so* because they saw what a mockery of legality it was, and then the FBI went to a magistrate, hoping that no one would notice that the order was not authorized by the correct level. This sort of executive ju-jitsu is not so uncommon and has occurred at the highest level, directly from the president trying to pull this shit -
When the Attorney General refused Bush on a NSA wiretapping approval they tried to get Ashkroft to sign it from his hospital bed to bypass the system. In the end the administration ended up doing it without any authorization, despite being highly illegal, which resulted in almost a entire executive cabinet walking out on the job from Bush.
"At the hearing, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who was leading the questioning, asked the following. “So in sum, it was your belief that Mr. Gonzales and Mr. Card were trying to take advantage of an ill and maybe disoriented man to try and get him to do something that many, at least in the Justice Department, thought was against the law? Was that a correct summation?”
Comey answered directly. “I was concerned that this was an effort to do an end-run around the acting attorney general and to get a very sick man to approve something that the Department of Justice had already concluded — the department as a whole — was unable to be certified as to its legality. And that was my concern.”

.....What? What a absurd line of thinking. Are you really making the argument that people would build a PS2H transaction *out of convenience* ? Have you ever built a PS2H transaction? If you have, then you would know that its not a non-technical process.
It requires technical know-how and thats something that *most* users do not have. *Most* users need a wallet that allows them to put a destination, amount, and click send. And we are *nowhere near that for PS2H transactions*. More assumptions. not surprised at all of course.


Which....*again*....4x improvement on what? 1% of the networks transactions? Ooohhhh WOW! Im crapping my pants in excitement on all these discounts and space savings! 


"Best" is a relative term. Its definitely a wonderful feature that should be used as much as possible. Yet, we live in a real world with real people. You seem to forget this in all of your assumptions on this perfect little world your mind likes to live in, ignoring the real friction that occurs.
Others are free to do as they wish *within each of their own respective capabilities* ....which again, you've conveniently left out of you unrealistic assumptions on the way the world works.
I can make this very simple for you.
You walk around in a city, and find a 100 bitcoin users. For the sake of the argument we are going to assume thats even possible, which at the moment may not be. But lets assume it is possible.
You find these 100 people, how many of them do you think *actually know* how to craft a PS2H transaction?

RIP privacy.
So, first they say they dont see any reason for "supernodes" to exist, and then on the other side of the mouth they say they think main btc companies will operate LN hubs as a loss leader? But since LN hubs dont need any real substantial funding to operate, because they will just be computers on a network, then that means they can essentially operate for free, assuming the internet connection is already being paid for and the hardware is extra's. So just the electricty that the PC needs monthly? Not so much of a loss leader as it is a altruistic action, which im sure plenty of people will do as a lot of node operators are doing it altruistically (like me). 
How does that not equate to a scenario of supernodes?
Why would anyone *not* use these main providers when they will have established channels for optimum routing and zero fee's? 
The existence of these authoritarian nodes to bootstrap the network (I think thats appropriately named) would discourage competition and defeat the incentive model before it can have time to establish itself.

Please show me where I stated otherwise. I believe you've made a assumption on my position. Im as pro-bitcoin, anti-banker as they come, but part of being level-headed is examining without bias as much as possible. Which is why I went through the effort to look at the advantages that a BankChain can offer to the current, and very outdated, banking industry.


The banks dont have endless funding? I would disagree within reason. My comment was not intended to be taken literally, as in they can create quadrillions of assets out of thin air, but anyone with a firm understanding of the banking system does understand that *they do create money out of thin air* and have hundreds of years of monopolistic control over the monetary system to funnel *any and all* of its R&amp;D.
The amount of money needed to build a system hypothesized by my original post is not even in the millions. We are talking maybe 6 figures, a few 6 figures at most. 
Thats literally pennies to the establishment we are discussing here.
And that is the insight you should take away from this conversation. Money solves a lot of problems, especially problems that are engineering related. If you think we can build a 17 mile laser beam track to bounce photon's off each other to determine the nature of reality, but *cannot* overcome reasonably simplistic engineering problems compared to the above example, then you are completely out of touch with reality.

This entire fallacy that you've built your paradise on is incredibly thin and unstable. You've built your entire *assumption* on the fact that it instantly double's capacity for people who use it.
....Except that's not true. Its not true because the real number is somewhere between 1.3-1.7x, *not* double, and more importantly that 1.7x capacity increase is *for multisignature transactions*......
So, how much of the network exists today as multisignature transactions? Do you even know? I love how you conveniently ignore this data to build your assumptions on this massive increase thats simply not going to be present *until years from now*.....
Yet here we are, *in the now*.....not years from now. The real data that exists today about our transactional thoroughput is what is relevant *in the moment*. And P2SH? A fraction of the network usage.
What you should really be saying is "Users will instantly get around a 1.3x increase", because thats the *maximum* space savings thats going to occur for regular transactions. You know, like....the vast vast majority of our network? Rome wasn't built in a day and your ridiculous ascertations that the network is going to see these overnight instant benefits is absolutely infuriating.

Its not. Im asking you a valid question. You are making assumptions about the discounts that are going to be applied to the network without acknowledging the real facts. The real facts are the most discounts are being applied to PS2H. Yet PS2H only accounts for a fraction of the transactional usage.
Since you like to throw around numbers like your a boss, why dont you reconcile with reality, and approach the facts like a real human being, *and answer the fucking question*. I dont want to attack you, so stop avoiding the question and just answer it. Its obvious that you realize that by answering it you will defeat all of your assumptions and then how will you stand yourself and deal with all the rationalizations you've made incorrectly?
Answer the question.


You're annoying and my tone gets this way with you. Its not most people, its not even some people, its mostly *you* that rubs me the wrong way with all your fallacies and know-it-all attitude as you brandish *incorrect information* as if it were truth.


You did not answer my question. I did **not** ask you "How many people can send to a PS2H address", I asked you **how many of them do you think actually know how to craft a PS2H transaction?**
The issue is not about people using a regular wallet that will send to a PS2H created address, but that people themselves cannot create PS2H transactions themselves. You expect people to use PS2H without knowing how to use it? Where do you think all of these magical PS2H transactions are going to come from? You DO realize that PS2H transactions have more inputs and outputs and that they are therefore MUCH larger than regular transactions, **right?** You *do* realize that the reason PS2H transactions can be "compressed" more is *because they **are more** ....riiiiight? Seriously, have you never created a PS2H transaction? It sounds like you've never done it. If you had, you would know what hoops you have to jump through to create the transaction. 
There you go. Go ahead, go create a new PS2H transaction. Then once your done, tell me how many people you think you could walk up to on the street that would know how to craft a PS2H transaction.
Its not a strawman, its a fair question. I used the walking up to people on the street analogy because this is a bitcoin subreddit and obviously there are inordinate amount of technical people that frequently visit here, so the uptake on people being able to know how to craft a raw tx using PS2H is going to be inaccurately higher here. So instead, finding "normal" bitcoin users, as in, regular people from society chosen at random is a obviously more fair way to choose a fair assessment.
Of course, I dont expect you to see something so obvious as that. Instead you want to avoid the question and wiggle your way out of answering it directly, or answering it incorrectly so that you can maintain your illogical position.


No one cares about your estimation. Real developers, including sipa himself, have stated that they project segwit uptake will be conservative and that the discount is to be more around 1.3-1.4 range until longer range adoption (6+ months). This is coming from the horses mouth directly, I talked to him on IRC about it. **And thats STILL ignoring the fact that most of the discount comes from PS2H, not from regular transactions**.

How specifically is it bad news? 
Bitcoin is a technology who's purpose is to create a **new** financial system **outside** existing systems. Its purpose is to *disintermediate* traditional financial entities, allowing for citizens to bypass the middle man and trade directly with each other.
Stripe is one of these middle men. They were looking to create a market by profiting off inserting themselves between the end users.
How is that good for bitcoin? Thats like attaching a horse to Lamborghini and claiming your "Doing a great service for the automotive industry".
No thanks, I'll continue to advocate that bitcoin users transact directly with each other without a middle man taking a chunk of the money.
The fact that this is the 2nd most upvoted comment demonstrates how the majority of people here don't have a freaking clue about bitcoin or what its purpose to society is.
Bitcoin was designed to make companies like stripe and coinbase obsolete. Stop trying to pander to the old system, we have a radical new system that does not need permission.

What I would really appreciate, if you know, is under what conditions does SW offer space savings, and what are the projected savings? You mention 1.7x with a "mix of transactions". Im assuming this to mean that with "up to 4x" savings with P2SH SW transactions combined with non-P2SH SW style transactions that it roughly equates to 1.7x. Is this accurate?
And, under what conditions do we see a 4x compression? What conditions for 3x compression? Is this all about the number of signatures? So for example is a 15 signature PS2H transaction going to receive the most compression benefit from SW and 2 of 2 the least?


Is that still accurate in terms of maximum signatures for one P2SH tx?
With regards to everything else you've stated, I understand. I know people are going to use LN, though whether people "want to use multisig" is a relevant discussion. I think that its a better application of the technology because its safer in a lot of commerce applications, but it also introduces extra complexity and in some instances can create risk, such as a party not wishing to sign off on the transaction and causing the funds to stall forever, or other party looses key, etc. I understand these risks *can* be potentially mitigated through time lock, but technical capability and practical usages are two different things.
Like all things, there's a balance in the usage with benefits and negatives. What im trying to do is evaluate the direction that things are going and trying to understand the nature of capacity and usage so that I can know better, and speak better, to the issues.

The attack vector can be mitigated through hardware, or multiple pieces of hardware. Im pretty sure a multi-billion dollar corporation can fund some custom solutions too.
As already explained, twice I believe, its doubtful that they would use a non-hardware system and expose their private keys. 
As for low volume vs high volume, its pretty reasonable to assume settlement layers will be low to mid volume, not high. Either case, im sure they will develop solutions. They literally have endless funding.

I was not aware of this fact, and considering that bitcoin/blockchain tech VC funding is rivaling the internet infrastructure shows how prone for ripe disruption this technology really is.
To put it in perspective, VC's are funding at 1/3rd the power that they were in 2000. Yet we are equal in terms of funding received for bitcoin/blockchain equivalent to funding the internet in the 90's.
It kinda makes it seem like the bitcoin/blockchain tech is 3x more deserving of funding, or possibly that VC's are overvaluing 3x mor  blockchain/bitcoin tech.

Now its filled with everyones grandma trying to make a quick buck speculating on the latest shitcoins.
The change is massive, but both expected and normal. When a new technology goes mainstream, especially one with a high learning bar like bitcoin, its normal for people to under appreciate the underlying technology and to instead focus on the things they do understand and care about.

You've spent time responding to this and giving a lot of data, so I want to do you the courtesy of digesting it and responding in kind, but its late where I am. I just wanted to say thank you for taking the time and I will respond in more detail tomorrow.
But to settle the issue, no, I am not looking at it from one dimension.


Im not trying to create a irrational assumption on the reality of nodes capabilities. I only made a statement that research has shown that *right now, this moment* we could upgrade the blocksize to 4mb and that 90% of the nodes will still be able to function just fine.
Yes, there are obvious improvements we need to make with the p2p code for miners, and fortunately we have very intelligent people working on these issues. I also dont agree with applying a global policy dictated to china. You do not design your network with a bottleneck built-in. You design for much greater thoroughput, and the you adapt the bottlenecks around their issues. You do not cater to the weakest link. 
You quoted this maxwell quote to me...


When I never implied or argued that we should increase the blocksize to a unreasonable amount. 
I think 4mb is great. The developers of LN also want bigger blocks. Thats blockstream employee's included. Its essential to their projection functioning efficiently. No, im not suggesting we slam the network into overdrive, but there is pretty substantial research to support the conclusion that this fear mongering about decentralization over a 1mb blocksize raise is just that...fear mongering.
The network tomorrow would handle a 2mb upgrade just fine. There would be little losses in decentralization, if any at all.
Im not a advocate for unrestricting the blocksize. It may work, it may not, i dont know but im not willing to bet the entire project on it. 
And no, I do not have any fundamental confusion on the issue. Nothing you pasted in your response is new information to me.

Large businesses using segwit isn't part of adoption? I get that the bitgo consolidation skewed the data, but isn't that the whole point? If they had not used segwit it would have been at a massive cost to themselves in fees, and to the network in extra bytes.
I feel like you may just be trying to be technically accurate here, missing the trees for the forest, while all the haters are blindly upvoting it just because its negative.
Imagine how much the % will jump when bc.i and coinbase adopt. Will that also not be measured the same just because they are actually using SW to batch? Seems senseless semantics that only muddies up the conversation.

Going from $100 to $1000 was just as hard as going from 1k to 10k, and will be the same friction (in terms of velocity of price) going from 10k to 100k.
At $100, going up $10 was difficult, just like going from $1,000 to $1,100 was difficult. As the price gets larger, so does the velocity rate at which the pricepoint moves.
The reason this occurs is because of the constant influx of new money supply. The velocity of that money supply is equal to the velocity of the rate change. When we were at $100 we might have only had 100M, and then at $1000 we had 1B, and then at 10k we have 100B. This supply of capital will continue to grow exponentially as the market takes off. We are **far** from saturation, and [market research]( indicates that we are only half way through our technology maturation curve, meaning less than half way through a capital investment cycle.
Im open to the idea of being wrong, but watching these markets for 5 years has shown me the truth of this. Not very many people were around when bitcoin was sub $100, and my perspective is based on real world data.

It was not a reference to LN. It was a reference to a regular P2SH transaction. So yes, of course it can happen :)
Thank you for broadening my understand of the compression capabilities. I wish I knew more specifics. Under what conditions do we get x amount of compression, is my biggest curiosity.
To make this a more broad layman understanding, could we just think of it that transactions that require more signature data will have the most compression under SW since SW creates a new data container specifically for signatures?

Why would this scenario require a 3rd party? You can sync your wallet across multiple devices, 3rd party never needed.

Sorry but I don't agree with you. Maybe you want to live in a society where facts don't matter and anything that you disagree with is "fake news", but I would rather have a society where journalistic integrity is actually something that is utilized by well funded organizations.
The greater issue is that we have eroded/eliminated regulations that prevent monopolies from cornering the media market. Something that republicans do with their dying breath, something something deregulation something something better place.
Except its not. 
These are the actions of a republican lead organization.
The ironic thing is that there would be no complaints about the MSM if it were not for the deregulation boner republicans have that created this massive centralized problem as it exists today. Had they not eliminated the Fairness doctrine act in 1987 we would still have a fair playing field in the media industry, providing for much better media.

Yes, and this has long been a concern of mine. We really need secure blackbox hardware solutions for LN. It would be super cool for someone to make a custom LN node box with custom hardware that is not vulnerable to typical exploits.

I agree. It cannot prevent tampering of entries. But you also cannot re-create a cryptographic signature or alter the signature. So if you have a decentralized database, or semi-decentralized database (bankchain), then you will have multiple checkpoints to compare with and tampering with one DB will not effect the others, unless they have been stupid enough to sync all changes without extensive rules in place.


I addressed this issue with my above explanation. If there are only a certain number of signatures that can broadcast transactions, then the network will not accept any non-signed transactions.
A attacker could only re-create blocks if they also compromised the signers keys. One would hope a billion dollar banking cartel could manage some reasonable hardware based transaction management flow to prevent the compromising of such a scenario.
Its of course possible, but if done right it would be very difficult.


Cryptographic keys/signatures cannot be emulated. If a system is built with the correct set of rules and permissions it would be extremely difficult to rework any blocks with any data that would be validated by the rest of the network.

This is the reality we face. Corrupt central operators working in the bitcoin space are now actively engaged in trying to sabotage bitcoin.
Im unsure if this is a good intentions pave the road to hell scenario or if these people really do have ulterior motives, but it doesn't matter their actions are having direct negative consequences upon the ecosystem.
People like Brian Armstrong, Stephen Pair and Roger Ver should exit the bitcoin industry entirely and focus on their pet projects and stop trying to sabotage it from the inside.
Bitcoin exists as a decentralized system to disintermediate central systems. Its sole existence is intended to make entities like coinbase, bitcoin.com and bitpay.com go the way of the dodo.
The mere existence of these central agencies is both a boon and a curse. Yes, it has allowed for shorter term adoption in masse, but prematurely and before the system was ready for prime time.

The bottleneck on the network is RAM + CPU, **not** storage/bandwidth. So by taking satoshi's context and cherry picking it to suite this narrative, you are (via proxy) strawmanning the conversation by making this about bandwidth.
I want you to imagine for just one second what would happen to the bitcoin network **today** if it needed 100GB of bandwidth to propagate across a **broadcast** system.
Maybe you are not technically inclined enough to understand what that would actually entail, so im going to attempt to break down this number into something more palatable, and then extrapolate that into something meaningful.
Right now the network only distributes about 144MB of blockchain data per **day**, and thats not even taking into consideration the fact that this is a *broadcast* network where data is repeated over and over until nodes have all gotten the data. So 144mb is probably more like 140,440mb if you measure all the broadcast data (this is a wild guess, I have no idea how much extra data the broadcast network actually brings)  As it stands, at this very moment, its nearly impossible to run a node with 1GB of RAM. You have to castrate it to such a extent that you might as well not run it at all since its not really serving a purpose. So right now we are really at a 2GB *minimum* RAM requirement in order for a node to function, and with the mempool as large as its been lately even that has made 2GB RAM nodes not so efficient.
Now, I want you to think about what would happen to the network if we multiplied the current overhead by x10. So, instead of 144mb we would need 1,440MB. And then imagine how much wasteful repetition of that 1,440MB there is via broadcast system.
Just this level of jump right there would require a much beefier rig to run a node to process these transactions, utxo and blocks. Maybe a 16GB gaming PC could hold up...maybe not.
How many Venezuelans, Africans or other 3rd world countrymen do you know that use a $1,000 + gaming PC to run bitcoin nodes? Thats more than their annual average salary btw.
What makes bitcoin ultimately valuable is its ability to protect wealth. Bitcoin cannot protect wealth if it is not decentralized. Bitcoin cannot remain decentralized if it requires this level of industry grade hardware to run a node. Bitcoin cannot remain decentralized if poor people cannot run nodes.
Satoshi was a smart dude, but he was clearly out of his element when it came to game theory on decentralization + attack vectors related to distributed systems. Hal was superior to satoshi in this.
Satoshi also said this...


That right there **proves beyond any reasonable doubt** that satoshi did not have forward vision on decentralized security. No sane security admin would build a **decentralized** system that is reliant upon a **centralized** server setup.
Another thing to keep in mind when you are cherry picking Satoshi quotes is that when satoshi said this stuff in 2009, Moore's law was still in effect. But around 2010, Moore's law stopped behaving in a way we expected, or I should say the outcome of Moore's law stopped creating the result we expected.
We, as consumers/technologists, assumed that Moore's law (the doubling of transistor capacity every 18 months) would continue to *double* the speed of these processors, and therefore cut the cost in half every 18 months, give or take.
Except that stopped happening. We stopped doubling the preformance. If you look at the data, the transistor doubling factor continued post 2010, but the preformance gains we expected from this law did not continue to double with it!
So satoshi assumed that Moore's law would continue to bring us faster and faster processors and hopefully denser packed memory modules, allowing us to have 2x cpu and 2x RAM every 18 months. But that didn't happen.
So stop relying upon a outdated assumption model to support your narrative. 
**Satoshi was wrong** and everyone needs to get over it. Dude's not a god he's a human and every human makes faulty predictions. He got *most* of it right, I think, but this is *obviously* a issue he got wrong.
LN scales bitcoin the same way we had to scale the internet from broadcast ethernet to tcp/ip. This will allow layering of resources and routing of information. Its obviously going to take time to adopt the network, but it took time to adopt the internet. Im not so concerned and I know that the good technology will win over time....

I would agree, that is a idea with catastrophic consequences. We cannot use the mempool like that, it is abusing a narrow resource. I've just always assumed there would be some type of LN "mempool" where nodes would store transaction info about payments for a certain time before falling out of memory. Seems this would need to be a standard feature most clients have in order for it to work.

So, a miner has to include the lowest fee in the block header so that we have data from the miners side that can be utilized buy algorithms to better predict the price of fees.
But since miners can construct as many transactions as they want at whatever value they want to include into the blocks that they mine doesn't this just give them another tool to manipulate fee pricing?

While I agree with this I can also concede the topic at hand is not about low-liquidity alt's, but instead about high liquidity alts that have gained massive market share.
Ripple is the only one that im *really* suspect about. Research [in the past]( has demonstrated a 99% + pre-mine for ripple. Its also really stupid to speculate on IOU's (thats all ripple is). It would be like buying coupons above their "face value", meaning the discount that they offer towards a product. Ripple is a IOU system, its token is mean to facilitate frictionless trade.
How can the price (and therefore marketcap) be relevant when its artificially controlled by a supply side restriction that is due to massive concentration of assets to a central entity?
Bitcoin is no different in that the price can raise very fast because of supply side restriction (HODL!) but at least its not a pre-mine and the assets are spread across a organic (mostly free) market.
But what about ETH, Cardano, IOTA and the like? We've seen alt's with functional promise enter the scene, and whether or not this functional utility has been fully demonstrated or not is irrelevant....people *believe* it will show this utility and therefore are investing on future potential. And these are not premines.
I run a small facebook group with a lot of friends and friends of friends, and its a very frustrating process because most of these people missed the bitcoin train, so they are hyped on alt-coins because they think its their missed opportunity come again. So they rattle on about pump and dump schemes and speculate on shitcoins.
And some of these alts actually will be that opportunity! We cannot dismiss that reality....and as that reality continue to unfold, bitcoin will continue to loose % of marketshare (when measured by market cap).
And some of these comparisons are irrelevant, in the case of wannabie spawns like bcash that created billions out of thin air by attempting to inflate bitcoin in a sneaky way, and shitcoins that have *zero* utility and are simply shit-forks who serve no purpose except to market to dumb people as a get-rich scheme.
But some like ETH, Monero...have real world utility, and therefore are viable alternatives to bitcoins, taking market share in a "fair" way. And we would be stupid to deny this fact.

I believe I already half-addressed this with my original comment -


However, injecting text messages into your transaction is a supported feature and does not require very much space. I fail to see why this would require more than 1mb, unless you were planning on injecting larger than 1 million character essay into the blockchain? At an average length of 5.1 characters per word, we could assume that that would require a approx 200k word essay, take a little bit to account for the signature data, to require a greater than 1mb transaction.
I suppose one could make the argument that blockchains can enable valid use cases of bringing the masses publications of "forbidden" text documents, kind of like how [wikileaks embedded data]( in the blockchain. 
But is this really necessary in modern society? I believe humans have always been adept at avoiding laws/regulations, and the black market has always thrived. Its probably easier to find a forbidden text at a bazaar then it is to scourage through the blockchain for juicy text.

It's normal for Casascius coins to sell at anywhere from 1.3x to 5x+ the value of BTC, depending upon the scarcity of the version. The rarest is the 500 bar with only 2 made and one is known to be open, the other still intact. There is a site that tracks the addresses associated with the coins, which were publicly posted by Mike. Second I think is the 1000 gold coin, which only....7? Were made, with Charlie Lee revealing he had a private 2FA unfunded collection made with around 20 or 30 of them, adding to the supply chain, though arguably worth significantly less than the original funded gold's with the BTC removed from the equation.
Then there's the silver 0.1 v2? ...only 48? were made. The coin that sold in the above auction, thousands were made, so very common. There's a similar version of that 2011 brass where the background text spells casascius wrong, referred to as the "error coin", which fetches a higher premium.
I was curious a while back and started researching these things. From what the whales say, the owners of the original 1000 gold's want 1000 BTC + a million USD for them. About the same for the peeled(hologram removed, bitcoins removed) 500 bar....I think that owner wants 750-1M usd for his. 
You read that right....a million bucks for a empty Bitcoin shell lol. There can currently only be one complete sealed collection and one complete (but peeled) collection....making even the empty 500 bar worth tons of BTC. I can only imagine what the intact 500 bar owner would need to sell that bad boy...I know I wouldn't take less than 10M above the BTC value if it were mine! Make those rich hungry Bitcoin millionaires twitchy.
And then there's Charlie's 1000 2FA gold's, which he was selling for 14k a piece a while back....I wonder if sold them all? That would give less rich people the opportunity to have a near-full set without needing millions.
There's a great guide on Casascius coins here -

I'm going to c/p a response I wrote that takes into account Moore's law in relation to blocksize....sorry for the long post but it's relevant.
Academic research on the topic has more than adequately demonstrated that a raising of the blocksize greater than 4MB results in massive loss of decentralization. Bear in mind SW is a 4mb max blocksize upgrade, a *compromise* that Bitcoin Core made that all the evidence points to as being the maximum "safe" blocksize under current conditions. Unless you have some new RAM cache technology up your sleeve that quadruples preformance at under current consumer prices, then this evidence will remain valid for at least the next 5 years, if not 10. Im running approx the same CPU power, RAM and HD space as I was when bitcoin was released in 2009. Moore's law has fallen off the charts (in the context of being related to increasing preformance with a drop in prices) since 2010 and has not provided the evidence that satoshi speculated would come to pass.
See the [Cornell Study]( and the [bitfury study]( on increasing the blocksize, both of which come to similar conclusions. The Cornell study suggests that we should not increase the blockchain *beyond* 4mb because it would have a substantial negative effect upon decentralization. The bitfury paper, which is older and based on a more aggressive model, suggests that 75-80% of nodes would be lost at full/constant 4mb blocksize.
The scientific method (in this context) is about demonstrating through empirical evidence an outcome with set variables (Increasing the blocksize results in "x"). Replication of findings is what solidifies the certainty of a particular model or theory. Having the bitfury paper backed by a Cornell study without any reputable counter-opposing research to me provides an extremely high degree of certainty. 
If you cannot understand that bitcoins most valuable feature is decentralization, then you really dont belong here and should forget bitcoin and continue using paypal and your bank account. Bitcoin cannot exist unless it is anti-fragile and censorship-resistant. If you do not value these things then you should use central payment systems and forget about bitcoin.
Beyond academic studies on the effect of increasing the blocksize, aka 'on-chain scaling', there are *literally the most reputable, educated and experienced scientists, polymaths and engineers* that have stated point blank that bitcoin cannot scale on-chain without sacrificing its most fundamental value, aka security. Such as [Nick Szabo](


And [Adam Back](


Those two people alone are the most experienced and educated cryptocurrency PhD's in existence. Are you really trying to tell me that the people who are responsible for the technology that created bitcoin don't understand bitcoin? That they are wrong when they tell you point blank "Bitcoin cannot scale on-chain and remain decentralized" ?
If you want bitcoin to scale on-chain then the resource usage would be so high that it could only be consolidated in extremely expensive and large data centers. If bitcoin exists in data centers, it is not censorship-resistant. If bitcoin is not censorship-resistant, then bitcoin is not bitcoin.
You have the consensus on the issue by all experts. You have academic researching backing up their claims. Seriously, what more do you need? It seems glaringly obvious to me that most people who are on the big blocker side are not educated and are immune to education. They are so entrenched in philsophical and political ideology that facts and reason cannot seep into their brains. You will either believe the evidence or you will not, but please do not try to stipulate that some of the most educated people here are wrong, or "brainwashed" when the only people who are brainwashed are those uneducated folks making the accusations. In short, stop projecting and start doing research. Real research, not "im gonna shitpost on and live in a echochamber".

The choice of currency used to peg value is irrelevant in the discussion of determining market value.
Maybe you meant to say something other than what you did, but it just sounds nonsensical to me.

Actually, you comment (even if unintentional) is actually a strawman. The scaling debate is impacted much greater by RAM, with bandwidth and storage being the least important parameters in the scaling debate.  See [here]( for a breakdown on the why.
So the image is actually quite accurate. Optimizing the efficiency of the protocol to reduce overhead in **all** technical parameters is important, which is what bitcoin core has done.
As for "not processing power", anyone well versed in the history of bitcoin and scaling would strongly disagree.
Bitcoin Core has **massively** reduced the cpu overhead required by bitcoin core over the last few major releases. If you disagree, feel free to go install a older version of bitcoin and see how long it takes to sync the network. Million bucks says its at least 3x longer than the current release.
The fact we are not talking about cpu overhead in the scaling debate is largely responsible to the amazing engineers behind the bitcoin core repo. Had they not done the work they've done over the last few years (such as the secp256k1 optimization), then perhaps we *would* actually be talking about cpu overhead.
These are "invisible" to the masses because they don't see whats under the hood, but if the bitcoin network today was powered by the code that gavin wrote, then the bitcoin network would have crashed long ago.....

This is a very good question! I see what you are doing there ;) You are trying to suppose that a LN node is a "middle man" and therefore my argument should apply?
I think, theoretically, that my same stance would apply if LN were to become a centralized model where hubs become parasitic fee takers.
I do not however think that will be the case. I think instead there will be a much higher participation rate of those looking to earn $btc by setting up a hub, which should lead to a...at the least...distributed model.
One cannot say Stripe is anything but a centralized service provider. One cannot say that about a distributed or decentralized LN where you have not *one*, but *thousands* of payment routing options, and a beautiful network topology that allows you to route in the most cost-efficient means possible.
This creates a very low barrier to entry for LN hub operators, which  should massively increase competition in the market, and retain decentralized/distributed network topology properties.

Excellent reply my dude. Thanks for helping me understand better!


So if I want to pay Alice, but I dont want to open a channel with Alice, and bob already has a channel with Alice, how would I pay alice without Bob knowing my information? Are you saying that the information would be routed to nodes around bob, and then finally to bob, without bob knowing its coming from me?
I had assumed in this scenario where we will have dedicated authoritarian/altruistic nodes bootstrapping, that the channels would be more centralized in this hypothetical until the network has time to ..hrm...spoke out? (thats how I think of it in my head) so that decentralization is higher.....anyways, that with this hypothetical scenario that payment routing would not be possible until there is more diversity within the network.

LN does not suffer from a lack of funding, it suffers from a lack of devs. There are less than 10 devs working across 4 implementations.

Its really not that difficult to understand, this is a open source codebase. There are no secrets, not hidden ultimatums. Everything is there and bare for you to digest.
The only way this conspiracy theory could hold weight is if the NSA backdoored the crypto algorithm used in bitcoin.
Except satoshi explicitly does not rely on a "magic number" type cryptographic algorithm so it is therefore immune to a faulty "random number generator" type scenario. Even if it was faulty in another area, that would have been caught by the many proficient cryptographers from the cypherpunk scene who have become involved in bitcoin.
We do not trust satoshi, *we trust math*. Satoshi probably is not even a person, its just a pseudonym of several people. A common theory is that Hal Finney was the programmer and Nick Szabo was the academic mouthpiece and author of the whitepaper.
Its a "interesting" coincidence that Hal Finney lived close to a Satoshi Nakamoto and Nick Szabo asked for help coding bitgold, which is a almost identical system to bitcoin, the year before bitcoin was released.

It was a full sentence. Why did you ignore the end? There's a enormous assumption that bitcoin cannot remain decentralized without small blocks, yet academic research has already proven we can *immediately and safely* upgrade to 4MB and we would still have 90% of our nodes capacity. And that we could move up to some ridiculous number (200mb?) and still have 50% of all our nodes operational.
I was mocking the situation because the research shows otherwise.
There are two things in the world that contrast with each other:
Opinions and data.

You apparently still don't get it. Bitcoin is never "dropped as a medium of payment" *because its impossible to censor bitcoin transactions*.
If you mean dropped as a payment option by the legacy financial system, then so what? Bitcoin was designed to function with **zero** support from that system.
People should not be using middle men to process bitcoin transactions, it entirely defeats the purpose of bitcoin. If your business doesn't accept bitcoin and you want to buy something, then you either need to use your voice and tell them to accept bitcoin payments directly, or you can use the exit strategy and buy from someone else.
You keep on trying to pander to the old system without realizing it.

This is something I've thought about as well. However, it is open source and bcash has retained enough market value to attract developer interest. It would be a large project to recombine SW into bcash's codebase, but not impossible, simply work.
And implementing bcash to LN is something that would be done by LN proponents, not bcash (I think?). So as long as bcash implements SW, they can have LN.
So im not so sold that they will never implement SW. As you can see, btc.com just implemented SW. Coinbase is going to implement SW. So why not bcash? When they realize they will be left behind the curve, they will adopt it.
Just like every other change that they fight against.

When I was writing the message, I knew that some uneducated troll would respond to my comment fud'ing about fees.
What do transfer fee's have to do with what I was talking about? In fact, the higher the fee, even *more so* the reason to avoid losing less btc in the transaction, encouraging peer to peer transactions even more so.
But to address your question directly -
I don't. Fee's in bitcoin exist, and they serve a valid function. Are they too high right now? No, actually they are not. [Did you know that **today** has over 40,000 transactions confirmed in the 1-10 sat/byte range?](
Kind of ridiculous to take that stance with the current conditions, however I acknowledge that we have a mining oscillation problem due to the bcash scammers cloning bitcoin, using the same mining algorithm (with some fucked up adjustment algorithms) and then *defrauding* investors by claiming "its the real bitcoin".
But hey, its a free market and thats how life goes. Which btw is why we have high fees in bitcoin. If people did not want to use bitcoin so badly, they would not pay the fee's. "Its too busy here, im going somewhere else" is the argument you are using, which is to say "bitcoin is too popular"
Not a very effective argument.

Nice cherry picking. I can do the same thing? Look, on [december 9th btc had 65% of marketshare measured by marketcap]( ...zoom to 3m to see the peak for that day.
So one could just as easily argue that in 3 weeks, bitcoin has "lost nearly half of its market share dominance and is clearly on the path to being dead"....
Except, when you cherry pick a metric to make a point you are not being a honest participant within a debate.
Yes, bitcoin just had a rally and yes, bitcoin just had a correction. And as we are watching literally this moment, bitcoin went from 13,700 to 15,500 in 1.5 hrs.
Thats a increase of $30,200,691,600 in less than 2 hours. Dude....30 billion in less than 2 hours? Thats fucking insane.
But that should demonstrate how wild these markets are, and how irrelevant it is to use this metric as your measuring stick. Forget the fact that 99% of these altcoins have artificial marketcaps that do not reflect real world value. Forget that some of these alts are premines, and supply side economics are artifically controlled by central entities....
Just focus on the fact that bitcoin just appreciated in value to the tune of 30 billion dollars in 90 minutes.
That should demonstrate just how absurd it is to use these market caps as a measuring stick. Yes, bitcoin is down to a record low of 36%. 
Because you have the inverse happening. Instead of bitcoin rallying, you have 2 of its competitors rallying to big news while bitcoin was facing a correction to its bull run. ETH is rallying on the Russian rumors, and Ripple/bcash is rallying on the coinbase intergration rumors/news.
But these assets will correct. Just like bitcoin corrected. And at this very moment what does coinmarketcap look like? [I see a LOT of red going on there, and I see bitcoin regaining tons of ground](
So yes, of course you can make headlines writing doom and gloom by cherry picking a opportune moment to create a narrative.
But as usual that narrative is short term and short sighted. Yes, of course alt-coins will continue to thrive. The world is filled with hopeless stupid people who missed the bitcoin bandwagon and all way to get-rich-quick by buying shitcoins. Except they don't realize they are buying shitcoins. 
Those who bought ETH in its infancy are reaping the rewards. But who knows what the next ETH will be? Is it IOTA? Is it Cardano? Who knows. But I know this, only a few will thrive, and the rest will starve. And that means that the **majority** of investors will have lost  or wasted their money speculating on losers.

This vulnerability is especially important to virtualization because virtual operating systems will be shared across a single host. This this means any customer who purchases a VPS service will be able to install specially crafted software with regular user permissions and that software will exploit these flaws to allow them to read the memory contents of the entire computer exposing all normally secured information in plain text. 
That means all passwords. Which makes it trivial to attack.
But this is also incredibly concerning for all cryptocurrency users in general because it means that their passwords to wallets can be easily exposed. I'm sure there will be malware created that will install and be just waiting to be exploited the moment that you enter in the password to your wallet, ready to steal all your BTC.

I'm not  sure that's the case with a "live" distribution. If it's not internet connected....sure, but most people use these live OS systems to connect to the internet. The OS is encrypted but when you boot it, it's decrypted. When a attacker interfaces with rpc on a encrypted system is no different than a regular OS.
I don't run tails, but I would imagine the electrum install is the same on it as any other Linux system, which is to say if you didn't set a pass you are definitely vulnerable to this exploit.
If I recall correctly, doesn't tails use some sort of browser sandboxing? And don't these live OS browsers limit JavaScript usage? I would think it is those two features that would protect your wallet more than any others, but I don't know enough about the OS to be sure.
I don't think you should spread this opinion of yours until the electrum devs assure the public that particular OS is unaffected. It might lead people to believe they are secure when they are not.

Dude, this is a global decentralized open source project that requires *consensus* to change. You cannot achieve consensus without debating a topic.
We rolled out a upgrade to optimize blockspace over 2 years ago, only to watch centralized entities fight it tooth and nail against it once they realized it would negatively impact their monopolies (bitmain). The propaganda started about 1.5 years ago that turned a technical discussion into a political one.
More importantly, this upgrade is required in order to further upgrade the system again (MAST, schnorr, LN)that will truly scale Bitcoin so that it can be used in daily commerce microtransactions and other neat new use cases that wouldn't have been possible if not for SW.
There has been action on this topic for years now, and it's quite clear ALL experts on Bitcoin reached consensus on the path forward while a few poisonous actors wanted to poison the well for personal gains.
If everyone adopted SW today the mempool would clear and fees would be back in the 1-10 sat/byte range.
"Fixing" the fees is as simple as adopting the upgrade. So you want to do that? Encourage others to do so.....no arguing.

Great post and I'm glad I'm not the only one telling people that a hub a spoke LN is, at worst case, still a massive beneficial improvement to the network. 
What I am concerned about is hot wallet and node security. If regular consumers with no security background are running hot wallet nodes with consumer hardware and out-of-date software we will end up seeing a lot of BTC stolen.
Maybe larger outfits with hardened security will be essential to the long term health of LN liquidity.

Thats a very interesting incentive idea.


I remember telling 100's of ignorant shitposters that using bandwidth in the scaling debate is a strawman, so im not so concerned with people not knowing whats up.


Yes, but more transmission overhead on a layer 2 peer-to-peer network is much of less a concern. It does not have the rigid security properties that bitcoin has, and I think we will see much higher participation rates on LN nodes than we will on btc non-mining "full" nodes due to the fact that there is actually an economic incentive structure built in.
This should lead to a higher participation rate, which would allow us to be more loose and fast with overhead. Also, bandwidth is very cheap and we wont suffer any of the latency issues that stem from mining...so once we take the non-issues out of the discussion theres much less reason to hate the overhead.
Though admittedly I dont yet fully grasp the peering, routing or general bandwidth overhead, so I am speculating with a limited current understanding of bandwidth needs. Perhaps its much more bandwidth intensive than I am currently thinking.

BCH is an attack on bitcoin. By using the same mining algorithm and consensus breaking rules its a power grab to steal marketshare from bitcoins ecosystem.
The proponents of BCH (Roger Ver owner of bitcoin.com ...oh the irony)have perpetuated the myth that it is the "real bitcoin" despite the fact that this is blatantly false by every empirical measurement.
If you purchased apple stock, and then apples competitor cloned all the apples products, called it "Apple Plus", claimed it was "the real apple" and stole a % of marketshare devaluing your apple shares, then you would be pissed.
BCH is doing exactly this. This is merely an alternative form of inflation. Since they failed to reach consensus to change the rules instead they go the shady route, lie to your face and create more tokens claiming its "the real bitcoin". So they created another 21 million coins out of thin air, and convinced enough uneducated people that it has value.
This should never be applauded and these attacks are insidious forms of inflation that also has a brand damaging effect.

Your making assumptions. People don't just buy bitcoin as a store of value. Plenty of people use bitcoin as a currency otherwise we wouldn't have the mempool issues we have today.
The point is not about comparing the two's practical applications. The point was to demonstrate that when given a choice to hold or not, people choose to spend.
This is *exactly* the scenario bitcoin operates in. You can choose to hold it, to gain more value, or you can choose to spend it on things you need/want.
Just like you can hold your USD and wait to gain more value for your PC purchase, or you can spend it on the computer things you need/want.

You cannot expect people to get your point if your incapable of basic grammar. You did not pose a question, you made a statement in your post.


If this was intended to be your "question" then maybe you should have used this question as the title of your post instead of the inaccurate statement you made on your post.
To answer your question posited *here* (not in your post btw), the answer is relatively simple -
Exchanges/wallet service providers who have not adopted segwit and are still forcing default high value fee's are responsible for skewing the fee estimation algorithm upwards which has a circular effect, reinforcing higher fee's.
So if you look at [21 co's fee site]( right now you'll see that there are 42 *thousand* transactions confirmed *today* with a 1-10 sat/byte fee (2nd largest bracket). Those are the intelligent bitcoiners who are using bitcoin software that allows them to set a fee easily/manually and are doing bitcoin right.
Now if you look at the 390-400 satoshi bracket, thats currently the largest bracket of txs confirmed. 
This is due to aforementioned exchanges that are hardcoding default fee's. Fuck these people. They are the same ones that wanted to increase the blocksize so that they wouldn't have to adopt new changes that improve the network and protocol. These are the same assholes who cry about "high fee's" *while charging ridiculously high fee's*. 
They are the cause of the problem. The issue is there are more people transacting through these service providers than there are people not transacting through these service providers. If 30-40k of those currently using shit-sites like coinbase and shapeshift as a bitcoin wallet that default to high fee's, then there would be more people in the right bracket and the estimation fee algorithm would start dropping in its recommendations.
That however would not fix the fact that these shit-sites are still hardcoding a default ridiculsouly-way-too-high fee, so until these assholes get with the times and actually fix their shit they will continue to fuck the fee estimation algorithm.

I'm not convinced that's the case. Over the years I've watched people flock from one shitcoin to the next and I've come to realize that the value of an asset can be continuously pulled up by more fools entering The Fray and buying that asset.
I think that this will continue its cycle for Years yet so most people to buy Ripple now will probably watch it increase in value over the next two years until it becomes apparent that it has no real world utilization. 
Whether or not it has real-world utilization depends upon adoption and ripple for what it is is a efficient system so it's quite possible that they will convince Banks and other Central entities to use their IOU payment Network for a loose frictional environment than Bitcoin with more central control.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:49:42


Why destroy when they can get rich with us? That really is the fundamental design of Bitcoin in that it is much more expensive to attack the network than it is simply to buy the asset.
They already have been "attacking" us but it's in a form of market share dominance. I think the first large-scale blockchain coup attempt was the banking consortium's R3. It appears that the project has mostly died.
But we still have companies like coinbase who have become the de facto Bitcoin Bank. What's the point of having a trustless Global decentralized Currency if you rely on a middleman to hold your keys?
That's the beauty and stupidity of all of this from the perspective of coinbase and that they know that they can capitalize upon the stupid to store their Bitcoin on their platform which will eventually be used for fractional Reserve lending and other banking purposes.
Excessive KYC and AML compliance, combined with far over reaching IRS implications allows the states to get their hands into Bitcoin in a way that Bitcoin was designed to evade. 
They will attack us by joining us and attempting to dominate the market. That's why Bitcoin is such a trojan horse because no matter how many fools coinbase hooks into keeping their crypto on their site it is going to bring education and awareness to the rest of the population that they don't have to keep their Bitcoin on their site. The macro effect of these companies engaging in Fiat Bridge business models is that it enables flexibility within the ecosystem for people to easily purchase which will bootstrap Bitcoin as a currency and a system far far beyond any damage that the banking system could impose upon Bitcoin through market dominance.

Brave launched with Bitcoin features in 2016. However this year they switch to BAT. I believe most of the reasoning was transactional cost and an inability to acquire large sums of Bitcoin to give out to users to jump start the feature and Network.

You are making assumptions in a vacuum and that's not how real life works. You cannot change variables and then expect nothing will follow. "Build it and they will come" is the analogy for this circumstance.
There is too much Bitcoin competition and for you to make these assumptions shows a naivety and a lack of depth in the transactional history of Bitcoin. Your logic is basically that because transaction count follows a linear scale that we could just change the block size to meet the linear scaling demand of transactional count.
Yet you were ignoring all of the massive spikes in transaction count throughout the last few years of spam attacks on bitcoin. These scenarios will not disappear when Bitcoin upgrades its block size. All that will happen is Bitcoin will have a temporary reduction and fees which will then be quickly filled in because anyone can generate any amount of large transactional data and broadcast it filling up the blockchain and getting it to near full that way fees are increased again.
You really need to understand this point to understand why you are wrong. If it becomes cheap to transact on bitcoin again then transact people will do both in a normal fashion and with a ulterior purpose to clog up the blockchain to increase fees so that other competitors are cheaper to use.
The spam attacks on bitcoin is no different than the ddosing of competitors websites or marketplaces. They will continue to happen and they will continue to evolve regardless of what variable is created.
It doesn't matter whether Bitcoin has 2mb 8mb 16mb 32mb or 64mb.... So long as shitty people behind shitty fucking Wanna Be clones exist then they will clog up the blockchain so that their shitcoin is cheaper and faster.
Why? Because it makes economical sense to do so. It's cheap to attack the Bitcoin blockchain and hold your alt as your propaganda sock puppets flood social media crying about Satoshi's vision.
People are fools and they gobble the stupid shit up, because they missed the train and desperately want to be on the 2nd train. The masses know now and will be taken advantage of.

Is everyone here really bothered about the fact that the IRS already asked you if you have foreign bank accounts?
I think it's pretty standard practice for your government to want to know your assets so that they can tax you.
Bitcoin is an asset and I don't really see the difference between asking if you have a foreign bank account and asking if you have Bitcoin. Has Obama famously said Bitcoin is like a miniature digital Swiss bank account in your pocket.
If it bothers you that the IRS asks about foreign bank accounts when you do your taxes then it would not be hypocritical for you to be bothered by this change of terminology in this bill. 
I think it's an important time to remind everyone that Bitcoin was not created for tax evasion. There is not a single reference in the white paper or any Bitcointalk posts by Satoshi that talks about evading taxes.
The only real ideological purpose that we know for Bitcoin is to eliminate Central entities from controlling monetary policy. That's it. Nothing else has ever been said on the topic by Satoshi or the white paper or any of his writings.

I felt that this was the more important part of this speech as it relates to Bitcoin and our community.
Whether you have nuanced feelings about market impacts due to institutionalization via ETF, or you have an ideological perspective against it, most of us recognize regardless of our feelings that having public regulated investment vehicles will only create more market activity that will lead to an increase of price in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
Another important aspect to remember is that the Winklevoss rejection was decided by only three chairman. That means that she only has to convince one other peer to switch sides before one of these ETFs are approved.
NYSEs bakkt Market will likely resolve a lot of fears that these various chairman have over the underlying Market being unregulated. I think that 2019 is going to be the flipping point for these chairman which will lead to an approval of several ETFs.

What happens when the bank transfer is from a defrauded account and you get a wire reversal 3 weeks later?
How is escrow going to help when you've already released it? Literally the only time I have ever advised someone to sell on one of these alternative exchanges that's what happened. From an account with tons of feedback, provided all docs, selfie, etc.
This aspect *cannot be solved* with decentralized solutions. This is something only solved with centralized systems with aml/kyc, insurance, etc. The only way a DAX can overcome this is by forcing every customer to deposit *more* than the transaction to hold as collateral for *months*. Who would trade with those requirements? DAX needs market makers willing to absorb huge risks.

Fiat will eventually be gone from Society, maybe even before we die, but it will in all probability be replaced by current incumbents digital systems.

Nice false narrative.


I see you've been drinking the koolaid. Either you are really new to bitcoin or you just have not grasped the complexity of the system yet. Either way its ok, but you really shouldn't go around making untrue claims.
The WP states -


events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. 
As per the WP, bitcoin is the longest chain with *the largest pool of cpu power* enforcing consensus rules...which is currently bitcoin core by every single metric you can measure.
Now, the last part is tricky, because [satoshi stated that you can have a *longer* PoW and still have an **invalid chain**.](
So you must have the longest proof of work, the largest pool of cpu power *and* enforcing consensus. Where we would get into tricky business is if a non-consensus-compatible fork managed to obtain both the largest pool of cpu power (and therefore logically would follow) the longest chain. Because then we would have a chain that per WP would rationally argued as "bitcoin" yet per satoshi via his own release notes would also throw into question whether or not that chain could be considered bitcoin because of its non-compatible consensus rule changes.
We almost saw this happen with S2X. But...we didn't. So its incredibly naive to try to claim there isn't a real bitcoin. Thats something that only disillusioned bcash supporters who have fallen into Roger's inaccurate narrative would say.

**No**, they fucking cannot. Because instead of having a homologous ecosystem where everyone is cool we have a real society with diverse actors all attempting to better themselves. Well the cats out of the bag and there's money to be made shitting on Bitcoin and forking it trying to take as much market share as possible.
Instead of pooled resources increasing the efficiency of Bitcoin we have intermarket forces competing for the same land. Except it's a tragedy of the commons because those who shortcut long term security will have a short term advantage subsidizing costs to node operators to bootstrap their shitcoin.

This post was one giant false dichotomy. It has completely ignored all of the Dynamics of the problem and urges for a Kick the Can down the road solution.
How many times do we have to have this discussion? A small block size increase will not resolve the problem. However much space we increase the block size it will near immediately be filled by demand. You will end up in the same exact position as you were 3 months or 6 months ago except now we have a compounding resource usage affect that will affect Bitcoin security. Then at that point what did you gain? Well for a short period of time you subsidized the cost of transactions to the altruistic node operators of the network. How the hell is that a good thing? Seems to me it's a naive short-sighted complaint that comes across as whiny because you have to pay more for your Starbucks. But even worse is that it's not just a short time Compound Effect it's a long-term Compound Effect where you had a short period in which it might have been cheaper for some people to use the network but now you have a forever period where the additional resource usage is forever compounded. You really have to think about cause and effect here.
This does not even begin to touch the fact that actually hard forking Bitcoin for such a non-technical reason is a lost cause which has been proven extensively with a failed segwit2x hard Fork.
Yes it is correct the lightning network has been in the works for years. Yes this is what happens when you decide to engineer an enormous project. It's not a small solution it's a very Advanced solution that takes over a million lines of code.
I find this post incredibly frustrating considering we are literally on the verge of launching lightning Network. All this post does is incite emotions and inflamed non-technical discussion about things that have already been discussed to death ad nauseum.
I think that bitcoiners need to accept that centralized systems are always going to be more efficient than decentralized systems. Bitcoin will have its purpose and Fiat will have its purpose. All of this Bitcoin is going to take down The banking system is just over exuberant fantasy thinking. Yes until the lightning that work matures it's absolutely always going to be more cheap and efficient to use Visa over Bitcoin.
With extensive adoption and time that may change and it may never not.
Also the absurdity of this post is breathtaking when you consider the fact that the largest contributors to block space resource usage which is primarily exchanges are the same ones that have not implemented segwit which reduces block space usage and therefore reduce fees.
Instead of asking for the impossible why don't you instead Lobby all of these exchanges to implement segwit so we can get reduce block size so that fee drop down?
To those of us in the know your post comes across as uneducated and fighting for exactly the wrong thing. The analog I would give here would be that instead of writing letters to your Senator and protesting at their office you're sitting there screaming at the TV asking why the laws changed. It's ineffectual and pointless.

Bad title. Should have been "US loses extradition battle with Russia over BTC-E operator". This is not &gt;The US requested Vinnik's extradition on a case involving 21 charges related to money laundering and the operation of an unlicensed money exchange. Vinnik faced a combined maximum sentence of up to 35 years in prison, along with various fines, in the US case alone.


This sounds like a Russian Government conspiracy. I always wondered if the Russian Oligarchs had their hands into this exchange as a way to launder a few extra billion in illict proceeds. The fate of this person will ultimately determine involvement. If he gets a slap on the wrist, then its pretty obvious he was one of putin's underlings.

You seem to be randomly picking facts to use as a narrative for your reasoning, but even the random facts you pick dont support your conclusions.
The dollar is not going anywhere anytime soon.
I personally think by the end of my lifetime we *might* see a shift in dominance from USD to the Yuan, but I accept that it might not happen due to vastly complex geopolitical and macro economic circumstances.
If America is good at one thing, its killing people it disagrees with. This alone is why USD will retain its power for many, *many* generations to come. Im pretty confident most people here don't agree with the morality of that scenario, but they at least acknowledge its true.

The Bitcoin community has been divided ever since Gavin and Mike Hearn decided to launch Bitcoin XT. The bcash split was merely the eventuality that came to from Gavin's betrayal to the community.
This individual is not dividing anything it has long since been divided and only someone who has not participated here all this time could fail to see that.

This is a false pretense that has been proven wrong. See covert ASIC-Boost and bitmain for prime examples. More examples are selfish mining/ empty blocks, exploiting the bug this post is about and altcoin sha256 competition (remember bad bcash EDA?)

This has been a long concern of mine. We cannot ignore that this is true to an extent. The Bitcoin ecosystem is heavily influenced by it's participants, making it partially a social network of value. The code that we run depends upon social consensus. We all convince our peers to run this version or that, because reasons. Bitcoin is vulnerable to social influence and that has always scared me.
I know how stupid humans can be. A lot of stupid humans can be a very powerful force, which is why there is 100's of billions of "value" in complete shitcoins.
They are right to an extent, but centralization is a concern. The point of Bitcoin is to make it invulnerable to attack and it seems ETH has less concern about this.
Which is why I think ETH will be the corporate coin and BTC the piece of gold. Both will have value but for different reasons.
I always encourage friends to buy both. ETH is the best hedge against Bitcoin.

I agree and it's important to specify that those who buy without extensive research are gambling vs though who do are investing.
Knowledge is a main contributor to defining the difference.

Encouraging people to stop treating mature cryptocurrencies like crazy hyper speculative assets that gain 1000x, and instead to focus on developing real world case uses could only be a benefit to the economy.
I don't think it will have *any effect whatsoever* because if there's one lesson I've learned from crypto it's that humans will recklessly repeat the same mistakes over and over.
Still, it's good to see a "leader" focus on the right things. Most Bitcoin developers have or would say the same thing, so I don't see the controversy here?
All I see is a redditor who either wants to stir the pot or is so shallow and naive that he thinks Bitcoin will see 1000x gains.

True and false. The fact you cannot even ask a simple question without making a contradiction demonstrates your inability to discuss complex topics. They both cannot be fired (except by themselves) and absolutely *are* both replaceable and disposable.


Why are you using the term "hard" ? You have a problem with skewing the discussion by adding in terms that don't have common definitions. This is **not** how you engage in debate. All it does is demonstrate that you are **not** a honest actor in this disucssion.


Except for the fact (which you keep ignoring/denying) that they **did** in fact specifically **not** signal for segwit, and instead signaled for segwit2x.
Yet in the end, what did they do? They signaled for segwit and saw the upgrade pushed through, despite *literal years* of lobbying against it, both via signaling and via social media.
This demonstrates that despite your assumptions, these supposed majority power miners did not have the power to block the change. You keep asserting they have veto power, yet the only time they could have effectively veto'd a change they **didn't**. Why do you keep ignoring this **fact** ? 
And don't try to tell me its not a fact because the history is 100% transparent and public. We are running segwit now. We have documented historical facts relating to miners support of segwit, and segwit2x. If you keep asserting this is not true you are only being made out to be an obvious liar. I fucking hate liars.

I want to see pump-and-dump + ponzi schemes gone after with the full weight of the justice system. 
I want to see individuals businesses or organizations that publish false information that leads to Market activity to be punished for falsifying investor information.
those were just a few ideas off the top of my head but I'm sure that if I sat down and spent some time I can put together some common-sense regulatory laws that seek only to protect investors but still allow for complete open innovation. 
a lot of people here don't want to accept the concept of societal collateral damage. The truth is is that most people are simply under-educated and will be taken advantage of. Economic Darwinism is horrible for society. it leads to widening inequality and consolidated power structures that widen this inequality gap further and further by leveraging their strengthened capital advantage to further consolidate power and weekend regulatory infrastructure that is meant to protect.
I'll be the first one to admit that there is a shitload of bad regulation in society. But you don't throw the baby out with the bathwater, instead you take the baby out you clean the fucking bathtub and then you put the baby back in for the next bath.

Good article from the perspective of an institutional participant. A eye opening article for the typical anarcho-capitalist or libertarian leaning bitcoiner, see -


I'm pro-regulation. The reason I am is because I see no point in fighting the inevitable. I see a lot of pros and cons both ways, and my greatest fear of collateral damage due to artificial inflation still stands, yet I cannot deny that such new market infrastructure will likely lead to some serious bull runs in the next few years. I also worry that Bitcoin markets might start to follow regulated marketplaces price discovery if they become larger players in terms of value traded. 
For those who hate this, just try to focus on the fact that regulators will regulate, but Bitcoin cannot be regulated. The system will continue to function outside this little regulatory bubble, and nothing they can do will stop it.
Bitcoin always has been, and will continue to be a Trojan horse.

Bitcoin is a peer to peer system. The "best" way to use a peer to peer system *is with your peers*.
My suggestion for a "fiat ramp" is to deal with local traders in face to face transactions.
I get it, people want fast easy and cheap. Those are qualities you trade your personal security and liberty for in using centralized systems.
The entire point of bitcoin is to change this dynamic, to remove the power from centralized servicers and to grant power to the individual. At the end of the day, no one can empower you to empower yourself other than *you*.

Apparently you are not aware of the carcinogenic products that are used to avoid diseases and bugs in marijuana. Similarly there are all kinds of nasty pesticides that are neurotoxic that are regularly used on produce.
There was research published just a few weeks ago that showed most commercial cereals having glyphosate in elevated levels well above the standard set by the FDA. Are you going to tell me that if we remove this regulation that it will get better and not worse? If so it's difficult to deal with people who do not use common sense. 
We have very strong philosophical differences on this and I'm not going to convince you and you certainly aren't going to convince me. You apparently think if we remove regulations that somehow Society will self-regulate. That is Whimsical naivety that is not founded in any basis of Truth.
Profits will always outweigh public Health. If you do not regulate then the public will suffer. Again I'm not saying all regulation is good there's plenty of bad regulation but throwing the baby out with the bathwater is just plain ignorance.
You want proof regulation is good? Reach Capitalism by Thomas Piketty. He proves with empirical evidence. Regulation crafted to serve the public increases the well-being of society by examining socioeconomic data from the last 500 years.
random posters on Reddit is not going to convince you of anything. Actually read some research on the subject and maybe you'll learn something.

3.78 million BTC is 18% of 21m. Projected bottom electric cost is 2k per BTC for geothermal/hydro electric. 
That's 7.56 billion in electric cost alone, leaving approx 13-14 billion on the table to be earned minus Hardware costs.
it's very difficult to extrapolate how much Hardware will cost because it's on a curve both in demand, Supply + costs and I am not a statistics major.
But one can easily imagine that if a company like bitmain is making a couple billion dollars a year in profit then they are probably selling at least 4+ billion retail value. which should go down drastically considering there is more competition in the market and their prices have dropped by 1/3.

Also, you cannot back a USD per with BTC. Not rationally at least. Advising to back a stable asset with a volitile one is pretty dumb. You would need 100x BTC value deposited for each dollar to satisfy regulators.

You seem to be new here, so maybe contradicting people who have been large contributors and have *proven themselves* to be knowledgeable is a bad idea? Especially by making statements that demonstrate your ignorance.
It's almost like you are *trying* to get downvoted.
The correct answer is that *consensus*, which is determined by the economy at large, is what defines Bitcoin. It's not a simple answer however, and there are multiple dimensions to understanding how consensus works. It is a complex social construct with underlying influencers, predominantly economic but, as we have seen with soft fork drama, also politically and socially (reputation based) motivated as well. Unfortunately identity politics have entered the arena, as we saw with the Roger ver crew. Bitcoin is not a top down system. It is very much a bottom up system where the individual choices of it's users has a majority impact on how the system works, or is defined.
If you think there are simple answers to complex problems, then you don't have the capacity for comprehending

I don't think bitcoin is useful as a replacement for "real" currency.

Bitcoin and Fiat will co-exist. Nothing is replacing anything.

This is semantics. You call it "politics" but I do not see it that way. 


You are telling me that scenario is "politics" ? Because that doesn't seem like politics to me. That seems like shady business practices.
I think you are confusing terminology here and then trying to argue from a false perspective.


Dont be stupid. Bill gates did not copy apples source code and then claim it was "the real apple". Bill gates built his own computer with his own design and created his own company.
The closest way for your analogy to make sense is to compare bitcoin to a alt-coin that did not use ** a single line** of bitcoins source code. 
And you know what? Thats cool. I have no hate for altcoins in general, I see tons of innovative stuff and im happy for it.
Cloning someones source code, then claiming you are the person you cloned the code from is not "politics" thats called "being a fucking shithead".


You are a waste of time. I quoted you from your own post and I answered **your own** question. Don't get salty when you ask a question and someone answers it, thats called acting like a pissy little girl.


^^ your question.


Yes. Bcash's technical merits are complete shit. They are subsidizing their blockchain costs onto node operators without consideration for long term security. This behavior will inevitably lead towards centralization since multiple TB blockchains cannot be reasonably sustained by *cheap consumer hardware*. Stop thinking about rich americans and start thinking about the rest of the world, which is what bitcoin was made for. If people in Africa and Venezuela cannot  run nodes then that blockchain cannot stay decentralized. Considering Bcash's node count is *more than half* located on VPS nodes, its  *already* too centralized. This ignores decentralization which is the fundamental value proposition of decentralized cryptocurrencies. Also, most of the miners mining it (Bitmain/Viabtc &amp; subsidaries) control **way more** than 51% of hashpower when you consider that these subsidaries are all controlled by a **single individual**. How secure is a blockchain who has more than 51% of its hashpower controlled by one wealthy chinese dude who's already shown capable of fucking over the network to make a few extra bucks?
It also implemented a shit algorithm that caused mayhem on the entire network, fucking over bitcoin and bcash at the same time, leading to oscillating hashpower.
Not only that, but they have a [developer centralization problem]( where a single developer ignores everyone else and implements shitty algorithms without reasonable peer review.
This is validated above by developers bitching about the lack of open review and fairness.
Its a centralized shitcoin with a centralized dev and centralized infrastructure.
Whats the technical merits to a centralized shitcoin pretending to be a decentralized cryptocoin?
What would bcash be without the name bitcoin? Oh yea, another bloated piece of shit altcoin with *zero purpose*.
The ***real question**, the one that **you should be asking yourself** is "What innovation does bitcoin cash bring that other cryptocurrencies have not"?
You are asking the wrong questions kid. Get your priorities straight and ask the right questions.

Context matters. If its a majority fork then the community has reached social consensus on what fork is bitcoin.
That means a minority fork **is not** bitcoin. So I would of course route for the network that has reached consensus.


Maybe, but context matters. Depends on what they change. If its truly a team aspiring towards innovation on the protocol that comes up with interesting new ideas, sure, why not? I wouldn't hate on it.
The problem is every single one of these forks is political. It has literally nothing to do with technical parameters and everything to do with peoples ideologically driven agendas.
That makes all of these forks political forks, which I see as socially constructed attacks upon the network.

I don't disagree but regulated companies working in the public will be criminally charged (aka slap on the wrist fine) for brokering unregulated securities if they try to sell a ICO without asking the SEC for permission first.
While I would normally be against such authoritarianism, I also recognize what the "free market" does to the average unsophisticated investor - recks them, because the average person is lazy and stupid and unwilling to properly research complex topics before buying. This industry is filled with scammers trying to rip people off with shitcoins.
I'm not sure the SEC is the best choice, but I actually do feel there should be some reputation based system as it relates to authority/cental agency/regulation because the "free market" will only see the average investor get robbed and scammers get rich.
This is in reference to ICOs btw, not general cryptocurrencies.

1 take away I'm having while watching this is the fascinating aspect of Satoshi specifically using Perry's mailing list as opposed to the old original cypherpunks mailing list. The aspect of it that is fascinating is the fact that Perry thought there was too much noise going on on the cypherpunks so he started a *moderated* mailing list where everything had to be pre-approved by Central authority.
Yes that's right Roger Satoshi himself specifically opted to release the Bitcoin whitepaper on a censored mailing list.

These organizations then avoid the responsibilities to society by hiding profits offshore, or utilize accounting tricks that are technically legal but deprived Society of Revenue for Building Bridges paying teachers, etc. Meanwhile the printing press runs on unlimited power for war budgets.

It clearly says [1,129,118,000 IRR]( which according to google is 26k USD per btc.


I think the better way to say it would be to articulate that the IRR to USD exchange rate carries a massive premium due to the economic scenario that plays out between the west and Iran.
I would be more interested to know how IRR converts into other currencies, and a quick glance shows 23k Euro's, 184,204.06 Yuan ...both of which convert into approx 26k USD.
So it does indeed appear that there is a extreme premium on btc in various currencies in Iran. Its not just a blockade on USD that has caused this.

You have been bamboozled by retards. We have had fair handed moderation for at least **3 years** on All this drama stems from 3.5-4 years ago before the community existed, when there was a lot of big block drama when gavin was advocating for hard forking bitcoin to increase the block size.
So theymos banned "altcoin talk", which was *definitely a mistake* because it caused a streisand effect, leading to the creation of and the split in the community.
Ever since then, the crowd has been whinging about "censorship!!!11!1!". Yes, approx 4 years ago they had a valid point. Theymos fucked up, and I have been around since then and have always been highly critical of theymos for his actions.
*Yet*, since then, there has been incredibly light handed moderation in relationship towards censorship of discussion of alt-coins and bitcoin competitors.
The only reason you will get *moderated* is because most of these fools just want to cause a ton of shit, stir the pot, and create noise. Moderation is **not** censorship. What you are seeing is an essential part of keeping this subreddit clean from shit, and we want it to continue. 
None of us want that noise in this forum. IF you want to go back to the conspiracy theory den that has always been, and continues to be, you are welcome to it.
But do not try to bring their cesspool of ignorance and noise here. We are not interested and have been very happy with the way moderation has been handled the last 3 years.
I don't always agree with the mods here, but they do a *damn good job* 99.9% of the time. So kudos to and for backing off his rigid stance and keeping shit together moving forward.
Also, I would just like to say - There in all probability cannot exist "censorship" on a private businesses forum. Censorship is the action of a authority/government. Moderation is the act of a private organization in keeping the gutters clean. Reddit is part of a social media free market. You are always welcome to express your ideas on another subreddit, you can start your own even! Or you can use any other of the hundreds of social media sites to express your opinion, you can write to your senators, etc. So im not sure its even rational to argue censorship is possible on reddit. *Heavy* moderation, sure! But censorship? Your rights are not being invalidated when you open your mouth and say some stupid shit that causes a ruckus and you get moderated.

You're totally going on a tangent. I've not missed that point at all and I fully understand that the cabinet a president elects, such as his directors, have direct influence over who they wish to pursue and prosecute.
But you are mistaken if you think that the judges sit in the pockets of the executive branch. Regardless of what the executive branch chooses to prosecute, the judicial branch has not just the moral imperative to judge within the constructs of the laws original intent, but a *duty* to make sure that it is upheld and not perverted.
I think it is *you* who is missing that specific point in your compass of comprehension.
I said what I already said in my previous post about my feelings about leverage, corruption, etc. I still think that the judicial branch is effective at stemming the flow of watering down core values based in law.

Bad ones, apparently.
I dont recall Obama sitting in the judges panel on this seat, nor have I ever heard of the president taking a direct role in Judicial proceedings, which would be a violation of the decentralized governance standards in which our constitutional republic was created.

None of these things compromise the security model of bitcoin. You clearly don't understand bitcoin because its *exactly the opposite*. Segwit vastly improves the security of bitcoin disallowing malleability.
RBF is a security-neutral feature. 0-conf transactions were *never* secure. Funny though, because SW actually makes them the most secure they will ever be....yet you still think the exact opposite of reality.
Full blocks increases the bid price of transaction fee's, increasing the profitability of mining and therefore increasing the security of the network.
You may have ignorant trolls vote brigading from but those of us who *actually understand* bitcoin are not fooled by such ignorance.


There is no current economic incentive for nodes to exist. This is a problem in bitcoin that is solved with LN. Im sure you hate that too though....


You clearly dont understand how LN works if thats your opinion. Unsurprising.


Funny, because all of the "weall reasoned information" coming from the most intelligent and experienced engineers in the space says *the exact opposite* of what you've described here.

I read this book many years ago and it has impacted my life greatly. Its the truth, whole and raw and unadulterated, and it proves to you that our system is a giant fraud scheme.
The video is about the government being involved in a many year scheme to put his wife in jail to punish him for releasing the truth in the book. I say the truth, because the IRS has acknowledged the truth in the book because every single return filed with the knowledge gained in this book that the IRS accepts is proof that the reasoning in the book is both valid and legal.

The argument is that is not an effective means of determining econmic activity. You can consolidate 20 addresses into a single address with one tx, but that doesn't mean you preformed 20 actions. This is the beauty of the system...it's efficient and will be much more so with schnoor.
The honest truth is just that both these metrics, txs vs inputs/ouputs are apples to oranges and comparing them doesn't add significant clarity to the conversation.
It's a nuanced conversation that requires understanding of how the system works.
Txs *may* go down but as long as outputs go up the system is working as intended and appears healthy

I do not believe that localbitcoins is precisely decentralized as they are still a centralized service,
Escrow is still handled by a centralized service which is the most important aspect. Risk is still large when a centralized service is taking custodial access over your funds.
The model itself however promotes decentralization which is good. I love me some peer to peer financial services. We just need to remove localbitcoins out of the picture with regards to custodial access. Multisig is a must!

and even if they did - they would be better off financially receiving the block rewards than attacking devaluing their own investment. Check section 6 of the whitepaper.
There are a lot of naive assumptions here.
First...once again, we are discussing BCH, **not** Bitcoin. You seem confused about this and I'm not sure why. 
Second, the assumption that it is more profitable to mine bch than to 51% attack it with massive shorts is hilarious. You are engaging in a false dichotomy. You believe this black and white world where only bch or only Bitcoin exists. That is obviously not true.
In the real world both exist. In the real world, much has changed since the original Bitcoin white paper and if you do not update your information to sync with reality unsure how to help you.
The truth is bch is a **competitor** to Bitcoin. That means it's within the realm of financial rationality to ensure that your Bitcoin mining investments are secure against devaluation from competition. That means you can not only rationally attack bch, you can do so to the tune of massive profits *not only* from shorting bch, but also from going long on BTC.
Remember, when you 51% attack bch, you are **not** devauling Bitcoin. You are devauling bch. There are multiple rational reasons to do this.
Satoshi wrote the white paper when nothing existed. There is no game theory on mining attacks for altcoins that didn't exist at the time of publication, so saying "white paper" as some sort of argument is pretty dumb.
I have pointed out this change of mining game theory many times on this sub, specifically when there was the original split. When Bitcoin split and there now existed two similar proof of work systems it *completely* changes the threat model. You can't ignore facts and talk about something some dude wrote before any of these facts existed.

A) Fire all employee's

You should be more open to substantiating your opinions, otherwise people will simply laugh at/ignore you.
Also, stating that gemini is using a "unneccesarily trusting" peg is kind of redundant and pointless isn't it? You are already uneccesarily trusting a centralized entity by preforming personal or business transactions on the gemini platform.
Once you adequately describe alternative pegging methods that currently exist, maybe I will change my opinion on that statement. As of right now, its impossible for me to do so without more information.
If you do adequately describe alternative pegging mechanisms, then I would simply state those mechanisms should be utilized on DAX's, eliminating centralized/custodial models. If a custodial/regulated entity wishes to provide custodial/regulated peg's, then why nitpick it? You are already dancing with the devil, whats wrong with taking a little sip of the devils whiskey?

Wouldn't you agree that Monero cannot be exchanged/liquidated for various assets/capital at the same level as bitcoin?
How many exchanges accept monero? How many exchanges accept bitcoin? How many brick and mortar stores accept Monero vs Bitcoin? How many Markets/Vendors accept Monero Vs Bitcoin?
These questions demonstrate which asset has higher fungibility. 
Ultimately it is the *availibility* to exchange an asset for another that determines fungibility. Monero handles the technical side extremely well (at large costs, hopefully substantially reduced by bulletproofs), in that it makes it impossible to differentiate one monero from another, *creating the pathway* for fungibility, but the technicals cannot create societal acceptance.
Ultimately it is society that determines the value of an asset, and it is society that creates the infrastructure for exchange, which is what determines fungibility. Monero is still the new kid on the block and hasn't gotten anywhere near the traction that bitcoin has, so despite Monero having a higher privacy oriented system, it still has not reached anywhere near the fungibility of bitcoin.

I have nothing against capitalism and see it as an essential part of a healthy society. Social spending towards welfare services is included in this mix.
Do not confuse the term "free market" with capitalism. They are entirely different terms that have overlapping but are not the same. Free markets do not exist. Don't believe me? Go ahead, provide a single example of a modern free market. I will then explain how the example you have just provided is no such thing. 
Modern economists recognize this, and social liberal democracy is dependent upon hybrid models. These models that have a large share of spending assigned to social programs are the best places in the world to live right now, including your country.
The problem, and perhaps the reason I am being downvoted, is because Americans (I am one) are generally ignorant fucking retards and confuse socialsm with social democracy. This is a constant problem in our society and what people commonly refer to as "socialsim" is actually social democracy.
Perhaps I was wrong to assume OP confused the term, but I *rarely* run into people that understand the difference, and much more often than not they use socialism to mean social democracy.
I do not think your Nordic country is a socialist Utopia. However, if you analyze government spending of tax dollars, you will find a large portions is devoted to social programs such as education and health care.
I am not a socialist. Economies that are entirely socialist fail and are horrible models for Society. But modern liberal democracy requires both aspects of socialsm *and* capitalism. It is stupid to pretend your government does not engage in socialistic activity. America is no exception, yet I often find Yanks don't understand this basic fact.

Do people realize how many articles like this have been written the past 20 years? I've been reading this kind of shit for decades. No, the dollar is not going to suddenly lose it's power. It's a slow leak that can be empirically measured by examining government's allocation of USD in their reserve baskets. 
USD used to be &gt; 90% global dominant, but now we are closer to 60% (haven't checked in a few years but I imagine it hasn't slipped too much.)
The article isn't wrong about the bigger picture here, the USA definitely should not ignore the trend and these countries will gain power as the US loses it. But it's not happening "quickly" ....ever. Even at the next major recession nothing will change.
Ironic to think that right now bitcoins biggest threat is now state backed cryptocurrencies. Places like Russia and Venezuela creating their own cryptocurrencies will put **extreme** regulatory pressure upon bitcoin.

Good guy SEC, pandering to hardcore bitcoiners.
My concerns with Bitcoin ETFs has always been that it will do to Bitcoin what it has done to gold - artificial inflation via paper shares.
The entire selling point of Bitcoin is limited supply. We know from the paper gold industry that there are many more "shares" of gold than there exists physical delivery, creating this artificial inflation.
The catch is this - it's a card house. Gold can continue to flourish as a stable reserve asset so long as large amounts of people don't try to take more physical delivery than what exists.
This is the kind of bullshit Bitcoin was designed to *prevent*.
I see the ETF as an eventuality. It will happen. Yes, despite all OPs claims. Bakkt will change the SECs tune, give it time. We cannot control the SEC, we cannot control bitcoin ....we are all here for the ride.

Huh....that's actually a interesting scenario. Essentially we (in the USA) did the same thing after the 2008 recession. In 2009, every single american got a single lump sum payment (I think it was around $800 USD each) to encourage spending and to try and dig us out of our recession.
So 90 days would be 3 months @ 30 usd, so a total of 90usd in the form of a stimulus package to each working citizen. To us in the US, this seems like such a incredibly small amount, but to the citizens of Venezuela who have been living on $2 usd per month, this would represent a greater than 10x fold in income, which should lead to stronger spending, therefore better economy/business stability. 
It could actually work. It will be fascinating to see how this plays out.

The jokes on you unfortunately OP. "Satoshi's vision" is a term we use to mock bcashers. It's never to be used seriously because the majority of bitcoiners don't see Satoshi as a god, nor do we see his "vision" as a mandate.
90%+ of the code that exists in the current implementation is not even satoshi's. Afaik, most of the code written as of now was rewritten by Gavin, who did the Lions share of the work for several years. Think of how silly it would be to use the term "Gavin's vision"? Well we all know how that played out....turns out Gavin's vision was to be constantly bamboozled by scammers and to give up on the project.....**just like Satoshi**.
Satoshi gave the world the source code and left the (emergency) keys for others. Not only do I not care what his vision is, apparently he didn't either *because he left*. If his vision was so important he would have at least written a email or something in the past 5 years right?
Except he didn't. He clearly wants the system to organically evolve. 
The people using his supposed vision as a path forward are either con artists or people stupid and gullible enough to believe those con artists. Those people left our community and started their own, called bitcoin cash.
They are now reaping the rewards from the chaos they sowed. Who would have thought attacking all of the most intelligent engineers, distrusting all of the best solutions and centralizing everything would result in a failing platform? Such mystery, much wow.
We have a very basic saying here on this sub and it's simply that Satoshi is not a god, nor is it a religion. His vision is entirely irrelevant because good science will always come before God.

First, you are using a unrealistic qualifier. There does not exist "perfect" fungibility. Ironically, the closest we have to perfect fungibility is cash. So not helping your narrative.
So you can toss that term out the window, all it does is muddy up the conversation to no purpose at all.
Secondly, I don't think you even know the definition of fungible, so your ability to declare others knowledge on the subject is at best a jest.


Notice how it uses the word "essentially" and not "perfectly" ? Thats because you are making shit up and clearly don't understand what fungible means.


OP made the assumption that these coins would be blocked from coinbase. OP made the assumption based on erroneous evidence and has provided *zero* proof that these coins came from the silk road.
The only "proof" we have of these coins origin is from a [block explorer that says its actually from MtGox]( and since we don't know the rational/evidence behind *their* assumption, you are merely building a house of assumptions here, each one leaning on the prior.
Considering these points, the only thing going on here is a bunch of assclowns on reddit stacking assumptions on top of assumptions.

How have bitcoin proponents defrauded bitcoin cash investors?
You are making a false equivalence. There is direct evidence of manipulation and fraud to deceive from roger, but where is that happening from *any* proponents of bitcoin core, let alone *bitcoin core developers or associated organizations*?
You have to remember that roger ver is literally the head guy for bitcoin cash. He represents the community because he funds projects, colludes with miners and engages *in business activity* for bitcoin cash. No one "owns" bitcoin cash, but if anyone could be said to be "in charge", I would think Roger would be everyones  pick. Not because he owns it, but because *he has the most influence*. A person with majority influence in a consensus system can sway the outcome any way he desires, I really do hope you understand this.
That makes him way way different than some random reddit user making claims. He is providing business services. He has both an ethical and legal duty to his customers to fairly represent the truth.

I have not seen any research to validate this theory, but would love to read some if you have it! The most widely accepted consensus on this particular issue has to do with repetitive appeal to authority. Those who suffer from logic constraints *can* be convinced otherwise, but only if they hear this conflicting opinion from an authority figure they respect within their social circles.
I have [posted extensively]( about this (warning, long, but thorough) ...but if you wish to tl:dr it and jump straight to the sauce ...
[Network science on belief system
dynamics under logic constraints](


To bring this back to the faction of or BU/big block vs the Core, small block, decentralized faction.....


and Z are true) does not imply belief consensus. It will polarize a population into two opposing ideological factions when high certainty of belief on one central statement implies high certainties of belief on all other statements, and
low certainty of belief on that central statement implies low certainties of belief on all other statements. One faction accepts the premise of the central statement and thus accepts all the other statements as true; the other rejects the premise of the central statement and thus rejects all the other statements as false.
You see this endlessly perpetuated in politics. You see one faction completely ignore all the truthful statements of the other faction because they no longer believe in the central statement. Similarly, the same has occured here where because of the social division created by theymos (not singlehandedly of course, but also because of Gavin and other factors). 
Now, we get to what I see as the meat and potato's of the issue. People are now ideologically divided into factions and evidence based research is no longer effective against ideologically driven agendas. To understand this better....


The paper goes into an illustrative example to explain this...its long, but well worth the read to understanding this phenomenon. 


truth statements involved in the decision to invade Iraq may be understood. During the period
1992 to 2002, U.S. public opinion polls indicated  that a slight majority supported an invasion of
Iraq, and that a strong majority favored waiting for the conclusion of UN inspections on the status
of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction (19–22). In January 2003, President Bush’s State of the Union address included a threat assessment of Iraq’s weapons and intentions. He stated, “We will consult, but let there be no misunderstanding: If Saddam Hussein does not fully disarm for the safety of our people, and for the peace of the world, we will lead a coalition to disarm him.” In February 2003, Colin Powell, the highly respected U.S. Secretary of State and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke to the UN Security Council. Polling just prior to the speech indicated that a strong majority of the public viewed Powell’s forthcoming speech as an important factor in settling their minds about an attack on Iraq (23). The speech (24) presented a logic structure on three truth statements:


of weapons of mass destruction.


mass destruction are real and present dangers
to the region and to the world.


would be a just war.


public and announced Operation Iraqi Freedom. He stated, “The people of the United States and our friends and allies will not live at the mercy of an outlaw regime that threatens the peace with weapons of mass murder.” The 2003 invasion of Iraq began a few days later. In the immediate March-May aftermath of the invasion, polling indicated a surge to strong majority support of the preemptive invasion. With the failure to find any evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, polling indicated that a strong majority of the public believed that the
Iraq War was based on incorrect assumptions (25). In September 2005, Colin Powell acknowledged that his UN speech was based on flawed intelligence reports.


This should help demonstrate what has been going on in our community for many years now. The solution to this problem is to convince authority figures within the bcash community to retract their opinions. This obviously will not happen, so it is probably market mechanisms which will ultimately determine outcome since there are few authority figures left that bcash supporters will trust and that speak the truth.
Apparently the opinions of Nick Szabo are just not enough for them, stupid as they are.

If you have 50+ million in assets, and you want to maximize the cash value, you do not just put in a market order....you set a price, you put 5-10% at that price, then you set another sell order at a price slightly above that, put another 5-10% more, etc etc.
Ya'll can downvote all you want, but only fools would sell that as a market order and cause massive slippage.

No. That would never happen. You might as well ask whether we could change the inflation schedule to be 42M instead of 21M coins. Such a option would never reach consensus.
Thats a feature of decentralized networks. The difficulty in which it is to *change*.
Satoshi set the inflation schedule as-is for very specific reasons. I cannot disagree with his reasoning. That in specific being the security of the network. While it is arguable that the network can maintain its security on fee's alone now, it would mean a major reduction in hashpower. This is great for the environmental cause, but not great for bitcoins security model.

Can I prove that bitcoin cash is not a scam today? No, obviously it has moved into a grassroots community regardless of the people who launched and advocated for it. Like a parastic disease that has propagated throughout society, its here to stay whether we like it or not.
I can prove that the people who have advocated for it are scammers however. Thats good enough for me to know that this is a shitcoin, even if not considering the complete lack of scientific merit in regards to the scaling implementation that bch uses.
Listen...we had this debate years ago. The result was the creation of BCH and its infinityblockchain and btc moving forward on proposals with scientific merit, e.g. heavily debated and discussed amongst academic circles.
Unlike the BCH scene, which is filled with non-academics and proven scam artists.
You want to re-hash the debate go for it, but I wont be participating. I participated in the debate *literally thousands of times* over the last 4 years. Look at my comment history and my karma and you can see the vast majority of it was earned here through public discussion of topics.
The time for debate is long over. The time for moving forward and fighting the opposition is here. Bitcoin split and thats probably for the good of our community, but that does *not* mean that we should keel over and pretend that there is no damage to be done through misinformation campaigns and propaganda by the likes of Roger Ver, Calvin Ayre and CSW aka fake satoshi.
Maybe you don't know the history. Maybe you don't realize that the **only** reason there is a BCH today is because of the mining conglomorate bitmain and its attempt to further monopolize the mining industry with covert ASICBOOST. Maybe you weren't here when that all played out, but here's how it went -
-No way, segwit is bad for (insert lies here)
-if UASF works, we will be launching MASF (miner activated SF) b2x coin
-UASF worked
-BCH launched under "mysterious" circumstance (really, we are supposed to ignore the fact that bitmain literally admitted they were going to launch a miner activated shitcoin in response to UASF in public domain, and then pretend it was not them behind BCH?)
BCH is literally a chinese miner scamcoin.
This "debate" is not a debate at all. All I see is anti-intellectualism on one side, and feverant fools with lies on the other.

I would say crypto markets are as close as we get in the modern age, but are not free markets.
The reason being that in most jurisdictions, ones ability to use these markets are limited by their domestic countries regulations. If you live in Panama, or Hong Kong, then your ability to interact freely with these markets is much greater (but still not 100%) compared to Western countries. HK is rated as the "most free" country in terms of free market economics, but even they are rated at 88% "free".
You cannot have unrestricted competition on a global market as there is regulatory arbitrage. The barrier to entry prevents fair and unrestricted competition. I, as a US citizen, cannot freely act upon unregulated exchanges without consideration of tax law etc. This changed my behavior and ability to act unrestricted in these markets.
I stand by my statement there are no free markets in *modern* society. If you want a current non modern example you have to seek out isolated indigenous tribes, such as the inuit people above the tree lines in North America.

I'm very careful to use the word ignorant instead of stupid. Ignorant is not a negative term it is simply a statement of lack of knowledge. One cannot expect others to be instantly knowledgeable on complex topics like neurology, quantum physics, nuclear science, cryptography, Etc....
Being called ignorant should never be construed as an insult yet it unfortunately is quite frequently. I am ignorant on an endless amounts of topics within Society but that does not make me stupid it just makes me not trained in a specific category.
We live in a dunning-kruger society where people think that they are somehow instantly learned in one category simply because they have spent a reasonable time living or learning other categories.
It is important to constantly remind people that intellectualism is not just the pursuit of knowledge but also the acknowledgement of self ignorance.
Giancomo should use the term ignorant instead of stupid.
It's clinically proven that when you piss someone off their ability to rationalize is turned down and therefore it is less likely to have a constructive or learning experience with them.
So if your goal is to change people's minds, don't call them stupid. Personally if I call someone stupid it's because I've decided that it's impossible to change their mind..... Well because they're stupid.

I cannot tell if you are joking, serious, or both? A brief reading if you are serious -
But the short answer, other than the massive ecosystem and 100's of millions of living animals, is that the ice sheet reflects a large part of the sun's energy. When we loose that reflectivity, the earth warms up. This speeds up melting, resulting in a feedback loop that will cause massive rises in sea levels, literally gobbling up islands and cities.
Life as it exists today will not be possible with no Artic sheets. Many places on the earth will become physically impossible to live in. Places like hot deserts will be so hot that the human body cannot cool itself, resulting in heat death. This will cause human migration north in the **billions**, which means that 1st world countries in nice area's are going to get a population-run effect and no amount of military is going to stop billions of people.
If you live in North America, understand that as the earth heats up so does migration. All this "build the wall" stupidity? Yea, its not going to stop a billion Central/South Americans migrating north when the planet becomes 10C hotter.

That will be decided by the supreme court as businesses sue the state of NY over infractions.
The state can impose whatever they want, but ultimately it is up to the courts to decide what is constitutional. 
That means these draconian regulations WILL be implemented by the state (because really, who's going to stop the state from doing what they want to do?), and over the course of several years the regulations will be tested on a legal basis in a trial and error.
Businesses will fail, and others will stand up for our rights in the courts. I feel poorly for those small startups who will inevitably fail without ever having the legal fire power to fight back. They are all casualties in this bitcoin crusade.

The developers are the ones with the fullest knowledge on the system and solutions. If they cannot resolve their differences, under what system of logic do you believe that it would be efficient for miners to determine the best solution?
The developers need to come to a consensus on their own so that the miners can choose more wisely. Miners are just people who bought machines to run. They are not experts, just money makers. I understand the voting mechanism that is inclusive to miners, but I think you are giving them way too much credit to be making such large decisions without developers first reaching consensus.

The point of bitcoin is to not rely upon central actors. What happens when XYZ country enacts specific rules, like black lists formed from coin analytics companies?
Xapo will have no choice but to comply because their shareholders would rather vote for compliance than to block residents from that country because it makes more sense to maximize customers and therefore profits.
The same economic incentive model that makes a decentralized Bitcoin great makes centralized Corporate models so shitty to citizens.
The entire point of Bitcoin is to be your own bank. Xapo is expecting to control supply based on a model of consumer ignorance, which will give them enormous power for lending activity once they secure government approval. As long as the governments recognize Bitcoin as valid collateral then Xapo will turn into a traditional fractional reserve lender.

Im more than interested to hear how low-latency (which is really a much better name than 'high frequency') trading is possible on a decentralized platform.
If there is no central point in which you can 'one up' someone elses trade before it occurs, then the process is made impossible.
HFC would be (and I think already is) used with trading bots on current centralized exchanges like stamp, btc-e, etc. I used to watch those bots fight all day long over pennies, and in others sharing their experiences with me, a few noticed their trade getting executed by others before it could be executed by the exchange, which would directly imply HFC.

In the one example, yes. Obviously discussing the impact of future technology is speculative.
I think your ideological thinking is lacking in real world data. Research has shown that the more social services provided, the greater positive effect upon society. Same with regulation that benefits the citizenry.
A healthy functional society does not exist without structure, and that structure does not exist without taxation. You want to ignore cause and effect so you can speak about ideological beliefs. Life does not exist in a vacuum.
What you see as "theft" and "immoral" I see as an mandatory part of creating a better society for everyone.

So I followed up to see your response, and look there, you deleted it. Your claims of being a wallet dev are however, forever immortalized in my quote of yours.
I would also like to point out that anyone can inspect the javascript code either in-browser after visiting the site, or via github, but that doesn't change the attack vector.
If you think it is reasonable for every person to inspect javascript elements prior to entering their password....well, obviously you would not be a rational person worth discussing anything with if you think thats reasonable.
The entire point of my original context was that a 3rd party can compromise the server and alter/inject malicious javascript that redirects both the wallet container *and* the password to a 3rd party.
Yes, **you** might be able to inspect the code and see whats going on, but the 99.999999999999999999999999% of users cannot or **will not** do so.
The point still stands. The best way to transact with bitcoin is through secure hardware devices that have little or no known attack vectors.
Even this is not trustless. You must trust the manufacturers, but at least you can build confidence that these devices are likely not compromised, or only compromised in highly unrealistic scenarios with physical access.

I also read another research paper which I frustratingly did not put in my saved that proved price does indeed follow hashpower, but the result is lagged. It was between 3-6 months variance of a lagged response. I'm kicking myself now for not saving as these tend to be difficult to find.
You are not wrong about miners following price. This is *also* true. You just fail to understand that both of these scenarios can happen, they are not mutually exclusive of each other.

Price follows (lagged) mining hashpower. So the difficulty can adjust all it wants, if it's going down then so is the price. If the price is going down it's unlikely miners will choose less profits on a shitcoin who is about to split over childish drama.

It would be great if Marvel did this, but did easter eggs inside the comics that allow you to extract the private key.

1) - bitcoin.com is the first search result when googling "buy Bitcoin" and is acting as a exchange/service provider. Are you really comparing Reddit posts to deceptive business practices?
2) anyone can call anything by any name they like, but isn't it a bit hypocritical to *literally cry* about it, and then do it on a even larger, more damaging, deceptive level? 
Or does defrauding investors not matter to you? Seems like you are siding with the conman, which makes *you* a fraud for enabling his fraud.

That is simply untrue. There exists extensive regulation that seeks to serve regulation of property rights, as in my example, of regulation upon factories that poison downstream water, and property. Such regulation is not an infringement upon individual rights, in fact I would argue it is the opposite, a *preservation* of individual rights, *combined* with preservation of property rights.


This may be true, but it does not seek to absolve the logical inconsistency with your assertion that you can have regulations of property law but not individual rights. The two, while not mutually exclusive, can have overlapping.
It appears you don't understand the wide net of regulation, or its impacts? If the government seeks to regulate a factory, preventing it from dumping its waste into the river, this is not just so that it does not poison *property*, but also so that it does not poison *everyone*. The preservation of health is a universal liberty and absolutely is mutually exclusive.


On December 10, 1948 the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted and
proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights the full text of which appears in
the following pages.
Article 25 -


of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical
care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of
unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of
livelihood in circumstances beyond his control. 
Do you disagree with these universal rights? Do you think that health is not a human right?
Do you think that it is *not* the role of the government to regulate business activity that **preserves** this universal human right to health? If not, then how would this right be enforced?


You mean this?


That was not a answer to my question, nor did it resolve the logical  inconsistency of your position. My specific question was...


Your answer cannot simply be "the government would be the monopoly on force and keep it" as it does not address the issue. The issue, specifically, is *how* will the government be a monopoly on force without taxation?
A government cannot keep a *well funded* militia without taxation. A non-well-funded militia will logically be a *weak* militia, which will then be subject to being overpowered by neighboring countries/warlords/aristocrats/oligarchs ...all of which will have more monetary power than your government since your government does not collect taxes.

I would agree with this statement, however looking at the last 24 hours I've watched approx 20-30k btc get dumped and we've only lost 1k in market value. And thats on *one single exchange*.
That means that there has been literally 100k + bitcoins sold in the last 24 hours with only 1k in slippage. Thats a shitload of liquidity.
My point still stands true. Anyone can dump any 8 figure sum on a large exchange without slippage given they structure their sell orders as a professional trader would who has decided to exit the market to maximize profits.

Damn, its gotten that bad? Im way behind my study of ETH's mining situation :/
Well, for me, I always saw ETH as a corporate coin, a centralized variant of bitcoin that is to be adopted by the financial incumbents of society to accomplish their goals.
This doesn't diminsh the way I view ETH. The more centralized it becomes, the more efficient it will be, which is exactly what incumbents want. A nice controllable beast to pull the wagon...not some crazed horse who will shy and yank at nothing.
I presumed the lack of ASICs in ETH would lead to a greater distribution ....which is *probably* true (Im not 100% certain), but  its also important to remember that just because a pool has hashrate doesn't mean it controls that hashrate. Those clients can bail out at a moments notice, as we saw in the ghash.io scare of 2014 when they briefly topped 51%

Good thing there's not only one implementation, or one scaling solution then. I had assumed you were the typical sock puppet coming over from to spread your ignorant propaganda...but maybe I had you pegged wrong?

I count [15 bitcoin implementations]( and I count [7 Lightning implementations]( as well as Rootstocks Lumino, which is already live and claims to achieve 100TPS (a approx 35x fold in scaling).
You should spend more time researching about bitcoin and less time parroting the ignorant bullshit you read.

Im very frustrated and have spent hours looking for this study I read earlier this year [and not finding it] that projected that even if humanity could learn to recycle 90% of all of its materials/waste/energy, that we would only add less than 100 years to our races life expectancy.
The gist of the study is that it models the exponential consumption rate of our global economy, and projects humanity can only continue at this pace for around 550 years or so. With the 90% recycling ability accounted for, we would only continue to exist at the same production levels for 650ish.
In short, it was a very dismal study that expects human kind to 'run out' of necessary resources to sustain life within half a thousand years or so. 
I think we will suffer a major catastrophe that will change our line of thinking in terms of exponential growth and we will reduce it at some point for the sake of humanity. Hopefully advanced technology will help us in this process. If not, we perish :) I dont think that will happen though. I think civilization will just collapse, and we will start over again with massively reduced population.

I have not read anything regarding any of the IBM details you just spoke of. If you want to be taken seriously, provide a source. Otherwise, it sounds like incoherent rambling.
ASIC's are highly specialized machines that work magnitudes faster at crunching SHA256 and Scrypt. When I say magnitudes, what I mean is that it would take ten's of thousands of 'internet of things' devices to secure the network the same way that a couple of miners would. Which makes all these idea's you just pulled out of thin air seem beyond worthless for the primary function: *Securing the network*.
You again are lacking significant knowledge on *how the network is secured*. This is a redundancy of your gaps of knowledge demonstrating your lack of education on this topic.

Many services, like wallet providers (circle), exchange platforms (localbitcoins, bitstamp) use 'internal mixers' to send transactions across its own network to its own peers.
It is basically a 'IOU' that gets redeemed when someone wishes to remove bitcoin from their account to send to another platform (blockchain.info, circle, anywhere that accepts btc). When withdrawn from the system, it hits the 'real' blockchain and you can see the tx show up and validate.

Of course there exists profitable centralized business models with highly scalable and large data networks.
However if you didnt understand the difference between decentralized cryptocurrencies and centralized business models before, I doubt you will get it now. You cannot scale on chain and retain decentralization. This is not a speculative opinion, it's a fact that anyone, even yourself, should be able to grasp.
So you have to choose between the two different models. We already have highly scalable centralized money ....it's called Fiat. It sounds like to me you don't understand Bitcoin. At all.

Well for one, these models cannot work with Fiat. I just watched someone I know get burned on a 2k + transaction through paxful. Guy provided I'd, selfie, phone number before the wire, had a good rep,and ended up getting returned within 2 weeks after the wire deposited. And the sad part is is that it could have been 2 weeks, 2 months, or six months and the bank would have still demanded the money back since it was fraud. There is no way any buyer would let you hold escrow on a transaction for months to make sure that you are safe against fraud.
He did everything he was supposed to do to prevent fraud and still got fucked. There is no way for any centralized entity to prevent bank fraud unless they act as the broker and absorb the risk. You cannot do this in a decentralized way.
He's been waiting for months for Gemini to improve his institutional account and as an attempt to make the transaction in a peer-to-peer fashion resulted in him getting fucked. So fuck Gemini, fuck paxful, and fuck fraudsters. The worst part is he's probably going to get his bank account closed over this all because some asshole scammer double fucked him.
But for crypto to crypto? Hell yes, everyone should be using bisq! But clearly this model does not work for the current Legacy Financial system. And we have to be honest with ourselves we are not to that point yet where we can ditch the existing Financial system.

Except that blockchain has blocked access to those addresses that have been published.  You are unable to do anything with them within your wallet.
Of course, if you have a backup wallet in your email from when the address was generated, and you want to import it into multibit (or whatever the recommended wallet was called), and then broadcast a  tx of a specific amount agreed upon between you and mandrik(you would have to send one to the address in question first, wait for conf, etc), which carries risk of being swept out anyways since we know others control these same addresses now....
You could just take 10 seconds to create a new wallet, and another 5 seconds to push all the btc from your old wallet to the new.
Which one seems more reasonable and feasible to ALL individuals? People use blockchain.info for convenience. Most users would not even know how to setup a wallet, let alone to do all of the above.
Im not trying to hip hip horray bc.i in all of this, because they *have* failed miserably, but there is a extent of rationalism that we must use approaching this situation and everyone who has responded and upvoted this top comment apparently is not fully aware of how bc.i works.

Every user votes with their wallet. They choose which chain to transact on and *that* is how coin holders play into this scenario. Both the miners and the users transact on-chain in their own ways that have signifigance and impact upon governance.
I understand that you think that there is a better way. You should start your own coin then with these rules if you feel they are better. 


Seems to me that's what you want? I certainly don't. I'm firm in my understanding that miner signaling was a poor method for upgrading the protocol and that mistake will never be done again. Read rusty Russell's blog on the subject where he admits this is his fault.
Clearly the governance structure is intentionally messy. Bitcoin is supposed to be hard to upgrade. There needs to be friction in the process otherwise the system will quickly be hijacked by the very people you despise.

Clearly you dont get it. There has to be a incentive for the community to participate, and there must be excessive participation in order for it to be secure. Otherwise centralized control is needed, and it is therefore no longer a decentralized technology. One of the main points of bitcoin is its decentralization, meaning that there is no center point to be attacked.

What happens when they send a empty box ? Or counterfeit bills? What if this person has spent months in the long-con building up a legit reputation doing small trades, or maybe even trades with himself using alternative accounts?
What happens when the mail is seized by customs or the shipping service after finding a load of cash? Even though its not illegal to mail cash in the mail, its definitely suspicious in large quantities and they *will* seize it and make you come in and do some explaining to get it back. Probably with authorities present.
I think its wrong to pretend this is a viable option, it seems to me this option has just as much risk, just different kinds of risk.
I would think that the best way to conduct business is face to face, where you can ensure both parties are satisfied before releasing escrow. But this too has major risks, especially if you are not careful. If you are legit, and not a scammer or someone planning criminal mischeif, then you should be meeting at a bank or a safe public place to conduct such a transaction.

You cannot expect us to stand down to such malicious and damaging behavior. A person who believes in Bitcoin will fight tooth and nail to prevent inflation of their assets, and the centralization of resources that diminish the security model.
The entire point of Bitcoin is to give us a viable alternative to wealth preservation, opting out of centralized systems whose history has proven to steal wealth 100% of the time.

There is a difference between conmen who have intentional malice and people who want to do good but are misguided or self deluded.

Vitalik has his own category of crazy, can never figure out if he believes the crazy shit that comes out of his own mouth or is the most intelligent/deceptive of them all.
Just put Roger Jihan and Craig in their own category, they belong together. The others deserve objective criticism but not accusations of fraud. Some minor deceptive practices to be sure, but not outright fraud.

Did you seriously not realize that *all* first world countries are a *majority* socialist structure? Why do you think places like Scandinavia have *literally* the highest happiness in the world?
Yeah, it sure sucks having health care, free education for your kids and a safe place to live. Dur Hur, we should get rid of all of that so that we can let privately owned monopolies fuck us in the ass until we die early of violence, health or depression.
I'm so glad the Roger ver types have left Bitcoin and moved to shitcash so that we can get rid of all these free market idealogists. Your free market doesn't exist, nor is it a solution to most problems in society. But it sure does create a fuckload more problems.....
Free markets are a great *model* for the trading of goods in a society. *If* such a thing were to exist. But it does not. Civilized society is not all about competition, a lot of times it is about empathy and doing the right thing. That's why governments exist.....because people are fucking animals and when we grow beyond dunbars number we stop giving a shit about others near us.
Basic science explains this. I think most people don't understand human nature and have these ignorant ideological beliefs on how we *should* be without recognizing how we *really work*.

Even though I can see this, it's very difficult to understand from a personal perspective. For me, the urge is to engage in confrontation, to fight it out to determine the victor. But I watch so many others, at the first sight of friction go "nah, I will pass".
I have such conflicted thoughts about this. At a personal level, avoidance equates to less stress and higher personal happiness. At a societal level, this behavior is insidious and has far reaching negative consequences.
Funny how Anarchists are so hardocre about personal responsibility (I love this about them)...but in this scenario it provides illumination as to why these systems do not work. There will always be vastly more humans attempting to escape personal responsibility than there are those willing to take personal loss to uphold them. Our dna is programmed with millions of years of survival priority, and it is within our fundamental nature to secure ourselves (or our family) before others.
Fuck this selfishness is a virtue bullshit that I hear from Ayn Rand lovers here. That behavior, while is great for *you*, fucking sucks for everyone else. It creates a world of vicious assholes and massive societal instability. Society works much better when people have empathy and compassion for those less fortunate. Piketty proves this in his Capitalism book with empirical data going back to the 1600's. The ecosystem of countries are always more beneficial to *all* participants when there is legislation that regulates with fairness to society instead of to the individual. This sucks for the 1%, yes. But they are the 1%.....they don't lack for any need. Set for life.

Agreed. I cringed every moment of this video. Of course we need to do better, but we must also be realistic with the adoption rate of new technology. Just like SMS for phones, or credit cards, they were very tedious technologies for many, MANY years before there was the innovation that made the process smooth.
Bitcoin started to see mainstream adoption this year. I wouldnt expect a average user friendly experience until at *least* 2016 if not longer.
Good news is VC's are pouring hundreds of millions into tech companies that are doing just this. Thats why I think 2016 is realistic, instead of 2020.

This is assuming that this energy is offsetting other sources. This is probably not true most of the time. The plants are designed to be well above capacity, so if the city needs 5gWh the plant may have 20 or 50 gWh. The energy would be wasted by not being used.
Perhaps in dense cities where plants are at Max capacity? In my area of southern California our grids are at Max capacity often, but we do not have any major renewable sources near by. Only one nuclear plant who's power does not even reach us where we are, and is so old it needs to be shut down.

I'm still processing this, but I believe in the old version if the misbehaving party gets their broadcast confirmed the other party is fucked. In the new version the other party can broadcast a newer state even after a on chain confirmation and (somehow?) Spend the output of the confirmed tx. I believe the output and it's amount are settled at the time of creating the contract so it serves no purpose to attempt to misbehave now as the victim can *always* retrieve their funds, regardless of how much time has past, so long as they have a newer sequenced state.

Saying that we can just 'change the algo' and 'start over' is simplifying a very large and complex issue.
In order for bitcoin to have value, there must be faith. And if the network is seriously undermined to the point that it would require 100's of millions of dollars of mining equipment to suddenly be worthless, then how do you think the community could recover from such a disaster? Most of the miners who got fucked are not going to want to buy new mining equipment all over again. It would already be a mega loss, why dig the hole deeper?
If such a thing occured, it would take years to rebuild the network, and thats a big 'if'.

***"1. Introduction
A number of Web-based payment services exist that are capable of initiating and transmitting a payment from a sending party to a receiving party. While the details of how the transfer occurs often differ from provider to provider, the information necessary to initiate the transfer of funds are typically the same. There exists the mention of a receiving party, the amount, a currency, and usually a description of the payment.
The following are all examples of valid Payment Links according to this specification:

The cointelegraph author then goes on to speculate that...


This leaves me with 2 thoughts.
1- Bitcoin/blockchain are inseparable. Support one, support the other. Since buttercoin is essentially a exchange, I cannot understand why wedbush would be interested in it other than to speculate. Perhaps they are using buttercoin to create a market for themselves and plan to compete with Medici in providing financial trading services for other assets using the bitcoin protocol?
2- Going by wedbush's statements in their papers, it seems that they would be more interested in CounterParty/Ethereum than they would be in just investing into bitcoin, as counterparty/etherum can "...be used to replace traditional intermediaries by acting as an exchange mechanism for a multitude of transactions". Unless of course they plan on competing with that model.

Why buy a computer now when you can wait 6-12 months for a better one? The simple answer is need.
Deflationary industry exists and thrives off capital investments and purchases, it just must be driven by need. People will still buy plenty of things in a deflationary market, they just might not frivolously spend as much. I see that as a change that is needed for all of the world. We don't need to be making or buying more *shit*, we need what we need, and a little more, not a lot more.

This relies upon the assumption that bitcoin would become the most utilized currency in society, without the effects of other inflationary currencies have upon the credit/capital cycles discussed in the paper.
As the author of the paper states, they think this is incredibly unlikely.


such that the inflationary dynamics have an impact on society. In our view this is an unlikely
outcome and perhaps should be considered even more unlikely by Bitcoin’s critics. In our view,
Bitcoin may satisfy a useful niche, that of making both censorship resistant and digital payments,
but it’s unlikely to become the main currency in the economy. Therefore the debate about Bitcoin’s
deflationary nature should be considered as largely irrelevant anyway. Hence it is therefore
somewhat odd that some critics use this as an argument against Bitcoin.
I think we are jumping ahead of ourselves trying to proclaim something this research states, when the author has made it quite clear they don't think that scenario will ever fold into reality. This reminds me a lot about the libertarian arguments made about how to have better societies. They are not wrong, if these utopia scenario's existed, if *everyone* could uphold personal-responsibility and actually give a shit about others in society, then this system could of course work and make for a great society.
But it wont. Because humans are naturally evolved to be selfish mammals. We will obstruct and fight each other for personal gain, leading to natural inequalities within the system, with concentrated powers [readily documented, such as zipf's law]( taking over. Humans can certianly fight our nature, and put rules into place to regulate them, and have *reasonably* balanced societies, which is of course the basis for *civilization*. So long as we allow natural forces to regulate society, then society will be in tune with nature, without any fairness doctrine applied. This leads to barbaric scenarios, where concentrated forces rule with a iron fist, through blood. The existence of societies health and wealth therefore would depend on whatever defacto authoritarian rules over that particually concentrated geographical area.
The same could be said of money. Bitcoin is a very interesting system however, as it takes these naturally selfish incentives, and applies them to work *for* the system, instead of *against* the system, which is what we have always done before.

Yes, but we are being circular here. My point was the larger market dictates the price of the smaller. Joe blows BTC exchange will follow bitfinex.
So if we open the door to paper BTC shares that market will grow larger than the native BTC assets market, causing price discovery to work backwards. 
If there is a larger demand for etf than physical supply, then the ETF provider must purchase the underlying asset, leading to a lagged price discovery mechanism. This is one way that the ETF market effects native spot price.
But what happens when a large number of ETF holders dump the market? Do you think this will have no effect on BTC spot price? Will not traders see the price movements and react to them? 
I am more than happy to discover I am wrong on this, but until I understand why I am wrong I cannot learn :) so if I'm off here, help me understand.

The CEO of PIA has written specifically and clearly that they DO NOT store logs. They do respond to the governments requests for data. They review it, and provide them with the information requested as they should, it is a legally binding request.
Since they do not log data, they give them what they have: Nothing.

You are massively underestimating the complexity of the situation. Also, saying that the miners dont need to reach consensus on a algo change is quite a null point. If the people who sustain the network do not agree to the switch, then the switch will never happen. Ignoring this reality does not make your point anymore clear.


No. Just the core dev's (no one else is involved) can implement a algo switch, and if they were to do so, everyone would get their pitch forks out and say 'fuck those guys' and life would carry on with the original fork of bitcoin. You are using fear to further your agenda but you do not understand how ignorant your viewpoint is. Just because the core dev's do something does not mean it will be adopted. Infact, with the way the system works, its highly unlikely that such a change COULD EVER be adopted. The reasoning would need to be utterly complete and clear, black and white death vs life scenario, which wont happen. 
If no one mines the new fork, its worthless. Which, is exactly what will happen unless there is a major vurn found to the hashing algo itself, which i sincerely doubt we will ever see.
This is why you are confused on the whole 'consensus' bit. You think that just because someone says "lets do this" that everyone else will come running, lining up to 'get rich' off of nothing.

Would you care to elaborate your opinion on whether you feel sidechains will cause a further centralization of mining?
Also, do you feel that by enabling sidechain support in the bitcoin protocol, will this perhaps create a environment that has less 'failure'? Satoshi specifically wanted altcoin's to flourish to enable innovation in the crypto currency spectrum. There are a lot of people arguing that sidechains would eliminate that environment.

Read the book. Its all quite clear. What you quoted above is the scare tactic they are using in attempt to prevent people from filing in the CtC fashion. The IRS is still accepting CtC based filings, because they have to. They have to, because they cannot not accept a legally filed tax return. They cannot make a CtC filing 'illegal' because if you read the book, you would realize that the CtC method of filing is just understanding how the law was originally written, and using that basis to return instead of all of the mis-information that is purposefully given by the IRS to confuse the public into 100% voluntary compliance.

I've been involved in the console hacking scene since the 90's. I know well the process involved in reverse engineering new hardware-based security as I've been fortunate enough to be friends with many of the talented individuals who have the technical acumen to accomplish these feats.
People of this caliber are not breaking into your home to steal your  HW bitcoin wallet as a fun project to crack.
They are mostly employed by companies making tidy 6 figure and multi-6 figure sums.
My entire point from the start is that you are worried about general theft and access to the device and that these concerns are invalid due to the extremely complicated nature of compromising secure hardware devices.
Your concern is not valid unless there is a well known publicly documented exploit, but even then it is trivial to upgrade to fix, so even *when* someone with this skill set tries to break the device the likelihood of success is statistically irrelevant.
In short, I do not believe your concerns have merit.

This article is failing to mention a lot of large, important facts. I think it deserves downvotes, not upvotes.
If I recall reading correctly, in its current legislation, the banks would only be able to seize assets of depositors funds that are over 250,000. Here in the USA, I believe we are insured up to that amount with FDIC , and all regular depositors funds would be safe from a 'bail in' scenario. 
So really, what we have is this:
No more poor public funding banks failures.
The rich will bail out banks if they fail.
What I THINK will happen is this:
Rich people will no longer put money into banks, and instead into things like government bonds, etc, that are more secure long term options. Hopefully this becomes a trend, and we see a massive shift of money away from banks. Remember its the ultra rich that deposit the majority of bank funds into banks. If there are laws enacted that do not protect them, they will very likely remove the money as it is very risky at that point.
As you can see, when you write article with pitch forks in mind, you'll rally the people behind you in outrage. But when you reveal the facts, and think deeper about action and reaction, cause and effect, you'll start to see the positives. Its no where near perfect, but its definitely not the big bad dark conspiracy law that its made out to be by tin hatters.
Also, this is just a copy pasta article. google the headline you'll see a bunch of 'conspiracy' minded sites babbling about it. If it was real news, it would be in real news outlets. Just read the zero hedge article if you want better information. The rest is just speculative BS.

*"However, it will develop open standards that enable different products to interoperate. It recognises that some industry giants already have payments systems — including Apple and Google — but the W3C aims to attract thousands of smaller suppliers. If the open "web commerce API" is strong enough, most companies will want to use it, if only to save development time."*
This means that bitcoin will be intergrated. If all payment systems are going to be present, then so will bitcoin.
I would like to think of this as a rigged competition, like a 50cc class racing against a 300cc single competitor (bitcoin). 
Bitcoin clearly has the advantage in a web payment environment. There is no way that any centralized payment authority could compete with the zero/low cost of bitcoin.
Aside from a catastrophic attack that could render the psychological support for bitcoin, I do not see how bitcoin could fail to be a top payment processor against all the others.

For those of you who have listened to Andrea's Postcasts, you will see his wisdom in action. No one is immune to, or should be protected from failure, but everyone benefits from the reorganization that occurs post-failure.
There are a couple issues at hand, though I would state from someone who has been in executive positions throughout his career that most of the blame does not lie on Andrea's head in this particular situation. Remember that Andreas does not personally manage the support team. Nor is his job "PR" or "Marketing". 
Because of this, you have a interesting scenario in which we can clearly see that as a CSO he has *almost* failed, though the failure was not directly his fault. I say almost because very fortunately this particular incident was played out by a honest actor instead of a unethical one. 
Because of this, we now see how important it is for a CSO to be more integrated into the other processes within the company, Support management/training, Marketing, PR, so that when security issues come up through channels normally determined to be designated for support, that the appropriate actions are taken.
No one is perfect, and we cannot expect everyone at blockchain to be perfect, including Andreas. The "Bigger Picture" is how the team is trained to respond to future threats thankfully because of this incident.
- You did the right thing. From someone who has a lack of control with emotion in critical situations, I empathize with your energy. Its difficult to not be highly critical, however at the end of things your *actions*, the most important aspect of you, have displayed a positive moral obligation to the community twofold:
Disclosing the bug in a responsible manner
Holding the team accountable *publicly* when they did not respond to the issue in a responsible fashion.
Thank you for your kind service sir. Since you are the most invested into this, please make sure to follow up in time and verify that blockchain.info has appropriately communicated the crowdcurity option throughout their support/website so these future incidents do not occur. If blockchain fails in this, then be sure to publicize it so that they can be spurred by their shame to fix things better .... :)
Now, I do have one question I would like answered When is blockchain going to implement the 0% taint solution that was promised to us 5 months ago? I've heard all the PR spin on 'general public privacy' and yadda yadda regarding coinjoin, but (might have spelt that wrong) stated that you guys had a solution ready to deploy in the "next couple weeks" over 5 months ago and since then I've not heard a peep.
If you really value the privacy aspect of bitcoin, please offer the customers of your service  a *real* privacy solution. coinjoin has been demonstrated to have little protection to privacy with a determined actor and you can bet your house that the future will create a job industry just for this particular need. We (the community) want privacy now, and we dont want to have to resort to alt coin's to accomplish that.

Cant upvote this article enough. This is essential for bitcoiners to comprehend the faults of current debt based monetary policy, and how bitcoin can be solutions to these problems. 
To me, the most important section (though all of it is very important and relevant), is section 7. I believe it details the struggle of our cycle of failure in the most comprehensive and detailed manner. Understanding this article will enable you to have intelligent conversations/retorts with people who blame capitalism for our problems. Capitalism is merely a mechanism of business practices. It is the the *way* our money supply is created and managed that is the real culprit to destructive socioeconomical forces. Section 8 really compounds the point in 7, as it details even more so how society and ecology interacts, and how finite resources makes our current system unsustainable.

Thats a serious threat we need to consider.
It does not matter how honest the pool operators are, so long as they harness a network with hashing power that is statistically capable of preforming a attack that will undermine the entire legitimacy of bitcoin then we need to assume that the possibility of attack vectors exist, and will eventually be exploited and service manipulated.
It could be a group of hackers, it could be a 3 letter word, it could be Al Gore, for all we know, but in the end it does not matter who it is, but just that it IS possible and if it IS possible then it has a high chance of occurring at some point and time.

I strongly encourage you all to read part 1 and 2! Very good read.
Part 1:
"To begin to comprehend wealth of this magnitude, one trillion is equal to 1000 billion. $32.6 trillion written out is $32,600,000,000,000.00.
Having that much wealth consolidated within a mere 1% of the population, while a record number of people toil in poverty and debt, is a crime against humanity.  For example, it would only cost 0.5% of the 1%’s wealth to eliminate poverty nationwide."
"If you are struggling to get by and running up debt to make ends meet, it is not your fault. It is the intentional outcome of government policy and economic central planning. In the present economy, it is impossible for 70% of the working age population to earn enough income to afford basic necessities, without taking on ever-increasing levels of debt, which they will never be able to pay back because there are not enough jobs that generate the necessary income to keep up with the cost of living."

I would have made a purchase this year had bitcoin black friday had any decent deals. Nothing but shit on that page. Even the newegg deals were not bitcoin specific, just the same junk they wanted to load on bitcoin users.
I do not think that using gyft to buy cards to buy products counts as a bitcoin purchase. When retailers are offering bitcoin ONLY deals where you can receive discounts greater than normal deals, payble via btc, THEN I will utilize their services to make purchases.
This bitcoin black friday was a major flop in my experience.

Could you expand with a example to explain why there would be 'extra bitcoins' in 'used coinbase addresses' ?
@_date: 2014-10-26 22:27:56
Yes, I read this on page 6 (s 120).
To clarify, im not asking for outcome so much as the varibles that may cause outcome. 
What I dont understand is, can current alt coin assets be pegged to a sidechain? Or does the ability to issue new coins depend upon the original alt's chain? Could current alt coins peg themselves to a sidechain, effectively removing their network, or would it just be another chain, thereby creating a btc side chain and having the main network chain?
From the paper: "Further still, participants do not need to be as concerned that their holdings are locked in a single
experimental altchain, since sidechain coins can be redeemed for an equal number of parent chain
coins. This provides an exit strategy, reducing harm from unmaintained software"
Does this mean the issuance of coins on the alt chain are only created when btc is 'converted' to the alt chain? Doesnt that mean all sidechain's start with 0 assets, and then when btc is transferred to it, it creates it? Or am I messing this all up? :)

As a private foundation that is representing a public cause, I feel it is very important to solidify TBF's position in regards to membership and potential bad actor's. Since it is well within the company's responsibilities to provide due diligence towards membership, I feel there is certainly a cause for action in this scenario.
My proposal:
A quarterly review process of issues submitted through the utilization of a petition form through TBF's website. The petitions should be made public, and we should have the ability to create accounts and vote whether or not the issue is of importance. I believe that the current TBF members should vote on the appropriate threshold of votes needed in order for the content to be considered for review on the quarterly review process. The threshold should be high enough to thwart frivolous claims, but not too high that it prevents TBF from doing their due diligence on important issues.
I am purposefully using generic speak for 'review process', because I believe this is some that TBF should utilize for ALL issues, and not just a issue of bad actors becoming members.
In regards to abusing the voting process, if you want extra credit you should secure the voting process through a requirement for users to be identified by pgp signature, creating a authorization process at login that requires users to prove their identity (not real identity, just pgp identity). Should should severely cut down on any 'bot abuse' utilized in the voting process. Extra extra credit for tying bitcoin protocols into the voting process ;)
I would gladly submit a satoshi in a tx (+ miners fee) to vote on important processes of the company that is supposed to be representing the best interests of our community, but I understand that not all members would, nor should there really be a financial requirement to vote :)
In Sweeden, if 100,000 signatures are collected, the issue is made into a referendum in which is then held for a public vote. This is a great democratic process that holds central authorities responsible for their actions when public outcry becomes severe. Considering TBF is a central authority representing a decentralized technology, I believe this would be a excellent practice to put into usage at TBF.
Best regards, and thank you for the incredible amount of work you have done for one of the most important projects of our lifetimes.

Here's a good documentary that discusses debt based monetary policies with fractional reserve lending. As everyone is discussing, it is quite public knowledge and talked about in most econ classes. There is even examples of econ teachers talking about it to students in this documentary.
Its not that its not discussed, its that most people have not bothered to educate themselves on the financial world, and therefore do not understand how it works. When they then do educate themselves, they find out :)
@_date: 2014-11-10 05:31:31
I agree on some points, and disagree on others. The reason that regulatory capture can occur is because there is a central authority who controls the money supply. You can see how this has happened by looking at the first (and only) FED audit that bernie sanders championed. 


These things cannot happen with bitcoin. The FED cannot decide to print more bitcoin. The more you study economics and politics, the more you will realize that regulatory capture has occurred all the way up to the highest level. QE has resulted in a enormous amount of wealth generation for the top bankers. This has most definitely effected inequality and has caused the gap to accelerate faster. Another thing bitcoin fixes...
Bitcoin does not suffer from this problem as there is no central authority to capture. Lobbyists can lobby the bitcoin foundation all they like, TBF does not make decisions. Only majority consensus can change rules, and while one could argue that over time centralized mining is a threat to a democratic consensus, there is not much else from this perspective that I can see.
With regards to the inequality within America, this has happened because of lobbying and transparent senate voting (see James D'Angelo's card board box reform here:  )
Which also cannot occur within bitcoin. The rules within america still stand, and monopolies will still be able to leverage legislators to write bills that favor rules that keep them lavish. But, bitcoin helps upset this balance by providing alternative money supply and wealth generation. And one only has to play by bitcoins rules in the bitcoin network.
We cannot stop the titanic. US is subverted, and unless we can reverse sunshine laws and start getting republicans to not veto down bills like united citizens reform, then the corruption will still be there. But bitcoin can and will help shift the balance, little by little!
And you still get a upvote from me :)

To chime on top of this, Andreas Antonopoulos stated that governing bodies will attempt to regulate bitcoin, will eventually realize they cannot and fail.
This is just the most blaring example of this foresight coming into fruition. Yes, NY can make all these absurd rules and say "you cannot operate with bitcoin unless you do A...B...C...(to the power of 3 trillion)....
But at the end of it, bitcoin is a digital asset that can be transferred out from these extensively regulated exchanges to other exchanges that play by rules that help small businesses instead of stifle their existence.
So by creating this corporate set of rules for NY, so that SecondMarket can come to light, will enable bigger business to enter the game, and we can still get our cake and eat our ice cream too by using off-shore/Non-treaty based exchanges that dont give two shits about NY's laws.

Step 1: Create btc-e account, wait until temporary account status is over (3 days? Cant recall), you will not be able to withdrawal until your account is fully active.  
Step 2: Create new wallet/address not associated with you (use tor, blockchain .onion to create new account), lets call it Address X
Step 3: Using Shared send, send 2 blocks of 50 btc to btc-e deposit address using 10 repetitions.
Step 4: Wait 1 day.
Step 5: Withdrawl 100btc (99.999 after withdrawl tx fee), to Address X
Step 6: Once address shows btc sent to it, click on the tx/hash of the address and then click 'taint analysis' on the page. Copy the address specified as "Address A" (known) to your clipboard, then do ctrl +F (search) in your browser on the taint analysis screen, paste Address A into search bar and see if it shows up on the taint analysis screen.
If it does not show, then there is a 100% severance between Address A and Address X (0% taint) and you may rest easy known that there is zero provable trace linking Address A to Address X.
Sending from X to B at this point would be safe, assuming no link (full privacy) between the addresses. However, understand that if there is provable documentation between you and your friend (emails, chat logs, etc) that good ole 'regular factual evidence' could be used against you to prove that you sent said 500 btc to your friend. As far as the blockchain goes, this set of instructions would be a 100% viable way to severe the link between Address A and Address B.
Yes, this will take at least 5 days as btc-e has a 100btc withdrawl limit per day.
If, upon taint analysis you find a link between A and X, then do another 10 repetition shared send from X back to btc-e, wait one day, withdrawal again (To a NEW address, Address Y), and there should be no taint. If you do find a taint, you'll notice its a very, very very small percentage (0.000xxxx of 1 btc).
As for darkwallet, I have not played with their stealth addresses option yet, but it would definitely be a viable solution once the wallet is stable/functional/public ready. I say public ready because at the moment it is not, its still in alpha stage and any 'tests' you do with it is just that: tests. They are supposed to have a public beta due by the end of this month if I dont recall, with TOR support, linux, etc, so that will be another solution when ready.
Or, as the underpants gnome's would tell you:
Step 1: Steal Underpants
Step 3: Profit

You appear to live in a fantasy world where everything must happen immediately in order for correlation to be causation. Thats not how macro-economics works.

This is actually good news!
TLDR is: 
-Bitcoin more curiosity than threat  
-Perceived as possible positive boom to commerce  
-Illegal usage minimal compared to overall usage (Silk Road vs Overstock)  
-Fed is PRO regulation (duh :)
A more condensed Non-TDLR record:
Meyer's statement:
"Systemically, Bitcoin’s nascency makes it more curiosity than threat. Its greatest near-term hazards are its avoidance of consumer protection measures and illicit use, both of which support increased regulation. Medium- to long-term effects could be more pronounced as the network self-refines and adoption increases…”
Other favorable and interesting attributes mentioned in the Record include:
Bitcoin does not present a threat to economic activity by disrupting traditional channels of commerce; rather, it could serve as a boon.
Illicit applications are rampant but not endemic to Bitcoin; sovereign-issued currencies and other precious goods are similarly used.
And the Fed is pro Bitcoin regulation:
“Regulation is advisable; considerations include protecting consumers, addressing illicit use, and avoiding Balkanization.”
In this regards they recommend, “Regulatory oversight to ensure that exchanges invest in appropriate cyber and other security measures. This includes fully secure storage of Bitcoin wallets.”
The article concludes:
"The Fed’s direct involvement in Bitcoin at a policy level is likely to be triggered by one of two events.  The Fed notes that “Should adoption accelerate, banking could participate increasingly in Bitcoin fund flows, especially as multicurrency accounts proliferate and reputational concerns subside.”  Moreover Bitcoin could develop into a “systemic contagion of instability.” This would make Bitcoin no longer as Chairwoman Yellen put it, “taking place entirely out of the banking system.”

First, it does not 'attempt' to do anything. Bitcoin is based on math and the rules are hardcoded. It HAS [not attempted] removed governmental/central authority from the platform.
Governments can attempt to regulate it all they want, but unless they start participating as full nodes and earn a majority vote, they cannot change anything.
Your reddit SN is quite accurate, as you've miserably failed in understanding bitcoin. The only 'human' aspect of bitcoin is the democratic majority voting mechanism for future additions. One must accept that there are humans in control of nodes. Everything else is just math.

Miners colluding to be bad actors does not change the fact that there is still no trust required to use the network, nor at a protocol level.

The cheapest and best way would probably be to send coins to btc-e, sell them, buy a stable alt coin with all the funds, then sell it, then rebuy btc, withdrawl.
The transfer to btc, exchange coins and back to btc then withdrawl will completely severe the outbound transaction from the inbound transaction.
Since btc-e is unregulated, private, and surely not a part of the NSA then you can be more or less sure that no one will be able to see your inputs or outputs to discern anything.
Of course, if the NSA has btc-e backdoored and they are gathering all transactional information then that wont work either, but I think thats probably a bit extra paranoid without rational cause :)
If you do this right, and time the market right, you can do it without costing *anything*. You can even make up for the fee's by trading the altcoin and selling it at a slightly higher rate than you bought, just be careful not to get stuck as a speculator and 'wait for the next big rally' because your more likely to end up losing money than gaining!
Either way, without bothering to speculate on price a little bit, this process is still going to be much cheaper than the 1-3% that bitcoinfog charges. Seeing that there is a association with bitcoinfog and Agora marketplace, I wouldn't worry much about the NSA being involved :)

So long as you allow the provider to hold your private keys for you, then a attacker will be able to secure the keys to decrypt your email.
I do not think it outside the NSA's talents to hack this mail server (or any mail provider) to secure the keys and decrypt your email should they want to.
When systems have better options then we can start talking about 'NSA Proof' systems, but thats a joke.

No, thats what a intelligent and non-emotional *adult* would ask you for a source instead of accusing you of making shit up.
 I've read the whitepaper in full twice now and no where does it imply that "most people wont be in such sidechains for long", nor has it come up in any discussion I've read (which is a lot)
Infact, the whitepaper seems to imply directly the opposite, see section 160:


in their own time without any of the risks associated with consensus failure. **Then, in the longer
term**, the success of the changes in the sidechain would provide the needed confidence to change
the parent chain, if and when it is deemed necessary to do so."

Except your analogy is poor because you cannot see a trader's decision until he makes the decision. By then its too late to do anything about it because its already occurred.
As a day trader if you see panic selling over a news item you might want to sell if you are fresh on the news and the price has not taken a substantial hit and you feel the news is powerful enough to cause more panic selling, then you might 'oportunize' on the dip.
This is still however POST action. Your analogy is used to dictate a action BEFORE it occurs, not after. 
Which is of course impossible. You are not a psychic, you cannot tell the future, you do not know what news will hit the market today and you sure as hell dont know what each individual trader is going to have for lunch, let alone what their financial decisions will be.

2) Regarding funding Terrorist Activity, why did he not mention that bitcoin is a payment network, and that when they need to buy rocket launchers and Anti-Tank rounds etc, that they need to do it with US Dollars which would need to be gotten through a financial hub (exchange) where regulation exists?

I've had this same thought. That *only* at burningman have I ever felt that anarchistic society would actually work. 
But, my argument is the same argument that applies to hardcore libertarians. These viewpoints, they work, but they only work with 'perfect' sociological conditions. Burningman is really cool, but every year they get bigger, it gets a little bit more shitty. Less people who believe in the culture, more people who just dgaf who end up ruining the experience for others. The more people who are not culturally inclined to follow the spirit, the less likely that this anarchistic society could function.
In a libretarian society, same applies. If everyone was perfect and believed in the cause, then perhaps it would work. But people/society is not perfect, and so we have to have balance in our application in order to account for variances.

The reason I specify exchanging btc for a alt is because you have no way of determining that the btc you receive back from btc-e is not linked. Only someone on the inside of btc-e could answer that for you transparently.

Yes, but you understand this 'insurance' has a economical cost to society yes?
These things like FDIC cost taxpayer money.
So regardless, the cost of 'fixing' the problem is probably MORE expensive than if there was not a solution at all to fix it (and instead the people who's items were stolen absorbed the cost). Think about it, insurance needs to have more funds than it expects to insure to ensure that it can meet equity needs when situations arise, so we are paying for the insurance, plus the premium on top of insurance to make sure the insurance actually can insure, plus we are paying for the regulatory framework, plus we are paying the salaries of all the employee's and owners of these insurance companies and the regulatory 'advisors' and other employee's within the regulatory framework.
So no, you are incorrect, it absolutely DOES give bitcoin credibility for fixing this *problem*.
The economical cost to society for identity theft and fraud is massive. Bitcoin enables this to not occur. Yes, it puts the risk on the consumer, but when did you ever assume that the money in your wallet was *not* your responsibility to secure? Bitcoin was released as a digital equivalent to cash, and you need to call a spade a spade.
From someone who has seen a lot of loved ones in my life suffer identity theft, I have seen firsthand the severe damage it does to their ability to conduct both personal and business transactions that would improve the quality of living. Since they directly hamper the quality of living standards, they directly impact the ability to economically transact, which then effects the economy.
Every victim is a asset to society, a little cog that enables the economy to thrive. When you slowly corrode the gears of society, then the gears dont turn efficiently and the economy suffers. 9.9 million identity thefts a year. Thats 9.9 million people that will not be able to get a home loan, business loans or other extentions of credit. 9.9 million people automatically removed from being able to contribute to the economy in 'normal' ways.
You've got to dig deeper into the cause and effect of stolen identity to truly understand its impact. Its not a black and white situation and your talk of 'reimbursement' is a very very minor thing.

You are either:
A) Very young  
B) Sorely lacking in education on how bitcoin works  
or  
C) A troll trying to piss people off
I suspect its C, because you keep insulting others, when you clearly do not understand the technology in question. Bear in mind that when you are discussing things of technical nature with others, that its best to not assume that you are all-knowing in your godlike abilities, and instead to open yourself up to understanding so that you can perceive the situation better.
Now, considering that you clearly lack knowledge on the topic, I can only try to explain your gaps of knowledge.
You seem to not understand what "securing" the network means. If the network is secure, then it will be secure against 51% attacks where a controller of the majority of the hashing power can gain a majority consensus to (possibly) do malicious acts. With bitcoin, that means theft of btc. Like...ALL of it. Complete control over the network (for that block)
In your scenario, there is "a device and that device automatically going to confirm transactions". Except you are being shortsighted, or perhaps purposefully naive, ignoring both the complexity, and the vast expanse of further inner workings of the process.
Yes, that machine 'confirms transactions', just like my mining rig does. But, if there are only 10 of me supporting the network, then it will only take 11 other people running miners to 51% attack 'the network' and to wreak havoc, destroying the validity of transactions, thereby rendering system obsolete/useless.
There are 100's of millions of dollars spent on *currently operating* mining rigs. The only reason that money was spent was because each person who bought those miners saw a return on the investment (*incentive*), and saw a possibility to make profit. Otherwise, those mining rigs would not be bought, and they would not be running, which would therefore leave a network without any hashing power, and vurnerable to 51% attacks.
In your naive scenario, you think IBM can just 'run a computer' to do transactions, but in order to *secure the network* IBM is going to need to invest *hundreds of millions of dollars* to secure their network, when they could have instead just leveraged the bitcoin blockchain with its current anti-attackable hashpowered network.
Considering the above information, I *obviously DO have a idea what im 'rambling about'*. As for "knowing better than IBM", I do not know the full scope of their plans, but in light of what information has been made public its very speculative (read: not knowable) as to HOW they are going to prevent their system from being attacked.
Considering that you have a very limited knowledge on the subject, I advise you start reading what people are typing, and stop writing insults on the internet. You sound like a petulant child.

Do you always make assumptions on things you've never experienced? Kind of immature to hold a negative opinion on something you clearly know little about.
If you had ever been to burningman, you would understand precisely the *massive* 'public good' they do. Its a humanity experience that will change your viewpoints for the positive on your fellow human beings for life. And that alone is worth any amount of 'money' that tickets can buy. The only way I could try to explain it, is it is similar to how you felt as a small child at a amusement park for the first time, except now you get to enjoy that experience/feeling as *an adult*.
It is *not* a festival. You will pay more money to go to things like 'cochella' for 2-4 days, but burningman will be cheaper and you get a week long experience.
If you can ever work up your courage to dispel your preconditioned assumptions on things you've never experienced, you will come to find it will be one of the greatest adventures you will embark upon for a lifetime.
Also, they do low income tickets for anyone who qualifies, they are like $180 (again, for a week long experience). I've never heard of anyone getting rejected for low income.

You think it is too 'sci-fi conspiracy theory-ish' for the largest economical power in the world to do something that would help retain its financial power?
Look up the Liberty Dollar and the War with Iran for examples of how far our government is willing to go to preserve its financial dominance. 
The answer is clear: Guns, Death and Destruction. With bitcoin they dont even need to do that, all they have to do is harness computing power, and at a FRACTION of the cost compared to war.
Which is more, 2-3 TRILLION dollars, or 100-200 million dollars? A government could easily contract to manufacturer hardware at a quarter of the 'retail' cost of mining equipment. The figures estimated for how much it would cost do not reflect what would occur if the manufacturer itself decided to build the equipment to preform the attack.
Bitcoin is a disruptive technology. Do not under estimate the threat it poses to the financial system as it exists now. Do not underestimate what 'may' be possible in the future. That is as narrow-minded as Andreas dismissing a 51% attack because it does not fit into his bubble of perfect thoughts.

Sucks for the downvotes. You have a valid concern. My original idea was not to use blockchain embedded timestamps, but just to have a camera firmware to sign the file itself making it un-tamperable post picture. This would mean you could prove the picture was taken before a specific time.
But yes, it would require a valid clock, which would also need to be digitally secure. Perhaps if it had communications with a time server that it would only accept times from which has specific certificates/signatures, embedded within a firmware that is signed by the manufacturer, on a camera that would only boot a firmware signed by the manufacturer (like new gen game consoles)

More fear propaganda propelled from unknown and unverified sources to highlight the fears of state over people controlling their own money.
I ask you this Jen Copestake:
When one can "send millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin instantly from the United States, United Kingdom, South Africa, Ghana, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, or wherever else, right to the pockets of the Mujahideen", how can the Mujahideen then convert those 'millions' into USD?
The answer: A exchange.
What is required at a exchange to convert bitcoins to cash?
And here we have the simple outcome: Bitcoin is worthless to terrorists so long as weapons and chemical manufacturers do not accept bitcoin as payment for goods and services.
Once the DoD starts accepting bitcoin, I will be sure to (somehow) convince the Mujahideen to sign right up to purchase all the weapons they need to make war with us (patriotic USA citizens), and it will save our economy MILLIONS of having to spend that money on creating them ourselves and then GIVING it to armed rebel forces to then later attack us with.

Whether they intend a address for single use or not, coinbase has a record of what account that 'one time use' address is tied to. If you (or someone else) donates to that address then coinbase will have a record of that address being attached to the intended account. They control that address and its private/public keys. They dont just delete the keys after they receive some btc to that address. Its all stored permanently. 
I cannot speak for coinbase, but im positive that any amount of coins sent in any different amount of times will be redirected to the account it is intended for.

I find it extremely ironic that he can be so detailed and logical in his assessment of the risks of centralized mining, and then go on to say something as absurd as:
"*Most of this is pure waste as the system could be maintained on a single server."*
How can he be so right, and then completely devoid of sense, in one paragraph? He clearly understands the way mining works, so how could he be so absurdly ~~retarded~~ *ignorant* to suggest the network could be secured by ONE server?
I am also very interested to hear the counter arguments against the centralized mining risks he outlines here. These are the fears we all have, and they seem pretty rational.

There is absolutely no doubt that the security mechanisms behind personal wallets need to be made more 'user friendly'. By that, I mean that shit-eatin grin retard happy Joey needs to be able to have a account that has btc in it that in *no way shape or form* can have the money 'stolen' by malware/viruses/hacking.
This means multiple layer software/hardware solutions. Things like the TREZOR needs to be a *industry standard*. Can you think of the economical impact to personal livelihood of our grandparents if they tried to just use web-based wallets? Their money would be stolen in a flash.
Remember, bitcoin is still in its infancy as a payment network. There is much improvement needed before it can compete with visa/mastercard. The VC's are going bonkers funding companies, building the foundation for precisely these things. In the next year or two im sure we will see heavy competition in the market that will create multiple options and much elevated minimum standards for transacting with btc!

Yes, but you understand this 'insurance' has a economical cost to society yes? 
So regardless, the cost of 'fixing' the problem is probably MORE expensive than if there was not a solution at all to fix it and the consumers absorbed the cost. Think about it, insurance needs to have more funds than it expects to insure to ensure that it can meet equity needs when situations arise, so we are paying for the insurance, plus the premium on top of insurance to make sure the insurance actually can insure, plus we are paying for the regulatory framework, plus we are paying the salaries of all the employee's and owners of these insurance companies.
9.9 million identity thefts a year. Thats 9.9 million people who cannot get home loans, car loans, business loans and other extentions of credit that enable them to transact in our economy. Every identity theft is a stain on a little cog of our society, and if you corrode enough cogs the gears will not turn efficiently. There is a large economical impact to degrading millions of American's abilities to transact.
I have seen the effects first hand. My ex was a identity theft victim, and when it came time to buy a house she got raped on her interest rate. She ended up locking herself into a contract, a victim of this vicious circle, and ended up paying 10's of thousands of dollars more in interest than she should have considering her personal credit history. Instead of being able to buy things, or invest into other things, her capital was all tied up in this predatory home loan all caused by identity theft.
This happens every 2 seconds to a person in America. 9.9 million people a year. And it takes *years* to get your credit fixed. Do you understand how broad and wide that damaging effect is on the overall economy?
THAT is why bitcoin IS a solution to the problem. Bitcoin is the equivalent of digital cash. You need to call a spade a spade. Did you ever *not* feel responsible for the cash sitting in your wallet? Of course not, because *its your cash*. Why would you feel any less responsible for any other forms of assets you have?
Its time for society to stand up as a whole and take responsibility for their own actions. Its time for the taxpayers to stop funneling money into things that are meant to 'protect' us from systems that have been established to be broken. We create this circle. The regulatory framework requires companies to follow KYC rules and other regulatory frameworks, and that allows companies to get 'hacked', which allows our identities to be stolen, which then allows us to be repaid.

If you enter a buy order into the books and you have sufficient funds those orders will execute immediately and cannot 'disappear'. The only possibility in which that would happen is if there is high frequency bots that are predicting orders and removing them on specific conditions, which I do not think we have a issue with.

The whole thing about HFC is you have to be closer to the server in order to front run. Since this is p2p, then that means the attacker has equal advantage (which means no HFC) if he is somehow able to emulate the node, which is a pretty unrealistic observation anyways because do you really think a financial p2p exchange is going to allow for non-trusted nodes? Obviously they would setup entry guard nodes that communicate with the 'order creator' nodes with their own keypair.
Or do you think someone would just make a decentralized financial exchange and allow some retard like yourself to think he just has to 'run a server' to preform HFC on unencrypted data exchanges? UHUH. Makes total sense.

If you process every tx through the blockchain, then you have to pay a fee for every tx. Sure, you can put 0 in for a miner's fee and pray it gets mined, but that could lead to it getting stuck forever :)
With a internal mixer, you create IOU's between your users, and only have to pay a miners fee when the users are withdrawling from your system.
It allows for a fully free and frictionless transfer protocol.
Yes, it is suspected that some exchanges are/have been running a fractional reserve within their own mixing service, creating IOU's for deposits, which in turn creates more btc internally then what they took in.
'Proof of Solvency' is a method in which companies can provide a self audit to the public, proving that they are not running a fractional reserve.

    Bitcoin ATMs still suck balls
    There is still almost no visible progresss on colored coins
    No one uses decentralized markets yet
    Dark Wallet is still dark in that there is not a beta yet
    Exchanges are still stealing peoples money (MintPAL)
    Apple releases Apple Pay, competeting against bitcoin tech
    Paypal has talked the talk, but has barely started inching the walk with subsidary intergration.
    Mt. Gox cartoons are getting boring
    Mining companies still screwing customers
    There is tax guidance. Oh joy, we can now all pay the IRS! Wheeeeeee. No.
    Dogecoin still exists, and is still a joke.

 There is no such thing as "fake pump and dumps". If people want to buy bitcoins, and people want to sell bitcoins, then the price is what it is.
Those price swings are a essential part of determining the price.
To ignore the reality of the way a free market determines the price is ~~nonsense~~ ignorant.
Are tech stocks "fake" prices? How about Tesla? Those same stocks endure the same "fake pump and dump" schemes you refer to above. You are just failing to realize that every single market will always have buyers and sellers, and savvy traders will always try to maximize gains. It is through this process that we come to "the price".

Your not the only one!!!
This is brilliant in its simplicity. Everyone is scared to death of forks, but if we had a bi-annual fork date where all miners could schedule long in advance, this would be great!
Is there a mechanism within the bitcoin protocol to notify nodes of updates? This could go a long way to help migrate software updates globally if we had a stream of fork notifications giving heads up to operators on a regular basis going into a upcoming fork.

So, the courier signs the transaction on delivery? How does that give the payer time to inspect the goods to determine the contract was fulfilled to specifics? Seems that leaves a large loophole for the payee to scam.
And how is this anything that could be 'patented? There's nothing new here. You cannot patent bitcoin's multi-signature technology. Adding a real life variable (courier signs transaction) is not a invention.
Unless im missing something here....?
Seems to me the idea of adding a additional % of $ to the transaction is the best way to avoid problems. Neither party will wish to loose their investment into the transaction.

Of course, your generalization of a answer would never, ever, be considered a 'source', so instead of trying to force your irrational answer down my throat, why dont you just admit you made the shit up incorrectly?
I have no problems understanding demurrage. You apparently do however, as you seem to think demurrage is a 'short term perspective' economic solution. Which it is not. Clearly you do not understand Silvio Gesell's theory of interest.
From the white paper:
creates incentives to increase monetary velocity and lower interest rates, which are considered
by Freicoin advocates and other supporters of Silvio Gesell’s theory of interest[Ges16]) to be
socially beneficial. 
How do you interpret 'socially beneficial' as 'short term' ? Do you think a economy that collapses on itself in a short term is 'socially beneficial'?
Just stop responding with emotion and admit that you do not understand it yourself. We dont need people coming in to ELI5 something when they dont even understand the greater aspects themselves.

I would agree that this says what it says, yet here Mandrik is clearly dealing with a new issue that has not arisen before. They should be providing more clear instructions such as:
1: Start a new wallet (B)
2 Send funds from wallet A (old) to wallet B
3: Give wallet A password to mandrik. No security issue as funds are now gone, secure in your own wallet (hopefully not on bc.i since this whole fiasco). BC.I is claiming new wallets use the 'fixed' RNG, so it theoretically 'should' be ok to start a new wallet but without any information provided, who really knows?
There is *no possible way* for mandrik to verify that each person actually owns the vulnerable keys/addresses in question other than to individually log into each wallet to verify the address exists. 
If you can think of another way, please do tell. Sure, you can send btc to it, but do you really want to do that when others also control the address? Also, bc.i has blocked any tx's from occuring with the vurn addresses in question, so at the moment it would be impossible to send to/from those addresses.
Also, mandrik should be providing pgp key's so that users can securely send passwords instead of through their cleartext support page. The incompetence in which bc.i is handling this situation is monumental.
EDIT -
- How about you get someone at blockchain.info to release a PR statement clarifying BC.i's stance on 'never' asking for passwords? Also why dont you have some PR released that discusses *the fixed RNG* implementation so that people can start to regain confidence in your services? Right now anyone who touches BC.i's wallet should be expecting to have all their btc stolen.

My favorite part, and the one I feel is most valid from a 'general' point of view in understanding the positive impacts of bitcoin:
"Virtual currencies—especially cryptocurrencies—represent the merging of the financial and software industries. Until now, finance has been dominated by a relatively small, exclusive group of elite bankers who earn enormous returns, often through implicit and even explicit taxpayer support in the form of bailouts. Although the software industry has also produced enormous wealth, its dynamics could not be more different. Software is one of the most inclusive fields on Earth: successful firms are started by college dropouts, by people working in their bedrooms,
and by teenagers in the developing world. For the most part, the firms that succeed do so on the merits of their product, not through mastering the political system to secure taxpayer assistance.
Bringing software industry dynamics to finance is good for the state of New York and for the world. If cryptocur rencies are allowed to flourish, we will witness an astounding democratization of one of the most insulated industries in America."
SO good!!

Actually, the concept of the state (in USA) is leaning more towards a decentralized government. In 1776, when America was successful in its revolution, we set up a federal republic, with individual state authorities that oversee territories instead of one ruler overseeing all.
Its hard for American's to understand this, living in society the way we are now with the federal government reaching its grossly large fumbling fingers into everything, but prior to the creation of the IRS and the FED, the federal government had the reasonably authority it was granted, limited spending and a non-overreaching mentality.
Prior to 1929, as you can see in this chart, federal spending was a tiny, tiny flat line that stays consistent going back to the 1700's. There was 0% inflation for 150 years. $1 pretty much got you the same bread, eggs etc from 1776 to 1920.

Bitcoin is a public blockchain. There are several blockchain analytics companies who's job it is to provide data regarding bitcoin addresses and their associations.
Its very easy to determine DNM's address associations. You send coins in, you watch where they go, and then you analyze those addresses to see which other addresses are attached/associated to them. You would be surprised at how much info/history you could pull off sending a single transaction. Now imagine if you sent 500 tx's, or a 1000 tx's....it would become very realistic to map *most* of their known addresses, for the past, and for the future...as you can then monitor 'known' addresses for future transactions.
Clearly coinbase would need to work with such a company in order to fulfill their *legal obligations*. They are nothing more than a bank corporation looking to make bank off the backs of the people, and they will do that by following the rules and making sure they are not fined 700k like Ripple was today.

This video uses a host of analogies and ignores the majority of human history, let alone the massive complexity of the issues surrounding stepping up from feudalism to current day democracy. It also creates this scapegoat of a single entity, *as if* all of these changes throughout history came because of the thought process of a few, and not of the many.
First, the changes that were made, and the advancements that came with them came because of the *good intentions* of those people who sought to better the system. The proof of this is in the facts:
We have less violence, poverty, dictatorships than ever before. We have a much more thoroughly established healthcare system, economic system, democracy etc.
These things may have all the drawbacks that we know, but when comparatively analyzed to the past, they are orders of magnitudes better.
This is the process of human freedom. The slow war of us vs those who bond us into the system. And yes, the video has many good points, but blatantly ignores facts that would be inconvenient to the picture they are attempting to create.

He's saying that the slower each block is confirmed, the less blocks confirmed per day, and therefore the less selling pressure. Less coins minted = less coins sold.
When bitcoin was hot and hashing power was being added liked crazy, we were seeing difficulty jumps DOUBLE in short periods. Avg block confirm time a year ago was 7m due to the excessive hash power added before difficulty could adjust, every single 2 week period. Now that things have tapered, we will see a more even avg of 10m per confirmation, which means a approx 3600 coins per day.
@ 7min confirm time you will see roughly a extra 66 blocks per day, equaling roughly 1.2xxx million of $USD per day entering the market.

I think a fun idea would be to try to get other participants to pitch in $5 or $10 and have a bitcoin lottery where the purpose is to raffle tickets off to the non-bitcoin MIT studens. This would encourage others to get involved and give them a chance to get some btc!
I do not think it should be expensive (say 25 cents a ticket), and there should be 5-10 winners (depending on how many students you can get to chip in btc), that way its spread wider.
Another idea is to chip in with other participants and to create your own contest idea. Think of something you guys enjoy that you would like to see other students participate in, and make it a bitcoin based event, winner take all!

Nothing. This is called abandoning bitcoin and any miner is free to do so at anytime if they feel they can make more money mining another coin.


No, the nodes act as enforcers of rules. They make sure that the miners are complying with consensus rules and not constructing illegitimate blocks.
So long as the miners have a economic incentive to mine, they have to play by the rules. And the nodes make sure those rules are enforced. The nodes are the ones that propagate transactions. Without nodes, miners would not know what transactions to construct in their blocks. Miners *are* nodes.


If miners collude in a fashion that is destructive to bitcoins security, then yes, that is when a proposed algo change would occur. But that is an absolute last resort as it would be a guaranteed chain split that would see the value of btc plummet to near nothing.


Yes/no. Its running a different software implementation that changes consensus rules. But one thing that all bitcoin clones have done is make sure that the software that is being run on that particular clones network is 1:1 in terms of consensus rules, because if you mess with those you risk splitting the chain. 


Yes. And should the vast majority of miners run BU then the HF would activate and those nodes running BU would start to propagate 2MB blocks without rejecting them. But currently, by allowing users to configure the maxblocksize, they are allowing users to make mistakes and end up causing hard forks unintentionally, risking mining profits.


Blocks which are formed without breaking any rules that everyone has agreed upon on the bitcoin network. This has to do with how the block is constructed, where the nonce, the coinbase and how the transactions are structured along with the 1MB blocksize and a few more things.
How do we agree on these rules? By running the software. I run a 0.13.2 node, so im basically a participant on the network who says "you must follow the rules set within 0.13.2 or I will not relay your blocks or transactions"
By running BU 1.0.0 (or whatever version they just released that caused the unintentional HF that costed ver's pool 13.x btc), you are creating configurable options that allows end users to unintentionally fork themselves off the network.
The point of bitcoin was to remove human error and to replace it with cryptographic standards. If you want to allow humans more control, then what is the point? 


Nodes dont have a decision in the process. When nodes are "signaling" their support (by running that particular version), they are merely saying "When it happens, I am ready".
Its up to the 95% of miners to decide to activate SW, or to HF.
I appreciate your interest.

How can you be a bitcoin supporter and not understand the distribution of wealth and its effect on poverty? This very thing we are all supporting is a attempt to readdress the distribution of wealth by creating a fair transparent decentralized currency and payment gateway. Globalization of monopolies undercutting the average worker and independent businesses is 100x more of a cause for poverty than tax evasion. Which, by the way, i dont do. You see, if you knew your history (again) you would know that we have it in our constitution to pay federal taxes only voluntarily. Excises on imports and exports by the feds, combined with state taxes are what accounted for the first 150 years of the funding for our nation prior to the creation of the IRS. I pay my more than fair share of taxes.
You are also ignoring the way the USA was created: As a decentralized government. The fed was a noninvasive government entity up until the IRS started funding its parasitic growth. As a bitcoiner surely you would understand and be against the centralization of our purposefully decentralized government? The IRS is the  the reason that happened.  
Anyways, I dont pretend anything. Im educated and understand that all the items you listed are funded by the *state* not the federal government. You are disillusioned as to who pay's for what and are only showing your ignorance to all. As stated before, I believe in paying taxes (to the state), but not to the federal government.
I told you from the start that I could not discourse in intelligent conversation with you, and this is only made more apparent with your childish remarks and attempts at applying guilt where none is deserved, as I am a overly contributing member of society. I've donated several thousand dollars in the past 30 days to various bitcoin sphere projects and local services within my community. I give more to homeless people than anyone I know.
But you know none of these things and make allegations where none are warranted.
There wont be anymore replies, so enjoy arguing with yourself.

While this is very interesting, I think it avoids the main issue. The outflow of assets to 'offshore' is only a threat to nations if done in excess.
Lets be rational here: Its not the average american citizen who is sending hundreds of millions of dollars to tax havens. Its corporations who are the main contributors.
You can still have a corporation in belize, virgin islands, etc. Having a corporation with a assigned designee to be the main board member without a legal requirement on the countries behalf to disclose the other members within the corporation still allows for assets to exist in these tax havens without having a link to the national citizen in question.
So in short, it does not fix the issue. It only targets individuals, which will not solve the problem.
If the problem must be solved, then we need to further restrict secrecy laws that allow corporations to exist without disclosing the identity of the people who actually own the money.
In short? Business as usual. Screw the individual, empower the rich.

Agreed for the most part. However where bitcoin wins is for the average citizen looking to avoid hyper inflation (Argentina, Venezuela etc)
Just like we saw greece have a positive impact on bitcoin in 2012, maybe we will see it have more today/tomorrow?
There are no guarantee's in life, but when banks, stock markets and monetary policies globally start to contract, then bitcoin will be a sponge and absorb. The hope of it becoming a world reserve is preposterous. As long as it is susceptible to a 51% attack it will never be the large asset we all hope for it to be. And if it does, then we may end up losing all our wealth in a 51% attack when it gets a large enough market cap for a government to attack.

What about Scandinavia? What about Iceland? These are high participation democracies that actually work to the benefit of the public.
The issue here is the same issue everywhere. Uneducated people are exploited and the bigger that faction becomes the more dangerous to society. Bitcoin progressed when we had a single individual making decisions. Whether it would have continued to progress in the right direction is up for debate.
But adding social complexity to it has merely grounded its progress. 
Yet......there are great benefits to Bitcoin being hard to change, so there is both costs and benefits.

Coming to understand how the network works as a entire machine, and not a particular piece. Understanding that nodes validate blocks, thereby holding miners accountable. Understanding that these nodes have a cost, yet are not economically incentivized was probably the biggest part, though in relationship to censorship resistance.
Understanding distributed networks is not easy. Understanding attack vectors even less so. It just took 6+ months of daily reading to wrap my head around the costs and benefits before I really started to go "ahh hah!"....and thats on a single issue! Im even ashamed to admit I spoke to garzik on IRC and encouraged him to continue fighting the fight. Now, I really need to catch him again one day and tell him "I was wrong. You should be building bridges, not burning them".
Most importantly, I was willing to admit that I was wrong. I continue to do this on an almost daily basis as I challenge my entrenched ideologies. 
Its only through challenging your own viewpoints that you can start to evolve towards a more intelligent you. 
The problem is that almost all of this debate (literally 99%) is had amongst users who are entrenched in their ideological stances, as well as their identity networks (their tribes), and are unwilling to challenge their self-perceived identities.
We must get rid of identity (self/ego) and focus on the data.

Network effect and incentive appear to be the main catalyst. It seems to me that software based businesses (ex: Blockchain.info, coinbase etc) are getting involved in the bitcoin space as opposed to the alt coin space because they will likely see a return on their investment. This would be an example of the development lead by VC/for profit entities. 
As for personal contributions towards development, I would say the issue is not so clear? There are over half a thousand alt coins, and though a majority might just be clones with no clear progression of development, there are quite a few that have seen new approaches and developmental efforts, with Ethereum taking the lead.
As for the development of the bitcoin ecosystem, has not most of the development come from developers who are paid through the blockchain foundation (Gavin?). Would you be able to honestly argue that the majority of changes to the bitcoin core have been from non-paid members?
Also, to be clear, are you also saying that you disagree with satoshi's philosophy that allowing altcoin's to flourish will strengthen the crypto community due to new innovation?
Regardless of whether or not that innovation has appeared, can you honestly say it will NOT appear? Looking at projects like Ethereum, can you say they really have offered nothing to the crypto community in terms of progress?
Bear in mind I am extremely lacking in education compared to you, so some of my perspective may well indeed be shortsighted.

When a single individual is in control of 3/4th of all of the hardware supply that maintains the security on bitcoin, and when that individual has publicly expressed discourse against the maintainers of the codebase.....
You have to ask yourself why **you** are not questioning the motives of that person.
I think claiming 100% confirmation that this pool is a proxy of Jihan's is orders of magnitude *less stupid* than thinking there is no association at all.
I'm not going to claim there is definitive proof. I'm sure he's smart enough to create layers in his proxy so as to not provide that proof. He's a savvy businessman I'm sure. He wouldn't have gotten to this point in his business ventures unless he excelled in manufacturing in China, which requires political dexterity. I'm sure the guy has a lot of political connections, actively bribes, etc. He knows this game.
Just because there is no proof that the sun will rise tomorrow is not proof that the sun won't rise tomorrow. We can speculate all we want, but nothing will remove the fact that Jihan has openly supported BU and advocates for it. Are we to simply ignore the fact that he controls the majority of the supply?
Bitcoin only works if miners **do not collude**. You really think Jihan, who controls 3/4th of the hardware supply, is not actively engaged in collusion? When collusion is a primary backbone of the political maneuvering required to be a businessman in china?
I think you are engaging in a false dichotomy.

So its going to kill my battery mining for bitcoins, of which I only get to keep 1/4th of the profits?
Seems to me that a much better idea would be to mass market *wireless routers* to have embedded mining chips. Much faster bandwith, usually hardwired to the modem, giving it low latency, something which is better for mining. It wont take away from the experience of the end user, as they wont realize that a tiny fraction of their bandwidth is being used. Though, with 5g in the gbit spectrum, perhaps their long term plan has much foresight. Wireless routers may be a thing of the past in 10 years.
Ayiiieee. No wonder the market took a plummet today. Clearly this was bearish news. To think that some of the smartest people in the world see this as the future. Well, I suppose if they force the business model on us, it *will* be the future. We will see how the market competes against this. I can see it now: Future handsets, 'bitcoin free' models with 5x the battery life, sold for 25% reduction. All end users flock to this handset, frustrated at the lack of battery life of the 'stupid bitcoin phone'.

That is a odd statement. Decentralization has to do with network design(and obviously implementation), which encompasses both mining and non mining full nodes.

Definitely big, but I think there needs to be some clarification on the FDIC insurance. If you read whats *not* said in their statement, it seems to imply that bitcoin is *not* insured:


All this talk of partnering with a 'FDIC-insured and regulated banking institution' is overstating their position if they are not insuring bitcoin *on a bitcoin exchange*. Granted, this only reinforces the common sense practice of *not storing your bitcoin on a exchange*, but surely they need to be straight forward towards their clients if they are not going to provide insurance on assets held at the exchange.
Maybe the itbit CEO needs to reach out to Marsh insurance, the company that insures BTC deposits at [circle] (

I have demonstrated already in my previous comment that the statement was accurate. If you want to assert that those active developers are "non-trivial" by all means go ahead and do so.
But do not claim that what I said was inaccurate without proof, which you've provided none.

Your understanding of the context of the term "general" is lacking. If it were to mean what you think it means then the term "wholly" "complete" or "entirely" would have been used in the definition and not "general". 
You do not  get to decide what words or definitions mean Luke. You are wrong in this and if it will take consulting with a etymologist to get you to understand your error then I will be happy to track one down for you.

Uhhhhhh. Sure. I think you are talking to the wrong person in the wrong place. We know who pays people to spread propaganda, and his first name is Roger.


Lets talk about aligned incentives and economic viability.
How economically viable was it to waste several 10's of thousands of dollars clogging the mempool and creating blockchain bloat over the past year or so? How much money was recouped in that attempt?
Yet, it happened. It was a complete waste of money, that was only spearheaded due to political or ideological reasons and had the effect of irritating bitcoiners for a short while before the attackers ran out of money.
Yet, it happened. 
How about the original malleability blockchain attack in which [amaclin from bitcointalk]( admitted it was him that was doing it.
How economically feasible was that attack? How much money did he recoup on his investement?
Oh whats that, **none you say**?
You are living in a fantasy world where you think that only rational actors exist. 
The truth is there are irrational actors on both sides of the ideological divide. Clearly there are people with deep pockets *cough roger/jihan* who are willing to throw away money to pursue a ideological driven agenda.
Just like there will be a enormous amount of mining power that will continue to mine core based on ideologies.
What you dont understand is the educated community is in consensus. Its only the fear mongering uneducated folks who think that their position holds water. It doesn't. Those of the educated community know beyond a reasonable doubt who are the more experienced and more rational careholders of bitcoin.
And regardless of what happens you will see a enormous faction of support for core. Yes, even if it means irrationally mining against a economic loss.
Just like all the people on the BU/Big Block side of the debate have been irrationally throwing money into a firepit to pursue a ideological agenda.
So sorry, you rational might seem like it makes sense until you account for **all** the variables. Which includes irrational actors, which absolutely exist and your pretending they dont does not change reality.
And so long as you persist in this ignorance that only rational actors exist, you continue to perpetrate this falsehood that there would not be **motherfucking chaos in a chain split**. There will be, and thinking there wont only shows that you are lacking in your game theory and understanding of larger events.
@_date: 2017-02-20 22:18:52


Im well aware. This still does not take away the fact that in other circumstances a minority chain was retained.
If you think that there is not a strong enough ideological divide to preserve the digital gold aspect of bitcoin to sacrifice confirmation times then you are vastly underestimating the perseverance of those who see bitcoin as a immutable ledger.
You can fork with BU and enjoy your fiatcoin where humans control the day to day.
I will live with slower confirmation times, and if I had mining equipment I would mine on the Core chain at a loss if needed, to protect a investment that I would see as being destroyed by a hostile takeover.
We already see large economic actors acting against the best economical interests of bitcoin, so why would you think there would not be a large minority that would persevere with core ?
You have to flip it both ways if you want to know the truth.

That this drug emporium offered people the ability to *bypass* places like the bronx, in order to receive drugs at a much higher quality of standard with less personal risk?
Here's one example of how this place helped provide safer drug use, this one with [MDMA] (




















Being able to source cleaner drugs by not having to deal with shady people who are constantly cutting drugs on the street, and bypassing that dangerous situation all together seems to me to be a much safer and more responsible direction.
We know that Regan's war on drugs is a dismal failure at a extreme expense to the nation. You cannot win this war, so shouldn't you instead focus on *harm reduction* ? If they *really* cry 'its for the people' then shouldnt they demonstrate it by having positive actions instead of negative ones?

This is no where near prime time. There is an enormous amount of work that needs to be done on it before it could be considered a solution to anything. So dont worry, there is no need to advocate for something which needs years of work on. Engineers are still evaluating the feasibility, working through crypto-magic problems.
The value proposition is increased fungibility (confidential transactions baked into the protocol) and decreased resource needs.
I think the stat was a mimblewimble blockchain would only be 2GB vs the 100+ GB of the current bitcoin blockchain.

Neither is playing politics with technicalities. They wanted a max block size increase and now they are getting it. They can choose to make it effective immediately but are choosing not to. 
What facts did I misconstrue?
If they want a hard fork they are not going to get it. If im a fireman and my neighbor says they want help, and when I go over they say "See this tree up against my house? I want it to be gone. So I need you to set fire to it so that it will be gone"
Now, I could set fire to it and eliminate the obstacle, but its *most probably* going to burn the house down. Just like if core proposed a hard fork, its 100% guaranteed to cause a chain split. If you dont think this, you've not been paying attention for the last 2 years. There are extremists on both sides and just because you are focusing on one does not mean the other does not exist.
There are plenty of miners that will refuse to HF, and when it reaches the threshold and activates we will have a chain split. That situation is 100x worse than what we have today. Arguing over consensus is good. It means  "things keep going". This particular fact is something our founding fathers realized when they were forming the constitution. That arguing over consensus *is a feature, not a bug*.
What instead im suggesting for my neighbor, is that I come over with a saw and chop it down slowly and safely, to make sure that it does not fall over and destroy their house, or anyone else.
You cannot satisfy people's wishes when those wishes come with risks that are greater than the benefits. Thats called insanity. So if miners are upset that they are getting their blocksize increase in a safer soft-fork vs a super risky hardfork...and they are upset? Well fuck that. Thats called peoples shitty ego's getting in the way of progress and I dont care one bit about that.

You are confusing politics with engineering. They have nothing to do with each other. Economics has nothing to do with how fast an engine goes. People might buy the engine if it goes faster but this doesn't make the engine part of an economic model.
Don't confuse Bitcoin development with economics. You were only confusing yourself. This is a highly complex piece of software that requires extensive software engineering from experts. Thinking anything other than that is a demonstration that you don't really understand what's going on. Trying to imply that non-experts should decide the direction of technicalities is absolutely absurd.
The job of developers is to overcome obstacles in the safest manner possible. This is a decentralized system. It does not fit in your preconceived models of businesses and their structures. You have to think about the bigger picture and you have to spend years studying the system to understand all the Dynamics that come into play.

Besides, do you really think their support matters? That it has any effect on this distributed tech? I only see positive technological innovation coming out of blockstream that betters the Bitcoin network by focusing on increasing decentralization, which is the only effective tool against collusion from specialized industry against the public.
When you remove the crazy conspiracy theory talk and focus on the technicalities, your position looks rather irrational.
If you really feel this way you should be fighting tooth and nail to increase censorship resistance, which is the only thing that stands between Bitcoin and power groups. Supporting projects that plausibly increase centralization effects will make what you fear come true.

After reading all of that two things are made glaringly obvious to me.
1- That your argument is logically flawed and merely shifts the blame from the responsible party (person who is irresponsibly accepting 0-conf as payment) to the engineers of the system. It is not the engineers fault that consumers were engaging in unsafe behavior in the first place, so it is thereby only logical to not blame engineers when they design based on optimal safe usage. 
Bitcoin is digital cash. The bearer holds the responsibility to not leave their cash on the table for fear of theft just like the receiver must also check for counterfeit to ensure they are not being ripped off.
If anything, you should be thanking these engineers for creating a feature that not only provides resolutions to problems, *but also forces those who were engaging in irresponsible behavior to stop*.
2- You are clearly so entrenched in your ideological position of "everything core does is bad" that you cannot see the basic logical flaws of your arguments.
No amount of semantics can change the facts or logic here. Please stop spreading this nonsense. You were wrong. Be a man and say it, and be a bigger man by admitting fault and moving forward to fix the misconceptions you have created.

What a heap of statist shit. Completely invalidates all of the promise bitcoin brings, and even seems to encourage extra risk. I've added the concluding comments below.
**VIII. CONCLUDING COMMENTS  
There are genuine policy issues with existing crypto
currencies, including consumer protection and
socially unacceptable activities related to tax evasion   and money laundering. The payment technology
itself, however, could play and important useful role in   the financial system.    
The generic policy issues that need to be addressed are:  
A general ban on any form of use of crypto currencies in  the clearing system between banks and the central bank  
to ensure that the monetary system is not undermined.  
  
Recognition that a trustless transfer and ledger technology is separable from the idea of a crypto
currency and is potentially very useful for future competition in the financial system.  
Some form of agreement for best practice registrat
ion that permits consumer protection, tax and
anti laundering authorities to verify the owner’s identity.  
A level playing field for all players in the financial system is important, so balance sheet reporting and income statements for all networks and other appropriate regulations would be important.  
Some amount of capital should be held by exchanges on the balance sheet (perhaps in the form of legal tender) for fraud and technological failures.
Some form of backing for crypto currencies may be wise
such as gold.
The use of government plenary powers to close down all non complying networks.  
The general aim of policy should be to encourage technologies that improve competition in the
payments system, and to ensure that the use of crypto currencies remove anonymity where money transmission is concerned (to avoid the darker aspects of Bitcoin use) and to meet minimum requirements for consumer protection.**

Well, when all of the technical indicators don't agree, I suppose the best thing you can do is just smoke hopium.
I don't dislike your mentality, I just see it as frustratingly hopeless. While engineers have spent literal years working on projects to scale the network forward, a bunch of kids who have done 1/1000th of the work (that's actually conservative) comes in, makes a sloppy patch that doesn't fix anything, opens up new attack vectors, and yes sure everything will be fine.
Or....It won't be fine. What would most likely happen is a chain split and we would see a majority of the value diminish. And if you don't think the market will abandon it while it's sinking you have not been around long enough to see this happen to other first movers in a market.

By allowing or refusing to propagate blocks. If miners construct a block that breaks consensus then nodes will reject it.
This is why what BU is doing is incredibly dangerous. Allowing end users to custom configure *consensus rules* is a guaranteed splitting of the chain.
Anyone can run any alternative client implementation at any time. There is no danger of spoofing because what matters is that there are in existence nodes that will propagate the consensus forming blocks. You can flood the network with litecoin nodes listening for bitcoin transactions, but it wont do anything because they are configured for different rules. If they tried to propagate a litecoin block on the bitcoin network, the bitcoin nodes would just go "wtf is this? rejected!"


Thank you. Nothing specific. It was a slow gradual understanding of the network that shifted my perspective. Unfortunately it was not just one thing. If you go back into my post history, you can see me arguing for big blocks in that time frame, and then you can see a gradual shift and a eventual flipping of my perspective.
I suppose I could go back through all my posts and research it, but I dont really think it would be a valuable way to spend my time. I didn't know or understand nearly as much then as I do now, so it would just be recapping my ignorance on subjects. My time is better spent countering misinformation with my current knowledge set.

You do realize bitcoin is meant to be a direct global payment system that dis intermediates the traditional financial world, right? We cannot do that if we rely on multinational conglomerate banks to establish monopolies and then use those monopolies to leverage themselves through regulation into a 'king of the mountain' scenario where all good guys have to fight uphill battles just to get a sliver of the pie.
Thats not competition. Thats business as usual. Your idea sucks balls and is not thinking about the marco impact bitcoin could have on the world, stuck in the ideological fantasies of a 1st world country boy.
What about the other 5 billion people? 


Wait, your complaining that this will make *transaction fee's cheaper* ?!!? Am I hearing this right??? My head is going to explode.  Yet in your comments below you state that ASIC's are cheap, and getting cheaper.
Meaning that the threshold to enter the mining game is applicable to moores law, and that ASICs will get more powerful *and* cheaper, enabling hashing power to stay consistently upwards trending, providing security for the network while getting cheaper and cheaper. 
Obviously Gavin, the core developer of bitcoin, understands that block halving rewards exists. His vision is not of a network that operates on zero fee's, its of a network that offers a competitors advantage to the centralized financial systems we are stuck with today. Something we cannot do unless we remain competitive. 
Also, why are people not understanding that the more transactions per block, the more transaction fee's? If bitcoin cannot scale, *IT DIES*. How's your transaction fee's looking when there is no bitcoin? Right.
But when bitcoin scales, and tx's increase, so do tx fee's subsidizing for the lost block rewards in the future.


I dont think gavin took you seriously because you've not thought this through enough, or perhaps have not discussed this enough with smart individuals. They are *not* valid criticisms, though they are worthy of being shot down.

He's using an analogy to counter your analogy since you are too simplistic to talk in real terms. He was referencing the fact that regardless of blocksize limit that it will be used. Whether its dank meme's, bluray movies or your pepe pics, its going to be used because its an incredibly valuable resource. Dont fall victim (I would bet my soul you will do this again in less than 1 hour) to a naive short term viewpoint. Increasing the blocksize for tomorrow does not account for next year, or the year there after. Kicking the can down the road does not resolve the greater issue, it only shifts the burden of cost.
The only thing that restricts dank meme's and bluray videos from being embedded in the blockchain is *cost*.
The question you should be asking is, who should burden that cost? Because right now its *most* node operators who are not economically incentivized (I understand some are, such as business owners but most node owners are altruistic, like me, who do this for ideological reasons [we see the importances of censorship resistence]) to host the blockchain.
Should these [costs become inordinately high then node count will dramatically drop]( and then the thing that makes bitcoin valuable, immutability, will be threatened. Not to mention its node operators that hold miners accountable and a drop in node count alters the ability for nodes to counterbalance power (not often talked about, but still incredibly important).
What you are not thinking about on your silly analogy, is that **someone has to pay for the roads and the buses to operate and operate safely**. You are engaging in a false dichotomy because you are ignoring this cost, and ignoring the impacts of what changing the dynamic of this cost does to the other participants in this network.
By increasing the blocksize without optimizing utxo, signatures, malleability and allowing 2nd layer networks to efficiently and safely cooperate with the main chain, you are merely shifting the cost from the users paying the tx to the node operators.
Considering the node operators are not paid to operate, this is a pretty shallow and short-sighted thing to do, especially considering that once this happens those node operators "go out of business" and then (per your analogy) the roads start to crack, eventually crumble, and then the buses cannot even drive on them without risking the safety of those people on the bus.
Because lets remember what bitcoin is best used for: Censorship resistantant money. 
So for your analogy to be true, you need to understand that this bus is currently driving through el salvador. And there are vicious motherfucking gang's in el salvador. They will pull you off the bus, tell you that you are a part of their gang and that you must go kill so and so, and that if you dont they will kill your entire family. This is exactly what happens in el salvador btw.
But, these  buses are bulletproof and have good door safety mechanisms that prevent the gangs from coming on the bus and stealing the people (people being money). And the only reason this security is kept up right now is because the current cost to maintain the roads and the buses is fairly low, but once you go above a threshold then it becomes too expensive to maintain and then the security of those buses start to disappear, risking the people on the bus from being kidnapped.
 But **someone has to pay for the buses, the safety standards and the roads**, and since there are no tax payers (no miners giving their subsidy to node operators) then who do you think is going to pay for the safety?
There **must** be a cost associated with blockspace because otherwise those who are currently maintaining their nodes are going to get forced off the network due to increasing costs. 
It is the scarcity of the blockspace that prevents it from being bloated with your dick pics. So that people **who actually need to use it** can. Remember....not everyone needs to travel through el salvador. For most, venmo is perfect for their needs. The bitcoin blockchain cannot house everyones venmo transactions, nor does it need to. Why use a massive expensive decentralized system for your venmo when venmo is free? Bitcoin is not going to be the global currency. Its not going to replace venmo. But it can allow for people in really fucked up countries to have safer money. You and I? We probably dont need it, so to have the audacity to bitch about not being able to buy fucking starbucks on-chain is infuriating to me.
Now, fortunately SW allows for 2nd layer networks to operate that will be so cheap that **anyone can get on the bus anytime for just about micropennies**
And it is infuriating to me that wisedick's like yourself constantly ignore this fact. We are on the edge of allowing **Exactly what you and everyone wants** but you want to throw a pouty shit-fit because "its not like the way I imagined it in my mind to be like".
SW allows for the cost to be shifted in a decentralized fashion. It enables 2nd layer networks to efficiently spread the cost of scaling across new competing networks, creating **new markets** for node operators to be economically incentivized.
This **solves the node cost problem** by **creating a node-market**. Thats what LN is! Did you never understand this?!?!

Circle does. 
When you lose a asset that is covered under a policy, does the insurance company attempt to replace the asset? Of course not, they give you *cash value* for it, aka cut a check, and send it to you.
Thats what would happen at Circle if your btc was stolen from their custodial accounts. Marsh insurance would just cut circle a check, and circle would edit some numbers in their system and say 'walam, here's your money back' 
Also, people often fail to understand that money is not actually 'printed out of thin air'. QE is a bond buying program. For every dollar printed, there is a equal value purchased in bonds. Im not saying the process does not have negative effects on our monetary society, just that it technically does not just 'come from nowhere'. Its a misconception spread all too often here and elsewhere.

I dont know Craig Wright personally so I dont dislike his personality. I do heavily detest his *actions* however, which is perfectly reasonable considering he is a white collar criminal who has stole more than 70 million dollars of tax payers money.


Craig Wright is not satoshi for the same reason that you, I or anyone else is not satoshi. Because *we have no proof*. As soon as Craig wright, you, or anyone else in the world can post a message signed with the private key of the genesis block then we will know without any doubt that that person is satoshi.
There is no other form of proof that can exist.


[I didn't]( [I dont]( and I [actively stick up for Gavin](
You're barking up the wrong tree buddy. There's a difference between defending someone's character and defending someone's actions. You are confusing the two and trying to defend a clearly undefendable action. 
Gavin got caught up in a scam. That doesn't make him dishonest or a liar, it makes him naive.
We cannot have a naive person running bitcoin. We have enough attack vectors for a lifetime, and its not a good idea to have a leader who creates more of them by being vulnerable. Development needs to be decentralized with no central point of failure. This doesn't mean Gavin cannot contribute to bitcoin, I really wish he did. I wish he would stop with the whole advocating for alternative clients madness....Gavin and Garzik are now contributing to a compiling problem as opposed to offering relief.
This is also a problem with BU, with no talent contributing to the project and relying on 1-2 people to spearhead the project.
Gavin was a problem. A major problem. He proved that by the whole CW fiasco. He's not fit to be a leader.
He always seemed like a really great guy and I will always stand by that statement.

Thats actually a great idea. Paging Maybe im thinking about features too awesome to implement, but I think it would also be astoundingly awesome if they not only displayed it in sat/byte format, but also included optimal 1 block confirm sat/byte price based on 21 co's fee estimator. That way you can see not only what the fee per byte was, but also how it compared to the market at the time of sending.
The times have changed. There is going to be no activation of SW or BU anytime over the next few months, so the sooner we can start equipping consumers with user friendly tools, the sooner we can educate consumers on what is currently a complex process. Of course the first layer is a wallet with a functional fee estimation built in. And I think blockchain.info does not do this well, I think their fee estimator chooses cheap/slow as default over 1 block confirm. Maybe there is a upside to this though? Maybe if major wallets started choosing 1 block instead of 3-4 blocks as default then it would turn into a highly speculative market where the fee becomes unbounded and starts increasing too quickly?
All very programmatically possible.

The public can often make mistakes via majority rule. This happened here in california where we voted to implement prop 8.
It was overturned by the courts as a illegal law. It was also against the best interests of society.
The public is often not very informed or are entrenched in ideologies that prevent rational thinking. I see bitcoin as no different. Its filled with actors of various education levels and every single actor is susceptible to confirmation bias and entrenchment of idea's.
Whoever wins will will because of majority rule. Which has both costs and benefits. The costs are too great when the majority are not educated enough and the benefits are too great when the majority is educated.
Right now we have a large faction (20% give or take) who are not educated. That is 99% of BU supporters. 1% of the BU supporters are educated. 1% is so entrenched in their ideology that they are ignoring the risks imposed by changing consensus mechanisms to pursuit their already entrenched ideological philsophies of governship.
But make no mistake. The 99% of BU supporters do not even know how bitcoin works. I know, i've talked with 100's of them and its the same story every time. A chalk full of ignorance and incorrect assumptions.
I know that you wont like hearing this and you'll see this as a step backwards, but I have enough experience in communication here to have clearly seen both sides of the story, especially considering that *I was on the other side for quite some time*.

No, no no no **no**. That is such a stupid statement that im unaware how you've existed this long in this community. Developers get to decide what features they add to their software, and users get to decide whether they adopt those changes by running that new version. Users dont have to upgrade and can continue to use older software. In a decentralized network like bitcoin, if the rest of the network moves on from your feature-less software then you will be left alone running it, just like if Blizzard releases a new multiplayer upgrade to warcraft enabling new features, if you want to play with your friends and your friends are running the new version then you will have to upgrade if you want to continue playing. Its the **users** who get to decide whether these features get utilized and if the users decide it then you can cry somewhere else about your flawed ideologies.
There are so many examples of this in my personal life that I cannot even begin to list them all. To sit here and claim that you've never skipped a higher version of a software because you preferred a older version would be a outright lie.
The mere fact that you are trying to spin this off as something other than it obviously is either shows you are intellectually dishonest with yourself and are living in delusion, or you are being paid to spread this nonsense.

Yes, I do. Someone does not understand the limitations of bitcoin and is exposing this ignorance with a straw man argument. Is this really what you guys over at talk about? It's woefully naive.... The most costly bottleneck is ram, not HD space. The [bitfury white paper on blocksize increases]( speculates that a filled 2mb block will take 8gb of ram. If that were true(I don't think it's highly accurate) it would eliminate the majority of nodes overnight. Even with the assumption of less RAM usage, there is still a cost vs performance discussion to be had, one which is never had by BU supporters. You cannot cherry pick costs when having technical discussions.
Regardless of whether SW activates or not, we are going to see large utxo increases over a reasonably short period of time which is going to constrain performance on existing nodes. A HF increase on top of SW is guaranteed to immediately eliminate a large portion of nodes. The nice part about SW is there is a reduction of utxo, so it's actually attempting to optimize that extra blocksize increase that it's giving everyone. Say it with me......"SW is a blocksize increase" .....Now repeat that 100 times.
Don't engage in false dichotomies when having technical discussions, it only riles up those who are unwilling to spend more than 1 minute researching complex things that took me months to understand (more) fully.
I am reminded daily that it is ignorance, not politics, that is the main driver behind the division over SW. Not for all, but for the vast majority.
@_date: 2017-02-07 01:58:00


You are setting up a straw man argument. Considering that its *not* "6%" then why are we discussing that metric? 
If only a small portion of the mining industry is signaling for a BIP that upgrades capacity, then it seems to me that they do not want an upgrade to capacity. They can politicize their reasoning for not activating, but you cannot claim something is essential, and then not advocate for that something. The same goes for BU. If it were that dire, and they were really against SW, then they would signal support for BU. Considering we are no where near activation for either, the only conclusion one can come to at this point is that the upgrades are not needed at this time.
I have a feeling this dynamic will change over the coming 12 months as fee's start to multiply in value and SW metrics from LTC will show the world that politics do not replace real system metrics.


That also applies to pools who are not signaling for SW but SW supporting. Not all feel comfortable putting a label on their foreheads.

Your assumptions of an entirely altruistic network is hopelessly naive.
How did those who have publicly admitted to attacking Bitcoin benefit? They wasted their money for non economic reasons.
If you are not thinking about this you are not thinking hard enough. Bitcoin must be resilient, and in order for it to be that way the engineers have to be exceedingly cautious in making changes that do not introduce cheap and effective attack vectors.
This is not forward thinking. This is like kids playing in the sandbox not ever worrying about what happens tomorrow, so long as the moment is fun.

Great, so we are finally getting rid of politicians? I've seen enough white collar crime to know who does the **most** damage to society. Its not petty drug dealers, its politicians, and banks.
If disintermediating the power structures that create the banking establishment allows my neighbor to buy $500 of weed on the internet and become a small time pot dealer, then yes, im more than willing to see society pay that price. The net benefit to society has an enormous upward potential.
Buying and selling drugs shouldn't even be illegal in the first place.....we do more harm trying to "fix" peoples health problems than we do by just letting humans deal with their own health problems. If we took the money we budget for the War on Drugs and allocated it to education and health improvement projects, we would finally see progress forward on what is an obviously negative aspect of society, drug addiction.

You are not thinking about market competition. Miners who decide to try to game the fee market will quickly find that there are other miners who will gladly package a block with *all* transactions because really, why leave money on the plate?
This is a tragedy of the commons issue. The only resolution to the issue is 100% miner collusion. I dont think thats happening and if anyone wants to provide *proof* otherwise you are welcome and im open ears, but speculation is not proof.
Since 100% miner collusion is not happening, then your point makes no sense. Whatever floor is attempted to have been raised, it will be simply lowered by the next miner who is hungry and see's no point in leaving money on the table.
Remember, it only takes **one** hungry or altruistic miner to get a few blocks here and there to completely screw up this attempt on fixing the fee market price ratio.
Anyone who suggests that there is not a single miner/pool who occasionally gets blocks who's willing to take up all the fee's (given the hypothetical unbounded blockspace context) is not thinking rationally.

All of this is besides the point. The experts have reached consensus that this is the best possible way to scale bitcoin now. Because the public does not adopt it does not mean that it is not the best path forward.
Are you really going to sit here and tell me that the uneducated population knows the best path forward to a complex scaling technicality?
These are software engineers with a lifetime of experience. You think the public knows better than them? This is the problem with a uneducated public within a democracy. In order for democracy to work, the public **has** to be educated. Otherwise its a very inefficient system. The same theory applies to a representative democracy, which is basically what bitcoin is, since the miners are kind of like representatives who have voted themselves into the system with their wallets. Its not a perfect analogy, but it creates some understanding.
Just because someone can blow a few million bucks on miners does not make them automatically educated on software engineering.

This assumption of benevolent actors is *wrong wrong wrong wrong*.

We cannot trust miners. We especially cannot trust Jihan, who controls 3/4ths of all ASIC manufacturing. Does no one remember the whole "They made more money selling shovels than gold miners made mining gold" analogy?
Jihan has a ideological preference that is harmful to bitcoin. Its paved with good intentions because he *thinks* that raising the limit is a good idea.
Jihan is not a software engineer with a life long background in designing distributed networks. His opinion does not matter. Except it does...because he has control of a cartel that has way too much influence over bitcoin.
We must resist the centralization pressures within bitcoin at all costs. The **ONLY** thing that makes bitcoin valuable is its immutability. That is first and foremost the most important feature. Everything else comes after, and if that is ruined then bitcoin loses **ALL** of its value proposition.

That was not my quote and you should not apply it to me.


[At the cost of the operational security and existence of bitcoin](
Without limits there can be no fee market. Without a fee market there can be no long term bitcoin. You know what mitigates spam attacks?
A fee market.
That fee market *is also essential to the health of bitcoin*, so why would we want to get rid of it and weaken security at the same time? Its like you are trying to trade me some shit stained rookie card for my babe ruth.
But, of course you engage in the false dichotomies of every single BU supporter in that you completely ignore the fact that 2nd layer networks eliminate **all** of these problems. They drastically lower the cost of transactions, they allow for orders of magnitude more transactions, they solve the node incentive problem.....all while increasing the blocksize to reduce that same problem you are quoting above.


Except for Linear scaling of sighash operations that SW fixes and BU does not?


I've yet to see you demonstrate *my* flawed logic. Quoting other people who are not me does not demonstrate anything about me.


Right, because humans are totally not stupid and never make mistakes that might cost the public enormous amounts of money. Lets just give them control of consensus mechanisms because they will totally always be compliant and never make mistakes, right? And when the chain splits because of inattention, mistakes, or outright malfeasance, and everyone suffers because of it, then you will sit here and point fingers at those stinking miners, because hey, it was *all their fault*....
OR, we could just not be insane retards and not do stupid shit like allow infallible *humans* to configure consensus mechanisms. The entire idea is so irrationally stupid I dont even know how to dumb this down to make it sensible for discussion.


No, its not. My assumption is a safe upgrade to the blocksize that does not risk the one thing we know for 100% certain to diminish the value of bitcoin, a chain split.
"Playing with fire" does not even begin to explain. Its guaranteed to burn.


Im extremely happy that we agree on one thing. Though I think SW is the safest and most rational way to upgrade the system with literally zero downsides. I've not heard a single rational argument as to why SW would be technically bad for bitcoin. Oh I've heard all the irrational arguments from uneducated sources, and I've heard my fair share of political and ideological discussion from rational educated sources, but I've not heard any reasonable arguments against the technical merits of upgrading the system through SW.
Onboarding more users takes time. If we are to use buses as analogies, LN is like the destination, which is where we all want to be. Once we are there, we can teleport anywhere we want (use LN for instantaneous transactions)....but until we get there, we will have to load up the buses at 1.7x the previous speed (because SW is a block size increase that **does** allow for more users).
So we can either be stuck at the same speed forever, going places on buses with waits getting longer and longer  or the same speed for a premium...or we can do the sensible thing, allow us to get on the buses with **less** waiting time, space for almost 2x the people to transit us to our hyper teleporting network where we can then all travel instaneously cheaply everywhere.
One seems crazy and one makes plain sense.


Im glad you are at least not throwing caution into the wind on this insane idea. 
Aligned incentives ignores irrational actors. You **MUST** stop ignoring this fact. You are assuming everyone will always play nice in the sandbox and thats not only false based on historical context, its false because kids are pretty shitty sometimes and just enjoy throwing fucking sand in other kids faces.

That seems pretty reasonable you know. To actually try to resolve the problem instead of just complaining about it endlessly.
Especially so since it also has Malleability Fixes, Linear scaling of sighash operations (ddos protection), increased P2SH security, Script Versioning, Reduction of UTXO growth and enables a new node-market so that nodes can actually be economically incentivized to maintain the data structures needed to make unlimited near-free transactions.

The only way it can be broken is if trusted individuals from both political spectrums advocate for one side, or come to a compromise.
Since the "compromise" threatens bitcoins security, then it is not really a compromise but a pitch and tarring. Rational engineers will not consent to booby-trapping the project they are both economically incentivized and morally incentivized to protect.
There may be progess after LTC adopts SW and everyone see's that there is no boogey man and that its a technically sound engineering upgrade.

You ignored said facts and instead chose to attack my stance from a different and completely unrelated angle. Investing in myspace has nothing to do with your faulty comparison of tx volume between bitcoin and ETH based on starting dates.

Clearly the most evidence to date that Nick Szabo is indeed the palindrome of their initials. Everyone knows that in every good plot that the evil nemesis's always use anagram's or palindrome's to create their alter ego's.
Im surprised that Leah Goodman didn't pick up this damning evidence in her extensive research and post her story based on this conclusive fact alone!
But, in all honesty people....does anyone really doubt that Nick Szabo is at least *one* of the people behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto? We've had the evidence for years, the writing analysis, the history....but the fact that he changed the date on his blog is actually news to me, and quite surprising in its implications.
Either way, I've always assumed it was him anyways. Why this needs a New York times news story however is beyond me....though I suppose better late to the party than never!

Mining no, not off the top of my head. But there have been plenty of spam attacks, especially before the exchanges patched for malleability. I cannot remember his username, but on bitcointalk he confirmed he was the source of the attacks several times.
He never explained why. Just that he could, so therefore he did.
I think its a really bad idea to assume that miners cannot speculate  downward on the market. Its actually a excellent way to make money. If you can spend a few million on bitcoin miners, and have veto power enough to orchestrate chaos, then you can do some serious damage to the price of bitcoin, short the market and make a few million on top of the few you expended for the mining hardware.
Then you have a few million in miners sitting there making money post-attack, generating revenue until the time comes again that you can repeat.
And thats not even an example of a irrational actor. That a rational actor acting within economic opportunities well within the realm of possibilities.

@_date: 2017-02-10 17:43:17


Would you care to explain who I have chosen to ignore? Kind of a funny statement considering there is no list that I've presented.
Consensus does not mean 100%, it means majority.  For example [A 2013 paper in Environmental Research Letters reviewed 11,944 abstracts of scientific papers matching "global warming" or "global climate change". They found 4,014 which discussed the cause of recent global warming, and of these "97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming".](
97.1% is more than sufficient for expert consensus as its vast majority and general agreement.
Would you care to demonstrate where the majority of experts side with your particular narrative? This should be interesting considering they dont and you know it. Its going to be fun listing all the developers for SW and calculating the % that are anti-SW. BTW, its no more than 3% if you want to just agree and save yourself the trouble. (Its actually closer to 1-2% but I'll give you a extra percent to make you feel better)
I think you dont know what consensus means. Which is not on the surface that surprising to me, I've often found most people who take this side dont really understand the system as a whole, or even some of its more important parts, such as its consensus mechanism. This is not easy stuff and most people are too intellectually lazy to expend the time to understand. Note - I've spent 4 years studying the system and I still feel I am sub-par at understanding the system and find things I didn't know on a daily basis.
Im sure you've got it all figured out though, right?
For you...










@_date: 2017-02-19 20:14:38


The consensus mechanism within bitcoin is a different term than the general term consensus.
I think instead you should study more so that **you** are actually aware of the differences here. Blaming others for your shortcomings only demonstrates your lack of education on the topic.


Because having engineers waste time writing a piece of software that would work against not only their best interests, but the best interests of the public is a totally moral thing right?

Thats even more reason to behave in a responsible manner that kicks as few nodes off the network as possible. Im hoping on the opposite effect, that interest from new bitcoin businesses and other use cases within the ecosystem create more nodes.
 &gt;My main point on this issue though, is that as I understand it, it's not percentage that counts in terms of nodes, rather absolute numbers. And if the increase in users increases such that the absolute number goes up then I see no reason to be concerned.
Yes, that is my *hope* as well, but that hope wont pan out to a reality if we start quadrupling the blocksize without optimization or 2nd layer networks. The bitfury whitepaper speculates that under similar constrained conditions but with just a 2MB blocksize (so near filled) we would see a 8GB RAM requirement for similar services being provided today. A 8GB RAM node requirement is a enormous bottleneck that immediately kicks something like 70 or 80% of nodes off the network based on current metrics.
Now, I dont buy the full 8GB and I think there's room for optimization, but in my speaking to some of the developers they admit that regardless of whether we implement SW or not, we are going to see a substantially increased UTXO set which is a memory hog. So the conditions are changing as volume is growing, and we need to account for that. New research needs to be done based on the data we know today to get some better answers.


Bitcoins "killer app" is censorship resistent money. That feature works at $500 or $1500 or $10. I agree to an extent that a healthy rise in value attracts more investment which develops more usage which creates more users. But its a slow process, and even without crazy bubbles and price hikes we are going to get there regardless.
So if we are going to get there regardless, I see no reason to risk the security of the network so that *we can get there faster*. This is the VC mentality, the "We must return our investment and quickly to appease our board of investors!"....im happy without that mentality. Im happy with the slow safe approach.
Pushing innovation to the 2nd layer is the smartest thing we can do.  Let 2nd layer competing networks absorb the risk. Let them innovate and compete for business.
This whole blockstream conspiracy doesn't make sense to me. They are just a competitor in the market and they dont have any advantage. Besides, they are aiming to monetize enterprise offerings like liquid to make money, LN is a money drain for them. its just a way to bootstrap the network so that it creates a robust healthy environment to develop for, so that in the far future they have a secure safe healthy platform to make enterprise tools to profit off of.


Unfortunately 90% of the time it is. I've been here for years and I've seen the same false assumptions made ad infinitum. So while I suck at controlling my temper, I am a pretty good resource for knowing whats up with the group think mentality. This is like my 10,000th rodeo.

The other part is irrelevant. There is veto power in the minority and this has been exploited for political reasons. But when it goes the other way it will still be there, just for the conservative side instead. Regardless of who holds the position it has major implications.
You cannot ignore those implications and you must analyze cost and effect.
In a HF the cost is enormous and unavoidable.
This ends in a stalemate or SW activating. But I seriously doubt miners will end up causing a HF knowing it will destroy their revenue.

Granted, im a *huge* bitcoin supporter, but this article only highlights the current and potential future problems of both apple pay *and* bitcoin.


Its going to be theoretically easier and easier to steal bitcoins as adoption increases. Yes, there will be new standards/protocols that will address security concerns, but nothing, *nothing* will ever stop bitcoins from being stored centrally in places or individually on peoples computers, making it a much more likely candidate for theft than credit cards in the future.
This does not bode well for bitcoin, and its something that has bothered me for a long time, which made me finally realize why bitcoin will never compete with USD. We need physical hardware security across the entire platform to prevent these things from occurring.

Correct! Which is why I prefer to call these attacks "Obstruction tx's" and *not* "Spam". The sole purpose of the attacker is to obstruct others usage, or possibly sow chaos to cast doubt upon the planning capabilities of Core. If it is the first, then indeed your statement applies, but if it is the latter? Maybe not so much just assholes, but more actors who have a incentive at play.
One thing lacking in your comparison though, is that DDOS attacks on websites can potentially be free (though obviously not risk-free due to legality). Running botnets and issuing a few commands to use others bandwith is not something that is nearly as costly as obstructing the bitcoin network. You can ddos the bitcoin network legally, but not for *free*.

Your entire theory on how to measure decentralization is highly flawed. I know you just want to help by attempting to create a measuring stick, but there's a reason others have not done it before. The reason is because its nearly impossible to measure due to a variety of issues, like sybil attacks etc.

To implement? They need not implement anything, it is already implemented by btc-e and the usage of proxies/tor/mixers. Your technical points are valid, things I've already thought myself, but it does not take away from the fact that in order to operate, they must have a secure platform. I do not doubt that some agencies have attempted (and likely) breached their security. None of which matters in the context of the conversation however, as we are discussing how the article is shit because they ignore facts.
Nothing prevents people from anonymously converting to fiat and back to btc at will, which was the root of this entire discussion. You bring valid points, but all are tangents against the root discussion. This does not come at any cost of security, as logging into btce and converting to fiat without linking a bank account does not identify those using the service for illicit means.

To me this is just another obvious nail in the coffin that China is the worst place to have Bitcoin activity. Yet there is a sweet irony in that because places like China are the ones that need Bitcoin the most. It's just that the market has a lot to learn about censorship prone governments.

I can mostly agree with this statement. However "taking the time to agree" is a rather relevant statement filled with wonderful hopes and wishes. The problem with this approach is that "omg blocks are full I cant send 4 cents to my best friend on the blockchain" gets in the way. Which is why alternative implementations exist. Because we are near capacity so "taking time", while I think is appropriate, does not restrict the community from engaging in fear tactics to shove a political movement down everyone's throats, aka BU, alternative implementations, etc


Thats an outright false statement and you appear educated enough to know it. Are you really trying to stipulate that a chain split is "just as likely" to occur with a SF vs HF?

You really dont think there are irrational actors? After seeing all of the spam attacks? Seeing the 10's of thousands of dollars of BTC wasted, you still conclude there are only rational actors?
Malovent actors absolutely can be rational. Meaning, rationally against bitcoin for their own economic incentives.
What happens when a state authority decides bitcoin is a threat to their nation controlled currency supply? They would rationally attack bitcoin and the economic incentives would be aligned in their favor.
Your entire argument falls apart when you concede that we must plan for these circumstances, because **they will surely occur**.

Privacy is built into our constitution. It does not need to be rationalized or justified, but anything that steps on that privacy DOES.
Its not a matter of me 'getting curtains', its a matter of the state not overstepping its boundaries.
You want to be sheep and let the state lead us into Orwellian society, then by all means keep on being ignorant.
Bitcoin is a democratic asset that allows free trade. It re-enables lost liberties.

You are right, so let me rephrase. I *feel* that theymos bears the lion's share of burden for the division we have today. Im not going to say the division would have never happened, but it would have happened later had we not had a community division occur a few years ago due to the extreme moderation policies.


It was censorship. Im as pro-core pro-SW pro-LN pro-as you can get, and even *I* acknowledge that theymos fucked up and fucked up badly.  But lets not pretend that it was anything other than censorship. He had an agenda, and while that agenda was paved with good intentions (prevent forks, prevent competing clients from gaining traction, prevent division) ...he ended up accelerating the thing he wished to avoid through restricting the free speech of non-core projects. Lets ditch the semantics here, it *was censorship*.
Its no different than the Republicans shutting down Warren on the Jeff Sessions hearing 2 days ago. They could have just let it go on, and the system would have worked through it without too much drama. But instead they chose censorship of her speech, which was quite a clumsy mistake to make considering the national backlash.
Instead of allowing for discussion, they shut her down. What happened?
The discussion was pushed beyond their small platform to the national platform.
theymos is responsible for the same action. He clumsily tried to shut down discussion of alternative clients when instead he should have let the community work through the costs and benefits. All he did was create a faction that was extreme in their passion because they felt emotionally spited by him.
Computer models show that information propagates when only 10% of the population believes something with a cultish passion. By ostracizing those who wished to discuss all options, he created a cultish community.
Since then that cultish community has propagated their cultish fevor and infected some very popular figures within our industry, non-withstanding currently 21% of the total mining hashrate allocated towards BU. Which is *fucking insane*.
I contest that had things been allowed to be worked through, we would be in a much less polarized environment as we are today. The speakings of gavin would have been resolved through community discussion over time, and we would have less support for BU today than we would have had there never been these crazy moderation policies.
If we should fire anyone, we should fire theymos. You want to start patching the community?
Convince theymos to step down. Convince him to hand the reins over to someone who is both well received by the community and an intellectual. There are plenty of bystanders that could take the reins and start patching the community.
Would it be enough? No. But since im going down that road I think a great start to this healing process would be for to release a Blockstream statement with a roadmap for their financials.
There is too much conspiracy theory and the process is tainted by uneducated conspiracy theorists making wild claims about economic activity. Things like SW are rejected solely because they enable things like LN, a Blockstream project. It does not matter that there are other competitors working on the same design. These are not rational thinkers we are discussing.
But if these people could see that the money is intended to be made off Enterprise solutions, and not LN then maybe they might stop fear mongering conspiracy theory shit.
Maybe not. I dont know.
But obviously creating more subs and fracturing the communuity more isnt going to help. If theymos really wanted the best for bitcoin, he would acknowledge his extreme mistakes and step down.
I've spent *years* countering misinformation on this sub thanks to that kid's mistakes. I actually abandoned this sub for a while and posted on for a while when it first happened.
Im a avid proponent of responsible cautious engineering, yet theymos's actions pushed **me** away from here, away from core, and towards that other faction. Now fortunately im a pretty intelligent guy and my rational side took over my emotional side and I came back to reality.
But if he pushed **me** that way, I have little hope for the others less rational than I.

Blockstream will profit off of enterprise software. So it is within their best economic interest to create a strengthened base protocol to build their business off of for future revenue. 
Your reasoning goes like this....
The bridge builders want to sabotage the foundation so that the bridge collapses and they are already paid so they will get more profits building a new bridge so hurrah!
Except that's just plain stupid. The bridge builders who are trying to build bridges around the world expect their reputation to precede them.  If they fuck the foundation up, then no one is going to want them to build bridges in their towns and they will go out of business immediately.
It's important that blockstream help contribute to build a solid immutable resistant blockchain so that their future products can actually be profitable.

I dont disagree with your point, you are theoretically correct in your determination.
But being factually correct does *not make you right*. Its like trump being right about the migrant issues sweeden is having. Sure, he's factually correct on increased crime, sexual assaults, etc....but its a strawman argument because the US is not letting migrants in like Sweeden is.
Just like your argument that "hashpower decides it all" is a strawman that is drawing attention away from the **real issues**. The real issues being that creating mining cartels that have *even more* influence over the consensus mechanism is fucking ludicrous.
The balance of power is already too favorably in the hands of miners due to the centralization of manufacturing (Jihan) which provides undue influence from a single point of control.
Now you want to give these already centralized mining cartels even more power over the rules of bitcoin?

"Satoshi made mention of the fact that the process of mining Bitcoins would become centralized over time as the resources needed would exceed what the average user could dedicate.  It's doubtful that the idea of pools would "scare Satoshi away" when he knew that mining centralization could occur.  Pools were a preferable alternative compared to consolidation of power among just a few large companies that controlled the hashing power directly."

I've edited it to better reflect my thoughts. I wrote it kind of fast so I was not thinking about the implications of being too broad in that statement.  What I meant is that the current attack vector would not be possible unless we were near full by *real* usage. And by current attack vector I mean simply filling up the remaining blockspace with transactions moving coin's around to and fro, with no real purpose other than to obstruct others usage.
I would suggest that the community refrain from using the word "spam" from now on, as that does not really fit the profile of whats going on here. Spam usually has a reasonably narrow purpose, its massive broadcasts of information in the hopes of capturing a few less aware individuals, in order to lure them into some sort of situation that creates a incentive for the spammer.
I think the term, which I've edited to reflect above, should be called "Obstruction tx's" or "obstructionist transactions", because it seems the main motive of the "spammer" is to obstruct others usage of the blockchain.
There are a number of parties that could economically benefit from this type of behavior, such as the miners who plausibly could earn more revenue by accelerating transaction costs due to constrained space, or by developers of alternative implementations who wish to challenge the status quo. The latter may not appear to have a direct *economic* incentive, but I would imagine these developers think bitcoin will suffer massive speculative attacks if the network is congested to the point that we are having difficulties using it, which would then directly impact their investments. This is a rather long-route economic incentive, but one could also speculate that there's a direct incentive for them to absorb market share of users so that their alternative clients will be successful, with many obvious incentives following.

And as a innovator of a disruptive technology, Bill Gates does not see a opportunity for competition in the 'transaction reversal' space? In the future, there will be X,Y,Z companies that will allow safe keeping of coins to ensure that the money is transacted fairly, with multisignature to spread risk.

Lets see if im getting this right....
So if the item to be purchased by the customer is $100, the customer would need to send $100 to a multi-sig address and $100 to a noriskwallet? Im assuming once the transaction is signed the $100 is then returned to the buyer from the noriskwallet, and then $100 is released to the merchant ?
If so, seems very straight forward and un-attackable. Its a luxurious scenario for sure, having to spend double to receive your item, but it at least allows for the transaction to occur with no risk on both parties, which is very important.

I dont think you are grasping the facts.
They are a *unregulated* exchange in a state who's authority does not apply things like KYC laws. If the state had a issue with it, then btc-e would move to a state where they do not have draconian laws that prevent them from opportunizing business.
The business model is *"Anyone is welcome to trade here"* which is what secures the liquidity of the market. If they operated in a state in which they could not allow such business, then they would move to operate in a different locality that does because otherwise a large majority of their customers would not do business with them.
Besides, all they have to do is just NOT follow western policy. Who are they to investigate where the btc comes from? This is a lot more simple than you think it is if you have the right connections and knowledge combined with no legal pressure to follow things like KYC.

Again, im not advocating it, just trying to compare a 51% attack to our current democratic election.
There are costs and benefits to doing it this way for sure. You alienate a large percentile of the userbase but it allows for progress. Should the progress be bad, then the userbase will fire the person/software by voting in a different person/software when needed/office contract run up.
It also allows for a monopoly/consortium to take over the network, which could have drastic negative effects.

This appears to be a *lot* of beating around the bush when the bigger picture is crystal clear.
Do you *really* want to add such complexity to a already-overly-complex system? Simplicity is fundamental to mainstream use. Do you think paypal would have ever got off the ground if they had to jump through 16 different hoops to get a payment through?
If bitcoin cannot *continue to get more and more simple*, then it will fail in the experiment. 
This is resolved very easily by unconstraining the resource. We all know its purposefully constrained. Simply release the pressure and the problem disappears.
As for the *long term* big picture, we have *many, many* years to resolve security. Mining subsidies will continue to secure the network for at least 7 years based on current btc price and mining costs, and that is assuming there is no upward rise in value or technology and that everything remains the same. I dont think anyone of us thinks that btc price will stay the same for 7 years, so if the price doubles or fold further, we will have even longer that the basic reward subsidy will continue to secure the market without trying to *force* users to pay more when there is no need.
I find it ironic that we are willing to kick the bucket on some things, but we are so damn stubborn on others, even when its directly apparent that its negatively effecting the network.
@_date: 2017-02-03 21:53:44


2nd layer competing networks such as LN. They create a new market in which nodes compete for microtransaction fee's, which solves the lack of node incentivization issue that bitcoin faces, enabling scaling to occur at that layer while allowing the 1st layer to be less burdened by increasing resource needs.
This allows for the original network to scale up slower, which is essential for it remaining hardened against attackers. You cannot eliminate a lot of node resources from the network and still expect its most important aspect, immutability, to remain plausibly unassailable. 
All while the economic model of current miners is unaffected because 2nd layer networks still need to settle on the main chain, so the fee pressure will continue to rise.

Those few are deluded. I can think of one CEO in specific who is rampant about it, which is just silly. Its within bitcoiners culture to be anti-establishment, which includes not giving a fuck about what CEO's of banking institutions thinks.
Node count has never been a effective way to demonstrate support or consensus, so im not sure why they made such a large push anyways. And as others have pointed out, all of these amazon nodes will expire at a certain date, and then the node count is just going to crash, and crash *hard*. That's a horrible strategy and the worst type of "strategic" planning that we could desire from a project leader.
This behavior to me demonstrates that the leaders of classic are short term pumpers of their purpose and not long term planners. A long term planner would seek to gain market share of nodes by changing the cognitive map through adding value to the network. 
Thats what core consistently does, year after year. It adds value. I've been pretty vocal against them over the blocksize debate, but im rather moderate because im not blinded by bias. I see the good with the bad, and while the blocksize stagnation has become a epic battle of poisonous nature, the amount of good they've added to society greatly outweighs this one mistake.

This might be a true statement, but it does not correlate the true costs of decentralization, merely provides a ambiguous statement to support your particular narrative.
While decentralization might cost more, the issue at hand is that there is no true way to evaluate that statement with a artificial limit set. The currently limit plays a "better safe than sorry" behavior by artificially bloating the costs.
While some would argue they would rather pay 10x or 100x more to remain decentralized, it avoids the *real* discussion - What is the true cost of decentralization, and how much more bandwidth can the network sustain before that decentralization is crippled?
There has been a reasonable amount of research on the topic and there is consensus that 2mb is a "safe" limit with consideration for network restricted area's (China). Otherwise Core would not be discussing HF'ing to upgrade this limit in 2017. 
I would say planning your global network around a centralized and highly censored area is madness. All of this careful planning to make sure we dont upset china when china is a *major* threat to the distribution of the network seems illogical to me. 
Personally I think we should treat it like cancer, and figure out how to optimize without it. In one bold stroke the dictator of china could shut down a majority of both the hashing and nodes that operate in china. And he can, because he can do whatever the hell he wants, because he's a dictator. 
Where's the logic in planning a decentralized network around such conditions?
Please understand im not advocating the cutoff of china, but instead planning for the worst - that china is going to once again upset the entire economy through legislative or executive actions. We remain so dependant upon china for our network. They have monopolized the entire industry through their fabrication sector and afaik, bitcoin has already failed its mission because of this fact and what decentralization we have is a myth. 
I am reminded that r &gt; g, and its clear that the majority of the r has accumulated in chinese subsidiaries, very unporportional to the growth of the network/economy. I cannot speculate on how we can avoid this, because it *is* a unfortunate fact of life, but its important to bring attention to the issue for discussion. 


You are right, we cannot. Good thing we have this little thing called the block reward subsidy, which will continue to support the network for *at least* another 8 years minimum, assuming *zero* growth on the value of btc. This is quite a misleading statement you've provided trying to convince people that zero fee's means "free" and completely ignoring the economics of block subsidy.

I would have to agree with this statement. This situation is not about whether or not the existence or usage of cash is legal tender that can be exchanged for another good, its about *the cash itself being guilty of a crime*.
That crime? Why merely the suspicion of a DEA agent that it could *possibly* have been used to purchased drugs, because he was headed to *Los Angeles*, therefore "*if the person is traveling from or to a city known as a hot spot for drug activity*" [blanket clause]
I do not think anyone here is going to argue the validity of civil asset forfeiture. Everyone knows its a extreme perversion of the law and it is just our government acting like thugs, legally stealing from citizens.

What I'm trying to nail through your head is that you are using a term that has **both** a common meaning and a defined meaning incorrectly. Trying to ascertain it should be used differently here is absurd and confusing to everyone.  You want to use a word differently than everyone else and claim there are special circumstances? **No**....Use the *right* words instead. Stop using the wrong term.

You are an extremely poor communicator Luke. You cannot deny this, people literally despise you. So why not get rid of your stupid ego and accept facts, especially when those facts help make you into a better communicator.

That is a outright lie. I have been here daily for years and that term has never been commonly used that way. It cannot have since the common meaning means differently.
In order for that term to have been used this way, every single developer would have had to have used it incorrectly every day.
But this is provable. Show me in proposals and code where it is used this way. You can validate your claim. If it's always been used this way then it will be reflected in the research and work.

Its always gradually. There have been a few points in my life where I made sudden shifts on specific things, but they were always very specific things and never big complex networks of understanding. Off the top of my head, once long ago I thought cannabis cured cancer. Then a friend who is a professional scientist took the time to explain to me the data on the subject, and how I made assumption based on conspiratorial thoughts and emotions. That was a big turning point for me in my life because it made me realize that I was kinda crazy and needed to get my shit together.
The important thing to remember is that bitcoin is a very large machine with many parts. You have to understand mostly all of the parts to understand the future and present implications of changing specific parts.
This is why we are here today. Because people are looking at the engine going "well if we upgrade that, we can go faster!" but they are ignoring that the brakes need to be upgraded, the roads need to be upgraded etc etc.
Bitcoin is not just a technical machine with parts, but also a economy. So you cannot just envision the car and how it operates, but you have to think about the entire market. You have to think about the branding, the sponsors, the advertisement and how it bootstraps the economic activity for the cars to even operate on.
People always fall victim to shortsighted arguments, myself included. The only way you can change these viewpoints is by vaccinating these people with knowledge. 
Thats why is doing god's work by attempting to counter misinformation with constant repetitive realization of actual facts.
Unfortunately, its only effective if the entire community does it and does it a lot. Because its mostly people believing others within their "trusted network", and ignoring mostly everyone else.

I would say at this point its semantics, though I concede there is a angle that is worth discussing.
I would counter the point and say that rising fee's is the proof that block space *is* "too" scarce. If block space was not scarce, then there would be no need to pay more to get your tx prioritized. The fact that you *do* need to pay more to get your fee prioritized, means that you are in line fighting to get through the door. 
Its like waiving cash at the bouncer, knowing that the club only holds 100 people at max occupancy. If there are more people lined up than what can fit in the club, then one could reasonably argue that the usage of the club is a scarce resource that others are all competing to get access to.
I think we might just be over-evaluating the usage of the term "*too*" scarce. Thats semantics.
@_date: 2017-02-08 20:40:13
I don't disagree with anything you've written here. None of us are fortune tellers so we cannot see the future. Educated guesses are better than uneducated guesses [and it's not like there is not real research on this topic that specifically goes into the percentages of nodes that get kicked off the network as resources increase](
Beyond that we have examples like the Tor network which has sustained major attacks on its decentralized structure, specifically aimed at defeating it's anonymizing techniques, which I don't see as too dissimilar to attacking bitcoins immutability functions. Not perfect comparisons, yet close enough that we can engage in educated game theory in Bitcoin based on real life occurrences in other decentralized networks.
What's your stance? Pretend these facts don't exist and assume there is no significant impact? I would much prefer to be on the cautious side and plan for the worst than make assumptions on the future impact that underestimates attack surface.
Cautiously critical trumps boisterous risk anyday.


I did not state it as fact and you are misrepresenting my words. "Leads to" is a indicator of likelihood and not a statement of fact. Considering I do not have super powers I cannot sustain a 100% truthful indicator of the future impact, only speculate with as much education as possible on the subject.

If by 'long squeeze', you mean margin calls and possibly cascading dumps, the answer depends upon the entry point and loan rate. People will go long so long as they feel it is profitable, but 20 million in longs that have no more leverage could get caught with their pants down on a large price drop forcing the market downward in extremes. They will add downward pressure upon closing, which is another thought to consider. 20 million of closed longs is a lot of sell pressure.
And I got 5.3 million on 25k x $213 per coin, current market rate.
It would be a nice price jump, but nothing out of this world. Probably back into the 300's at most, so not a gigantic lift.

Back with more retard shit trolling again I see. Nice false dichotomy.
You have elected to ignore the chaos that ensued when the split occurred. Pretending nothing happened is an easy cop-out. But those of us who actually monitored the situation remember of the chaos that ensued and the damaging effects of it.
And again *pretending* that the same chaos would not infect Bitcoin and that it would somehow be less even though Bitcoin is a massively larger Network shows that you are not interested in intellectual honesty. It appears that the only thing you were interested here in this subreddit is trolling and spreading misinformation combined with conspiracy theory.
All you do here is attempt to damage Bitcoin as much as possible and understand we know your bullshit for what it is.

You go to the station, you talk to the superior officer, you explain the situation and demand your property back. If there is no crime then he will authorize the release of it.

It has nothing to do with money. I know, *shocker*, everyone disagree! But really, this obsession of assigning blame in relation to monetary corruption is pretty unlikely considering the people who are working on the project. These are not hedge fund managers and banking CEO's running bitcoin. These are really inspiring, dedicated to a cause and cypher-punk era technologists. 
But you are correct. The narrative is clear. The core developers are being extremely conservative and cautious. This is inherently a good thing and the consensus rules being hard to change by nature is showing that its working as intended.
But if the curtains are on fire, you gotta put them out. Too little too late is how I would view the current compromises. SW is going to work out fine I think. And LN and other layers will hopefully relieve pressure. But I see these things as taking 6+ months for adoption for SW, and 12+ months for LN use cases to be built.
I think LN uptake is going to be incredibly slow. Now that I actually have the idea wrapped up in my mind pretty solid, im having a hard time envisioning rapid use-cases for the technology. Its one of those things that becomes more efficient over time as the hub and spoke model gets more greatly distributed throughout society. You cannot use LN until the person you want to pay through LN actually has a channel. And that type of situation doesn't occur overnight, its going to take *a long time* to build.
To me, this clarity is the reason why core is so dedicated to seeing a fee market develop. 
They understand that there has to be a *strong* economic incentive to use the network. The only way to create that incentive is to hijack the prices to use the current existing network.
And they may have bitcoins best interests at heart while forcasting these theories, but it *greatly pisses me off* that they are doing this. This is not the way I envisioned bitcoin *developers* as working together on. They have clearly stepped into the realm of economic planning committee and are making policy decisions that are having a large impact on the health of the network and its efficiency.
You know what it reminds me of? Its just like NIRP. Just like the call for a ban on cash, the banks understand that NIRP doesn't work so long as there is cash in society that can bypass their regulations. A law is only as effective as it can be enforced, so they have to get rid of the capital flight and cash mechanisms before they can tie down the country and use NIRP effectively.
Its no different than Core making economic policy decisions, constraining the blocksize resource so that it forces people to consider using a alternative network. 
They are essentially firewalling the community, attempting to create barriers of entry from existing infrastructure to redirect our usage in a system that we did not agree upon.
No one's doubting that LN will scale bitcoin (well, at least not most), but the *way* they are attempting to force people onto it is the wrong way about it. I am not running a core node so that I could see core turn into economic planners, making political decisions that have economic impacts. I run core because I think its good code and I want to see the extent of technical abilities expand in area's of privacy, fungibility, security, etc.

For those wondering how the attack actually works, from Abstract -


to electromagnetic and power side-channel attacks. We demonstrate full extraction of ECDSA
secret signing keys from OpenSSL and CoreBitcoin running on iOS devices, and partial key
leakage from OpenSSL running on Android and from iOS’s CommonCrypto. These non-intrusive
attacks use a simple magnetic probe placed in proximity to the device, or a power probe on the
phone’s USB cable. They use a bandwidth of merely a few hundred kHz, and can be performed
cheaply using an audio card and an improvised magnetic probe.
This is a form of [Acoustic Cryptanalysis]( and a recent attack that was very cool (and scary) was extracting RSA keys from the [sound of the cpu](

@_date: 2017-03-05 22:06:10


I think that this is just a lack of understanding on your part. If you have a blockchain.info wallet and you go to spend your coins post- SW activation, your transaction is going to *automatically* be a SW transaction. Or, worst case, you will have to click one button to say "Send as SW compatible" or perhaps there will be a UI feature that you have to enable to send SW transactions from there on.
But when there is a substantial economic incentive to use SW, it will be used by default.
That means that the majority of people will *by default* use SW the moment its activated because the software is already ready to go. That means the moment its activated we will immediately see cost reduction. 


I have no idea and im fascinated to see how it turns out. If you've been here a long time like I have then you will notice the goal post shifting that goes on with every issue. There used to be a *very strong* anti-SW/anti-LN mentality on the side.
You'll notice now thats not the case. Yes, there's still Ver's shills constantly over here trying to argue non-technical merits and getting shut down, but if you read over there you will see heavily upvoted posts at the top of a lot of threads saying that they actually *want* SW and LN now.
These goal post shifts happen slowly, inching across many months.
I think these miners will inch away as well, it will just take time and fee pressure. Or maybe the fee pressure will convince them to keep stalling, but understand that eventually if the fee pressure becomes too high there is always the possibility of users firing the miners by paying fee's directly to SW supporting miners, UASF or by advocating a PoW change (last result).

By not signaling? The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.   Many miners are doing large upgrades that take time. Others are playing a wait and see approach, and some just dont want to put a label on their foreheads.
I think the extremists on both sides have already shown their cards and now its up for the conservative bunch to slowly come to a decision. That decision will be greatly influenced by performance data from SW on LTC, which I have nothing but the utmost confidence will favor SW support.

Greg was doing what should have been done long ago, and if you dont think its neccessary then you have to ask yourself ..... Why is SW not activated?
The obvious answer is because of a political divide. One that was created by theymos and massively expanded by a Streisand effect that was fallout from his decision. No, it was not 100% his fault but he was the biggest part of it and the most major catalyst of the divide.
Without reputable educated people to counter the misinformation, what do you think happens?
That misinformation propagates until there is an equilibrium. That is *not* good for a network like bitcoin that relies on consensus of the userbase to progress forward.
The problem is the system is complex and there are not easy answers. Yet you have a large minority now that claims there are in fact easy answers to complex problems, and there are enough under-educated individuals to carry the torch in this crusade against the engineers who have to engineer complex solutions to complex problems.
This is **not good** for bitcoin because it allows for further erosion of the social web that allows us to upgrade the software.

So because you dont understand it, you assume it does not work? What about engineering space shuttles? Do you think we've never been to space because you dont understand how it works? Do you think the engineers at Rockwell, JPL, Nasa are all confused?


SegWit might help encourage LN but doesn't mean LN can't exist without it and third parties can incorporate offchain payments with onchain settlements today if they wanted to.
OK. So then you are clearly just confused. This is normal. What is your background? Do you have 10-20+ years experience in software engineering? Have you designed any distributed or decentralized systems?
If your answer is "no", then I think that you should listen to the people who actually **do** know the answer. Not speculation, but 100% confirmation.
SW fixes malleability. No assumptions needed. LN needs SW to active in order for channel creation to work, as in the thing that makes lightning work. But hey, dont listen to me, [why dont you listen to the lightning network developer say it](

At 2mb its not a problem. At larger sizes it is. There have been a *ton* of testing and analysis done on the issue and 2mb is going to pose no issues, which is why its essential we upgrade sooner than later, because we all know what happens now when we wait for later.
Are you not following the progress on IBLT's or thin blocks/weak blocks / relay network? The p2p code on bitcoin is in need of major upgrades to help distribution of blocks. There are a lot of people focusing on this, and with a upgrade to 2mb we will have *years* to resolve the issue which I have full faith that it will be taken care of within that time frame.

You are assuming that bitcoin cannot be used as a payment network unless it is *instant*, which the past 6 years have proven undeniably to be a untrue assessment.
Dont you find it at least slightly ironic that bitcoin has been working as a payment network *just fine* for 6 years, but suddenly you have to bring out this rehtoric that its *not a payment system* ?
Clearly the past 6 years have demonstrated that bitcoin can be used as a payment network just fine. And with SW fixing malleability, that means that 0-conf transactions become even less risky which allows for on-chain usage as a payment system.
Let the free market work. Use cases will be built out of necessity, not out of design.  If there is a market for risk-aversion for merchants to accept 0-conf transactions, then *they will come*.
I understand and am vocally supportive of additional layers on top of bitcoin. But I think its a fools errand to presume what bitcoin should be used for, or to try to dictate that to other people. Bitcoin is whatever the people decide it is, and the past 6 years has very very clearly demonstrated that *it absolutely can and will be used as a payment network*.
Your semantics will not change that.

How is that relevant? Blockspace is blockspace.

What you define as "spam" miners have defined as valid transactions, by accepting them, being paid to confirm and order them. 
Im a node operator and im not paid in any way. So the type transactions are irrelevant to me. I would say that its sanctimonious that node operators specifically hold a non-biased position on the "good tx vs bad tx" debate, because with bias it a slippery slope to censorship.

Not core developers. Thats for sure. 


You are partially right. It has more to do with Mike Hearn, Gavin Andresen and BitcoinXT. They started this takeover attempt by attempting to fork the network in the first place. They spearheaded this crusade, which turned into a ideological crusade that created crazy people like you who dont pay attention to facts and love to hear their own emotions do the talking. BU is just the latest rendition of this ideological crusade. There will be more if we dont get SW activated. Once SW is activated and LN is functional then all this drama will be gone because then bitcoin can finally scale without sacrificing its most fundamental properties. But yes, please tell me how Nick Szabo, Rusty Russell and the likes are totally wrong and how you are totally right.

So just because people are saying things, they are valid? When I listen to the crazy people talk about chemtrail conspiracies, I should take them seriously?
There is a basic fundamental principal here often ignored. If you are going to make an accusation, and expect the majority to side with you, *then you better damn well have evidence*.
What evidence do you have that Blockstream has engaged in malfeasance? 
And considering that we are talking about the **CypherPunk**, Adam Back, **the inventor of hashcash** acting as *both* the President *and* the CEO of Blockstream, the burden of proving malfeasance is inordinately high.
Until you can satisfy this requirement, *dont expect anyone to take you seriously*. Lets be frank here. Unless you have a smoking gun proving that Blockstream has a agenda that is hurting bitcoin (which obviously doesn't exist), then you will be ridiculed as a conspiracy theorist. Because that is **exactly what you are**, and as well as anyone else who thinks this way. You (and anyone who thinks this way) are the poison of this society.
Sorry, but im not going to let a loud annoying tinhat minority take control of the network and demand insane changes. You are the minority, not the majority. Thats not how bitcoin works. The entire point of bitcoin is that it removes as much human influence as possible. And BU wants to reintroduce that? The entire premise is idiotic. Literally idiotic not to mention extremely dangerous to the health of the network. That also includes increasing the blocksize without introducing fixes to prevent cpu ddos (Linear scaling of sighash operations ). Which is what "those 25,000" people want. Yea, lets go ahead and put a new engine on this train that goes 3x faster but who cares about whether the brakes will sustain the correct pressure to prevent a crash on a turn??!?!?! We dont need no stinkin safety!


Im going to tell everyone right now. There will not be a compromise on unsafe consensus changes. Ever. Bitcoin will remain at 1MB forever if thats what is needed to be done to prevent a minority from taking control of bitcoin and fucking it up for the rest of the world so that you can make your coffee purchases on chain. You really expect the majority to compromise with a crazy minority? Thats not founded in reality. Thats not how bitcoin works. 
If SW never activates its all good. You will continue to not be able to buy your coffee because fee's will continue to rise. And then you can pout all you want, stomp your feet and make even more conspiratorial allegations that are unfounded. Eventually an advancement will come that everyone can agree upon and we will move forward without the crazy bullshit talk.
You want "emergent consensus"? Great! Go create your own coin that heavily relies upon social constructs, aka FIAT. If the economic majority feels thats the right direction they will go with you. 
Also, nice new account. Care to share your previous account so we can see your stances? Difficult to act like you are a neutral actor in this debate when you are too afraid to post with your normal account. Using neutral words like "they" does not apply when we know that you are merely talking about yourself.

Someone should really get the Cabinet of Japan in touch with the core dev's, because here these guys are thinking that bitcoin can be used as a payment network, but I have it on the authority of many redditors that bitcoin is a settlement only layer and that we can never use bitcoin as a payment network. The last 6 years was merely a fluke they say!
Because, who would think that bitcoin would keep growing exponentially in value and that block reward would provide subsidy for at least 8-12 years? Obviously the security of the network must be built on fee's now, otherwise its in danger of collapsing! Think of the ~~*children*~~ *little satoshi's*!

So sure of the facts are we? How can you be sure when there's no way to provide proof? Do you have correspondence from the SEC? Do you have proof that buttercoin willingly "participated in a scam"?
You are jumping to conclusions like this is some sort of conspiracy theory youtube sensation. You might want to settle down and deal with facts over speculation.
Maybe you should read your own article before articulating? You seem lacking in clear cohesive rationalization skills:


It says right there in the article they did their due dilligence and compliance requirements were met. This means they would not face any legal challenge over someone *purchasing* bitcoin, which is all that Garza did. Thats no different than me or you sending our Id's to a exchange to purchase ANY amount of bitcoin. 


Proof? I see no where mentioned that they 'cashed him out'. In the article you provided he *purchased* bitcoin, not sold it.
Im not going to be like you and childishly through "SORRY YOU ARE WRONG", but it *appears* that the facts that you have so graciously provided only seem to further my stance, not yours.

Correct. Did you listen to James D'angelo on bitcoin uncensored today?
He discusses the issue. And the reality is that non-chinese manufacturers are just not able to keep up with the fab discounts that the chinese have, which gives the chinese a major head start in the monopoly of bitcoin.
Should the dictator of china decide to stomp his foot down fast and hard tomorrow, bitcoin would be fucked. It would recover, but it would take *years* to recover I think. This problem is not just to bitcoin, its to any technology. Look at the cell phone industry, what non-chinese manufacturers do you see in peoples hands? 
Even if you follow  [logic]( that mining centralization will start to ease back because we are starting to see parity on the manufacturing scale globally now that we are at 16nm, it still ignores the cheap cost advantange the chinese have over the world. But hopefully AA is right, and we will see the trend start to reverse a little bit. I can only hope.

Thanks ....you made me *almost* fall on the floor laughing.
This sounds like it was a emotionally frustrating podcast at the beginning, but things smoothed out. I just wanted to say *I get it*, and what you were saying made perfectly clear sense to me. The guys kept trying to offer semantics and ethereal evaluations but if you want to measure something accurately there needs to be a appropriately measured measuring stick.
It seems like they are completely not getting this basic point.
I also did not understand their ignorance on the 51% attack issue. What part of miners switching to the weak chain and 51% attacking it again did they not understand? They seemed to think that was *good* and I cant for the life of me understand why. 
Am I missing something?

As naive as someone who understands risk exposure and would never expose themselves to such reckless behavior?
What you are suggesting, while it *seems* clever, is called "reckless gambling". 
Would *you* gamble with 50-100k of your own money? Thats the resources we are talking about here, at a minimum. If you expect to short the market and actually make money doing it, you got to put up a lot of capital.
Putting up a lot of capital on a bet has the risk exposure of going the wrong way and forcing you into *massive* losses.
I think your mentality of questioning and bringing up the possibilities is a good one, but I have severe doubts that this type of behavior is economically feasible. 
And the proof? It lies in the past few days. Look at the exchange charts. Feb 27th-28th classic nodes got DDOS'd. Feb 28th (late in the evening, PST time) the network attack started. Now, when was there a decrease in price?
Middle of March 2nd. Thats *3 days* where there was *zero* effect on the market despite all of the shenanigans going on. Insanely risky bet for you to put such large sums of money where there was zero effect for days. And there's also no way for us to know that the  430-420 turndown was a result of the ddos. Speculation like this occurs *all the time* and it could have just as easily gone in the opposite direction.
Part of playing the market is being a contrarian at times. It can be extremely profitable to move the market upwards when people are expecting the market to go down, catching speculators in a short squeeze. I've witness this happen *many* times in bitcoin over the past few years.

Allowing LN to flourish would create endless case uses for Bitcoin that currently don't exist. The utility of Bitcoin would increase by orders of magnitude. This would mean much more competition for blocksize onchain, to get LN channels opened and closed. 
Short term a blocksize increase will decrease fees. Short-term SW would do the same. But long term LN would make bitcoin substantially more valuable, and more useful, where a short term HF blocksize increase would accomplish nothing other than to burden the network operators so that the users can pay slightly less. If we are to sacrifice security there damn well better be a high quality trade-off.
I think this proves that Jihan is a idiot. Literally. It shows he has no understanding of bitcoins future potential, and he has limited capacity to see how things like LN will increase his revenue.
Yet he also says he likes LN.

I think this is a valid point. The theoretical question is whether we will get there. Will the mempool even build up to that extent when we have such a enormous backlog? I would think the anti-utilitarian aspect of it would prevent adoption.
I dont think its doing the damage those naysayers predicted, but I think there is definitely a tipping point.


Is it really "routing around them" ? Seems to me that its still allowing them to decide on what they want. Those who want the features the upgrades bring can run the software and allow for others to benefit from those features.
And those who do not wish to have those features do not need them.
You are ignoring the fact that miners are currently holding back the ecosystem. They are preventing users from using features that the economic majority wishes. Developers, businesses and users all want these features.
Why does a segment of miners get to decide for all of the ecosystem? That doesn't seem right either.
Thank you for the paper.

Not that it matters, since he threw a rage quit like a petulant little kid and dissed bitcoin on his exit. But either way, I dont think he's made any public statements since his whiney ragequit for the soon-to-be-defunct R3. BTW you realize you are putting a guy on a pedestal who ragequit bitcoin for a banking consortium? Nice example, totally legit.


Core is a open source project and no one can be forced out. Anyone, including gavin, jeff and mike hearn, can submit pull requests and enter peer review. They are even welcomed to do the peer reviewing! 
But ...but...I thought they were "forced out"!?
There's a difference between being forced out, and specifically choosing to exit. If you want the technical term, this is called "Voice and Exit" in Markets, and they used their voices (at first) and eventually used the Exit strategy. Either way, those are actions which come from self, and there was nothing forced about them. If you are on a dodgeball team and you suddenly decide you want to change the rules and force everyone else to comply, the dodgeball team has the right to decide to not put you in the game if you are not going to play by the rules. Similarily, if you are part of a open source project and try to make major consensus changes to the structure of the project that **the majority are in consensus against** then you can expect your requests for changes to be denied. Thats not being "forced out" thats called "going against the majority rule". Are you really advocating that the minority should be the ones in charge? 


Gone from? Sorry but you've already demonstrated you dont understand the definition of consensus. Are you really trying to argue it was **me** that has changed his opinion? I've been saying the same thing for years. You are going to have a difficult time proving that accusation, especially when you've already demonstrated you dont understand the term yourself.


Blantantly false information and outright lies. Want to prove me wrong? Easy, provide a source. 100% guaranteed it is **you** who misunderstood. Willing to bet any amount of money on it too. Put your money where your mouth is.


A HF with 95% consensus is definitely enough. But we dont have anywhere near that so you are presenting a strawman argument. Your premise is entirely illogical and there's no point in discussing theoretically implausible scenario's. 


95% + ? Yes. Same example as above. There is no lack of consistency here. Again, you clearly are demonstrating you dont know what consensus is. For the 5th time in this conversation now.


The definition of consensus has never changed. You have demonstrated several times in this short message alone that you dont even know wtf consensus is. You are clearly confused and in your confusion you *are trying to blame others for misrepresenting facts*. But how can you represent facts when you dont even know what the definition is?
You gotta come to terms with your lack of understanding. Its **you** who needs to educate himself more, not *"everyone else"*. Tough pill to swallow but everyone's gotta do it from time to time, myself included. At least I know basic definitions....

This is a very intellectually dishonest argument. SW never was intended or marketed as a scaling solution. SW is merely a "bridge" that connects other technologies to bitcoin that *will* allow for further on-chain scaling technological improvements. You are essentially creating a strawman by arguing that "SW cannot fix this" when it was never sold as something that would fix it. Dont create a red herring and distract from the real argument.
If you want to understand what those improvements are in more detail, then you should read this -


No, it doesn't fix it, it allows for the improvements that *can* fix it. 
You are arguing that because it doesn't fix it, that we shouldn't implement it while ignoring that by implementing it we are then given the ability to use its features to add features that **does fix it**.
Its a illogical argument of circular nature.
It reminds me of the DEA saying "Marijuana has no medicinal value" all while refusing to change its classification status to a level that can allow for medical research.
Without the classification change (SW), research (mast/schnorr/etc) cannot be done and the DEA(BU) can continue to assert its position. Advocating against SW is advocating for the DEA to keep cannabis classified the way it is so that scientific research can never be done (other on-chain scaling improvements can never be implemented).

@_date: 2016-03-07 18:30:37


I understand what you are trying to say, but its not totally true. Perhaps a more true statement would be....
*Bitcoin, through additional protocol layer enhancements (pegging, sidechains), can separate its asset (BTC) from its system (Bitcoin/Blockchain), but by default a transaction is settled instantly within the system by combining the properties of both the currency/system when used directly on the default parent/master chain (Blockchain).*
Now, with all the technical jargon aside, this definition *does not* take away from the point of the OP. Bitcoin has clearly been used as a currency these past 6 years. Whether you want to acknowledge this fact, or ignore it is up to you, but walking blind helps no one, especially not yourself.
I understand that the network needs to be secured. Fortunately, we have a enormous subsidy that is going to secure the network *at the very least for the next 5 years* and economic planning actions that firewalls users and use cases from the network *before* we've even had a chance to establish additional layers like  Lightning and improvements like SegWit is a very clear shortsightedness of our central planners.
No one likes a bully, and I think its really clear that the developers have bullied the users at this point. They've put their foot down and said "You cannot use bitcoin the way you want because we dont approve and you must use these non-existent services instead"
The biggest mistake here is simply allowing the constraining of resources before we have these additional systems to take the load off. And *no one* can claim they were unaware of the situation.

If you think miners/end users/consumers dont respond to the market based on psychological or social perception, you've not paid attention to bitcoin.
Pools hashrates were completely changed when fears among the community spread when pools were nearing 50% of the hashrate. Changes were made, pools were abandoned. This is proof of social intervention based on psychological fears. It was a market response.
I dont think this is as severe, but I do not think it is trivial either. Miner collusion on manipulating fee's is something to worry about. Whether there will be a market response to it is unknown. I think that there will be, should we discover its rampant.
Assumptions aside, show me the data if you have it, otherwise this is a philosophical conversation.

You cannot have a massive decentralized and lighting quick system on-chain.

They are testing the waters. Its a great sign, but perhaps not the bull sign you speak of.

This might seem like a valid argument to those who are non-technical, but to the people who [can read basic readme's from the release notes]( we can see that the mempool is *infact not limited but merely has a default limiting set to 300mb*. 
Seriously, do you think you can't change a default setting to optimize your benefit to the network? Do you really think that the 64GB blade servers are keeping their mempool limit to 300mb?

If he was a vendor, then logic would imply that he was doing *no purchasing at all*, but instead depositing btc and selling for cash. It would seem that they would have reported him for suspicious activity likely because he was transferring directly from DNM's to his coinbase account.

First off, Love what you do Meni and I've always enjoyed reading your writings. You are a respected thought leader in this space.


While you may be technically correct that by acting in the best interest for others you are thereby increasing utility, it does not represent "self-interest" which is what bitcoin mining is typically based upon.
This is a complex subject, so forgive me if im not so clear.
Basically we can expect miners to behave rationally in terms of self-interest, but we should never expect miners to behave rationally in altruistic ways. 
One would think that Miners would want to see bitcoin thrive for all, because the thriving of bitcoin for all means a increase of value of BTC, which leads to higher profits.
But this is expecting rational thinking and clearly miners (even if a culturally centralized cabal ran mostly by one person) have not exhibited rational thinking in this scenario. This is also clearly due to cultural or ideological implications, and a lack of research into the subject. 
I do agree with JohnyQ1980's statement (but definitely not with his insulting tone) that you are introducing moral arguments in a moral-agnostic system. While we can most definitely capitalize upon these immoral actions and advocate for a "social response" by the users (businesses, end users, developers) against these actions, we cannot really claim that its "against game theory".
Game theory must expect irrational actors. Unfortunately, its proving that the miners are willing to be irrational to the point of suicide. This is a sad situation, because in their suicide, they will end up crushing the value of bitcoin, lowering profit margins for honest miners, and then decreasing the security of the network when a large percentage of hashrate falls off.
Game theory would account for irrational actors attacking the minority chain because these actors are actually acting within their self-perceived rational self-interest. They see the other side as attempting to destroy the value of their work, and so they attack it as a defensive move.
I think that this explains how a irrational actor can be confused on what his self interest is, and irrationally attack someone else, while still believing he is behaving in a rational self interest.
Game theory has to account for these actions, and I dont think its outside of game theory at all to take in these interplays. I also dont think that morality has any objectivity in determining rational outcomes.

But these services will once again wish to use Bitcoin when the drama has burned it's candle and the improvements are pushed through.
The blame sits solely on the shoulders of every single individual that has advocated for blocking the current upgrades.
The logic of blaming the people who offered the upgrades when it is you or your faction who blocked those upgrades is beyond me.
This is the typical thinking that Core runs Bitcoin. They do not. They provide software and it's up to us to decide to run it. Those who decided to not run the software and block the upgrades ......You don't have the right to bitch and complain about the results of your obstructions.

I find that very strange, because they do seem like very bright individuals, and surely they understand that if someone has the hashpower, that no matter what the network decides they could preform the same attack on any chain with the same algo.
They seemed to think that it would be ok to continue mining on the 'new' chain that the attackers created, but nothing stops those attackers from continuing to secretly mine the forked chain (minority chain) and to re-broadcast a longer chain at some point in the future, re-attacking the minority chain with the same mechanism.
@_date: 2016-03-05 17:33:59
Scarcity (constrained blockspace) is a requirement for this attack vector. If blocks were not near-full then ~~spam~~ *obstruction tx's* would not be ~~possible~~ *cheap and effective*, so im unsure of the logic going on here.
Nick is a brilliant polymath, but I cant help feel that he's missing a essential point here. Obviously the blocks are not 100% full right now, because we can see pre-attack and post-attack that block sizes were not all 1mb (throwing the few empty block outliers out and averaging), but being so close to full it makes this attack vector cheap and effective.
But that does not mean that block space is *not* scarce. Its obviously in the 80-90% full range as we can see from normal historical transaction data over the past few months.
So why would he argue against the data? Clearly block space *is* scarce, otherwise the attack vector would not be ~~possible~~ *cheap and effective*.
So whats going on? Is there a ulterior motive here? This mans mind is far greater than mine and I cannot fathom he is mis-understanding the data.

Its explained in the title. tx's are waiting to be included in blocks, the fuller the blocks the more left behind, the larger the mempool becomes. This will continue until demand for blockspace out prices a percentage of users.
Short term this leads to fuller blocks, but eventually the blockspace will become less constrained as fee's become higher.
Pricing out use cases for bitcoin at such a early stage to me is pure foolishness. We have roughly 7 years of block subsidies that pay for mining security at *the current value of btc*. This is assuming the price stays the same for the next 7 years, which I imagine most people would not believe will happen which only argues that we will have block subsidies for much longer than 7 years paying for security.
This entire philosophy of "if we dont build the fee market now, people wont pay for fee's in the future" I think is not founded in any reasonable logic, considering the time frames involved.
We should really be having this discussion 3-4 years from now, and blockspace should not be artificially constrained and the market should be allowed to determine its own equilibrium.

Im a supporter of raising the blocksize, but a vehemently opposite this type of toxic accusation.
The developers at blockstream all signed a contract that puts their obligations towards *bitcoin first, blockstream second*. Not to mention its run by one of the most respected cypher punks, who is on record for *decades* of being anti-establishment.
This entire debate has nothing to do with blockstream, but everything to do with peoples particular vision. Every single developer who wants to keep the blocksize small wants it for valid reasons, though I disagree with their philosophy to a extent. 
Slinging toxic mud in their faces can only damage our community, so im asking very kindly...
Please stop.
And just so you are aware, blockstream *wants* large blocksizes for LN. The optimum blocksize for maximum capacity, as described in the HK scaling conference slideshow, *was 32mb*. So not only are you acting with a toxic behavior, but you are also just plain wrong.

We are discussing a consensus rule. The 1mb limit is itself *a consensus rule*. Its simple...if you can craft a block breaking that rule and it causes a fork, then *you are breaking a consensus rule*. All you are doing is demonstrating that you dont understand even the most basic bitcoin facts.
Dont get confused about such simple facts and dont try to confuse others with your ignorance.


Yes, thats right. Im going to follow the most capable engineers on a project. When its time to buy a new car are you going to go to the company that has 100 active engineers on design, safety, performance, etc, with many many lifetimes of experience combined in automative engineering? Or are you going to go to "Tom Z's Auto" where they have no past work posted, no resources, no public testing, no peer review.....
Its pretty obvious which is a reasonable action and which is stupid. Also, satoshi doesn't exist anymore. So yes, im going with core and not satoshi. Satoshi showed his design to be imperfect.

You do realize the amount of btc has nothing to do with it, right?




Those are the metrics that matter. Blockspace is a resource that is constrained, so it has to do with the size of the transaction, not the size of btc. 6 btc or 6000 btc, all that matters is the amount of inputs/outputs and signatures associated with them, which correlates transaction size.
.00013 is a excellent fee for 381 bytes, which is a only slightly larger than normal transaction size (I would say 260 bytes is pretty normal-ish for P2PKH).

Yes, you could still specifically choose to not opt-in to SW even though your software supports it. You *could* move your p2pkh funds to another p2pkh address. *Why* you would do so, when SW is going to cost less is the real question.
You have the option to pay less and to get higher security (malleability protection) by moving your p2pkh funds to a SW compatible address.
Why would you choose to not do that? Why would everyone choose to not do that? Maybe you (or a theoretical person in this situation) want to hold onto some retarded ideological perspective, but im pretty sure that everyone else is going to pay less if they can. Isn't that what everyone is complaining about? "Fee's are too high!" .....well the solution is already developed. Its ready to go.


With time and data like everything else. We've had 2 other soft forks that activated with 95% threshhold, and SW will *eventually* activate, though it will take much longer than expected.
Fee's will get so outrageously out of hand that eventually an equilibrium of social pressure will be met and enough miners will switch. This combined with data from LTC SW operation will eventually sway enough miners to signal and its a snowball from there.
The other plausible way is if miners specifically choose to attack other miners when SW gets 51% of the hashrate. I dont think thats a great way to do it, but I also think that miners who are not signaling SW are obstructing the progression of bitcoin, and that miners need to serve their economic interests. If other miners are stonewalling their economic interests, then I dont see it as entirely irrational for miners to attack other miners. Note that im not saying that its a ethical act, merely a economically rational act.

They would the moment someone who is not building upon the invalid chain finds a block and propagates it. The miner, by crafting a invalid block would fork himself off the main chain. They would absolutely lose their reward. You cannot sell coins until a x amount of blocks, so the chances of the entire community building on that invalid chain until there are x amount of blocks (I think it was 100?) is slim to none.

LOL @ "suppose"
Its running, right now, and has been for 8 years. You must be *really* confused on how bitcoin works if you are struggling with this fundamental basic point.
If bitcoin does not fork, then whatever is the majority chain is the consensus rules-binding chain, aka bitcoin.
Any chain that tries to fork away from those consensus rules is the non-consensus minority chain *until it becomes a majority chain*. Once it becomes a majority chain (meaning, once the chain has been accepted by ALL people, including users, miners, industry, etc), then whatever consensus changing rules went into effect is the new consensus ruleset that the majority chain is based on. It becomes bitcoin.


Huh? Bitcoins consensus mechanism doesn't give two fucks what I think. It plods along with all the users of the network supporting it until a majority of users decide to change those rules. See above.


I dont get to define these terms and neither do you. There is no goalpost shifting possible. Bitcoin determines its own consensus rules by continuing to run on its current rule set.
Seriously....you're not struggling with this are you? Because this is elementary to bitcoin. If you struggle with this basic shit then its no wonder you fail with so much other basic shit.

If you cannot do better then that, then do not respond to this comment. I dont have time for children or crazy fucks with mood swings.


Show me where I advocated for "unthinking respect". I of course did not and you are making broad assumptions on things that I have already disproved with my response above. If you are not going to bother to read what I write, then please do not respond. I've treated you too kindly so far and you are proving I should not have bothered.


You are confusing anonymity with reputation. A person can have both, as satoshi does. So I find it slightly ironic that you just used satoshi as an example when it proves my point. Having a reputation is incredibly important to the review process.
Otherwise how can we trust the reviewers to review? Should I trust your grandma, who's never turned on a computer, to review the latest tumblebit implementation? 
The truth is you seem to be very confused here. You seem to not understand are purposefully diverting from the issue at hand. Peer review is essential to quality engineering.
Do you think NASA sends American's to space without extensive peer review?
Do you think Tesla puts out new cars on the market without extensive peer review?
Do you think these people let people who they dont even know, and therefore could have no trust for, to review their highly academic information?
Reputations must exist in order to build trust for peer review. Without it, peer review is non-functional. You dont seem to understand what peer review is, or you seem to have not thought this out at all. 
You can be anonymous and peer review, but your pseudonym must have built credibility in an industry first by demonstrating they have the accumen to objectively review. Otherwise their review means nothing.
Now, please either respond like a grown up and point out any fallacies or misrepresentations of my argument, or do not respond at all. But understand that if you are attacking the peer review process, that is 100% anti-intellectualism. Whoever spreads that illogical gospel should be treated like the enemy and if thats you then thats you. But dont try to pretend that you are not spreading anti-intellectualism. You cannot make a intellectual argument against peer-review.

No. HF 2mb increase plus SW = 8mb blocksize potential.
Even the big blockers data showed negative effects after 4mb, specifically in China.
If you are going to make a case you need to get the numbers right. SW out the door has the potential for 4mb.
So just go with SW since those are the numbers you want. This "I want it my way and to hell with the risks" attitude is really dangerous.

You cannot ignore these facts and pretend like there are not solutions sitting on the table waiting for miners to activate a much needed upgrade.
*Thats* how bitcoin is going to work as a currency. And if people like you started working *for* bitcoin instead of *against* it, maybe we would get there sooner. The longer you fight it, the longer you delay the much needed upgrade of both capacity and bandwidth.

BU has a limit on its blocksize, despite the "unlimited" in its name. So it also "restricts" the blockspace. That includes Classsic, XT and core.
Essentially you are saying bitcoin needs to fork to ...get rid of everyone? Because there is not a single client that does not restrict blockspace.
Just like there is not a single client that is trying to restrict blockspace to 1MB. You've conveniently forgotten about the fact that core has a pending block size upgrade.
PhD eh? Suuuuuuure. Whatever you say "Doctor" ......Doctor LOL!
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:08:22


If you want less fee's then you should advocate to activate the currently pending blocksize increase. 
You want engineers to compromise security so it can appease political postions? That doesn't make sense.
There is literally not a single valid reason to block SW vs a 2MB HF, and there are a dozen reasons to not do a 2MB HF and to instead activate SW.
SW *is* the compromise. In fact, its much more than a compromise, its a entire raft of protocol improvements that make bitcoins utility much greater. To advocate against it is pure madness.
We are dealing with petulant children who are behaving like "Its my way or the highway", when they dont even have any valid reasons to go their way.
Core has a 100 valid reasons to go their way, based on empirical data, research and quality engineering.
You dont realize that as a end user what you want is the best bitcoin? The best bitcoin would be a bitcoin with the current pending and much needed improvement activated. So that you, a end user, can immediately enjoy lower fee's.
Not only will you enjoy lower fee's, but *how about 0 conf transactions* at near-free cost?
Doesn't that sound great?
There should never be a compromise of security for politics. Instead, you should listen to the experts who have reached consensus on the issue and ignore the non-experts.

*Expecting others to "honor" their part of the agreement when you (maybe not you specifically, but a large % of miners) have dishonored the agreement is not a rational conclusion.*
*Are miners special? Do they get to shit on some parts of the agreement because they are special, while others have to follow every line exactly?*
*If you feel burned, maybe you should be angry at your fellow miners who broke the agreement and burned it for everyone.*

I heard joe rogan clarify that term on one of his podcasts. Supposedly it was really a encumbersome woman, one who is so difficult that its a burden to carry her around, similar to the uncomfortable burden of carrying a pile of sticks. Think offset load everywhere, sticks slipping out of your grasp and teetering one way, etc.
So the original term had everything to do with a burdensome woman, and nothing to do with cigarettes, sticks or gay men.
You can also see why the term would be used to apply to a gay man. Gay men are notoriously flamboyant and emotional, similar to a faggot, aka a burdensome woman.
Thats no dig to gay dudes, I have plenty of gay friends and they all admit they are mostly drama queens. 
EDIT - Just looked up the wiki on it. Pretty spot on
[The word faggot has been used in English since the late 16th century as an abusive term for women, particularly old women,[9] and reference to homosexuality may derive from this,[8][10] as female terms are often used with reference to homosexual or effeminate men (cf. nancy, sissy, queen). The application of the term to old women is possibly a shortening of the term "faggot-gatherer", applied in the 19th century to people, especially older widows, who made a meagre living by gathering and selling firewood.[10] It may also derive from the sense of "something awkward to be carried" (compare the use of the word baggage as a pejorative term for old people in general).[8]](

First, let me just say this. I absolutely refute any tinhat conspiracy theories that this is a "large actor". [When you analyze the basic facts and timetables, it becomes very clear who the attackers plausibly are](
This is the same issue we had before. Dont you guys remember that it was merely [amaclin]( from bitcoin talk who was attacking bitcoin before, several times?
One person. One single guy. Not large actors.
With blocks near-full on a regular basis its *very cheap* to fill the rest of the block. Cheap enough that some bitcoin developers or early investors who have a few btc to spare out of their horde could easily accomplish the current attack on the network.
Yet if the limit was 2mb, it would cost 10-20x more than they are currently spending. If at peak times we are getting 80-90% full, it would only take 400-800 258 byte transactions to fill it. At 0.00005 fee, which is probably enough to clog the network considering that was a standard fee being used over the last several months, that would only cost $16 per block, which comes out to $2,304 per day for 144 blocks. This is assuming you need to fill 0.2MB...if only 0.1MB is needed it costs half as much. Thats something that any individual could "waste" to prove a point. Especially if that point tipped the scales into their favor if they were a competitor. I "wasted" more than that in the past 2 months by donating to bernie sanders. If im willing to throw my money away at a candidate who will probably lose, its easy enough to rationalize losing a few btc to gain a advantage in a market.
I hope my math was right on that. Thats assuming you even need a .00005 fee to clog the network, which you could probably get away with even .00002 and still serve the same purpose.


It would be no cheaper at 2mb then it would at 1mb. If we are at 50-60% blocks full at 1mb then there is no valid economical reason for the tx's to be anymore expensive at 2mb. 
Either the blockspace is constrained and fee's are higher, or it is not and they are what they have been for the past few months. Only the constraining of a artificial limit will increase fee's without any other forces at play. Whether the block is 60% or 30% full, fee's will be the same.

The market wont regulate itself. We will agree that the SEC is a bureaucratic organization that does a lot of harm, but it will be hard to argue that they dont do much needed regulatory structuring for the net benefit of society.

I was googling the other day and realized that there is academic research on the subject.
To anyone who denies that the existence of spam attacks on the network, you should really read [this research paper on the subject]( which states.....


against Bitcoin. Using our clustering based approach we find that 385,256
(23.41%) out of 1,645,667 total Bitcoin transactions were spam during a 10 day
period at the peak of the spam campaign. We also show that this attack had
a negative impact on non-spam transactions, increasing average fees by 51%
(from 45 to 68 Satoshis/byte) and processing delay by 7 times (from 0.33 to 2.67
hours). This shows that an adversary who is willing to expand modest amounts
of bitcoin (at least $49,000 USD), to pay higher fees, can DoS Bitcoin. Follow up
DoS attacks against Bitcoin have used other methods, such as “money drops”,
and transaction malleability to degrade the operation of Bitcoin. We point out
that changes to Bitcoin’s minimum fees could mitigate some of the spam motifs
we witnessed. Our results show that exploration into Bitcoin transaction spam
filtering techniques, and other Bitcoin DoS mitigation approaches, merit further

Im not sure that I agree. Reputation has an incredibly valid weight metric when it comes to scientific peer review. While this may have some cost, the benefit far outweighs the cost. Peer review is not a lie detector, its a pragmatic approach to reviewing for error. 
Now, that is not to say that things should not stand on the merit of their own argument. Of course they should. Whether its Gregory Maxwell or some anonymous TumbleBit harry potter pseudonym, the validity of the whitepaper or submission/idea should be judged based on the weight of its logic and cost/benefit relationship.
Where I think we are getting slipped up here is in polar opposites. I dont have a problem with things being judged on their own merit. I think thats a really basic thing that applies to all things in life. I do have a problem with people shitting on experts who have spent their lives building professional experience in these systems, while at the same time championing their no-name developer who has contributed literally nothing and has no peer review whatsoever.
Its about intellectualism vs anti-intellectualism. Not to get too deep into the political side, we are seeing this anti-intellectual revolution going strong here in the USA with the Trump faction. They dismiss science, facts, empirical evidence and the like all because their favorite tv show host says "great things" about "great people". 
I see this same battle occurring here in the bitcoin space where anti-intellectualism is trying to supersede the academic peer review process with non-meritocratic developers who do not adhere to peer review.
Peer review cannot happen without reputation. If we are to review highly technical and complex papers, then who are we going to trust to review it? People we dont even know?
The reputation of individuals plays a valid role in the review process which is absolutely essential for the layman to build trust in the system. Since the layman does not have the academic experience required to review said data, then there must be a system in place which allows trust to be built.
Otherwise how could we every possibly reach consensus as layman users on a system which we can literally know nothing about? And by nothing I mean the innards. The highly complex technical aspects, which if anyone is being honest with themselves is 99% of bitcoin. It is first a cryptographic system. 


I agree, but this needs context. See below.


I think you've taken my single answer as the only answer, and that was not my intention at all. I was just going with KISS on the initial response because I didn't think you were that savvy and didn't want to delve into further technicalities because thats often counter intuitive when trying to discuss something with simple minded people, which obviously you are not.
Crytography is only one aspect. Distributed/decentralized networking systems is one of the biggest pieces of the "expert education" pie chart when it comes to the management of network resources.
Bitcoin is a cryptographic system yes, but its a cryptographic system that is encompassed by a network. That network relies upon tcp/ip networking to accomplish its rudimentary broadcast system. 
For example, I have a strong background in Networking. I've spent most of my life deep in both professional and (the much more rewarding) hobby projects related to networking. I've been to school, gotten certifications, and have near 20 years experience working with computer networks. I've managed systems that had in the thousands of computers locally, and I've dabbled in broadcast hub and spoke models on a larger scale.
In this, I'm able to articulate a lot of the nuances of the debate. So im a perfect example of someone who is not a vetted expert by the community, yet is able to provide high quality technical input regarding resource management.
So, to be more clear, what we are talking about here is network engineers. People who have worked at google or or Level3 directly as network engineers would be much more highly qualified to manage the block size resource management issues than would someone who is just specifically a cryptographer and cryptographer only.
Fortunately, there are a lot of really highly qualified individuals with heavy networking experience working for bitcoin core. For example, Bram Cohen no one could dispute is the king of distributed systems. Then there's Rusty Russel, who's spent 18 years on the linux kernel with a emphasis on the networking stack, the heaviest hitter of them all. Also Bluematt, who contributes to Open Whisper systems (Signal). maaku7 (Mark Friedenbach) is a ex NASA engineer. These are the people advocating for L2 networks since they have the background in understanding resource management problems within a decentralized network. 
I can think of very few individuals higher qualified than Rusty Russell or Bram Cohen to engineer resource management for bitcoin. 
Can you?
*Most importantly* the heart of our discussion is designed around *who should make protocol changes to the system*. We are not merely discussing redditors doing their redditing. In that respect, I do well here because im educated, experienced and willing to spend time in discourse with other individuals. But do not mistake that to mean that *I* am qualified to make protocol changes.
I am not. Ever. I doubt I will ever have the experience neccessary to theorize at a protocol level the future needs of bitcoin. Thats why we have people like Rusty Russell, who is literally "the king" of protocol development at a network stack. 
The argument that we should allow non-qualified individuals to make protocol changes is anti-intellectualism and no amount of attempting to rationalize the irrational via semantics will change that.
To see the qualifications and backgrounds of other individuals, please go to this great site! -
PS - I think economics only plays a very small role in all of this. I think its at a very basic fundamental level. Im not sure that high level complexity economic theory really benefits bitcoin, but I cannot claim im a expert so I cannot say for certain. Im sure plenty of smart people could convince me otherwise, but none of them could ever convince me that economics matters more than crytopgrahy and network resource management when it comes to bitcoins system.

Anyone who is accepting bitcoin transactions should understand how the network works. If they are using a 3rd party payment processor then it does not matter, the pp will handle rbf bs non rbf and the merchant does not need to know anything. If they are accepting btc directly then they should understand the basic premise of the network and how it works.
You're being a alarmist. It serves no function to cry wolf over a non-issue.

Did you really just accuse Adam Back, the CyperPunk who developed [HashCash, the Proof Of Work]( system that is pivotal to bitcoins success of "not writing code" ?
Thats some *straight stupidity* right there.
If you want to learn what Adam has done for bitcoin land post-bitcoin, you can [read this]( where I establish *some minor* contributions of his to the codebase.
Beyond coding, what Adam has done for bitcoin (beyond making bitcoin even possible to exist in the first place) is to provide the managerial resources to put together the highest quality team possible to advance bitcoin.
To put this on your level (in moron speak), Adam Back is a NFL football coach. There's a reason that NFL team's boards of investors are more than happy to pay [4-8 Million dollar Salaries]( for the best Coaches.
Because the coaches determine the success of their team.
Just like Adam acts as a significant role model and talent broker in this space.
Just because ignorant shits like you have tried your hardest to stall *real progress* in bitcoin by blocking SW and LN doesn't mean that those engineering feats are not real and existing.
It just means little shits like you need to get your ass stomped intellectually on reddit more often so you can go hide with your tail between your legs and stop trolling our community with your ignorant conspiracy theory shitposts.

*Expecting others to "honor" their part of the agreement (2MB HF code) when you \(maybe not you specifically, but a large % of miners\) have dishonored the agreement is not a rational conclusion.*
*Are miners special? Do they get to shit on some parts of the agreement because they are special, while others have to follow every line exactly?*

Quite the opposite. SW, which fixes malleability and provides for a much more secure blockchain is what enables LN to be used, which specifically allows for time-locked transactions to exist on the bitcoin main chain. With malleability existing, there is no way to time lock and secure funds on the main chain.
Beyond that, SW also fixes the economics on transactions, which makes for cheaper transactions. 
LN itself is a 2nd layer software application "on top" of bitcoin, so there is nothing about it that effects the security of the main net. There are several implementations of LN, such as Thunder from blockchain.info or LN directly from Dryja and Poon, which is under the Blockstream umbrella.
We have to get SW activated, which then allows for a whole host of improvements to the bitcoin protocol like MAST, Schnorr signatures, etc. These all increase security while decreasing cost of transactions by handling the data/signatures in a more efficient way and offering space savings.


I personally think that there is only a positive benefit to the network for creating node incentivisation. This is one of the beautiful parts about LN....it fixes the problem of a lack of node incentivisation that bitcoin has been missing since inception. 
LN being its own network on a different layer creates a economic opportunity for nodes to handle/store the data, while leaving most of the burdon of its network off the main chain, which is the most expensive and hardest to maintain layer due to the lack of node incentivisation.
Sounds like you know whats up already!

Tragedy of the commons. 
People upvote people because they agree with them, so why would they not downvote them when they disagree?
Its difficult to argue this logic to users, especially when all users ignore this idealogy and do it anyways. Since we cannot prevent tragedy of the commons, I will have to use my actions to my best judgement.
Besides, if we didn't behave this way then nothing would ever get to the top or the bottom. Theres a valid mechanism behind this type of behavior in our community and any community on reddit, and discovery of validity[aka judging quality of content] is *essential* to reddits success. This discovery of validity would not occur if it were not for *both* upvoting and downvoting based on personal opinion.

All of the user measurements I've seen so far have been overwhelming supportive of Core. Only a very marginal amount has been supportive of BU. This is also demonstrated by BU tokens being worth less on bitfinex as well, showing that the market doesn't think so highly of it either.

You can't just romanticize in a conservative fashion the past facts without recognizing the evolution of a system or ignore the design from the start. First of all the blocks subsidy reward goes down over time. We don't need scientific proof of this we know this explicitly.
We have always known this and we can never not know this. We can only have people like you and others who refuse to acknowledge basic facts of how the system works and then demonstrate by posting things like you just did that you don't understand how Bitcoin was supposed to work in the first place.
Miners were subsidized for their work via block reward. This allowed for cheap near free low-cost transactions to bootstrap the network. 
I think that the fact that we are here right now with the price where it's at with regulation where it's at that we have seen the Divergence from the old to the new. I also think that the fact that we're having this battle means that Bitcoin is much much much bigger then it was 4 years ago which is literally half of its lifetime. Issue were having is the same issue that every system has when it starts to grow bigger.......
There becomes more widely broad population of uneducated and unexperienced users who are trying to use life experience to explain things that simply do not apply to bitcoin. Bitcoin is something new something big something complexed something decentralized something organic and it's not something that can be explained by referencing prior experience with centralized systems.
Please stop trying to use populist agenda to explain what you think is common sense that simply does not apply to bitcoin.
Your Swiss bank account in your pocket has always needed mining fees to supplant block Rewards. Just because you and Peter R and anyone else who was smoking hopium thinking that it would last forever despite all of the evidence and Common Sense indicating otherwise does not mean that we should sacrifice the core fundamental values of Bitcoin to meet your conservative viewpoint of Pastime Romancing.
Peter R is a horrible example to use for Bitcoin. His ideas have not mustered pass peer review. 
His work does also not delve into centralization effects, something that surely happens with a system over time. You cannot advocate for changes to a system and then ignore half of that system. Some of the economic assumptions that Peter may be making might be correct but it is a typical false  is a typical false dichotomy to ignore all of the other effects within a system. Fortunately we have a well-balanced system of experts from different fields that can see cause and effect from multiple angles.
Peter has demonstrated that he is incapable from thinking for multiple angles. He has decided one Viewpoint One Direction and he is going to take that direction whether or not the negative effects destroy Bitcoin.
I am much happier with people like Peter nowhere near the center of control of the coin.

Read my post. I have good feelings for Gavin's character and expressed them. We are not discussing Gavin's character however, we are discussing *his actions*.
You seem to have a problem understanding the difference. You always jump in as soon as someone mentions gavin's many mistakes and label them as character attacks.
When someone continuously fucks up, you are right to criticize them for their fuckups. Thats whats going on here.
Its like you have incredibly thin skin and cannot discern the difference here. How difficult it must be going through life when you think that everytime someone criticizes someone else that its "an attack" on them?
You need to grow up and realize that the world is filled with constant actionabe mistakes. And you cannot grow from those mistakes unless you realize they are mistakes and learn from them.
But if everyone stands around sucking your dick and telling you what a perfect human you are and how you can do no wrong.....how are you supposed to learn that those mistakes were mistakes?
You are suggesting a fragile world where peoples feelings matter more than the impact of their mistakes.
Im suggesting anti-fragile world where people *actually learn* from their mistakes by society holding them accountable.
You've got a lot of growing up to do dude. Society is not your personal snowflake that needs to be protected from all the "villains". Society is filled with diverse people all of differing opinions and characters and we have to learn how to exist in this melting pot.
You cannot learn how to do that by being put in a protective bubble where everyones feelings must be protected.
Bitcoin is not your snowflake. Bitcoin needs resilient developers who expect it to be attacked and to design around those constraints. Gavin was not that person and proved that many times. He made many mistakes and everyone is right to hold him accountable for those mistakes. Thats not a character assassination, thats a reconciliation with *doing a bad job.*

I'll agree  to meet you half way in the middle. I also upvoted your comment for thoroughness.
I dont believe that just because we have opposing opinions that your post should be discounted. You've done good homework, provided information and done a good job. I'll revise my statement to be basically "Code exists, but has not been injected into a branch release for testing". 
And to that, you have a point. Its not been put into a branch (even a forked one) for testing. That would be mostly trivial for one of the developers of course, yet if it was a serious proposal maybe it should have been completed? I had assumed that once it was assigned a BIP # that the next step would have been to have a working proposal. Perhaps my assumption was incorrect.

Its **always** possible to separate the politics from engineering when you are engaging in discussion. The question is whether or not the other side has the intellectual honesty or perseverance to do the same. Its a tragedy of the commons because people are prone to emotion and intuition as opposed to slow rational thinking.


No, but thats not typically the conversation that is had about this topic. 99% of the conversation is related to politics. There are cost and benefits to both directions and its the careful examination of all of these costs and benefits that matters....without the politics.


And I would say that users who fire the most competent engineers are at risk of losing the value of their investment. Im not saying they cant or wont(though I think this is highly unlikely), just that there is cause and effect.


An unfortunate circumstance, on that is becoming more and more common that I see in my lifetime across many industries.
Ochlocracy only works when the userbase/public is educated enough to see alignment of incentives. When people engage in false dichotomies, which is usually a result of intellectual apathy, then those incentives will start to get out of alignment because of changes to the system that are detrimental to the whole, yet beneficial to some.

This is a myth I see commonly mis perpetrated from the BU/Big Blocks side. That we are somehow "forcing" bitcoin users to have a scaling solution the way "we" (core) wants it as opposed to the way "they" (BU) wants it.
All SW does is allow for upgrades in the future, as well as adding some very needed capacity and some optimization that helps bitcoin scale **on-chain**.
The future optimizations, such as MAST, Schnorr, etc, will also be added to bitcoin with the intention of *further* increasing bitcoin's capacity to scale **on-chain**.
All I see from Core is incredibly responsible governance in which they seek to optimize efficiency prior to "removing the brakes". If you took the code from 2013 and ran it today with a 1MB limit bitcoin would fail. That is proof of the enormous under-the-hood work that Core has done to make sure bitcoin scales *efficiently* first.
What Big blockers dont realize is that **everyone** is a big blocker(Except maybe luke-jr). I would bet that 99% (enough for consensus by far) of Core-supporting users want to see the blocksize increased. I know I do! But I want to see it increased in a responsible way that does not risk a $20B network to a hyperinflationary event such as a chain split. I've seen all too often people make the logically obvious erroneous statement that a chain split would "not be bad" for bitcoin. Basic economics tells us that minting double the current currency supply and instantly introducing it to the supply chain (into the market) would dilute the value of bitcoin. Anyone who argues against this should be called out for obvious stupidity.
- I doubt that these optimizations will be "bundled" because the amount of work (sometimes 1+year) that it takes to engineer these changes is massive and that would mean we would have to wait a very long period of time to get both, instead of just proposing one as a upgrade while working on the other.
It should be noted that this has all been knowledge within the public domain [for years now on the roadmap]( and everyone should read it to answer common misconceptions on the issues.

Its a champagne problem. We are here because bitcoin is so successful. 
Also, you can call it a "problem" but you also have to recognize that at the same time, the network is running fine so long as you pay the fee. This is great for security, great for miners, it just sucks for users who had false expectations of being able to send free or low cost transactions on a network that is protective against state-sponsored attacks.
Such a network is of course not free or cheap to maintain, so why should it be free or cheap to use? The system was designed to reduce miner subsidy over time, and we've seen miners subsidies cut into 1/4th of what it was 5 years ago. We cannot continue to wait by the sidelines and just hope that everyone has good intentions and will pay miners for their work. We should be proactive in this and recognize that without a supply side regulation there will be no rational economic counter-balance.
Sure, you can espout free market ideology here, and watch bitcoin's security slowly die away to nothing holding onto your ideology until your bitcoin is worth nothing. Or, you can recognize that humans are not going to behave altruistically via majority.
We need block size restrictions in order to compensate miners via transactional costs. Do we need it this moment? Probably not. So yes, it would be quite reasonable to raise the blocksize now.
The problem is getting it done. Core is not a dictator of bitcoin, they are open source developers. They can only propose changes and hope the community implements them. Which is exactly what they have done with SW, which is a blocksize increase.

I dont see where he stated that this was a "solution to our problems" anywhere in his post. Seems like you are the one making assumptions here.
All he did was provide a *conservative* factual representation of the compression that would be achieved should schnorr be implemented.
And, are you really saying that you think these cryptographers cannot find a solution to implementing Schnorr?
Sounds a lot like "Lightning Network is VaporWare! It wont ever work because they dont even know how to implement Routing!"
Not that it was you that said it, but its that denialist mentality where you massively underrate the excellent engineers who are working on this.
My position is simple. These guys have shown true leadership by engineering elegant solutions with optimal tradeoffs for difficult and complex situations.
I have full faith that whatever obstacles Schnorr presents in bitcoin, they will continue to succeed at finding elegant solutions to those obstacles. Instead of trying to throw sand in the gears before the gears have even turned, why not be supportive instead? That doesn't mean you have to believe in something that doesn't yet exist, but maybe give these guys just a little bit of credit for past achievements?

This is the social aspect of it. When im talking about Game Theory in the context of miners, we are talking about the economic incentive side of things.

Do you know who writes the code and doesn't give two fucks about banks? Cypherpunks.
I've seen this conspiracy theory repeated ad nauseam. Are you really accusing **cypherpunks** of colluding with bankers to co-opt bitcoin? Its as ridiculous as our EPA chief saying to the world "Carbon Emissions are not causing global warming". Its founded in so much outright fucking stupidity that it makes my brain want to explode.
I wonder at the intelligence of these loud critics every day of my life. How can you all live with such cognitive dissonance? Do you *really* think that adam back is conspiring to take over bitcoin with the help of bankers?
Do you have **no understanding whatsoever** as to the background of these people who started and are running blockstream?
Yes, they took the money. Who wouldn't? But to prove malfeasance on their part is going to be impossible, especially since they have been so hard at working making the network resilient and anti-fragile. The developers at blockstream all have a legally binding contract that says they are allowed to work on bitcoin however they please and will not take any pressure from external forces, and the contract even states that if the company is sold to a new purchaser that the new owner cannot influence their decisions, and that they will get 1 years salary to do with what they please if the new owner tries to do just that. In writing, legal contract.
I find it so simplistic that all of you trolls think that there's malfeasance on blockstreams' part when they are trying to do every goddamn thing in their power to keep the network decentralized and censorship-resistant. Dont these facts collide in your brain and make you just stop for one moment and go "duuurrr..wait a sec..." ???
Centralization is the best friend of banks. Centralization is what Gavin and Garzik were going for. Centralization is what BU causes. Centralization is the *death of bitcoin*. 
Just think. Get through the emotions and conspiracy theories and think about the logic of your argument for 10 seconds.
Then when your done thinking about that, think about the fact that [literally the best cryptographers in the world have stated that scaling bitcoin on-chain without eliminating decentralization is currently impossible.](
I find it laughable that these *kids* come into the scene, write some shitty code that causes forks, can barely even copy and paste code from core to their repro and now they have a following....
How idiotic are you and everyone else that follows the people making impossible claims while all of the provably smartest academics with the most real world experience within the industry of cryptography and digital money says otherwise?
Follow the scientists, academics and engineers if you want the truth. Follow the dipshits that promise the sun and the moon on the necklace at your own peril.
Just run your own code. Stop advocating for the hostile takeover of bitcoin. You are accusing the maintainers of bitcoin for doing exactly what you and your crew are *doing this very moment*.

Fortunately for the rest of the world you do not get to decide what is the common meaning of terms for the rest of the world.
Decentralization is a term that has a well defined meaning and can be applied to any context. I understand what you are saying, but you are ignoring all of the people who say BU has decentralized development, and that Core is centralized. Yes, people commonly say this. It sounds crazy, but it happens all the time. So you cannot lay claim to a common meaning for a specific term because you are not god and you dont know know all that goes on, and all that is said.
The solution here is to not over step yourself and make claims contrary to obvious definitions.
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:32:16


That is not a valid argument and it is one that has been disproven many times. Gavin has tried to make these naive arguments endlessly and he has been endlessly wrong. This is why Gavin does not deserve any amount of control.
If  Satoshi designed this perfect system with perfect incentives, then why has there been people who have been willing to waste massive amounts of BTC in coordinated attempts to push a ideological agenda ? Why is there terminology commonly used to explain things like "selfish mining"? The incentives are not perfect and BU takes those imperfections and multiplies them.
Assuming altruistic behavior​ is both naive and stupid, especially when it's been demonstrated so many times that humans are willing to behave in really irrational ways to achieve an agenda.
Gavin is wrong. Satoshi was not perfect. The system that exists right now is very good at stonewalling these types of attack vectors. BU introduces new much easier attack vectors. These attack vectors, when played out has a cost and effect.
Now that we have established the appeals to authority here are ridiculous, let's talk about the real question you asked. There is the centralization of three things. Development, Nodes and Miners.
Development is easy to understand. One side you have hundreds of devs, the other you have......2?  Obviously one is decentralized and the other is centralized. So that is factually obvious for anyone to see.
For Nodes it gets more complicated. I have explained this in full [here]( and you can see I go into more depth on this specific node issue in one of the replies.
Regarding miner centralization, there is a good thread [here](
The problem is these issues are not trivial to understand. You want information on a complicated set of issues but you probably want a easy answer. There are few easy answers here and it takes study to grasp it.
The common sense answer(though obviously an incomplete one) is BU takes away from the automation of the consensus protocol and adds human elements. This is a clear step backwards. Humans are irrational and when you give them control they will fuck things up like always. 
Frankly though, it's obvious that you are just Roger sock puppet. Nice new account preaching the Satoshi gospel. Totally new to Bitcoin right?

Except thats outright false. The majority of the community has already adopted SW and the benefits are immediate not delayed. That was a valid argument a year ago but not anymore.
Major wallet providers and exchanges have adopted segwit. They generate the majority of blockchain activity. This means that the majority of transctions will very quickly be SW compatible tx's to SW addresses which offer the space savings.


You cannot compromise bitcoins core security model for a temporary reduction in cost. Research has shown 8mb blocksize node impact is **drastic** and the bitfury paper argues that we would lose 90% of the nodes with 8mb.
90% dude.
Thats not decentralization. Thats not censorship resistent.

Same thought went through my head when reading this. I cannot tell if he is intentionally utilizing double speak, or if he is just so entrenched with his own dogma that he does not see his own actions.
Its often very difficult for people to see their own actions for what they really are because they are living in their own meatsacks with this crazy brain taking control of everything and twisting things to make sense of all the actions that meatsack is doing.
You have a pretty clear divide here.
One side wants to give control to a already-centralized mining cabal. No one with half a brain could ignore the fact that Jihan Wu, the largest producer of the majority of the ASIC's on this planet has central influence over a near-majority of bitcoin's hashrate. 
You cannot ignore this fact while applying game theory as to how this would work.
The other side wants users across the *entire spectrum* to have a balanced decision making process. By allowing satoshi's vision of how the network works to exist, we have full-nodes keeping miners honest by refusing to validate their blocks if they dont play by the consensus rules of the majority.
EC tries to change the balance of power. Just like you have the 3 tiers of the American political system, the executive the judicial and the legislative branch, you have the miners, the node operators and the end users. All 3 of these factions work both for and against each other to maintain the balance of power. If one single faction gains too much power then that faction will ultimately be corrupted by human influence and be perverted for the self interests of individuals instead of the interests of the public.
Even if we did not have clear anti-intellectualism threatening bitcoins security model, even if we did have "benevolent dictators" running the mining industry, there is no guarantee that those dictators would remain uninfluenced or not co-opted. But we dont have benevolent dictators. We have instead irrational dictators who have demonstrated they are unwilling to work in the best interest of both themselves and the network.
Remember when ghash got over 50% and everyone freaked out? It was right to freak out. Because even if ghash meant well, how can we rule out the possibility of them being hacked or co-opted by their government, or blackmailed by a extortionist to do crazy shit with their power?
Simple game theory expects irrational actors to exist in the system. Its a *trustless* system, and EC tries to make one of the parties trusted.
This completely goes against everything bitcoin has stood for. It turns a trustless permissionless system into a trusted permissioned system.
There is so much crack smoking here going on its difficult to sort through all of the delusions.
@_date: 2017-03-25 21:25:00
Original proof and submission goes to from his thread @ 
Just thought that this needed more information so that people can see this isn't a conspiracy theory.
The market has had a clear continuous downtrend since the drama started. If Jihan thinks that this is the "best path forward for bitcoin" then he must think that bitcoin, and his investments, should be worth less money.
Economic incentives only work if the actors in the system are smart enough to do what is in their best economic interest. This is why we must have a decentralized miner system, because when one stupid individual with too much power starts to spread gospel on ideologically driven agenda, then others will start to follow and ignore rational indicators. Yes, even against their own economic interests.
This is proof that bitcoins biggest threat still is mining centralization. 
You want to say that the price drop is all because of the ETF, sure, go ahead. You are going to have a difficult time explaining why the market shrugged like it was nothing for days after the rejection though. If the market really cared about the ETF that much then we would have not seen a come back and then a steady hold in the 1100-1200 range.
Clearly the miners are causing this drama, and whether or not it is intentional is irrelevant. People can do the most damage with the best of intentions, as Roger Ver has proven with his advocation of BU.
The road to hell is paved with good intentions, and its time to recognize that these good intentions are really really bad for bitcoin.
We need to get rid of the poison. Maybe it is time for a fork. It seems we are going to loose value regardless, and maybe bankrupting all of these idiots out of bitcoin is the best thing for bitcoin.
My stance on the situation is slowly evolving, but im not as hardcore on my stance any longer. Clearly there is a major threat to bitcoin right now and we are in for rocky times regardless of outcome.
Hopefully UASF will smooth things out.
BTW I duplicated the date bar on the bottom so that people can line up the date range of the drop with the exact timing of antpool mining BU.
Its pretty obvious that their actions have directly contributed to a drop of market value.

Bitcoins biggest threat always was mining centralization. People like this prove that we must reduce their power as much as possible to prevent them from cornering bitcoin.
Its horribly Orwellian for him to accuse core of being a dictatorship when all they do is write software, whereas he has successfully cornered the ASIC production market and is a monopolistic force.
If you examine the facts, if anyone is a threat of dictatorship it is Jihan, not Core.
Im sure all of the rbtc trolls (ver's employee's and Jihan fanboys) will respond to this with various blockstream conspiracy theories. Yes, tell me all about their VC funding. You'll have to explain how that VC money has specifically co-opted development, however, because all I've seen core produce is fantastic engineering that breaks down barriers and allows for bitcoin to scale into the future.

Never before have I seen such a coordinated co-opt attempt of bitcoin. The same people who are accusing core of co-opting bitcoin (by continuing the contribution of open source code to a years-long project?) are the one's attempting to co-opt bitcoin.
What we are now seeing is a clear social attack on bitcoins social fabric. Now the real test.
If bitcoin splits it has failed in its mission at being resistant to social pressures through nakamoto consensus.

I would like to say its really difficult to have a intelligent conversation with someone when they are so out of the loop that they make ridiculous statements like this. What do you think SW is? Its a blocksize increase.
The only developer I know that wants to stay at 1MB is luke-jr, and no one takes luke seriously. He has extreme ideologies and are not founded in realistic goals.
Its nearly unanimous across the board that *all* developers want a blocksize increase. 


Its been the exact opposite for me. The closer I look the more I see how reckeless gavin has been, how he has been willing to sacrifice the fundamental properties of bitcoin for a short-term goal.
You cannot sacrifice security for short term cost reduction. That is the exact opposite of what a careful responsible custodian should be doing. Its a good thing for bitcoin that Gavin is no longer in charge because his actions demonstrated a lack of foresight. If anyone should have been in charge of bitcoin it should have been Hal Finney. He was the one to show real foresight.

The entire economy. You cannot acknowledge the majority of the industry running bitcoin core and then not acknowledge that its not running classic, BU or XT.
Its only logical to conclude that had the community embraced the likes of those clients, that we would then be running those clients.
As im sure you well know, bitcoin is *hard* to change. It requires overwhelming consensus across the entire board in order for that change to occur. This is to protect it, not hinder it. This is one of bitcoins best features.
So in order for a non-incumbent policy or idea to come along, it needs to convince the vast majority of the community that it is better for the community.
None of those clients have come close. The closest of them all was XT, because it garnered incumbent support from developers who had sway with industry members, so it had some amount of economic support behind it. The others have been a very small minority when accounting for entire industry. Measuring by miner support alone is obviously a very faulty metric because it ignores the rest of the industry that is pivotal to supporting a specific client.

Yes, anyone can fork their own altcoin at any point. You can make a 2mb chain right now by changing your code and running it. But obviously you cannot get the rest of the Bitcoin network to follow you because they don't agree with your rule change.
Trying to compare forking a altcoin to bitcoins consensus mechanism is demonstrative that you don't understand Bitcoin.
The entire point of the consensus mechanism is that you run the software with the rules set so that the network can ignore those who don't play by the rules and allowing everyone who is playing by the rules to get along without fuss.
Having a dynamic setting where any miner at any time can craft a block that forks the network is absolutely not part of bitcoins design or consensus mechanism.. Satoshi was not that stupid. He would not take away from the automated processes and introduce a human element. That's the exact opposite of bitcoins original goal ....To automate the social decisions through code.
What you and BU is suggesting is to go backwards, to introduce social attacks Into Bitcoin but this time at the consensus layer.
You don't seem to get the Anti-fragile aspect of Bitcoin. It's meant to be resilient against attackers. Emergent consensus creates cheap and easy attack vectors. You assume malicious actors and then you design around them.
You do not assume honest actors and then design around that. That's what BU does and it's juvenile.

You think there's no reason why core couldn't prove to the community that hard forks are no big deal...?
How? By merging a BIP that changes a consensus rule?
That would be against all of the rational thinking they've put into the subject over the past 4 years. It would abandon all responsible behavior and advocate for experimenting on the bitcoin blockchain.
Why do you think they advocate for soft forks instead? Because its a way to upgrade the network without disrupting it.
I think you are creating a circular argument that cannot be proven in an attempt to make yourself sound right. Its basically like this...
"Core can do this, but since they wont I cant be proven wrong"
Thats not a very effective argument. It leads to no where and is pointless speculation considering the above info.

That's quite naive.
Bitcoin is a cryptographic system yes, but that's only one part. Have you completely forgotten about Bitcoin the network?
Experience in resource management on distributed platforms is worth its weight in gold when it comes to Bitcoin. I would trust Bram over a 100 economists any day. Our scaling issues have to do with resource management, which networking engineers are better suited to handle than cryptographers. 
That's why Rusty Russell working on Bitcoin is so fucking awesome.

Again, you are just demonstrating you do not understand how peer review works.
Reputation absolutely matters in peer review. 100 NACK's from contributors who are unknown are not equal to a single ACK from Peter or Greg.
This is how academics work. Your identity is essential to establishing reputation and that reputation is weighted when it comes to peer review. It does not even have to be your real name, it can be a identity you've established that you use to code with. You can be "stranger123" but if stranger123 has a history of 1000 commits then his reputation will have been hard earned and his ACK's will mean more when it comes time to merge a pull request.

You forgot the 3rd option, which is you.
Anyone who supports Gavin for supporting CW is lacking critical thinking skills.


No, we think that CW bamboozled him. It would have been trivial to an expert to perform a redirect attack, especially when they were in control of the situation (hardware used, where the meeting was held, etc)
So when gavin installed a fresh copy of electrum to check the signature, likely the software he installed was not from electrum. This is why the signature passed.
CW has been proven to be a outright scam artist by *many* reputable journalists.
You cannot possibly expect anyone to take you seriously defending this situation. Can't say im surprised to see you here defending the undefendable though....
You've been doing a lot of that. 
Since im sure you've forgotten, I actually like Gavin. I think he's a good person at heart. But dont confuse intelligence as being immune to naivety. People who are high IQ are often low EQ.

That "extra data" is not signature data for p2pkh. So no, of course adding non-payment data to the blockchain is not a blockspace increase. You do realize that despite its name, that segregated witness is still all one block right? That they are not separated? This is a common misconception. There are not two blocks, only one, that is larger with SW.
So yes, obviously when you are creating a larger container to host more aggregate signature data specifically from payment addresses, yes, that **is a blocksize increase**. All its doing is just partitioning the block differently to fix malleability. 
You are very confused as to the technical details. You've demonstrated this half a dozen times throughout this conversation.

My reply to that response is still the same. What do you think they were doing for the last 4 years? Sitting around with their thumbs in their assholes talking about how they hate all their users and want to sabatoge bitcoin?
No, they were busy writing literally over a million lines of code. Go do a line count on SegWit + Lightning Networks and then tell me im wrong.


Because he's a douchey little child who wanted to be the dictator of bitcoin and then cried like a baby when he didn't get his way, **because the users rejected his ideas**.
Are you **seriously** defending Mike Hearn, or championing his actions? 


That **what** was happening? Core working every day 24/7 non-stop on solutions?
Why do you keep ignoring this? Everything you say is entirely irrelevant when you accept this point.

And to think, they are doing it in a way that still allows for everyone to behave as if they dont exist! That way me and everyone else can *voluntarily* utilize a brilliant upgrade, while you can *voluntarily* choose to ignore it and continue to use bitcoin as-is.

Clicking some buttons isn't too hard of a learning curve.

Especially when you consider that is the foundation that the USA is built upon. Our system is a decentralized governmental structure in which the states balance the authority of the federal government.
Its all too easy for people born and living in the last 75 years to think that the federal government has always been this strong and powerful. It of course has not, and what made it into the bloated poisonous blog of bureaucracy it is today is the creation of the IRS.
If you go pre-IRS and look at what power the federal branch of the government had, you'll see a really nice decentralized system with checks and balances of power that were by design.
The erosion of our liberties is due to the centralization effects from our federal government. You can see this clearly exhibited by the feds doing raids on medical marijuana dispensaries in states where it is 100% legal.
This overreach would not be possible without economic funding and too much power.

No, but one does have to be a Cryptographer to code the cryptographic assurances/proofs of a cryptographic system. This means that non-cryptographers are much more likely to introduce weaknesses and outright failures within the codebase.
Lets not dance around the topic here, we are talking about a cryptographic system. It absolutely requires cryptographers to do it best. 
Would it be better to have cryptographers who also have a background in Economics?
Maybe. See below, its not clear to me. Probably, but not assuredly. 
How many people do you know that fit that bill that have not already come to bitcoin or prior cryptographic projects? I think immediately of people like Nick Szabo, who fits the bill perfectly (and is probably satoshi or part of a team that is satoshi). People like Adam back. Who else could you think of that would be higher qualified that are already not working on bitcoin?
Your statement that we need non-cryptographers to help "design" economic incentives has some validity, in that we obviously need thought leaders in the space who can do ample game theory. Im all for meritocratic systems.
Where we start to get foggy in this conversation is "who is best" to help "design bitcoins economic incentives" ?
Would a person with a Economics Masters, or a PhD be best suited to handle bitcoin?
I would say this is not a black and white issue. We must always remember that bitcoin is the antithesis to the incumbent financial system. It was intentionally created to be a **polar opposite** to the current Keynesian system that our society relies upon.
How could anyone properly argue that the incumbents who are indoctrinated by the incumbent dogmatic economic system are "best suited" to organize this antithesis to that system? People like Jorge Stofli and Professor Bitcorn come to mind.
It does not make very much sense when you put it in perspective.
Now, that does not mean that basic market economic principals dont apply. Obviously the laws of demand and supply are still the same in bitcoin as they are in other incumbent financial systems.
And we have plenty of cryptographers who have a solid economic grasp on basic economic laws and principals that apply to bitcoin.


They are absolutely inherently "better" than the other when the context of the discussion is a cryptographic system. Do not introduce a red herring into the discussion by trying to distract from the fact we are talking about a cryptographic system.


I formerly retract my statement and humbly apologize. You do seem reasonably aware, even if you seem to be engaging in misrepresenting the needs of the system.

In order to understand you need to read the reserarch. The whitepaper talks quite clearly about the sampling pool used for the research and how it applies. 
Also, you are assuming costs for 1st world countries. This is a false dichotomy. You need to realize that bitcoin is global and that in order for decentralization to work that we need to support people with low-resource capital. If we follow your end-game logic, it basically ends with "Well we can just host everything in a data center then!" ....which I already responded to quite thoroughly.


Security is not important in bitcoin? Thats funny. You must be new to bitcoin.


It was an analogy. Do you know this word? Do you understand what it means?

New wallet/address/key = new ownership.
There is nothing different between a opendime and a new private key, assuming that both are secure, which they should be if you are the owner/creator of both.

You are right, I shouldn't have used that word. Since you are paying the fee, its not artificial, but it is creating "bloated" fee rates, which are then algorithmically calculated by wallets, fee estimators and the likes, which are then reinforced by others like yourself. Its circular.


Im not saying you should, what I am saying is that since your business model is being negatively impacted from the reality that you should advocate for the system that fixes it.


Eh, not really. Most of us here on are supporters of "marginally larger" blocksizes. The key word there is marginally. I think its a bit disingenuous to imply that people who are vocally advocating for a 4MB blocksize increase (SW) are "against blocksize increases".
There is a lot of propaganda and misinformation freely flowing here and in "other places" that Core supporters are against blocksize raises. I think this is garbage, because how could we support the increases that SW brings when its double what the others want with the most dominant competing alternative client?
SW is a literal larger blocksize increase than what BU is proposing. So how does that make us "small blockers" and them "big blockers" ?
What you are seeing here is people who are willing to recognize and engineer safe tradeoff's vs people who dont acknowledge the tradeoff's that occur, and instead want to do it to just "see how it works".
SW is optimization. BU is taking all of the problems we already have, and then amplifying them by increasing a limit without optimization. Then, as if that were not bad enough, they want to throw gasoline on the issue by giving miners more control *while they are demonstrating they are the greatest threat to bitcoin*.
The LN dev's also said in the first scaling bitcoin in a presentation that the optimal blocksize would be 32MB! I would love to get to that point. Thats how much of a "small blocker" I am ;)
Now, lets say you are a fan of Classic. Just a flat increase, no "emergent consensus". Well, we still run into the issue of increasing the blocksize without optimizing for on-chain scaling. You still have the issue of un-aligned UTXO incentives. 
UTXO is going to increase regardless. Whether we enable SW or not. Since RAM is the greatest bottleneck on nodes, and UTXO impacts RAM, can you at least acknowledge that a blocksize increase "doubles down" on RAM impact, and therefore node count?
You're a righteous dude. You advocate for the kind of freedom I want. But we cannot have that freedom unless bitcoin remains decentralized. We cannot remain decentralized by decreasing nodes, or increasing miner factions.

Ad hominem is using a character attack to *distract* from the conversation. Since im not doing that, and since I've defended my side with rich information, you cannot claim ad hominem.


Thats not how bitcoin works. Miners dont get to decide the rules, the economic users (node operators) do. You just dont understand bitcoin. You are not really advocating for changing the consensus rules so that miners have *more power* are you? Because that would be madness and thats exactly what BU proses.

Yes, keep the heat up and keep attention on it. It needs to be brought to attention of the Chinese government as well. I think it would be beneficial to petition the government with this information.
Bitcoin needs to be anti-fragile and right now China is bitcoins most major weakness. It used to be their corrupt exchanges with fraudulent trading activity that sent bitcoin on a constant rollercoaster.
Now it is mining centralization.
I think the world would be better off without China's involvement in bitcoin. I would be more than happy to see bitcoin go back down to $300 if it meant no more chinese involvement in trying to strong arm bitcoin by centralizing mining.
If this action forces the government to go after miners, then this could only be a good thing for the long term stability of bitcoin.

[Right here, where you demonstrated you are confused on the basic fundamental rules of bitcoin](
Listen, its easy to say you are whatever you want to say on the internet. Its very difficult to prove it. So unless your willing to disclose your identity (I have, and do, all the time, to prove things), then you only have one way of demonstrating you are an engineer.
By behaving like one.
Engineers dont assume they know the answers to problems they've never studied in detail.
You've proven by the comment I just referenced that you barely understand bitcoin at all. Anyone who has studied bitcoin would not have made the very basic mistakes you made. You outright claimed things were "consensus rules" that were not consensus rules. Consensus rules are a pivotal basic fundamental aspect of bitcoin. You cannot demonstrate you dont understand the most basic fundamental aspects of a system, and then claim that because you are a "pilot and engineer" that you should automatically understand everything bitcoin related.
All that does is indicate to me that you are most likely lying about your profession, and that you are just another sock puppet, troll, or a dunning-kruger coming onto this sub claiming to be an expert on things you know little to nothing about.

It appears (to me) that Gavin saw a need, took that need upon his shoulders and did the best job he could.

If the code doesn't pass the muster, it shouldn't be used. But lets not pretend that this is a bitcoin Core product. 
Clearly its not. In fact, I've often wondered if a Core developer submitted this under the shaolinfry pseudonym. I think this proves that is not the case and there is no negligence on Core's part.
Hopefully we will see a new implementation submitted and peer reviewed with proposed changes, fixes, and then extensive testing prior to rollout.

I see where you are going with this, and I think its a good discussion.
But after writing that, you cannot see how the entire discussion is prone to relevance? ~~There does not seem to be a "right" answer to this subject, merely different point of views.~~ EDIT - After thinking it through more, I think there is a clear answer. See my last paragraph.
So you dont think the Proof of Work contributes any value to bitcoin? That viewpoint would greatly contrast with what a large portion of the community thinks. I think that is a backbone of a basic assumption of bitcoins value since day one. Whether or not that was organically created through culture or set philosophically by the creator is of course open for dialog.


So you think if gold was so abundent that all you had to do was dig into the top soil with your hands in your backyard that it will still be valued at what it is valued at today? Just like all you had to do was run your cpu on your desktop for a few weeks to earn thousands of bitcoins in 2009? 
I think you are engaging in a false dichotomy here. The difficulty of mining a scare asset directly correlates to its value. Bitcoin was worth a fraction of a penny when it was easy to mine. So the value of bitcoin directly correlates with its difficulty of mining/scarcity.


That does not take away from the work that it took to "create" them. Just like the value of gold is based upon scarcity, if there were no reserves of gold left because we dug them all up, gold would still hold its value based on its scarcity.


I think its important here that he does not try to define "how many" joules spent. The amount of joules needed to mine a block in 2009 was many extreme orders of magnitude less than how many is needed today. Yet in neither situation does it take away from the fact that one does have to spend joules in order to create the block. The laws of physics and thermodynamics are quite clear here.
I think its important to recognize that work derrived in combination with scarcity is what correlates value. It is not neither nor "equally either" but the balance of two that derrives value.
But no one could possibly argue that bitcoin could be created without expending energy. That is black and white, and that can be said with a 100% certainty. So if bitcoin cannot be created without expending energy, then how could you possibly deny that bitcoin is a proof of joules spent? The two seem to follow a logical course in that one cannot be possible without the other being true.

Intentions do not nullify negligence. You are both right however because the road to hell is paved with good intentions and Ver has only the best. Yet his best intentions do not invalidate the technical superiority that Core is offering. When you line up the feature differences we are literally talking 1M+ lines of code with L2 networks. That's the solution Core has helped engineer.
What has anyone else done? Changed a few parameters? 
With the full knowledge in mind there is no way anyone could rationalize that Ver is anything less than negligent. That's literally best case scenario.

Great, considering most of the time im correct on these particular issues. Thats what comes with years of daily research into a subject, something an engineer would understand that without, cannot be achieved.


Yes, they were not just redundant, some were outright false. 3 out of the 8 things you listed were not consensus rules.


Sorry but I dont adhere to your life philosophy. If you want to be recognized as something on the internet then the burden of proof is upon you. It is not my prerogative to assume that everything everyone says on the internet is true. That would be insanity.
It would also be insanity considering that I've already evaluated the context and made a determination against that "faith".
If you want people to believe you are a engineer, act like it. Dont go around telling people "im a engineer" and then act like we should just assume you are telling the truth and give your words more merit because of your claim.
Its the exact opposite. The merit of your words will be judged on the knowledge you present, and the logical reasoning you put forward.
So far I've not seen a very good job of that. I've just seen you complain about the fact that people on the internet are not taking you seriously.

Then it appears that you are not much interested in bitcoin because between XT, Classic and BU there has been non stop community discussion. This has occured for the last 3 years.
There will be another one, called BitcoinXL (supposedly from leaked memo's which nullc sourced) which will undoubtedly replace BU as leading shit-client.
Finding high quality software engineers to work on a project that runs on ideological preference instead of peer consensus is difficult. You would need to find developers that are already entrenched in this political philosophy (Gavin, Garzik) to spearhead the projects. However as we've seen, the community rejected them as well, so good luck to all the rookies who wish to take over a $20B network.

Thats simply not true, I see the BU dev's post here. Also, anyone can create a account at any time. The people who were banned from this sub got banned for mostly valid reasons. I say mostly because I have no doubt that a few got swept up a few years ago when theymos went on his cencorship rampage. But nothing stopped any of these people from creating new accounts and continuing here. In fact, as im sure you are well aware, thats happened but 100x fold. Ask BashCo how often he has had to deal with sock puppets in the last few years and he'll give you a ear full. 
There's also the issue of users from either or Roger Ver's paid army of sock puppets coming over here and vote brigading topics and comments to skew the perspective. This has a very damaging effect on perception and can completely change the way that people read and absorb information. Dont believe me? [See the proof for yourself](
Also, there has been research done on reddit where people were able to completely influence the narrative of a particular subject by using sock puppets to upvote and downvote material. They found threshholds involved, and that there is a catalyst for a subject going one way or another just by merely getting a small portion of votes going. Then people tend to exhibit confirmation bias and roll with the flow. I can't find the exact article im looking for, but there's plenty of information on the subject.
could probably provide better info.
But *most* people got banned for shitposting. Want a good example of the type of shitposting? Head over to and look at the top upvoted comments. Almost all of them are conspiracy theories, lies, and downright delusion.
Thats the kind of stuff we dont need here and frankly good riddance to it.

Had you provided that context in your original post, I wouldn't have quoted you out of context. It was too vague and I didn't get what you were trying to say.
And I *still* dont get what you are trying to retort. Yes, I said "just fine" and nothing you said seems to counter bitcoin working as a payment system *just fine* for the past 6 years.


You know what else we dont need? Random people on the internet trying to tell us *what, how, where* and *why* we should use bitcoin.
And when that same value as coffee payment was for my *medication*, or my *porn subscription*?  This whole "coffee" word being used congruently as a slander to bitcoins usage is f'ing ridiculous. If I want to use bitcoin for coffee, porn or buying Jesus stickers, then that is *my* prerogative and you can stay the fuck out of it. 
Gavin was rather coherent here. You should let this sink in ....


*You* are one of those people and *you* can stay the fuck out of my business.
Go ahead, show me where satoshi claimed "bitcoin was not created for *coffee*". SHOW IT TO ME. I've been around this community for a long time. I've seen it change a *lot* and I really hate whats going on right now. The vision has been perverted and its absurd.

This doesn't make any sense. As soon as the blocksize increases his fee's go back to pre-blocks-full levels. So he completely eliminates his extra fee revenue by advocating a blocksize increase. Which goes directly against his economic interest. 
The question is, how do you improve your cost/benefit relationship of this tradeoff? If we *have* to increase blocksize, how do we do it in a way that still maintains fee revenue for miners?
Well, for starters, increasing the utility of the network so there are exponential more business use cases is the absolute best way to do it.
Advocating for a HF 2MB increase is not adding business opportunities. Its merely taking away revenue for a short time and then putting the entire network right back to the drama where blocks-full started. It does not open any new doors into bitcoin. All it does is redistribute costs from users paying transactions to nodes shouldering increased resources. So in the 2MB HF tradeoff we are trading end-user costs to node costs, which means trading a "cheaper bitcoin experience" for a greatly decreased security model. 
LN creates a entire new industry of case-uses for bitcoin without impacting the security model of bitcoin. In fact, when you understand how it all works you'll realize it actually improves the security model. Decentralized 2nd layers competition for blockspace on the main chain will only increase miner revenue and therefore security, while redistributing the resources across its economically incentivized nodes, *instead of shouldering the burdeon on to bitcoins non-economically-incentivized nodes*. One is intelligent, and the other is straight dumb.


This only shows that you are in the same pool as Jihan. You have no foresight and cannot see the obvious. All you've done is say "Im ignorant on this topic and can't really see through the fog".
Thats not a very good argument.
If you *really* understood bitcoin and LN, you would see the beautiful future that I and many others do. I cannot teach you this, its up to you to put the hours in to learn the system. I've spent years daily studying to get to this point and have adequately demonstrated on this sub that I get the bigger picture.

@_date: 2017-03-19 18:00:15


Of course man, im not new here I was here when all of that drama unfolded.


For the most part thats what it is. My assumption is generally correct. When you are debating on public forums, you dont speak to a very small minority, you try to speak in a way that is influential to the majority. Unless of course you are targeting that minority.
But for the most part, *it is* "core vs BU". XT is dead. Classic is dead. The numbers speak for themselves, why would I concern myself arguing for a dead client?


I myself cheered when I saw BU nodes take a nose dive the other day. They were actively being exploited. I dont think its wrong to take joy in seeing your opponents weaknesses exposed. Especially when we are discussing a supposedly anti-fragile system. This exposed how fragile this codebase (BU) is, and how its no where near ready for primetime.
Its productive because it illuminates *really serious* issues that need to be illuminated. You dont know whether a system is weak or not until you attack it. Remember the first malleability attacks? They sucked at the time, but it forced the economic majority to write better code to protect against those types of attacks. This was good for bitcoin.
If BU really is a viable solution, then they will adapt, grow stronger, and prove their worth. I dont think they will however. They've demonstrated incompetence both at a programming level and at a management level.


Thats playing loose and fast with the truth. The war was started when Mike Hearn (yea, remember that guy?) started with XT. The war was started by Hearn and Gavin trying to take over bitcoin with their alternative client, despite gavin posting on bitcointalk in 2011 to satoshi saying that alternative clients are a big threat to co-opting bitcoin.


Don't you find it at least marginally confusing that one would advocate for XT, which was ran by Mike Hearn, who purposefully tried to sabatoge bitcoin and then went to *work for the bankers* ? Gavin has a pretty soiled history as well.
We really want these people in charge? That doesn't make very much sense.
These people started the war by creating a ideological faction. No one else started it. It was Mike Hearn, then championed by Gavin. Those two are responsible and earn the lion's share of the blame, with Theymos thrown in the mix for taking a fire and throwing gasoline on it.
You can't reasonably blame anyone else.


Funny, I see it quite clearly as the exact opposite.


It mostly does however. Yes, I know there are segments that are anti-core and neutral or anti-BU, but we are talking about a very small segment here.
Im more concerned with the larger segment that is currently posing a threat.

At the cost of damaging the network efficiency, reputation and trust.
Thats not would I would describe as something "extremely talented minds" would do, sorry. *Extremely taleneted minds* would have mediated the problem before it occurred, especially since we've *been discussing the problem for 4 years now*.
There's no doubt that the entire core team is filled with brilliance. But in this particular case, I wholly disagree with their tactics. They've decided to allow the curtains to catch fire, remain on fire, even though they knew the fire was going to occur. That does not strike me as intellectual planning and "ho hum we get to see how the network reacts!" is not a justification, but rather a post-analysis of the situation, such as "Wow, see how the fire curls up at the top? Notice how the threads just melt right down to the bottom and pool up before burning to a crisp?"

And despite all these doublings, the hashrate continues to skyrocket. It would not do so with the halving so close unless the halving was already priced into their long term ROI.
This is what pisses me off about the current blocksize drama. As our network becomes congested to the point of inefficiency, we are told that a small increase is dangerous to decentralization, but what they really want to see is bitcoin become a settlement layer *only* with a fee market develop over constrained blockspace.  The entire process feels disingenuous with hidden motives.

For those who may not know, Christian Decker is a LN dev. You may remember him from the ["I bought a Cat" blog post]( that Rusty posted where they demonstrated their first LN "purchase"/transaction.
I have been saying the same thing recently and I feel like im fighting an army of idiots. I think said it very simply and elegantly [here](


Clearly Jihan has demonstrated that he is a bad combo - Ignorant and greedy.
We simply need to educate him on the economic realities of the networks he is fighting. It will take time, and a lot of translation, but it can be done.
We need more academics and individuals writing blogs on the subject and then having it converted to chinese.
He has demonstrated that he does not understand what his own economic best interest is. He is using his position of power to abuse the community at his misperceived "economic best interest".
This is really bad for bitcoin.
Bitcoin works if the miners are smart enough to see what their best economic interest is. But if they are so stupid or arrogant that they refuse to do basic research on subjects, then how can they know what their best economic interests are?
Jihan is a clear example of this.
Miners should *not* be looking to this guy for advice. He has clearly sabotaged bitcoin for his misperceived self interests and we have too many people following his words.
This is a **perfect demonstration** as to why mining centralization is bad. You get one ringleader who is demonstrably stupid getting an army of followers and bam, suddenly the road to hell is paved with good intentions.

Which is like saying "We should upgrade the engine but not the brakes".
You need to optimize before you increase capacity. One is a *real* scaling solution where the latter is "kicking the can down the road". But for that analogy to make sense, there needs to be consequences to kicking the can. Like maybe after you kick it, it sprays bullets and kills employee's of the soda company who help stabalize the soda-factory.
People who are not intelligent experienced engineers kick the can down the road. Real engineers engineer *solutions* to problems instead of applying a bandaid that falls off in a week.
For example, here is [a list of improvements made by bitcoin core to help bitcoin scale on-chain]( 
Without those improvements, the network would not be functional today. If you took code from 2013, when the blocksize debate started heating up, and then implemented it today with 1MB (not even 2MB, just 1!) the network would literally not work. It would not be able to keep up with the transaction resources that is put upon the network by the CPU and needed RAM. That shows how much work has been put under the hood into bitcoin to get it to scale on-chain.
What you are suggesting is to increase the attack space of bitcoin at the reduction of cost to its users, but what you dont realize is that your merely shouldering the cost from users to node operators. Instead of the users paying higher transaction fee's for security, you are going to trade the cost they are paying and instead multiply that cost by orders of magnitude upon the few nodes.
Spreading the cost of transactions onto the users is *much* smarter than narrowing it upon the node operators. One can naturally find an economic equilibrium and maintain that balance, while the other is [undeniably going to drastically decrease the decentralization of the network](
SW fixes malleability and aligns economic incentives better to reduce UTXO bloat. Its smart. Also, by fixing malleability it allows for 2nd layer networks who *actually can* economically incentivize their nodes to maintain the network to compete for market share. This creates a *true* free market where the participants have aligned economic incentives that improves the experience for everyone. The users, the node operators, the miners, everyone. While increasing the blocksize automatically shifts the economic incentives *against* node operators and thereby decreases decentralization. You must examine the cost-benefit relationship to come to a conclusion as to the "best path forward". What path leads to the best balanced economically aligned incentives?
Beyond SW, it opens the doors for extension blocks, MAST, Schnorr Signatures and a host of other improvements that will drammatically increase on-chain scaling capabilities. Which is what everyone wants, yet they dont know the data well enough that they instead fight against their own best interests.
I know its been a minute since you've been posting here ...I remember you used to post here a lot years ago. But I think you are not examining all of the data before drawing your conclusions.

Do you know what the phrase "contentious" means? You should look it up. It matters a lot.
Also, your assumption that we have nothing but rational actors within the ecosystem is provably false. Your assumption that even under non-contentious terms we could hard fork "safely" is now entirely under doubt with all of the evidence of irrational actors holding large resources within the ecosystem.
You clearly dont understand that some actors greatly profit off negativity, FUD and fear.  This is why the hard decisions are left to the engineers and academics, because they can apply the appropriate amount of research and game theory to situations to determine risk profiles and act accordingly.
You though?
You know nothing in comparison to these academics. Even I, someone who has invested years of daily study into the subject of bitcoin the network is a rookie compared to the academic giants operating in our space. I've seen enough ignoramus to smell it when I see it. This is 100% ignoramus.

Its difficult to take someone seriously when they demonstrate in their commentary that they dont understand how the system works.
You cannot use LN without using the blockchain.
Your vision in this is narrow. Bitcoin's selling point is trustlessness and decentralization. Your theory in advocating for central trusted parties to broker asset exchanges on a L2 network?
Uhm....Yea. Not going to happen. Why would anyone do that when they can use paypal or venmo for free?
Even if it did, in your hypothetical, Blockstream would still have to open and close channels on-chain. So, pretty much nope.
@_date: 2017-02-11 16:53:37
You have it backwards. Bitcoin the system is full broadcast and therefore distributed. Mining pools make it decentralized, but if pools didn't exist it would be distributed because it would work the same way as non-mining full nodes currently broadcast.

Yes, a minority has a strong veto power. Unfortunately, this has become the reality of bitcoin, that minority groups can become economically (or politically)incentivized to go against the greater economic interest of the whole. Worst case scenario though it means stalling progress, they dont have the power to change anything.


SW as a hardfork has 0% chance of activating. There are too many rational people within the industry that understand a chain split would be the worst possible outcome for bitcoin. Since the majority know this, the majority understands that the majority will not advocate a HF.
@_date: 2017-03-31 04:41:55


This is the way I interpreted wanting core support.
Also, while a reasonably proficient programmer can audit the code, it does help to have a bird's eye view of the system that only a core Dev could have. Think of it like a auto shop installing a 3rd party part vs a auto engineer doing the inspection. The engineer may find a design flaw in the part from a design perspective that the repair guy might miss. It could be something small that could lead to problems down the road that the repair guy might not understand.
This is why it's good to have reputable individuals do peer review. Not just one of course, but many. Science is all about replication, so we cannot trust one person's word if we are unable to personally verify.

Not quite 1000x, but you do understand that doubling the blocksize does not just double required resources right? This is why so many people like yourself argue the big block side. You don't understand the math or the code and without this knowledge you cannot engage in real game theory. It does not take 1000x to have a broad impact on node count and decentralization. It actually only takes 2x-4x(at most) to eliminate a large % of nodes.
Bitcoins bottleneck is not storage, it's RAM. From the [bitfury whitepaper] ( -




Look at the columns for expected dropoff node %'s as blocksize increases. It's pretty substantial.
You asked for data. There it is.
Now, bandwidth does not grow linearly with blocksize. For every doubling the bandwidth is exponential because the system is broadcast. So a 2mb increase in blocksize *does not* mean a doubling of bandwidth.
You are not taking these considerations into your argument because clearly you did not understand them.
This is the problem with this entire debate. People are using what they perceive as common sense assumptions to counter technical arguments. But if you become academically educated what you will understand from science is that things are not always based in common sense. To fully understand technical arguments you must use an evidence-based approach where you can empirically measure and then react based on those evidence-based measurements.
What's going on every single day in this non-technical discussion that people are engaging in ideological philosophical and non-technical discussion in which they make broad assumptions on what they feel is common sense issues without understanding the data or the evidence.
The BU devs are non-scientific because they do little testing and peer review. Do you really want people who cannot do basic evidence based research controlling Bitcoin? The thought is so insane I wonder every day how there is even a debate.
@_date: 2017-03-23 22:18:46


So there are a few problems with this assumption. Its so riddled with falsehoods that we must attack it from multiple directions to understand just how delusional you are.
First, Lightning Network is a decentralized system. Its not "ran by blockstream" anymore than bitcoin is "ran by satoshi". Hopefully you understand this so far. Im going to try to walk you through this like I would a 4 year old ok?
So blockstream, since they dont "own" or "run" lightning network, they have no means to profit off it anymore than you or I do. They can of course choose to run nodes in LN, the same way that I choose to run nodes in bitcoin. Its a permissionless (mommy does not need to say yes in order for you to do it!) free market (no adults are telling you rules!) system where anyone can participate.
So BlockStream is on a completely equal footing with you and me when it comes to earning money for running a node on LN. This also does not go into the fact that there are other competing implementations of LN, such as Eclair, c-lightning and Thunder, to name a few. These networks will all compete with LN for marketshare, further diluting your conspiracy theory.
The second false assumption you've made here, the one which you stated outright is that miners somehow lose money with L2 networks.
This has been proven to be a false assumption with basic logical proofs. Unfortunately I cannot make this one 4 year old talk for you, you are just going to instead have to read articles with big words and *try your best* to understand them. The truth here is that 2nd layer networks are going to make mining *much much* more profitable. The exact opposite of your false assumption.
The easiest to understand is Rusty's blog -
The much more thorough, but requires more attention and a better-than-a-4-year-old's brain would be Alex B's excellent blog he wrote on the subject here -
After you read all of this, there should be no way for you to squirm out of admitting you are wrong.

Semantics. Those who enforce the rules get to decide what rules they enforce. Dont believe me? Wait for UASF and watch how powerful those miners are when they start crafting blocks that nodes refuse to enforce.




Lets see how long miners continue to mine a worthless shit coin before they switch back to the original chain.
These people are not going to run their miners pointed towards a coin that earns them less than 1/3rd of the $ they could earn pointing it at the old coin. Your entire theory assumes that BU will be profitable or worth more than Core. Good luck with that LOL.
The miners might act stupid at times, but when you put them in a situation where they can choose to mine at a loss vs mine at a profit, you better believe the *majority* of them will mine the coin that is profitable.
There are irrational actors within the system, but fortunately not a majority. This allows for the incentives to balance the system out to the best interests of the majority.

Yes, until that rule was changed, and *consensus was reached* on the change. Once that change was implemented and ran by everyone, including all of the nodes, then that rule *became a NEW consensus rule*.
You are trying to argue that because before the rule was changed that the transactions that come *after* the rule gets un-changed that they are not breaking consensus.
You are ignoring the fact that the consensus rule changed. It needs to be unchanged. Hence *changing the consensus rule*.
Does that make more sense for you? You can use as much semantics as you want but its not going to change *the facts*. The 1MB rule is a consensus rule whether you like it or not. It was implemented and changing it without first reaching network-wide consensus to change it again will simply *fork the network* ......*because* its a change *to a consensus rule*.

Any miner who finds a valid block can create a invalid block and it doesn't matter how many were created before him.
The question is whether it is economically feasible for them to do so. They would obviously lose their block reward, but the question is whether others would build upon it. How cheap is this attack vector?
But just as importantly, how does this scenario differentiate from what we have now?

Unsurprising that 's ego is getting in the way of his rational thinking. Highly ironic considering that is exactly the type of thing he is *trying* to argue against.


That wasn't the point. The point was he lashing out calling someone a FUD engineer when that person is a positive contributor to the code which he reviewed is at absolute best an immature pathetic atttack.
I did not claim you were a authority on anything. But to accuse someone who has empirically contributed positively to something as doing the exact opposite is some pretty extreme stupidity. If someone made the conspiratory claim that you were attempting to "sabotage" it by injecting a backdoor into the code, that would at least be based on some amount of logical constructive thinking, even if it had no foundation. But this? This is not rational constructive thinking at all, its just dumb accusations.

This is a rather disingenuous argument. Bitcoin software is opt-in. If you wish to upgrade the features you may upgrade, and if you dont you may continue to run older versions of the reference client.
By specifically choosing to upgrade your client you are specifically saying "I want these features". This is especially apparent considering these features dont get activated *unless everyone upgrades their client*. There is a circular logic here that you are ignoring.
Upgrading software is the *only* way that users can *signal support*, so to try to spin this as anything other than what it is, signaling support, is like pointing at the sky and saying "Nuh uhhhh, its red not blue!". Or maybe a better example would be buying the new photoshop to do video editing work for your company. It has a bunch of new features that you plan on utilizing that will make life easier. You are basically saying that by purchasing the new software you are doing it "to stay updated" without acknowledging that those features are the very reason you purchased it in the first place. Its so nonsensical that its difficult to put into perspective.
You used to be such a good contributor to this community . I understand that you are divided on an ideological perspective, but that does **not** excuse you for making illogical arguments. If the more intelligent BU supporters like yourself make these obvious faulty-logic statements, it makes us all wonder about the majority of supporters who are obviously not educated. 
Never before has this community felt so strongly like the climate change debate. You have one side filled with academics, research, empirical evidence, and then you have a few naysayers on the other side that relies upon politics, ideological preference and faulty logic to convince the lowest common denominators to side with them. In their hope, they think that if they can gather a large enough crowd, and shout loud enough, that everyone will just decide that the other sides data does not exist.
But thats now how science and engineering works. The data exists and will continue to exist regardless of your ideological preference.

If anything you are the one that objected to my comment with a illogical argument. You used a strawman argument to point out a flaw that never existed, which was trying to move the argument into your court. YOU are guilty of goalpost shifting by creating a argument that was outside the context of the discussion, specifically "SW is not a scaling solution".
Please quote me where I said "SW = Scaling solution" to demonstrate that your retort was within the context of the discussion.
If you cannot then you should logically concede that you engaged in goalpost shifting, not me.

This is also my thought. While belcher may be correct in that there are valid reasons to run a node, those reasons do not apply to the 99% of bitcoin users.
While yes, if we were doing a large transaction to purchase gold, we of course would want to do a counterfeit check......but really who buys large amount of gold on the regular? Thats a very small percentage of the 1% class. Also the people best economically equipped to run a node and to eat the resource cost.
To the average person though? The only reason is altruism and a fascination with bitcoin. Thats why I run mine. Because I believe in decentralization and want to contribute.
This is why LN is such a good idea. It fixes the node incentive issue. This is one of the biggest missing pieces to the bitcoin puzzle and its worth getting it running on that premise alone even if it did not offer massive cost savings.

If you are assuming that LN, side chains, extension blocks wont be utilized, then no. But if you are keeping reality in mind while engaging in game theory on this subject, then yes, it will absolutely hold up in 10 years from now. 
Because SW allows for easier future upgrades. You can do sidechains, extension blocks to increase the blocksize, 2nd layer networks.....everything is possible once SW is activated so yes, it will future proof bitcoin.
The problem is that we have a cabal of chinese miners vetoing the ability to upgrade bitcoin in the future. Instead, they are demanding a small change that opens up a enormous can of worm problems with zero long term benefit. A blocksize increase solves nothing, it merely kicks the can down the road a *few months* at best. 
Thats not a solution, thats a band-aid. Engineers dont put band-aid's on rockets, they engineer long term solutions.
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:11:52
Consensus rules. But it gets complicated because if users don't support the longest chain with new rules then it will eventually collapse with a reorg on the  non rule changing fork, which once again becomes the longest chain.
Which is why it's dangerous to blindly advocate for longest chain under the circumstances.
When miners attempt hostile takeovers the users will punish them.

Thanks for writing this Charlie. You've got the right attitude and we need all the mediators we can get.
Its hard to not attack the people who are literally attacking bitcoin. Hostile takeover attempts are **not cool**. Im specifically talking about Jihan and Roger, who are using their political and economic positions within the community to try to **force** people to choose their vision.
A hard fork is forcing. A softfork enabling opt-in is vanilla mellow British polite person nice non-forcing.
Roger is literally paying people to spread propaganda that's based on lies. This is not an allegation or overstatement. Its common knowledge.
Jihan is the threat we have always been most worried about in bitcoin....miner centralization. He controls multiple pools who's hashrate is way too high for anyone to be comfortable. He has a monopoly on ASIC manufacturing. He is a very serious threat to bitcoins most fundamental property, decentralization. His advocacy for a client which forks the network, is bug riddled and controlled by absolute rookies is a extremely serious threat to bitcoin.

The same argument could be made for a thousand tiny technical mechanics of bitcoin. 
Just because a feature or implementation mechanism is not understood or talked about by the population does not mean that engineers should ignore it or change it.
Your reasoning is unsound.


If you understood the big picture of how bitcoin works, you would understand its importance. Its a very big topic so im not sure where to start. Miner subsidy diminishing and decentralization would be two good starting place, both very large subjects on their own.
Its good to want to try to understand. Its bad to presume that you know the answer. I assure you, you and all the others who engage in ignoring the greater context of the technical details wont get anywhere in terms of understanding until you all accept that you simply dont grasp the bigger picture. Once you do that, humble yourself and *actually try to learn* you'll find with learning comes comprehension.

Your argument demonstrates you dont even understand 10% of how bitcoin works. This is not a single commodity. Its a *system*, a *network*, a *currency/commodity* and a social experiment, just to name a few.
You are engaging in the all-too-common false dichotomy of ignoring all the context and then cherry picking a single narrative to focus on to distract from the real facts. This isn't a apple market that people can speculate on the price of apples without worrying about the destruction of the apple farms. Since bitcoin is a system and network and a industry and a asset, you have to understand how the economics effects all of those things. Whats the point of unleashing the beast if the beast destroys the world? 
You cannot have an exponentially growing system without allocating growing resources. The question is where are these growing resources being upheld by, who?
The key here is to spread them as thinly and evenly as possible across the network so as to not strain its decentralized nature.
What im advocating, which I find really ironic considering your reply, is to *actually* allow a free market to exist to balance the load. We cannot do what you want because it would mean sacrificing bitcoins security. Without that, bitcoin is worthless. 
So yes, you can have what you want and then you can throw a temper tantrum when what you want turns to dust in your hand. Or, you can accept that as things grow resources expand and we must be intelligent about the distribution of those resources or they will cripple the system. You want to make a simple change and just expect everything to work out. Except thats not how life works. There are layers upon layers of interdependencies and if you do not calculate how these things effect each other you are dooming yourself by making hasty decisions.
You think there are simple solutions to complex problems and that shows that you are either a simple person, or you've just not spent the amount of time necessary to understand this **very** complex system.
If you dont think it's a complex system then you are lying to yourself and everyone else.

If you do have a problem with capital based markets, you're definitely in the wrong place, because bitcoin is knee deep in capital markets.

The terms were met by Core. You know who didn't meet the terms though? Miners.....


I like how you forget that part in the agreement. Yes, its the miners who broke the agreement by running non-bitcoin-core compatible consensus software (BU) as was proven already by the recent fork. Clearly its a incompatible consensus software if it forks itself. But yes, tell me all about how you and your cohorts have "kept their end of the bargain" when the evidence demonstrates that is not the case.

This is simply not true.
A Open Source project that is developed by developers in various geolocations around the world most definitely makes the project decentralized.
You can easily prove this to yourself by asking some very simple questions....
1- If github were to burn to the ground today with all its backups, would the bitcoin project die?
2- If Gregory Maxwell or Pieter Wuille (or both consecutively) died  in a car crash today, would bitcoin fail?
The answer is obviously no, which proves that the project is not centralized.
Do not mistake the central location of a github (which is hosted on a decentralized internet hosted across various cloud based backups in different geolocations) as being the central location of a specific open source project.
These are real human beings here that make up this project. You cannot deny that. Just like you cannot deny its real human beings running mining rigs that create the decentralization of the mining infrastructure.
It is these contributory humans, spread across the globe, that makes this project what it is in the first place, and then by the nature of their location decentralized.
If this was "Terminal-Psychosis's Pizza Parlor" where you and your buddies got together and hacked up some php for your businesses website, which was hosted on a server at your pizza parlor, with all of your code sitting on your laptops in the staff room.......that would be a centralized project.
Bitcoin is 100% a decentralized project. You cannot look at that 400+ github contributor list and think that bitcoin would just die if github were to cease to exist. The obvious answer is the developers would just move platforms.
Do not mistake a single platform as encompassing the nature of the entire project. Thats a very small portion of it. github is essentially just the "Microsoft Excel" of development, allowing people to better organize their work. Its not essential to the project and if im not mistaken it didn't even start there? Wasn't the original code hosted somewhere else? I dont think it was sourceforge....but im remembering something in a foggy haze that I can't quite pull out.

Im wondering why you've chosen to ask this question? It seems like its a pre-emptive setup to attack it before the peer review has even been completed.
This is incredibly damaging to the community to have this kind of attitude. 
Most importantly, **anyone** can review it. Core developers have practically begged the community to contribute more peer review. I've seen them ask many many times. There can never be enough and the process is tedious and burdensome, yet extremely important. Developers who are reviewing are spending that time reading and not writing new code, so there must be an appropriate balance met.
Also, lets not forget, most people who attack core attack them for being "too conservative". That would also be reflective in their peer review. That means that the threshold to gain consensus for legitimacy within the bitcoin peer review process is *harder*, not easier. 
As we have seen demonstrated already, BU does not even review their code before pushing it live. Core has the opposite problem, if you could call it a problem.

You are just parroting the same mistakes that I've been forced to counter a million times. We cannot agree to a hardfork so what you want is unrealistic and impossible to achieve. Even if we could just hardfork to 4MB it **does not fix the problem**.
Kicking the can down the road is not a solution, thats a bubblegum patch.
Real professionals engineer solutions instead of stuffing bubblegum in the hole on the ship. You are advocating a rookie solution to a highly complex problem, and the reason you are advocating this *is because you do not understand this system.*. Its no wonder you disagree with me....you are not educated on the facts. You are engaging in the all too common false dichotomy of ignoring the middle ground. Sure, lets hardfork! Except we cant. Sure lets raise the BS to 4MB! Except that opens up cpu ddos attack vectors with a appropriate fix (hint: thats one of SW's many benefits). 


Huh? I dont think you know what you are talking about. People who are holding bitcoins are not generating transactions. They have no impact on blocksize unless they are trying to move their coins. If they are going to move their coins its going to a take a one time transaction to do so...but this is all besides the point because holders dont *need* to xfer their coins to SW compatible addresses.
SW is opt-in. Holders can continue to use old P2PKH addresses if they desire. There is no reason for them to move their coins unless they want to spend them or put them on a payment channel. It will not take "years"....it will take 1 single block confirmation should they wish to move their coins and pay the appropriate fee and even then its opt-in and not a requirement and therefore has no impact upon blocksize.


You started off this sentence by creating a red herring. So because "it has failed" then we should just give up on decentralization?
People like you are incoherent, irrational and uneducated. You clearly dont even know what you are talking about and yet here you are on reddit trying to assert that you know best.
Its nice to have an opinion dude. But its not nice to pretend that you know whats best when you have demonstrated you dont even understand the basics of bitcoin.
Its ok to not be educated. I was pretty clueless for a long time and it took a lot of reading and posting here to get me up to speed.
But I wasn't going around posting telling other users here that they were wrong. Instead I was asking questions and seeking to understand.
You should be asking more questions instead of asserting your ignorance. You are a living dunning-kruger. Just please ask more questions instead of making assumptions on things you shouldn't have any confidence in because you literally dont know the answers to bitcoin101 stuff.

@_date: 2017-03-19 01:51:20


I explained it in my post. But to expand for your understanding the reason is because they have proposed "simple solutions" to complex problems and the more gullible (aka less intelligent) miners have took the bait line and hook. Also remember that miner centralization is the largest threat bitcoin faces. We've always known this and this has never changed. So when you convince literally **one person** (Jihan) to follow your ideological perspective, then that one person, who manufacturers 75% of all ASIC's has a serious ability to influence miners. Especially since that person is Chinese, *most miners are chinese* and Chinese are extremely ....well, I'll just quote my friend (who is a scientist by profession) which was discussing the upcoming raping of the US science funding budget, and how not much of the international science arm has not swooped up yet on the pool of talent...
"There is still a strong sense of Chinese ethnic exceptionalism among Chinese"
This basically means that Chinese people are much more likely to side with Chinese people. This is a known cultural artifact with the Chinese. So on top of a single person in a position of serious-bitcoin-threatening control, who has a cultural heritage advantage on top of his power advantage, advocates for people to do a specific thing.....well...I think you can see where this is going. People are tribal and they love to follow people they love. Chinese people love Money and success and power just like everyone else, so when a prominent figure in the Chinese industry uses propaganda....people are much more likely to listen to him and his arguments regardless of whether or not they are irrational. And at first glance the arguments *appear to be logical*. This is why I went into so much detail in my post, because as science has demonstrated endlessly, there are often not simple or straight forward answers to problems. Sometimes you have to train yourself against your own bias to truly understand something because the answer appears to be wrong. But once you eliminate bias, gather all of the data and sort it, you'll understand that the answer, which appeared to be strange/wrong, is actually right. And the "simple answer" that you thought was right? Well turns out that was just entirely wrong. There are often not simple solutions to complex problems!
If you *really* want to understand this, I created a rather thorough post that discusses the science behind this psychology [here]( It should adequately explain why and how people respond this way.
I also hope you don't think that money equates to intelligence? Just because you have money does not make you smart. Plenty of miners are stupid. 
For example, the *majority* of American's have a lower median IQ comparatively to the rest of the developed world. That means that the *majority* of American's are ...well....kinda *dumb*. I say this as an American representing America, with full disclosure of my peers lacking in the cognitive department.
Is it so ridiculous to assume that there is an even mix of intelligence across the bitcoin industry? Or any industry?
Every industry is filled with bright people and morons. Whether you have money or not does not automatically equate to intelligence. In fact, it more often is equated with social or cultural opportunity, meaning *where you were born* and the type of family you were born into.


Actually, no its not. Those are real numbers. Do the math yourself. Core has hundreds of contributors to its open source project. BU has only a handful. Thats 99% to 1%. Worst case its 98 to 2%. Even if it was 95% to 5% my point would still be entirely valid.


Right, before the scientific method was created and before the age of enlightenment. 
Your example is entirely illogical. Its like going to the special Olympics and saying "See all these people? Yea, I bet none of them could beat me at a IQ test!". You are cherry picking a purposefully olden time where there was no science, no real methodology to knowledge, there was very little written information available, there was no schooling *at all* (other than for aristocrats to study aristocracy) ...
Seems like you are representative of the BU people with typically horrible faulty logic and assumptions over data.

Again. Since you missed it before. If github were to burn down today, would it stop bitcoin core from releasing code? No? Ok. You have your answer. If you dont have the answer then you are hopeless.


Core dev's dont have control over who runs the code. What you are suggesting is that miners get to dicate the rules of bitcoin. What you are failing to understand is that *core devs dont get to decide the rules, users do*. Users do by running nodes and contributing to the economy.
All you've done is again, for the *nth* time, is demonstrate you dont understand how bitcoin works.


Yes, and this is a problem. Satoshi talked about this. As I said before, satoshi was *mostly right* and he had the system's incentives down pretty good. One of the things he talked about was rule enforcement. He discussed how nodes needed to have the same rules ran by compatible clients or it would "wreak havoc on the network".
Because when you allow humans to configure consensus rules willy-nilly, you will end up with endless bitcoin forks.
You've already demonstrated you dont understand how bitcoin works thoroughly. Do you really expect me to believe you considering how much ignorance you've exposed?
Its no wonder you dont understand how incredibly bad giving humans the ability to independently configure consensus rules. This seriously breaks bitcoin.
But you are too ignorant to understand this. Its not a character attack....this is a statement of factually obvious reasoning, based on the ignorance of your posts.

Yes, and when you chose to become a part of facebook in the first few years it was cool right? And then your sister got on. And then your mom got on, and then finally your grandma got on.
Arguably the facebook network is worth *much more* with all these users, yet you cannot use it the same way because its not "cool" anymore, the dynamics have changed.
The same analogy applies to burningman.
Listen, life does not exist in a stasis for you. You, life, everything....it all evolves constantly. Expecting things to "stay the same" is called "being delusional". Its not going to happen and you need to learn to deal with it.
Just because you didn't understand that bitcoin could not remain cheap on the base layer forever doesn't mean that it was "always meant to be that way" ....that just means that you didn't do your homework on the subject.
Seriously...how did you expect bitcoin to pay for its security when the block reward diminished? Magic?
Your argument is not founded in any logical basis. You acknowledge that things have changed but basically just say "im not ok with it" ....yea well, thats life. Things change and you have to learn to deal with it.

Uhm, no. They crafted an invalid block. What looneybin are you getting your information from? They lost their reward because they did not construct a valid block. It was the fault of their software (BU) that caused them to construct an invalid block with a correct solution.
Fortunately, no other miners tried to build upon it or we would have seen greater losses, which is exactly what will occur with emergent consensus.
If you cannot get basic facts straight its impossible to have a conversation. When you understand the above, let me know and we can continue.

I think you might be jumping down the throat of a person who's actually supporting you. He's merely saying its the users who decide what bitcoin is, and he's right.
You can fork, and if the users behind the bitcoin network decide to value your forked coin higher than the previously incumbent coin then your new fork coin becomes bitcoin. By users I mean everyone. Exchanges, economic nodes, full nodes, miners etc.
The ford/chevy analogy doesn't translate well at all because of legal ownership, laws, etc. Bitcoin is a totally different thing.
If everyone decided Chevy is now Ford, well then for all intents and purposes Chevy is Ford (in the bitcoin world).
@_date: 2016-03-05 22:25:08


Thats a rather narrow and *temporary* perspective. Obviously the much higher point of view is that blockspace is artificially constrained through central planning actors (core), and that such a broad sweeping analysis of the situation is nullified when you take into account that blockspace was never meant to be constrained in the first place.
You can argue the merits of constraining it all day, but it does not change the fact that it *was* artificially constrained and it was *that constraining* that has lead to your interpretation of this situation.
If you go back 12 months, you'll notice that your interpretation is no longer valid. So long as there is not a constrained blockspace, then there is no broad definition of "legitimate use cases" as all transactions were welcome, even those who contained no fee.

There is no implication needed. They lost it. Thats not a matter for discussion, thats a fact.

Yes, that would be my position. Its much more important to appropriately test your products before going to market to catch any flaws of workmanship before it hits the public market. If you are always chasing bugs in the rear thats called being a rookie. We dont want rookies in charge of bitcoin.

It absolutely *is semantics* when you are saying changing 1mb is "not changing a consensus rule because "reasons"", when the evidence directly shows that changing the 1mb rule absolutely is a consensus rule change.
You constantly confuse issues.


That soft fork when it was adoped by **everyone** *changed the consensus rule*.
If you want to change it again, then you need to *change the consensus rule*. If BU wants to make it "user configurable" then they can go ahead and try to do so, but you need to stop pretending that it doesn't change a consensus rule.

Bitcoin is open source. Anyone can "come back" at anytime by submitting code for peer review.
The reason Gavin does not participate socially is because he has been mostly ostracized by the community for his many mistakes of very large caliber. [Advocating for centralization]( of bitcoins security), programming and trying to fork bitcoin via a alternative client despite [warning people on bitcointalk about the threat that someone would "co-opt bitcoin" by doing exactly that]( He did so with Mike Hearn who even the most irrational big blockers cannot deny was bad for Bitcoin after he left it to literally go work with bankers *against* Bitcoin and wrote a ragequit shitpost where he said Bitcoin failed, [and Gavin even agreed with Bram Cohen's "whiney ragequit" sentiment]( And the whole Craig Wright fiasco.....What a nightmare that was.
I like Gavin as a person he seems to believe the best in people. I want Gavin to be my kids baseball coach where there are no stakes and his naivety serves a positive purpose.
But I want Gavin no where near the reins of Bitcoin. How many major mistakes do you need to make at your job before you get fired? Usually 2 will get your fate sealed. Gavin has made so many crucial management decisions that were complete failures he should have been fired long before he was. The community voted against his opinion by deciding to run core instead of forking to XT. That was when the economy fired Gavin, or maybe more accurately Gavin actually fired himself.
If you decide to quit your job to go work for another company to compete against your former company, and then try your hardest to destroy your former company do you really think that the people involved with your former company being staff employees or customers would really want to work with you after such damaging decisions?
That's what Gavin did.
Gavin needs to get off Twitter and realize that all he is doing at this point is dividing Bitcoin by being a salty dick who cannot accept he fired himself and is fucking things up for the people who stuck with the good guys and worked hard to prevent the centralized mess that Gavin advocated for.
Basically Gavin went the lazy route because he was incapable of going the long hard but necessary route. You can sacrifice the security on layer 2 all you want, but **do not fuck with bitcoins security**. Gavin wanted to shoulder the cost on a few instead of putting the time in to distribute the burden across many.

Expecting others to "honor" their part of the agreement when you (maybe not you specifically, but a large % of miners) have dishonored the agreement is not a rational conclusion.
Are miners special? Do they get to shit on some parts of the agreement because they are special, while others have to follow every line exactly?

You really dont understand how open source works? 
No. A decentralized group of **open source** developers working on a **open source** project is not "centralized". You are thinking of a **closed** source project. You know this to be true because if 50% of developers were on a plane and it crashed then the project would move on. It would move on specifically because of its distributed open source nature. Distributed &gt; decentralized.


You've yet to admit that consensus rules were changed with the 1mb limit. Once you accept this fact then we can move onto the next logical fact. You know this to be true because after the limit was put in place if anyone tried to create a block above that limit then they would fork. Thats how you **know for a fact** its a consensus rule.

While this is a step in the right direction does anyone think that this will resolve the nature of the problem?
Companies have culture. This culture is built by the actions taken by the leaders of the company over time. Are we really supposed to believe that this company who has a history of selling software to authoritarian regimes and dictators to Target journalist and civilians is going to be filled with nice people who will never ever do anything wrong now that that head of the beast is cut off?
Even just working at this company makes you suspect. When the leaders of an organization have a poor moral compass you can be sure that those employees who stayed with a company will retain some of that reek.
Undoubtedly there are good people that work there that didn't agree with some of the actions and just wanted to make a paycheck..... But isn't the fact that they stayed for money all while engaging in unethical actions proof enough that these people don't belong in a industry devoted to liberty and sovereignty?
I think the only right decision at this point is to sink the ship. The hull is rotten and the rest of the ship rotting. Trying to pick and choose who has a moral compass within a company with a history of unsavory actions is a untenable situation.
By sink the ship I mean forgo the purchase of neutrino. But honestly I would be just as happy if coinbase sunk as well. We didn't sign up for the ideology of decentralized peer-to-peer money to replace it with large centrist organizations. Coinbase is just another bank pandering to bitcoiners that they are somehow different. Trust me they are not different. They're built with the same types of banking investment firms whose values are prioritize to investors and board members and profit and not individual liberty and financial sovereignty. Of course they will tell you otherwise but actions speak louder than words. Mere existence is proof enough.

This is disillusionment. There is no discontent between the people who *do* understand bitcoin. There is overarching consensus amongst both the experts within the field and the educated majority.
What you are seeing is a *very small* but **very loud** minority of bitcoin users who inherently dont understand how bitcoin works, or wishes it to work in favor of their ideological perspective.
The same people that I see participate here on this sub that are constantly attacking progress are the same ones I and others of this subreddit correct constantly. They continue to spout their misinformation and illogical reasoning despite being corrected ad infinitum.
What you are seeing is loud annoying trolls who either purposefully or naively misunderstand bitcoin and shouting their opinions at others.
Even the "big blocker" developers like Gavin and Garzik admit that SW is a good solution. Its only people we dont know, who are completely new to bitcoin development (such as the BU "team" - aka basically 2 guys) that have demonstrated quite obviously now that they are incapable of writing good code due to the number of very serious and very large public bugs that their releases have been subject to. Which is to not even talk about the several even more serious bugs that have been submitted in private from the **real** bitcoin developers to the BU team. nullc has stated that the BU team has not even fixed the bugs that they previously submitted, so that should give you a good idea on who the "experts" are and who are not.
The only reason that I personally have clear vision is because I've decided to devote several hours a day, every day, to bitcoin. This has been ongoing for about 4 years now for me. 
Now take the above paragraph and realize that *I am not a expert*. I've spent 4 years studying bitcoin daily and I still am no where near expert level. My prior 15 years of IT experience with an emphasis on networking has given me a better birds eye view of the system than non-technical-experienced folks, but still does not allow me to glean all the truth behind the fog of bitcoin.
There are very few real experts in bitcoin. I would say less than 20 and **all** of them are working on core, or projects directly linked to core.
Whats important here is to be an intelligent human being. Intelligent human beings understand that they are not experts at a field that they have not practiced as a profession for a many number of years, or studied academically for *at least* 6 years.
So if you are not a expert, and you know you're not a expert, how can you go about understanding whats going on?
The answer is simple -
You listen to **experts**. 
Experts reached consensus on the path forward years ago and [published it for everyone to see](
99% of bitcoin developers reached consensus on SegWit as being the best path forward for bitcoin.
To argue "I trust the 1% and think the 99% are wrong" is a blatant act of *stupidity*. By doing so you are admitting that you are not an expert, that you are not qualified to judge the technicalities, and therefore you must resign your judgment to others. But instead of being totally reasonable and using common sense of trusting the almost 100% complete majority, you want to stick your neck out and trust 1%.
When you put it in perspective, it seems *fucking crazy* right?
It is. Those are the people who you see arguing against the educated majority who has reached consensus.
But here's the logic problem, the big sore thumb that sticks out you might say. HOW. How has BU gotten so much mining support for something that is against experts consensus?
The answer is through disillusionment. BU has advocated for a "trivial fix" to a **highly complex problem**.
BU is basically advertising snake oil as a charm. They are saying "This is a easy fix! All we have to do is raise the blocksize to 2MB! Problem solved!"
But this is a false dichotomy. When you raise the blocksize from 1MB to 2MB you dont just double the resources. Storage will double sure...but storage is literally the cheapest resource in bitcoin. Its easy to double your harddrive space. But how easy and cheap is it to *quadruple* your RAM? 
By raising the blocksize to 2MB you are making a tradeoff. You are saying "I want to reduce the impact of transaction cost on users, but in order to do so im pushing the cost onto node operators". Everything in every system has a cost/benefit relationship. So when you make a change you *must* address how that change impacts the system.
Nodes are the only thing keeping bitcoin from becoming Paypal. So when you increase resources you must study the impact that a resource increase will have upon the nodes that make the system operate.
Well it just so happens the [is a white paper that discusses the impact of additional resources upon nodes](
In that table on page 4, you can see it estimates a 40% drop immediately in node count with a 2MB upgrade and a 50% over 6 months. At 4mb, it becomes 75% immediately and 80% over 6 months. At 8, it becomes 90% and 95%.
The reason for this drastic impact?


What BU is not telling you is that when the blockchain is running at 2MB full that we will lose **60%** of the node count within 6 months.
What the paper is not telling you is that 60% of those nodes are the nodes that are actually most valuable to the network. Those are the low resource nodes that are being ran by people like **me**. People who are running a node alturistically on their home ISP connection. Thats *real decentralization*. 
Whats left are high resource nodes which are typically operated in data centers.
What happens when all of your nodes are operating in data centers?
They become incredibly fragile due to the fact that they are now **centralized** instead of *decentralized*.
If you have 2000 nodes spread across 50 data centers, thats literally 50 computers that a state actor has to attack to *completely cripple bitcoin*. You dont think this is a realistic threat? Then you dont understand what bitcoin was created for. It was created to be a censorship-resistent immutable form of money. It *cannot* retain those properties if we have nodes operating just in data centers.
In this, Satoshi was clearly wrong. Anyone with a reasonable amount of white hat, black hat or distributed systems experience will be able to tell you a centralized network is orders of magnitude easier to attack than decentralized.
Bitcoin was intended to be the bittorrent of money, not the paypal of money. Paypal already exists and it works great. If you want cheap fast and easy, use it! If you want money that your government cannot confiscate in the form of inflation, hyperinflation or outright theft (See India banknote situation) then you want a decentralized attack resistent network.
As you can see, the situation is not simple. They want you to think its simple because they (non-core developers) are either naive/ignorant to the *real* problems, or (more likely) that they are driven by ego or ideological preference as opposed to rational thinking. 
SegWit solves ALL of the problems with a non-trivial but elegant fix. It solves malleability, it opens the doors to lightning network type systems that will compete in a open market. Those systems financially incentivize their nodes to upkeep the network, which is what bitcoin is missing! So many people dont understand this. LN fixes the node incentive structure that bitcoin is missing.
Beyond that it creates better aligned economic incentives for UTXO, which *lowers fee's*. Its a *real blocksize increase to 2MB* where its a single container that will hold more transactions, both the old non-SW style transactions and the new SW style transactions.
Further, it enables more advancements like MAST and Schnorr, which will *further* optimize on-chain bitcoin transactions, developments that have been on the roadmap for *years* yet we always hear the same lies that "core is trying to force 2nd layer networks to "take over" bitcoin!".
The truth is the situation is highly complex and you do need years of hardcore study and a technical background to understand **all** of the dynamics.
If you dont understand the system as a whole, and how it interacts with all the pieces, then you cannot make changes to the system because you dont understand the cost/benefit relationship.
Core clearly understands that cost/benefit relationship and are trying to be responsible stewards of the network. They are trying to implement "opt-in" upgrades that gives everyone the choice to continue using bitcoin the way it always worked (if you are stuck in your ideologies) or to use it in the new better-economically-incentivized ways that will make your transactions cheaper, faster and add more blockspace.
When you are in full knowledge of the facts, the situation is *crystal clear*. I understand the system enough to counter all of the uninformed trolls on this sub trying to spread their *gospel*. Make no mistake, its gospel. Its not data, its not facts. Its lies. Its lies that try to appeal to  "logic" thats illogical once you know **all** the facts.
Dont be deceived,  listen to experts when they reach consensus. Dont ignore them. Doing so is at your and the whole networks peril. We are seeing this with global warming and we are seeing the same in bitcoin. BU = Republicans engaging in misinformation and doubt propaganda on climate.

When you have a decentralized body of developers contributing to a open source project, sure, yea, the power balance is there.
When you have pretty much a single developer (Andrew Stone) doing the majority of work?
And how about satoshi? When satoshi was around, was he not "in charge of bitcoin" ?
I would argue that satoshi had 100% control over bitcoin. I would argue even later after he left, when there was still no major factions, that even Gavin was in control of bitcoin.
the point here is not to dismiss you, but to make you think about the dynamics of the situation to realize that its not black and white, and its not apples to apples either.

Is he supposed to convince people to his side by taking both sides? We have a phrase for that in politics, and its called "lip service". Are you saying he's giving lip service, or are you claiming that he is "evolving on his ideas" .....?
I can think of other people who have "evolved on their ideas"....like Gavin ["SOMEBODY will try to mess up the network (or co-opt it for their own use) sooner or later. They'll either hack the existing code or write their own version, and will be a menace to the network."](
Jihan ["Centralised hash power means the blockchain is controlled by small number of people."](

At current limitations, I do not believe so because if the userbase and blocksize was suddenly doubled we would be in the same exact position as today. That is however a very philosophical question and not rooted in realistic adoption metrics, so that would not likely happen. Garzik refers to this phenomena as the *fidelity effect*, speculating that fidelity wants to use the bitcoin blockchain but cannot because of capacity issues. However im not fully sold that fidelity is really ready to take everything online and that their usage would suddenly be so massive that it would require more-than-doubling of the blocksize limit.
I would think their services would have a spin up period, where they would slowly bring services online and transaction counts would steadily rise, though perhaps much quicker than the current rise of transactional volume.
But doubling the blocksize would allow for a less than doubling of the userbase, at current volume needs.

Are the people making the transactions not real people? How are those who are bidding for blockspace in a free market "artificial" ?
Yes yes, I know, tell me all about the "self imposed blocksize" and "satoshi said".
Yet, even the most ardent big blocker must face the facts. Bitcoin is 100x bigger today than it was when you could get your starbucks and pizza for free. Do you think that a network can increase by orders of magnitude without a distribution of costs?
And where do we propose to distribute those costs? Should we distribute those costs on the people who have chosen to keep bitcoin's most fundamental and valuable property, censorship-resistence/immutability.... by running a node, [with the full knowledge that research shows even a minor increase in resources would eliminate a large % of them](
Or should we keep security at the base layer in tact as much as possible and distribute those costs to a 2nd layer that can incentivize its nodes economically so that they can actually shoulder the burden of the network?
When you understand the bigger picture here you can clearly see which action is irresponsible and harms bitcoin and which one has a  much more clear path of survival and continuance of a health network.
 
You either want a decentralized bitcoin, or you want paypal. Choose one.

This is semantics and distracts from what we are discussing. A hard fork does not *need* any percent of any amount of support to be defined as a hard fork.
A hard fork is a software revision that has a consensus changing rule. XT, Classic, BU ...all of these are attempts at hard forks. The activation threshold does not change the definition other than to add a adjective to it, such as "contentious" hard fork.
If we are going to say "hard fork" we should mean "hard fork" and not "contentious hard fork" or "non-contentious hard fork".
Words mean things. We should use them correctly.

Falk has proven to not be very intellectually invested into Bitcoin. He clearly supports it for his political ideology, which is great, except that he advocates for the thing that will eliminate the properties that makes Bitcoin the thing he wants for his political ideology.

He should invest more time to research the issue instead of blathering on Twitter about a debate he's not researched on.

Yes, I shouldn't have made the assertion that just because you evolve that your a hypocrite. That was not my intention. My intention was to draw attention to those central figures within the bitcoin community who absolutely have demonstrated hypocrisy by doing the exact opposite of things they once acknowledged were very bad idea's.
A lot of people have shifted on a lot of positions as more data becomes available. This of course is not bad and is the foundation of good reasoning.
One must not confuse "being open minded" with "attacking the network".
Advocating for things like a contentious hard fork, 51% attacking the minority chain (or the "original consensus chain" if we want to be more technically correct) .....these are not "open minded" actions.
Those are the actions of a malcious actor who should be treated with hostility until they can prove well beyond a reasonable doubt that they are non-hostile entities.
You seem to forget how bitcoin works. We all play by the same rules and as long as we do that, then everything is ok. When we try to draw lines in the sandbox, and say "Jimmy's rules only on this swing set" ....thats jimmy trying to *steal* a portion of the playground for his own personal use against the best interests of the community. It does not matter how self righteous jimmy is, or how popular jimmy is, or how "right" jimmy thinks he is.
Fuck jimmy, im not going to sit around picking my nose on the monkey bars while that dipshit attempts to steal the resources of our playground against the majority's best interest.
No, the majority needs to make it clear that if jimmy attempts to attack us by throwing sand at us so that we cannot enjoy the rest of our playground that he's going to get beat up and have all of his lunch money stolen. When it comes to lunch time and Jimmy wants to trade his pokemon cards for lunch, he's gonna get laughed at and starve instead.

Yes, it does. UTXO is going to exponentially grow regardless of whether we leave as-is or even if we activate SW. SW re-aligns economic incentives for UTXO so that you make smarter choices (Because its cheaper). This reduces UTXO bloat and reduces memory usage.

I've seen it. I think that it ignores the reality that bitcoin faces.
Society has demonstrated ad infinitum that if you allow people to decide the costs of things, they will vote the costs down until society buckles. We've seen this a million times before where the public gets to directly vote on spending. The public always votes to spend more than the state can afford, leaving the state crippled with debt.
The same thing will occur with bitcoin. If you unbound the blockspace, and allow people to vote with their wallets as to what the fee's will be, then fee's will remain low. 
That system is not sustainable **long term**.
That is the problem with Peter R's proposals. They do not take into account the fact that miners must make up in fee's for what they lose in block subsidy, nor do they account for increased resource cost of network operations.
His proposal would work short term. But after 10-15 years hashrate would decrease to the point that it would threaten bitcoins PoW security, and long long long before 10-15 years we would see node rate fall off the charts. Read [this]( to understand the details.
We cannot implement a major change to bitcoin without understanding long term cause and effect. Peter's system would do the opposite of what we want. Instead of creating greater economic incentives for miners to secure the blockchain we would be diminishing them.
Someone has to pay for bitcoin. You want a swiss bank account in your pocket? Then *you* have to pay for that swiss bank account. You cannot expect others to burden the cost for you.
All this is, is redistributing the costs of the network onto the users who cannot sustain those costs.
It ignores the impact that a unbounded blocksize has on node operators. We have a down curve of node operators and things have not panned out like we hoped with businesses running nodes. This means that bitcoins decentralized system is in threat of becoming centralized.
Any change that causes centralization and diminishes decentralization must be fought.
Peter R's proposals do this. It is a typical false dichotomy. It cherry picks one aspect and then ignores all the rest of the cause and effect.

When bitcoin did not have the userbase that it does now, when bitcoin had double to quadruple the block reward it does not have now.....
Then you could have free or near free transactions.
By making the claim that because there is a fee associated with using a payment network, that the currency upon that network is not currency....
Well that just sounds like you dont have any idea what you are talking about. It seems like you've not thought this through at all, that you've spent literally no amount of time at all even to wonder **really basic questions like** "how does a decentralized payment network pay for the costs required to secure it"?
You are ignoring all of the facts that exist today. Bitcoin today is not what it was 5 years ago. Bitcoin today has 1000x the userbase and 1/4th the block reward.

Thats right. When you are not an expert in a field you dont have the mental capacity to make valid decisions on highly technical issues. If you are intelligent, you defer your opinion to the consensus reached by experts on the issue through peer review processes.
Im not saying "Dont do your own thinking" ...im saying when you are incapable of doing your own thinking because you lack expertise in a field, its best to leave the discussion to people who actually *are educated* on the topic. Dont make assumptions on information you know nothing about. That's an indication of stupidity.
Lets say you walk into a science lab and a scientist tells you why a particular molecule is able to latch onto to a specific organism to cross the brain blood barrier. Since you are not a microbiologist, do you look at the scientist and say "Durr dur derpa dur, UR WRONG DERPA!"
Or do you stfu and listen to the real experts who have actually spent their lifetimes studying incredibly complex things do their incredibly hard work tell you their findings?

Bitcoin is not a centralized service like eBay. When they are competing for market share they can make listings for free because they are generating Revenue off of advertisement or they are doing it as a loss leader to gain market share so that they then can raise fees on their vendors at a later time once they have monopolized the industry. They will recoup costs and to think otherwise is naive.
This cannot happen with Bitcoin. The resources that cost individuals money to host the blockchain and propagate transactions and to validate blocks cannot just be magically taken away. There is no Central Authority that controls them to give them money to compensate them for their lost leader like Behavior. Miners are only one part of the picture. 
All this does is further demonstrate that Jihan clearly doesn't understand how Bitcoin works in the business world. He may be used to running businesses based on centralized decision-making models which is why he would so greatly advocate for BU which will cause Bitcoin to be turned into a centralized decision making model.
He has clearly demonstrated that he does not understand the complexity of the cost-benefit relationship of transactions and Resource Management in a decentralized system.
Thanks so is mediocracy. This is appointing the least qualified person to make management decisions. Thanks so is like saying "he is a successful businessman. He will run things better!"
But bitcoin, like government, is not a business. It's a decentralized network that requires complex tradeoffs to work. There is no dictator that gets to make rules. Someone who is used to throwing his ego around to get shit done is the least effective person for the job.
Jihan is clearly on a Jihad to destroy Bitcoin.

Actually, both of these align perfectly. But sometimes you cannot teach dumb people to not vote against their own interests.
The interest of security is best met with miner support. Miner support is best aligned with economic interest, which the current SW + LN option offers **by far** the most optimal situation.
I dont see where the hangup is here. I just see one single **cabal** of miners from China spearheaded by Jihan into believing something thats simply not true. 
Jihan obviously lacks knowledge on the subject. He's demonstrated his inability to see details and have foresight. Why would people listen to him? Because he has money/power? Thats the *only* reason and its a *stupid reason* to listen to someone, especially on technical issues that are over the head of the person they are seeking advice from.

I would agree but I would tend to think that a smart businessman does not just utilize one tool in his toolset. When you have that much money and this much power as a political figure within a industry, it becomes *very easy* to use that position to cause turmoil within the market.
Bitcoin is still small enough that single individuals like Jihan can make a big impact. Especially since he makes all the shovels.
I dont think its unrealistic at all to think that he is using his position of power to economically gain. As someone who makes and sells ASICs, we dont even know that Jihan is a BTC holder. For all we know he keeps 100% of his assets in ¥ and nothing in BTC. 
Is it a theory? Yea, sure. Is it unfounded? Of course. But is it conspiratorial? No....this is par for the course for big players. This is  standard behavior. Its not very conspiratorial to short a market or to buy a competitive asset as hedging. That doesn't make it true, but it doesn't make it conspiratorial either.

Only by Luke's definition. Luke has strange definitions for things. I think *literally everyone else* concedes that consensus is usually near-100% but does not *have* to be 100% in order to be achieved. See climate change debate for best example.
Having the opinion that "if we cannot have perfect agreement we cannot move forward" is an insane policy that only cognitively disabled person would adhere to. Humans are diverse and there is rarely 100% agreement on *anything*, let alone complicated matters.
This is why we establish systems to overcome these difficulties.
With that said, I think the issue here is it will be difficult to find consensus broadly across the developer ecosystem for a 2MB HF considering we have a 2-4MB SF pending and ready for activation that accomplishes the same goal and goes about it in a much more intelligent and efficient way. It adds much more total capacity than a 2MB HF when you calculate SW styled transactions and a 4MB max blocksize. Its a lot more than a doubling of current capacity, which is the maximum you could say for a 2MB HF.
When you compare the differences between SW vs 2MB HF, you'll notice that SW gets *a lot more done*. So merely on a technical level we have consensus across the broad developer ecosystem to get it activated and used. Its a 99% consensus, which I think is the best we will ever get on any technical upgrade.
When you look at it from this perspective, you'll come to realize that the only reason to "do it the other way" is purely for ideologically driven reasons. If developers concede to ideologically driven compromises, then bitcoin is essentially dead. Not now, but it sets a precedent that factions can strong arm developers into non-technical decisions. This would sabotage bitcoin for its lifetime.
Developers must make technical decisions based on technicalities.

Yes, it allows a majority of *miners* to make that decision.
I understand that you have put safeguards into your system, but your system still delegates the responsibility to miners to make that decision. This means that one single faction within bitcoin can collude to orchestrate changes at no cost other than social cost.
The problem is we have one single chinese guy making 75% of all the ASICs and using politics and chinese heritage to strong arm chinese miners into doing his bidding.
You cannot remove the centralization threat from bitcoin, you can *only make it worse* by advocating giving more control to miners.
 &gt;The balance comes because miners, just like users, have shown they can't agree on anything.
This is a very large assumption and you have no idea how the future is going to play out. For all you know bitfury will go out of business, McAffee's investment with Jihan will lead to 95% of hashing being controlled by a central entity, and then you've gone and handed them even more power with this system.
I dont think you've applied proper game theory to your proposal. The risks are simply too high to give miners any more power without adding financial penalties to counter balance the additional power gains.
nullc's difficulty adjustment proposal is the absolute minimum needed for giving miners more power, and even then im wary about the extra rule making abilities we are giving them.
You need a better counterbalance to their power, and it needs to be present so that even in the circumstance of hashpower collusion it still protects.
This may not be possible, which is why I think the idea does not work. Thats not fault of your own, but we cannot implement something that has such big questions left unanswered.

Now, we get to what I see as the meat and potato's of the issue. People are now ideologically divided into factions and evidence based research is no longer effective against ideologically driven agendas. To understand this better....


The paper goes into an illustrative example to explain this...its long, but well worth the read to understanding this phenomenon. 


truth statements involved in the decision to invade Iraq may be understood. During the period
1992 to 2002, U.S. public opinion polls indicated  that a slight majority supported an invasion of
Iraq, and that a strong majority favored waiting for the conclusion of UN inspections on the status
of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction (19–22). In January 2003, President Bush’s State of the Union address included a threat assessment of Iraq’s weapons and intentions. He stated, “We will consult, but let there be no misunderstanding: If Saddam Hussein does not fully disarm for the safety of our people, and for the peace of the world, we will lead a coalition to disarm him.” In February 2003, Colin Powell, the highly respected U.S. Secretary of State and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke to the UN Security Council. Polling just prior to the speech indicated that a strong majority of the public viewed Powell’s forthcoming speech as an important factor in settling their minds about an attack on Iraq (23). The speech (24) presented a logic structure on three truth statements:


of weapons of mass destruction.


mass destruction are real and present dangers
to the region and to the world.


would be a just war.


public and announced Operation Iraqi Freedom. He stated, “The people of the United States and our friends and allies will not live at the mercy of an outlaw regime that threatens the peace with weapons of mass murder.” The 2003 invasion of Iraq began a few days later. In the immediate March-May aftermath of the invasion, polling indicated a surge to strong majority support of the preemptive invasion. With the failure to find any evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, polling indicated that a strong majority of the public believed that the
Iraq War was based on incorrect assumptions (25). In September 2005, Colin Powell acknowledged that his UN speech was based on flawed intelligence reports.


This should help demonstrate what has been going on in our community. A common example of this is centralization effects.
The BU - r/btc side will be seen constantly arguing against the logic of centralization effects. [As I have already explained]( the [research]( on the issue of node impact on blocksize increases is substantial and measurable. We know that as we increase blocksize, not all of the resources required scale linearly. Some do, and some dont. Most importantly, UTXO growth and its impact upon RAM, bitcoin nodes greatest bottleneck, is the most concerning factor.
The other side will constantly talk about moore's law, storage costs, etc, but completely ignore the fact that it is RAM, not storage that is the bottleneck. Since they do not understand the highly complex relationship of UTXO growth and memory usage, they cannot reason out how this negative impacts node count and centralization.
As I quoted earlier from that wonderful national geographic article....


This is perpetually put on display here. Because the non-technical cannot understand UTXO growth and since there is not clear simple data on how this impacts memory, it is impossible for non-technical users to use "common sense" reasoning to evaluate this information. Now, another common argument I see against this point is that nodes can continue to run on lower memory. Yet, research shows...


Which makes our problem circular. We are right back to square zero if we have delays in transactional processing, which is what we are experiencing now through high UTXO load.
I believe this common misrepresentation of information accurately demonstrates some of the phenomenon which is explained in the scientific research I posted above. I believe it demonstrates how people are prone to ignore rational answers to technical problems because they instead defer to trusted nodes opinions within their network. This is depicted in the belief system dynamics paper...


is true, and the stronger i’s negative attitude toward a statement, the greater i’s certainty of belief that a statement is false.
Now, I have been engaging in and witnessing these events over the last few years and the situation is crystal clear to me. I see how events have transpired with 100% hindsight, and I believe there is ample scientific research that accurately predicts these behaviors. I believe I have demonstrated adequately the cause and effect.
The question remains....what do we do about it? To that, I really dont have a reasonable answer. The best way to counter the entrenchment is to convince those trusted nodes to switch sides. But as explained in my above post, those actors are not benevolent to bitcoin and therefore have economic interests out of alignment with most bitcoiners. We cannot switch those people because their incentives are misaligned.
We've seen **some** movement in this as it is no longer about being anti-SW. You see many people on advocating for LN and SW. The goal posts are shifting, just very slowly. This is good, and it means that we may see SW activation at some point, its just not going to be as quickly as we all hoped. I know I was dead wrong in thinking that we would see quick activation.

Lets be clear here, they have decided to do that on an ideological basis that because "satoshi wanted".
Yet Satoshi also was ok with *most* nodes being on "server farms" with a single wan facing connection with other LAN based nodes doing the work and feeding it to the single wan facing node ...


Satoshi was wrong. Hal finney was right. Satoshi clearly lacked foresight in some area's specifically in regards to game theory on attack vectors. He didn't see the centralization of miners happening with the formation of pools. He didn't see the threat that bitcoin faces when it loses its decentralization by *outsourcing nodes to "server farms".*
Satoshi was wrong.

These people just ignore the evidence that does not fit with their narrow agenda (which is enormous) and then run with the cherry picked quotes that fit their agenda all while engaging in the oh-so-common false dichotomy where they ignore all of the context and middle ground and *changes since satoshi left*.
If these attackers of bitcoin want a paypal 2.0, where bitcoin is censorable and centralized, then they can go run their own altcoin at anytime. Yes, that includes Jihan and the Chinese cabals. They can point ALL their hashing power towards it, im OK with that. I dont care about the loss of hashing power. The less hashing power there is out of china the *better for bitcoin*.

They are starting a factory. This is not about buyers, this is about direct control of hashrate.


While you're *probably right*, I would simply say past preformance does not predict future behavior. We dont know how extreme the centralization effects will become, but if it keeps going in the current direction then there is little doubt we will continue to see more centralization. Whether its large enough to make your plan not work or not is most definitely debatable, and my position most likely an exaggeration.

No, *contributor* is exactly the correct term for minor changes, *developer* is the word for a regularly active developer.
Besides that, I dont think you understand how to read github.  The changelog is based on the differences between the latest minor version, and the major release. The github compare does not show all commits, only the first 250, out of hundreds, possibly more than a thousand commits made between releases. It is not going to show every commit. You will need to use the git commands for that.
So unless you are properly educated on how to pull all the commits directly from git, read them, organize and catalog them, then you are in no place to be saying different than directly from the source.
If bitcoin core says "nearly 100 active contributors" then im going to believe them, *because they are the source*. Do you really think they are lying?
Also, git does show everything. Some people do review, some protocol design, some coding, some testing etc.
For example, Adam Back proposed confidential transactions and optimised it's size. Then implemented it and optimized to make it a bit smaller, then more recently Adam made it another 24% smaller.
Greg doing all of the implementation, with Back doing back end optimization. You can see the current (before 24% optimisation) on elementsproject.org
This contribution towards the progress of bitcoin is invisible and unseen. 
There's a lot to be discussed about the "invisible hands" of bitcoin, who are plodding on over years doing major **major** work but yet it has not been utilized yet, like LN, like Thunder, like CT etc. 
People dont dsisregard the 1000's of hours that goes into code review, design, etc.

I think Greg's difficulty adjustment idea makes the most sense on the path forward, but it's prone to the same issue as many others......Figuring out the right Algo that maximizes efficiency.
I think that if miners want to be given more control, then there needs to be a check of that power. Your system allows for more control without any additional checks of power.
The system needs balance. Taking power from users and giving it to miners there needs to be some better safeguards in place.
Your proposal isn't bad, I just don't like giving any amount of additional powers to miners. There has to be additional safeguards added.
@_date: 2017-03-14 19:54:27


No, but he is arguing what the OP is arguing, that such a determination cannot be made until *after* the economic majority decides which version of bitcoin is bitcoin.
The ETH/ETC is a perfect example. One is clearly valued more than the other. Whatever retains the most economic value on the market is most likely what will end up being considered "bitcoin" because that means the majority of nodes and miners will follow, or have already followed.
I think it could take up to 2 months for the market to play out.
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:12:08


Mostly logical reasoning as I will clarify below, but im all ears, I wish for people to be respectful, engaging and information rich! I could of course be wrong and have no problems admitting this fact.


That is correct.  Also your quotation from the whitepaper does not really hit the issue you are talking about. All it does is clarify that LN fee's will be substantially lower than on-chain fee's, which is exactly what I expressed.
Would you rather get a $1 in transaction fee's, or a 1000 pennies? The supply/demand economics do not change. As more use cases are created for LN, then LN transactions have to compete to get their open channel and closed channel transactions confirmed. The more people use LN, the more that LN style channels need openings and closings on-chain.
I see the utility and value of LN, which will create near-free and **instant 0-conf transactions** to be a major big hit across the entire world. Just stop and think for a second how much is actually possible with microtransactions. This isn't big, this is huge. 
1000x the volume on LN = 100x the bitcoin on-chain volume. With more competition to get transactions confirmed for LN channels, the more fee competition and the more miner revenue.
These things seem like basic economics to me, but it relies on a very simple assumption -
That LN will be successful. 
And if it isn't successful? Nothing will have changed. The fee's people pay to have their transactions on the bitcoin blockchain still need to compete to get into the blocks. Miners will still earn revenue the same way whether LN is enabled or not, but with LN enabled it creates a increased utility that will make bitcoin worth orders of magnitude more. I dont see how any bitcoiner could be against this, but I run into people every day who vote against their best interests.


Sure, I could, if I wanted to completely ignore all of the data on the subject and engage in shitposting ;) Please read [this]( to understand what I mean. Its quite thorough and explains in depth why such a thing is not a answer.
But in short, thats not a capacity increase. Thats not a scaling solution. Thats a jimmy-rig macguyver quick-fix that does nothing but redistribute costs to different portions on the network.
Say you go to the gym, but you have to pay $100 a month. But that sucks and its way too expensive. So instead you move to another gym thats $20 a month. But the $20 a month gym...well....it sucks. There's like 1/10th of the equipment, they are always out of order, no one cleans the place and its covered in bro-sweat.
If you pay less, you cannot reasonably expect that the thing you were paying towards would maintain the same level of quality.
In this particular case, you are merely moving the cost of users, who are paying for the network processing (seems reasonable) and shouldering it to the node operators who literally *dont make a dime* off bitcoin. Those nodes provide the security to the network. If you over-burden the nodes, and the nodes stop participating or cant participate anymore, then the security of the network is greatly diminished.
Bitcoin doesn't work unless its secure. Thats the  and the  and the  priority. Attack bitcoins security if you want to see it fail and turn into paypal.
OR, you can enable SW and allow for 2nd layer networks to economically compete for transactional resources. This is a intelligent way to allow the free market to participate in resource sharing, which economically incentivizes individuals to run nodes and share the load!
Bitcoin had a major flaw when it was released. The major flaw was not solving the economic incentive for nodes. Miners are responsible for timestamping (ordering), but thats all they are responsible for. PoW is part of the ordering. Its just this really huge inefficient process that works.
Nodes however act as the counter-balance of miners power. Since they mint the coins, they need a counter-force to make sure that they play by the rules.
This would be like the president creating the federal reserve. They created a non-government institution to mint the money supply as a counter-force to the government. This was the "tradeoff" we took instead of a national bank. National banks always end up fucking the country and thats why our country was so against it.
Nodes keep the miners honest. Without the nodes, the miners wont behave nicely. Anyone who argues otherwise does not understand how bitcoin works.

After demonstrating that you understand the complexity between multiple environments interacting with each other and creating vulnerabilities it really surprises me that you would engage in a false dichotomy like this and ignore the security aspect of Bitcoin.
Yes some obstacles can be overcome with minimal code changes. Yet what you are not explaining is that those code changes open up changes in both the economics and the security of Bitcoin. There is cause and effect with every single change and you cannot ignore the effect that your change causes.
I would agree with you that the verification issue could be reasonably fixed with a semi non-complicated code change. I would strongly disagree with you that it would only take a simple code change to fix scaling and malleability. The reason I strongly disagree is because in order to 'fix' scaling you greatly impact the economics and security of Bitcoin. 
This is a standard false dichotomy. Just because you can quote on quote fix something with code does not mean that there are not great impacts that occur with that quote on quote fix.
This is not just about hard forks. This is not just about code. This is not just about economics. This is not just about Game Theory.
Please don't ignore cause and effect. Don't you realize that there is a difference between a software project and a *global economic system*? Bitcoin is not just code. It's code with a economical social construct that is decentralized across the world.
Don't ignore these facts and try to make something that is incredibly complex a "black and white" thing.
Because that's exactly what you just did you just try to make all of these issues black and white issues as if there are trivial fixes. That's entirely intellectually dishonest and you are misleading people to think that there are Simple Solutions to complex problems.
People like you are dangerous because not everyone is as educated as the more intellectual members of the subreddit so when they hear people like you who say they are an expert with experience and then say crazy things like yeah there are Simple Solutions to these complex problems the people who are less intelligent are going to believe you and then they are going to get emotionally and ideologically motivated to support a easy solution that is non-existent.
The people like me see your arguments and see that it is filled with holes like Swiss cheese. But most people do not spend a large part of their time investigating these Technologies and therefore do not have the faculties to understand where your logic has gone awry.

SW **is** a optional upgrade. You dont have to use it. No one has to use it. Its a fix for a problem bitcoin has had since birth that allows other on-chain scaling features to be added to bitcoin. One would think that would make you happy but clearly ideological entrenchment prevents satisfaction so long as it is provided by "the opposing side".


I agree.


Im very glad you acknowledge that. Consensus among experts is rarely achieved so when it is, you should really listen to them. 


Whats frustrating is knowing that the more we abuse the security on L0, the more likely L0 is to be co-opted by state actors, which eliminates the access to freedom that bitcoin provides. Ignoring security is the destruction of bitcoin.


You are a better man than most then.


Bitcoin always was meant to be digital gold, a swiss bank in your pocket. The more intelligent folks always knew that this day would come, that there would be a difficult period in which previous freeloaders would be angered by the fact that their swiss bank account in their pocket *has fee's*. The people who assume that you can have security with no cost are irrational people who dont deserve to have their thoughts championed.

Yes, one has to admit his behavior is admirable. When you compare him to people like Gavin and Garzik, who once advocated for rational positions, and then not only abandoned them, but went on to behave in ways that their past selves called outright malfeasance..... 
Luke deserves respect for advocating for a position he has researched thoroughly, explains in depth, and sticking to his guns despite how many people attack him for it.
This could just as easily be called "stubbornness" and in the face of a entrenched ideological position be called "arrogance" or "stupidity". But I don't think this is the case with luke. 
And, if all of the moons and stars and suns align, and UASF gets SW and LN going.....he's probably right. Block size probably will drop. I dont think it will get anywhere near the 10kb he claims of course, but maybe under 750kb?
If LN is restricted to 0.042 in terms of size, the question is how  many transactions are over that amount? This would be a easy way to calculate how much volume is possible to be removed from on-chain to off-chain LN solutions, and even then it would just be a theoretical maximum offloading. Even then, we wont know if users wont just send 10 0.042 payments instead of one 0.42 on-chain payment. The cost dynamics are unknown so we dont know how people will behave yet.

Sure, you can configure your node to use less resources. But then your node serves little purpose. There is a cost/benefit relationship with configuring such parameters.
We are discussing full nodes that actually benefit the network here. If you want your node to benefit the network, you need your UTXO to be unlimbered.
Otherwise whats the point of running the node?
The context of the discussion is how the increase of UTXO impacts RAM for nodes that *actually matter to the network* ...because these nodes are what determine decentralization.
I dont give two fucks about your RPi1 SPV node. It contributes little and does not add to decentralization.
The reason why we are having this misunderstanding is because I manually set my dbcache to take up all of my physical memory (aside from what my OS and the applications use) so that it maximizes UTXO capability. I've had this conversation with many node owners and many do the same. Why would we purposefully castrate our nodes?
So yes, 100%, my UTXO increases RAM requirements and it will do the same when we increase the resources on the network. If the nodes cannot keep up with UTXO it will not be beneficial to the network.
Whats the point of having 100,000 nodes if they cannot account for the transactions? Thats like hiring an accountant with a mental disability and missing 9 fingers.
I understand your point. Yes, you can reduce the memory impact that UTXO has on your node. But you are ignoring the impact it has on the nodes ability to *be a node*.

No, this is a red herring.
The debate is almost entirely technical with only minor consideration for sociopolitical aspects. The latter is sand in the gears that we accept as a consequence of a network, but make no mistake it does not counter technical arguments.
No amount of waxing philosophical or crafting politically charged arguments can challenge the technical consensus achieved amongst experts.
This is so commonly mis perpetuated here that I want to rip my hair out. Appeal to authority is about individuals, not groups. The whole point of having a open source decentralized development team is that when they actually come to consensus then appeal to authority does not apply.
Appealing to authority is cherry picking one authority on the issue and ignoring the 99% of the other experts views. Appealing to authority is "Satoshi said....." 
Advocating for the path forward that near 100% of the technical community has reached consensus on is **not** a appeal to authority.
That's common fucking sense.
The problem is that non-technical people want to cherry pick pseudo-science arguments to forward their irrational agenda. They want to ignore the 99% because it does not fit their narrow agenda. 
This is not a debate and it never was. What you are seeing is a power grab being driven from ideological groups. The fact that they use politics instead of data or technical acumen shows that it is nothing more than a power grab. The problem is a vocal minority of the userbase does not *and is not willing to* understand the technical arguments.
There are not Simple Solutions to complex problems. I see this myth constantly perpetuated by the other side. No amount of discussion on the topic will convince these people away from their preconceived agenda.
They don't research facts. They spread lies. And most of these people do it with good intentions....They think they are right. But they are not educated. Only a minority from that group has bad intentions. People like Ver have clearly crossed the line. Hiring people to spread propaganda? Buying subreddits? That's insanity.
But this small group of people with money and intentions of Power are clearly poisoning the well by motivating non-educated folks to carry the torch in their ideological Crusade. But the thing about ideological Crusades is that they are heavily resistant to evidence-based discussion.
It appears that factual reasoning from technical people have only a minor effect on this discussion. I say that after spending literally years here engaging in Technical discussion with these ideological factions. I'm not advocating that we should stop trying,  just that the situation is complex and using technical arguments is often not enough.
What scientific research has shown is that people who are driven by ideological agenda are not convinced by those who are outside of their trusted node group. If you want to convince these people to change their ideological views then you must convince those that they trust to change their views. The problem is that those that they have come to trust have clear bad intentions for Bitcoin. BU is a power grab. Jihan is a power grab. Roger is a power grab. These are the groups that are poisoning the well and motivating people who would otherwise have well-informed and positively motivated intentions. Is very difficult to change the minds of these people because they have economic alignments that go against what's in the best interest of our community. Jihan sells shovels and doesn't care about the gold those shovels dig. Roger is one of the biggest altcoin pumpers. BU is a team of inept rookies who want the power and fame.
These are not leaders. These are not friends of Bitcoin. You want to compromise with the enemy? You cannot compromise security for politicians agenda.
Edit - Now that im on desktop I wished to add some sources to this argument. Here is a [great national geographic article] ( that everyone should read in full, but is especially relevant to our situation.


Science is about using evidence-based empirical measurement for drawing non-biased conclusions. The problem is that .....


So lets take a step back to understand the **how** of "how we got here". When XT became a thing and decided to censor discussion, it caused a [Streisand Effect]( that pushed a large amount of otherwise intelligent and meaningful people away from Of course, theymos thought that he was doing what was in the best interest for bitcoin. But what he didn't know was that he almost single-handedly created a tipping point for momentum in the other direction.
[&gt;Scientists at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute have found that when just 10 percent of the population holds an unshakable belief, their belief will always be adopted by the majority of the society.](
The centralized big block ideology vs the decentralized small block ideology of bitcoin became a division, and theymos caused a rift that enabled a fevered dedication against small block ideologies and embracing large block ideologies. He created a cult like following on who became dedicated to destroying the ideologies embraced by simply because humans are tribal and sociopolitical issues always become a "us vs them" issue. Now, before big blockers get too excited, this applies both ways. There is a stronger support base of users that believe in the decentralized fundamental nature of bitcoin than there are people who think it should be centralized. The point is that by creating a faction of more than 10% of the userbase that believes in this opposite ideology, it has created a faction that will retain permanance within our community. I strongly feel that bitcoin will not be able to overcome this rift and that these ideologies are becoming more entrenched, especially with economic actors like Jihan Wu putting their thumb on the scale.

and Z are true) does not imply belief consensus. It will polarize a population into two opposing ideological factions when high certainty of belief on one central statement implies high certainties of belief on all other statements, and
low certainty of belief on that central statement implies low certainties of belief on all other statements. One faction accepts the premise of the central statement and thus accepts all the other statements as true; the other rejects the premise of the central statement and thus rejects all the other statements as false.
You see this endlessly perpetuated in politics. You see one faction completely ignore all the truthful statements of the other faction because they no longer believe in the central statement. Similarly, the same has occured here where because of the social division created by theymos (not singlehandedly of course, but also because of Gavin and other factors).

I have seen it emerge literally in the last 30-45 days that there are proponents of BU who are pro-SW. Please understand that this has been an evolutionary process of goalpost shifting, and it means we are winning the battle on the misinformation war.
However we run into some logic problems at that point. How can you be pro-SW but anti-Core? To clarify, you support the code that core engineers made....but you ...dont support the engineers? Instead, you want to take that code, and engineer it into a clearly bug ridden client which is maintained by a few no-names who have no experience in the field and who have demonstrated serious lack of professionalism in their approach? A $20B network? That seems entirely irrational to me.
SW allows for things like extension blocks. Once its enabled, if people want more, then they can create all kinds of new technologies that SW allows. 
As you well know, SW is a bridge. It merely opens up opportunities for future enhancements. The only way you could be against that is for political reasons.

There is no conspiracy here. Core has never needed to inflate its numbers. They've had 100's of contributors for years. There was never a reason to do such a thing.
Occam's Razor is at play here. The simple answer is that bitcoin is a very large interesting open source project that people get pride for contributing.
I can advocate that we should stay aware. Awareness is very important and we want to make sure that no one gets too much power, even a anti-governmental cypherpunk like Adam Back should be watched. But that doesn't mean unfounded conspiratorial accusations.

You clearly dont understand how any of this works. LN utilizes payment channels, which are merely time locked bitcoin transactions. Think of it as a decentralized escrow service. They see that joe locked one bitcoin on the bitcoin blockchain, and so therefore joe now has 1 btc worth of credit on LN.
Joe can then use that 1 btc on LN.
There is nothing to separate joe from Joe Inc. These are just bitcoin transactions.


I don't, but you seem to have a problem with studying things before making your opinion known.
LN is a market based solution. There is no central authority that sets price, it is market who's feerate has yet to be determined because it does not yet exist.

The code is sitting right in front of your face. 


Right. Because that would immediately open up bitcoin to attack vectors with a 8MB total blocksize + SW. Is there a reason you've decided to ignore this danger other than general recklessness?


OK. Since you've admitted they met the terms then can you stop saying they did not meet the terms? Your personal interpretation of semantics is irrelevant to the discussion.


So lets follow your logic. You think that the engineers of a product should ignore the dangers of design flaw and advocate for dangers that they know with a absolute certainty will greatly destroy the trust of this product and diminish the value.
All so that everyone can "get along" ? 
That seems like a good trade off for you? That your "feelings" will be more secure at the cost of bitcoin's value and decentralization?


Sounds like you are setting yourself up to argue against your own argument. Is this a valid agreement or is it not? If its not a valid agreement, please shut the fuck up. If it is, then please stop spreading mistruths on who did what and why.

No doubt there's danger involved. Unfortunately its looking like it might be one or the other, though time will tell us more. If BU really needs 80% (according to charlie shrem) to activate, then they will never get there.
That would make UASF higher risk, but the question is the risk worth it? If miners choose to veto upgrades to the system against the best interest of the network, how else are we going to upgrade?


Not 51% so it doesn't matter. Besides, miners dont get to dicate the rules of bitcoin. The economy does. So if the miners attack core and the exchanges and wallet providers support core, then the miners will be doing so at the loss of their own revenue.
It doesnt make economic sense to attack another blockchain if doing so deflates the value of your asset.

Gavin publicly acknowledged he was going to the CIA. No one disputes this (not even you) and that is more than enough to make my point.


What am I implying? Whatever your reading into my comments is not what I was implying.
When we have only speculation to go off of, because obviously the details of the CIA meeting were private, then *all we can do is speculate*. So no, I wont not mention it again and you can fuck off trying to tell me what I can or cannot speculate on. 


Nice StrawMan. Andreas didn't go meet with a intelligence agency who has a dark history of overthrowing governments, political assassination and coup attempts, not to mention downright murder of American Citizens. Andreas was also not the benevolent dictator in charge of bitcoin's software releases. He was not the *sole custodian* of the github at the time. Andreas had no way to influence bitcoin, but Gavin had the most powerful position one could possibly have within a software project when he went to meet with the CIA.
A you are really equating the Canadian senate to the CIA? The *Canadians*?......Do you also not understand the role the CIA plays? Its the *Central Intelligence Agency* .....it has no role in crafting financial regulation like a Senate does. But it would be very interested in *eliminating fungibility within bitcoin to increase transparency for intelligence purposes....*


Right. You've not demonstrated that here and judging you by your comments above you've not thought this through with more than a 12 year old's cognitive process.


You are ignoring the bigger picture here. This is Gavin, who has advocated for the centralization of bitcoin. Gavin, who has said that node count doesn't matter because we can just move them to server farms like satoshi said.
Except we cannot do that if we want a government-resistant fungible bitcoin.
The point of bringing up the CIA is to establish that it is within Gavin's character to work with the government instead of to code safety mechanisms into bitcoin **to prevent government from censoring or controlling it**.
For someone who accuses people of being juvenile, you sure are naive. Think beyond your petty little personal dreams of buying pizza and coffee with bitcoin.
This is Soverign fucking money that needs to be resistant against the most corrupt governments of the world. How do you think we can do that if we have a single benevolent dictator in control of the code *actively working with government agencies* ?
Your arguments are petty and juvenile. Im thinking about a bitcoin that is secure for everyone in the world to use, to transact without their dicatorship coming in and censoring their payments because its "illegal".
From being able to donate to the political parties you want to (wikileaks, VISA/MC stopped payments) to being able to pay for new medicine thats studied but not approved by the FDA and is not legally available to your market. Fuck the FDA, are you going to let your mother die because the FDA hasn't put their bureaucratic rubber stamp on it?
Bitcoin goes way beyond your petty narrow vision.


No, just you.
I have a long history of supporting and defending Gavin's character. I think Gavin is a really nice guy and I wish that Gavin had the right mettle to handle bitcoin. Gavin does not. Gavin is short sighted, naive, prone to buffonery (CW could not be argued as anything other than buffonery) and making decisions that directly and negatively impact the most fundamental values of bitcoin.
Stop with the dick sucking of Gavin. Gavin writes good code im sure. Im sure he's a competent developer. Gavin should continue submitting code for peer review for bitcoin.
But **no one** and I really mean **no one** should be looking to Gavin for ideological or philosophical advice on how we should manage bitcoin.
Gavin has burned that bridge to the ground, then salted the fucking earth. Thats how bad gavin has fucked things up and if you argue otherwise you are not thinking coherently or are purposefully ignoring the information at hand.

No, the "purpose" of SW is to fix malleability and allow for future upgrades. Don't confuse future possibilities with purpose.
Considering SW also allows for futher on-chain scaling optimizations like Mast, Schnorr, it directly implies that its **not the only answer**. This has been on the core roadmap for literally years now. These erroneous assumptions that are thrown in everyones face only demonstrates people are vastly under-educated on the topics and want to shove their ignorance in everyone elses face.
Its not cool to be ignorant.


Actually, it **is** a true blocksize increase. Its a single container that is a larger container that holds more transactions both for SW and non-SW style transactions. 


Any consensus rule change must be supported by **all** nodes or the transaction will be ignored due to invalid rules. This means that if you wanted to run a alternative client like BU, and you wanted "everyone to accept a blocksize increase" it would mean **everyone** must run BU (assuming everyone wants the blocksize increase).
The difference here is one (BU) is a hard fork that **forces** (notice how you complained about that earlier?) everyone to upgrade, where the other is a softfork that is *backwards compatible* that enables a **optional** feature. Meaning people can run SW-Compatible Core versions, support older style transactions and newer style transactions *for those who wish to use it*.
All I see here is you demonstrating you don't understand how bitcoin works and in the process pointing fingers at the wrong party. You are literally accusing the other side of the failures your wishful implementation would cause.
Ignorance is not cool.


After demonstrating such ignorance, do you really expect anyone to take your opinion serious regarding complexity? You cant even understand the basics of bitcoin and you think **you** are a expert on the subject and can declare what is "unnecessary complexity" ?
The reality is that malleability is a very complex problem. Why do you think bitcoin shipped with it, with full knowledge from satoshi? It was because he had not figured out a "easy" way to fix it. In fact, **no one has**. The most elegant solution so far has been SW, and there is widespread consensus *among experts* that this is the case.
This anti-intellectualism where you demonstrate ignorance, postulate that you are a expert, try to cram your shitty opinion down peoples throats with brute force and then shit on the entire community of **real experts** by saying they are wrong is exactly the reason we are here today.
You dont know WTF you are talking about. You are representative of the majority of people behind BU. All I see is ignorance piled on ignorance combined with ideological and political attacks.
Disagreeing doesn't make you the enemy. It just makes you look stupid if your disagreement is based off faulty information or logical fallacy. What makes you the enemy is when you literally try to advocate for forking the network to your **shit-client** ran by rookies who cannot even write basic code. That is absolutely attacking bitcoin and I wont sit here and let anyone claim innocense when they are orchestrating in-your-face takeover attempts.

Ironic considering thats exactly what you are doing. No, I have a technical background and have participated in these communities for years. If you look through my history you will see a thorough understanding of bitcoin, and advocacy for smart choices backed by well reasoned stances and empirical data. Go ahead, do some digging. I know I know, you're lazy like everyone else and you want to just pretend im ignorant so you can lash out at me, but thats not whats real here.


It doesn't "make me feel good", its used to demonstrate that you are a uneducated individual who is trying to assert he has knowledge (let alone expertise) on subjects he does not have knowledge on. A lot of people do it, and these people need to be made aware that they are **not** experts and their opinions should then be backed by empirical data instead of opinions since no one cares about a ignorant opinion.
Regarding appeal to authority, yes, also a mis-commonly used term, to which you've *also* mis-used it here. Did you even read the definition you posted"


Go ahead and tell me how people who have spent their lives engineering digital currency systems (Adam Back, Nick Szabo) are outside the topic of bitcoin?
You also tried to use it incorrectly in applying it in a singular usage, as if I quoted individuals instead of the **group** of developers. Bitcoin Core has over 400 contributors, with 106 contributing to the last release alone. You cannot "appeal to authority" a entire decentralized group of developers, let alone do it quoting developers who are within the particular industry of context.

Of course no one immediately understands a new complex system. Why even make that statement? It had nothing to do with any context. Captain obvious.


Sounds like you are bitter about having stupid expectations. Bitcoin just smashed through it's ATH. Your expectations must have been really irrational if your bet didn't make sense considering that.
Did you think Bitcoin was a get rich scheme where you invest pennies and make millions overnight?
For someone who has spent 7 years on Bitcoin, why don't you tell us all why you are ignorant to the fact that Bitcoin was designed from the start to have nodes enforce rules against miners?
"That would be stupid"
Right. So if the miners decided to change the 21M limit it would be stupid for your node to reject their block?

Yes, and that attack vector still exists today. This "trivial" fix you are suggesting would need a hard fork, which by the complex nature of a global decentralized network is not "trivial". OR, we can do a safe soft fork that fixes it.
Again with false dichotomies. 


Bitcoin must retain its security or its worthless. If bitcoin is not secure then it does not matter who is or isn't priced out because bitcoin will be worthless.
Regardless of this point there is a solution that has been engineered over the past 3 years that is now ready to roll and to reduce costs for everyone so that you can buy your coffee and pizzas as much as you want. Instead of bickering over psuedo-science, why dont we instead advocate for the one thing thats ready to go that has been vetted by the most qualified experts in the field?
There's a *reason* that 99% of the experts in this community has reached consensus on this path. The *reason* is because its *currently* the best path forward. Will there be a better path forward in the future? Yea sure, tumblebit is awesome. But its no where near prime time and we would both agree that the blockchain needs relief now.


Why are you cherry picking luke and no one else? Everyone knows luke is a crazy person and even amongst core dev's his idea's are considered outlandish.
Is this Luke-Jr-Bitcoin now? No? Then why are you even bringing it up? No one takes that guy seriously and his code is peer reviewed just like anyone elses would be, and only adopted through the nakamoto consensus like all other code is. So this personal attack on luke is irrelevant to the **technical discussion**.
As you can see, you've already launched into personal tirades over things that have nothing to do with technicalities because your technical arguments do not hold water.
Now are you really going to sit here and tell me that this is "not complex" and that there are "simple solutions" ? Because me and you can debate over this topic until 100 sun's come down and we would still probably be no where.
But sure, its not complex right?

Except thats just utterly and blantantly false. This all started with your best friend Mike Hearn deciding to try and fork bitcoin with Bitcoin XT.
Remember that guy? Yea, the guy who also singlehandedly tried to destroy bitcoin, and then when he failed he rage quitted and tried to sabatoge bitcoin by using his community repertoire to send the markets tummeling by declaring [bitcoin is dead](
Lets not forget your other glorious thought leader, Gavin, who joined Mike Shit Hearn in attempting to fork bitcoin, despite saying  ["Good idea or not, SOMEBODY will try to mess up the network (or co-opt it for their own use) sooner or later. They'll either hack the existing code or write their own version, and will be a menace to the network."]( ?
By gavins **own admission** he attempted to co-opt bitcoin with Mike Hearn.
Are you really trying to say that those two individuals did not create the division that currently exists in bitcoin?
Because you would be living in a utter fantasy if you think so. I was here, I watched it all unfold day by day. I know exactly how we were as a community pre-BitcoinXT and post-bitcoinXT.
What Roger has done here has merely goal post shifted his position from XT to Classic to BU and he will be a reckeless motherfucker who will advocate whatever the next "big blocks or else" client that tries to take over bitcoin.


There are plenty of people to direct *past* hate at, and then there are people who we should direct *current* hate at. The difference is what they've done in the past vs **what they are doing right now**.
Roger and Jihan are the new Gavin and Mike Hearn. Except Jihan has way more power than Roger as we can see with all of the Miners signaling for a client they know beyond any reasonable doubt will completely fuck up the bitcoin network.
Thats not just negligence. Thats hostility towards bitcoin. Some of these people might just be stupid and have good intentions, but some of them are also heavily economically invested in alt coins and would love to see their profits multiply by 10x when bitcoin suffers do to their involvement.

No, actually, it does. Life is dynamic. Everything ever, other than the fundamental laws of nature, are dynamic. Everything changes, everywhere, every moment.
To expect a system to not evolve is exactly what a religious fanatic would think. Its not founded in any rationality whatsoever.
There's a point to peer review. Its not a conspiracy theory to maintain incumbency. Its to ensure that the changes suggested are thoughtfully attacked from all angles from as many highly experienced individuals as possible to prevent detrimental change.


It makes them irrational, stubborn and dogmatic. If you cannot change your position as new data becomes available, then you are not a rational person. No qualms.


Because you are so deeply entrenched in your own dogma that you cannot see the irrationality of your own statements.


No, its not weird at all. I see this every single day from people like you and others. You are so blinded by your own emotions that you are completely immune to rational discourse.
Frankly I dont know why you participate here. I would be stressed out of my mind if I keep trying to rationalize with people my point of view and everyone keeps telling me how irrational I am.

Bitcoins most important property is its immutability, which is maintained through its decentralization. This is not a black and white issue, its complex and requires study to understand.
If you drastically lower node count you open bitcoin up for new attack vectors its previously never experienced. Bitcoin is *worthless* in this state of affairs.
You, I and everyone else wants to see bitcoin prosper. Which is why we need to do things safely, and not recklessly.
Everyone gets everything they want with SW. They get a blocksize increase, they get malleability fixes, they get cpu ddos vectors removed, they get 2nd layer networks that will scale bitcoin they get tumblebit, they can work on extension blocks and make things as big as they want!
It has everything.
Why would we go the reckeless route when we can go the safe route and appease everyone?
Dont be fooled. The people who are against SW are political power grabbers or gullible fools who have drank too much koolaid. There is no technical reason to be against SW and there are massive technical reasons to be against hardforks.

@_date: 2017-03-18 20:46:57


This may seem true if you dont understand the technicalities behind how LN and the blockchain interoperate.
All transactions on LN are timelocked transactions that are sent on the bitcoin blockchain. After the trades on LN have finished, then the LN transaction is "settled" on the blockchain.
If anything, the increased capacity and utility of lightning network will create **fucking enormous** business activity. We are talking real microtransactions. So many use cases for the system that my head explodes thinking of all of them.
That increase of utility will mean orders of magnitude more opening and settling transactions between LN and the bitcoin blockchain.
The supply economics dont change with the introduction of LN. LN still has to create transactions on the bitcoin blockchain. Its not "taking away" business, its *create more business*.
The way to think of it is right now there are buses running back and forth between a hub and  destinations. The LN buses will be able to cram many more people on their buses than the non-LN buses, but the *utility* of the buses has increased and so therefore their usefullness. This means that the buses can charge more to go to their destination. So the bus operators are paying the hub *more* not less to pickup the customers there. This is because the demand is higher because of all the extra customers needing to go on the buses.
Its not a perfect analogy, but hopefully it adds some clarity.
Increased bitcoin utility = more use cases = higher fee's for on-chain transactions.

The fucking hypocrisy is so thick my body is covered in sludge.
The compromise was SegWit. One hell of a compromise considering all of the potential it unlocks instead of a rookie patch that merely distributes the cost of the network onto nodes. It fixes so many incentives that are lacking.
All of the BU supporters are not going to STFU until they see the fruit that Core's work bears. But that won't be for years as LN networks developed and competes, along with new improvements. So hopefully we can get SW activated so we can move forward. Stop throwing fucking sand in the gears BU kids.

No, they would need more than a simple majority and they would need the economic support of the industry. I think they know this so its no where near as cut and dry as you make it out.
I think they hoped that by showing a large amount of hashpower is behind the movement that it would convince the community and economic actors within bitcoin to switch to their client.
Without switching to their client, or declaring support for it, it would be financial suicide to fork.

You should continue doing that. Bitcoin was not meant to compete with domestic transfer systems. We have paypal and venmo and other domestic services. The EU has instant near free bank transfers to most EU nations.
Bitcoin is a competitor to SWIFT and a censorship-resistant digital gold. When you want to transfer your Indonesian money to Canada, then you will use bitcoin.
People who advocated using bitcoin's blockchain as a day to day payment system did not understand basic supply side economics or security tradeoffs.
Those people are now very butthurt that they were wrong and are insisting on flinging mud in everyone's eyes over their failed assumptions. If you click the downvote button then you are merely admitting you were one of those people.

I entirely disagree and I think that there was a greater threat when we faced XT. Like, much greater. I think the division was higher, and the war more powerful.
BU has substantially less economic support than XT. XT had industry support all across the board. BU does not, unless you count mining centralization in china. Gavin, since he was still considered a central planner at that point, had a lot of industry influence. He was able to convince a strong base of economic industry support.
As im sure you know, its the users, not the miners who decide the rules of bitcoin. Thats why XT was a much larger threat.

Dishonesty is not something that can be advocated for here, there, or anywhere. You cannot expect to take over a $20B network all while photoshopping screenshots so they better suite your narrative.

You are saying "Gavin makes sense" while gavin's argument relies on "aligned economic incentives" that have been disproven time and time again. It also relies on "rational actors" when there are clearly irrational actors in bitcoin.
Just replace "altruistic behavior" with "rational actors" and it will make more sense. I should have just said that in the first place.


See, this is why we dont like BU and its supporters. Its people like you who make completely illogical arguments and point at the sun and say "See? The sun isn't there!"
You are really going to try and claim that *literally hundreds* of developers on a *open source* project from *all places around the world* is "centralized" because it is *hosted on github* ?
Where its hosted is irrelevant. What matters is *who the developers are, how many, and where* that makes the development *structure* decentralized. To answer this for yourself with basic logic, ask yourself....if github burned to the ground today with no backups, would bitcoin die? No? OK. Then github has nothing to do with it. The developers are who matter and they are distributed all over the world.  
Your argument is naive or purposefully misleading. Both arn't cool.


No. You are just making shit up and then combining it with faulty logic and false dichotomies. Yes, BU does look to give miners *more control* over a system. This is the problem. You've admitted the problem in your sentence there. There is a balance of power that exists in bitcoin the way it is and you want to obstruct this balance of power and give **more** power to miners?
Mining centralization is the biggest threat bitcoin faces. Mining centralization is the biggest threat bitcoin faces. Mining centralization is the biggest threat bitcoin faces.Mining centralization is the biggest threat bitcoin faces. Mining centralization is the biggest threat bitcoin faces. Mining centralization is the biggest threat bitcoin faces.
Understand it. Read it. Absorb it.
Now think about that and you are really advocating to giving *humans* control to dictate the rules of bitcoin? What happened to nakamoto consensus? I swear its so frustrating to see you guys praise satoshi out of one side of your mouth, and then advocate to destroy the system that he created.
Satoshi designed the system to have the *nodes enforce the rules* and *miners to timestamp*. The nodes keep the miners honest by enforcing the rules.
BU proposes to change that structure to allow the miners to make changes to the rules.
That destroys the balance of power that bitcoin has. Its already delicate, and you really want to advocate smashing it? talk about throwing rocks in a glass house.


Everyone says its the economic majority that has control **because thats how bitcoin works**. You are just ignorant and dont understand this, so you come on here on your sock puppet account to shitpost your narrow agenda.
Bitcoin's rules were and was and will always enforced by nodes. The "economic majority" is referencing economic nodes. The nodes that run for exchanges, the nodes that run for wallets, etc.
Just because you dont know wtf is going on doesn't mean that you get to lie or purposefully mislead others who know better.


This is how naive you are. Both are correct. You are trying to make this issue black and white when there is endless context. There were *very few* things that satoshi was wrong about, but most of the system he got right. Core is addressing the few things he got wrong (node centralization, cenorship-resistence) by being responsible stewards.


Right. And once you understand that miners dont control bitcoin then you'll start to realize which way this will go. You have a very naive and incomplete understanding of how the system works. Miners timestamp by ordering transactions via PoW. Nodes, which are represented by the economic majority, are the ones who get to decide the rules.

You keep demonstrating you dont understand how bitcoin works. Its a decentralized open source project. There is no "core" in terms of a central authority. There are top contributors, and each contributor has a weight assigned to his opinions because of how much work they do on the project. So if you want something to be supported by "core", you would have to convinced the majority of developers on "core" to come to consensus on a issue.
The HK agreement **was not, I repeat, was NOT, I repeat again because I know how fucking stupid you are....WAS NOT** signed by "Core". It was signed by a few developers who could not represent something **which cannot be represented by a few**.
Get that through your thick skull. Luke is not core. Greg is not core. Back is not core. None of of these people can make decisions for "core".
All core can do is **TRY** to reach consensus on pull requests and if consensus is reached then they will merge it.
You've adequately demonstrated you have no clue how any of this works. And really, you are going to say "its not tested"?!!?! How do you think something gets tested? Why do you think there's no BIP assigned?
**Because core developers have not reached consensus on the proposal**.
You keep trying to advocate that "core" do something without even understanding **what "core" is**.
Its astounding at how illiterate you are on the subject for how long you've been involved in bitcoin. For someone who's spent years shitposting here one would have thought you understood the nature of "decentralization" by now.


I believe there are 3 separate BIP's pending right now. You are entirely out of touch with reality and keep making false claims.


Right, so when you cant use facts you step into a relevant discussion of opinions and feelings? GTFO.


Quality shitposting.


Shows that you've never read the whitepaper. If you did, you would realize that "ordering transactions" if part of PoW. PoW exists *solely* to provide timestamping services. This is "ordering transactions". A miners role is to timestamp ....**thats it**.

Right, which is why peer review and consensus matters. When you have experts that are using bad data, faulty logic and cherry picking, it gets caught in peer review.
There are imperfect humans in every aspect of the world. Scientists make mistakes, but peer review amongst the majority catches those mistakes and makes them stand out.
So yes, you can find "experts" that will tell you climate change is not caused by carbon. But the reasons they will use to explain will have been *thoroughly* disputed amongst the academic community.
We are talking about *consensus* here. That was my point. You have to listen to the consensus of experts. Not the individuals. Did you miss that entire section I devoted to this point? I was very thorough on the issue. Remember, i said.....


When you put it in perspective, it seems fucking crazy right?
It is. Those are the people who you see arguing against the educated majority who has reached consensus.

Interesting fact thrown out there, that they process 5-8% of daily transactions. They stipulate that blocksize issue needs to be resolved because various entities are considering switching to alt coins on the logic that "they don't care how the money gets there, as long as it does"
While this may be true, that viewpoint might not necessarily hold its water in action. First, getting payment processors to accept other currencies and to hedge risk to offer minimal fee's is quite a difficult task. Does anyone know of any bitpay/coinbase/etc payment processors that will do LTC or any other alt's with the same structure that they offer for btc?
If so, then their concerns are valid and the risk is definitely there for market disruption.
If not, then good luck with that line of thinking. If you cannot hedge your risk then you are turning your payment processing business into a high risk casino and we've seen how often that turns out to fail, which is almost all the time.
Regardless of any opinions expressed, I cannot help feel that it is all politics at this point. There are scaling solutions that have been in the works for years now that are going live in the next few months. I do not think there is any rational doubt that these solutions will take the load off the chain and immediately free up much needed space. We are running full and its definitely causing fee pressure to rise as we have seen fee pressure almost triple in the past few weeks. I recall it being around 4 cents before the recent blockspace pressure for fastest confirm, and now we are sitting at 11 cents according to [21's fees page](
@_date: 2016-06-08 19:38:16
I think thats a good point, really, even if it was possibly meant with humor. The goal post is shifting constantly on what is and what is not spam, and clearly legally binding contracts are not spam, right?
Yet they may only incur the minimal processing fee just to serve as a time stamping mechanism.
@_date: 2019-03-29 16:13:19
And for someone who was active on the battle-lines during this 5 year battle, I must say it feels *really really* good to be vindicated.
We said for years that there were nefarious actors who were clearly engaging in behavior specifically designed to constrict the network and prevent usage.
Research confirmed it.


(23.41%) out of 1,645,667 total Bitcoin transactions were spam during a 10 day
period at the peak of the spam campaign. We also show that this attack had
a negative impact on non-spam transactions, increasing average fees by 51%
(from 45 to 68 Satoshis/byte) and processing delay by 7 times (from 0.33 to 2.67
hours). This shows that an adversary who is willing to expand modest amounts
of bitcoin (at least $49,000 USD), to pay higher fees, can DoS Bitcoin.
We have empirical evidence of only specific pools engaging in clearing these spam transactions. Its highly coincedental that these pools are all closely associated with, or are direct subsidaries of Bitmain.
While this does not 100% implicate them, it provides a highly questionable link between the main spammers and recollecting lost spam fees(claimed to have been a client on QuadrigaCX, see part 3 of LaurentMT).
Its very interesting now that everyone is down in the dumps, these attacks have magically stopped.
Maybe one day we will get a leak from the QuadrigaCX database to determine who was the actual owner behind those addresses. Now that the exchange is closed, this is probably more likely than it was before, which is to say before there was probably 0% chance, now there is a small chance.

There is no easy quick on chain solution. You cannot expect something which does not exist. SW is a small efficiency increase, so it has minor scaling properties, but it is not enough for long term scaling.

But they can spend XCP, yes? And BTC can be converted into XCP? The question is how valuable will this EVM be to the network, and how will it secure the value of XCP to be used in this context.
But smart contracts are not so much all about money per say, but about legally binding immutability. Yes, we need the money component to make them bigger, better, faster, etc, but right now if you sign a legally binding contract, does that contract transfer the assets? No, it does not, it just creates a means so that the assets can be transferred once the legal paperwork is processed by a authority within the financial system as it relates to those assets.
So still clearly a step forward in the right direction....

Of course they manifested. It does not matter how golden and pure his intentions were, or how brain washed he was by his own dogma.

Reading the title I was extremely interested in this article. It starts off well enough but once we get into the meat and potatoes the very first thing is already objectionable.


And this first section the author postulates that environmental disasters are caused by Banks and lending. Already we can establish that there's no reason to read further because the author must not have thought through this very well to make such a claim.
In order to understand why this is illogical we must do exactly as the author advises in the first paragraph which is to say we must step away from are preconceived notions and try to evaluate the situation from a different perspective. Specifically we have to imagine a world where privately issued currency doesn't exist and we only have, e.g. public cryptocurrencies.
In a world of public distributed ledger's, does anyone really think that there won't be lending? Power (wealth) concentrates. this is well-established which is why we create such complex systems in order to try to combat this. If you've ever bothered to look at a Bitcoin wealth distribution chart you would know that Bitcoin is not immune to concentrated power systems. the wealth distribution in the Bitcoin system is just as bad as the wealth distribution in most societies, which is to say that a small number of people own a large amount of the wealth.
If you accept these facts than you can understand that from the get-go Bitcoin is already a system of concentrated wealth. Which means that lending will inevitably happen.
You would have to be seriously misinformed to assume that the people who are invested into Bitcoin are somehow more environmentally protective than the current financial status quo. 
Greed is what drives Bitcoin. The same greed will drive lending. Specifically more advantageous opportunities will allow for greater greed and limitations of personal responsibility perceived. which is a fancy way of saying people will turn a blind eye when opportunity strikes and it's juicy enough. Because they are human.
Whether we have privately issued currency or publicly issued will not change this.

This was the most important point to me.








I think we can clearly see some political and philosophical differences clashing here. All I see is a opt-in layer 2 protocol that establishes a encrypted data set for those *who wish to use it*.
I think if the BIP could be revised to "keep the payment info private" when *any type of wallet* is used, then I would be totally ok with this being merged. It adds some practical achievements that bitcoin sorely needs with no cost attached.
I think this comes down to how you want to use bitcoin. If I want to attach a note to my message declaring who I am, I can do so right now. But I cannot do that with a encrypted note baked into the protocol. That is especially handy for a crap ton of commerce related examples.
If that encrypted data set is used to communicate private information between the buyer and the seller, *who fucking cares* ? you really blew this one up for no reason.
Your examples are lacking. This is in no way related to blacklists, or tor node logs. This is enabling a feature that is very useful to the majority of bitcoin users. 
You know what impacts fungibility? Using your position of authority to attack developers who are contributing to our community. These developers are also working on privacy enabling features by implementing them into their wallets. And your actions have personally caused damages to them, which means less users will use their wallets built with privacy preserving features. You want to talk about fungibility but where is security baked into the protocol? Where is Open Transactions in the protocol? Where is coinjoin in the protocol? You expect wallet developers to come up with solutions but where are our protocol level solutions?
Next time lay off the coffee and use technical reasoning instead of politicking to accomplish your goal. The merits of this BIP should be discussed in full with revisions that gets the advantages without any security disadvantages attached.

Maybe im just not getting it, but how would a miner create enough high fee transactions to skew the metrics on a global basis without losing a ton of money?
They would only get their fee's back if they mined their own transactions. Which would only happen if they won that particular block. Antpool currently has 21% of the hashrate, so if we assumed they continued with that % they would theoretically mine 1 out of 5 blocks.
Which means they would lose 80% of the high fee transactions to other miners.
This is why bitcoin is awesome. Its *expensive* to attack. So using metrics that are based on economic indicators that require financial resources is *probably* a good idea, but again, im not an expert (aka, no PhD) so please dont take my opinion too seriously.

Came here to state a similar sentiment. Obviously when we are suffering a DoS attack, a lot of users are going to experience problems, which is going to lead to a flurry of new "Why wont my transaction confirm" posts.
To speculate that these posts are from shills in order to suppress price is hysteria founded in nothing more than paranoia spiked koolaid.
Naturally there is some sort of actor who is attacking the network for currently unknown reasons. But to assume that he has a network of shills working for him is irrational. This is a global technological network with [250 thousand transactions daily] ( that depends on fluid mechanisms, and when someone throws sands in the gears there are always going to be valid concerns expressed. If a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of users complain, this sub would be flooded to high hell with problem/concern posts.
Just remember that these attacks have occurred before and we got through it minus a little hysteria and blockspace arguments. The same thing is going to happen again, and I've already noticed the concern trolls out in full force crying foul.
Im a little disappointed at whoever is doing this, that they are doing it NOW, of all times, during a bull run. That seems to me that it is someone who has either a economic incentive to see bitcoin fail, or a emotional attachment to the failure of bitcoin. Maybe a spited developer, or someone heavily invested in alternative (ETH, LTC, etc) currencies.

Yes, and since our housing market has not recovered since the crash, that means we may see this broad effect dampen prices to below 2009-2010 levels.
My house is only 10-15% of what it was when I bought it in 2009, and I bought it at the bottom of the market. Which means that it wont take very much to see it go below the value of when I bought it. A general market effect can have a chilling on overall real estate prices.
When the markets crash, buyers flee the markets. When sellers do not have a adequate demand of buyers they drop prices. 
The effect you refer to is certainly valid, and the issue was that there was a real estate bubble. But we've not recovered much from the bottom of that bubble bursting, so I would expect prices to fall right back down to where they were, or worse, at the next collapse.

Take this with a grain of salt as this is vaneck stating there is a resolution, *not* the SEC.


If that was true (according to the perspective of the SEC), then the last ETF would not have been rejected. Afaik, nothing has changed in the way CBOE handles anything.


Much, much more info needed. nice statement, but we need actual information and not declarations.
I don't know if this is just media hype, but I suspect it's wishes for the wind on vanecks part.
I'm fairly certain the SEC is purposefully not approving ETFs and will continue to do so for some while yet regardless of facts.

Its ok. Price is often lagged towards factors. Some academic research shows a 6+ month price lag between hash power increase and price.
This is invaluable data that demonstrates there are *millions* of btc hodlers. Having account data from coinbase is great but who knows how many of those accounts actually purchased BTC? Probably a large percentage of goose eggs.
But owning a physical wallet translates to a nearly 1:1 holding ratio. Keep in mind a large percentage of buyers don't have HW wallets and we don't have sales data from trezor.

Denying that your assumption is true? Of course. I reject such a claim outright on the basis that its patently false.
First, transactions that pay an appropriate fee are not spam. If the owner of the transaction is purposefully creating large UTXO sets in an attempt to purposefully sabotage the network, then I would personally consider it "spam" regardless of fee paid. However, there is a discussion to be had about the anti-fragility of the bitcoin network and what is the best path forward to prevent attack vectors. The circular argument here, one that everyone of your character type seems to ignore, is that we have SW activation pending which completely removes this attack vector. Yet none of you mention that in your comments or seem to think about that simple fact.
Nothing about blocks being full have damaged bitcoin's utility. Anyone, anywhere, anytime can still send money from point A to point B. Yes, its a few more cents than it was 2 years ago. 
Your assumption that micro-transactions were possible before is of course false, so you are creating a strawman argument here. There was no microtransaction feasibility before, and therefore there is none now, so what utility precisely was removed?
If you are are going to suggest that the utility of those who wished to use the blockchain **to literally transfer pennies** is "removing utility" .....
Then I would conclude that you are not worth listening to. We have real problems to consider and we dont need bike-shedding trolls here stirring up trouble over nothing.

What ideologies?  I've read the white paper dozens of times. There is nothing about block size theory in there. It's a white paper not a thesis.
Also, Satoshi is not god and he was clearly wrong on some things.  He also wanted a super node LAN farm with one single facing WAN node handling all of that LAN node farm traffic/work. Which is outrageously naive for a technology that is supposed to be censorship resistant and decentralized. Can't be decentralized with one wan facing node connected to a node LAN server farm. 
Maybe you should read the history better. It was Hal who actually first pointed out the censorship resistant possibilities. Satoshi was actually quite naive on this at first, and it was others who excelled better on resistance vectors. We have much better developers right now who are proficient at attack vector game theory.
So leave your religous dogma out of the conversation, it has no technical merit.

I agree with this statement but the speculation that BIP75 removes privacy has yet to be founded.


This is definitely not a valid argument in favor of BIP75 removing privacy. As previously stated, I could include any information in any transaction if I so wished. Creating a encrypted channel for you to communicate this information seems like *a pretty good idea*. How *you wish to use it* is *up to you* and if you want to take the extra effort to include *your personal information in your transaction* then that is *your choice*.
It does not detract from privacy preserving features within bitcoin.
To make this simpler to understand, you can go to a wrestling match to watch wrestling, to compete or you can say "fuck wrestling I dont want to watch that shit". If you wish to compete, you risk getting hurt. If you wish to watch the match, you dont risk getting hurt.
Either way its your choice to attend the match and your choice on what action to take. The fact that the wrestling match exists does not pose any threat to your personal harm unless you choose to jump in the ring and flip off the champion.
But there are a lot of people who enjoy wrestling, who enjoy watching it and who benefit from competing. Creating encrypted channels within transactions allows for more efficient e-commerce and I cant help but think thats a good thing and any rationalization that this "will be used to collect information" is a hilariously illogical argument.
You have already given them your information if you are doing business with them, and if you have not and want a secure channel to give that information this is a great way to do it. This does not create any requirement for you to include any other information. If you choose to associate your bitcoin address you are sending funds from with other change addresses that are linked to other spending addresses then that is a loss of privacy of your doing. You willfully hand over your privacy.
This changes nothing. Arguing that it changes a mindset is blowing smoke up peoples assess. Its founded literally on semantics.

Completely agree. I was always against the 95% threshold. As miners have demonstrated historically, they are a diverse set of people who cannot achieve consensus, less and less so as time goes on.
Whats more important is that the economy/industry supports the changes, which then economically incentivizes miners to mine the chain that brings them the most economic return.
I too think this was a mistake of Core to make the threshold so high. It smells like a compromise to the likes of luke-jr's 100% consensus feelings, as he constantly advocates that we cannot make changes to the system without consensus, and then defines consensus as "100% agreement".
Good post. Yes, not 100% apples to apples, but pretty darn close. And most definitely close in the ways that matter. If anything, "the bar is higher" (less forcing, less dictator like) with SW, making the argument even more diluted from BitWhale.
@_date: 2017-03-24 06:05:47
That's a broad assumption and should not be taken as truth. Core does not dictate the rules of Bitcoin. They cannot force a hard fork. We likely would have had a veto no matter which way we went since there are maximalists on both spectrums.
Also do not ever forget that there is money to be made off fear. Humans will always exploit this for financial gain. So you must instead assume irrational actors will always exist and plan around it.
This is why they opted for a soft fork. Because you cannot assume everyone is always on board, that is a very naive approach that will be exploited and abused.
The result would be a splitting of the network. Anyone who argues that is a good thing for Bitcoin is straight smoking the koolaid instead of drinking it.

Im sorry, has bitcoin stopped working? Its been working fantastic, even throughout the full bull run and the dump. Which by the way, big block proponents have been saying for the last 2 years that the sky will fall when we have the next price raise.
Well, the sky didn't fall, and there was not a single hiccup throughout the entire bull run. I would know, i run a node and I've been monitoring mempool the entire time. There's been no backlog. Which also proves that the "congestion" issues that bitcoin has had in the last several years were definitely malicious actors attacking the network with various utxo attacks. What we saw in the last week was the full "organic growth" model that we could measure naturally. Anything beyond that is obviously a malicious actor specifically trying to clog the network.
You should stop listening into religious or political dogma. "Early Writings" means jack shit. No one cares about early writings. We care about **NOW**. Now the environment is drastically different than what it was before.
Things didn't pan out the way satoshi wanted. We didn't deliver a fully decentralized network. Full node distribution is at a long term decline.
These are factors satoshi could not have known when he wrote those words. Satoshi is smart enough to pivot on his stances when he realizes that the environment has changed.
Listen, you seem like you are parroting the words of others. I dont think you've actually looked into the history of bitcoin because the depth of your reply is incredibly shallow.

We have serious problems.
And your post is kinda funny. 60TB SSD's? Sure, for data centers. The same place all that bandwidth you are talking about exists.
You are not the thinking about the health of the network. We need real people mining and running nodes, not commercial outfits. Which means we need to make sure Bitcoin runs on low resources. The most important feature of Bitcoin is censorship-resistance. So we must focus on efficiency before we worry about unleashing the beast. All too many developers lack optimization because they have the lazy attitude of "Moore's law tech blah blah" so design is inefficient. 
Satoshi said we could run a LAN node farm with one WAN facing node to forward their traffic. Think how stupid of a idea that was in hindsight?

Ok.. so for the other people who may come across this, because I know that is not interested in facts or data, here is just a brief overview of 5 minutes spent on google and reddit.
[Bitfury White Paper on Scaling](
Very important is the table. 


In that table, you can see it estimates a 40% drop **immediately** in node count with a 2MB upgrade and a 50% over 6 months. At 4mb, it becomes 75% immediately and 80% over 6 months. At 8, it becomes 90% and 95%.
The reason for this drastic impact?


RAM as a node requires at least 2 GB RAM to run with margin [15]. **For example, if block size increases to 2 MB, a node would need to dedicate 8 GB RAM to the Bitcoin client, while more than a half of PCs in the survey have less RAM.**
[Here is a website devoted to simulation of bandwidth requirements vs blocksize increases](
[Here is a great post by explaining some of the data](
But looking at the bitfury whitepaper, it claims **99GB a DAY** @ 8MB, which would what bitcoin would effectively be @ a 2MB HF + SW, which would = 8MB.
Can anyone rationally claim that 99GB a **day** can be sustained by the majority of current nodes? How about 8GB of RAM? That eliminates the *majority* of nodes right off the bat. There's a discussion to be had here on impact and effects, but we cannot have that discussion if one side refuses to even acknowledge basic facts.
[There is also this research as well]( which states -








































































@_date: 2017-01-20 04:33:30
The entire conversation is pointless since you are not a future teller and you cannot discern whether we will reach consensus on a hardfork. Whether or not the upgrade is "for the good" is irrelevant *if the chain splits*.
Since you cannot predict whether the chain will split or not, *anything you say is absolutely pointless*. Anyone who thinks that we can have a non-contentious hardfork is *completely disillusioned from reality*, considering we cannot even get a softfork upgrade that is sorely needed.

I'm not so sure as to the accuracy of that comment. I have not really seen vile character assassination of Ver. What I have seen is a constant criticizing of political statements being made in place of technical arguments. Which is not ad hominem.
Ver has been peddling snake oil for long enough. It's long past his time to go away and stop damaging real progress.
Charlie Lee said it best. If SW didn't scale it wouldn't have been contested. Proving that it's politics, not technicals that drove division. With Ver paying employee's to use politics to divide the community, I'm unsure how any rational person could see his current stance as anything but harmful to our community.

I think thats rather disingenuous, considering -
I might also remind you this was the same argument used for segwit when it was at the same stage, and 30-60 days later those arguments disappeared.
Code, like everything else in life, progresses. It goes from point A, to point B to point C. We are at the edge of point C and saying its not ready is like saying that the F1 racecar is not ready for the race because the driver has not jumped in the seat yet. The car is ready to go, but the driver has not taken control yet.
Similarly, LN is ready to go, just needs testing to confirm everything is cool and to work out any final kinks.
The rest of your post is a false dichotomy. You can ignore the greater context of security and decentralization, but I wont.

EDIT - Really? I got downvoted for pointing out that the FAQ has extensive information on the subject and that new people should really go to that first? Get the sand out of your sensitive vagina's people. The FAQ is there for a reason. I didn't say "Be a asshole", I said "Look at the FAQ first".

Good comment, appreciate the thoughts. No doubt this is a complex issue, and much thought should go into it. The problem is that the majority of people in opposition are not opposing for rational reasons, but instead for political reasons founded mostly on conspiracy theory.
If the 95% activation threshold was not in place, I would warrant this criticism as 100% valid and agree with you. But since it is in place, this is more of a theoretical conversation on future technocratic attack vectors.

That's patently false.
Bitcoins most fundamental value is censorship resistance. It could be both slow and less efficient and still be worth way more than it currently is.
This is naive thinking. Bitcoin does not *need* to "compete" with centralized systems that will always be more effective than a decentralized network. It would be beneficial for such a property to exist yes, but do not mislead others into your illogical thought process.
This is how so many people got brainwashed into thinking Bitcoin would always be a fast free network. By repeating such fantasies on social media over and over.
Bitcoin was meant to create sovereign money systems that prevent central monetary actions that dilute the value of your money. Censorship-resistant properties is the most valuable thing in that scenario, not a quick free payment system to buy socks on a forever ledger.

I think the appropriate rebuttal to the "there is no inherent value" is to establish the value of the network. There is inherent value to a instant settlement payment network with double spending protection.
The network that visa built to process its transaction all has fundamental value. The copper lines they put down to transmit data carries value. The labor they put into the building of the network has value. 
These things give their payment network value because it allows it to exist and function.
The same way that miners burning energy to provide double spend protection for a instantaneous payment network makes the network inherently valuable. You cannot separate the miners from the network. These are essential gears in the cog. So you must establish all the cogs in the machine make the machine, and that the machine itself is inherently valuable because of the properties it has by default.

I think that these people have created labels for themselves, anchored their identities in this rhetoric, and because of that they have disillusioned themselves into believing things that are entirely irrational. This article on USC research helps explain the data better than I could -
If you would like to get much deeper into the subject, one must understand how belief systems are structured, how often we hold to those beliefs when questioned, and when do we start to move our belief systems. To get to your point, I think that the participators on have created people like Roger Ver as a "trusted node" in their "information/idea propagation network", and so therefore they assign a abnormally large amount of weight to their idea's, giving them credence and not challenging them, or challenging themselves when others in a "non-trusted network" (provide them with information contrary to their beliefs.
sci-hub.cc this article, its really good and goes into the data on the above-
In short, I do not believe its so much about paid shills as it is just about how idea's are spread organically throughout a network. It only takes 10-15% of the participants within a network to be firm on their convictions in order for that particular idea to be propagated across that network.
So ask yourself, do you think that 15% of are generally gullible and not educated enough to catch the false dichotomies that are being slanged around?
I think that number is closer to 70%. 
So you dont really need to pay people, you just need to convince a minority of gullible folks on of a idea and they will spread that idea for you and it will take hold.

Bitcoin cannot do that unless technologies like SW and LN are implemented. If they do not get in Bitcoin, they will get in alts. Code is already out of the bag.
So if Bitcoin is to remain on top we must upgrade it, asap. So that it can become bigger. 
Don't engage in a false dichotomy. There is a lot of technical middle ground to understand, and a lot of debt to incur trying to "go bigger" without the fixes SW implements. It was engineered for a reason......To fix problems that were preventing Bitcoin from removing the brakes, so to speak.

This would mean that your information would be embedded within the blockchain. Otherwise how could there be a chain of custody?
So how would that help the situation? Is the assumption that your information is already there, and therefore we might as well get the added benefit of being notified? Because its not. At least not in this crypto-envisioned scheme above.
Thats a major step backwards. We need freedom to possess our own information without relying on central organizations to be trusted platforms to hold our information for us.
To me, the goal is to make surveillance *expensive*. You must "go dark" to the way it was before computers by the broad utilization of encryption. We must take our privacy back to the way its always been before the advent of comupters. And its possible theoretically, but socially incredibly challenging.

No one is banned and anyone is welcome to voice their views.
For example, there are 3% of scientists who dont agree that global warming is caused by human industrialization and are often cited by oil industry executives and other industry propagandists. 
Now, going along that same vein, could you please list all of the engineers that have a problem with segwit codebase?
And before you say "jeff garzik", Jeff does not have any issues with SW code, he has a issue with deployment. Only gavin that I know of (and have at least some respect for) is against it because he's holding really hard to his on-chain ideologies. Garzik is a perfect example of a developer playing politics because his issue is not with the code.
So who do we have left?
Whoever you list, im going to list almost 100 times more developers who support SW.
Which means that we are roughly around the same % as consensus on global warming.
You are not a climate change denier are you? Well why not? The obvious (and only rational) answer is because 97% of the scientists around the world have examined the evidence and concluded that global warming is caused by man.
Are you now going to deny the 97%  (though really 99%) of bitcoin developers that have said "This is the best and the safest path forward" ?
Or are you going to deny that all of the experts have reached consensus? Because that would be sticking your head in the sand and going "la la la I cannnnt heaar youuuu" and would be immature and unintellectual. 


That is categorically false and for someone who's been around as long as you, you should be ashamed of yourself for spreading misinformation.

BU and folks have created a tribe for themselves, and to infer that their assessment is incorrect is to say "your tribe is stupid". They dont want their tribe to be stupid, so instead of accepting technological accumen, they outright reject it so that their identity systems are not challenged.
**So what  can we do about it?**


[You can see where I've discussed this happening before on this sub](


The emergent behaviors that come from the distribution of information from nodes within a network is a highly valuable resource to understand for effective communication.
*"A stupid man's report of what a clever man says can never be accurate because he unconsciously translates what he hears into something he can understand." -Bertrand Russell*
This is a great quote because it demonstrates exactly what is occurring. There are intelligent people like Peter R and John Ratcliff who have diverse opinions on the subject, and have convinced a minority of their belief systems, but the minority here is mostly uneducated people who are susceptible to groupthink mentality. You will see these people constantly attacking others in and parroting things, without really providing signal to the issue, and instead offering just a bunch of noise.[/endquote]
So, if we want to make change, then we must change the viewpoints of these highly trusted sources. The Gavin's, Jeff Garzik's, the Roger Ver's and whoever else is at war with the consensus of the majority of other engineers.

Except the vast majority of people who are involved with bitcoin do not code. They cannot appropriately examine the codebase to make determinations of value.

Nice claim. Is there any evidence to back such a statement up? Because the entire article was about how decades of research has shown fluoride to have great benefits with no measurable cost.
Are you aware that almost everything, in some form, is toxic? Fortunately a few million years of evolution has allowed us to deal with toxicity in a effective manner.
A great example is polyphenols. Did you know that they are actually toxic? Yea! That "really good stuff" is toxic.
What happens is the toxicity acts as a catalyst for anti-stress mechanisms that when activated do a lot of really helpful things inside our bodies. 
For all you know, fluoride acts the same way *plus* hardens enamel.

Do you think that AXA controls the views and actions of Blockstream? Because thats exactly what OP suggested.
If you think they do, I think you should really look into the legally binding contracts that Blockstream has with its employee's. You should also look into the history of the Founder and the philosophies he represents, aka CypherPunks.
These provided much needed context to the conspiracy theory being presented here.
The mentality being expressed by OP is that because Blockstream got funding from AXA that AXA controls Blockstream and therefore blockstream is "Big Oil" and is only here to profit off the back of us plebs wringing us dry of all our sustenance while they laugh at us in their ivory towers.
When you consider that Blockstream is *Adam Back* of Hashcash, a *fucking cypherpunk* for crying out loud, the entire thing is *laughable*.
These are contrarian views that are not founded in any logic. Its almost as if they are holding a mirror infront of the theory and getting the entire thing in reverse.
If we are to assume this person is not a sock puppet, then we must assume he actually believes this bullshit. Why would he believe it? Oh thats right, because Chinese Conglomerates and Bitcoin 8-9 Figure millionaire Evangelists have spawned this propaganda machine. Roger literally pays people to spread his misinformation. How is that not considered here?
They are guilty of the very thing that they accuse others of, projecting their ignorance at us and you think we should try to engage with them?
Sorry but no, fuck that and fuck them. They dont deserve engagement, they deserve ridicule and mocking. Frankly they deserve outright to be banned immediately from this sub without any discussion at all. When you shitpost conspiracy theory bullshit, you deserve to get called a conspiracy theory twat and banned. When you do it **on 4 week old accounts** then you are rightfully called a sock puppet.
You are not even following basic lines of logic here. How could a 4 week old account even know about AXA let alone fucking care? Clearly this is a sybil attack.
But what you are not thinking about is the *thousands* of sybil attacks we deal with in this community on a monthly basis. You are taking this *singular* issue and pretending its not spilled out to the entire community.

This entire post is based on a false assumption. SW Free's  up block space by moving the witness data, which allows for more tx's to fit in each block, which helps reduce congestion, which makes transactions confirm faster.
Also enables LN, which allows for instant confirmations. 
So, basically everything you wrote is a ignorant shitpost that ignores facts. Nice try though.

Disregard the other people, all I see is mostly ignorant replies. Its not wrong using some common sense to try to time your purchase. Entry point into the market is important for your ultimate return of value.
Considering the market had a slow organic building growth this entire year up to the 790 range, it is reasonable to assume that after all of this hype thats going on right now we will see it settle back in that area. I think we will keep a % of the gains from the rally, so my best bet is that we will see more shorts and then retracing back to the 850 range.
If you want to invest, then sign up on an exchange and put a order in to buy at 700 or 750. You might get lucky and on a downswing it will dip that low and your order will be there ready to fill.

Listen, you are going down a pointless rabbit hole. You are making assumptions on my stance that I never made. I am not against fixing problems.
Now, maybe I made a poor assumption here too. But you'll have to forgive me because you responded to a thread where the context was about Roger Ver, and his stance on being anti-segwit, and his advocating for hardforks. So going with the context, you claimed that chain splits are not necessarily bad, which under the circumstances heavily implies that you are pro-hardfork for bigger blocks, which directly implies anti-SW.
Both historically and generally speaking, I agree with you. There are instances in which when problems arise, we must fix them, and if the only way to fix them is with a hard fork then so be it. However, this is not a black and white discussion. Each and every situation has context and the outcome of each decision depends on the variables at play.
All I am trying to say is that advocating for a hardfork under the current circumstances is bat shit crazy. Its a 100% guaranteed chain split, **and absolutely not the good kind**. 
To simplify -
A chain split in which a minority hashpower remains **is bad**.
A chain split in which no minority hashpower remains **is ok**.
It should be noted that the 2nd circumstance is likely no longer possible. Which is why I said completely disillusioned from reality. Yes, I used the wrong word and yes your substitute is better.  Ironic that you accuse me of sidetracking and then attack my grammar. So anyone who attempts to make that argument is disconnected from reality. We cannot have a **"ok"** chain split any longer, unless it is to fix a bug that would destroy bitcoin. There is likely no circumstance for a *feature upgrade* that could obtain a non-contentious hardfork any longer. The current facts into the political division as they lay should be blindingly obvious to anyone that is the case.
I dont think bitcoin will ever be able to have a non-contentious HF ever again, minus a massive bug. The reasoning for my stance is because there is enough collusion on shorting the market with market participants, that a minority can hold hostage the entire network through utilizing socio-political methods to create division on issues.
This is why soft forks are so crucial. It eliminates that attack vector.

You absolutely can for the quadric sigops linear scaling attack vector.
You are referring to a entirely different attack vector, which is just a resource usage waste attack. This is much less damaging than the quadric attack, though still dangerous long term. This is why 4mb SW was such a large compromise to begin with.

@_date: 2017-08-04 02:22:30


First of all, thats never going to happen so thats just entirely unrealistic of an approach. 


The legacy chain will have at least 30% of current hashpower. Guarantee it. Willing to bet any amount of money you desire.
Its going to be extremely difficult for a single entity to attack the legacy chain when there are no single with over 30% hashpower. And if antpool decided to team up with viabtc and all their other chinese shill pools to attack the legacy chain? Good fucking riddance to segwit2x. That will be its doom. You think other miners are going to continue mining segwit2x after attacking the legacy chain?


You seem to be in the "miners control bitcoin" crowd, which clearly doesn't understand how bitcoin works. Nodes *enforce* the rules, and miners can mine whatever they want if they produce invalid blocks to 95% of the network then they will just get rejected. Sure, they can fire up their own nodes on their weak network and try to create *another* bitcoin fork.
We've already had one, why not another shit coin? Thats probably what is going to happen.
21M became 42M which will now become 63M.
@_date: 2016-06-16 16:04:29


I think you are correct in this assessment, however with blocks so near full we cannot be fully sure whether the recent filling is due to the bull ran and increased usage, or whether its a coordinated high paying spam attack.
This just gets into the endless loop of a question "If they pay, is it spam?"  Its very difficult to take a position one way or another.
When your local markets pay the mail man to stuff adverts into your mailbox, is it any less spam? But they paid for the services right? Just like these (possibly) attackers might be paying a higher price on their "spam" to fill the blocks. Its a relevant discussion that one must take into context. If block space was not a issue, then they would not have this attack vector. I would argue that it may not be spam, but anyone who purposefully spends the least amount possible with *only* the intention of throwing sand in the gears/filling up the blocks, that it should be considered a *attack on the network*. Its just difficult to prove.
We dont know for sure, because while a bull run would surely increase trading volume, im not sure how much of a impact that exchange trading volume would have on daily transactions. Since exchanges are their own database (not on chain), how much extra volume on-chain could we attribute to trading? Not very much I think.

Re-read my post. The only claim I made is that there exists data on the subject. Nothing I said was controversial. And are both of your guys hands broken that for some reason you are both incapable of using the search function? Does not surprise me one bit that those who spout ignorance don't want to research. That's the crux of it all, isn't it? Intellectual lazyness.
When someone says something *obviously stupid* by claiming data does not exist and I say "data does exist" there is absolutely no burden beyond dismissing the wild claim needed.
If he said "The sun doesn't rise everyday" would it be inappropriate for me to say "We have plenty of astrological data that shows the rotation of the planetary system"? Im not refuting the point, merely mentioning the data exists. 
The fact you are supporting this guy says a lot about you though ... No amount of proof or facts will change his mind.
While I get what you are saying as a generalization, it does not apply here because I refuted no point. Saying that information exists is not a refutation.....If you think so then you are on the same level as that guy.
I use mobile late at night and mobile is not conducive for research. When I'm on my desktop later I will spend 10 seconds using the search function. But not for you pathetic crybabies. For the other people here who are still learning and are actually willing to absorb and analyze information unlike those who have decided their emotions are all that's needed for intellectual debate.

Re-examine the situation when that occurs, many years in the future. The dynamic will be completely different because you will have multiple 2nd layer networks competing with each other. This adds compression to block space utilization, so it skews any current projected models we have on the utilization of blockspace.
Plus, we also cannot know the future improvements that will occur, future tech may add even more awsome compression features.
Trying to speculate now on a future where we will have no idea what the dynamics will be is pointless. Also, there is progress on safer paths forwards in the works in regards to hard forks, so hopefully it will be easier in the future.

Riiiiiight. Because it has nothing to do with chinese politcs, corruption or global demographics. Hey, how's KNC doing....? Oh yea, thats right, Sam Cole is on the record stating there's no way Bitmain could be profitable to the tune of 100's of millions of dollars of losses unless they had a [secret advantage](
You are delusional if you think that comparing manufacturers in the US, Canda or Sweeden to China is a "free market". They have different labor laws, environmental regulations etc, all that severely impact the cost of production. Thats not a free market. Because free markets dont exist.
The competitors lost to Bitmain specifically *because there is no free market* and they had not only the demographic and political advantage of being Chinese, but also because they had a secret advantage that they used in cheating Proof of Work to the tune of 100m a year.

Am I the only one that thinks recommending a corporate AML/KYC wallet is a bad idea for fungibility? Thats made by bitpay. And as awesome as those guys are acting as a bridge between bitcoin and fiat, as a bitcoin-only solution I see any corporate infrastructure as tainted by the legacy system. These companies have a legal requirement to federal agencies and when the warrant comes, they will cough up. They can be fully regulated and can be coerced into all kinds of damaging actions should the future play out in a way we bitcoiners do not like. And yes, maybe they have implemented various securities to remove some of that worst case scenario from happening, but they still control the servers you log into.
I also see everyone's knee jerk reaction to this as generally uneducated and irrational.
I think was acting incredibly irresponsibly when he advocated "boycotting" this BIP. As if there is a need. Why engage in politics when there is already a active consensus system that will get rid of poisonous BIP's ?
Now we have a fallout from a respected set of developers who were actively contributing to our community, and frankly Peter Todd is to blame. These guys have a great wallet and were just looking to improve it. So yea, maybe they didn't think how the BIP would be used for purposes not specific to their cause. So what? We have to bandwagon to "boycott" things now?
For fucks sake people, *calm down* and let the system work on its own. Especially you peter, that was reckless and irresponsible. 
You want to bring awareness to it? Great, do so! Dont do it by blaring your trumpets and demanding wars. Just write a blog post/reddit thread on why you think its a bad idea and let people digest it. Attempting to steer the community into a decision is absolutely the wrong way to handle things.
Keep your shitty politics out of bitcoin. You seem to be a pretty savvy developer and we respect you for that, but your lack of handle on your emotions in public are damaging. This is not the first time I've seen this drama queen flair, but these actions have repercussions beyond this BIP. Ironic isn't it?

The whole roger ver node being isolated has a extremely simple answer that im surprised didn't say.
Clearly this person setup some firewall rules and blocked connections. As much as people dislike roger ver, if he had money on his node and wanted to route, people would route through him. They would do it because LN is not a visual representation. You don't touch a screen and select a hub by name when trying to send a transaction, the software has a routing algorithm that determines the most efficient path to pay, and the user has no idea what hubs he is routing through.
The fact that roger thinks this is "proof" shows what a moron he is. He's the gullible idiot on facebook that believes in chemtrails are real because he saw a post about some guy who said he was a pilot and saw his buddies do it.
Like, dur....its on the internet, it must be trues!!11!1!

They do not accept evidence as a rational counter argument. They cannot see that a *contentious* HF is horrible and therefore can bring no good. They are blinded by the propaganda of this "90%" metric which is only measured by central actors who do not control the 90% they claim they do. Which we will see in November.
It's the same sacrifice long term security for short term benefit argument that leads to the destruction of all things good. I don't care about the short term business/profit models of bitpay/DCG. They don't own the network and don't get to enforce rules upon everyone else.
The stupid part is they will get exactly what they want with SW+LN. If they would not fall for the spam attacks and accept we now have in place the system to defeat those things long term we would not need to risk the network to such rushed and poorly planned changes.

Which is exactly why we are going to see networks like lightning become extremely successful. They emulate the properties of a traditional credit system in that they can instantly transact IOUs with nearly the same security is the Bitcoin blockchain but without all of the friction that the first layer has. 
What the vast majority of the newcomers and a loud minority of current bitcoiners don't understand simply because they are not highly technical or seasoned engineer's is that there are not Simple Solutions to complex problems. The Simple Solution is the one we already have which is creating centrally controlled actors that act as intermediaries providing liquidity to a credit-based IOU system. If we want to do that without the central actors, hence Bitcoin, then we need to design trustless decentralized systems which are by their nature highly complex.
You can't have your ice cream and eat your cake too. Things cannot be both simple and complex at the same time and people need to deal with basic facts to come to rational conclusions.
But we can have our ice cream and cake to when it comes to getting cheap fast reliable instant payments both small and large but it's going to require complex design choices that will take time and resources to adopt. Luckily we have some of the most brilliant Engineers on the planet working in Bitcoin land and they have been working on exactly these solutions for years now and we are near ready to Launch.
In a few years all of these problems will be behind us and these arguments simply won't exist anymore. For now keep fighting the ignorance and pushing forward.

Is this calculating in the price of the BCH? 75% of 15 blocks comes out to 140 BCH, which if we take the avg price of $450 = 63k
This is all assuming he can actually get that much for that BCH when they can actually spend it, but if they keep mining it then they get quicker to their reward.

So basically all of the most knowledgeable engineers are wrong and you are right. Sorry but when people like nullc and Peter Todd say point blank "this does not fix the sigops attack vector" they are lying?
You'll have to forgive me if I believe them over some dude on Reddit. To those who are going to cry "appeal to Authority", yes, that's exactly what you should be doing when there are technical variables beyond your professional academia.
And nothing you said changes my perspective. A user who can craft a 7.99mb malicious transaction is a serious threat to the resource model of a decentralized network. This is about designing a system that does not over extend itself in ways that erodes security.
A 5mb or 6mb or 7mb or 7.99mb possible blocksize is a poor design choice that sacrifices long term security for short term profit. That is a greedy and stupid choice for a network that retains value through it's anti fragility.
And there is plenty of research that backs up my opinion. Both the Cornell study and the bitfury whitepaper demonstrate that blocks over 4mb are catastrophic to decentralization.

You can see in this thread how proton talks about how they don't allow automatic sign up paid in BTC because of one confirmation taking a long time.
This is where lightning networks is really going to shine it will create an incentive for people like proton to default their payment system to lightning Network so that the confirmation is instant so that they can enable instant account activation and still keep spam minimized.

Yes I do. You don't need inside knowledge to point at a tree to say "this is a tree". When someone makes a obviously unqualified statement you don't need to know their life story to point out what is obvious.
He is welcome to provide credentials, but I would put money on zero experience in cryptography or distributed systems design. 


This is blantantly false. Quit spreading misinformation. The entire industry reached consensus on SW a year ago. Just because a single mining cartel uses a minority veto to prevent activation does not mean that everyone else did not agree. You are lacking in facts and knowledge on the subject.


Yes, it would have been proposed as a 1mb proposal. The fact that it was 4mb was the compromise. Don't take my word for it, Bitcoin core top contributors have publicly stated this was a compromise hundreds if not thousands of times.
It sounds like you don't know wtf you are talking about. Maybe you should spend less time in Looney land and more time reading facts.

From the guy who sets entirely unrealistic roadmaps for coding and testing? It would have been hasty code and little to no testing regardless of what the situation. UASF did not change the goalposts in any way in regards to timeliness or release dates.
Also, that "hasty code" you speak of was BIP91 and as you can see it worked fine. The reason is because SegWit, which *was not hasty code* had already been deployed and tested **for a year**. 
It just needed some minor adjustments to say "If these clients produce this block, allow, if not, disallow". It was 1st grade math compared to the cryptography that core devs are putting out.

I agree with you and have made this same statement many times. In reality, I put AA somewhere on the bottom of the "3rd party developer" spectrum. He can code, he's taken a lot of time to examine the issues, but he's not really a expert on the codebase when we compare him to any of the 100 core dev's, or any of the active developers who are working on some of the better wallet softwares, alternative implementations, etc.
Im sure many alt-coin developers probably know more about bitcoin than Andreas does. Because they at least dive into the codebase on the regular not just by examining, but by changing and experimenting.
Note I said "you or I", meaning, specifically myself and the person I was replying to. There are plenty of members in this subreddit that I would pick over AA to make qualified statements on the code.

There's plenty of time and Bitcoin will work fine forever with 1mb, it will just be very expensive to use. I'm OK with that.

2mb HF + SW = 8MB possible total blocksize. At 1MB we have 4MB of total blocksize, and naturally at 2MB non-witness we have a possibility for 8MB. I dont know where your getting your data from, but thats inaccurate. 


RPI's would be immediately rendered useless with blocksize upgrades. I know, I have one and ran it as a node for quite some time. I stopped because it couldn't really handle the load as-is.  So I'll rely on my experience instead of your claims. 


A commercial line that can be censored at any time by any state authority? You are not focusing on the bigger picture here, and this is such a basic concept its mind blowing you dont think of it. Decentralization is not commercial lines. Decentralization is home users. Its very easy to censor/attack/remove commercial servers. 
Any changes that reasonably damage the node count of **non-commercial** nodes is a serious attack vector upon the security of bitcoin.


I can confirm that his node does more traffic than mine. But its not out worldly, and is still a good example. We want nodes to be optimal, do we not? 


Facts pulled out of your ass. Put them back in there where they belong. Categorically false.


Also false.


This is showing your ignorance on the subject. A node in your home is owned by you. A node owned in a data center is not. We have this little thing called "the constitution" and "rights" that gives personal ownership much more strength and resiliance to attack. This applies to non-US based countries as well who have similar sovereignty.

Its a centralized china coin with no inherent value. It offers no advancements, has no real development team, and what little contributors they have are woefully under-experienced and can bring nothing of innovative value to the plate.
They will just copy/paste everything from bitcoin core to their repo.
Why should anyone support the copiers when we have the real deal?
Segwit2x will make bcash pointless. It will have all the latest tech, greater efficiency and bandwidth and the support of the industry.
Not to mention the economics of mining incentives are way way *way* off, so good luck finding hashpower to suppor the network. Remember that at *any* moment it can be 51% attacked by a large miner.

So....bill that introduces regulation.....to prevent regulation? Sorry no thanks. They want a centralized coin they can censor and that's not how these systems work. They are just too archaic to understand the Dynamics.
This is like the first amendment. You cannot pick and choose specific speech to censor, it's all or none. With freedom comes all the bad shit with it. This is why we devote public subsidy to enforcement, because it's the only way. Police, FBI, etc are all 2nd layer services that have to deal with the network traffic created by the 1st amendment. Pedos, Nazi's etc will get their free speech too, but it's up to us as a society to make sure their speech does not turn to action that infringes upon the rights of others.
They must use 2nd layer services to deal with domestic crime committed with cryptocurrencies the same way they do with dollars.

That reduces fee revenue. Why would miners want to reduce fee revenue? [There's even good evidence that Antpool is behind the spam attacks as they recently just got caught collecting all their low-fee spam tx's while ignoring bigger money on the plate]( Miners like high fee revenue, its more profit, and as simple as that. So they are perpetuating spam attacks to increase the fee revenue.


Because you've not thought this through very much. If you had, you wouldn't have said silly things like you just did that are easily refuted with common sense if you understand the game theory involved.

I dont think you really understand the technical nature of these fixes. The witness block has to exist in order to fix malleability. Is that what you are trying to say? That we could have somehow magically fixed malleability without SW? 
You should read up on the history of bitcoin. There have been a half dozen or so reasonable attempts to fix the issue and all of them have been insufficient. This was the best way to do it.
The problem is that non-technical people dont understand the engineering and mathematics behind all of this, and think that their non-technical thoughts and emotions matter more than people who have devoted their lives to a specific science or academia and dedicated their knowledge to bitcoin.

Pure speculation of course, because I think Roger will just make a alt account and continue trolling, with enough people in the know (mods, friends) upvoted his comments that he will quickly re-establish his foothold, though less effective. And he will just write blogs which will get great traction there. The goal post shifters will just assign blame to Greg for arguing against someone who isn't there.

Yes and no. I wouldn't say terrified. But I would say that im definitely concerned with the centralization and monopolization of resources within the bitcoin system, and how those central actors have behaved in clearly damaging ways to the ecosystem. 
Bitcoins strongest feature is its decentralization and resistence against central control. When you have a single chinese douche manufacturing 75% of ASICs, thats a big fucking problem. 
We can only hope that he will take all of his toxicity to BCH, but I have a feeling he will stick around and be a parasite in our ecosystem instead.
I see that you are one of those free market delusionalists. 
Got news for you - Free markets dont exist. Anywhere. Ever. And if you think bitcoin is a free market you are smoking crack. Money/Power *always* consolidates and influences networks and bitcoin while as awesome as it is, is not entirely resistant to these standard mechanisms. See bitmain as proof.
We've already had it clearly demonstrated with asicboost that consolidated power is more than willing to work against the networks best interest, to sabotage long term progress for short term profits.
Your market philosophy is flawed. All markets get gamed. Our "market" is determined by central exchanges. When we are running 100% on full decentralized exchanges with proof-of-reserves and no central actors, then we can have a conversation about "free markets".
Until then, you are naive if you think that markets are not gamed.
You should read Thomas Piketty's capitalism. He proves conclusively that "free market" ideology is heavily flawed and that the most optimal societies have always been those with regulations that enable fair socioeconomic rules that benefits the public. He does it with big data scientists by examining the last 600 years of civilizations economic data.

You deny its evidence, which is reasonable considering all we have is the word of the DOJ and not the evidence hearings. I get it. 
Im not a statist, but I think they are probably making accurate claims in this situation.

Satoshi was wrong. Get over it he's not a god. You cannot have a decentralized system with central node operators.

This is a very valid point and goes into the heart of bitcoin. These people are users within the system simply excercising their rights in a way that serves their best interests against centralized forces trying to maximize theirs.
One could rationally argue that both unions and corporations are simply self-balancing entities within a market system, both equally as important to the balance of fairness and price discovery.

A lot can change in a few months in bitcoinland. Especially when big blockers now have their fantasy 8MB hardfork.
I think you'll find the resistance from users will greatly weaken the resolve of many of these NYA signatories, especially since Core is not going to follow. They will continue to release software *not* with the 2MB hardfork code, so that is going to put enormous pressure on these industry folks to choose wisely.
Also, you cannot force the 95% of the node operators to switch to Segwit2x. Good luck with that! Miners can mine a shitcoin like Bcash all they want, doesn't mean that the economic activity will follow.

I'll expand because you seem a little slow -
Economic incentives is the reason bitcoin exists.
You are going to feel like a complete idiot when segwit rolls out of the gates with a huge support backbone from the community. Do you really think that all the major developers are just sitting around with their thumbs up their buttholes waiting for SW to be deployed?
No, they are actively coding to support it natively at launch. I've seen this admission not only from major wallet providers, but even from one-man workshop projects.

Good words. I see too much talk of "pumping" ....people who use that word dont understand how organic the market is, nor do they comprehend how much money it takes to move the market.
The only pumping that could have occurred would be from a nation state deciding to play around with their treasury by speculating in bitcoin. No one else throws that kind of money into speculating on bitcoin. That would just be grossly stupid and I cannot imagine billionaires being grossly stupid (with their money). That was something that was only possible when there was just MtGox and 1/16th of the daily trading volume.
The reality is we are now in a global market with liquid exchanges around the world operating mostly in tandem. So while a exchange can take the lead and others can follow, there still needs to be buyers spread across all of those exchanges around the world to eat those books. 
Thinking thats a pump is a conspiracy theory. 
No one knows the mind of the market. I'll never understand why people still buy after the market has clearly been overbought. I mean, I do understand the fragility of the human psyche and the reasons why we do the things we do, but I cannot rationalize it.

Here's my ELI5 attempt to help people who just dont get it to understand what SW does and how it effects blockspace. Currently, there is one yellow bus that takes elves to the bank on Blockchain Ave. It carries 10 elves. The elves normally just carry as much gold as they can in their hands and get on the bus.
Segwit adds another 3 green buses that attach to the end of the yellow bus making one super hip yellow and green bus.  Those additional 3 buses are each individually not as big as the yellow bus, but they utilize compartment space differently so that the elves can board and store nifty backpacks made of elven silk that can carry several times more gold than they could normally carry with their hands.
If the elves only carry gold in their hands, then the new super hip bus allows 17 to 21 elves to be transported. If the elves do not carry extra backpacks, then the 3rd and 4th green bus do not show up to carry the kids to school. They are only hired if the kids bring more backpacks.
But if the elves are carrying backpacks, the new buses allow for up to 40 elves backpacks and around 20 elves, effectively doubling the amount of elves that can go on the bus, and quadrupling the amount of gold that can be transported to the bank to be protected by the Elven Ledger Queen.
More importantly than the extra space it gives for the elves and their backpacks, it adds a new Identity Check (malleability fix)when boarding. Unfortunately, there have been issues in the past of garden gnomes pretending to be elves, getting on the bus, and then stealing gold from the elves. This new bus system puts an ID check into place that prevents the thieving garden gnomes from getting on the bus.
This security feature will allow for a new type of *red* buses (LN) to operate around the entire world, and not just in this one small town, so that elves can take buses to the bank everywhere. These red buses all for near unlimited space to transport elves and at such a cheap price that everyone can afford it.
I would appreciate it if those more technically inclined could improve this analogy for me to make it more accurate.

Those points have little to do with the context of "edge use cases". Also I find it ironic that they warn about following a "invalid" fork when they are the ones trying to change consensus rules against the ecosystem, which will create a fork with invalid rulesets. The network is already upgraded to SW so SW is the valid ruleset. Hashpower won't change that.

Have you tried to engage in game theory on the subject?
Censorship is about collusion or forced action from a regulatory entity. Take Garzik for Example, running Bloq and [aquiring skry to "supercharge blockchain analytics"]( who will work with government or private entities to identify and track coin movements.
Whats to stop the Chinese government from creating their own R&amp;D Bloq like company, and then telling companies like Bitmain "Comply with our regulations measures or have all your property confiscated" ?
This is why centralization of miners was always the biggest threat model to bitcoin. Because once you become big enough you can attack (or get hacked and let the hacker attack, or get compromised, and have the compromiser attack) the network in extremely disruptive ways.
This is why projects like MimbleWimble is so important. Fungibility at a protocol level must be solved so that financial sovereignty can be preserved.

Listen you need to stop saying that no one cares first of all. Do you know how many software engineer friends that I have that don't have a f****** clue what Bitcoin is or how it works? 
Just because you can write code does not make you an expert at distributed systems. It does not make you an expert at cryptography. It does not make you an expert on consensus systems. It does not make you an expert in human psychology. It does not make you an expert in economics.
Why do you think that's so many of us look up to people like Nick Szabo? Because he actually is an expert in nearly all of those fields and on top of it he has Decades of experience in cryptographic distributed systems. People like Adam back is also one of those extremely extremely rare people who is talented across multiple platforms related to these systems and with Decades of experience.
Saying over and over and over "I am a software engineer" doesn't qualify jackshit.

Did you not understand my post? It appears you missed my main point. Your estimates are no where near accurate and nothing you replied with is going to change that.
If we must limit our nodes then we are limiting our resources. Whats the point of running a node if you are going to hamstring it?
Thats like buying a ferarri to drive in a 25mph school zone only. 
The bigger point here is to make the network as efficient as possible since ballooning is going to happen regardless so we must focus on efficiency first. If we do not, then we will end up with a stangant bloated network that is crippled and worthless. A dumb blocksize increase is like making your business footprint larger while ignoring the maximum occupancy limits for fire hazards.
A centralized bitcoin is not bitcoin and not valuable.

I dont know about anyone else but im pretty confident that Roger did this to receive access to his gox coins. It was a quid pro quo.
Why else would he say such blatantly false things? Not that everything he said there was false, there was a lot of truth in that statement and he's hid behind those loose truths while defending himself.
But the common interpretation of his statement was "Gox is not having liquidity problems". Yet they obviously were, thats not in question. The past is 20/20 and we know for a fact they were having serious liquidity issues at the time of that statement.
Yes, it was BTC liquidity, but he said "Im sure **all the withdrawal problems** are caused by the traditional banking system", which includes BTC withdrawals, and then went on to say "Not because of a lack of liquidity at Mt Gox".
Yet that was demonstrably false. There absolutely was a liquidity problem and that was the entire reason for the lack of withdrawals. He tried to play it off saying that he was only referencing the bank accounts liquidity, but thats not what he said. He grouped and generalized which was inclusive of bitcoin.
I dont know how anyone can defend this fraudster, let alone cheerlead for him.

Today a decade-long government policy of subsidizing oil prices has ended. Mexico has actually been sending oil to the United States 4 refining because of how expensive it is to do it there.
The government has historically subsidized the gas industry so that it could control inflation. But now that that period has ended we are going to see some really massive inflation start to take root. The Mexican currency has lost 40% of its value against the United States dollar in recent times. So Mexico is going to be the next Venezuela.

I dont think you are in any position to postulate your opinion. We have several years of engineering work pending activation and the only reason its not activated is because a vocal non-technical minority is outspoken against non-technical issues.
If you dont think thats politics then you you either -
1) Dont understand the meaning of politics
2) dont grasp the entirety of the picture
Those who have invested enormous personal time into studying and understanding the technical merrits of SW/LN clearly see that there is *literally no debt to speak of* and *nothing but benefits*. We are not talking about just the 100+ engineers and mathematicians who approve of this but also the majority of the developers within the community. As in, the people who actually know wtf they are doing, unlike the people who are not engineers shouting their opinions over the top of everyone else, aka vocal non-technical minority.
The entire argument from the minority is basically "Well we didn't get it *exactly* the way we wanted it, so we are going to oppose this tooth and nail".
Not to mention that there are some pretty serious issues that are going to be fixed upon activation. Which just makes the minority look like violent extremists who wish harm to the health of the network under the guise of "We just have different ideologies on the path forward" ....well those different ideologies are extremely harmful to bitcoin. 
Also, Charlie has a good point [here]( .....and I believe it fully shows how this is merely political posturing and nothing less.

 A Rational compromise when it comes to engineering trade-offs will concern technical merits being weighed and then determining if the benefit outweighs the cost. 
Absolutely none of that happened in this circumstance. This rational compromise you speak of is 100% politics and has no merit in regards to technical arguments. That makes this a completely irrational compromise if you can even call it a compromise to begin with.
Rational engineer's will collect data from proposed changes before they introduce major changes to the system that affects everyone in a non backwards compatible way.
What you are going to find in the next few months is that the system is going to be working great and the resource usage will be at all-time lows now that we have finally implemented technologies that increase the efficiency of transactional bandwidth and resource usage.
For this reason segwit 2x is an entirely irrational compromise because it puts the cart before the horse.

There will always be competition within the market. Expecting otherwise is delusional. Bitcoin is not a transformer. Your expectations that Bitcoin can be both decentralized and yet retain the properties of a centralized network is irrational. Bitcoin cannot compete with shitcoin ABC with 10000x less load and centralized infrastructure.
More importantly, it does not need to. It merely needs to remain decentralized and be anti fragile and it will win the market.
Pretending that Bitcoin is not the center of innovation is living in a fantasy. Most development resources are being poured into Bitcoin. ETH is next best, but ETH is centralized and diff use case than Bitcoin. It is the corporate coin to the liberty reserve dollar.
BTC will win because it will innovate and expand. Not by being a monkey and doing a "simple" BS increase, but instead by being intelligent and nimble, focusing on efficiency and resource management.

So when bitmain stalled progress for a year to preserve asicboost profits, that had bitcoins interest at best heart?
When they [mined spam transactions instead of regular tx's]( were they also looking out for the best interests of bitcoin?
I think you need to accept that there are actors within our ecosystem that have perverse incentives. If you refuse to acknowledge these facts then you are only contributing to the problem by enabling other people to propagate this falty information in an attempt to steer the narrative towards industry perspective. You also need to recognize that this actor is a monopoly in the industry that has way way *way* too much power as-is.
Don't you recall how they blocked SW on LTC, and only after the threat of a UASF did they sing a different tune? Why did they attempt to block SW in the first place? Not the conspiracy theory reason why, but the *actual economic reason*.
If bitcoin is decided by market forces, then you would need to accept that either there are rational economic choices that go against the networks best interest, or there are irrational actors making non-economic choices.
I personally think its a combination of the two. I think there are economic incentives that are mis-aligned with whats best for bitcoin (asicboost, spamming the blockchain to game the fee algos), as well as idelogical preference governed by identity politics.
In order for bitcoin to succeed we must remain vigilent against industry takeovers. That includes chinese monopolies, billionare VC groups and the like. I dont care how much Silbert has done for bitcoin. No one asked for his help and there was never a contract that said if you pour your money into our open source industry we will give you the keys to our system.
If Industry can take away the decision making process from the users, then bitcoin has failed in its mission. Remember what was written in the genesis block. Bitcoin is a tool for massive economic change but this change cannot occur if our ecosystem is controlled by central actors.

You are correct. The issue goes a little deeper than that and I've actually asked adam for clearer business goals stated as well years in the past. However its easy to overlook what is [right in front of your face](
Blockstream has a for-profit product called liquid that will be used to provide cross-exchange liquidity.
Do not confuse that with lightning network **which is NOT a product of blockstreams**.
Lighting Network is a open source project that blockstream has decided to help contribute to because they believe in funding open source development of fundamental infrastructure that will benefit their long term investment plans, which is to say "anything that benefits bitcoin". Those investment plans being products like Liquid, which will generate revenue for the company.
In order to take in the scope of your message, and the implied conspiracy theory, you have to remind yourself over and over and over -
Blockstream does not own, nor did it create, Lightning Network. There is no single implementation of LN, and there are currently like 5+ public implementations of LN. roasbeef has focused on cross-LN implementation compatibility so that all LN implementations can compete in a fair open market platform.
So the entire conspiracy theory falls apart on that fact alone. If you take eric's tweet, and combine it with basic knowledge and public facts surrounding blockstream, you can clearly see which entities are the ones doing damage, and which entities are the ones trying to progress the procotols forward to create a safer, scalable bitcoin.
Considering that [Antpool got caught red handed in spam tx collection]( has lobbied its chinese subsidaries (roughly 40% of hashrate) for the past year and a half to block all progress forward on upgrades, and patented a covert asicboost that intentionally cheats proof of work to shortcut the process while screwing over the network by not including transactions, its pretty crystal clear who the malicious actors are and who the benevolent actors are.
We know who's collecting the extra 20k of fee's per block, and its not blockstream. Its miners. Its time we recognize basic facts and move forward to a bigger better bitcoin.

The only problem is non-intellectuals who deny the scope. The problem is complex technically, the problem is complex socially, and the problem is complex economically.
You are new here, so sorry if I call out your bullshit. But there are not simple solutions to complex problems and pretending there is no complexity only demonstrates that **you don't understand the problems**.
All systems made up of millions of humans and computers are complex by default. Stop denying water is wet. If it was simple we would have resolved it long ago. The basic fact we haven't highlights the complexity of upgrading decentralized systems. Don't blow smoke up people's asses while saying the sun doesn't rise in the east.

Ok. No problem.


No one "turns bitcoin" into anything. This is an open source consensus driven network. Perhaps a better way to phrase it would be "*Mostly* Everyone has (yet to be seen) decided to turn bitcoin into a private settlement system". Remember bitcoin is permissionless. Anyone can join in, fork the code, run their own codebase, gather a crowd, etc. Also remember its consensus driven, so wherever bitcoin goes, that is the vast majority of the network specifically agreeing to the direction it goes. If there are major changes enacted, that means almost everyone has agreed to them.


Pray, do tell me about hub and spoke models and how they "naturally" turn systems into a settlement layers. Could you please back that statement up with historical data to represent your theory? 
Most people who actually understand decentralized networks would see hub and spoke models as simply another distributed system, with costs and benefits. Like everything else in life. Your feeble attempts to declare a moralistic implication towards hub and spoke models show you have little understanding of distributed networks.


Oh hey! Something we can agree on.....*wait*....did you really think that LN can exist *without* bitcoin? Well, nevermind, looks like you fooled me for a second, I thought you might have had a rational thought in your mind but my bad, looks like more hyperbole bullshit instead.


Well, there's a lot going on here. First, I would just point out that in order to secure the network there needs to be an economic incentive, which won't exist when subsidies diminish, and tx fee's are the *only* current way that can supplement miners to secure the network in replacement for those subsidies.
But 2nd, what does it matter if there is a $100 tx fee if that means 1+ million LN transactions that use that single fee as the settlement transaction for those payment channels? Thats literally the best of both worlds....super cheap microtransaction capabilities for bob and alice who want to buy coffee and pay their browsers ad revenue subsidy, plus a reasonable fee for miners who no longer have block reward subsidy to pay them for their work. Please bear in mind this is discussion about the future, not today, so keep that in context while your brain cogs are clicking.


Could you please show me where "Core" has taken a single penny from blockstream? Because as I understand it, Blockstream is an organization that develops software solutions and is independently funded. There are developers who are both open source contributors towards the bitcoin protocol and contributors towards blockstream products. Which is fucking awesome by the way, really amazing that there are well funded organizations who are willing to shell out $$$ towards development towads an open source protocol.
Or were you just expecting altruistic folks to pick up the tab for the world? If so, that's rather naive for you, especially naive considering bitcoin the system specifically runs on anti-alturistic theory and instead relies on economic incentives to drive an optimal equilibrium. 


[Uhmmm, ok!]( The only thing lacking is your education on the topic and why things are moving at the rate they are. Building decentralized systems that are secure is enormously difficult. Doing so *safely* adds exponential security issues on top of that weight. If you want instantly scaling systems, then why dont you use paypal? Or VISA? Or Diners Club? For those who are not ignorant however, we understand that there are attack vectors present in bitcoin and waiting to be exploited by the world. The *safe* progress that is being made on bitcoin is something that occurs over *years*, not days, or months, and your immature persistence that *"we need it NOW"* is just a example of whiney shit smeared kids crying about how they want candy NOW. 


And the final nail in the coffin that you are living a complete delusional fantasy.  Seriously, LN is not adding scaling? Alpha? Sidechains?
Here, you should read this -

What virtue is signaling?
I dont think you understand this phrase. Its intended to be used as a personal application, e.g. applying to self.

In this case, OP is not signaling anything. He's just "talking up" BlockStream for doing something. Something, that, you, and I, and the entire community, should be incredibly thankful for.
I see no problem in him using positive social reinforcement. God knows there is just a *fuckload* of negative attacks constantly being spewed in their direction. Are you really so blind as to not see that, and to not be compassionate enough to understand we need to balance that shit out?

Antpool is currently positive 18.12% when they were negative almost that same exact amount this time yesterday.
ViaBTC is currently positive 26.93% when they were negative almost that same exact amount this time yesterday.
Did they *already* abandon their little pet project? Why would they even bother to mine it for the first 11 blocks? Maybe they have decided its better to let time expire, difficulty drop and start mining it with more advantageous conditions?
Thats the only rational conclusion I can come to. Unless they already sold all their BCH on ViaBTC and are exiting the market with their purses heavy.
EDIT - Of course the minute I posted this [blocks 571 and 572 were found]( so the "no blocks for 13 hours" bit is no longer true.
Rational conclusion  - They have already sold all their bch on ViaBTC and have exited the market. It really would be an ingenious dine &amp; dash plan to cook up. What do they care about reputation when they mine? Blocks rewards aint biased.

The point tony is getting at guys is you are subsidizing your trust. Bitcoin is a trustless system and you are relying upon 3rd parties and trusting them with your money.
Which isn't necessarily a bad thing if you are educated and not dealing with large sums.
I see their point too tony. You dont *really* need to run a node to transact and if bitcoin requires everyone to run a node then its failed as a non-starter. We just need enough nodes for reasonable security. There must be reputation systems built for frictionless transacting. There are advantages to the centralization of some services with obvious tradeoffs.
Which is why LN is so awesome. It allows you to operate in a SPV mode and instantly transact sums with near-bitcoin security.
But even LN will require 3rd party servicers to watch channels for foul play! So theres a bigger picture here and that is all systems must do tradeoffs in order to gain efficiencies.

Why complain about the problem when it's your service that's causing it? You would think such a service provider would be more supportive of SW and LN (as well as schnorr, MAST and etc that core devs are creating) since it fixes the issue they complain about. But no, instead they want to kick the can and force extra resources on node operators through a contentious hard fork that will really destruction upon the network.
Typical industry playing card. No different than manufacturing poisoning rivers and complaining about regulation. Passing the long term buck on the backs of users all while profiting off their product. Who cares about long term security? We got short term profit to worry about and to hell with everyone!

This is a really dumb perspective. Bitcoin must remain anti fragile to be valuable. It's not about what will be used by economic activity, it's about what attack vectors exist.
A 8mb blocksize will create a large attack surface. You do not purposefully design weakness into systems that survive only by their resilience to attacks.
I see why you say the dumb shit you do. It's because you have no foresight. You are not thinking about game theory or security. You should leave design choices to the experts in the field.
This is blantant anti intellectualism.

I think this along with recent progress stalling tactics from Bitmain proves that economic incentives are not perfectly aligned with what's best for the network.
It is possible to game the system in ways that hurts the network and helps the miner. It's also frustrating to watch them behave in ways that prevents the price from increasing, which any rational actor in the space would embrace for their own economic benefit. Clearly Bitmain is a irrational actor, or they have bets on horses we are unaware of, market shorts, alts, etc. We know Roger is a alt investor so we can rationalize some of his destructive behavior as simply placing bets on competitors but we didnt really have any confirmation of that from bitmain until now with the bcash drama. 
In this case Antpool has an economic incentive to keep fees high in order to increase future block revenue and to promote their shitcoin Fork. Before it was asicboost, now it's spam, what other shitty things will Antpool think of next? Thank goodness SW is around the corner.
This is proof also that the bitcoinABC crew are going to stick around and poison the well as much as possible. Fuck these people. Anyone who defends bitmain is part of the poison.

Yes, I do mean the Bitmain that is currently funding development for BitcoinABC and [currently has a -13% reduction of hashing power over the last 24 hours via Antpool]( Are we to suggest that magical miner fairies went into antpool and stole that specified sha256 hashpower into the ether? 
You think that just because bitmain is mining bitcoin that it means they are not supporting BitcoinABC/BCH? It of course means no such thing.
You are basically saying that you cannot bet on multiple horses in the race. The evidence clearly demonstrates Bitmain putting large resources into BitcoinABC/BCH.
Listen Erik, you want to stick your head in the sand about Jihan and his vehement battle against Segwit, Core and LN, fine. I wont ignore his documented positions over the last year specifically *against* segwit.
You can pretend that he's "come around" and "learned his lesson" while I accept that he will continue to do whats profitable....which is mine bitcoin, while he continues to try to undermine the reference client by funding development of consensus-breaking alternative clients.
The only thing I see going on here is that Jihan has decided to play nicely in the sandbox because he's realized that he cannot win the consensus battle on the frontlines with his brute force tactics. So he's going to continue to mine and earn profits while he sends spies into the rear of the battle and infiltrates his opposition in an attempt to divide and conquer.

Someone is living a delusional reality. Things dont change overnight, and they dont even change over a few years. If you thought so, or others thought so, you were all delusional. I see bitcoin as a 10-20 year impact for real change. Anyone who thinks otherwise you should ignore.


Says who? Where? If im remembering correctly, coinbase says they have 5+ million users. Thats pretty fucking good for one single provider. And thats a regulated exchange. I can only imagine how many users there are who are not american or who prefer to keep anonymous.

This is where Peter Todd shines. We need more people who are constantly immersed in the world of malicious actors attempting to exploit the system.
Because, *there is*.
I can think of a few ideologies that follow this philosophical path of logical assumptions, where you think "No one would do this because of A) B) and C)" ....but there are always going to be illogical actors, and actors who are aware of things you are not, so things that may be irrational to you are rational to others.
For example....
The economic system of bitcoin at a large glance works. Yet what if we assume that bitcoin is threatening state sanctioned central banks?
Suddenly extremely powerful actors have a financial interest to attack bitcoin, where we always assumed everyone had a financial interest to invest into bitcoin. And while you might counter that with "it would make more sense for these states to just invest into bitcoin rather than attack it" ...that would be following the same flawed logic Gavin would approach it with! We cannot presume all actors are rational!

You are not taking into account the amount of connections each node has and how often this data is replicated by being sent to its peers. I see this misunderstanding quite often in people who try to simplify these discussions. The truth is is that the effect is nonlinear you cannot quantify it you have no idea how much bandwidth each node is going to use because it's solely depends upon its connectivity and its settings.
If you attempt to quantify the transactional Thoreau put and block sizes into a static number then I suggest you times that between 20 and 100 and that's more or less what it would really be. It's really simple to determine this if you run a node like I do and I encourage other people to run node so that they can actually understand how much bandwidth it takes. Just do the basic calculations on block sizes 1 Megabyte every 10 minutes 6 an hour 24 hours...144mb per day right? No wrong, couldn't be further from the truth.  That's 4.3gb in **upstream** bandwidth per month .... But the reality is that it's closer to 100 GB with default configurations.
That's 25x your basic assumptions.
I see you arguing very passionately about this topic but I also see that you don't even have basic facts right about this topic. I think that you need more education so that you can come to more realistic understandings as to what the actual resource usages will be.

The only "spat" I've seen is very briefly from Peter Todd on something years ago, and a few questionable personal stances from luke-jr.

This is merely a signal to noise ratio issue. You are presuming that the noise you hear is valid and you have chosen to ignore the quality signal that is present.
I on the other hand have chosen to focus on the signal. I have seen it discussed ad nauseam that the 2013 speculative bubble was just that, a speculative bubble. I've seen price data that clearly shows a ramp up in the price over an extremely short period of time and if you'll recall the all time high only lasted less than a day.
Whereas now you can see that the price has been slowly climbing with more appropriate retracing that signifies a healthy established price.
People who thought that we'd be in the thousands right now we're wrong and they were not basing their speculation on anything other than the emotional fever that people experience during speculative bubbles. You should stop listening to those people.

No, those are not advancements. Replay attack is a fundamental requirement for a fork to succeed. Its not an advancement, especially not since the concept has been around for years and utilized already in many alts.
A blocksize increase is also not an advancement. Especially not when you weigh the cost vs benefit relationship in the long run. Its a parameter that could be changed by a 5 year old at any time in the code. Changing a configuration in your software is not an "advancement" its simply a option.
Advancements are new pieces of technology that have a greater net benefit than cost relationship.

I agree there.


1. a member or adherent of a political party seeking to represent the interests of ordinary people.
Isn't it being a majority that makes people "ordinary" ? Like, you cannot be a minority and be "ordinary" because it defies logic. Ordinary is defined by the majority holding that particular position. If it was a minority it would no longer be "ordinary"
So, conforming to the viewpoints of the majority (which are therefore logically "ordinary") would be in line with the definition. I of course respect your views, so im all ears, but I dont think I've interpreted it incorrectly?
@_date: 2016-12-05 03:06:32


Looks like a good read, and very brief too. Though we were not discussing democracy, but populism. So that's a rather far ranging tangent. And while populism is typically inherent within representative democracies, it is not strictly a artifcat of democracies.


The definition of populism seems to disagree with your statement. Perhaps you meant to say that populists rarely do whats in the best interests for the people, which would again be more of my previously used term "pseudo-populist", which there is no limit of examples. But we shouldn't mix those two up, there *really are* examples of virtuous politicians who fought for the people. MLK is probably the best example that comes to mind. We can go back and forth on bernie all day long, but the truth is he *has* fought for the best interest of the people, and he *has not* taken money from lobbyists and special interest groups and takes pride in the fact that he is one of the poorest politicans in washington. If you dont play their game, you may not be effective, but at least you can walk away with clean hands and a clean consciousness. As I think bernie has. So in that, i think he's a good modern example.
From wikipedia -




I was not referencing a system, but people. There absolutely are politicans who have *mostly* stayed close to a populist agenda, in that they fought for the people and peoples rights and pitted themselves against oligarchs, plutocrats and the like. I understand there is not going to be a overbrimming bowl of examples to choose from, but im hoping that we can agree that these people exist and that they did have the peoples best intentions at their hearts in both thought and action. There are many progressive leaders who fought for the people over the past few centuries.


Oh I agree. But things get murky in the 21st century. We have bigger worries now with laisse faire capitalists running government policy, who are then corrupted by industry, who then do horrible things in the name of short term profits to a mostly uneducated nation who realizes way too late the long term consequences. 
But basic capitalism I can agree without contraversy. We must all trade, we must all have rights to ownership. Without such basic features we cannot have a free and civilized society.

Now ask yourself, is "completely common opinions" a virtue? The obvious answer is no. Incase you need help, here is the definition of Virtue -


Now that you know what the term means, we can go from there hopefully. The key word here is "morality". Its required for "virtue". You cannot be both immoral and virtuous. 


Yet, there's no virtue being signaled here. Blockstream is not a virtue. Praising blockstream is not a virtue.  


You are disagreeing with the definition? Forget SJW's....your focus on SJW only shows your complete lack of control over your monkey brain. We are not discussing SJW's and SJW's have nothing to do with this conversation. 




Laughably, you stated....


While you yourself are guilty of cherry picking and not reading the entire phrase. Funny how you left the full sentence out, which reads...


When you have to cherry pick something to fit your narrative, you should immediately know that you are in the wrong.


No, you've expressed yourself clearly. You've done so by doubling down on your stance which as I have demonstrated above, is flawed and lacking proper education on the terminology and definitions.
Just accept that you used the term wrong, and seek to correct the usage so that you do not accuse others of things you do not understand in the future.
Praising someone for their work **is not virtue signaling**. Your mangling of this term is not cool, because *I actually like this term* and use it often, except appropriately.
Please dont fuck this term up. Its a good term. We dont need people misconstruing situations and using improper terminology confusing the public.

Let that sink in. *Less than 1 percent* of the variance is explained by the *correlations* discussed in the research. Correlation is not causation.
When you are using correlation as "evidence" then there must be some really extensive *statistical significance* to these correlations. Meaning, it needs to be far outside the "normal" range of chaos/noise in the ecosystem.
This paper has not even come close to demonstrating that the correlations/variances are statistically significant. 
Now, with that said...I would be willing to bet my life savings that there is corruption happening on the inside of *most* exchanges. A lot of bitcoiners here are free market extremists and think that these markets should not be regulated, that somehow there is some divine market force that will erase all of the collusion and corruption happening on the inside of these exchanges that results in losses to the standard unsophisticated investor. They will talk of morality and how that person shouldn't be playing the game, or he deserves it or whatever bullshit they spew.
But the truth is that we are fighting forces from *every side*. There is excessive corruption from the traditional financial incumbents (Libor, HSBC, etc), there is undoubtably corruption in the inside of these unregulated exchanges, there is undoubtably corruption/collusion happening with centric mining forces/conglomorations, etc.
None of it is pretty. But none of it can be resolved by pretending it doesnt exist. There exists valid rational reasons for regulation and transparency in marketplaces.
Bitfinex cannot print tethers if its books are open to *several* 3rd party auditors, including those handpicked by government agencies. It is unlikely that tether influenced the market more than 1 percent. I doubt it was even close to that. 1 point is actually quite a lot of money in this market, but not enough money to do long term damage, just enough to perhaps sway some short term swings if the emotions are right.
They should be held to a higher standard. They should be audited, and the tether printing process should be transparent. By allowing centric forces to control supply of fiat tokens for hedging, they gain enormous power in the ecosystem.
The entire point of bitcoin is to disintermediate these centric forces. How ironic is it that we allow these same centric forces to corner the market and absorb large swaths of powers capable of influencing price and supply?
As helpful as tethers are to the fluidity of trading, they are a poison in the ecosystem in their current state.

@_date: 2017-08-30 17:15:08


I disagree and think you are not forward looking enough. The entire point of a established LN is that you can do 10, 100, or 1000 txs before needing to settle. This reduces on chain load by 9, 99, or 999 txs per use case.
For those who wish to buy coffee and have no need for a perm stored forever ultra secure transaction you can utilize this caching layer. For services that need timestamping or proof of existence services, it makes sense to pay the fee to have that forever recording.
The bigger picture is that you pay a one time fee (seriously, 10 sat/byte txs are confirming right now, is that really so much?) to have a cache micropayment wallet that you can send plausibly thousands of transactions on with only needing one settlement tx. The math is easy.
The network effect of this will be enormous over time. It will reduce load on the main chain paving a way for those who *really need* it.
Forget your ideology and use rational thinking skills. We need a Bitcoin that is anti fragile so that we can have *both* use cases. You can have your coffee and a settlement layer both. If you just want quick easy onchain there are thousands of alts you can use. I don't care what some guy on Reddit promised you 3 years ago.

You seem to think that only pools exist. Miners are individuals who will mine whatever chain they want. When/if their pool does not support it, they will abandon them and form new pools.

Tldr - ETH is the reason BTC recovered from the 2014-2015 bear market.
First, I'm not so sure I agree with that. BTC and ETH are still coupled assets that follow each other without too much deviation. Second, this guy says that at first everyone didn't think ETH was going to work out and then it did blah blah. Frankly, it felt like the opposite. It was hyped as bitcoin 2.0 , Nick szabo being a big proponent, and then DAO happened and eth pooped all over the place.
I do agree that there was positive sentiment around eth that encouraged outsiders to look at more use cases for cryptocurrencies, and that might have had a noticable impact upon perception, and definitely more institutional support.
But was that what turned the price around? I do not think so. Nor do I think that is what's needed now. Nothing but time and allowing markets to play out will change things. I suspected a long protracted bear market after this bubble, but I still feel confident it will be shorter than the last time as there is much more infrastructure and momentum compared to 2014.
Also, it's clear that these price movements are predicated by whales. There just happens to be one super huge red candle that drops the price $100 every hour during these episodes? That's not organic, that's playing the market. Someone with a lot of Bitcoin putting a lot of pressure downwards attempting to manipulate the emotions of weak hands into selling, capitalizing on lower prices for buy backs.
It will eventually bottom out, and turn around after extended sideways movement. The bottom is probably 3-4k as that is what most miners costs are. Not saying we will get there...but it's definitely possible. If it does, sell supply will start to be reduced, price goes back up.

This is where I think you derailed.
Trump does *the exact opposite*. He belittles and attacks *the literal truth* and scapegoats these attacks through conspiracy theory mongering.
Instead of upholding the sancity of truth, he treats it like a flexible hose. That is not encouraging us to "question the validity" ...its doing the opposite. Its making people (who are simple) dig into basic untruths to rationalize positions harmful to society.
Its taking away peoples will for morality because why when you can just spin the truth, ignore facts, and cherry pick the truth?
The sad part is, I used to be just as angry about media conglomorations as the average Trumper *before* Trump. Long long before. 
But Trump is such a horrible person, that he has made this thing that has always been "fashionable" turn to shit. Now, I find myself standing up for these organizations because Trumps plays of power are not real, they are all decoys and feints, playing the media like a fiddle, creating chaos, confusion and divsion. If they are real, they are real because they enrichen him. So for the raw morality of what is supposed to be a prestine position of ethics, I have to reject his ploys.
Nothing could be more damaging to society than division politics. Something Trump *specializes* in.


Of course. But this is all politics. Its not something that actually takes effect in society. Its a game populsits play to fire up the people to vote for them. Trump has done nothing of his promises, and for some of that im glad. Some were horrible promises. 
But he is a liar at heart. He lies every day of his life. He's lied thousands of time *publicly and on the record*. He is obviously not beholden to truth and sees no reason to follow it.
For these reasons, he is a catastrophe and when you weigh the balance of positive and negative effects on society, this breaks the barrier to pieces on the negative, but barely moves the needle on positive.
Thats a horrible trade-off.

I agree there is no reason to oppose a 2MB increase, other than those who peddle fee market arguments, which are all matters of relevance and speculation.
I do not really see your evidence as solid. I think its a truthful statement. Bitcoin could not scale on chain, especially not during the period of time in which they made those statements.
To increase the blocksize would be to open bitcoin to massive attack vectors.
This is why SW is so important, because it fixes those attack vectors and allows for future tech that will enable on-chain scaling. So I do not see the dishonesty that you see, which means that your theory that BlockStream is crippling bitcoin for revenue falls apart. That evil intention that you think is there is just not there. Also, Cypherpunks dude. Thats who runs blockstream.
Anyone who seriously suggests to me that Cypherpunks are conspiring to create a megalithic capital conglomerate....well....you're fucking crazy, or you clearly don't know the history or these people.

[You know they are a open source project right]( ?
There is all the citations you could ever possibly want or need. The code has been looked at extensively by many cryptographers over the years. It uses in-browser crypto to generate keys and then to store your wallet as a encrypted container on their servers. At no point does the site store your keys because the keys are only used in a local in-browser session.
This is why there have been horror stories of people who created a new address, sent funds to it, then lost all those btc because their connection was shitty/lost so the browser didn't upload the new container with the freshly generated address/keys.
protonmail.com is a example of this technology, except for e-mail.
If you do not understand something, instead of being a snarky little shit, why dont you instead ask for clarification on the issue? Ignorance is fine so long as it is approached with a healthy dose of desire for learning, e.g. ask questions. But this type of response is just trolling with no pretense for wanting to learn. Dont be a troll. Be the guy who actually wants to educate himself and become a better person.

I wouldn't be so sure about that. We've seen plenty of "leverage" applied to multi-national corporations. So long as they serve US citizens, then the long arm of the US oligarchy will reach and crush these "enemies of the state".
But, looking at it from your perspective....you *really* want a non-US based company in charge of github? I would think the liklihood of economic espionage would increase by orders of magnitude depending upon where the holding company is geolocated.
I know that a lot of people here on this sub are indoctrinated with this laissez faire deregulated model, but I completely disagree with these models. There *are* valid functional purposes for regulation that serves society in positive constructs, this being one of them. We need to have scrutiny upon conglomorate entities that have access to such wide repositories of data that have economic consequences.
Look at facebook. Are we really going to argue that they should be deregulated? Or that if it wasnt a US company that it would be "better" ?
Im looking at it from all sides of the coin.

No correction is needed other than to emphasize that the other improvements are what enables the true Visa level scaling capabilities.
" if you build it they will come" holds true in most situations. The whole on chain scaling method does not account for the explosion that is going to occur once we allow microtransactions to exist on a global scale cheaply and efficiently.
When I think of this situation it reminds me of this really good book called "The Darkness That Comes Before". It's very dune like in that it becomes this psychological meta trance story where the mind can accomplish Feats previously unthought-of.
In the story a son takes a different path than his father and at some point meets his father and his father explains to him how the path that he chose was a dead end and he could not achieve his goal of total global control. It was the path that the son took that allowed him to achieve his goals because there were infinite possibilities. To me this is lightning Network verses on chain scaling

Thanks for taking the time to respond. I actually do see my failing now, thanks to you and others. It was a classic false dichotomy on my part. I was wrong to make that assumption and this could have quite likely just been a slight increase in usage combined with delayed blocks as a tipping point, which then drove users to bid up the fee rate to get confirmations.
Sound about right?
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:03:01


This right here proves you don't get it. No, it's not. No hardfork on a global decentralized system is "simple".
How are you going to coordinate your hardfork with 10's of thousands of node operators, businesses, developers and users across 30+ languages?
How are you going to ensure that a large portion does not partition themselves on a new fork?
The plan is both stupid and reckless. You cannot accomplish these things in a 3 month period without causing a major split.

How could he hide the transactions? Or cheat them?
I would like to think there is a way that we could be transparent about the transactions/invoicing so that it would make it much harder for the host to cheat. on-chain this would be easier, but through channels less so.
But im probably not thinking it through well enough. Or incapable.
But I do agree with you that the script flexibility on-chain on ETH does present clear advantages....with trade-off's of course.

If you create a barrier at a certain price point it creates a wall which reinforces prices beyond that barrier. Look up "spoofing" to understand this market mechanism. It's illegal to do on markets here in the USA but you see bots doing it commonly across all Bitcoin markets.
This same mechanism is being used by miners to keep fee pressure upwards. That's what the entire reveal was about with the recent study that showed 18 months of spam attacks. You could see in the plotting a clear linear line diagonally increasing price pressure over time.
Antpool has a economic incentive to keep fees high. This is one of many reasons they fought so hard against SegWit.

The burden to prove your theory is correct is up to you. It is not up to anyone else to disprove your idiotic theory. Disproving your theory is actually quite trivial, and would take about 10 seconds looking at transaction history over the past 3 days. Thats how elementary your *theory* is.

Great, we are getting somewhere now.....


You know what's a common feature I've observed of people working in all these fields? The people spouting the most jargon and regurgitating things that they've read word for word generally aren't all that great. 
Your other fields are entirely irrelevant to the discussion except to highlight a important point. Someone who has studied a specific field should understand that there is right terminology and wrong terminology.
If someone on NBC news started referring to a "pandemic" as a "hurricane event for diseases" you would probably think "WTF is this guy talking about"?
Because when you have definitions that are vital to the comprehension of a specific thing, you dont go around calling these things by other names.
Since you are clearly ignorant here...lets help you...from the [bitcoin whitepaper]( -


Im so sorry that you are ignorant on this topic and you dont understand it, but instead of being a shitty little kid that insists everyone else should call it something more palatable, why dont you grow the fuck up and learn about it instead? This process is so vital to bitcoins existence that anyone who is involved in bitcoin should learn about it and its process. Not be coddled like they are 2 year olds sucking their moms tits.  We are adults here and I think most of us are capable of learning.
There's no other term for it. And this wasn't a ELI5 thread. This was a thread about a whalespeak podcast where *experts* are discussing *highly technical aspects of bitcoin*.....its not intended to be a newbie topic. Sorry I wont dumb it down for you.
So take your shitty little kid attitude elsewhere.
Also, I seriously doubt you work in that field. You dont seem to have the maturity or education on the basics of academia to have a doctorate, or even a major.
By "Work in" do you mean you are a janitor at the hospital?
Im going to go ahead and label you a troll now since you've admitted your are ignorant, yet think you are researched enough on the topic to try to tell others who have devoted large chunks of their lives to this subject how they should speak.

Im a little confused here, maybe you or someone else could help clarify. AFAIK, opendime works in that once you break the middle piece off the device physically, it reveals the private key.
So one you do this once, isn't it pointless to exchange hands again? Or is the speculation here that people are exchanging multiple times before its broken? I suppose you could verify balance, and thats where this makes sense as multiple exchange?
But if that is the case, then does it not remove plausible deniability because you cannot spend it unless you break it. And once you break it, you are not giving it to anyone else. So it doesn't make sense as plausible deniability because it is reasonably assumed the owner of the open dime that is broken is the one who spent the funds using the private key, as no one can reasonably expect the opendime to be exchanged post-breaking.

Do you mean some sort of federated system with selected signers making decisions?
Yes, it would suck :/
I think that a few of the segwit2x signatories will bail, and then it will snowball. And nothing is to stop a lot of these pools from secretly mining the legacy chain while just saying "we are turning our miners off until the drama blows over".
I would be surprised if its less than 30% of the hashpower on the legacy chain come the november split. And with 30% the network would still be reasonably safeguarded against a 51% attack. That would require more than 30% of current hashpower to collude and attack the legacy chain. That could not be done without everyone noticing exactly who's hashpower disappeared from mining segwit2x.
Whoever decides to attack the legacy chain will quickly get blacklisted by nodes, and the community, in general, would be up in arms against this behavior. Great way to ruin your reputation and loose all your pool hashrate. That would be much worse than pulling a ghash.io

By this pump you mean starting at 790's and getting to the 860's where we are at currently? If so yes, I agree, but I believe thats a little misleading because he was obviously referring to the near 4 month run-up of price from the 500 range to the 800 range.
That *was* a slow gradual buildup and *not* a pump.
The fact that it got to 800 organically means that it would be fair to predict the price to settle back in the 800 range after all the hype. But from my experience of watching the market these last 3 years, everytime there is a big jump, it typically tends to retain at least some small % of that jump when things settle.  So my prediction would be $830-850 after the dust settles, assuming this is the run up to another bull run, and not the actual bull run itself topping out at 860. If 860 is all we got, then I expect it to drop back to 780ish after settling, with sell pressure forcing it much lower before the buy back somewhere in that range.
These are of course complete guesses so do not take them as sound advice.

And in the next 2 months when miners are given proper time to upgrade the OS's on their servers for their production environment, and then signal readiness for SW, are you prepared to eat your socks?
This upgrade requires a lot more than just double clicking a setup file. The compiler needs to be updated with the OS for a lot of these major hashing farms, which will take a good amount of time.

So, you think being a VC is contributing to bitcoin? Thats not. Thats contributing to businesses who have hoped to make a buck off bitcoin. Thats not to say that those services might not be helpful towards bridging infrastructure, but that is absolutely *not* contributing to bitcoin directly.
And the last one is laughable, why did you even write that? A bet? Yea, you are grasping at straws big time.
Everything Sam Mow has done has been *for bitcoin itself*. Every penny spent was a penny spent towards actual bitcoin infrastructure. And we are talking 100's of millions of pennys.
Beyond investing personal funds in actual infrastructure development of bitcoin directly, he has organized developer consensus meetings and got developers and miners together to work through scaling issues. Which is the exact opposite of Roger, who has spent his personal time attacking the developers who have worked the hardest to bring solutions to the most difficult of problems. Where Sam mow has tried to bring together, Ver has tried to divide. Which one is healither for the ecosystem? I fully expect another lunatic ramble filled with conspiracy theories in response to that btw. 
The basic difference there is stark and apparent, and its really sad that you cant see the obvious.
The only thing I could come up with Ver contributing towards bitcoin was him paying radio ad's between 2011-2014 that promoted bitcoin. 
I see all the other shit he's done and it makes me wonder how awesome bitcoin would be, and how much more it could be worth if he had just funded development directly instead of shitting it in the wind.

Just spent 30 min on mobile doing a analysis and accidentally hit the back button. FML.
TDLR.....Fucking awesome. Uses stealth addresses with confidential transactions to hide both input ownership and amount associations from output analysis without needing to wait for a on chain TX, hiding said info from both blockchain analysis and protocol participants.
Receiver also does not need to be a participant ...You can send using the protocol without them participating and they receive with all the privacy guarantees. Supposedly ddos resistant, but need to know what "four communication rounds" means specifically.
Still needs network layer anonimizing techniques to hide IP based identities, but I imagine extra layer mixing services will come to the rescue, assuming some crypto guarantees like tumblebit CE to play that offer trustless server based mixing services, e.g. super Saiyan God mode stuffs.
Bottom line.......The future is very very bright with all that is coming down the pipeline.

The obvious problem is that of false priorities. The main purpose of a node is enforcing consensus rules. If you don't understand this simple premise, then what else might you not understand? Decentralized systems are complex and require a bird's eye view from the top of the system understanding all aspects of the system to comprehend how it works as a system.
Government is a great example. Despite all my knowledge, it was not until or near 30 years old that I began to grasp the entire system as a system instead of incomprehensible pieces.
 If you don't see ALL of it, then you cannot possibly expect to understand it. This appears to be a weak point for Ver, who has demonstrated he does not understand the system. He is however, a populist, and populists do not need to be knowledgeable or factual in their ideologies, just capable of speaking to the lowest common denominator and using fear and paranoia as fuel for their misguided agendas.

BitTorrent has enormous value to society solely because of its decentralized nature. Without it, it would be worthless because it would be non existent like Napster. You could say the same for bitcoin.
I think both adoption and decentralization combined equal a much far greater value than something centralized and adopted. Once you realize this then you cannot try and argue decentralization does not bring value. On its own, it is not especially valuable, but bootstrapped decentralized anything is very valuable.
The difference is that something bootstrapped and centralized is more likely to be valuable to the owners, where decentralized and bootstrapped is more valuable to the public. The latter arguably of greater value to society.

I get its hard for people who have not invested a lot of time into bitcoin to understand......*but*.....
Satoshi was wrong, about several things. Never treat his words like gospel. You need to judge things by their own individual merit.
Satoshi also said we should have one huge wan facing node connected to thousands of lan facing nodes, to distribute the load. He was dead wrong on that. Thats not decentralization, thats not censorship resistant.
He was wrong there, and his statement taken out of context (like you did) would be wrong here. You cannot make the change he suggested without fixing underlying issues. Satoshi understood this, but you are not going to go find the quotes that elaborates on this. You are just going to cherry pick quotes that align with your narrative.


SW enables linear sigops, which prevents cpu ddos attacks, something that had to be fixed before any on-chain scaling could occur. All these big blockers have been ignoring that detail. 
As for introducing attack vectors, care to name them? There are going to be costs and benefits to every decision in life. The question is, are the benefits worth the cost? The engineers have long ago reached consensus the benefits massively outweigh the costs. 


So you think the will of the majority should be forced on the will of a minority? Is bitcoin ran by dictators now?  Also, this creates new attack vectors. Recall how I said above you must weigh the costs against benefits?
The benefit of this method does not guarantee a low cost. Infact, a simple application of game theory provides a scenario in which this would cause pure havoc  -


This does not guarantee a "safe" fork at all, and as you can see above it creates a scenario in which the minority has a economic opportunity.
Which, ironically, is exactly what the ETH scenario was. Which the article says it would fix. Yet does not.

There is no chilling at all in a pump. From 790 all the way into the 900's you see there is no middle ground. Its all vertical. There was plenty of horizontal action in the 790 range prior to the run up. Just because you dont want to see that doesn't mean it didn't happen.


Charts. Which by the way tell me a high of 777 on december 1st. As in, 22 days before this pump. But totally not anywhere near 790 riiiiite?

Almost no one uses bitcon for black friday. We are talking 0.000000001% of blackfriday purchases. Its a irrelevant metric to try to use to explain what is quite obviously a network attack.
There's nothing to explain a huge jump in sudden usage other than  many historical examples of network attacks. Only the pre 2013 run up did we see such volume spikes, and there is no indication that the same is occuring now. If it was, you would see the price moving, which it is obviously not.
I dont believe in conspiracy theories. I believe in events in which there are often irrational or rational actors. Since we have a demonstrated history of this occurring many times before, your theory as to who is doing it is irrelevant and does not take away from the fact that it is occurring.
Occam's Razor in this situation would mean that it is the same thing that's occurred a half a dozen times in the past two years -

Excuse me? Go ahead and read my post history. Do you see me running around attacking him? No, so how about you dont make assumptions and unfounded accusations. But I will absolutely point out his delusional statements when he does it. 


Nice false dichotomy. Go ahead and re-read what I said, and show me where it was that I said I was upset at him "for quitting". Go ahead...do it. You'll quickly find out that you are taking my statements entirely out of context and that I said no such thing. Im not upset at him for anything. Im *calling him out* for his delusional statements.
"Splitting hairs with the truth" does even begin to explain the statements in this blog post.
There's a difference, and you should recognize it. But not really expecting you to, since both you and him are clearly engaging in false dichotomies.  Try to examine the middle ground and overall picture better. You are being very one sided.
His over emotional self-victimization is entirely inappropriate considering that peoples lives and life savings were destroyed in this bitfinex catastrophe. He didn't have to quit and write an over emotional blog post playing the victim. He knew what was in store for him.
There were *real* victims here. Zack was not one of them. Him trying to portray himself as one is fucking laughable.

Paging and ....you guys were both persistent in your pointing out of data to me when I brought this topic up 2 days ago.
Do you guys have any thoughts on the data presented here?
@_date: 2016-12-04 19:46:01


In the end, bitcoin is dominated by economic interests. That is inclusive to both defensive and offensive mechanisms. We've seen both forms extensively.
Considering this, and considering that in order for bitcoin to remain fundamentally stable it must rely upon economic interests and remain insulated from social influence....
Doesn't attacking a malicious actor who is hurting others economic interest fall in line with that theory? If there is only one pool, a super minority who is blocking the forward progress of the network, which could very easily be argued as a single pool preventing the economic development, and thereby directly harming bitcoins market value, can't we speculate with morality removed (which is necessary for bitcoin to exist) that they are merely acting on their economic interests?
Im just trying to play devil's advocate here, because I think its important to recognize that if bitcoin is not resistant, if it is fragile to social attacks, then bitcoin cannot last. So maybe we need to do away with this pretense of morality and altruism and accept that there are instead actors who are pushing for the best economic interest of the network, and actors who are pushing against the economic interest. What their belief systems are is irrelevant, in the end all that matters is the path forward.
The network does not need to be perfect, it just needs to be good enough. But the network *can never be good enough if the network is divided instead of united*.
I would rather see an imperfect bitcoin with a majority steering than a philosophically perfect bitcoin being stalled by minorities ideologies.

Wow. After all the drama played out with Craig Wright, you seriously think it was a bad idea to not give Gavin the benefit of the doubt?
Time has showed us that core made the right decision with Gavin. If Gavin was correct with his vision, he would have been able to sway everyone. Thats how good vision works. But it wasn't good vision. The merits of his idea's did not hold water.
Gavin has unfortunately, made poor decisions. I say this with sorrow, because I really like Gavin. Dude is a incredibly nice guy. Very calm, very intelligent, but definitely prone to bad judgement.
Hindsight is 100%, and we can look back now and clearly see that Craig Wright was a charlatan. Nothing he said he would do did he ever do. Nothing.
Yet good journalism has shown us several million reasons why he had an economic incentive to scam people into thinking he is satoshi. The guy is a con artist. This has been proven, its not speculation. He conned the AUS government out of what, 35 million?

Pointing out incompetence is a feature not a bug. There's a reason for review in a open source model. What happens when the lead Dev makes blantantly rookie mistakes and does not have devs more capable than himself to find the mistakes?
This is what happened with BU. We all know where that lead it. Are we supposed to close our eyes and pretend otherwise and just pray everything will be alright?
We must resist takeovers by incompetent actors with our dying breath. To do otherwise would be to embrace central control which is to accept the destruction of Bitcoin.
ETH will be a corporate coin no matter how decentralized mining is because they have made themselves legal targets by centralizing development and creating eth foundation corporations. Not to mention the fork debacle.
To argue that is the best path for Bitcoin is literal insanity.

@_date: 2016-11-30 20:05:19
I think it goes both ways. There is definitely a little ego at play here. The bigger picture is *safely* scaling in a *responsible* way that does not jeopardize the most valuable aspect of bitcoin, its decentralization. Talking about "0.3mb" does not encapsulate all of that, so its a false dichotomy. 
And we are well on the way to doing that with SW now pending activation.
So lets look at what has been accomplished - Payment Channels/Lightning network, Malleability Fixes, Linear scaling of sighash operations (ddos protection), increased P2SH security, Script Versioning, Reduction of UTXO growth.....
Now, with all the fixes in place, can we not agree that the extra block space that SW provides will not last very long? I dont think admitting that is very controversial. Once we admit that, then we can start talking about possibly planning a safe HF to increase capacity. Im thinking maybe 1 year, maximum 1.5 years before blocks are full again. Possibly a lot sooner if all the use cases we think will open up with LN will occur. These channels must still be opened on the main chain.
So why not put *discussion* of a possible HF as we get closer to a projected time table, to appease those crazy people who assume that it will never happen? It does not hurt anything or anyone, its not really political because it actually *does need to happen at some point* ....and developers have not tried to hide this fact.
But they have specifically avoided discussing concrete timetables, and thats where I think there is a little ego at play. 
We all know what happens when you let ignorance with a cultish fervor spread across large groups......you get a President of the USA who thinks climate change is a chinese hoax. So how about we start approaching this with not only a careful consideration to the longevity of the network from a technical perspective, but also acknowledging the dangers of a social perspective? Or, once we do that...do we just get into the whole "At that point bitcoin has failed" discussion? And if that is the case, then I've been wondering .....if greg maxwell feels so strongly about this issue of the philosophy that bitcoins economics/consensus system need to determine its survival vs social/political pressure steering bitcoin .....then why does spend so much time on fighting the spreading of misinformation?
Wouldn't it make more sense to attack the issue from a authoritative position? Wouldn't having core admit a near-future HF is a reality do much much more to stop the spread of misinformation than to individually respond to posts on reddit?
Thoughts appreciated.

How so? Signaling for SW just began. There's been no way to block something that has not even started being measured.


It was never about the currency, it was about timestamps, token trading and verifiable consensus. But I agree this is no big deal for bitcoin.


BU obviously. There's only one minority and we all know who it is. Just like there is only one faction attempting to stall. The other side has been hard at work writing literally near a million lines of code to upgrade the network. The other side? Preaching pseudo-economics and pseudo-free-market ideology. Kind of like Corporate banks.

This type of economic activity happens very slowly over time. It does not happen in a rush. These new users you speak of are doing exactly as you described, purchasing as investment and not as digital cash to be utilized.
Which means there's plenty of time for scaling. Which is good because we need it with all the political posturing going on.
Either way, both scenario's support a healthy vision and lack the urgency that is often peddled by doomsayers.

This is how delusional you are. You think the upgrade that bitcoin is about to see is "suffering" ?
Or do you mean the extra 5 cents per transaction. Is that your idea of "suffering" ?
Im more than happy to see a *very* short term sacrifice on fee pricing if that means the implementation of a layer 2 network that will enable bitcoin to scale so that it *can* take everyone's "coffee" purchases, and micro transactions and whatever other case use that has not been found yet, *at incredibly cheap prices*.
Seriously, its nothing but wins all around. Everyone gets what everyone wants....except for a few immature children who are stomping their feet and throwing tantrums over things they clearly do not understand. 
It never ceases to amaze me the stupidity of those attempting to stall progress *that will give them what they want times infinity*.

No one said anything about guarantee's and I've extensively tried to highlight the fact that im aware the movement is taken advantage of for selfish reasons. But that does not make the movement selfish, it makes the actor selfish. Its not a generous definition, its exactly what its intended to be. We can agree that rarely is it executed in its defined form.
School systems have nothing to do with the political ideology of populism. 


It makes sense when you think it through. The only way you can change systems is either on the inside or through overthrowing it. He was an example of an insider attempting to change things towards his ideologies. You cannot possibly disagree on the fact that Greenspan helped implement free market ideological policies. Again you are trying to be a purist here ignoring the middle ground. Dont engage in false dichotomies ;) Greenspan was a laisse-faire capitalist, and it doesn't matter your opinion on the subject, he attempted to implement these ideologies within our system. Regardless of the fact that the system itself could never truely allow a fundamental pure laissz-faire system, he helped steer it in that direction. To say otherwise is to ignore the decades of policies which he advocated for.
If you want to make your point, then you can go through literally decades of his free market ideologies and policies enacted around this, and try to explain why they are not what they clearly are, but I think thats a waste of your and my time because clearly Greenspan was all about the free market. This is a pinnacle of laizze-faire capitalism and your assertion that everything must exist in its pure form to be considered that thing is absolutely ridiculous and entirely out of touch with reality. There is no such thing as pure systems so quit it with all of the ridiculousness.


Right. And he did his best to deregulate. Again, a example of changing from the inside. You are assuming that one has to be a purist to implement a ideology. Thats simply untrue. Stop trying to assume everything in the world is black and white. Its not. 


Huh? Now you are just being childish. I never said that, YOU did. Dont put words in my mouth, think and say your own thoughts, dont try to act like you own my mouth or you can change reality to fit your perspective. 
Which bring us to this point...


And? I agree with you. Populism attacks not only the political incumbents within the direct governemnt, but also political incumbents that reign power over the monetary system. This should go without saying so im unsure the point you are trying to make here.  The discussion was about POWER. Thats what populism is about, attacking those with power who have used that power for corrupt ways. It does not have to just be about senators and congressional seats. It obviously has to do with the Federal Reserve as well. You are again splitting hairs. The FED has enormous power over the everyday lives of people and it is 100% within alignment of the populist movement to attack those who are institutionally corrupt.

We've already argued about coffee purchases on bitcoins ultra secure layer for years now and nothing has changed, it's still dumb. We do not need to store censorship-proof transactions of coffee on the bitcoin blockchain.
This is exactly why LN has been created. So that you and the other billions of people can purchase their day to day crap that doesn't need to be recorded permanently forever on a public ledger.
If you really want fee's to go down, why dont you have a chat with Antpool [since they got caught red handed in activity related to spamming the blockchain]( ?

This is a form of what he suggested, though much more fancy and with a lot of checks and balances introduced.
This model introduces CoSi (a collective signing protocol) that allows miners to form signing-groups to aggregate signatures to achieve almost instantaneous block confirmations achieved by combining CoSi with merkle tree's.

I always see the big blockers come out in force to ~~cry~~ complain that bitcoin is going to crash and burn because of the blocksize due to network congestion during the next rally.
Well folks, we are going through the next rally. We've been living it for the last 8 days. Yet throughout those 8 days there has been no network delays at all. And There has actually been a huge decrease of mempool transactions over the past 8 days! I've been monitoring my nodes daily expecting trouble and there has been no trouble to find.
This all makes me wonder.....
Has there ever really been "organic growth" that has lead to confirmation delays? Because we are living that organic growth right now and not only is the mempool *not* growing, its **shrinking** as the price goes higher!
Looking at the metrics, the way the network is running, fee rates, mempool sizes...it appears that bitcoin is not only doing fine under these constrained conditions....its doing **great**!
It makes me think that the holidays are a time where people are spending quality time with their families instead of devising network attacks to constrain bitcoin to further a political agenda. Because if there was a time to attack bitcoin to achieve a goal, right now would be the time. But there's a problem with that....those same people who want to attack bitcoin are watching their bitcoin investment grow right now. They are making money on their investments and it would be a really stupid time economically to throw it all away.
Looks like bitcoin is working **Exactly as intended**.

I dont really like the term because its misused so often anyways. People called bernie sanders a populist, it was his most common label other than "socialist". Just because someone's popular doesn't make him a populist. A populist has to pander to popular consensus of the average man.
Bernie's message has been consistent for 20 years. He wasnt popular for 19.5 of those years, so kinda hard to categorize him that way. Strange as it may seam, its hilary who could be most closely defined as a populist. She "evolves" as popular opinion on subject matter becomes clear to her.

Completely agree, its a end result, a reaction to corruption. But one should not group the corruption of democracy and populism in the same boat, because populism is the attempt to attack the corruption. Yes, its used in a pseudo-populist fashion often as a way to achieve power, but again better to not lump those together as they are different things.  


I did in the last msg, but here you go -




Re-read my comment for illumination. I specifically said "now with laisse faire capitalists running government policy" ....which means that people like Alan Greenspan take Laissez-Faire Capitalism approaches and apply it to monetary policy. One could argue the FED's monetary policy is not government policy, but I think we are splitting hairs at this point.


Definitely not confusing anything ;) There is no such thing as a true free market, so the point is moot, though I do agree with the statement.

So, just to be clear, you are not supportive of MS's decentralized identity system? Just because it's MS?
No company is inherently evil. Corps will do things that have both positive and negative effects on society. You are thinking in blacks and whites and it solves nothing being so simple minded.
I don't care if MS owns GitHub, it will have *literal zero effect* upon the open source community. 
Your fear mongering is the problem here. You have not stated any rationales behind your fear other than generic conspiracy theory BS. Stop generalizing and start stating specifics if you want people to take you seriously.
Yes, Google and MS have the power to be abusive. But they also innovate in ways that make society better. Look at all the good work the gates foundation does for the world. These are positive macro effects as a result of MS being powerful. Not to mention the advancement of technological society.

Undoubtedly this is true, but what is not true is the 10's of thousands of new people being "fake". And literally millions of coinbase users.
A few hundred shill accounts takes a *lot* of manpower to manage. Ultimately people are behind these shill accounts so they are still limited by human barriers, friction, time, labor etc.
It would take a nation state to state to employ the amount of people needed to manage shill accounts in the thousands. Look at the research about ruddian troll factories. Even they struggled with 10k accounts.

Even more reasons that the fee market should be robust and developed. Anything that prevents malfeasance in mining behavior is a net positive for the network. 
If the transaction fee's were high enough, it would make economic sense to not mine this way and to instead grab the reward. Fortunately there is an equilibrium at play here, because the more empty blocks mined the higher the mempool the more competitive the fee market gets and eventually it doesn't make sense to mine empty blocks.

Good point, but its against the spirit of this article, which is to speed up propagation of this enhancement to various 3rd party developers codebase, so that more and more users can enjoy the upgrade. Those users who use those services will not get cheaper/better transactions until their provider upgrades or until they switch.
The more people that use SW styled wallets, the healthier the network is, the lower the blockspace used, etc. So there are plenty of valid reasons to echo this message and encourage others using it.
Its a good intention, and I like that. Its got the ring of truth to it, even if a few minor details are off.

I think you are taking your opinion over the definition here. Populism by definition is the opposite of corruption, its the battle against corruption within the corrupt system. Tyranny of the majority is often a democratic scenario...e.g. mob rules, and while it may be an artifact of populism, it is not something inherent to populism. Populism is simply an ethical approach to politics to defeat corruption by acknowledging the corruption.


I disagree and I believe you are splitting hairs. I agree on your statement in theory, but we live in reality not theory. In reality, Greenspan was as laissez-faire as one could get within a government institution. He had a fundamental free-market deregulatory approach and much of the following decades was built upon this approach. I get it, the institution itself shouldn't exist in a *pure* laissez-faire system, but I never said that the USA was a pure laissez-faire system, only that someone who believe in laissez-faire capitalism *influenced* government policies. I believe that to be a very truthful statement and the actions of his time, the policies enacted by his hand, are proof of this. I feel like you are a maximalist in this discussion where the reality is that things are always blended with grey area's. There is no pure system of anything.


I did. I specifically talked about free market/deregulation principals, which were expressed by Greenspan and influenced government policy. I stand by that statement. No, it absolutely had nothing to do with crony capitalism. This was an ideological driven discussion in which Greenspans economic theory impacted monetary policy....it had nothing to do with morals or ethics.

In healthier liberal democracies with higher voter turnout, there exists better structured regulatory framework to serve the public.

Your behavior is apathetic and works *against* democracy. You are welcome to your negative viewpoints, but please don't accuse others of being naive when its really just your lack of depth in understanding modern socioeconomics.
The way I would look at this situation is like the private conglomorate banks in the USA vs Credit Unions. The CU's are extremely beneficial to society and don't seem to engage in the parasitic behaviors we see spread amongst the larger institutions.

You are kidding yourself if you think bch is a decentralized network. The reason we judge it so harshly is because it's prominent figures are the centralized heads in which the network runs off of. BCH would not exist except for bitmain, it's subsidiaries and the slimey likes of Ver.  These are the same people openly lying to the public, purposefully misconstruing the truth to take advantage of less educated investors.
Essentially, it's a centralized scam coin. So yes, we absolutely can judge this pseudo-bitcoin by it's main proponents.
Edit - And isn't that what they did for years? Wasn't bch born on the back of a conspiracy theory, that big evil blockstream has "taken over" Bitcoin so bch is here to save the day, to "Satoshi's true vision"? The hypocrisy here tastes so sweet.

It was predicted by other developers long before that. We always knew the blocks would get full at some point, the question was *how* to safely and effectively scale. Since the issue was not simple, there was no consensus.
Fortunately, very intelligent engineers came up with a solution. It took me a year to realize how good a solution it was. I used to be a vocal gavin and garzik supporter.

They dont support free speech, yet are contributors to a open source project? Isn't a open source project the pure definition of free speech?
They are saying "Anyone can be a part of this, everyones voice will be heard". Now, that doesn't mean that your voice will be eloquent enough to sway people, and free speech has nothing to do with such semantics. Its about fundamental rights to be able to speak.
Just like the fundamental right of your speech is empowered by your ability to anonymously submit code to the project, and have that code be peer reviewed for its merit, and determined to be submitted or not submitted by a very large distributed group of academics/engineers.
I can think of few things as empowering as that, and few things that could be said to be more supportive of free speech than that.
I think Roger Ver is confusing not wanting to get mixed up in complex social issues (professionalism?) with suppression of free speech.
For example, if you were a black dude at a KKK rally, you *could* try to go and mediate with the leaders and explain your side. Or, you could recognize the dangers of doing such a thing, getting involved in a complex situation with pitchforkers all around you who may plausibly do you harm.
Can anyone really blame the black guy for not wanting to step up to the plate?
Core does what core needs to do - write code. They are not a social media organization. They are not a PR firm. They are engineers so they must engineer.
The merit of their engineering will be determined by the nakamoto consensus mechanism and that is *all that matters*.

Even just the fact that this company is mining bcash is bad. It does not matter what they do with the tokens once mined, as they have already added security to the network.
Why they would bother is beyond me.....


What was the launch cost of a S9? I know they were around 2k before halong released dragonmint. Im just trying to find out what the cost of this much equipment was.
At 2k it comes out to 15.7M in cost. They made pretty close to 1M in may @ 122 btc @ a basis of 7600. They did better in may than they did in april, so we can assume around 900k for april. I think its reasonable to expect at least another doubling of hashpower if not tripling before year end, which means that @ 1M per month, by the end of the year their revenue will be near 300k.
So basically, they might recoup 20% ish of their overhead cost in 2018? Considering the pace of mining technology and the ever increasing difficulty, the only way I could see such a mining operation be profitable is if we hit another ATH in the next year.
Risky business.

Mining centralization will always be a threat to the ecosystem. Centralization of any kind is a threat to bitcoins decentralized model. If CHINA BAN BITCOIN for the nth time, and it was "for real for real" this time, then it would be the best thing that could happen to bitcoin. Yes, it would hurt like a bandaid being pulled off, but over time mining would spread in a more decentralized fashion around the world because thats the beauty of the diff algo adjusting to flucutations. This would be a massive boon to bitcoin.
Right now all of the centralized mining in bitcoin is a threat. Anything that eliminates centralization is a great thing for bitcoin.
Bitcoin doesn't need anything from nobody. It will do fine because of its built in incentive structure. If miner A stops, miner B picks up somewhere else.

That is the excuse Russia is using to it's citizens but not the truth. The truth is Russia is building an intranet similar to China so that they can control the flow of information in their society.
This is insanely bad for democracy and freedom in general as it creates even stronger and more dangerous nationalism. 
This is the kind of stuff that will lead to WW3. It's bad enough China is already this way and look at the insane shit going on there. Complete government control of society, massive propaganda. What happens when China and Russia start to fool their citizens together in coordinated propaganda about the rest of the world? War happens. And next time might lead to multinational nuclear warfare.

.....sure. 
Notice how you didn't find any damaging dumps? That's because their are none. Reposting public domain is not a leak nor a form of whistleblowing. It's damage control via PR.
If you wish to prove to me otherwise, feel free to find any dumps from WikiLeaks that are actual real whistleblowing....which is *the entire point of WikiLeaks*.
Until you do so you certian you won't be changing any minds. Remember, this is a organization about public transparency. The abscence of evidence yadda yadda doesn't apply because their entire existence is about public dumps.
That means if you can't find dumps vis their public facing entity, then those dumps don't exist.

From abstract...


sus process in permissionless blockchains such as Bitcoin. As forks can
be caused by numerous factors such as latency and miner behavior,
their analysis provides insights into these factors, which are otherwise
unknown. In this paper we provide an empirical analysis of the an-
nouncement and propagation of blocks that led to forks of the Bitcoin
blockchain. By analyzing the time differences in the publication of com-
peting blocks, we show that the block propagation delay between miners
can be of similar order as the block propagation delay of the average
Bitcoin peer. Furthermore, we show that the probability of a block to
become part of the main chain increases roughly linearly in the time
the block has been published before the competing block. Additionally,
we show that the observed frequency of short block intervals between
two consecutive blocks mined by the same miner after a fork is conspic-
uously large. While selfish mining can be a cause for this observation,
other causes are also possible. Finally, we show that not only the time dif-
ference of the publication of competing blocks but also their propagation
speeds vary greatly.


We provided an empirical analysis of the announcement and propagation of
Bitcoin blocks that caused blockchain forks. The large differences in the first
announcements of competing blocks indicate that the block propagation delay
between miners can be of similar order as the observed 50 % block propagation
percentile. The probability of a block to become part of the main chain increases
linearly in the headstart (i.e., the time the block has been published before the
competing block) between 100 ms and 10 s (from less than 70 % to more than
80 %). The observed frequency of block intervals between two consecutive blocks
mined by the same miner to be less than 100 seconds is conspicuously large.
While selfish mining can be a cause for this observation, other causes are also
A better understanding of the factors influencing the propagation speed of
specific blocks might be gained by an in-depth analysis of (orphaned) blocks and
client implementations. Furthermore, our analysis might profit from more data,
especially on recent forks. While the reduced frequency of forks is generally good
for the system, it is unfortunate for empirical research.

While I acknowledge this truth, I also dislike pandering to authorities like WikiLeaks. I used to be a huge fan of the organization until they were clearly utilized by Russia to engage in political warfare to disrupt the 2016 US elections. They were duped into being puppets in a disinformation war.
This is a great example as to why centralization is bad. Even an organization about transparency and truth was hijacked to sow chaos and discord.
This is not to say the organization has not done great things, it is just to recognize that central entities with wide enough reach can be utilized for bad as well. 
The 2016 was an example of cherry picking one specific side and putting it on blast. What I would have liked to see was *both* the RNC and DNC emails disclosed so that the public can get a fairly balanced view. Both are rotten to their cores so if you only show how rotten one side is, it creates a distorted perspective that causes harm to society.
It's also blatant how involved WikiLeaks is with Russia because they specifically have avoided data dumps on Russia and Russian entities. Isn't that a little suspect considering how they were just used by Russia? The point being....this is not a open and fair organization without bias, and it's clear they have corruption as well.
This will probably get a lot of hate here....but as I said I used to really like them but times have changed.
When this CSW claim was originally published there were many reputable cryptographers who debunked it and provided mathematical proof. Why must we rely on WikiLeaks to demonstrate what can be proven with math? Leave pandering to celebrities out of Bitcoin please and let's stick to math.

Textbook false dichotomy. This is not a either or situation. Bitcoin existed for 4 years before most of the world had ever heard of it. Even today it's not mainstream, yet the network is vibrant.
This is living evidence that your theory is wrong.
Bitcoin can exist without mainstream the same way that altcoins can exist without ever becoming "mainstream". There will always be niche markets.
The reason you have tailored your narrative this way is because you focus on price. This is exactly the wrong way to think about Bitcoin. It is a alternative financial system of sovereignty and ultimately price is irrelevant. The network will contract and expand depending upon usage. Big or small it will probably exist in some form for the rest of our lives.

Ehhhh. There's a gigantic assumption in his point that I just cannot stomach. The rest of it is well written, but the main point I just cannot see the rationality behind it.


The assumption is that raising the cap will result in centralization in mining so great that it will result in market manipulation.
So sorry, but a 8mb block can be propagated in 12 seconds (without consideration of burst) on my *home* connection, and I pay the lowest tier offering. I also live in US, where our connection speeds suck compared to the rest of the countries in the world that are suitable for mining (except china of course) Well, what else will force this mining monopoly? The total size of the block chain? Considering that we already sell 256GB SD cards/4TB HD's for only $99 bucks, I think its pretty safe to say that moore's law provides a solid argument for both cheap space and bandwidth at a residential level to support mining.

And this is why hal finny is legendary. He was the first cryptographer to [challenge this narrative]( as well as to espouse the requirement for 2nd layer networks. 


Why would Hal finney argue a 2nd layer is neccessary if not on the basic premise of preserving the security/decentralization of the first layer? I understand he doesn't come out and shout it, but the implication is obvious.
A theory does not make something reality. if you are asking for evidence that increased costs reduces participation that is definitely something that can be empirically demonstrated the question is whether or not you wish to challenge your intellect. Economic barriers to entry is a standard thought process when analyzing business models. the higher the economic costs the higher the barrier to entry and the reduction of participation.
This is not a theory. It's a reality that exists in all parts of nature. This is one of those I'm not going to bother explaining why water is wet scenarios and if you don't want to challenge yourself it's okay but I'm not interested in engaging on such base contrarian thought. You are welcome to show me research that increased barrier to entry does not reduce participation rates in the technology sector but you have to realize that it is you who is challenging a common-sense and well-established reality, so it will have to be you to provide evidence to the contrary.
As an example for understanding how ridiculous it is to challenge this widely held common-sense theory, ask yourself a few basic questions -
Why are there not higher participation rates in esquestrian sports? Why do africans not have a hockey league? Why does everyone not drive ferarri's? The obvious answer to all of these things are a barrier to entry due to limited resources. This applies to every single industry and network on the planet earth, and if I truly wanted to dig into it, im sure I could provide biological evidence that this happens on a mitochondrial scale as well in all organisms. 


It originated from a variety of cryptographers and security researchers who understand basic security design. This is pretty simple man. If you want to remain decentralized you must reduce barrier-to-entry which means reducing costs. It doesn't have to be a raspberry pi, but you do have to recognize that this is a global system that needs to exist in third world countries if it is to provide the benefit originally intended. Its a unfortunately common fallacy that people love to think inside the box that bitcoin only exists in rich 1st world countries where participants have large fiscal wealth, but the system is global and participation needs to be global to stay resiliant. Basic examples of these models are the tor/sphinx network, which if centralized becomes fragile. Bitcoin has the same properties.
The reason you are probably caught up in the fact that Satoshi speculated we could have server farms is because Satoshi also used Moore's law as a rationale. What you might not have thought of is that when Satoshi wrote that Moore's law was still in effect, or rather there was no conclusive data proving that Moore's law had actually slowed down by that point.
I don't know how many pages I've written on this topic but I went through my saved history and noticed that at least half if not more of my history is gone due to reddit's purging of time :( I guess I've been around so long that most of the shit I've written over the years has disappeared into The ether. that's not to say that it's not still there it's just that there's no easy way for me to find it anymore since at least half of my saved is now gone. I do recall however that Moore's law showed significant slowdown by 2010. Something that Satoshi might have not been able to empirically extrapolate into his thought process when writing in 2010.
But the point is simple. Satoshi made that server farm comment based on a faulty assumption. The assumption was that Moore's law would accelerate and that technology prices would continue to deaccelerate. This certainly might be true for some forms of technologies, but it is unfortunately not true for the most expensive part of Bitcoin which is RAM. 
What you will see a lot in discussions on this topic is uneducated folks asserting strawman, that hard drive cost has somewhat followed a Moore's law path. The hard drive cost as it relates to note operation is the least significant cost and is barely relevant to the conversation.
When analyzing barriers to entry and cost you don't cherry-pick one part of the technology you have to include the whole.
Satoshi was wrong on this point. That doesn't mean that his overall vision wasn't wrong just that he's a human being and can't possibly get every single detail correct. Either way I see no point in pandering to false gods, Bitcoin is a global system with hundreds of contributors and Satoshi is dead.
Science is about peer review. One person's opinion is irrelevant.


I'm not sure I agree but I also don't disagree. I don't know what the future of lightning Network looks like. you are correct in that there are trade-offs between centralization and scaling. Lightning network is a second layer and it doesn't need to be decentralized. That's the entire point of preserving the decentralization of the first layer.
Lightning can become centralized for all I care. I doubt it will but it doesn't bother me at all. There will always be competition in the space and alternate options.


I don't know about the first but I have seen how easy invoices have become and it's nearly at parity with bitcoin itself. You click an invoice button and you click pay....no one is expecting your grandparents to be able to use lightning and I don't really care about your grandparents using lightning because they will be dead soon.
I care whether 20 year olds will use it and the question is will 20 year olds today be able to understand how to pay a ln invoice network with two clicks? The obvious answer is yes. 
The future is bright don't get caught up in fallacies. This is a long-term technology. We don't need old people to use technology, we need to educate young people about liberty.
Edit - upon rereading I realize that I didn't explain the server farm /Moores law link very eloquently. Yes Satoshi did use Moore's law as a rationale. And he also speculated that we could farm out work to server farms. The two are intertwined because the term node meant Miner when Satoshi wrote that. He was essentially saying that mining farms would eventually replace the CPU miner at his home. Its also important to understand that these are two different arguments. I *think* (but can only speculate) that his position in 2010-2011 was *probably* "The network will scale with adoption due to moore's law, but that ultimately if it becomes too big we can farm the work out to servers". You can extrapolate this from [his commentary to gavin here]( as well as the other context of his public quotes, e.g. previously quoted server farm stuff.


I believe he knew this because he probably was running a mining farm himself and could speculate that others would do the same. I only bring up moore's law because this discussion is intertwined with this theory, and satoshi is on the record of it, and it involves scaling, etc. Good to provide context to fully grasp the situation.
This has always been a problem in Bitcoin. Mining centralization has its own pitfalls. Satoshi used the assumption that economic incentives would disallow for miners to work against the system.
Yet that is exactly what has happened in the switch/sw2x/bch drama. We have seen large mining organizations (bitmain) acts in direct opposition to the system that they were supposedly supporting.
Satoshi's game theory was weak in this regard. Even though he saw a future where all coins existed he clearly didn't see the power struggle that would occur over Bitcoin and how it would lead to a split where large centric forces would attempt to take over the system and then in a whiny rage quit hurt the system as much as possible to prop up a competitor (themselves via bch)when that coup attempt failed.
Also, satoshi does point out that increased costs will lead to less participation in the original quote -


This also demonstrates the diff terminology used in 2010. "client nodes" = nodes of today. "node" = miners. Just so we can have a frame of reference for what satoshi meant when he said it at that time.

So, a system which relies upon people to use their escrow in order to be commissioned suspended your account for bypassing their payment structure?
Seems totally fair to me. 
They may not state it explicitly in their ToS, but this is a common sense agenda. You are bypassing the system to prevent paying them commissions, for whatever justifications or reasons you have, and because of this they were robbed of how much $ over two years?
You should be happy you got 2 years of commission free trading instead of complaining about how your account got shut down for valid reasons.
Consider yourself fortunate they did not take your money. If it was me, and I found you bypassing my commission system for a site that costs money to run, I would have waited until you had a balance in your wallet and then deducted 2 years worth of commissions from you.

There's a difference between an untested system, and one that has 9 years of production environment real world data.
I would articulate that 9 years has proven that its highly unlikely that bitcoin *can* be attacked. It would be difficult to argue that right now the correct environment exists for such a possibility. Maybe in 2014 when ghash hit 51%...sure! But now or since then? 
If the developers of the system cannot even articulate the math behind it, then you should be highly critical of those developers. The response that it is "open source" is not a valid response. We are not IOTA developers. Nor are we cryptographers.
If they don't understand their own system well enough to explain to non-experts as to the 'why' then they have already failed in their duties of leaders of a project.

Sorry, I was making a joke. I didn't think you were being serious. I looked this up and couldn't find any good data showing that coconut oil helps regrow hair. I did find a study that demonstrated coconut oil was effective at preventing damage to hair follicles, which when used preemptively would *reduce* hair loss.
But I have strong doubts in regards to it acting as a hair growth agent. If that were the case, im pretty sure we would have a billion companies trying to sell coconut oil as magic hair elixer.

The entire point of bitcoin is operating in a trustless environment. If you wish to gamble on crypto then you must currently put your trust into that exchange.
Since trustlessness is baked into the protocol of bitcoin, it makes sense that the users of bitcoin should also have this concept baked into their philosophical stance, as well as their every day behaviors.
Whats the point of using state level censorship resistant money if you are so dumb that you cannot withdrawal your btc from the exchange 12 hours before the fork?
If you are that stupid, maybe you should be using paypal and skip the high tech crypto forever ledger eh? Bitcoin takes the responsibility of money out of the states hands, and puts it **into the citizens hands**. If citizens are going to irresponsibly use their money, *they should be punished for it*. The same way that if you leave your wallet open on the street, its gonna get jacked and you deserve it.
You cannot have it both ways. You cannot cry about state level monetary policy stealing your wealth, and also claim that you do not hold 100% responsibility for your btc. Its 100% your responsibility, and either you need to take that responsibility seriously, or you are going to *lose your money*. Thats the beauty of bitcoin, that it teaches people to be more fiscally responsible.

The average citizen does not "read the policy", though yes, I actually have viewed dozens of bills from the senate website that I was interested in. Im not a academic persuing a masters in PolySci though, so no, you wont catch me reading entire bills frequently. But you also definitely wont catch 99.999% of the population doing it either. 
Dude, our congressmen and women doesn't even read our own bills soo why dont you drop the strawman there buddy, because its not a effective rationale. You don't read the bills either. Just like if I asked you what the 8th constitutional amendment was, you wouldn't be able to just say it off the top of your head, like 99.99% of the population.
But you know what I do, which is much more than the average person?
[I actually read the analysis by the CBO]( and [listen to academics when they run the numbers](
The best part is you think I watch TV. I've not paid for a cable subscription in nearly 20 years now. No, I dont "watch CNN" bro.
But I do listen to people who actually know what the fuck they are talking about and weigh their advice and ignore the politicians who don't even read the bill they are advocating for, other than to allow the changes to be passed by-proxy from their industry lobbyists who fill everyones pockets with money.
This is a bi-partisian issue. Every side is corrupted and every side is doing fucked up things because they are bribed to do them.
Your problem is you seem to be only listening to the politicians and talking heads of your tribe, instead of listening to the academics who have *actually ran the numbers* and shown it to be massively short.
And yes, it does *exactly as I said it does*. You want to ignore cause and effect, do so by all means. But don't ask me to ignore cause and effect of policy driven decisions upon the economy. You want to just say "Derka derda der, the bill says that it does this, it doesn't mean that!" ...your not a expert dude. Neither am I. Which is why I listen to people who actually are academically educated on the topic talk about the tradeoff's. And you should too.

Because Bitcoin is a decentralized censorship resistant network. It cannot accomplish a reasonable defense if it exists in one legal domain. How easy would it be for a nation state to attack the network if they only have to issue a single warrant to eliminate 90% of the network?
Then ddosing the remaining 10% is trivial.
Bitcoins network security relies upon a distributed ad hoc network in as many regions as possible to prevent these attacks.
These B2X corporate clowns don't live in the reality that Bitcoin was designed for. They live eat and breathe about rules, laws and regulations. Bitcoin is designed to intermediate their state based threat model. They exist to try to wrestle control and market share. They are learning a hard lesson right now on the true nature of Bitcoin, and hopefully there are real world financial repercussions for their hostile actions. Would love to see these businesses fail, we will design around them regardless, it will just take time.

Your logic is broken and its quite a pita to untangle the madness in this one.
OK. So mempool is clogged because EDA is causing flucuating hashrate (essentially stealing btc's hashrate, lowering its security). The tradeoff of that "extra profitability" is a loss of security and restricted network performance.
And you counter with..... 


Do you see how stupid that is? You are literally arguing against yourself. You cannot argue that its "more profitable" and then criticize the fact that security is being lessened. You need to pick which one you prefer and stick with your story because you cannot have both.

Ok. I see what you mean and I didn't understand your first request, but thats no fault of your own, I didn't give it the consideration due as I usually do when I see "redditor of x days/months" trying to lead me into nonsense. It does seem a fair question however so I'll address it.
The empirical evidence is in technology aside from bitcoin. I cannot see, nor present the future, so its entirely pointless to try to empircally quantify the "folly" of big blocks (hint - bcash doesn't have them because no one uses bcash, so its impossible for me to provide said data).
But first we have to clarify what i meant by "folly" in order to address the issue. The "folly" as I mean't it, was that its impossible to have a decentralized network that has central properties. If you create top-down driven protocol/policy changes that introduces changes to the network that requires greater costs, then this will lead to centralization as there will be lower participation.
But hey, don't believe me, the creator of bitcoin [said this himself in 2010](


The point of bitcoin is to offer an alternative to the established authoritarian centralized system of control over fiscal policy. This means that in order for the system to work as intended, it needs to stay decentralized. That cannot happen if it becomes centralized.
The joke of this all is that bcash is one of the most highly centralized systems both from planning and from infastructure perspective. Bitmain and subsidaries control the majority of the hashrate, the development is sponsored by bitmain and bitmain subsidaries (which includes roger/bitcoin.com and its subsidaries), the majority of media/social interaction is in highly centralized places, most of the propaganda comes from bitmain and bitmain subsidaries, etc.
Before I waste my time explaining to the cow that grass is good to eat, you are not actually objecting to the fact that centralization causes centralization...are you? Because I can dig into data and demonstrate to you how centralized companies often suffer catastrophic "hacks" that have massive socioeconomic harm to all of society. And thats just one negative aspect of centralization.
bcash's apparent purpose is to be "the real bitcoin" (lol). A decentralized network cannot remain decentralized with inherent top-down mandatory policies that will *force* node operators to increase operational costs. If you cannot agree with that then there's really no point in discussing further as you have not done enough homework and/or you don't have the framework of understanding to build off of.

@_date: 2019-02-11 15:06:47
You either did not read my post very carefully or you don't understand how the system works.


It's important to understand that the Bitcoin network is insanely over secure at the moment. Estimated bottom cost of electricity costs + HW = around $2500-3k to produce one BTC at current difficulty.
If this were not true then hash power would not keep escalating. Meaning if the cost of production was higher then the price of Bitcoin then we would see a downward trend in hashrate, a difficulty adjustment, and then it would be easier/cheaper to mine.
We are currently in a exahash state. I'm not sure if you can wrap your mind around that or even have the capability to.
We could literally lose 90% of the entire networks hashpower today and the network would still be pretty resilient against attack.
Maybe you just haven't been around long enough to have discussed mining game theory, but as the price of Bitcoin goes down so does the incentive to attack it. Attacking it will only drive the price down further so it would have to be a hostile attack. 
I suppose one could argue that bitmain is in a position to engage in a hostile attack upon the network, but it would be short-lived and it would destroy their business. I feel pretty confident that there would be an enormous Market response and with them already in big trouble financially I doubt that they would take such a risk. 
But for the sake of game theory let's assume that they do. So they work in tandem producing blocks in secret working ahead of the network and at some point they publish and cause a reorganization.
It will not take very long for the entire community to know who did it. An emergency hard fork would likely be deployed and we would start again at the block height prior to the attack.
The entire risk would be reversed, their business would suffer catastrophic failure and they will achieve very little to no financial gain from the reorganization.
Bitcoin would suffer a temporary loss of confidence. The price would probably drop significantly for at least a year. Eventually it would recover the same way that we've recovered from multi-year-bear incidence.
 This would cause a loss of confidence across the entire cryptocurrency community for sure. It would demonstrate that proof of work systems are vulnerable, as we have always known. The media would hype it as the media does but nothing will have changed. No new knowledge will be found because we've always known that this is a weak point and proof of work systems.
This would probably lead to greater innovation. We would probably see a temporary surge in PoS systems, maybe even temporary or long-term taking market share.
the important contacts to keep in your mind when reading all of this is that almost all of this does not matter unless your only focus is upon price. Bitcoin operates the same function at $10 as it does $10,000.
You can still use it the same way.  The same security mechanisms function the same way, etc.

If I understand it correctly you only need your keys for when you are opening or closing Channel, or providing some proof of fraud / Justice transaction.
This means that you can sign the transaction with a hardware wallet when needed and leave your keys offline.
I've been trying to play some mental game theory for some scripted timer solutions that would also work as well. What if you had a lan-based key server that was on a timer and only booted up for a specific minute or two when the channels need to close? This server could be Samba based so that your lightning node is time to connect to it only for that specific small window of time. Having this type of setup would also greatly reduce a hacker's ability to access the key since they would have to hack into that lan-based server and that short period of time. This could be a raspberry pi with no internet access. I could accomplish this with $20 ....a timer on the power cord and a rpi.
I don't know if that's a realistic thought or not but I feel like there's some interesting game theory there. It's a way to automate a system without human intervention but still allows for a key server for signing with low-risk.

The problem is you are not only make a incorrect assumption, you are also doing it out of context.


Yes, you can cherry pick as many failures as you like. But the raw truth is that if you have 10 companies and 5 of them put minimal effort into their product and 5 put maximal effort into their product, the maximal effort companies are statistically much more likely to succeed.

This is a common sense thing to me, do you learn geology by going to Disneyland with your Uncle Tom? Or do you learn geology by reading geology text books written by geologists?
You should consider learning Bitcoin from the people who were actually involved in creating the fundamental technologies that enabled Bitcoin to exist like dr. Adam Backs hashcash, and Nick Szabo's digigold.
These people have an intuitive understanding to not only the cryptography Behind These systems but the social experiments that follow them. You should definitely stay away from charlatans who have been called out directly by people like Szabo and Dr Back. They have already directly called out charlatans like Roger ver and Craig Wright.

I'm not sure how you have quantified this. As someone who owns an electric car I would strongly disagree.
Tesla's have a good rep for a reason. The model 3 is the safest car according to the nhtsa who's authority it is to determine exactly that. did you know that Tesla also holds the number two and the number three spot for the model x and the model s?
That's not some freakish coincidence that's called excellent engineering.
When you are driving a zoomey deathbox around everyday I would say that safety is the most important factor of any vehicle. Besides that it drives like a Ferrari. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; exaggeration here. Please whip me to death for it!
Honestly I'm a little confused by your comment it almost seems like you have some hatred for Tesla that has made you biased and unaccepting of basic facts as they relate to this manufacturer.
Did you have a pre-order for a model 3 and then got pissed over the long-range battery? Something obviously happened to you for you to have this altered perception of reality. Were you born a hater? Clearly you've never driven one and you probably have not driven other electric cars either. If you had you certainly wouldn't have this opinion.
I've driven a variety of electric vehicles and nothing even remotely compares to a Tesla at this very moment. That will of course change in the future.
as for the repair system I'm not too worried about it. there are already people teaching other people by the hundreds how to salvage and repair Tesla's. this information is coming into public domain and in the future when there are old Tesla's that need service I think that there will be a vibrant ecosystem to repair them. Competition in the market will also force them to be better in their business model.

Well, isn't that the idea of a MimbleWimble side chain? But why destroy it if everything is hidden? Seems pointless.
But you bring up a interesting thought. If there were a mathematically secure/private cryptoledger, and it had a set destruction date with a 1:1 token system for atomic cross swaps, with private end-of-life instructions for any held balances on the chain at its end of life date (receiving address), then it could be destroyed.
Its basically a mixing-chain. Instead of a mixing tx, like coinjoin, or a mixing network, like joinmarket, its a mixing chain. All of these examples would have a open/close. 
I guess it could work, with the right privacy guarantee's. ....maybe you did have the right idea, under specific conditions!

This needs to be repeated endlessly in these circular arguments. I understand that your 'XYZ' country has shitty bandwith due to horrible regulation landscape where capitalism has been allowed to override the rights of users.
I think its obvious at this point that there are going to be a lot of countries that *absolutely will not* be able to reasonably participate in these higher level activities. Running a node is a technical contribution to a distributed network and should only be done if your environment allows for it.
If bitcoin is going to keep pace with reality, then it will need to expand and grow, and the excuses of 'XYZ' about bandwith are not justifiable excuses to cripple the network.
What is lost from 'XYZ' will be gained from others. People all over north and south america, europe, and all of asia can still run nodes with no problems.
Remember that you can still be a user on the network. You can still have a wallet, own bitcoin, do whatever you want with it. I know you want to help, but you can best help by allowing bitcoin to expand with the growth and not inhibit it with pleas about your countries poor bandwith.
Even at 2mb thats 300gb of your 500gb plan and that is cutting your usage severely to the point where you are diminishing your normal internet needs. I just dont think its realistic for someone with your limitations to run a node.

this statement right there is enough for everyone to conclude that you've not spent a single moment researching this and instead you are flaunting and opinion that is heavily influenced by your entrenchment.
You do realize that people have researched this right? Wealth isn't invisible it's a tangible thing that can be empirically measured. The problem is that most of Donald Trump's wealth accounts comes from Donald Trump. almost every article you see claiming that he is worth x amount of billions if you follow the paper trail you realize that ultimately the source of this net worth is Donald Trump himself. Ironically, this is exactly what happened with the whole "bitcoin is causing global warming" nonsense, which [was addressed here]( This scenario should help demonstrate how information can be propagated by "reputable" sources, when the original content is not reputable.
Most of this false information has come from Forbes. Fortunately the guy who was involved in all of the gathering of this information has come out and shared with the world that most of it is false.
I have some doubts that you'll actually read this entire article but here is most of the story of his lies as it relates to inflating his wealth to Forbes.
Now if you truly want to understand what a bumbling fool and massive loser Donald Trump is in regards to wealth you will actually try to soak in the research that exists into his finances, which I have posted at the bottom of this comment.
Tldr? Donald Trump was given nearly half a billion dollars and would actually be negative several hundred million if he didn't engage in fraud to evade taxes. Yep, this is the "winner" you like to gloat about. I don't know about you, but I dont define "success" as "engaging in criminal enterprise". If your success only happens when you engage in criminal activity what is the cost to society? If you deduct the cost of damages to society out of the gains, and you are left with negative, then you were never really successful were you? At least, not by the way that most of society measures the way we phrase "success". Success in the business world is supposed to be "above the board", meaning that you obey the law and make your money fair and square. Sure, criminals can be successful with their business ventures, but its a different kind of success. HSBC was "successful" in their path to maximize liquidity by accepting billions in cartel money, but at what cost to society? How much strength did they lend to violent cartel business by legitimatizing their capital ventures? Of course none of this would even happen if we legalized drugs, but thats a topic for another day.
Donald Trump is and will always be a rent-seeker who uses criminal enterprise to maximize his gains. This is not something you should be proud to represent, but I have a feeling you will continue to do so regardless of this information eh?

Yes. Tragedy of the commons fucks everything. If we do not establish councils to regulate aspects of society then tragedy of the commons will ensure madness and corruption.
There is good regulation and there is bad regulation. Finding consensus without peoples ideological entrenchments spoiling it all is the hard part. But if we base regulation off prior socioeconomic data (e.g. other countries actions and results) and we ignore peoples feelings, then we get a much better society.
This is why representative democracy based on meritocracy is good. We cannot allow mob rule, we need to elect people who will fairly represent us and are the best suited for the job. Unfortunately, here in the usa, we are vastly under-educated and are manipulated on a emotional base level and we vote with our hearts instead of with our brains. This has lead to an oligarchy.

This was my very same thought as well, that a lot of the dev's are in object mode, because they have deep feelings of moral obligation to see bitcoin succeed in its best interests, to which they feel radically different about other proposals.
It seems that bitcoin does indeed have extra mechanisms on top of the quakers consensus model.  
It would almost be like if all the quaker farmers could vote on the issue by etching their vote onto their harvest carts as they come in to town, letting the elders know what side of the issue they stand on, thereby removing the stagnation from the decision process when the elders cannot come to consensus.
Since they are the providers that make society [the network] run, by providing food [mining], they have a eligible vote on these issues.

Everything in bitcoin works because of equilibriums. If bitcoin becomes "too expensive", then people will stop using it, the same way that if a resturant becomes "too popular" a segment of the population will eat at different places.
What ends up resulting is a loss of fee pressure, and then fee prices go down.
Regardless of this apparent logic, I actually don't agree with you. I think bitcoin could survive just fine with above $10 prices. The reason is because it is *impossible* to censor bitcoin. Bitcoin is *digital gold* and for this reason a $15 transaction fee to have a permanently stored non-reversible transaction is valuable.
You cannot say the same for blockchains with low security and centralized developers who have a boner for hardfork bailouts. 
But, I also see these issues (expensive fees) as standard growing pains of any business/industry/network/company. When an industry grows too big too fast it always experiences bottleneck scenarios. With bitcoin, this just means you have to pay more to get service.
Its the best problem you can have. Because while we are finalizing LN global protocols and stabilizing system intergration across multi-platform implementations of Lightning Network, **bitcoin still works**. Yes, its expensive, but it works. And while Roger and Jihan are busy [throwing money away]( attacking bitcoin to artificially increase the feerate to pump their shitcoins, bitcoin continues to work just fine despite the prices. And hopefully they are not getting back all of their wasted fee's now that Jihan is mining BCH.
Either way, attacking costs money and im sure its costed these people a arm and a leg to keep the pressure up over time. While its distributed extra costs onto the users, at least the miners have been rewarded handsomely for the security.
Personally, I don't think bitcoin should be free. I think that planning on a global system to be free is stupid, because there are costs and costs must be paid for. Users should always have to pay to use any system, but there should be as healthy and fair as competition within the market as possible to reduce cost.
The system can be gamed, but bitcoin core developers are hard at work finalizing new tech that will render a lot of these attacks as less effective.
What often isn't talked about from people on your side of the fence, is that these problems are temporary. Ya'll want to make it out like this is a problem bitcoin will have forever. While ETH switches to PoS and experiments with it, bitcoin will switch to 2nd layer tech like LN that will allow sub-satoshi transactions and fee's. 
The best data is from experiments. Im looking forward to 2018 where LN will mature and we will start to see bitcoin truly thrive at low-costs.

The best of every single industry will always be those with a personal motivation to excel. I believe and understand what you say here because I am a living example of it as someone who has always been passionate in his belief and learned very young and gained experience before education on the topic. Or rather my education was mostly self-taught.
But the anecdotal does not eliminate the macro perspective. Having the best of the best does not eliminate the need for the rest of the majority. We still need the majority of people to be educated and able-bodied workers to meaningfully commit to an economic Society. That can't happen without rigorous educational standards and opportunities.
This is about barriers. Creating a large barrier to entry will eliminate the majority of participants within the ecosystem. If you eliminate the barrier to education then you will increase the amount of people who receive education which will then increase the amount of people who become meaningfully contributors to society.
Privatizing education and jacking up the cost of it so that only the rich can do it without being indebited for Life only creates a vicious circle of debt that I think most bitcoiners could agree is a bad thing.
Also I don't really understand your original position speaking about decentralizing the aspects of it. Your example did not provide illumination as to the decentralized aspect of it, could you please try to elaborate better so that I can better understand?

Hopefully you already knew the answers to these questions prior to asking them, and that they were just philosophical questions to have the person you are asking ponder.
If you did not know the answer, you definitely have no place being a moderator here, let alone trying to tell people what is good or bad for bitcoin.
A fork in the codebase that was willingly adopted specifically as a separated currency would of course be considered a altcoin.
The defining difference between a 'forkcoin' and a 'altcoin' in your feathercoin example would be the fact that *there was no competing chain*. Since the chain's did not compete against each other, there was no discussion of consensus, which means those are two separate currencies. There's even less muck considering this was all planned and adopted with those parameters in mind.
And yes, these distinction's are *absolutely important*, especially when you are using your moderator powers to censor discussion of terminology you clearly lack understanding in.
As a many year content providers and participant here, I would like to say directly to you:
Apologize. Admit that you were wrong, and that it was not your place to interfere with the mechanism that makes bitcoin thrive. Debate, voting, consensus, divergence...these are all aspects of bitcoin that must be hashed out in public, and this is not Those are concepts built into the core concept of bitcoin, the whitepaper and the codebase.

Yes. It actually already does. If you look at the fee rewards of each block, they currently hover around 1.8-2.4BTC. Thats like 15-25k per block. And we just for the first time had a block that had fee's that were a greater amount that the 12.5 block reward. Not that it hasn't happened by mistake before, but because all tx's looked normal fee wise, no one made a big mistake.
But the $ reward for 12.5 @ $600 (what miners were making this time last year around july/august) is only $7500. Miners are getting $15-25k on tx fees alone.
So the network already has more than enough capital to secure it even if we removed the blockreward today!


Yes, bitcoin core developers would use the term "Near Parity" (or something similar) in regards to security. LN is very slightly less secure, but only from a theoretical perspective, not a real world perspective. The cost to successfully attack either would be monumentally expensive. If you have 10B to throw at destroying bitcoin....why not buy bitcoin ? :)


Market based solutions, and its already happening with Japenese giant GMO getting into ASIC manufacturing. We will see more competitors, and that will hopefully balance things out. Beyond that, the only solution is a proof of work change. Obviously a last resort option.


1 confirmation would be less secure. You would have to wait longer. With LTC you wait 6 confirmations before you consider it secure. With bitcoin its 1. You can never change this parameter because you cannot change the laws of physics. You must wait for a reasonable amount of proof of work to be achieved so as to statistically isolate the chances of a 51% attack being constructed.
Beyond that, you are increasing resource usage on the network. More blocks = more space.
3rdly, you reduce the effectiveness of market mechanisms. If there are no barriers, then there is no bidding. If there is no bidding then there is no market.
It also would screw with the fee estimation algorithm.


So we would have to assume changing the difficulty is a hardfork, and yes this would create potential split scenarios (which is just a dirty form of inflation if you think through it). But thats not the reason to not do it, though it would be a reason to express caution for any upgrade. The reward needs to be better than the risk, by many fold.

But now? No dice man, you gotta learn the trade first. Unless you are interested in internship somewhere, in which case I would suggest crawling the bitcoin space and emailing every single company if they have possible internships!

I can't tell if you're being purposely intellectually dishonest here or are just not researched enough on the topic to realize how incorrect you are. Yes we do think that the Bitcoin blockchain should be a fundamental storage of value first because you have to build security into the base layer and then expand upon that secure base to add other features.
If you try to add other features first without securing the base then you just end up with an insecure system. Bitcoin as an insecure system is absolutely worthless so how well is that currency going to work for you if no one is willing to accept it?
Every Bitcoin proponent wants both valuable Bitcoin and fast cheap easy free transactions. The fundamental difference is that Bitcoin core wants to ensure that Bitcoin remains secure and censorship resistant so that it can resist nation state attacks on its monetary system. That's first priority. So the solution to get both is second layer cache Networks.
There is absolutely no reason for a forever ledger to store your dank meme Pepe and coffee transactions. There is zero benefit to society for redistributing the cost of resources upon node owners to store your 5 billion Frappuccino transactions.
We must leave the forever Ledger for transactions that actually have fundamental value to society and all of the rest of the crap transactions that have no fundamental value to society should be put on second layer cache Networks that do not need to store your transaction forever.
The Bitcoin core approach will get both scenarios. It will get both a secure Bitcoin and cheap fast and easy transactions.
The Bitcoin cash approach however will fail and accomplishing both of these scenarios. Sure it can have fast cheap and easy payments but so can thousands of other shity all coins with low security. And the blunt truth is that a decentralized cryptocurrency will never be able to compete with the efficiency of centralized systems like PayPal.
Bitcoin cash is a age-old bait and switch tactic. It's a we need to sacrifice Liberty for temporary security scenario. They are going to subsidized near free transactions by redistributing the cost upon the note operators of the network. But that is a horrible long-term solution because it's simply won't last because once resources become too high then you won't have any consumers running nodes anymore only data centers and then you have a centralized system.
If you were going to end up with a centralized system than what's the point of advocating for decentralization and dealing with all the complexity that comes with it? Why try to compete against centralized systems like PayPal with a inefficient decentralized system that will only work less well than PayPal?
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:21:47
Yes because in engineering you don't work in false dichotomies you work with trade-offs. The problem with segwit2x was that there was no positive trade-off for the increase to block size. I don't see subsidizing the cost of bitcoin from the people using Bitcoin onto the backs of altruistic node operators as a positive change and I think that most developers probably don't either.
But what if alongside the block size increase we eliminated most of the hard Fork wish list and improved privacy and fungibility? Those are some pretty important trade-offs to consider that would justify the increase of block size Beyond where we already are now.

Gee, why hasn't the "free market" fixed this problem them? Whats stopping these sillicon valley billionares from creating a startup to challenge google? Or why not another kid in a basement?
This is why regulation is essential in society. Power consolidates. It is a law of nature. If we do not setup frame work to regulate monopolies, they will continue to fist us in the ass until our asses become our mouths.
Even godfather of freemarket gospel, Alan Greenspan [admitted to congress]( his self-regulating free market ideology was flawed and resulted in massive losses to society. I guess all the free marketers leave that fact out when they proselytize their religion.


He then admits that 40 years of his ideology was proven wrong.
sorry 6to23 for piggy backing your reply, I get heated up. Your awesome.
PS - Im a big believer in capital market mechanisms. I think they are the best way to handle a lot of systems in society. I just recognize that markets are gamed and that deregulation in monopolized markets is not the solution. Some markets are more fair than others (because of regulation) and some markets have no competition at all (because of lack of regulation).

The only rational downside was that it was a slightly complex solution in terms of implementation on servicers side. It took real developer man hours to implement, which cost businesses money.
The rational counter balance to that the same businesses are saving crap loads of money on Bitcoin fees by using segwit. James Lopp from bitgo recently stated that his customers have saved over $100,000 by switching to segwit.
I think the correct point of view is to understand that Bitcoin is not about free lunch and when the ecosystem needs to upgrade and you run a business within the ecosystem that you're going to have to upgrade along with it regardless of how much it cost you because remember you've been making money off the back of the industry.
The things that Libertarians have right is that ecosystems work better when people take individual responsibility for their actions and contribute meaningfully to that Society. It's when you get tragedy of the commons interfering with Society by an excess of deadbeats that problem start to crop up.
For example take coinbase probably the largest Bitcoin entity in the world has had two years to implement segwit but instead of doing so they try to do a hostile hard Fork instead.
Don't be a deadbeat like coinbase, thinking that you can subsidize your business cost on to the backs of node operators because you can't be fucked to implement the latest upgrades in the code base.

Got a source on that? From my reading that [doesn't appear true](








I read that entire thing and there's a lot of great discussion there about tradeoffs, pros vs con's, etc, but the general takeaway is that the Tesla absolutely **does** compete with the preformance of a ferarri, and even does better than the highest rated ferarri's in specific tests.
You can feel however you want, and I will feel however I want. This is a relevant discussion about apples to oranges in a lot of circumstances.
But claiming Tesla does not outpreform most of these cars in terms of speed, accelleration, handling, etc is a pointless endeavor. It does, in a lot of circumstances, and doesn't, in others. If you want to compare the 'luxury' aspects (e.g. those that have nothing to do with preformance) then obviously there are *tons* of stupidly expensive cars that beat tesla...and I frankly don't give a shit about any of that. 
I stand by my *opinion*.

Yes, miners can individually decide to change consensus rules, and node operators can decide to reject their blocks.....so no, miners do not get to "decide consensus"...they get to be a group of actors within a space. That's it. They cannot build Consensus without the rest of the network, otherwise they build themselves into a new altcoin where their consensus becomes the new ruleset, partitioning themselves away.

How about you present a single free market? If you are going to reject the premise as being absurd then you should have no problem giving me a **single** example, right?
Ok, I'll wait for you to provide one.


The same way it works now. Representative democracy. We will never achieve consensus at a social layer without representatives. Thats the entire reason representative democracy was created, because we know it doesn't work at a single bottom layer.


I would call a black market a black market. Black markets are not free markets because they are prone to the same power consolidation forces as any other market. A manufacturer of guns can dominate the black market through lower cost distribution. Governments and militia's can dominate black markets through elimination of competition within the sector. Every market is subject to power consolidation without regulation. This is the entire reason we have anti-monopoly laws.
You dont really think black markets are free markets just because they are black markets do you? Because they are actually more prone to power consolidation specifically because we do not regulate them with anti-monopoly laws. Its a double edged sword, fucked if you do fucked if you dont.
The truth is that free markets only exist at small scales. Only in communities that have no exterior forces. It must be a completely closed loop economy, small in size, in order for the free market to exist.

The most robust development team combined with first mover network effects. Adam Back the creator of hashcash, credited by Satoshi in the Bitcoin white paper as the backbone for bitcoins proof of work system runs a company named blockstream that pays the salaries of open source Bitcoin developers. There are more heavy hitter cryptographers working for Bitcoin than any other crypto. These people are on the forefront of creating new technologies that will allow such a complex decentralized system to maximize it's potential.
That's not to say there is not talent elsewhere in the field, there definitely is, cryptocurrencies are a hot new industry that is attractive to developers and math academics. 
Nick Szabo, also cited in the white paper is a major Bitcoin proponent and proselytizes about the power of ethereums smart contracts. But ETH is very different from BTC, they are experimenting with a new proof of stake system to go away from mining in 2018 ...it's a risky endeavor that has large upsides if it succeeds.  The downside to eth is the massive amount of currency it has minted, making it not nearly as scarce as Bitcoin. If Bitcoin is gold, eth is copper (still quite valuable).
There are other promising cryptocurrencies like Dash Monero and zcash that offer greater privacy guarantees over what Bitcoin currently offers which means that they do have a fundamental advantage over Bitcoin in terms of fungibility. The best of these in that the system that provides the best cryptographic guarantees is Monero. The problem with Monero is in order to offer the Privacy guarantees it requires much more in terms of resources for storing it's blockchain.
The problem with all decentralized currencies is that the more resources they require the more centralizing effects that occur on the nodes that must carry the blockchain data. Monero is going to be massively larger than Bitcoin. If it takes 10 terabytes to store the data on a node then you're not going to have average people running nodes and if you don't have average people running nodes then it's not really decentralized.
The great thing about Bitcoin is that it can adopt and mold itself after all of these improvements created by other coins to a certain extent. Take rootstock for example which is launching in a few weeks which will allow ethereum style contracts on the Bitcoin Network.
And there was a new paper released by some Bitcoin developers that demonstrated a new type of proof that will allow the blinding of amounts sent on the public Ledger. Combining this now proof system with already existing coinjoin mixing technologies will allow people to increase privacy. Once the Bitcoin network is upgraded to a upcoming feature called MAST and schnorr signatures we will see these types of privacy transactions be incredibly cost and resource efficient and also look exactly like normal transaction so it is impossible to distinguish which transaction is attempting to maximize privacy.
 So the two biggest selling points of ethereum and other privacy enhanced cryptos like Montero Dash and zcash will be features integrated into Bitcoin, likely 2018. This fact combined with the most advanced development team and continued first-mover Advantage is what makes Bitcoin pretty darn Bulletproof. Also consider that Bitcoin has the strongest proof of work security by very very very far.

@_date: 2019-02-03 16:12:57
The reason is because different coins serve different purposes.bitcoins script implementation is specifically minimize to reduce attack vectors as it relates to security.
But there are other coins that have specific technological purposes or highly expanded script to allow for complex financial transactions.
With the lightning Network and atomic cross swaps this means that we can utilize features as they exist on other cryptocurrencies with the security of the lightning Network.
At this time in point I think that it is arguable with certain coins having more security than the lightning Network but in the long-term I think that these arguments will disappear due to the lightning Network having a long track record in resilience. This is of course speculation and can only be proven in time.p

First, I would like to thank every single one of *you*. Every user, every hodler, this backing out is thanks to the social persistence of education that you have put forward.
Every deflection from every company, whether founded in technical merit, was compounded by the outreach of *users* informing these companies that they did not want a oligarchy in bitcoin.
We have spoken, said **no** to attempting to govern bitcoin, despite its foundations being in a non-governance system.
I think we should also take a moment to thank the B2X proponents for *actually doing the right thing* and not steamrolling forward with a bernie or bust attitude, a  "to the hell with the health of bitcoin we want our cake now" attitude that they seemingly embraced for the past few months.
Im grateful for them recognizing that they would do much more destruction than good.
But let us also not pretend that this is not a way to save face. If bitcoin had gone through this attack, and miners defected to the legacy chain once they were loosing 100's of millions in mining revenue, it would have shown the B2X movement for the farce that it is.
B2X was like a magician who's tricks were obvious to the shows participants. Only the really dumb fell for their shoddy tricks.

Ok, lets take a look at this. That tx says 1,381.579 sat/B @ 	2017-11-12 13:07:29
Lets examine what the actual fee's were at exactly that time shall we?
Hover your mouse over 11-12 @ 13:08 ....There were a 169k tx's during that period, and only 2,485 of those 169,893 transactions paid over 1000 sat byte.
At a quick glance, transactions of sat/byte between 280 and 450 seemed to be the largest # of transactions in the queue. 
So it looks like you triple over-paid for your transaction. If you want to complain to anyone, perhaps you should look in the mirror and ask yourself why when the waiter asked you to pay your $20 bill, you handed him $60 and said "keep the change" ?

You've seem to not understood this from the get go. You were part of a closed door agreement and private communication backdoor channels where decisions were made outside of the public eye.
Don't you find it incredibly hypocritical to postulate that a few dozen developers from around the world working on a open source, open peer review public github project is "centralized" while you and **literally 5 other people** "called off" a "grassroots movement" aka S2X to attempt to "upgrade" (aka takeover) the bitcoin network?
Lets examine the btc1 devlist where the [cnacellation was posted](


Ok. Now, lets play a little thought experiment.
How much in capital assets and network resources do you think these 6 people, including yourself, owns? &gt; 100M ? &gt; 1B ? ...and how much in terms of bitcoin network resources? You operate a large exchange, so do you think you could claim 1 or 3% of network activity? What about when you combine coinbase and bc.i ? Maybe 30% of network activity? Maybe 50% ? 
Now, lets take the [top 10 github bitcoin contributors](


How much do you think these people own in capital assets,and how  much ownership of network resources do they have?
I would wager probably less than 10M, and **0 network resources**. 
Now, who do you think represents a larger threat to the decentralization of the network? The largest monopolies in bitcoin getting together and making backroom deals?
Or open source developers contributed code to a publicly reviewed github repo?
You are creating a false premise by trying to postulate that open source developers are a "centralization risk" to bitcoin.

The compromise was upgrading segwits block weight to be 4 megabytes. Segwit could have retained the one megabyte block size weight.
If these businesses we're serious about the urgency to need more block space than they would have already upgraded to segwit.
The fact that they have not upgraded shows that this has always been a political debate about control, and that they don't see the urgency to free up block space and reduce fees.
The hypocrisy of companies like bitpay and coinbase complaining about bad protocol management while refusing to upgrade their systems despite having nearly two years to do so shows how malicious these actors are and how we should not trust them.
It's also quite stupid of them to attempt to capture regulatory control of Bitcoin when it's the decentralized non-governance structure of Bitcoin that enables them to operate unhindered. It's almost as if the CEOs are too stupid to understand that if they collude and demonstrate that they can control Bitcoin that they think that they will escape regulatory action from legislators in their respective countries.
I'll be very happy to see these businesses fail.

You really shouldn't use words you don't understand. Appeal to authority applies mostly to **non-authorities**. When you use a *actual authority* in a appeal to authority its considered a inductive form of reasoning.
Trying to claim that charlie lee, the head developer of litecoin, is *not* an authority is absolutely moronic.

Is your assumption that the reward is mostly gone? If you push through the numbers you'll realize this is a very, very *very* long way aways.
Bitcoin ran just fine at $600 with a 12.5 btc reward. Nothing but steady increases in hashpower. What do you think the price of btc will be in 2020? 15k? 25k? Lets just assume that its 10k. 10k @ 6.25 btc is $60,250.00 per block. It was @ $7500 per block in july of 2016 after the halving, and we all know what happened to hashrate then.
It skyrocketted.
Lets assume, at an extremely conservative value, that btc is 20k by 2024. Thats $62,500.00 usd @ 3.25 btc.
And I expect this to continue on at this rate for however long bitcoin exists. Yes, bitcoin *can* keep going up and will, because its a limited supply resource who's purpose is being massively integrated into society.
Gold will have only ever been used for speculation and as a hedge against inflation. People cant *use* gold (except for its edge case uses in electronics, jewelry, etc). 
But for however many purposes there is for gold, there will be a thousandfold utilitarian purposes for btc.
This will make its scarce resource properties continue to accelerate its value over time.
Eventually, a 0.39 btc reward (2036) will be worth more than the 12.5 btc reward today. Yes, I think its more than reasonable to see a 100k btc in 20 years. No, im not crazy. Thats literally 4 doublings.
We will have 4 doublings when we hit 11.2k from july 2016. We are already at 3x! 3 doublings in 1 year. Think of how crazy that is. Think of the potential btc has when you put that into perspective. If we can double 3 on a good year, then its not irrational to think we could have a few doublings every 4 years. At 2 doublings, mining rewards double in profitability ever 4 years.
People dont realize how quickly btc will accelerate in value. Its not about how much it gains, its about its doublings. 100 to 200 in value is just as big as a jump as 25k to 50k!


So long as there is valuable btc and a reward, then this does not apply. Its gonna be a verrrrrry long time before that is the case. Also, it won't effect hashrate/difficulty very much, it will just cause a little mayhem on the fee market algorithms.

So, I read the link you provided, read the transcripts and frankly im not seeing where the fire is. Can you be specific as to what the problem is here?
Everyone has private channels. I've been on IRC for over 20 years, I am still in private channels. Im sure the developers have private channels they participate in. 
All that matters is the code is public, in a open source repository. The developers are human beings, they have personal opinions, and frankly its best that they dont share them. There are too many toxic people in our community who's sole purpose seems to inflame the community, divide and conquer.
I would rather developers talk in private about their personal feelings on subject, and then when it comes to work/coding that they discuss all of it in the open, as they do on their IRC developer chats.
What you seem to be indicating here is that you think its not ok for bitcoin developers to be in private channels. I think you are derranged, and in need of some serious emotional therapy if you think that human beings should not have the right to privacy when sharing their personal thoughts.

This is a very stupid straw man. Blockstream does not control Bitcoin and they do not control lightning Network. It's a network protocol with multiple open source implementations. 
Of course everyone knows this except you. So all you've done is made a laughingstock of yourself.
Since your tiny mind can't understand why blockstream would do this I'm going to blow your mind with a very simple concept - it's called investment into the future.
If you are a major grain distributor in the 1600s, you might take proceeds from your revenue and have more roads built so that more wagons travel through your distribution area. The roads will never pay you back because they are just roads, instead it is the increased traffic on those roads that will lead to much higher volume sales. If you try to build a toll road the people might just say screw that and never come to you. 
Blockstream is invested on the Enterprise side of Bitcoin land. They are making institutional products for a different class of providers in the business ecosystem, e.g. exchanges. So they are investing into the technology with a long-term vision, because they know that the more that the network succeeds, the more businesses that will end up buying their Enterprise products.
If you would stop smoking bleach and spent the same amount of time doing business studies as you do reading conspiracy theories in the dumbest place on Earth, then you might actually dig yourself out of the psychosis you have gotten into.

We will never rely upon miner flag signaling (like we did with bip9/141)again so you don't have to worry about this. Rusty Russell [wrote in his blog]( years ago that the drama was his fault and that he didn't foresee it.
In the future we are much more likely to have a specific day set far in the future and which changes will go live, giving ample time for people to upgrade.
this is my understanding from years of reading commentary from various Bitcoin developers. If something has changed in the last year or so I've not heard about it. Here is an article from Bitcoin developer Eric Lombrozo that talks about it....
So if we are to set a future activation date in the far future than nine months would probably be a minimum threshold. So if the schnorr proposal is assigned a BIP by March the earliest we would probably see activation is Q1 2020, IMO.

Of course its a appeal to authority, im going to favorably side with satoshi's vision for this project because he seems by far the most suited to evaluate and decide. I am okay with Satoshi being my benevolent dictator the same as I am okay with Linus doing the same for the Linux foundation. As for it being not correct, directly from the whitepaper:


According to the whitepaper consensus is directly derived from miners voting on which block to accept or reject. You can speculate with semantics all you wish, I do not care for your philosophical ramblings. I will take satoshi's words literally because they directly apply to the topic, while you want to wander in the ether discussing philosophy. Its people like you who stall things, and people like satoshi who make decisions, getting things done.

I agree with the spirit of your comment but I think that the example is not analogous enough.
I think a better example would be BitTorrent And if every single user of BitTorrent suddenly had to store double the database size to use the program. Say your movie archive was 130 GB and suddenly the creators of BitTorrent made a change that required you had to store other people's archives which increase the size to 260 GB.
What would naturally happen is that a lot of people would stop using the service because they don't have the space or don't want to utilize the space for that purpose. This would then have effects upon the security of the network.

@_date: 2017-11-09 15:53:43
I don't see how an arms race to maximize storage while minimizing footprint is very much different to an asic arms race.  Both require massive manufacturing and energy consumption.
In the end one must ask how much Security will cost in terms of footprints and energy consumption? If hard drives are cheap then that will simply mean that the amount of proof of storage required to participate in the network if it becomes popular will be massive. Will an entire data center filled with racks and hard drives really consume less energy than a closet full of Asics?
Security has to do with the cost of the attack not with the implementation of the technology. All Cohen is going to do is increase the stock market value of hard drive manufacturers while he pumps his altcoin. It's not going to end up serving the purpose that he intends.
This is just like Bitcoin scaling issue. If a blockchain becomes popular it will suffer the same scaling issues that Bitcoin does. And if Chia becomes popular it will suffer the same attack vectors as proof of work except it will just simply require more physical storage space.
So in the end I suppose that these theories must be tested in real-world applications which require implementation and usage. So I applaud, and for sticking his neck out and trying something new who knows maybe it is more efficient but we won't know until it's been tested. I have my doubts however.

- No where in that reply did I see an apology. I saw a lot of weaseling out of apologizing by trying to rationalize that S2X was worth it "because it got us segwit".
That absolutely was not the tune you sung during the entire S2X debate. I don't think I've actually *ever* seen you use that as a rationale since the start of this madness.


If the NYA was created to implement SegWit, then I would be right there with you. But it wasn't. It was an attempt by central actors with consolidated forces within the ecosystem to force an involuntary and incompatible change upon the bitcoin network.
That goes directly against a voluntaryism philosophy, which I thought you adhered to, but maybe im mixing you up with someone else.
Frankly, im disappointed that I tee'd up a chance for you to redeem yourself in this and you failed. You've made some incredibly minor admissions but at the heart of it it seems your ego is bigger than your brain.
You are an operator of one of the larger exchanges in the world. Shapeshift has always been a leader in the space. You know what competent developers are. You understand the review process.

Well that was a lot of writing to say nothing.
Im so stoked for your "research" (to which you've presented no evidence), but trying to imply that LN node operators are any different from miners from a regulatory POV is blantantly false. Trying to distinguish between the two from a money transmitter POV is just semantics.
Its ok to engage in game theory on a topic to extrapolate meaning. However I don't think you've researched this very much as there is not any greater attack surface from a regulatory POV from LN node operators or miners. Both fall under the same umbrella.
Good luck regulating either one of those. Unless you want to get your local congressman or woman to sponsor a new trade agreement with every single nation on the planet to make mining illegal? Or apply AML/KYC to miners? Even if such a monumental never-happened (and not going to) did happen, how would they enforce that regulation? 
The same way they enforce copyright law? Yea, how hard is it to sidestep that? Used bittorrent anytime in the last 10 years?

Nearly every single rumor that has come out of China has ended up being true in some sense. Every single China ban Bitcoin scenario was always an attempt at regulation. And those attempts at regulation actually shut exchanges down. It changed their practices and their legal requirements.
Why do you think that we don't have zero fee trading in China anymore? Why do you think that we don't have ico's being launched in China anymore? Why do you think that CNY deposits we're halted for so long? You think these exchange operators just behaved this way because they woke up on the wrong side of the bed that day?

Yes, but the system relied on a very basic assumption - That what is best for the person is best for the network.
With anti-competitive POW cheating mechanisms like asicboost, and exploiting social vectors (fork shitcoin, engineer drama with artificial fee increase attacks, social media propaganda, FUD, pump shitcoin etc),  these things are *not good for the network*, yet they *are* good for the person exploiting them. This destroys that prior assumption.
Forking bitcoin and manufacturing consent through propaganda machines is another form of inflation. Yes, it was bound to happen, and yes with time and education we will hopefully see this through, but please lets stop engaging in false dichotomies. The situation is not black and white, and simple thinking will not unveil the complexity of the situation.
Yes, this is a age old example of weak hands vs strong hands and intellectual investors vs newbies. But there are effects and we cannot ignore them.
The old formula is semi-broken. The assumptions are no longer true. I say semi-broken because its still functional, but definitely weaker. I feel its very important to dispel the old addage, that bitcoin relies upon miners being greedy. Yes, that is true, under perfect conditions. Those conditions are no longer perfect and we have scenarios now where the greed of miners combined with things like EDA, bitcoin shitforks and asicboost create a environment where the greed can be used *against* the health of the network.
The way to route around this is to continue engineering progressive solutions to the problems. Fortunately bitcoin has the most talented developers by a long shot, so we know that progress will be made on bitcoin and little on the others. With regards to social attacks, education and constant vigilance is key. Hence this post.
There is nothing we can do about the financial attacks. If roger wants to waste 10 million a year fucking over btc's fee rate to pump his shitcoin, theres nothing we can do about it. So long as legacy blockspace exists with old transaction formats supported, he will exploit that vector. The rest of the world can move forward with SegWit, Schnorr, MAST tx's and reduce the burden of the network while he throws his money away.

The scenario you describe is non-existant. Its pointless to wax philosophical about unrealistic scenarios which will never come to pass.
The fee market is exactly that .... a market. This means there will always be competitive bidding for a valuable resource. Thats the entire point of not having a unbounded blocksize.
The argument from big blockers is that we are artificially restricting blockspace. But the obvious counter argument to that is that without the restriction a true free market to determine the price of blockspace cannot occur.
Ironically, this argument from big blockers always comes from free market idealists. They argue against their own philosophy. But like most people I come across from these ideological directions, they all want/need perfect utopia scenarios in order for their theories to work in society.
Life isn't perfect. We must deal with the complexities of society and human diversity through tried solutions, e.g. market based.

I think that's a pretty valid point, but how often do we deal with large sub decimal numbers? I think Bitcoin is really the first time in money that we will be commonly using so many decimal places. Maybe you are correct in that we need a way to break up the decimals now...... Or more realistically we will just integrate new standards like mbtc and make those the default.
I suppose that we could do it like this.... 1.200.287.476 and assume that the first decimal is the decimal that breaks the number. But using commas would be weird. 1.200,287,476

I don't think it's hazy it's just something you have to realize has a sliding scale to it. Hey if you run a node and all you do is buy apalca socks once a year then obviously you'll be on one side of the scale and exchanges Fiat gateways wallet providers are going to be on the other end of the sliding scale.
Participants on this scale have varying degrees of impact upon the network. I would say that it it's something that could be measured and should be measured so that we can have a better idea as to which nodes are stronger economic indicators.

So long as Bitcoin cash exist then it is not over. Since it's pretty obvious now that Bitcoin cash is here to stay I also think it's pretty obvious that we will continue to see coordinated attacks continue 2 attempt to manipulate market prices.
It's going to be the same shit over and over and over. Flood mempool with high fee transactions whose sole purpose is simply to artificially increase the fee structure of Bitcoin in an attempt to move ecosystem participants over to bitcoin cash.
This is no different than owners of a Marketplace ddosing another marketplaces domain so that the customers cannot buy the products there and must move over to the stable domain that is currently open for business.
The principal is the same, attack the network make it unusable and force people over to your usable Market.
While I do not advocate Bitcoin developers attacking Bitcoin cash I certainly do advocate random white hat and black hat hackers around the world working together to find vulnerabilities and Bitcoin cash publicizing them and executing them. I also Advocate pure review of their code base and public disclosure of bugs.
I feel that this is an unfortunate tragedy of the commons scenario. The proponents of Bitcoin cash have hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars to spare constantly attacking the Bitcoin Network for as long as we live and obviously do not have any moral limits that will dissuade them from doing so.
Yet on the Bitcoin side we have a high moral set of developers who wont attack the other side. 
This means that the Bitcoin cash attacks on fee rates will continue until the technology routes around these attacks. So long as Legacy transactions and Legacy block space exists they will continue to exploit these vectors to increase their market share.

For what gain? If blockspace was such a critical issue then the companies who have now had **two years** to implement segwit would have done so. The fact that they have not demonstrates that blockspace and fees are not really such an enormous issue.
If you are going to propose reducing the latency of the network a parameter that has serious ramifications upon the health of the network then there better be a massive gain that's going to come with changing that metric. 
Increasing the block size for a political reason is not a technical parameter. That is not a trade-off nor it is a net benefit change to the network. A rational engineer would understand that making a trade for a political gain is a detriment to the network.

Someone's been smoking the Kool-Aid. The price of bch is heavily manipulated. 90% of its volume is on a zero fee Exchange. There is little to no liquidity in the market and it's very easy to accelerate the price.
This is not the case with eth. 
If what you speculate happens it will only be a very short-term event.
You have to ask yourself what fundamentally does bch offer that eth does not? And what does eth offer that bch does not? If after exploring these questions you come to the realization that bch offers absolutely nothing and eth actually has a endless amount of valuable use cases then welcome to reality.

Segwit is a 2-3mb blocksize increase that has a balanced weighting to fix economic incentives to encourage people to transact in a way that reduces utxo.
S2X increased the "legacy space" (aka non-SW area) from 1mb to 2mb, not taking advantage of segwits improvements, and **doubling** the maximum blockspace usage by changing the "weight" to 8mb.
They wanted to shortcut the situation by allowing people to transact more on the legacy space, even with the full knowledge that doing so opens the network up to non-trivial ddos attacks, and compounds the already-existing problems.
So they were going to trade off resource usage, implement it the worst way possible, minimizing benefits and maximizing disruption and elimination of security, and double it to boot?
Its technical and complicated, but they wanted to do this a really shitty way, and yes, it does indeed **double** the potential resource usage comparatively to legacy bitcoin with segwit enabled.

It was present on this sub for 12-24 months from 2013 to mid 2014, maybe 2015 but not very much. The head mod, theymos got a Streisand boner for banning "altcoin talk" as a way to prevent discussion about bitcoin XT. He tried to use his finger to tip the scale in favor of incumbent bitcoin. Lots of regulars (like myself) were very outspoken against this policy. Hell, I was even suspended a few times for causing a ruckus. 
This had a nasty effect however, because people hate being manipulated, and combined with a "thought leader" (Mike Hearn, Gavin), a entire new ecosystem was created out of disenchanted users who felt spurred by this censorship and was born.
After a few years, theymos realized the error of his ways and stopped being a censorship nazi. We have had open discussion for 2 + years now with no censorship other than practical moderation that eliminates toxicity.
I cannot speak for what went on internally, but is one of the most active mods here and I think he was against the censorship. His moderation has reflected this as he has not touched "alt coin" discussion for a very long time. Also, many mods left at the time over theymos's censorship policy actions, so it created a fractured environment that likely eventually influenced his decisions.

You are assuming that bitcoin core is going to rely upon miners using bip9 for future upgrades. Rusty russell has already admitted the flaws behind bip9 and apologized for helping create the political deadlock that has ensured. Dev's have already admitted bip9 will probably never be used again, and instead deploying upgrades via bip8 (soft fork + flag height activation). This eliminates the politics and miners, so yes, bitcoin will be upgraded *just fine* in the future, it just wont rely upon unreliable actors in the space.

Sure, there were a few of those. But it was mostly astroturfing and that's a real problem we have to deal with here.
So the question is how do we differentiate between valid complaints and sock puppets spearheading propaganda campaigns to promote alt coins?
This is where the two subs have differentiating opinions. The other sub thinks that there should be no moderation and therefore allows waterfalls of puke and shit to flow freely wherever it may form.
Here we accept that in order to exist in a community where there is not literally puke and shit everywhere that we're going to have to eliminate some of the crap.

Is it established? I think the more you know about Satoshi the less you would think that. There is a **lot** of cherry picking quotes from Satoshi to support the big block narrative, but it ignores the other 99% of his postings.
Also, what is the "original white paper vision"? If you are implying that the white paper vision is pro big blocks then I don't know what to say to you because you are very disillusioned. The white paper does not go into the blocksize debate.
And no, rbtc is not a Satoshi fan club. I get that they *think* they are, but that does not make one a real one. They are mostly uneducated posers. I don't know how you could fail to acknowledge their feverent praying to known scam artists and fraudsters who are altcoin Pumpers.
Satoshi was very clear on the fact that he thought that non compatible consensus breaking Bitcoin implementations is extremely bad for Bitcoin. All of those Princess cryptopansy fanboys tend to forget that while pumping their bcash.
I would say that there cultish love for these individuals are exactly the reason they are not part of the Satoshi fan club.

I think it's important to note that the CEO of Twitter is a Bitcoin maximalist. if there were some viable legal avenue to eliminate this Twitter handle on the basis of fraud or deception I believe we would have already seen it done.
This is an example of free speech unfortunately, which presents legal complications in relation to censorship, even on a private platform.
Either that or the CEO has decided to put his Free speech principles above his personal opinion,  demonstrating good leadership. I've always thought that it's a private platform and they should be able to do what they want, which includes eliminating Twitter handles that purposely engage in fraud and deception that harm society.

The only thing that I could surmise that is "sketchy" about it is the fact that they are hiding their accounts in offshore regions, likely as a tax shelter or as a way to hide the identities of investors (and those investors are likely looking to get a ROI tax free as well). A lot of people here see that as "liberation" instead of theft, so I would imagine you'll get a mixed bag of feelings on the subject here.
As for the fact a Chinese billionare invested into bitmain...yea...that seems about right. Doesn't seem sketchy to me. Rich people are the ones that bootstrap businesses through investment. How else do startups get seed capital? Not everyone can be a early bitcoin investor.

No, the scenarios were always just misinterpreted. It was never a blanket ban. Are you ignoring the fact that exchanges stopped processing CNY transactions? How long have you been around and are you sure about this? Because I remember specifically exchanges shutting their operations down for months. I also remember the recent ICO ban being valid as well. 
All of these scenarios were misconstrued from the start but in the end they all ended up enforcing compliance.
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:50:17
Only thing that is basic here is the lack of your intellectual investment on basic facts on how Bitcoin works. Miners are taking Bitcoin in exchange for time stamping and ordering people's transactions. That is directly processing Bitcoins transactions and they are being paid to do so.
Trying to argue otherwise only reflects that you don't understand even the most basic operations of Bitcoin. Trying to claim that lightning network is any different than miners in terms of how a regulator would perceive them as servicers only shows that you do not have the intelligence to differentiate between these basic facts.

This is what I have realized is one of the biggest needs for social change. We need better educational standards that focus on rational logic and deduction skills in relation to consumption of information.
Did you know that we actually have a higher percentage of conspiracy theorists today than we did in the 1960's? The assumption was that the internet would bring a golden age of information. 
It brought it alright. It also brought the disinformation along with it, and without being taught to discern truth from fiction instead we have a highly uneducated populace that believes the earth is flat, that there are 4 kinds of aliens living on earth (white walkers lol), the moon landing was fake, and that global warming is a chinese hoax (meta conspiracy theorists, aka 2x dumb there. Its a conspiracy of a conspiracy bro!)
I would hope that we will get better, but I recognize that in the last  60 years *we have not gotten better, despite all of the technological progress of humanity*. The issue will always come down to education at a sociological level(cultural reinforcement), and whether or not we are instilling our children with the tools required to detect bullshit.

No I don't think you understand how transaction fees work. You don't want to be at the upper end of the fee Spectrum. You want to be on the lower end of the fee Spectrum meaning that you want to pay the least amount to get your transaction confirmed.
I'm on mobile and can't be fucked right now but if we take your time stamp and we look at the next block that was found how much do you want to bet that there were transactions within the 400 to 600 sat/byte range? No I'm being serious how much do you want to bet.....
Had you paid on the lower spectrum of what was being confirmed you would have still gotten confirmed you just wouldn't have triple overpaid. This also doesn't highlight the fact that had you paid a little bit under that lower spectrum that you still would have gotten confirmed in a reasonable amount of time it just wouldn't have been in the next two blocks.


$25 for a transaction that was Triple the size of a normal transaction. 602 bytes dude. Standard transaction is 192 bytes. 
That means that if you had paid the correct fee and your transaction was not triple the size then you could have gotten your transaction confirmed for $8.
$8 is a lot different than $75. The problem here is that you are conflating the issue and you're dumb and you can't do math and you don't understand how transaction fees work. That's a lot of compounding stupid into one small compact scenario. Sorry but I don't trust your opinion on the matter because you've demonstrated you don't realize how fee's work.
The only thing that's apparent here is that you don't understand how fees work and you massively overpaid for your transaction that was Triple the size of a normal transaction.
What you don't realize is that it's actually idiots like you that's causing the problem. Everyone thinks like you because they don't take the time to understand how it works so they massively overpay this becomes a circular problem where people continue to overpay and continue to overpay and continue to overpay constantly outbidding the already way too high bid.
You can take that "failing to grasp" bullshit and you can throw it in the trash. The only person who doesn't understand here is you.

@_date: 2019-06-06 14:57:20
If it were me I would look at the transaction and analyze what the sat/byte fee was and then I would compare it to what is currently clearing to see whether or not an appropriate fee was applied.
That would tell me at least whether or not it's a bee related issue.
also if you are going to do a face-to-face transaction you must put a fee that will clear in the time that you wait. Never walk away from a face-to-face transaction without one confirmation.

Holy shit did someone hire a troll army on this thread? The entire thing is filled with complaints about toxicity.
Frankly, y'all are the toxicity. When a thought leader in the crypto space condones CP, I think it's socially relevant to discuss. Yes, that means selectively moderating. Yes, I'm ok with that.
Vitaliks position is highly irrational. Legalizing CP means creating a industry out of it. There's a big difference between a black market and a fully regulated and out in the open market. The black market will be much smaller than the fully regulated market, considering the context is actually child porn dude.
Anyone that attempts to self rationalize that condoning the creation of an industry that literally exploits children sexually is fucking disgusting and these people should be ostracized from society. There is nothing to gain or benefit from sexually exploiting children. We can Embrace Liberty and freedom without fucking kids.
Vitalik included. 
Heroin is a drug that you inject in yourself. It does not harm other people. Watching kids getting fucked for your own pleasure does not eliminate the fact that those kids had to get fucked in order for you to watch it.
This is simple logic and I'm not surprised that someone like the vitalik would struggle with it. This is a clear example of an intelligent person with a Asperger syndrome or Spectrum level disorder not comprehending the cause and effect of a socially Dynamic and complex situation.
Fuck vitalik and fuck any libertarian that thinks a child porn should be legal. Scum of the fucking earth.

This is a libertarian dream that gets shattered by reality all too often. People are delusional thinking that they can go into the states courts of law, challenge the state in their own jurisdictions and come out the victor. The judicial branch may exist to balance the executive branch, but all too often we see them uphold these 'tigers without teeth' when challenged.
If this were a issue that touched upon the amendments more fundamentally, then there would be a chance of overturning it in court, but at this point I think its clear that the state would side with the state when it comes to regulating a financial asset, especially one so technical in nature that judges would have difficulty encompassing it in their minds to rule favorably, one that has resulted in the losses of large sums of money due to unregulated exchanges going rouge, getting hacked, etc. This is how the state thinks and acts and you must accept the reality to fight the reality.


I think it is irrational to assume that CoinCenter is attempting to hurt bitcoin. It is like saying Jehovah's Witnesses are going door to door to secretly help satin.
I would put the burden of explanation of why CoinCenter is wrong and hurting bitcoin on you, instead of generic explanations like you've just provided. You've not given one single ounce of explanation as to why it is bad, just philosophical statements.
The definition for certain terms need to be solidified in the language (as they always seem to do), but other than that, what else do you propose is bad about the bill? It seems to be *much* more thorough than BitLicense.

Which part of this original above statement did you fail to understand?


Do you not understand the redistribution of wealth here? By increasing the blocksize you are reducing fee's yes...at the cost of lost security to the network and a redistribution of that same cost on to the backs of node operators. 
Bitcoin isn't free. The costs are always there, its just a matter of who pays them. I would rather see a system that forces the users to pay at the point of terminal than a system that hides the costs on the back end that results in the system failing.
This like email. Maybe you use gmail because its free, but I specifically don't use gmail because its free. The cost of it is being absorbed by the selling of your personal information to 3rd parties. Its no different in bitcoin, if you remove the cost from one end of the spectrum the cost doesn't disappear, it just ends up rearing its head on another less optimal-spectrum of the network.
Node operators are a major backbone of bitcoin. Without them, its worthless. Who's going to spend their bitcoin if its worthless? You might be tempted to argue that bitcoin users are equally important, and to that you would be right. But as history has shown, bitcoin users do not stop using bitcoin when fee's get high. I've watched the price rally through the worst mempool attacks in bitcoins history over the last 2 years.

Show me evidence that a tax cut has *ever* increased economic activity. You are asking me for evidence when you are basing your premise on a widely held myth. Why are you claiming correlation isn't causation while pandering a false premise? At least in my examples the data is there to support the outcome (even if you want to argue semantics over causation), where yours is based on misinformation.
The reason that education leads to healthier economies is because having a better educated populace leads to a better-governed society. I think this is common sense that you cannot disagree with.


Democracy is worthless if you have apathetic citizenry. The less education you have, the greater the apathy. The more that you learn, the less corruption politicians can get away with. The less corruption, the better the legislation, the more favorable laws regulate society, and the most net-benefit to all.

So exchanges that act in custodial positions holding customers funds without the usage of multi-signature are considered engaging in virtual currency business.
A person who is buying/selling is not 'maintaining full custody on behalf of others'. A buyer maintains his own coin once bought, and a seller maintains the coin only after purchasing, so I believe p2p exchange is not defined as virtual currency business under this law.

Generally a very well written reply, aside of course for the soft fork snark.
Your bias is showing :¶
The only point I would make in retort is that most of these scenarios are incredibly unrealistic. Extreme examples for extreme scenarios though.
I would say the greatest viable threat you listed is a rouge dictatorship/nation state buying up hashpower, but I can't help but feel that they are smart enough to spend their money wiser. In order for this to be a viable threat, Bitcoin would have to threaten their entire financial system.
Im very critical of that happening. I just don't see Bitcoin as ever becoming that hopium dream.
Did you see the defense paper on states issuing digital currencies? I feel that is a more efficient path to taking control of power. Why fight when you can just isolate and firewall your own monetary system by introducing a state sanctioned digital currency?
I don't think wasting money on hash power is a smart move. I expect that such entities will invest appropriate resources to market research prior to doing said attacks.

semantics. It works exactly the same way. A pension is literally a pool of money which pays out future benefits. Look at the definition of a pension -


Thats literally exactly what social security is. You regularly pay into SS, and you then get a fixed sum at retirement age. The two are so similar that its pointless to argue about definitions. Again...semantics.


The government is a body of millions of citizens. Its not some boogeyman. 
Are you a anarchist? It sounds like you are. If you think that government is not necessary for a civil society then we have nothing to discuss.

Frankly I don't see how it's relevant in the digital age. Changing menu prices is a digital affair now.
When you need a new computer do you wait 6 months until there is a better one out? No, when you need it you need it and you buy it. Why would you think something as essential as food would be different?
The entire argument that a deflationary currency would lead to ruin is old school dogma. There are plenty of examples of deflationary industries in society that thrive.
I think it's time we open our minds and accept that the times have changed and we can route around volitility in the digital age with ease. The entire reason such dogma exists is because those economists are stuck on the concept of gold coins and Fiat.
If we are talking about digital fungible money, then seriously why would that matter anymore? 
This is and the assumption is that *most* people have used it. When you need to pay, your seller tells you the amount and you send it. No dividing or counting of money needed. Old reasons no longer apply.....

Protection on our funny money is better than no protection on our funny money. You deal with the problems you have with the current constraints you have.
The problem with everyone who argues from your perspective is you think life exists in a vacuum where all these conditions dont exist. They do, and you need to acknowledge reality and realize that we must work with the constraints we have.
USD is not going anywhere. You can make a fool of yourself to speculate it is going away, but that wont change reality. Its here to stay for at least our lifetimes, so speculating on the unrealistic is a pointless endeavor.
So since its here to stay, since its embedded in our global society, then we must acknowledge the benefits that FDIC brings to citizens.


Sorry, in not a libertarian nor am I crazy. I don't think we should neglect our eldery because they got fucked over by the market and lost their savings. Yes, people need to take a direct responsibility in saving so they can support themselves, but when shit happens the whole "throw them to the wolves" libertarian perspective is not the right way to treat society.
Social security is paid into dude. You get points on every single tax return you file and when you accrue enough points (I think its 40 points?) you get SS benefits when you retire. And if you don't pay enough into it, you **dont get SS**. Its a pension fund. You can pretend that its not, and that its some conspiracy theory, but I'll just consider your opinions deranged.


Dont' be a fucking idiot. How's that for "productive argument" ? Anyone who would argue against nationalizing our parks **is a fucking idiot**. Yea, lets go ahead and sell our most treasured fucking land that has needed eons to become what it is for short term profits to private entities.
Dude. This is why I downvote you and usually ignore you. You are a little shit stain that wants to argue that water isnt wet regardless of how *soaked* you are.


Where we disagree is our perception of reality. You seem to hold some fantasy land ideals where society would be "better" if we just fucked everyone over.
I **know for a fact** that society operates better when we take care of its constituents. You know how I know? *Because there is actual real data that proves societies function better when they have health care, education and social services*.
Not only is it true, **but its the goddamn right thing to do**.

No, there's just ignorant little shits like you who are such low intelligence beings that they cannot extrapolate the complicated nuances.
Bitcoin was created to allow citizens to opt-in to a new form of money that is free from central control. No where in the whitepaper or in any of satoshi's writings did he take a stance on taxation, regulation or government. Therefore bitcoin could have not been created to influence taxation, regulation or government, except in the context of the issuance of money, and even then bitcoin does not effect a states control to issue money, merely allows its citizens to opt into a new citizen-driven form of money.
You could prove me wrong by providing me quotes from the whitepaper and satoshi on these subjects, but as im someone who has read every single satoshi quote I can tell you with good faith that he has not engaged in these subjects, and probably for a reason.
Money being free from central control does not eliminate the need for societies to fix roads, pay fireman, build plumbing, provide healthcare, or any other such fundamental aspects of a civilized society.
Its just little turds like you who think that bitcoin is some crypto-anarchist circlejerk fest where you can tell everyone to fuck off, take out your guns, start waiving them around as if you own the world and you can now do whatever the fuck you want.

Your post was very good right up until this point. Why would you dare suggest that *anyone* should be *changing* to a fork of bitcoin?
That is as anti-bitcoin as it gets. Are you single handedly trying to destroy bitcoin?
The greater argument does not matter. Whether a fee market develops or not based on artificial restriction due to apathy from developers does not matter in the long run, because one of the blocksize BIP's *will* get implemented, worse case scenario is gavin's 8mb BIP.
That means that whatever fee market develops in the interim will be destroyed once blocks open up.

Yup, we've had this [in california for a while]( It gets pretty expensive. I've often though about this in relation to btc as well, the tradeoffs that occur in society to maximize efficiency of things.
But im always kinda bitter about the fastrak. Because in some area's they literally removed the HOV lanes that were free and public, and forced you to pay for fastrak if you wanted to use those special lanes.
Frustrating when we the taxpayers were the ones that built the roads in the first place. Why our government wouldn't just run the fastrak itself and then use the fee's it earns to build more transit systems is beyond me. No, instead they sell it to a private company for billions, and then that company rapes us dry every day in transit fee's if we are rich enough to use it.

These problems are solved with open source, transparency and community consensus on the correct path forward. Im not saying its likely anytime soon, but that is the path.


Economists around the world would disagree with you. There is no such thing. Every market exists inside a regulatory state. The closest thing we have is some indigeny communities with no outside contact engaging in trade amongst themselves. Trade amongst the Inuit would be a good example. But pretty much everything else? Regulated either by state, or results skewed due to consolidation of power (e.g. monopolies, cornering market, etc).


We already have the answers to these problems. The problem is implementing the solution. Equality is increased through wealth redistribution and good regulation that enforces public subsidy. Power consolidates, from every level, from the molecular all the way up to universe galaxy sized black holes. Humans and our networks are no different and this has been demonstrated ad infinitum. So without societally based redistribution the laws of the universe will always dictate a consolidation of power.
Convincing those ruling elites of society to redistribute their own wealth is the problem. We cannot expect the rich to engage in alturistic behavior. We've seen 10's of thousands of examples in which the rich will do everything possible to hide their wealth to prevent redistribution. Only very few rich people (gates foundation, the gates pledge, etc) believe in redistribution of wealth from their personal coffers. A tragedy of the commons dictates that for however many altruistic billionaires there are, 95% of the rest will not engage in those public beneficial actions.


These are good thoughts. I like them. However I see AI and machine learning and the granting of executive powers to machines as a way for us to enforce rules upon ourselves that we are seemingly unwilling to impose upon ourselves. We must elect those who are willing to make the hard decisions, and I think in the future these will be AI's. Its these AI's that we need to get in charge of modeling outcomes of regulatory action, wealth redistribution, UBI, etc, and then extrapolating statistical likelihood of those outcomes with variances, then creating proposals to maximize public benefit.
The issue is always the same - Political. How do we make choices for society that benefits the majority, but infringes upon the minorities rights? Wealth redistribution could be perceived as an attack on a minority group, since the ultra rich are a small subet of the population. How do we dance around the constitution for the best of society?
So this ultimately becomes a rabbit hole discussion of liberty vs security. do we sacrifice liberty for financial security, e.g. wellbeing? Or will AI figure a way to route around these problems, making non-liberty sacrificing choices while maximizing public benefit? This would be a less efficient manner to handle it, but perhaps the best we will get in a society of humans and constitutions.

"If you see fraud and do not say fraud, you are a fraud."
- Nassim Taleb
I believe and practice this philosophy in my life. It can create friction at times but I see it as a responsibility of *all* of society to behave this way in order to root out malfeasence.
All exchanges should practice this. This is good self-regulation. Fuck the market, the market is filled with morons who buy/endorse/scam shitcoins. If we *know* beyond a reasonable doubt that something *absolutely is* a scam, then it is our responsibility as a society to self-regulate.

I confronted Voorhees several times asking him why these companies that claimed this overwhelming consensus didn't prove it by actually polling their users. 
Every single one of those custodial wallets could have signaled their preference had the platform operator implemented a signing mechanism that would allow them to prove where they stand and how much Holdings they stand with.
I think it's pretty obvious why they didn't do any of this sybil resistant polling. They knew that it would only confirm what they suspected in private but we're unwilling share in Public which is to say that they didn't have the overwhelming consensus that they lied about.
They were magicians with shity obvious magic tricks and they were afraid to practice in front of us because they knew that we would see how obvious their tricks were and that they would be exposed.

From what I recall there was someone who had gained access to gmx accounts or someone had spent a reasonable amount of time guessing the birth date specified on satoshi's gmx account. It had apparently allowed you to retry in a reasonable amount of time, making the guesses over a long period of time possible to unlock the account. I cannot remember a lot of specifics, but I remember the gist that it was just random hackers who took over the account.

Its important to remember that the key measurements for bitcoins success is not the price index, but the infrastructure being created. It is being created, but a lot of work is not going into creating centralized services like coinbase, circle etc....but instead by creating p2p decentralized models that allow citizens to bypass the traditional legacy systems.
Every time we cut out the middle men, we enable society to become more profitable at a citizen level. THIS is the type of economic activity that creates healthy economies. Not major corporations flexing their money muscles, cornering the market, creating monopolies and exploiting the public for cheap labor to maximize profits at the expensive of society.

@_date: 2017-11-09 22:26:21


Ok. So since you are trying to weasel out of deomonstrating basic intellectual honesty, let me correct you on your assumption here.
YOU made the claim that free markets exist, not me. Im telling you that they dont exist, and the burden of proof to prove free markets exist is upon you.
As for your "weed market" "not being regulated" ....not being regulated is not equal to "free market". A market can be unregulated and also not a "free market".
I've tried to explain this several times but I think your not getting it. Power consolidates and centric forces will always dominate any unregulated market. This doesn't make it free, it makes it subject to laws of nature that exist regardless of your opinion on the matter.
When you have a monopoly, is a market "free" ? A unregulated market with a monopolistic entity cornering the market with its excess capital/power/etc does not make the market "free"...it makes it just as manipulated as if greenspan had his finger on the scale from a legislative POV.


That definition is fine by me....check the bold...


When a monopoly within the market exists, it is not free, as per the definition you just gave me. It has nothing to do with existing in a vaccuum without consequences, it has to do with a stable, equalized market in which monopolistic forces do not exist.
And I will state it again - None of these markets exist in our society. These free markets do exist in small niche examples, such as the one I already gave, trading amongst the Inuit population north of the treeline in North America. Show me a market that does not have monopolistic entities in it and I'll nitpick through the details with you to see whether it has any truth to it. But I honestly cant think of many examples. And definitely nothing large scale. And if its nothing large scale, then this whole conversation is moot....you should just accept there is no such thing as a large scale free market in our world and we can be done with the conversation.
But if you are going to try to tell me that your weed market doesn't have monopolistic forces, im going to have to let you know that your weed market is constantly engaged in price setting behaviors that has nothing to do with free market competition, and is constantly influenced by large players, making it not a free market.
This applies to both the black market and the regulated weed market. I live in california, im not ignorant to these facts. We live breathe and sleep cannabis here in cali.
I think you want to nitpick the semantics here. Im just being blunt. The market as you describe does not exist. You made the claim it exists, not me, so its up to you to prove it.


No, you didn't get me. I was saying that since our societies are dominated by non-free markets, if a indigenous tribes free market was interfered with by any external force, then it would no longer be free. ONLY in these rare tribal markets do we see true free markets. If any external forces influence these markets, they are no longer free.
I get what your saying, but im trying to give you real life examples here, not bullshit theory. I dont care about your theory, I care about reality and facts.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:40:38
I think you're missing the point. The point is that if you are incapable of a properly scaling your centralized system in which only you control then how can you have any hope at scaling a decentralized Global Network which is vastly out of your control.
No one is saying that scaling a centralized server at this volume is easy. But it is Leaps and Bounds easier than scaling a non centralized system.
This is similar to politicians raging the War on Drugs when we cannot even control drugs inside our own prisons.
It's highly hypocritical and stupid to boot.

This is the nice thing about Piketty, he uses *data*, not just theory, to backup his claims. That was the entire point of the book, that he *proved* societies function better with socialistic programs and regulation with socioeconomic data going back to the 1600's.
Listen, you are out of your element. You are just pulling a dunning-kruger if you are going to try to dismiss his empirical findings.

An investigative report is intended to simply provide investigation details. They don't "explain things" because that would go against the purpose of the investigation in the first place.
It's not meant to come to conclusions. it's meant to provide as much information as possible to allow a separate body of authority to take that information and then to make its own conclusions.
And also had a pretty narrow purpose. it was rich and detailed in information that was relevant to the scope of the investigation. expecting rich and relevant detail for things are outside the scope is a irrational expectation. Also you cannot know what is redacted and it's probably pretty damn important for the bigger picture.

Well you may be correct that we don't need permission to use cryptocurrencies the article is correct in insinuating that with regulatory structure that it will allow for more investment from the business side.
More infrastructure is essential to global adoption. if you or anyone else thinks Bitcoin is ready for the world stage prime time yet then you have not thought through the technology very clearly. It's just not ready. I hope that in five years time or less that it will be ready but right now it's not so all of the regulatory discussion and discussion of investment and infrastructure is definitely appropriate.
What you, I and others rationally fear is governments creating over restrictive regulation whose purpose is more beneficial to authoritarian regimes looking to spy on the finances of its citizens versus protecting.
regulation that does not have a net positive benefit to the public should not be on the table for consideration.

I don't think you understand the scope of the problem. You are assuming a fair market place where our society based voting systems are secure and fair. I assure you, they are not. Have you not read about how cheap it is to influence visibility on Reddit? Bots can be automated and with cheap ease.
You are sorely mistaken if you think we can have meaningful discussion without moderation. This isn't an academic forum. It's a anonymous public forum where  there are not restrictions in place other than what we choose to moderate. That means whatever can be done, *will be done*.
If we had real societal identity based reputations, the environment would be less toxic. You see much better behavior from those people with reputations on the line.
Your model works if there are real identities. It does not when there is pseudonymity.

The analogy that was always given to explain this was to say that Bitcoin mining is similar to gold mining in that the manufacturers of shovels ended up making more money than the gold miners did mining gold.
Considering the cost of bitcoin miners this may be quite true. But looking back at the price of Bitcoin in the early days versus the price of Bitcoin now yes they could have ended up making a lot more money by cornering the market and mining but that would have been against the spirit of decentralisation and threatened the security and stability of the network by making a 51% attack I reality so it's a double-edged sword.

Bro, I can't dump my Tesla stock. Do you have any idea how much its going to be worth in 5 years?
In all seriousness, if you are trading labor or fiat for bitcoin, and you appreciate gains between the conversion and that moment, thats *free money*. You should be even more encouraged to spend your free money.
I don't really get the whole "deflationary currencies will send the economy into a death spiral" fallacy.
When you need a new computer, do you wait 6-12 months for the latest tech, or do you buy it now? You buy it *when you need it* the same way you will *spend your bitcoin when you need to*.
And if not spending it encourages fiscal responsibility? Good. We need that.
Theres a false dichotomy of assuming that everyone will just hold their bitcoin. The problem we have today is that people are fucking debt slaves and spend more money then they have. Encouraging a small percentage of the population to *actually be fiscally responsible* would probably have a net beneficial effect upon society. Lets be honest - The habits of over spending is entrenched upon society. Good fucking luck changing that from a macro perspective, and having that effect change the *majority* of the populations spending habits.
Its not going to cause a collapse because 2% of the economy decided to not buy bitches some drinks at the bar because they don't want to spend their crypto.
But that 2% ? They are going to buy *a fucking house* or *start a goddamn business* with that capital that they accrued from their fiscal responsibility.
The assumption that everyone is just going to hoard their digital gold forever is absurd. This is such a scare tactic by old school economists and statists. They **want** you to be debt slaves forever, stuck in a closed loop society of nothing but debt and slavery.
How about you break free from that vicious cycle, start actually practicing fiscal responsibility, and then contribute back to society in a meaningful way once you've reached your goals?
This is one of the many reasons bitcoin is good for society. It encourages people to be fiscally responsible, to break away from the vicious debt slavery cycle and has the added benefit of being *good money* that allows you to exit from centrally controlled *bad money* that is incumbent upon all.

Technical discussion needs context and extrapolation, which cannot be achieved on twitter. The only reason people use twitter is because other people use twitter. Other than that, it sucks. Its like a shitty diner that everyone goes to because all the good places are closed for the day.
Reddit upvotes content more often that is larger, than smaller. This is because redditors value information over compactfulness. This is why reddit is a superior platform, and why we should seek to use reddit as the main communication platform instead of pandering to tweeters.

First, let me say I think this is awesome and it looks tits. But I am concerned about the paypal trading option. As im sure you know its a bed of snakes with excessive abuse on fraudulent accounts.
How do you plan on combating the enormous amounts of chargebacks that are going to occur with traders who sell btc for paypal? 
Seems to me this will just become a fraud haven for carders to dump their ill gotten gains for btc. Obviously this is going to happen to any exchange that opens the doors to paypal, so im not singling you out, just curious to hear your thoughts on the issue.
After watching the demo, it appears that you are deriving a multisig key pair through a password entered by the user yes? Isn't the site then holding the private key's for both buyer/seller? Wouldn't this imply that the site could be compromised and the keys/btc taken? 
This does not appear to past the "no central custodian" test since you still appear to be storing the private keys for the escrow on your site. Seems to me that you would need to have some sort of in-local-browser javascript multisig key generation + redeem script that the user would need to document on his computer to release the escrow, in order for your exchange to be non-custodian. I understand this adds complexity to the user experience, but it appears to be the only way to keep the private keys off your exchange.
So while your exchange may not technically "hold bitcoins" its holding the keys to those bitcoins which is the same thing as far as customers and hackers are concerned. 
Edit - I've just seen your [response]( below and it appears you've satisfied some of my concerns. So you are only storing a encrypted container of the keys, and only the users password can unlock said container? And that password is only entered in the local browser and never uploaded to the server?
Source code is really needed to be public for this sort of thing to build trust.

Yea, try going around in real life calling people ignorant and tell me they dont respond as a personal attack.
You clearly lack basic social interaction skills and/or etiquette to understand what everyone else does. Sitting behind your computer typing out the scenario as if it has no context or emotional bearing shows how out of touch to society you are.
As I said, you are discussing semantics.  There's just no point because you seem incapable of understanding black is black. I cannot explain to a sociopath how feelings work because he has no basis. This is how I feel about anyone who cannot understand such a simple concept.

So how much BTC value was locked into this Dorian card when it was issued? And the qty issued?
Seems like these things are almost as valuable as casascius  coins.
If I'm understanding this correctly in order for someone to participate this simply just need to design one of these cards and then lock in some counterparty token value to it? Then spin it off to the community and see if there's anyone that wants to buy it?
What are typically the marginal offerings for these cards? Like as in how much value do people lock in and then how much do they immediately try to resell it for? And how many cards daily or monthly are created  and what is the demand and Supply like? 
Honestly I thought this whole thing was a joke I didn't even realize it was a legit industry, and as silly as it seems I don't think anyone could deny that at this point and has some pretty serious speculative value.

I agree with most of your comment, but I would like to point out that the exchanges and payment processors are *not* the "economic majority". Please dont confuse people.
The "economic majority" is comprised *of the users* since the term  "user" means "bitcoin holder". Whether they actually use it or hold it is irrelevant, owning bitcoin automatically makes you a user. This means a ton of miners, VC's, ETF hodlrs *and* developers. Its not as black and white as you make it, and certainly not as inaccurate as that.
And yes, users *absolutely steer the ship*. If you think the users dont have power then please keep your apathy and ignorance to yourself and stop trying to confuse the real users otherwise.

I've been in the btc world for years and only have just recently learned how much fraud there is with paypal. Im sure there are plenty of other people like me who dont know how much of a fraud pool paypal is, and would be subject to losses.
I think the responsible thing to do as a exchange operator who is allowing paypal transactions is to provide fair warnings to every person who attempts to use the paypal option. A warning screen when paypal option is selected with advice on paypal fraud, appropriate times to wait before funds can clear, and a confirmation box to acknowledge information etc.
Just expecting people to know is not good enough. They wont, and people will regularly get ripped off.

He's saying the sleezy part is the social FUD surrounding blockspace/mempool while they are exploiting a PoW circumstance to gain competitive edge by mining empty blocks.
No, its not "wrong" to optimize. What is wrong is monopolizing the ASIC industry, then mining empty blocks while complaining blocks are full.
Are you really going to try to argue that the person who makes 75% of the ASIC's in the world needs **more** competitive edge?
Mining centralization is the biggest threat to bitcoin. It always has been, and probably always will be. If you are going to sit here and claim this is not a problem, you **will** be mocked for it.
There is no room for delusional thinking in this regard. This is an incredibly serious threat to bitcoin and we dont need shitposters insinuating otherwise.

Correct, in the end its the *users* who get to decide the fate of bitcoin.
Saying that miners control bitcoin is like saying that the baseball glove is the tool that decides how a particular baseball player plays the game. The glove is just a tool that allows for the game to occur within the intention of the agreed upon rules of that game, but it is the human holding the glove that gets to decide where the ball is thrown, not, as some people would think, the tool.

The bottleneck isn't storage space. Its RAM.
At 32MB blocksize you wouldn't even be able to handle a single large town's cryptocurrency usage if it became mainstream. A large city would require something of the order of 1.6GB blocksizes to handle all of its citizens usage if bitcoin replaced VISA. We will see the elimination of up to 50% of nodes with even conservative increases of blocksizes. 8MB blocksizes would eliminate 90-95% of current nodes, according to the same paper above. But im sure it would totally still be valuable when its centralized and non-censorship-resistant riiiiiite?

The key term here is "controversial". You are using that term loosely. Who is it controversial to? 
If its not controversial to the users and the economy, then the UASF is guaranteed to succeed. There is of course no guarantee that there wont be a chain split and a limited amount of chaos because of miners who wish to mine irrationally against their own economic interests.

Despite the fact that this system creates undeniable risks of multiple forks occurring? 


No, of course there is not. But thats not what you are suggesting. You are suggesting node operators to change *consensus* rules, something to which bitcoin was not designed for. Even satoshi said that non-compatible clients would "wreak havoc" on the system. What do you think "non-compatible" clients are if not clients that change consensus rules? Thats what "non-compatible" means in this context.


Only to someone who is engaging in a false dichotomy and ignoring all the evidence so that the narrative fits their opinion.
You are crazy dude. This AD/EB configuration idea is garbage to anyone who understands bitcoin and can spend 10 minutes analyzing the risks.
Every single change to the system is a engineering tradeoff. You measure cost and then you measure benefit and you make a educated decision based on the measurements of both.
You are stipulating that in order to satisfy a ideological question "Who gets to determine consensus" you are willing to sacrifice the health of the entire network to the point of its destruction.
Yea, sorry, thats not a valid tradeoff.

I think its a fair statement to say that there have been attacks from all sides, from all angles.
What said was pretty accurate. Greg has not handled himself very well, and has resorted to assumptions, stretches of logic and overly emotional displays and outright attacks. I've witnessed it firsthand and even he has made erroneous assumptions about myself, to my despair.
I've seen little to zero from both Jeff and Gavin. Both have displayed *exactly* the kind of mettle we need when it comes to communicating with both the public *and* with other developers. All developers have had a real rough environment this past year, but some have handled themselves like gentlemen the entire time, and others have gone a little crazy on us at times. Most commonly I would say greg and luke jr. Even adam back has gotten a little emotional here, though he is in general a pretty sophisticated communicator.
Is it really so far fetched to understand that a mind as brilliant as greg's will have difficulties with social situations? Do you have no understanding of the most prestigious schools having the highest number of students with social problems? Take a visit to MIT sometime and you'll see the overwhelming amount of support resources that are needed to help the students there. Like 5x what usual universities have.
Greg deserves enormous respect for his contributions, but be careful in putting him on a pedestal like that. He's not god and he's a infallible human who makes mistakes, like most others.

I think thats a good point, but it does not really alleviate the risks I have put forth. If this is to be a major layer addition to bitcoin, then the benefits should outweigh the risks, and not vice versa.
If there is reasonable threat that the standardized model has potentially large security concerns, it should be discussed and the public should be made aware.
My fear is that if there is critical vulnerabilities, that large amount of funds could be taken from hubs. Please understand that my concern is not about whether LN will be a solution, but about whether LN will suffer a major attack that will cause havoc on the system. If you cause enough widespread panic/doubt, then it could lead to major setbacks by speculative attacks on bitcoins value, and decreased usage on LN. While you have provided a excellent response to alleviate fear that *my* funds would not be stolen, you still have not addressed the core issue of *funds being stolen*.
It seems that we would need to deviate from what I feel is currently a mostly cold-wallet user experience, with professional platforms like exchanges and web-based wallets with advanced security mechanisms (I like blockchain.info's in-browser local security model) handling the the transactions, with only a small amount of users that are running "hot" wallets on their computers. 
I think its safe to say running a hot wallet on a consumer machine is insanity and asking to have your funds stolen.
What we would deviate into is a new model where we constantly have large amounts of "hot" wallets, all over the world, called LN hubs, which would mean that the risk is distributed from these very large scale professional companies with security teams and risk-averse planning and methodology, to consumers with very low security education.
Is *this* the tradeoff? Are we trading one type of security (central entities that handle broadcast load), to a new type of security? Or do you feel that I am incorrect in my assessment of the current playing field? 
I would like to think of bitcoin as a decentralized usage system, but looking at users, it seems that most of them use places like circle, coinbase, blockchain.info, coinkite.....and only a minority uses software like core, mycelium, etc. It seems that most people rely on centralized service providers who are good at mitigating risk, so that the users dont have to absorb that risk.
@_date: 2016-02-04 22:01:27
I see all these polls arguing over classic vs core, and it entirely misses the point. This is *not* about classic vs core, it is about keeping bitcoin as a free market vs keeping a artificial cap that will lead to a constrained market with artificial monetary policy.
The argument should not be about classic vs core, but about whether the network would support core if it adopted a 2mb HF upgrade with segwit.
We will start to hit full blocks over the next few months. Then SW will be deployed, and we will see some *short term* relief. We are kicking the can down the road, and we will hit the same problem again later this year. Once we hit 1 block, fee pressure will artificially raise as transactions get stuck in mempool. This will have a domino effect which will lead to further transactions being deprioritized and left out of confirmations. Then, it will crash many of the existing memory-constrained nodes on the network, leading to a drop in decentralization. Yet they are not talking about this are they? I happen to be a node operator and this *will* happen when blocks start getting full!
The argument, repeated by core developers, is that there is "too much risk" involved in a Hard Fork, despite there being a number of times over the past 1.5 years where we have had &gt;90% consensus on the upgrade. Yes, I know that these issues swing back and forth when politics get involved, *especially* when it comes to "classic" and other alternative implementations interfering with the debate.
Do *not* let alternative implementations muck up the issue! This is about not constraining the free market and allowing it to determine its own equilibrium. 
Lets show core that their fears are unfounded. That consensus *can* be reached. I know that if it came down to it, that the majority of the network, under most circumstances, is going to support core. No one wants to *risk a network split*
But the argument that there will be a network split if core proposes a HF is not backed by any credible evidence. 
Do *not* be confused into thinking this is a debate about decentralization. I am extremely pro-decentralization as it is the most valuable asset of bitcoin. But that *does not* mean that a 2mb upgrade would effect the node count in any way. The network *wants* this upgrade and it will show it when the time to test comes. But since we are not seers or sooth sayers, let us put our votes ahead of time to show them the confidence they need to make educated decisions instead of bolstering unfounded fears!

This is how narrow your vision is. "BU has theirs" is like saying "some kid on the playground". No one cares about BU. Other than the Mining cartel that is funding it to pursue their asic optimizations.
The gig is up guy. You can't pretend you dont know the facts now. This "support" for the "alternative path" is not support at all, its more of the same centric forces attempting to monopolize control over this industry.
Bitcoin is working great. Everyday that we continue resisting forces like Jihan and Friends ™ proves how fucking awesome bitcoin is. While shills, sock puppets and deluded non-thinkers like yourself continue to shitpost.
Bitcoin would have already progressed forward if not for a mining cartel who had a 100 million dollar a year reason to see that progress forward halted by running a misinformation propaganda campaign that people like you are stupid enough to believe in.

This is actually a pretty valid question. I think the elephant in the room is that a large part of bitcoins economic activity is for illicit uses on DNM's.
I think the best way to handle this is for the legal businesses to come together as an economic majority to influence the DNM's to follow suite.
DNM's are susceptible to reorgs and coin losses just like every other business so once the majority of exchanges and wallet providers by volume are on board, then the risk is against anyone who is not on board.

I dont think they are misguided at all. I think they are economically guided towards the direction that best benefits them.
nullc has demonstrated that Jihan is merely serving his own best economic interests by stalling progress to milk his covert asicboost as long as possible.
Roger is heavily invested into alts like ETH and Dash, and no one denies this as he is vocal about it.
How do we not know that Roger has liquidated extremely large holdings of BTC for alts? I think it would be irrational to assume that Roger has wealth beyond his btc, so how did he aquire his altcoin investments?
The only logical conclusion is by trading btc for them.
This provides a logically consistent path to explain why Roger is also acting within his best economic interests. The more turmoil there is with BTC, the more valuable all of these alts become as more people abandon btc and purchase various alts with their holdings.
Both of these individuals have become enemies of bitcoin, demonstrated quite amply with their own actions. Anyone who denies this is either lacking the facts, or critical thinking skills.

Miners absolutely can and have fucked over users plenty of times. Every single time a empty block is constructed miners are fucking over users. Every miner who is blocking progress for political, ideological, or anti-competitive reasons is fucking over users.
Users absolutely can fuck over (misbehaving)miners by deciding to change the rules to block anti-competitive behavior. PoW change is a primary example.

@_date: 2017-11-08 19:30:16
Ok. So it sounds like you are just engaging in semantics at this point to backstep an obviously illogical viewpoint. First, the premise of your argument is highly flawed. It assumes that bitcoin is a centrally designed network that can be attacked by a states legislators. This is a false premise to begin with, bitcoin is designed as a P2P network in which users, miners and participants can trustlessly participate *without permission from anyone.*


You are presuming network node vs mining node here, which is cherry picking a particular parameter to support your faulty logic. Let us instead strongman your scenario by supplanting *mining node* as the participant in this scenario.
Miners are absolutely a "participant" in the transaction itself because they *individually choose each transaction they include in their block*. You cannot deny this. There exists a scenario where a miner can opt to not include a tx, or opt to include it. This demonstrates the miner has direct influence of whether or not a participants transaction is relayed across the network in a confirmed block, directly making miners participants in transacting bitcoin.
So your entire argument falls apart once you accept this. Miners are no different than LN hub operators. They are still P2P participants in a decentralized global network. They can route around any firewalls obstructed by their nation states. 
In order for your argument to make sense, you would need to apply it to miners. However if you attempted to do so, it would just instantly fall apart for the reasons mentioned above.
Sorry, but you are a provocateur here who's sole purpose is obviously to spread misinformation and fear about LN. You obviously have ulterior motives for attacking the single most robust and technically secure method for scaling bitcoin. 


Why would we give two fucks what a regulator thinks about a decentralized censorship-resistant network? I think its pretty obvious who you are shilling for at this point, and it appears to be the united states government.
We don't pander to that statist garbage talk here.
@_date: 2017-04-24 18:03:24
Yes, but it still may be more economically rational for them to take the block reward and to leave the fee's on the plate. Right now its only 1-2 bitcoins worth of fee's per block, and if they could not have gotten that block without asicboost then it makes sense to keep using asicboost.

Only because you are uneducated on the topic along with 99.9% of everyone else who holds this view.


False dichotomy, witness data requires less resources so of course its going to be treated preferably. It fixes a long problem with bitcoins UTXO cost matrix. It always amazes me how stupid people are that they argue against positive enhancements.


Also false. [coindance]( shows 65 companies ready and 72 in support. So 95% of the industry has already migrated to support it. That means that we will see an immediate effect as soon as it activates. If fucking retards would stop blocking it from being activated we could prove this rather quickly, but instead we have to deal with idiots complaining about problems while blocking the solutions.


This one is also difficult to take you seriously on since its merely concern trolling. You do realize that satoshi himself advocated for softforks and we've had many which have gotten us where we are today?


No, people who have spent their lives pursuing a professional career and have the experience within this industry do. Not me, not you, not anyone else. They have reached consensus years ago on this issue.
None of these are rational arguments and they all lack basic comprehension of the system. They are not rational because they are not founded in knowledge. They are instead founded in assumptions and misinformation coupled with outright propaganda.
Sorry dude, but you dont know what you are talking about and you dont get to drag everyone down with your ignorance. Lets examine the facts -
Hard forks:
* The version message checksum change on Feb 20, 2012. This is sometimes not considered a real hard fork because old nodes could theoretically still connect to the network via a specially-designed proxy -- the format of the block chain wasn't actually changed.
* BIP 50. This is sometimes not considered a hard fork because the old behavior that was changed was non-deterministic.
* 
Soft forks that come to mind:
* Max block size &amp; max sigops per block
* Huge changes in Script (removal of many opcodes; changes in how Script is processed)
* Fix for the output overflow bug
* P2SH (BIP 16)
* BIP 34-BIP 66 (softfork in progress)
* 
There might have been more.
(Changes without BIPs were done by Satoshi.)
Clearly there is much more historical data to support the "clean upgrade" path softforks bring vs hard forks. Anyone who argues otherwise is literally crazy or just stupid.

You mean the "existing rule" that was *intentionally temporarily put there by satoshi* ? How easy it is to stick to that narrative but to forget that *very very important fact*.
If the measure was temporary, then obviously it was intended to be removed. So "sticking to the rules" in this situation would mean *removing the cap* NOT keeping it in place. 
This is not about semantics. There cannot be a misinterpretation on satoshi's intentions when they were as clear as they could be. It was a temporary measure. No one doubts the validity of that.
So persisting in repeating this argument for is doing a injustice to satoshi's intentions. 


Then we are in agreement. Thats my bigger point and thats all that matters. Everyone knows it, and very few doubt this, yet here we are discussing semantics when the wider issue is abundently clear - Core is stalling on upgrading the blocksize and is playing with fire. 
If the fire results in a artificial fee market, then core will get forked. 


No. Im calling a spade a spade. Thats *exactly* what it is. Alternative implementations *can* and *will* introduce incompatible features that result in a hard fork. That does not make them *not* alternative implementations. Look up the word "alternative" and then try to argue otherwise. Its a literal term and there is no misleading going on. Only you are assuming the context you are arguing against.
@_date: 2016-02-05 18:33:14
Well, we finally agree on something! Though I think you take it to the extreme. Gavin's approach was wrong. He was viewing bitcoin as a payment system and *not* as money, and if bitcoin is to be both a payment system *and* money, it needs to be fully decentralized.
Either way, he has compromised and learned a lot in the process. 
Also, gavin is basing his decision on more than a whim. The economics of block space come into play and there is no such thing as unlimited block size, because there is no such thing as unlimited transactions. Just because its opened up doesnt mean that tomorrow there will be 10gb blocks. It would be the same size as it would today, and tomorrow, and next month and the month after that.
The blocks dont fill unless there is need. People have to pay for space and blocksize helps determine the market price of fee's. 
@_date: 2016-02-20 21:43:28
Not sure. But I specifically remember no mention of nation-state usage. That would have stood out like a sore thumb.
I recall there being 3 levels of usage that they presented. The column to the far right was the "optimal" section and it had indicated 32mb blocksize.
LN will *not* remove the need for a blocksize increase. It will still need to happen regardless.
EDIT - I found the pdf but not the video. The video specifically mentioned 32mb being the best case use for LN. You can look at the # of users/usage in the pdf.

You dont see because you have little to no vision and have demonstrated this quite adequately over the past 6 months with your concern trolling and denialist behavior.
[read here for the explanation which I've given dozens of times and im sure you've read before](
Beyond that, once you start increasing bandwidth needs beyond the scope of anonymizing networks like TOR then you truly have left open the entire network to attack. 4mb results in 50GB of daily traffic. TOR cannot support the bitcoin network it is already over-burdened as it is. TOR suffers the same fate as bitcoin in that there are not enough participants running nodes for the network and can in no way be the shield bitcoin must hide behind if bitcoin becomes a unbounded resource.
Bitcoin is a broadcast system. You can go on bitnodes right now and compile a list of nodes and you can attack them all, and you can do it for relatively cheap considering the incredible botnet accessibility the public has now. You me or or you neighbor can spend less than a bitcoin and harness a network to selectively ddos a large majority of nodes on the network.
Why do you deny that water is wet? Why do you persist in ignoring basic attack vectors against the network? I can only assume that it is your ignorance of network security that you simply cannot grasp 1/100th of the danger of the system.

People want to send small amounts of money across the blockchain for free and are throwing temper tantrums because before bitcoin blew up they could do so.
They are now experiencing "growing pains" in that they cannot accept reality for what it is, and instead want to pout and shout until they get their way, not realizing that what they want has been waiting for them to be activated.

I would assume a person of this caliber already has plenty of offshore entities that control his funds. How would bitcoin help this?
Seems to me that once you already have your money off shore, its as "secure" as bitcoin is, in that your state cannot touch it. Of course, bitcoin is more secure as a trustless custodianless asset, but in the sense that in both situations the state cannot touch the funds is what matters in this example.
So how would bitcoin help with this? He already has banking and untold millions he's extorted or laundered. So it seems that bitcoin would be worthless in this, unless he is attempting to startup a new entity in another offshore in which he wishes to transfer the funds too without having a connection to the previous entity?
But, not really sure why if he's already secured the funds offshore. Thats the whole point of going offshore, because these zones have protectionist laws that enable this type of corrupt illicit activity.

Easy. You just watch a block explorer until the next block confirms. Did your transaction confirm? If not, how large was the block that just confirmed? If it was maxed out, then the only rational explanation is that you did not make it into the block due to space constraints. Surely the miners would take the extra revenue if they could as they are economically incentivized to take as much revenue as possible.
@_date: 2017-04-11 19:13:22


Not only simplier, but also more honest. Its ok to look at something in hindsight and say "Yea, maybe we handled this wrong". We couldn't know that we would have miners in the future that would signal/vote against the economic interests of the industry for their own mal-aligned economic interests. Trying to say now, after the fact, that its not a vote feels dishonest to me.
I see this more as a PR problem than a design problem, because we still *do* need miners to signal readiness. This is a multi-dimensional problem with intersectionality. We need all participants within the decentralized system to signal their willingness to upgrade on specific features so that we can organize to the best benefit of the network.
The better way to look at it, is that the voting system in reality is multi-dimensional. It requires all participants within the network to work together to reach a positive conclusion. This allows for better power balancing mechanisms to play out, to prevent collusion from specific sectors within the industry from strong arming control. It should not be *just* the miners who vote, but also the users, through industry platforms. We will vote with out wallets and make our intentions known socially to give input.
Its not a perfect system, but bitcoin by design is horribly inefficient. We cannot expect a inefficient system by design to have a miraculous efficient design for upgrades.

Yet thats not what is being proposed, is it? No one is shouting "50mb tomorrow!" are they? Everyone has compromised, fallen to reality, and now consensus is 2mb. Not 4. Not 8. Not 16 tomorrow...just 2.
So creating a false scenario that you can argue your point against is not a ethical way of debating a issue. The issue you are proposing there does not exist.


First, are you assuming that because a transaction is below $1 it is spam? If so, thats a rather over entitled position that has no place in our society. The blockchain was created for the world, not for the economic elite. Remember when micro-transactions was one of the big selling points of bitcoin? How it was going to revolutionize the advertisement/media industry? Yea how's all that going to happen with this fucked up elitest attitude that if its below $1 its 'spam' ?
You do not get to dictate what is spam or not. Miners do. Its a market, and that market works currently with free  market principals. Artificial roadblocks that change the economic terrain of the market is playing a economic policy dictator. Since when does economic dictator have any part in bitcoin development? What happened to free market principals?
As you can see, we are 80% full, *not* 60% full. We were 60%  full in November. Considering we have a very steady rise in one direction, it is save to assume that by may we will be 100% to capacity.
With SW only offering a 0.3mb bump short term with realistic adoption, that means we will have only until july-august until its full AGAIN, AGAIN creating artificial fee markets because core developers want to play economic dictator instead of developer.
Anytime we get near 100% there is artificial fee markets created. There are always going to be spikes of activity, so if we get near 90% there are going to be a LOT of blocks that do reach 100% which is going to cause mayhem for the average user who is trying to get his transaction through.
This whole playing economic policy dictator, PLUS trying to scramble at the very last moment to provide relief in a way that only kicks the can down the road a few months and puts us right back in the situation we are in is NOT what I want to see from a group of experts.
The proposal to do this was submitted almost a year and a half ago now. Yes, XT was extreme in one direction, but instead of compromise we got a parachute plan that only pushes the emergency slightly back.

No, it means exactly what it says. Just because you do not have the technical acumen to understand the statement does not make the statement nonsensical, it makes you ignorant to the facts. Keep in mind ignorance is not a insult, merely a state of being and one that can be changed with education, so do not take it as a insult.
That will help you understand the re-alignment of costs. Basically since RAM costs so much more than HD, we need to balance out the cost of each transactions impact upon the physical resources.
Right now regular outputs goes into UXTO, which bloats RAM usage, and with ram usage being the most expensive hardware cost, and HD the cheapest, we need to find out a better way to balance those costs since they are really out of sync with each other.
As the site says...


This construction reduces memory usage (awesome!)  and makes it so that we can construct larger more complex transactions without a compounded impact like it currently has.
Understanding bitcoin is not easy. Its not a simple system and understanding any aspect of the system is a challenge on its own. Especially challenging is understanding how all of the systems work together to create a network, and how the interplay between these systems have costs and benefits when changed.

No, it does not. It has a maximum potential of 3.7mb and you are falsely perpetuating this 2.1mb because you are stuck on thinking in black and whites and dont understand p2sh vs p2pkh.
You dont understand this technology enough and need to do *way way* more research to understand.
SW re-aligns the UTXO cost matrix and makes it more economically rational to use P2SH vs P2PKH, so this erroneous assumption that everyone would continue to use a more economically expensive method to transfer bitcoins shows that you are not thinking this through.
What you are falsely perpetuating is the blocksize that SW would generate today if SW flipped the switch and turned on *for just p2pkh* transactions.But anyone who understands the technology and the economic incentives/alignments understands that people are not going to use a old style transaction method if its going to cost them more.
You cannot complain about fee's being too high and then turn around and try to say that all of you are going to use the method that will cost you more fee's.
Thats fucking idiocy. 
The truth is neither you nor me knows how much blockspace SW is going to generate and we can only speculate on ranges. Its definitely not going to be 3.7 because that would only occur in theoretical best-case scenarios which dont exist. But once the system acclimates to the economically rational choices, then we will see a blocksize end up in the 2.5-3.0mb ranges (as my best guess).
Now please go bother someone else.

In the in security research, penetration testing, whitehat/blackhat world, there are hundreds of thousands, if not millions of devices monthly that are hacked/rooted. Calling such a standard and common procedure as "hollywood" only shows you are out of touch with the facts of reality.
Why would it be a big IF? LN hubs are decentralized and public. Anyone can be a payment hub. This means that the models of security will also be distributed, meaning that there will be many secure hubs and many insecure hubs, just as there is in real life all throughout computing devices around the world. Datacenters, governments, corporate financial systems....all these things get hacked, and get hacked *all the time*, why would you be so naive as to presume a LN hub wont suffer the same fate?


Yes, and if the system is automated, then that means the obtaining of signing by the trezor would *also have* to be automated in order for the hub to provide instant services. 
This means *not* a physical person being the personal firewall checking each transaction. That would be the only true "sanity check" that would be effective.
So if this is the case, and there seems to be no reason to presume otherwise, then the attacker getting root access to the device and telling the hub to make payments to a different address would have the system sign those transactions to that address the same way it would always sign them, since its automated.
I would be very interested to hear a developers position on creating algorithmic security mechanisms in regards to open/closed channels and creating fail safe logics for these types of attacks.

I've not seen any attacks by garzik on segwit. I've seen him debate the merits about using segwit as a scaling solution vs blocksize cap raise.
I think you are sensationalizing the issue. Which means that you yourself are being the same politician that you are now accusing garzik of being.
I expect that if you make these claims that you back them up. Otherwise, dont make them. Very unhealthy for the community, especially coming from someone as respected as you. We need to work together, not create more polarization.


*Really* ? I expect that kind of nonsense from some of the tinhatters here, but from you? Classic exists because core has stalled on the blocksize cap issue for so long, despite overwhelming support for it from the community. You have no one to blame but yourselves for not communicating a blocksize raise proposal sooner. And you *still* have not proposed one. There is no clear data showing that SW is going to be able to prevent a artifical fee market and you should not be playing economic policy dictator. You are a developer and you are not supposed to be dictating market decisions, you are supposed to allow the free market to determine the outcome when it comes to fee's.
Bitcoin as a experiment has failed if it is able to be dictated by politics. Creating economic tension that change the market through a artificial fee market is absolutely a example of this failure. Do not be a dictator. Let the market work the way it was intended.
And consider the fact that if you do play the dictator and interfere with the free market, that *you and the members of your team* will be the ones responsible for creating competition. Do not make that mistake. I am a supporter of core but if you play the dictator then I will happily support other clients to see that you do not destroy bitcoin with your politics.

That is the standard procedure for a canary. You guys absolutely CAN get a gag-order that has instructions that states you are not to blow the whistle. Since your canary is currently designed the way it is, it could be construed in court that by removing that statement you took action to notify the public. 
As opposed to simply not updating your site with a no-gag-order update, which is the opposite ...its inaction, not action. You can not be held liable for obstruction of a court issued order for inaction. But you can for an action.

I think that these servicers are filling a need within a particular market. We never expected bitcoin to remain the wild wild west while renting on mainstreet, and we knew that regulation and services like this would eventually pop up.
Also, this is nothing new. There are plenty of other coin analytic companies that already do exactly this type of blockchain monitoring for AML reasons. Coinbase said they check 4 hops, and you know they are not doing that in-house, they are hiring companies to do the work.
This allows for a better regulated bitcoin industry. This means more onboarding of banks, bridges, processors and the like. This is good for bitcoin.
There will always be the non-regulated side, because bitcoin *is the wild wild west* regardless of who thinks they can regulate it. You'll just have to choose whether you want to deal with a regulated entity, or pay a premium to deal with a sketchier non-regulated entity.
Always remember that bitcoin is a trojan horse. The more entrenched the financial system becomes upon this technology, the greater the impact bitcoin will have long term at dissolving the bonds of this highly corrupt financial industry.
SW and LN will happen, and they will happen in due time. The more entrenched bitcoin becomes, the greater the impact bitcoin will have when it has the ultimate fungibility mechanisms to ensure maximum sovereignty.
The biggest worry and threat is and always will be centralization.

This is only true on a technicality. It doesn't give more hashing power but what it does do is Forge the proof of that work so that the net outcome is a benefit.
Does it really matter if it doesn't give more hashing power but finds more blocks with the same or less amount of energy spent? The outcome is exactly the same as if you did have more hashing power, and it is done in a covert way that is very harmful to bitcoins ecosystems overall health.

To add on top of nullc's response, there actually is a workable valid solution similar to this scenario, but convincing the miners to adopt this solution is probably unworkable.
If miners want to increase the blocksize, they should accept a slightly higher difficulty for that next block. This gives miners a opportunity to earn additional fee revenue, but with a cost attached to it so that they are unwilling to shoulder additional resources upon the network willy-nilly.
This would prevent better-connected centralized factions from forcing larger blocksizes upon less-better-connected factions.

In what world does 25% outweigh 75% when it comes to decisions and consensus? Do the 75% just not exist in your thought process?
Do you know not a single blockstream employee has merge access? So nothing blockstream develops can get in Bitcoin unless it passes peer review. Not the peer review of the top ten, but of the entire project. Which makes it impossible for bad ideas to get pushed through.
On top of that block stream employees also are contractually obligated to put the Bitcoin blockchain first and in the event that a new board of investors or owner tries to force them to work against the best interest of Bitcoins they get a entire year's salary handed to them. Everyone always seems to forget that blockstream was founded by one of the people responsible for Bitcoins creation who was also a cyperpunk. Well I understand that every company seeks Investments so there will be corporate investments into their company, one cannot actually make the claim that any of the culture at blockstream is Corporate based. Cyperpunks dude. Do your homework.
I know you desperately want your conspiracy theories to be right, but the facts work against you. The problem is that you are unaware of the facts. If you were actually aware of all the facts then you would have course not have the conspiracy theory that you do have.

I think you are making assumptions and taking things out of context. They are not trying to price out users, they are trying to increase the *need* for scaling solutions like LN and building the base for security. Even though its merely semantics at this point, the way you phrase it has such a ill intent.
If one of the byproducts of this action means that some use cases are priced out, then by all means talk about it. But until that happens I think its meaningless subjective theory and toxic to assume things not clearly communicated.
Im sure you saw it. There's plenty of quotes for you about what is specifically wanted, and not once does it say "price out users".
You are right to question the economics behind all the decision making, but what seems apparent to me is that since core has decided that LN is going to be the best solution for scaling/decentralization/etc, they are doing their best to create the economic scenario that would best protect the security of the network.
You are right in that LN will sacrifice miner revenue, which is why core is trying to establish this fee market now, instead of later. 
This all makes sense when taken into context, and doesn't seem so nefarious. Its not like there's some collusion between core and miners where miners are paying core to get added benefits. No, they are merely trying to plan for what would be the most sustainable health profile for the network *with* LN in the picture.
You can say that you question this "LN all or none" attitude, but it seems pointless to question when its abundantly clear that core has been basing all of its actions on LN and no amount of objection is going to deter them. I think they are best qualified to make this decision in regards to the path forward.
Again, this coming from someone who identified as a "big blocker" not too long ago. I see the bigger picture now, and im ok with the direction we are going. If we cannot secure the network then all is lost.


Yes, which means at $300 a block we would need roughly 3.25 years before transaction volume hits $3,000 per MB, assuming the network continues to double every year and fee's remain the same.
We will continue to have a major subsidy of 12.5 btc for another 4.25 years, which seems plenty of time with LN existing to figure out the blockspace and miner revenue economics.
We can always adjust.


Yet you use that as a primary basis for your rational. You cannot use this as a valid rational if you cannot forecast where the volume will come from. You can either go off historical data and project future revenue, or you can make up fantasies and use them as speculative fuel.
Seems silly to say "We need to do X" but you dont know how to do "Y" when doing "Y" was fundamental to doing "X".
I know you mean well however.

There are several implementations of compatible clients. They all play together nicely. Its only when a client attempts incompatible consensus features that sand starts to get thrown around in the sandbox, and before you know it all hell is breaking loose.
I think the spirit of your post was really "how do we strike an efficient balance" between decentralization and efficient engineering decisions? Its a good discussion, but we shouldn't ignore the fact that humans naturally centralize socially. Its a part of our nature. So when one project shows the most promise, its within our psychology (and egos) to contribute or use that project.
I don't see this as a bad thing so long as there is a vigorous academic peer review process that attempts to eliminate bias through formal scientific methodology. 
That being said, I think its good to not be combative towards compatible implementations of clients, such as btcd.

This is a realistic viewpoint. If there are non-UASF miners more-so than UASF miners, then they can cause disruption of services to the network. This will most definitely piss off users and create a unfavorable scenario for a few weeks.
However, if the economic majority IS in support of UASF and is enforcing on their nodes, then even with a majority hashrate (which BU is only 3% more than SW hashrate atm) these majority hashrate miners will quickly find themselves in a dilemma. How long are they going to continue to attack the other chain if they cannot get paid for their work, or paid at a steep discount?
How long until they bankrupt themselves?
And how long can they hold the majority chain hashrate under these conditions?
Wouldn't common sense imply that those miners who are part of that majority anti-UASF chain will quickly abandon that chain once they realize their coins are not being accepted at exchanges?
So, we are back to the same exact scenario that shaolinfry stated from the get go -
If the economic majority does not integrate BIP148 then its not going to work. If they do, then it is almost surely to be successful, but the question is how long will the disruption last for?
My bet is on 1-2 weeks, to see how things shake out before the miners quickly abandon their losing position. Yes, it will suck for those 2 weeks.
But let us address the **real** issue here -
Do we really want a minority of miners to be in control of bitcoin forever? Do we want to allow them to stall the progress for monopolistic advantages?
Thats a horrible precedent to set for the long term health of bitcoin, and I for one will be more than happy to sacrifice bitcoins short term price for its long term sustenance. Especially if it bankrupts some of these poisonous players like Ver and Jihan.

Thats silly. I looked at your history and all I see is polite discourse with a lot of information, filled with mature replies. That is the reason you have more karma. Because you are the exact opposite of this not-so-fine gentleman.
Your 14588 comment karma divided by your months (35) comes out to 416.8 karma points per month.
My 9063 comment karma divided by my months (20) comes out to 453.15. 
So I would state that you were incorrect on your assessment of having more karma than me. You might have a higher number, but when you put us on equal ground by adjusting for your extra year of activity, I actually have roughly 10% more karma than you. Not that I think that makes me better, nor do I think it refutes your point, just wanted to show you that your math was a bit off :)
Also, I think that in your point, that you claim that you can earn karma without integrating is false. Not only have you clearly demonstrated that you are able to effectively communicate in various sub's, which shows a high emotional intelligence, but you must also take into account that in these mini-societies we create there will always be bandwagoning and echo-chambers. 
So if you pit yourself against the status quo you will surely be downvoted. Someone who wishes to accomplish a goal, by being anti-establishment/anti-status quo, must have exceptionally high emotional intelligence in order to accomplish his goal. He must be able to integrate into a society that is against his beliefs by using propaganda, or merely rational arguments phrased in a emotionally intelligent way to accomplish his goal. 
Resistance will come regardless, but the higher EQ the better you will sway others with your arguments. As we have seen in CIA manuals, doubt is the seed you need to sow, and if you can be effective in your communication you can convert people to your beliefs.

You do realize that you've added nothing to the conversation right? Why should we listen to you when you've only demonstrated you lack understanding of bitcoins economics?
What I just stated in my reply is what all of the experts within the bitcoin community have stated. I didn't just make it up. This was by design, by satoshi from the start.
Miners will follow the coin that gives them the greatest ROI.
If you dont like that then you shouldn't participate in bitcoin. If you dont understand it you should hit the books instead of shouting your ignorance to the world.

Yea, agreed. It seems to me that logically, these devices could not provide instantaneous automated services without the signing key being present within the memory of the OS.
Now, bitcoin nodes dont hold any money (well some do, but a lot of nodes dont utilize the wallet), so there's no incentive to attack a node.
But a LN hub seems to be a money pot sitting there. Couldn't you conceivably hack the hub, then redirect some payment channels to your own address? If so, then what would be the incentive to run a hub? Seems like the incentive would have to be sky high if your risking everyones money by being a payment service channel provider 
Or is there something im missing from understanding here?

The last time I looked at this issue the fee's that miners are paid are a pittance compared to the block reward subsidy. I think it would not be irrational to make the statement that it is the block reward, currently, and even after the halving that will continue to subsidize mining power.
And if that is not the case, then I would think that then core is actually making a rational and valid argument in that we need to establish a higher fee market. 
But, your point more specifically implies after 2-3 more halvings. Thats 8-12 years dude. Lets be realistic here for a second. Do you really think that LN should be pushed off for 8-12 years?
Seems like its going to be *the solution* for decentralization with micro-transaction capabilities, and with them building in onion routing / hornet protocol, they are going to add massive fungibility to the network.
And remember its the miners who decide what they will accept in terms of fee's. If the transactional market share is unburdened from the miners and put on LN, then that means that payment channel closes and other on-chain activities will need to result in higher fee's. A natural equilibrium will be found in the free market, as miners will fight amongst each other to determine what the fee's should be. This will be determined by their costs. If the subsidy is not enough, then they will not accept transactions without proportionally higher fee's. If other's do accept, then this means that there is wiggle room with their costs.
Frankly I dont really see it being a problem, and I've always been supportive of a blocksize raise from the very beginning. 


Old argument and irrelevant. The system will work through whatever issues it has and improve upon itself, or it will die and be replaced by something better. Let the free market work.


I agree with this statement. Which is why I support a small blocksize raise.

Yes, I found it kind of silly that he linked to his own comment in our thread about his authority in canary warrants, when my reply was upvoted and his downvoted.
Regardless, I understand reddit may not be the decider of all knowledge, but there is some common sense and logic at play here.
Here are a few issues that needs to address -
*Why* is it a bad/unsustainable idea? 
Using the logic that you "may forget your keys" is a illogical stance. Keys can be backed up with redundancy, and if you are a developer of software that will hold millions of dollars of peoples money, surely you can give a friend a usb/cd with your pgp private key to hold onto incase your ~~cat~~ dog decides to eat your pgp key?
But aside from that, lets discuss the legal aspect of it.
First, a court issued order comes with threat of violence. Thugs with guns and badges will come to your house, beat you down to the floor and throw you in a cold concrete and metal cell to rot if you disobey the order.
So let us evaluate the *possible* orders that could be issued,
- Court order to keep updating your canary warrant  
- Court order to gag/silence you from speaking out that you are under legal scrutiny, or worse, fully compromised by a legal authority who may be using your software as a honey pot.  
- Court order to provide your keys for your canary  
You *must* comply with all of these actions or face violence/jail. All three scenarios can be reconciled by having a 3rd party update your canary for you. You can create a login to your site (Maybe add ssl ...lol &lt;:/)for your canary pgp key wielding friend, who updates it for you through a anonymizer so that his security may not be threatened. You can also subscribe to a canary watch, which is devoted to this specific cause. You can also have said friend with key provide regular signed canary messages to the canary watch provider. 
Disclose this information, signed with your key, on your site, and disclose you are not in possession of the keys and have no way of stopping the canary updates. Since the court order is not for your friend your friend can legally update it on your behalf. The entire purpose of this is so that you are not ever in contempt of court for disobeying a court order.
You cannot give what you do not have and you cannot update what you cannot sign.
You and and anyone else can read this and see the logic in it. There is a reason these canary watch sites exist, and there is a reason you periodically update.
The common sense question of "How will I know if you are compromised if you do not provide updates" is valid. He cannot answer that question of course, because if you only create one message one time, then there is no way to know that you are not compromised.
The reason is obvious - If a court orders you to specifically *not* update your canary, you *have* to comply or you face threat of violence/jail. Now, im sure everyone sitting behind their keyboard thinks they are a libretarian badass that will scream in the face of the law as its kicking down your doors, but let me tell you that most people are pissing themselves when the thugs come knocking. 
And when the reality of jail is in your face, who can say whether you have the balls to defy a court order? Unlikely, if you ask me and im sure most will agree.

How is increasing on-chain transactions "pretty simple" ? If it were simple, then it would have been done.
You understand that core cannot create users out of thin air? This is a economic situation where increased on-chain transactions means that there either needs to be new users in the market, or users must stop using off-chain companies like circle, exchanges and other payment processors. In short, aint gonna happen.
I think its rather unrealistic to create expectations of a group of people who do not have that within their power.
You also failed to address the claim that Adam Back was representing core. I looked at all of the documents and statements and not once did I see such a thing. He's a major contributor to the  market, it seems rather normal for him to be in every single one of these meetings.

Meh, Everytime I hear these libertarian Utopia themes I always wonder how people can be so naive. You accept that the government, which is ran by citizens, is corrupt, yet you cannot envision how militias enforcement agencies and other private sector servicers will also be corrupted?
The dude is wrong in his first point and it's hilarious because his "solution" only encourages more of the real problem. The real problem is the same problem that we have in today's society everywhere in the world.....Collusion. These enforcement agencies won't hold back because of violence.....They will hold back because it's easier to just collude. A arbitration agency just created a even larger attack vector.
This video is essentially promoting government like agencies without a constitution and without law. It's just so dumb. Life is not a Utopia, humans will exploit vulnerabilities as often as they can and humans will be corrupted. Government is far from perfect, but a healthy democracy with a high participation rate is the best thing we have to safeguard against these vulnerabilities.
I know I will be downvoted for this because there are so many Roger Vet type idealists on this sub but whatever. Too many naive people with no game theory. Bitcoin is great because it's a real solution to sovereign money. Private agencies are not a solution to government, that path becomes instantly monopolistic.
Look what's happening with the EPA and FEC right now. This is what happens when you let private industry control society. You want that x1000? No thanks I will stick to corrupt governments.

You're a very smart guy and I cannot believe that you are *accidentally* ignoring the question at hand. Please stop trying to side step the issue to throw your propaganda at me. I do not need it.
The question at heart was *what is the best way to measure consensus*. Using mining power is currently the *only* way to measure consensus because all other social mechanisms are inherently flawed. 
Please stop avoiding the issue and just say "I dont know how". Its ok. We all dont. The smartest developers working in the bitcoin ecospace dont know how either.
But the last thing we need is for you to go off in a tangent and to try to confuse the issue by pushing forward your opinions on scaling as a substitution for measuring consensus. Thats downright manipulation of narrative and its not appropriate for the discussion.
I will say it again - Dont shit on other peoples idea's if you dont have solutions to offer *on the issue at hand*. 
Im happy to agree with you that SW, IBLT, weak blocks and any other optimizations are *great* things that need more work/research/optimization and should be pursued with full attention. 
As for how little I or anyone else understand bitcoin, sorry, but you can leave your opinions at the door, I dont need them. Use data, not emotion, to reference your argument.

They were asked to submit a  2MB HF proposal and luke ended up submitting a 32MB HF proposal with code as per the agreement.

What if *both* parties are correct? 
The world is not black and white and the discussion is inherently complex, not only from a technical nature, but also from a philosophical nature.
Trying to imply that people are incorrect in their assessments is a false narrative. Plenty of us are very intelligent people who have spent years studying the protocol and the economy surrounding it. Neglecting our opinion has lead to a polarized discussion. The result of that polarization is competition.
So far I've only seen a healthy response because of competition, in terms of *actual work*. You cannot progress without rigorous debate, so claims that anything that has happened is long-term toxic is unfounded. 
Bitcoin will prosper because of *both* implementations, as the open source model dictates. Anything worthy in classic will be put in core, and all things worthy in core will be put in classic.

Once we activate SW, then we can start to experiment with a working version of LN. How are we to use LN when it requires malleability protection to create working payment channels? This is akin to you asking to drive a car that has no wheels. The car works, everythings awesome, but unless we screw the wheels on it cannot operate.

Yet the company has a history of promoting takeover attempts of Bitcoin. Are we supposed to ignore their history and pretend that this was just another completely naive and innocent coincidence?
Let's also not be naive. Let's recognize that the CEO Brian Armstrong is a Notorious BIG blocker that is willing to burn down the bridge in order to pursue his personal ideology on what's best for Bitcoin.
But Brian Armstrong is not a cryptographer or a mathematician or even a programmer. We have no reason to listen to him we have no reason to follow his vision. He might be good with business but the whole point of Bitcoin is disintermediating Banks. Coinbase is simply the new version of a bank. Just because it deals in Bitcoin does not take away the fact that it is a centrally controlled and trust based business model.
So even though coinbase might be partly responsible for the run-up in price due to the easy onboarding of new users it is also a deal with the devil because at the same time they're hurting the ecosystem with their fanatical ideology and skewing the trustlessness of Bitcoins fundamental design.
I never recommend using coinbase.

Redditor with new account tells other redditors with many year experienced accounts participating in bitcoin sub "how bitcoin works"
Of course, the best lies are lies mixed with truth. The design implementation from the get go accounted for the even playing field regarding miners and PoW. We knew from the start that this would be gamed, hence all of the work put into ASIC-Resistant functions.
We knew from the start that this would be a cat and mouse game.
So is this troll account implying that we didn't already know that there would be efficiencies exploited for personal gain within the system?
I suppose this troll account must also then admit that the creation of ASIC's and mining pool must equally = "death of bitcoin" ...or at least if he wanted to stay consistent on his illogical message.
Typical false dichotomy where you cherry pick a narrative, focus on one element and ignore all else.
The system was designed for aligned economic incentives, yes. The system was *also* designed to be upgraded to prevent the gaming of the system that would skew the aligned economic incentives.

Its not my fault that you ignore the fact that users **have always been, and always will** be in control of bitcoin.
You seem to not understand this and I dont know how to make you understand.
Exchanges will do what users want because otherwise users will bankrupt them. If you dont believe me, why dont you go research how many businesses have gone out of business because they didn't listen to their userbase.


Good to know.


Not happening, so stop dreaming. This has been discussed ad infinitum for the past 3 years and you know why thats not going to happen.


Exchanges are a part of the community and depend upon users for guidance on how to operate their business. They are not crafting protocol changes, they are listening to the users.
If exchanges start blacklisting, then users will vote with their wallets and those exchanges will go bankrupt.
You also ignored the fact that LN allows for decentralized exchanges to exist in optimal form, so this is a null issue. You are basically saying "Exchanges are going to activate a rule that is going to give them less power, yet they are going to use that power against us!" while ignoring all of the interplay between decentralized exchanges, users, etc. Dont engage in false dichotomies.


SW + LN gets us there a shitload faster. So you should be advocating for that at all short term costs since that ensures your long term investment. I suppose you wanting a HF is a extreme version of that, so I will give you a pass on that one, even though its not going to happen.

@_date: 2017-04-10 02:14:15


Not a stupid question at all. There are no stupid questions, only stupid assumptions ;)
I explain it in detail [here]( -








Substantial reduction of node count decreases bitcoins security directly by reducing decentralization and making censorship more probable. Ironically, SW fixes this by re-aligning UTXO costs, so it actually kills multiple birds with one stone. Yet we are still fighting its activation despite all of the major positive benefits it has towards not only the security of the network, but the *progress* of the networks capabilities.
Detractors complain about the state of being, all while blocking the upgrade that resolves that state of being.
Its simply madness.
EDIT - 
Also need to add that quadratic hashing (cpu ddos attack vector), while fixed in SW, is not fixed for old-style transactions on legacy bitcoin addresses. So the reason SW increases the blocksize in the way it does is to allow for a blocksize upgrade without decreasing the security of the network by opening up quadratic hashing attack vectors. So if we were to do a SW + 2MB HF, then miners could construct a block that takes 12+ minutes to verify. This would ddos nodes off the network.

Yes, Greg did, and got called out for it on the devlist. It was poor form from him. He implied on the  IRC that Joesph Poon was implicated in this process.

How about we not try to protect your precious snowflake princess roger and instead recognize that he tried to take over bitcoin?
I cannot upvote this enough. I dont want to see this ass clown back with his dogshit non-technical ideological crusades in 6 months. He needs to be mocked and shamed to his core so that he hides with his tail between his legs for the rest of his life.
We dont want shitty people like this trying to strong arm bitcoin. The only way we can prevent that is by shaming them thoroughly for as long as possible for their behavior.

@_date: 2016-02-03 03:26:59


This whole mocking people because they want to see bitcoin grow and not be stagnated as a settlement layer is really a poor attitude.
I understand that people are hard at work creating layer2 services that will *eventually* bring micro transactions to fruition. But there has not been a single valid argument today by *any* core developer as to why a 2mb blocksize would create any negative impact on the network. And dont anyone dare try to spout this hardfork BS. The network has had consensus for a long time now and no where in that majority consensus is there any *fear* to be rattled about theoretical nonsense of network splits.
What we have seen, is core developers (gmaxwell) outright state that the intention is to create a fee market, which is the role of a economic adviser instead of a developer. Something gmaxwell has no right to dictate, being the excellent  and well deserved and respected cryptographer he is. 
As pressure is building the valve to release it is too slow in the coming and not fast enough. A few developers were fighting *hard* for a bump over a year ago, while the rest stagnated. While I dont agree with raising the limit more than a 1 or 2mb, I still think they had the right vision and perspective, that the limit needed to be raised 6 months ago, not 6 months - 12 months from now.
But at the end of it, your attitude sucks and you should not mock bitcoiners for having philosophical differences than you. We all want to see bitcoin succeed and this building of walls is toxic to our environment.

Because bitcoin is sovereign money and so long as it remains decentralized it will resist state *monetary control*. This mostly has to do with printing money, inflation, etc.
It is not a conflict to believe in bitcoin and also believe in taxation. Taxation is essential for civilized societies to exist.
Thomas Piketty has already proven that taxation and *healthy* regulation who's purpose is public benefit leads to the most healthy economies. Its corrupt politicians pandering to specialized industries, monopolizing industries and creating bad regulations/laws that favor these special interest groups that fuck society. I encourage you to read the book, he's an economist that worked for over a decade with big data scientists to gather empircal data to back up his proposals. There's a difference been economic theory and economic reality, Piketty engages in the reality part.

They are ideologically driven on different developmental management principles. I don't see any monetary conflict here, they are just wrong. Gavin seems to not care one whit about decentralization, so why he would be involved in a decentralized project is beyond me.

Yes. I am absolutely frustrated by your idiocy.


This is not the case with bitcoin, which is a open source project that is contributed to by hundreds of developers around the world. In the case of bitcoin yes, my analogy was correct. The scientists and engineers *acted on their own* without needing to be hired from a train company. Your interpretation of the analogy is incorrect because you seem to not understand the nature of a decentralized open source project.
And these engineers continue to act on their own to maintain and upgrade the system because their purpose is to make the system better, not to pander to a board of investors (miners). The end users, the holders, these are the people that developers "pander" to, which is exactly how it should be.
And before you spout your Blockstream garbage at me, they only employ a few developers and are contractually obligated to put bitcoins best interests first and are even protected by a clause that stipulates that if a new owner demands they work in ways against bitcoins best interest that they will get a paid 1 year severance salary.
I would trust a few people hired by Adam Back, a cyperpunk, anyday over some children on the internet who write buggy code.

I never took a moral position on regulation. Nor should you, or anyone. Its not a black and white situation and you are right, sometimes its good and sometimes its bad.

No, it absolutely is relevant and anyone who tries to say otherwise is guilty of shilling. 
Academic peer review is the pinnacle of progress. Such review cannot occur unless there is a reputation system that is built upon experience.
Experience cannot be measured unless it is recorded.
While we should of course weigh and judge the merit of one's words, regardless of account age, we should not ignore fear propaganda when it is coming from an obvious shill account.
You are engaging in a false dichotomy by ignoring the fact that there is a propaganda war being fought and reddit is the frontlines.   You cannot possibly understand any of this without investing a lot of your personal time researching the facts.
Fortunately, has written some excellent extensive posts on this subject and just how much resistance the community faces by these shill armies.
Account age is absolutely relevant when the person is **not using any factual or technical based arguments to back up his point**. If that account would have backed up his statement with real data and facts, then I wouldn't have made the post I did. 
We cannot ignore that fear tactics are being constantly pushed by propagandists in an attempt to sway community opinion, to make everyone believe that the house is on fire when it clearly is not.

I've seen *a lot* of hacks and bypasses for android based phones. Here's just [one random example] (
There are other ones where they utilize buffer overflow techniques by copying and pasting very long passwords which crashes the lockscreen and allows entry into the phone.
I apologize for the seemingly jibe at you for perhaps being ignorant to linux/luks, you clearly know your stuff. But this does not erase all of the attack vectors that exist for mobile phones.
No real security guy could ever argue that a android phone is more secure than a linux desktop with proper encryption. Not with all of the evidence otherwise. These are hard facts that you cannot argue do not exist. That makes mobile hardware *currently* much more vulnerable than desktop linux clients properly secured.
This may, and probably will, change in the future as mobile phone security becomes better. Especially with better hardware based components integrated with the phones.
But now? That is not the case. And we are talking about *now*, not a theoretical future.

If the economic majority (Exchanges, Wallets, Bridges) run UASF then they will reject blocks that non-SW miners create. So who will pay these miners for their coins that cannot be redeemed for value anywhere?
This also has a snowball effect, in that if only a simple majority enforce UASF, but the others do not, and lets say Exchanges C and D allow for these miners coins, but not Exchanges A and B, we have a situation in which these miners are only able to get paid from a pool of partial liquidity. 
Sure, they might hold some value, and they might get paid, but they are going to be getting paid at a discount. You cannot expect there to be limited demand, excessive supply and for these market participants to get a premium on their product.
How long can these miners continue to get paid a discounted price in a limited market environment? 
I do think that there will be exchanges that will accept these coins, no matter how much consensus is reached by the economic majority. There's always going to be one person that has a small enough business that they will see this opportunity as a advantage to earn exchange fee's on the basis of increased trading for this product that has been deemed worthless elsewhere.
But I doubt that this small niche market will create any sustainable liquidity. Especially not the kind needed to supply the 2.1 million dollars per day in current block reward subsidy.


There is not a non-messy way to have a contentious chain split. There will be chaos, misunderstanding and a depression of price. A price im willing to pay for the long term health of bitcoin. If we do not set the circumstances straight now all it does is create a long term precedent in which a minority mining cabal gets to control the path of bitcoin forever.
That is something that **absolutely must** be addressed, regardless of the effect on price. That threat is vastly larger than the threat of a short term battle and price depression. Bitcoin will bounce back as it always has, and it creates more opportunity for new users to jump in during new lows, as well as great opportunities for vet speculators.

They cannot force you to do anything, but if they give you a direct court order and you go against that order you will be in contempt of court. This comes with legal repercussions such as being thrown in fucking jail.


This is why we have [3rd party canary sites that are devoted to this cause](
The best solution is to have a canary updated on your site AND be subscribed to Canary Watch so that the community will know *for sure* if you've been gag ordered.


Thats just stupid. As if a developer would loose the keys to his site.  If you are at risk of doing that then you should not be developing wallets that hold millions or possibly billions of dollars. 
The best method needs to be PGP signed. The canary update needs to be signed by your key, so that everyone can validate its you. Your pgp public key needs to be posted on your site and a canary watch so that there can be no doubt its you. Then, you inform the community that the key is not in your possession, and that you have a contracted service provider (or a friend) update your canary for you. This way you are not in possession of the pgp key yourself and a court order could never be executed against you to hand over the key. If they cannot have the key because you are not in possession of it, then your canary cannot be updated. Then everyone knows your compromised.
- Please dont listen to this guy. He's giving you really bad advice. You should absolutely be updating your site AND subscribing to canary watch. 
If the worst possible situation happens and you loose your keys the worst that happens is people do not upgrade to your latest software for fear of backdoors until you can assure your community that you are not gag ordered and that you lost your key etc  ...though I doubt this would ever happen.
Common sense should tell you what is right in this situation.

BobAlison, I can only feel that you do not grasp the social complexities of the situation. I've [already responded to this type of comment from you, and explained in detail why your perspective is naive.](
Please do not confuse the sociological actions of Core, Miners, Payment processors etc, as *the actual technological function of the  p2p network*. Its even silly to argue that bitcoin is *fully* decentralized at this point with &gt;60% of the hashing power existing behind one gigantic LAN (Oh great firewall of china!) with the [admin's on serious power tripping episodes]( not to mention enormous resources behind cloudflare. If both china/usa teamed together on the issue, bitcoin could lose 70% of its resources (possibly more) in one single stroke. Thats *not* decentralization. Why do you think core is so freaked out about decentralization? Obviously this wise group of men realize the *real* dangers bitcoin faces and will do anything to be sure that it remains as decentralized as possible.
The way the features are designed, the way support is built, the way decisions are made, *are all made by central planning committees built, designed and governed by humans*. 
Clearly bitcoin is governed by Core, Miners, Payment processors. And while users, at the very end of things can choose which software they run, giving them enormous power, you would have to be a fool to ignore the sociological complexities at hand that *determine how people behave and make choices*. Humans will always behave like humans, and ignoring this will result in a difficult life of constant failures of expectations.
This pipe dream you have is a fairy tale. Ignoring the reality will only hamper your ability to navigate the social complexities of the situation. Core, obviously understands what I am saying, *otherwise they wouldn't be flying representatives to china to discuss these issues with miners*.

What we dont have is a clear plan forward for industry leaders. We need to start this sooner than later if we have any hope of winning this battle. There are some *very* valid questions being posed in this thread by . It brings about the fact that there are currently many unanswered questions and that we need to satisfy these questions with a formal game plan.
Most importantly, we need to act with unity on this issue or there will be wide spread chaos in the bitcoin ecosystem.
I suggest that we use uasf.co as a or  as a sounding board to lobby, but that we need "rules" to lobby for. We need industry leaders saying that they will support this measure, as well as define the circumstances, dates and times that they will no longer support the measure if we cannot reach industry consensus on the issue.
The good news is that the more support we get, the more risk that those who do not support it will absorb by accepting non-SW signaling blocks against a UASF. 
Does anyone have any idea's on where we should move discussion for creating a game plan? Should we create a new subreddit, should we use Slack, IRC, or bitcointalk forums? We cannot do this unless we all agree to start, and then start sounding out idea's and slowly evolve into a solid game plan. But most importantly, we need **all of you**. Including all the wonderful people that I have forgotten to tag.
has already stated [here](


But we can change that if we put together a solid game plan and successfully lobby other economic actors to support the plan. The risk of a reorg against coinbases custodian holdings, as well as any other exchanges, is a very serious risk and the more people we have on board, the more likely they will support​ the plan, for the right economic reasons.

I sincerely doubt that when the LN dev's made the slideshow at the HK meeting stipulating that a *optimum* blocksize for LN was 32mb that they did so because they speculated "adoption of nation-state usage".

And how has that changed? It has always been this way. Bitcoin exchanges have always been the gateway through which governments can regulate.
Either you are failing to understand this, or you are simply trying to create FUD.
Why do you think LN is so important? It allows for much higher efficient decentralized exchanges. This helps resolve the threat you claim exists by "creating precedent", though you naively (or purposefully) are ignoring that exchanges have always had that power.
The Bitcoin system is filled with power balancing mechanisms. The exchanges can be both disrupted/attacked by the users *and* miners if they try to do something as stupid as blacklisting. Users can vote with their wallets and bankrupt the exchanges. Miners can refuse/selectively process transactions associated with exchanges.

Incorrect. The most expensive resource is RAM, not bandwidth or hard drive space. SW is "cheaper" because it impacts the most expensive resource less dramatically than non-SW data. This is how real world costs and benefits work. When something takes less valuable resources, then it becomes cheaper. Something that is abundant and cheap can be distributed cheaply, and something that is rare costs more. Econ101 stuff here.


God you're so stupid its hard to follow you. Im incorrect? here's what I stated ...


My statement was 100% factual and I provided proof which included standard definitions. Are you *really* trying to say you are not wrong and that I'm wrong? I know you're stupid....but really......is this one of those "The entire world is wrong but IM RIGHT" arguments?
Again, you are also engaging in a false dichotomy here. You are trying to state that the engineers who are responsible for design, testing and implementation are not relevant to a technical issue? You are advocating that non-technical people, who are not engineers or experts within a field, should have more weight assigned to their opinions than experts?  I see this anti-intellectualism spread across this entire country right now in all kinds of way's, but here you are, boringly repeating the same stupidity as all these other mentally challenged people.


Here, I'll give you a less technical example so your mind can grasp the reality here.
Engineers design, test and implement trains and train stations.   Yes, the trains and train station needs an economy to operate, but that does not mean that the economy is the one that designed, tested or implemented the trains or train tracks, train stations, etc.  No matter how much the economy wants something, it is ultimately the job of the engineers to design, test and implement a particular feature or upgrade on the train or trains network.
Lets say the train keeps running late. So the economy stops visiting, voting with their wallets, letting the train network know that hey, maybe you should make your trains run faster or optimize them so they are on time. This should illustrate to you what the job of the economy is, and what the job of the engineers is.
So what happens? Well, the engineers and scientists get together and start brainstorming. They evaluate engineering tradeoff's and try to figure out a way to make the trains faster without endangering the people. They eventually come up with a solution that is a good tradeoff that will allow the trains to stay on time without endangering the security of the train.
You are trying to argue that the economy is a authority on engineering.
That would be fucking stupid. The economy is merely participants taking advantage of a product or network which was created by engineers and which will be managed by engineers. If the economy doesn't like it the economy will stop using it. Beyond that, the economy has no say in technical discussions. They are not engineers. Their job is to vote with their money by using or not using said product. 
You are literally trying to argue that engineers are not qualified for engineering and those who are not engineers *should* be qualified for engineering.
You. Are. A. Fucking. Idiot.
Seriously, go away. You are a perfect example of the idiocy that is poisoning our society. You cannot think for yourself and you are so goddamn dumb that you parrot the shit that other stupid people say because you are incapable of rationalizing the facts for yourself.

I do agree, however we need to enable pending work to give us time. There has been clear progress on hard fork research and proposals, and the path forward is neither quick, nor easy.
So let us do what we have been continuing to do. Research, probe, test and find optimal ways to configure future upgrades. In the mean time, lets enable SW, get LN operational and we will have a few years to do the quality research and testing that is needed to propose such a change.
Let the engineers engineer. Let the testers test. But let us not think that experimentation on the main chain is ever an acceptable solution.

It doesn't matter what you release. Unless you are going to mine at a loss there is no possible way for a cloud mining contract to pay out profits to a customer.
How can a business that operates on 1% margins possibly pay out a ROI to customers? The only way would be if you manufacturer the ASIC's yourself plus running them at a hydrodam farm.
One is not enough, you must have both in order to have enough margin that you could pay customers returns without mining at a loss.
Since you are not a ASIC manufacturer im going to go ahead and call this a scam. Yes, before you've released your product.

Core is incapable of "allowing" anything to happen. You seem to be really confused on how decentralized networks operate. It is up to the users to install software, core cannot force anyone to do anything.
So if your argument is "Why didn't core come up with SegWit / Lightning *sooner*" ?
Then the answer would be because quality engineering, design, implementation and testing takes **years**. Also, you cannot know what you dont know. Take yourself back to pre-SW proposal. There was simply no real solutions...and while looking in hindsight is 100%, looking forward is not. So coming at the situation from a "I know it all" perspective looking into the past is *easy*. Try actually being a engineer and coming up with elegant solutions with good tradeoffs for a extremely complex situation and you might have a little less of a shitty attitude about the situation.
You do realize that LN was first proposed over 3 years ago right? Why do you think its taken so long to get to this point?
Probably something to do with *a million lines of code*, design, implementation, testing testing testing, redesign, reimplementation, progress, testing testing testing....
This ignorant bashing of Core for causing problems only underscores the complexity of the problems involved.
Are you suggesting that Core should have raised the blocksize and allowed the network to be constantly ddos'd before a fix was proposed?
I think you are. I think you are saying "They could have done it" when you just dont even understand the facts or the history behind the problems. Core couldn't hardfork to 2MB because there was no max sigops per block fix.  Do you really think it was rational for the engineers of a system to propose a change that purposefully would break the system? 
But all of this FUDstering aside...this argument...


Is highly flawed. Miners are going to make much much more money mining bitcoin when bitcoin has a 1000x more case uses and is massively more valuable. This will only mean increased competition to get into blockspace, which means massively increased fee's, as the micro layer is handled on LN.
Its only people who just dont understand the facts that seem to come out the woodwork with these shitposts.

Whether it's Jian or Jihan, sorry but we do not negotiate with terrorists. Just because these Chinese miners put their Chinese ego and pride ahead of the best interest of the network doesn't mean that they get to dictate the future of Bitcoin.
The entire point of Bitcoin is that it is a censorship resistant money. It cannot be censorship resistant if a cabal of Chinese miners who are controlled by a dictatorship state get to decide the rules.
It is as important as ever looking at the hash rate and seeing the recent news of asicboost that we take a stand against central actors attempting to monopolize Bitcoin through force. Bitcoins future depends upon resistance, exactly this kind. If we cave into central forces now you all might as well sell all your BTC because Bitcoin is dead sooner than later.
The only thing that these guys care about is their personal profits and their egos. There is more than enough evidence to demonstrate that they are willing to sabotage the network for unfair competitive advantages and over ego.

I think that this opinion piece is a relative view of Amir's philosophy. Im a little confused by it honestly, because his opinion on blocksize to me seems to align with a more banker-ish point of view in that the bitcoin blockchain should be a settlement layer as opposed to a payment system. He said -


But isnt this entirely against the philosophy of bitcoin? Is not bitcoin supposed to replace the existing monetary infastructure by creating a viable alternative that is supported by the people in a decentralized fashion, as opposed to centralized control?
How can bitcoin do that as a settlement layer? How can anyone argue for settlement layers fully well knowing that such a move would cost-out a large portion of the world by making the fee's so high that they would then be not-so-advantageous to the already existing financial infrastructure?
I've always been a Amir fan, and would love to see him back in the community. But im a little surprised by his viewpoint here, because it seems rather conflict with his anarcho-capitalistic mentality where the people create a new financial system to bypass the old system.
And bitcoin as a p2p payment protocol is *not* "papering over cracks of the existing monetary infrastructure"
Rome was not built in a day, and obviously there would be bridges that would be needed to be built to link the new system with the old system as the new system cannot just overcome the incumbents in days. Its a slow lecherous process that takes enormous time and resources to accomplish.

You can see my response [here]( which says...


Yes, lets fire the most competent doctors scientists engineers who engage in public peer review and instead rely upon the people who have been proven to be completely reckless and lack all credibility. That makes so much sense. /s
Thanks for making your position clear. I will be sure to spread this as far and as wide as possible so that users know that you are putting politics infront of progress.


I cannot express how sad and frustrating it is to have a miner in this industry express such non-factual statements compounded by such excessive stupidity/ignorance.
Core has pushed out SegWit, which is a enormous upgrade to bitcoins capabilities both present and the ability to upgrade in the future. It allows for Lightning Network like layers to compete within a free market to redistribute resource costs to economically incentivized nodes, a problem that bitcoin *cannot fix* and will always remain a problem.
Your ignorance of demanding to burden the alturistic bitcoin node operators with resources that would surely cripple the network is ignorant at **best** and sounds more like malicious behavior to me, considering that you should know better being within the industry.
As I explain it here in detail [here]( -








Substantial reduction of node count decreases bitcoins security directly by reducing decentralization and making censorship more probable. Ironically, SW fixes this by re-aligning UTXO costs, so it actually kills multiple birds with one stone. Yet we are still fighting its activation despite all of the major positive benefits it has towards not only the security of the network, but the *progress* of the networks capabilities.
Detractors complain about the state of being, all while blocking the upgrade that resolves that state of being.
Its simply madness.
Also need to add that quadratic hashing (cpu ddos attack vector), while fixed in SW, is not fixed for old-style transactions on legacy bitcoin addresses. So the reason SW increases the blocksize in the way it does is to allow for a blocksize upgrade without decreasing the security of the network by opening up quadratic hashing attack vectors. So if we were to do a SW + 2MB HF, then miners could construct a block that takes 12+ minutes to verify. This would ddos nodes off the network.
This is why anyone who advocates for hardforking to upgrade blocksize is either being purposefully ignorant to the point of recklessness, or is showing their ignorance by demonstrating that they do not understand the cause and effect of engineering changes to the system.
If you get what you want, then you'll have bitcoin lose almost half of its nodes overnight, miner centralization (as if that was not already a problem with Bitmain monopolizing the industry) and the censorship of bitcoin.
As [Nick Szabo has gone on the record saying](


I know you want transaction fee's to be cheaper. So why dont you support the pending upgrade that allows for **near free transactions of unlimited capacity with 0-confirmations**. It blows my mind that someone could be so stupid as to not see how incredibly valuable a upgrade that is for bitcoin.
It blows my mind that people cannot get past their reckless ideologies and political positions to see whats best for bitcoin.
It blows my mind that miners, such as can see the positive $ effect that even just the **anticipation** of SegWit activation on LTC, and **still** reject the premise, knowing in full effect what positive price action that catalyst would have upon LTC and BTC.
Its quite obvious that these miners are no longer working in the best interests of the system, and we must fire these miners from acting against the best interests of the system. We expected miners to operate based on doing what is within *their own* best economic interests, but its clear that miners like ProHashing either have hidden agenda (like asicboost) or are working against their own economic interests.
If you do not activate segwit, all you will do is force a showdown with a user activated softfork. You **will lose** against the industry. Your coins will be worthless and you will mine yourself into bankruptcy, and good fucking riddance to poisonous rats like you and Jihan who are putting politics ahead of progress.

Thats what UASF is for. If UASF does not work then the next option will be a standard flag day activation. This proposal is going to go no where and has already been debated months ago on the drawbacks with little positive tradeoffs.
I hate this assumption "because we cannot do A or B we *must* do C"
We can do nothing until we reach consensus. Submitting another proposal and attempting to shove it down everyones throats is not going to be more effective than planning **years** designing a elegant upgrade for bitcoin (SW + LN).
Thats the great thing about bitcoin....we dont have to do anything and it will still be awesome. It will just force a lot of activity off-chain, which of course sucks, but I would rather force activity off chain than sabatoge bitcoin with a contentious fork with a proposal that experts clearly cannot reach consensus on.
There was a proposal that experts did reach consensus on though.....

And once you accept that, then you must accept that those who are dictating this policy from a appeal of authority by distroing these options from the satoshi github, ironically, with this particular attribute against his original intentions, are acting as economic policy dictators.

You absolutely do partially own the network in your own little way, and everyone's collective actions is what makes this system determine value.

Edit - humor aside I think that this post highlights a simple common premise that a lot of people have a hard time admitting. I am constantly engaged with people here who think that they know and understand Bitcoin despite the fact that they have spent very little time at all trying to understand the complexity of the system. There are people that sub here that have been here for years you don't even know the acronyms let alone the complexed nuances of how the different parts of the system interact with each other to make Bitcoin function. 
It's okay to not know Bitcoin because really I think no one knows "all" of Bitcoin other than maybe a few people who have reviewed just about every line of code. And it's good to admit that you don't know Bitcoin. I don't know all of Bitcoin. I don't even know remotely all of Bitcoin and you will never hear me claim to be an expert. But after spending almost 4 years daily studying the web of interconnected mechanisms I have a rough idea of how the system functions even if a lot of the underlying technical debt and trade-offs I don't understand.
Make great again by going back to the way it was before when I think most of us acknowledge that we don't understand Bitcoin. It makes for a much more humble setting where we can all get along better.

I think peoples actions have ramifications and people should be held accountable when they do things that have cause and negative effect.
When a "trusted node" within a community starts spreading misinformation or crafting a message to build a specific narrative by purposefully leaving out valid options, that that person should be punished for it socially for his conceit.
So when you take the  option, formed by all experts in the community, and then you leave that option off the plate and conduct a survey for it, yes, you should be punished socially for contributing to the problem.
If you prove through *your own actions* that you are aligned against the cause, with full knowledge that experts have reached consensus on a technical path forward....then purposefully construct a message designed against that consensus....
Yes, I think you should be punished for it, socially. If that means being banned from a channel then so be it.
You say you support SW, but your actions say otherwise. This is lip service my man, you cannot have it both ways. This is not about "preference" such as your favorite cultural food. This is about engineering solutions that only engineers are qualified to make determinations on. You and your buddies can chit chat all day along about orange chicken vs burritos, but this is not about something that the average person understands from a technical level, and laymen can only have limited knowledge on the subject. 
No amount of shitposting surveys to the gross uneducated masses is going to solve problems. What it **will do** is contribute to the problem by creating a pitchforking horde of uneducated but emotionally charged individuals to work against the path that engineers have determined consensus on.
Nick Szabo said it accurately enough to you here....

Well. Lets rationalize this then?
Bitmain is using a covert exploit on PoW that gives their miners a 30% boost (assuming greg is being truthful of course). 
You think Bitmain wouldn't fight to the death to make sure that the feature is not nullified? And that it just "so happens" that SW nullifies it? You think that the market share that they have gained through this optimization is going to be freely given up? Obviously the fight has been for ASICBOOST this entire time. Now we know why they are mining empty blocks! The devil is in the details.
This is as damning as it gets for Bitmain and Friends ™
This explains everything. It explains all of the irrational actions, it explains why they are doing things that are seemingly against their economic interest (blocking SW/LN).

Do you have any data to backup this speculation? While transactional growth is certainly positive, I dont think that its going to outpace moore's law short term (5-10 years).  A shitty laptop can handle the network just fine right now, and in 5 years im sure a shitty laptop of that time will also be able to handle it just fine, looking at transactional growth all time. 
@_date: 2016-02-20 18:43:36


Because it does *not* offer a 2mb increase. It offers, *at best* short term about a 1.3mb effective blocksize. By short term I mean 2016. It does not effect the size of blocks for regular transactions, which is &gt; 90% of all financial activity on the blockchain. The compression will be most seen in P2SH transactions which are a very small minority.
The reason there is a "call for revolution" is because they are playing with fire by attempting to dictate economic policy. As we get closer to the blocksize cap, we will start to see fee's substantially increase. Once those fee's start to increase, we are going to be wading through this *shit* all over again. There's going to be more HF proposals to "offer relief", more fear speculation, etc etc.
The appropriate thing to do would be to schedule a HF that is going to eliminate the *possibility* of creating a artificial fee market. Looking at the draft proposal, it seems they are not offering much wiggle room as of this very moment, but I will wait for the final draft before getting *really* upset about it.

This, along with the "Bitcoin foundation" were some of the biggest mistakes in the last 4 years. It was absolutely wrong to try to create a centralized faction of control on either sides of the table. All that has happened since then is that there has been disillusionment from what can only constitute as a few centralized miners in that they now think that they have control over the protocol and can broker agreements with developers to get their way.
That is not how Bitcoin was designed and that is not how Bitcoin works. If this man is as intelligent and as sophisticated as Gregory indicates then he should realize this. But what you were seeing instead is someone's ego getting in the way of his rationality. 
You cannot rationalize against someone's ego you can only destroy it. Now is the time to take the stand and to let miners understand that they do not control Bitcoin.
Their job is ordering transactions and they are paid for their work. If they want to unionize their faction then that goes against the decentralized nature of Bitcoin and they should be fired.
Chinese miners have become the most radicalized poisonous force in Bitcoin and I don't think that there is any fruits that will be born from further negotiation.
@_date: 2016-02-22 04:55:55


Could you please rationalize why you think this is the case? I've watched several presentations with LN dev's and I seem to recall them discussing the "why not" when it came to centralized *large* payment hubs, but they also were honest in that they did not know how it would really pan out. Just that there were no real incentives for large payment hubs to exist. Im not sure I believe it however, as these would appear to be reputation based hubs. If not reputation based, how else do we factor which hub we should use?
As for how I am imagining them, it is as a distributed spoke and hub model. However I dont think that really clarifies anything, or helps resolve the concerns I have described.


Wouldn't that require all of these users to be online? But, lets take your statement further. If everyone is their own hub, and they have a hotwallet that contains btc, then are you implying that *everyone* would then be susceptible in a "worst case" situation of a Heartbleed, SSL/DNS vurn? 
I think you are actually making me feel even more pestimistic of this model if that is the case. Im sure im missing a "big picture" thing, because I doubt that such esteemed cryptographers would put such hopes into this system if it was that simple to break.

Thinking through it a little more, he may be technically correct (on the slowdown part). Since nodes rely upon other nodes connecting to them in order to broadcast transactions, there would be slower propagation of messages across the system as the system becomes more saturated.
How slowed? I would imagine in the milliseconds, but probably not more than a second or 2? People constantly forget that we communicate at the speed of light. Im always amazed that I can speak to people in real time on the other side of the planet by interconnecting light tubes going under the sea.
As long as there are interconnected nodes with decent connections and hardware (as in, not a RPI 1), then there should be very little delay between receiving and redistributing a message. 
But, the main ignorance here demonstrated by roger is  in not understanding the tradeoffs. The more nodes the better the security, and if that means a extra few milliseconds propagation time, then I would be more than willing to trade it.
I would be willing to trade *entire seconds* if it meant the doubling or tripling of node count. The security of the system is many fold higher in importance than the propagation of broadcasted transactions....especially since those transactions are not likely to be included into a block for *at least* 1 minute, and sometimes 40 minutes depending on luck.
So when you take into account transaction ordering, block luck, what does 1 second matter? It seems entirely irrelevant when you are comparing it to something so fundamentally important as decentralization+security.
@_date: 2016-02-26 02:47:54


Then I guess you didn't read the extent of what I wrote. I agree that constrained resources would drop node count, and in order to haved 10mb *today* we would need 10mb *worth of transactions* to fill them.
Thats not going to  happen. Where would the extra 2,000% of users come from making these transactions? Its a silly argument when you think about the underlying truth.
The blocksize raise is merely intended to relieve pressure. Just because its raised higher doesn't mean they will be filled. Where the argument gets more rational is when we discuss attack vectors with effectively a cpu ddos.
Im pro-lightning and pro-decentralization.

To add on top of this, everyone seems to understand that miners are aligned with the best interest of the network through economic incentives, but they dont seem to grasp how it is that the economy rules the miners in these situations. But in order to truly understand the system, you must figure out "where" in the system each piece fits and the "when" of each action.
Miners have multiple "whens/wheres". They start at the top by minting new bitcoins, but when it comes to complex situations such as a possible chain split then the question becomes "which top and when/why". So now we have a complex game theory scenario in which the miners have to decide which way they want to go to serve their best interests.
This is where the "where/when" starts to get jumbled up. You see, usually the market participants come after the minters in the organization scheme of a *established* system.
But what if there is a new currency? Who then is at the top? The minters, or the market?
I think its common sense to understand that if the market does not value this new currency, then the minters will be less inclined to mint. Why would they waste their resources minting something in which the market would not buy or will buy at a much discounted rate for the same amount of minting labor?
So as you can see, we just went from the miners being on the top and the market participants being below to the exact opposite....where it is the market that changes the actions of the minters.
This is of course how bitcoin works. We've already established value  for bitcoin so the miners will continue to mine bitcoin unless there is a competitor that offers a more advantageous revenue stream.
We can prove this by looking at the [list of current 256SHA coins]( and then comparing both market cap and mining power to establish some basic assumptions about the reality of economics in a 1:1 system where miners can choose A or B based on $ value.
Since we will have a "A or B" situation (Core or BU) in which both use the same algorithm, then its up to the **market** to determine the value of the new currency and whether it is in the best interest of the miners to spend money mining it.
Now, if all/most of the economic participants say "We want to btc go forward and not BU" ....then that establishes the value of the newcomer, which would be much less than the incumbent.
We already know this to be the case with the bitfinex BTC vs BTU tokens, the market has already spoken on the lack of value of BTU. But if the central economic business activity providers are all (or even just a simple majority) are behind the incumbent and not the new competitor.....well then simple economics would imply that miners will follow suite.
The only question I have that is unanswered is.....
How long can miners stay irrational for, before they give up? This will become a obvious tragedy of the commons situation where one will follow the next who follows the next etc. Miners will see the value of BTU is lower, and they will flock to BTC. This will happen pretty quickly, and I think it will be settled within 2-3 weeks time in that the writing will be on the wall.
Honestly, I do hope that Jihan and his Chinese pools continue to mine BU forever. I hope they split off, and waste their resources on their shitcoin until they go bankrupt. This is like deleveraging. The players who overextended themselves and made bad decisions get called and the market is gotten rid of their poison.
Thanks Stephen Pair, we really appreciate you being a stand up guy and doing the right thing.

Yet research on the topic, such as the [bitfury whitepaper]( clearly shows substantially negative effects upon node count even with minimal upgrades to blocksize. The paper shows an immediate 40% reduction of node count and 50% over 6 months.
That becomes 80% when we go to 4mb.
The reason the numbers are so drastic is because it is RAM that is the bottleneck, not hard drive space, the former being expensive and the latter cheap.
Fortunately, SegWit realigns UTXO cost by understanding this hardware cost matrix, which should greatly help node count not diminish as much as indicated within this research paper.
We cannot argue this topic inside a vacuum. If we are going to discuss the issue then we must examine all of the evidence and not ignore the things that don't suit our narrative. We cannot ignore the fact that Bitcoin as a centralized monetary system is literally worthless. So if we are to do what's best for Bitcoin then we need to do everything we can to preserve its value propositions. I understand that this means that we all cannot have coffee on the main chain and at the same time expect Bitcoin to remain all of its valuable fundamental properties.
Fortunately for everyone the engineer's have designed a system that realigns all of the economic incentives and does it on the second layer so as to not sacrifice Bitcoins security layer with experimentation. Lightning Network fixes the node incentivization problem that Bitcoin currently struggles with. Those who participate in the system as hubs will be economically rewarded for the resources that are utilized on their Hardware.
And the best part about it is it does it with all the same security guarantees as the main chain but with many improvements such as near free costs and zero confirmation times.
It's literally the best possible outcome that anyone could want and yet we are still fighting the issue today despite overwhelming evidence and expert consensus on the issue.
Do we really need to go down this line again guys? Has this really not been debated enough over the last two years? There are no reasonable arguments against this path. All of them assume conspiracy theories or ideological preference that has nothing to do with technicalities.

This is a accurate statement, but I would point out that 1.7mb is assuming 100% adoption. So using 1.7 and the word 'minimum' in the same sentence is either purposefully or accidentally misleading people into thinking that at a minimum we will see a effective blocksize increase to 1.7mb with SW.
That would be a false representation. At MOST we will see 1.7mb with non-P2SH tx's. Considering that less than 10% of the tx's of todays real world usage uses P2SH, we can assume that at *best* short term (6-12 months) we will only see a 1.3-1.5mb effective blocksize increase.
People need to be clear on the real numbers here. Those numbers are based on current usage of P2SH and non-P2SH transactions and scaled with the steady rise of usage.
Also my statement was *not* false because I was talking about non-P2SH transactions. Put the conversation in context and it becomes true. I added the context to make it more clear to you and anyone else.

You said -


So I provided a example in which consensus was achieved for a arbitrary reason. I did this to show you that your logic is flawed. Just because we have *developer* consensus does not mean that we have a *economic* consensus. If the developers make a rule that the people dont like the people will fork them out of the scenario.


You are using context that is favorable to your narrative. Each of these bitcoinocracy coin polls are avoiding the original narrative - that we have consensus for a 2mb upgrade.
The reason the polls are so widely erratic is because we are talking about *alternative implementations like classic*. Of *course* there is going to be a split with the people over implementing a alternative client! DUH!
But if core just listened to the people and offered a 2mb upgrade with segwit, we would have near 100% consensus on the issue. That is what the main point is about and ignoring that fact is ignoring the greater argument. Do you really think thats untrue? That if core put a 2mb HF on the roadmap today that the people would rebel against it? Absurd.

I have not. I stated that even at avg of 90% full this means many blocks will peak at 100% and it will create a artificial fee market. I understand that block sizes fluctuate. But that does not matter because blocks filling up and fee pressure is exponential. As soon as *some* blocks start filling up, then we create a enormous push on mempool resources due to non-confirming transactions getting priced out by the artificial fee market.
This is *not* what core developers should be doing. They are not dictators of economic policy and should not be trying to play this game. They should allow the technology to be open to free market principals, to allow the economy to decide. They should limit the capsize within reason, to prevent DDoS on the network (see [bip143]( , but beyond that they should not be interfering with economics. 
Interfering with economics means that bitcoin has already failed. If bitcoin is subject to political influence then it has failed its missing. Playing economic advisers and artificially straining resources means bitcoin as as a demonstrated decentralized architecture resistant to politics has failed.

The difference is is that the people who would be defending bitmain here would be an extreme minority while the people who were slandering bitmain over there would be in the extreme majority.
If you think otherwise you obviously have not participated that enough on both sides of the aisle or you are engaged in entrenched irrational thinking. There is always going to be a small minority on this sub that run to defend Bitcoin Unlimited, Jihan Wu, Bitmain, Roger etc. I don't think it is lost on anyone that those same people who are defending them are active participants on rbtc.
I think this post just points out your delusion if you think that the majority of people in this community would be advocating for the centralization of mining. We are extreme on decentralization, which is exactly what Bitcoin needs to stay strong.

No, it did not have to do with miners not confirming transactions. It had to do with the fact that there was a lapse in a block confirm, so it took longer than normal, and then the next few blocks needed to play "catch up" because there were more transactions than what could fit in a single 1MB block.
That right there is undeniable proof to me. I see valid people making valid non-spam transactions and they are waiting 1-2 hours sometimes for 1 confirmation.
And this is during a non-spam period. How do you think its going to be in 3-4 months? or 6?
SW ~~only discounts~~ *only provides substantial discounts for* P2SH. It does not effect regular transactions *substantially*. Regular transactions are the issue here, not P2SH. They make up the lions share of network activity.
Im happy we are making progress forward as a community, but im not happy about the delay delay delay that has gone on over what is a neccessary function. LN needs a bigger block size. So arguing that we need to restrict blocksize to prepare for LN is the biggest shit sandwich argument I've ever seen.

Am I supposed to ignore that this is the problem? Sorry but no, im going to call a spade a spade. This is absolutely a issue with chinese pride. 
You can dance around your delicate little snowflakes to make sure no one is offended by the truth while I keep telling the truth.
Chinese have a traditional cultural obsession with money that goes waaaay way back. They will run this network into the ground to make a few extra million bucks then laugh at everyone at how rich they are and how poor everyone else is. This is quite clearly demonstrated with Jihan stalling the entire networks progress so that he can capitalize off his anti-competitive technologies which directly harm the health of the network.
This has everything to do with Chinese pride and ego. There is only economic and pride rationalization factors here. Either its "They broke HK agreement and our pride is suffered" or its "We want to take advantage of our secret technology at the expense of everyone else"
Both directly relate to Chinese pride and ego.

Technocracy is good. It just unfortunately has spillover. People always seek idols as its a part of the tribalistic nature of humanity. We just can't help it.
I do agree with you but I also think we shouldn't fight this aspect too hard because people who succeed frequently likely *are* more adept at business challenges and we *should* listen to them. Key word here - Listen. Listen, hear, process...and only if we think their vision has merits should we join in and participate.
Balaji was important enough to get a lot of investors to listen to him based on his past success. Look at 21inc now? Wtf are they doing?
Investors bet wrong. They didn't (or couldn't) listen and process. They didn't realize his idea was absolute shit and instead they threw money at the bitcoin foundation building hype-train.
And yes, a unsuccessful (or stupid) person can be successful and have good ideas. But the difference is in execution and contiunation. You can be half-smart with a good EQ and be a billionare, as long as you can come up with "good enough" ideas and are charismatic and motivated enough to convince others and carry through. Its not about intelligence, its about lack of stupidity combined with charisma!

While I would agree that bitcoin is no where near that level, I would also speculate that within 5 years we could potentially see that level of usage, and since this is a *global* system we dont need 280m to be allocated to one nation. 
Also, why did you use lvl3 instead of lvl1 for your figure? I see 672k users represented at 32mb at lvl1, which is well within our *current* # of users. Which is a pretty large difference.

It will with LN. It cannot on-chain. [Here's a great video on the reality of scaling on-chain]( ...
In that video dryja talks about how 1.6GB blocks would only be able to handle a single large metropolitian area's daily transactions. 
To think that bitcoin can have 1TB blocks for a large country ( let alone multiple TB for the world) and still be censorship resistant is crazy talk. To think 1.6GB blocks could remain decentralized is crazy talk.
People dont understand game theory. They dont have vision. They cannot see the path that goes forward once you start increasing resource costs beyond a standard computer. Thats how you destroy decentralization.
Bitcoin can and will solve the unbanked problem. But it will do it on layer2 networks that have aligned economic incentives and optimized transactional outputs.
Bitcoin never could scale. Ever. Not without retaining the things that make it valuable. So wishful thinking gets us no where.

So we should ignore the fact that Jihan And Roger Ver directly funded this? And therefore ignore all of the context of the situation regarding ASICBOOST?
I agree with your sentiment in general. We absolutely should focus on the technicals. But we also shouldn't ignore the smoke either. 
There are plenty of rational objections to extension blocks based on purely technicals. But I think considering what has been uncovered in the last 2 weeks we should also be "following the money" and vocalize those conclusions to the community, and *let the community judge these actors*.
Its pretty clear that we have a monopolistic force that is trying to buy development to fit **their and only their** business model, without consideration for the entire networks best benefits.
We would be doing the entire community a disservice to not bring sunlight on these issues.

Businesses dont just pop up overnight, and then the next day have 40k tx's.
When you see a substantial uptick in transactions, there almost always follows some good blockchain analysis that discovers a pattern of behavior indicative of spam.

Dogecoin was created [literally as a joke]( and it hit a 2 **billion** market cap.
Thats pretty good evidence that the market is filled with fucking retards. Some of you may say "Well then those retards are just going to have to loose" and I guess if your a libertarian or free market ideologist, you might be correctly applying your ideology to the situation.
I am however, more empathetic than that. I recognize that human beings are generally not sophisticated, and all want to get ahead of the curve by investing into the next google and apple. So they take risks. Your grandparents take risks, your boss takes risks, you take risks ...literally everyone takes risks. They take these risks because they don't understand the technology...and frankly? They probably never will.
And most of *you all* probably don't understand the technology, and probably never will. I can say that I dont have a complete understanding of bitcoin, and so can literally 99.9999999999% of humanity because the only people who truly understand it all are the ones contributing to the bitcoin core repo, mostly who have academic degrees in mathematics/cryptography or computer sciences. And the CS guys don't even come nearly as close to understanding as the math guys do.
The point being - Literally everyone is ignorant about cryptocurrencies, in that they cannot fully understand how the technology works. Nor can we predict the future. Whether the technology is good or not is irrelevant, all that matters is - Is it good enough? Do enough people  *think* its good enough that it can bootstrap and have network effects? Was it good enough to withstand competition in the scope of these network effects? How resiliant is it?
All this rambling is to setup a premise that we are all ignorant to an extent, and we (if we have invested into crypto) are all *gambling* on this technology.
Im not a free market ideologist. Im not a crazy person who believes that society will operate well if we deregulate everything. I recognize that human greed / self preservation will always be the individuals  priority, and that means if humans can get away with fucking over other humans in the form of scams/ponzi's/whatever, they will do so.
The point is - Regulation that favors the public interest is *good*. This is exactly what Thomas Piketty has *proven* with his academic work that investigates over a thousand years of socio-economic data.
And we as a society have a responsibilty to each other. The better society operates as a whole, the better we all do. United we stand fuckers.
So no, I don't agree with you here. I think when we can so explicitly and empirically point to a scam-coin, then we absolutely *should* regulate in this circumstance and protect against it.
To argue against this is to argue against vaccines. This is literally the premise of vaccines. That we all take action to regulate society so that people who are vulnerable have less risk of death or life long health risks. Replace health risks with financial risks without regulating scam-coins and we have a pretty accurate comparison between the two.


This however, i can agree with. Slippery slope this is, and that is the crux with regulation. Light regulation good, heavy regulation (depending on circumstances) can hinder developing markets and work against valuable information discovery. Heavy regulation as it relates to human health, the EPA, etc, I can wholeheartedly agree with. Heavy regulation in cryptocurrencies I generally don't because of how nascent the industry is, and we still need time to evaluate where this is all going.
But BSV? We know that shits a scam. Everyone knows it. The dude got caught many times in the act of scamming. We don't need more information....we don't need to evaluate...we **know with conviction** that he's a scammer.

@_date: 2016-02-25 22:31:42


No problem. I do believe we *could* scale, but I personally dont feel that would be the best route for bitcoin. Decentralization is the *most* important feature of bitcoin and we need to do everything we can to promote that. 2mb blocks wont kill decentralization, but 2GB blocks surely would. The question is how far in the future will it be that we would *need* 2gb blocks, and what would the current constraints be? Would we have a similar ratio today, that 2gb would be like 2mb, say, 20 years in the future? Its definitely possible, but im not willing to gamble bitcoin's decentralization on it.
But that does not mean that im going to walk around spreading ignorance to support my narrative. 
As for sybil attacks, what of them? My opinion is that its a long-standing issue that is *probably* unresolvable in any short duration (less than 5 years), but so long as we improve the protocol/ecosystem there is a economic incentive for node operators  which should offset any potential negative side effects of sybil attacks.
gmaxwell's proof of storage (I think thats what he called it) is the best solution for sybil attacks, but such theories have been put on the backburner for years as we prioritize more pressing issues of decentralization, fungibility, etc.

Then you should stop participating with bitcoin because it is a totally and completely wildly inefficient system ....*by design*. Bitcoin is not intended, designed or expected to be "efficient".
Decentralization is required for security. Anything that negatively impacts decentralization should be fought as if bitcoins existence depends on it. If you are advocating for a reduction of decentralization, then you are the enemy of bitcoin. 
No, we will not trade "efficiency" for "security". What you are thinking of right now is called Paypal or Venmo. Its a *very* efficient system and you should use it.
Do not ever expect decentralized systems to be efficient. They are not intended or designed to be. They are intended and designed to be **resistant** to central control. That is the sole purpose of decentralization.

You have a problem with labels. You have no idea my views, where I stand or what my labels *should* be. Creating these labels as attacks on my commentary only show that you are incapable of rational discourse. I believe in balance, which means that socialism and capitalism must play hand in hand. Only a naive human being believes that free markets exist. If it was not for government, we would not forest because for profit companies would take all the resources. We would not have police men, or fire fighters, or trash services, or fucking plumbing for that matter. These are socialistic programs that only a idiot would argue are unneeded in a society filled with humans.

I used [this site]( to help me setup my raspberry pi 2 node. Since setting it up, other than tweaking it when we started suffering major spam attacks, I've needed to do *zero* maintenance. I just put it on my startup (/etc/rc.d/rc.local) and whenever there is a a power outage it boots up, updates any blocks it missed while it was down automatically and then runs beautifully.
The best part? You *feel good* contributing to a much needed resource on the network. belcher here makes a lot of very valid points, but the most important point to me is simply the altruistic action. Thats important to me as a human being in society, and doing good things is good.
Spend that $35, buy yourself a PI, encase a old HD, grab a powered usb hub and let that little bad boy run! I think the pi 2 will be good for at least another year or two. By then we will see upgraded versions, pi 3, pi 4 etc, which will have much more ram and be better suited to handle the networks load at a cheap cost.

Agreed on the cancer, disagree on the "trivial". Creating and managing a new derivatives exchange marketplace with orderbook matching that allows miners and mining manufacturers  to lock in revenue at a fixed rate by utilizing futures is not exactly 3rd grade homework. 
Its going to take a lot of money and resources to get this going.
I think its a really cool idea because it allows for less risk with a guaranteed ROI, which should lower the barrier for entry on miners and therefore should increase decentralization, if I've applied my game theory correctly.

This is simply untrue. It absolutely does not require transactions to be sorted in a special way.

Ehhh, I would disagree with the "sleazy" commentary. He was optimizing profits, and thats what miners are supposed to do.
But the entire reason for a complex PoW in the first place is to make mining as computationally as difficult as possible. So if we find out miners have discovered exploits to monopolize the industry, then the software needs to be tailored to fix these vulnerabilities to prevent further mining centralization.
This was always a threat from the beginning and bitcoin was designed with it in mind.
This is a cat and mouse game. Neither the cat, nor the mouse is "bad" in this situation, but its what the mouse has been up to on the sidelines that is concerning. We now know why they have been fighting so hard against SW. It has nothing to do with ideologically driven agenda....it has to do with securing their optimizations.
It never made sense that they would complain about blocksize and mine empty blocks. Well now we know why!
Peter Todd's reply on the devlist sums it up great ...


to block non-covert usage of it as well. In a low margin business like mining,
the advatange it gives is enormous - quite possibly 10x your profit margin -
and given that barrier free access to being able to purchase ASICs is already
an archilles heal for Bitcoin there is every reason to eliminate this legal
vulnerability. Additionally, it's a technical vulnerability as well: we want
getting into the ASIC manufacturing and design business to have as low barriers
to entry as is feasible, and the ASICBOOST exploit significantly increases the
minimum capital requirements to do so.


field. Anything that inhibits a level playing field is an exploit. While this
isn't standard crypto - we can't fix every exploit completely - since we're
going to do a technical change to partially mitigate the ASCIBOOST exploit
there is every reason to fully mitigate it.

[A regulation is a legal norm intended to shape conduct that is a by-product of imperfection.[1] A regulation may be used to prescribe or proscribe conduct ("command-and-control" regulation), to calibrate incentives ("incentive" regulation), or to change preferences ("preferences shaping" regulation").](
Yes, obviously governments impose regulation. But your blatant misunderstanding of the terminology and its usage shows you are either much more grossly uneducated than expected, or that you are being purposefully and willfully ignorant.
Any rules that [set or adjust the amount, degree, or rate of (something, blockchain, transaction thoroughput, blocksize, anything)]( *is regulation, and it has nothing to do with government*.
Learn basic terminology and the definitions when you argue a point. You seem rather coherent in other messages, and I've even seen you argue rational points, but this is a blatant misrepresentation of the terminology and understanding.


The cost of operating on the network is part of the miners incentive. Are you a miner? No? if you are, you are compensated by block reward. If you are running a node, *as I am as well*, then that is a altruistic action on your behalf and your reward is to bolster the network to increase the value of your investment. Either way, its your choice to spend your resources as a node and no one has any obligation to reward you for any amount for any of your efforts.

You seem to be grasping at some theoretical scenario that goes on in your head, but when taken with a macro perspective, or just the real data, really makes no sense.
Are you even aware of what inflation is and how it works? Do you know what the historical inflation numbers are, in say, the past 15 years? I think if you did, you wouldn't be discussing this topic with the wild *theories* you are propsing.
Take a look. 


The fact that you used "Big Mac Combo" as your example makes me think you are...well...very young. Why not use milk or bread as the historical examples? Why not discuss the CPI, which is the measurement that you are so vaguely referring to?
If the question is, do I see the CPI changing so drastically, despite all evidence to the contrary, that in my lifetime I will see a 1000% increase to the CPI?
The answer is absolutely not. 
That chart shows you the last 100 years of recorded CPI. Pay special attention to the great depression (1929-1939). The great depression. If you look at our Great Recession of 2008, you can see we only shed a max of 50% of our market before bouncing back and stabilizing.
Unlike the Great Depression, which shed nearly 80% of the value, retracting, before it bounced back. 
So if you use the great depression as a measuring stick, of just how fucked things can get (losing 80% of your market is extreme extreme situation. Banking collapse, market collapse, etc). 
Hopefully you are following me. Now compare the CPI. Look especially at 1929-1932 ...
-6.4, -9.3, -10.3
Then the market picked back up in 32, and you can see the CPI stabalized back into the positive, 1933 being 0.8, then 1934 1.5, then 3.0, then 1.4, then 2.9 ....meaning that if milk was $1.00, in 1930 it would be 1.06, then $1.15 in 1931, then $1.25 in 1932. 
By 1937 it was back down to roughly $1.15 again. Yet at that point the S&amp;P had only rebounded back to 50% of the peak of the bubble. The market lost 50% of its value, and milk only rose 15%
You see the pattern here? Market plummets, CPI sheds no more than 30% in what was a HORRIFIC market crash. 80% of the market drops, we only have to pay 15% more for eggs.
Now, tell me all about this wild theory of $50 Big Mac combo's. What data do you have to backup such a wild claim? Because history, even at its worst, has shown the USA to be *extremely resilient*, for the people to not bear hyper-inflation, unlike nazi Germany, or Zimbabwe, or Venezuela.
Economics is not a small pie. Its a gigantic piece, and you really need to study how it works before coming up with these idea's and throwing them out on the internet. You need to read, a lot. You need to grasp at the mechanics of it for years before solidifying a macro perspective of how it functions. And even then, you are still a slobbering idiot, compared to Economists.
You are like the kid who just opened his first econ book in 7th grade, and im the slobbering idiot who's spent 15 years studying markets as a hobby.

Excellent reply my dude. Thanks.


Is that the operating cost in china, or averaged globally?


Except that is really outside the control of developers. You cannot create new users, you can only develop to try to create new *use cases* by creating new economy and hope that the transactional volume will follow. For example, LN creates the possibility for micro-transactions, which would be a new-ish (not new, but wasn't really feasible before either) use case.
Beyond that single example that I can think of, how would you propose to add more volume to the network? Its easier for a company to increase volume by extorting market inefficiencies, but in the case of bitcoin it does not really have so much competition in  its industry, so there is no competitor to leverage market share from. Sure, there are off-chain solutions and you could try to get more on-chain transactions, but I see that as a drop in the ocean type situation.


It was not my intention to straw man you, I merely misunderstood your intentions.


Which is why it would be on-chain and not through a payment channel. If the user needed to commonly use the channel, then the fee would justify the eventual savings the user would incur using the channel.


The system we were discussing was LN, not bitcoin. My old argument comment was directed towards that context. I do not think its a valid argument. The code is already done and the theory is sound, the question is whether the economics would play out favorably towards security. Im still on the fence about the issue.

You are not trusting mineres to not put back doors into their software?
You are not trusting miners to not collude to 51% attack the network?
These are things that we know are vulnerabilities within the social construct of the bitcoin network which is why we have always warned about these dangers. We cannot prevent human action from taking place, we can only try to reinforce the network with aligned economic incentives to dissuade actors from colluding or implementing harmful code, and what we cannot reinforce in code and incentives we must reinforce with social fabric.
Yet, actors are colluding, and actors are implementing harmful code.
The problem is that this actor is the only major manufacturer of hardware direct to consumers, and therefore has a advantage of being able to get away with non-justifiable behavior because we are  stuck with them.
This is a issue that cannot be fixed overnight.
But the worst thing we can do is pretend this is not a major threat to bitcoin. The worst thing we can do is engage in denialist behavior and deflect from reality. The worst thing we can do is bikeshed Bitmain's actions and pretend they are not just as catastrophic as they are.

To approach this question as rationally as possible, you would build a list of the most used exchanges, walllet providers and bridges (bitpay, coinbase etc).
You can measure economic activity from each entity by measuring trading volume or that business nodes activity.
You could then rank each entity by volume of activity to make a determination as to which entity creates more economic activity than the others and therefore build a hierarchical rank structure.
Note - I dont think any of this is necessary. You do realize the majority of exchanges and wallet providers etc have already upgraded to SegWit right?
And that these same businesses will run UASF to protect their investment? This is a snowball situation, once a few signal, the others will follow since it is within their best interests to do so. To not do so would be reckless as it would create potential for forks that will be fought under contentious terms.

I would like to comment on the 30-50% miners required to smoothly transition comment. AFAIK, the reason you dont need a majority of miners is because you just need enough hashing power to stave off an attack because if the economic majority is supporting it, these miners will be behaving against their economic self interests by attacking a profitable coin for a non-profitable coin and would only be able to do so for a limited time before they bankrupt themselves.
So this is why a majority is not needed. However, if there is a majority, then the path is very clear as it will be pointless to attack that chain.
I also would like to point out that SW currently has 30% of miners, BU 33%. So you can (and should) expect that 33% to attack the SW chain post UASF.
So I personally think that as we get closer, we will see a lot of currently sidelines miners switch to SW signaling as the threat of a 51% attack post UASF becomes a reality. A minority cannot attack the majority and have any chance of winning the battle if the economic majority is rejecting their blocks. There's a good chance they cant win the battle even with a clear majority, but it depends on how disruptive it is to the ecosystem and how that changes miners/exchanges/market participants actions under those circumstances. 
So, unless something drastic changes, I think that even if we stick to the current numbers of 30% vs 33% ....as long as the economic majority signals SW with UASF then there is very little risk of a successful chain split, meaning that there is a non-SW coin that forks and manages to get past difficulty adjustment.
40% signaling SW would guarantee a quick transition with little liklihood of a split, again assuming that the economic majority gets on board with UASF.
Everyone should understand that Bitmain will fight gnashing its teeth to the end. If you've not figured this out already, dont be naive about it. This guy is a threat to bitcoin and has proved so in stone over the last several months. He is no longer working in the users best interests and we need to fire him/force him to do whats right for bitcoin with UASF.
Users need to show the community that we are the economic actors within this market and therefore get to determine its path forward.

That was my thought as well, and there is also nothing stopping new-age "crypto-banks" from offering off-chain solutions to customers all while running a fractional reserve.
Fractional reserves are the bread and butter of financial organizations, so I see no reason that these things wont continue to exist in the bitcoin world as well.
Sure, we would all love everyone to be smart enough to not use these service providers, and instead use, on-chain, LN providers, whoever etc.
But when we step back into reality, we realize that once bitcoin becomes mainstream, the masses of non-technical people will be the majority and will not understand enough to care.

Champagne problems. Bitcoin is so successful that users now have to compete to get their transactions confirmed in the next 1-2 blocks. However they can opt to pay a much lower fee if their transaction is low priority and does not need to be confirmed within a hour or even a day. The transaction will fall out of memory within 3 days if a miner does not pick it up at that particular fee rate, or it can be "bumped" if the user has a compatible RBF/CPFP wallet by adding an additional fee to expedite its confirming.
If it falls out of memory it can be resubmitted with a more competitive fee.
All of these problems are resolved with the pending upgrade, SegWit, which adds capacity to the network and allows for true decentralized scaling to occur so that the lightning network can absorb additional growth without sacrificing bitcoins central security. 
This situation is made even more complex by the fact that some rich factions are purposefully gumming the bitcoin network by sending the same dust/bitcoin over and over, purposefully driving up fee rates and "clogging" the blockchain. These spam attacks have often occurred in sync with media publications that align with the "big block" theory that we must hard fork bitcoin to "fix" all of the problems.
So in short, there are people blocking the solution to the problem, and making the problem worse in an attempted power grab over bitcoins developmental structure.

So if all of core today gained consensus on lowering the blockcap size to 0.1mb, you think that would be acceptable?
Sorry, but that is just nuts and completely ignores so much. You are trying to simplify a very complex topic and its not a black and white situation.
When developers make a decision that *absolutely is a economic policy decision* then it needs to be characterized for exactly what it is. Core has stated many *many* times that it is merely a organization to provide software. 
Yet here they are making economic policy decisions that creates a artificial market. Sorry, but im going to call a spade a spade.

The question in context is, which is worse? A minority miner veto that stalls progress in bitcoin for political or non-community-benefit driven purposes? Or a soft fork that forces that minority to make a rational economic decision?
There's way too much context here to paint the situation as black and white as you did.


While you are looking into the future, could you tell me what the winning lottery numbers are tonight? Thanks.
You can accurately make that statement on July 31st, *if and only if* that is the case at that time. 
The question you should be asking yourself is ....
How many miners will signal SW when they start to realize that they will be unable to get paid, or paid at a steep discount for their non-SW minted coins? You are under-estimating the profit driven incentive of miners to do whats within their rational interests. Take a look at the BU token value vs BTC token value for a slim idea on what margin's miners are going to get on their non-SW blocks.
Bitmain was able to block progress while their covert asic-boost was  a secret, but now that its out of the bag and they know the community is rallying against them, do you think they will choose to bankrupt themselves instead?
They only have about a 5% signaling advantage against SW. Thats not very much when you consider how many miners are sitting on the sidelines not signaling anything right now. We have 30% of the market not signaling support for anything.
Do you think that 30% is going to risk being orphaned and losing some serious $$$ by going against the economic majority?
Game theory, plus historical examples (BIP66) imply that they will fall in line when they realize their profits are on the line.

Do'h! I had actually written this really long technical post about broadcast systems, walled gardens, relay network etc (as to why Roger is wrong)....and then realized he is technically correct (if you assume no usage of relay network). In my reformatting of the message I neglected to keep the relay network bit.
Yes, and not only that, but afaik, the relay network can be used on top of bitcoins broadcast system? So they would essentially still be able to receive and process broadcasted transactions on bitcoins broadcast system(input), and then propagate blocks (or receive them) through relay network.
So its doubly false, if I understand relay network correctly though admittedly I have not studied the network topology of it, so I may not be correct.

Excellent reply, thank you! I will bow out of the conversation and declare you the winner ;) You've demonstrated a lot of very valid points and you've gone a long way into making me believe that your analysis is factual and the points you've demonstrated are correct, at least in the context of nexus devices.
But, I think most of your points are only valid with current nexus devices. Which, if you look at market share, is not really that large. I would speculate, though I cant find documentation to back it up, that samsung likely has a larger market share. The galaxy series markets and sells very well.
I will still hold to my position that android phones without proper securing hardware, are more prone to attacking. I disagree about the replacing of boot chain to defeat encryption. You cannot do this with properly encrypted LUKS devices. I've looked into encrypting /boot in the past, and there appears to be pretty straight forward procedures to doing this. Even without encrypting your /boot, it would still not pose any attack vectors with proper crypto standards and passwords. You cannot mount a volume without the correct password no matter how much of the boot chain you inject/break.
I think the conversation is all relative to the average users length of security mechanisms. Obviously if you have a outdated linux desktop client and you are logging in as root with a weak crypto password, your device is breakable. But with proper encryption, patched software and non-root user desktop usage, the attack vectors you specified dont exist.
Which means that in those situations, those desktop clients are still more protected than the average android phone. Remember, current nexus devices are a very very small percentage of overall android phones in use, and we should not presume that anyone running wallet software on their droid is using a nexus 6p, or whatever the latest is.

Guys, this is clearly goal post shifting. They realized that they could not win the battle on LTC because its too centralized and a UASF would have destroyed them.
So now the narrative is changing to "Look what we accomplished with compromise on LTC! Now ~~can we~~ *we must* have a blocksize upgrade on BTC ~~too?~~!"
This ignores the fact that had they kept their antics up, ltc would have UASF'd the F outta them and they wouldn't have gotten their way.
So they did the best they could. They are trying to poison the well through central committee planning. They are attempting to create political precedent so that they can then accuse Core of not participating in "compromise" on things that need not be compromised.
Frankly I think it was a mistake and you should never negotiate with terrorists. They just compromised with the same people that were publicly obstructing SW activation on LTC for political reasons.

You've already made it clear you don't understand what core wants. You are in no place to dictate to anyone what core should do.
If after seeing how irrational some actors can be regardless of what's right for Bitcoin if you still think we can have a clean uncontested HF you are smoking good shit.
The problem with you and everyone else who holds this position is that you don't realize that irrational actors exist within the system and will work against the best interests of our community regardless of your perception.
In this core was right to be so persistent against hard forks. There needs to be a better upgrade mechanism which is why they've spent years researching ways to do it better.
SW buys us time for more research and testing and once there is a safe or mechanism we will use it to upgrade the block size only if it is needed.
Or should not negotiate with terrorists especially not terrorists who have shown that they do not have bitcoin's best interests at heart.

I not only think its encouraging, I think its *essential* to bitcoins future health. As the system stands right now we are allowing a minority group to control bitcoin. We've allowed this because we've done a poor job of analytics management as a community. We've failed to develop systems to measure support more broadly across all factions.
UASF re-aligns the power balance mechanism to give users the final say.
Those who naysay by saying you are merely trading miners control for exchange control dont realize the power that users have directly upon exchanges and wallet providers.
Users as it stands have absolutely no influence on miners. Their job sits above users in the "bitcoin ladder" of work, so we have little to no power to influence their decisions if they decide to collude against us.
But we do have direct control over which exchanges and wallets and fiat bridges (bitpay, coinbase etc) that we give our business to, and these businesses would be committing suicide to go against their uses wishes.
All UASF does is re-align the incentive structure to make the users wishes a dominant factor, and to diminish the "voting power" perception that we have disillusioned the miners with by giving them voting mechanisms like BIP9, but more specifically proposals that activate based solely upon BIP9 voting.
Its now being proven that miners are even less resilient than previously thought in regards to collusion, which makes them a poor party to put policy decision power into.
So UASF allows the users to have power to balance out the miners decision process. This works in the same way that the judicial system balances out the executive branch. 
The way I see it, there are 3 factions in bitcoin. The miners, the direct network users, and then Bitcoin Industry. These 3 factions have intersectionality in that in the middle, you can have all 3 groups be represented individually as network users or participants, but as a faction they exist in their own category, excluded from overlapping.
Using BIP9 as an activating mechanism by **only** measuring miner support is being proven as a failed management decision. I cannot really blame management on this one however since no one has a crystal ball and could have forseen that miners would abandon the users in the form of a monopoly (or at least not that it could have happened so quickly).
So we must re-address the balance by giving Bitcoin Industry (which are merely extensions for users) a voting mechanism to balance out any collusion effects from miners.

The real response is that your 6 months makes you a total newbie to the bitcoin scene. There's no way that you could understand the system the way that some of the more educated participants here do, or anywhere near as close as the developers, doctors, scientists and engineers understand it.
If you cannot understand the arguments, then you cannot make an appropriate decision as to which side has the better technical arguments.
So instead, you rely upon laymen interpretation. Whats surprising to me, is that you cannot just go visit right now, look at the comments, and not see the spew of negativity, hatred, conspiracy theories and fear mongering.
Anyone who cannot see what is obviously there, I immediately suspect as being a sock puppet, shill or just a fucking idiot.

Boom. The truth is apparent. You are obviously correct, but I think what is happening is philosophy is getting in the way of rational discourse. Bram is obviously *so* hyperfocused on decentralization that he is ignoring data. Also, one would point out that Bram is not a econ major and I would say that studying the fee market is not his speciality. 
Rest assured, he *does* have a brilliant mind and everyone knows it, but I've not seen anyone dispute the economics behind the fee market *existing without a cap*.
Also, the problem is belcher is arguing about future theory, instead of focusing on *the current*. The current is a 25btc subsidy, and to be cut to 12 btc this year. Can anyone rationally argue that even if *we lost one third of our mining power today* that we are in fear of a outside attack? The recent LTC halving showed no effect on hashpower or price, and with most of the hashing in china I would speculate the same will happen to bitcoin. 
If we can afford to loose plenty of security (though I strongly doubt that will happen) and still be safe, then why this whole "lets rush to enable a fee market NOW" argument?
People who advocate using artificial blocks (and core playing economic policy dictator) to *force* the fee market *to change from the current form of its free market economics* are just as insane as the people who *are advocating for a immediately deployed HF with a short cutoff time*.
Both sides are insane and extreme and not using factual data for debate.

I understand this, which is why i run a full node.
But to assume that today you cannot get away without running a full node *as a user* is speculation not founded on any evidence. 100's of thousands of people do it and do not run into any issues. Bitcoin is obviously decentralized *enough* that node operators around the world are fulfilling their duties and full blockchains are available for validation.
I think you are sensationalizing the issue beyond what is rational and should tone your wild claims down to a more realistic level.
What you want is good. We all want a maximum decentralized network...but implying that things are not what they are is not the appropriate way to do it. You are trying to use irrational fear into goading people to run nodes when at this time and point its simply not neccessary to do so for *users*. Businesses who wish to operate in the space as payment providers, or other operators that require more extensive validation resources obviously must run a node or risk being frauded.
But this is how the free market works. Those businesses if they fail to run a node and get defrauded to the point that they can no longer operate were simply weak and will be eroded out of the market.

So you are saying that 3rd party warrant canary's are useless? Isn't that kind of against what you are preaching? You said in the other thread that was good advice, but now you create non-realistic hypothetical scenario's in which your own advice is invalidated?
You [said]( ..


Well, if said threat of violence can force you to update a canary, or forcibly have a friend update it then whats the point? 
Besides the fact that you threw out all logic to make that statement, lets go through it anyways. I already addressed the issue. You provide the keys to a unknown/unpublicized 3rd party (friend) to update the canary for you on the condition that so long as you contact him regularly and tell him to do so, he will update it for you. You do not have the keys, he does. You cannot force him to update the canary if present conditions are not met and neither can the court without knowing who he is. Thats kind of the point and you ignored that conveniently. You create conditions ahead of time such as having two email accounts you send the update to. You must send the email to both accounts for it to be updated and if one mail is missing then it should not be updated.
Then, if you *are* forced by the court to contact your 3rd party to update it, you comply with the order and send the email to have it updated to only one account. Either way, since your friend is not known and not under court order, he will not update since the conditions are not met. You can say with full legal compliance that you did as asked and cannot be held in contempt of court as you can provide evidence. His email can be anonymous, they cannot comply a non-treaty zone email provider to comply with a US warrant.
Either way, this is all a aside. Its just the technical details of how a canary *could* work under duress and still does not address the greater issue of action vs *inaction*. 


For a "security" guy you seem awfully dense. You couldn't even read my message in full and understand the details, and we are supposed to trust you with our security. Uh huh :P

That got me thinking. It would be great if when you sign up for your wallet, that there is a multisig escrow wallet thats setup specifically for fee bumping, where you can escrow a dollar or so for algorithm based fee-bumping. The wallet could monitor confirmations and fee rates for the transactions submitted through its services, and then auto fee bump if your fee bump escrow has funds and you've configured your settings to do so.
Of course, this might not ever be necessary with LN getting off the ground, and its a centrist custodian approach towards a issue, but sometimes we should make limited sacrifices for efficiency.

If we measure outputs instead of transactions we can account for batching. I am unfamiliar with any measurement metrics in regards to lightning Network or how we can extrapolate them to include them into output numbers on the mansion.
so while the current all-time high of transactions is around 490k, you can see that when you account for outputs it's almost double.

if you add in lightning Network and side chains I'm pretty sure that we are doing a million a day? Very close if not.

Since you seem genuinely perplexed here, let me help you.
Your first post was assinine and a faulty premise. Many, many *many* people have gotten rich off bitcoin, and will continue to get rich off bitcoin. Im personally more stoked on the financial soverignty aspect of bitcoin and don't see it as a get rich scheme, but that doesn't mean that others don't, and that they don't succeed. 
So in this, you are factually incorrect, which in itself is enough to deserve the downvotes because ....
and this is the second reason you've been so heavily downvoted....
You come across as a assumptive angry asshole. Now, bear in mind im not saying you are an asshole, but judging by the negativity and faulty assumptions, and your second reply that was just exuding *anger*, I would lean closer to you *are* actually a bitter salty little asshole, but I could not possibly know for sure until I've met you in person.


I don't know whats wrong with anyone else, but I've quite adequately described whats wrong with your *behavior*. So maybe you should reflect a little bit, take a look in the mirror ...**but most importantly...**
Calm. Down.
Seriously, doesn't it make you feel like shit when you just stir the pot and write angry shit all the time? I've been there and done that enough, I know exactly how detrimental it is to my health.
So smoke some weed brother, you really really need it. Do some yoga, meditate, listen to the dark side of the moon, whatever calms you down and makes you reflect and not write angry shitposts on reddit.
Third - I highly doubt this is your first 9 days on reddit. So either this is your sock puppet troll account, or you've mistreated others so poorly you felt so much shame you abandoned your first/second/millionth account.
If you've got mental issues, see a doctor. But calm down, you are only making yourself look bad. 


Thanks redditor of 9 days. Got proof? Im pretty sure you know nothing about me, when (or even if) I've purchased bitcoin. I can tell you that I was browsing bitcointalk in 2012, so there's that, you can take it anyway you please. Feel free to assume you're "right" and that you've "won" here, no one really cares.

Except when that "data" is replaced by real-world actions.
Yesterday a friend sent a transaction out with a .0001 fee, which should be more than enough for the current metrics, yet it took almost 2 hours to confirm because -
1) Miners had a bad luck run and it took a hour to find a block
2) The first miner to find the block couldn't fit all the transactions in the block (because 1mb limit), and the next block found didn't include that many transactions, so it took the 3rd block *after* the tx was sent with a appropriate fee to get the transaction confirmed.
This friend was not dealing with a 0-confirm provider, so he had to wait 2 hours in order for the service to become functional.
But I guess we should just ignore the fact that the *only reason* his transaction was delayed was because the block was filled and couldn't be included. And when the fee is not enough, now he has to wait a few days for the tx to fall out of the mempool? And he has to be a tech-wizard and manually craft the transaction since the wallet already thinks the funds are spent?
This shit is *not ok*.
I understand that sometimes miners have bad luck and blocks are not found, and theres no assignation of blame going on there. But for the transaction to take a additional *2 blocks* to be included *only because blocks are full* is fucking bullshit and you know it.

We can agree on that point *partially*. What we may not agree on is the fact that there actually *is* a fix for it already that has been in the works for 3 years. Its called "Lightning Network" and it economically incentivizes nodes to operate on its network, fixing the unaligned incentive issue with bitcoin.
Also, it is not a design flaw. Nodes, when the whitepaper was released (hence design) were equal to miners. There was no such thing as a non-mining-node. So the design was for miners to be nodes since one cpu = one vote (in the design). So they absolutely were economically incentivized to run a node. Also, businesses that accept bitcoins should run nodes the same way that a gold business should be checking the validity of the gold he buys through counterfeit checking, which is in itself an economic incentive to run a node.
What the design did not account for was the divergence from one cpu  = one vote with the creation of mining pools and eventually ASIC manufacturing. This is not such much a "design flaw" as it was just not having a crystal ball that see's the future. Im sure that you are more brilliant than satoshi and think you could have done better though right?
Saying "we need to fix it" is not helpful. All it does is highlight that you dont understand the complexity involved in validating fullnodes. There is currently no such mechanism to validate fullnodes that is not susceptible to sybil attacks.

The reason why he did not supply any evidence is because this is such a basic fundamental Common Sense thing that no one would ever be asked to provide evidence. This is akin to you asking for the mathematical proof that one plus one equals two. It does exist and I believe it's 316 pages long, but that's a ridiculous request and every participant here knows it.
But if you want your proof you'll have to do the research and the digging yourself because the proof does exist. When the block reward switched from 50 to 25 BTC there were quite a few miners that patched their software to create 50 BTC blocks even though the halvening had already occurred. These miners were quickly orphaned off the Blockchain​ onto their own fork and they very quickly switched back to the unpatched software with the 25 BTC reward.
The reason this is a common sense item is because miners are for-profit entities if they cannot make a profit on their work then they don't work. We would only have to explain this to someone who has the most absolutely newbie to this scene which it looks like you are.

You seem to not understand what engineering tradeoffs are. That is exactly the case in most situations, though its not "problems" so much as it is simply costs and benefits.
There are always costs and benefits, and making changes will change the relationship between these costs and benefits. These changes are evaluated based on the merit of the benefit, and the addition or reduction of cost. If there is too much debt and not enough benefit, then the idea does not hold water. Things like "EC", "Extension blocks" and the like are good examples of things that greatly increase debt but offer very little engineering advantages to the system.
You seem incapable of rationalizing this and it feels like you are just here to shit on things that you have already demonstrated you dont understand.

Because the "person" who is being "attacked" in this situation has not resorted to technical facts or arguments and is a business, not just a individual. You can't have this both ways.
Roger staked his reputation on vouching for Mt Gox. If you think that his intent was to not vouch for Mt Gox, then what was he doing? You are trying to use semantics to create a red herring to distract from reality.
The **only** purpose of Roger's Mt Gox claims were to assure the community that "everything is ok". If you are going to deny this then you should not even be trying to participate in the discussion because you are living in a alternative fantasy reality where we pretend common sense things are not true.


Rogers assurance that he "looked into Mt Gox and everything seems ok" resulted in investor confidence during what was supposed to be a bank run. He directly added to the misleading conclusion that Mt Gox was not having problems when they were having problems.
Instead, Roger should have been advising everyone to remove their assets until a professional audit could be done.
Roger made a mistake and risked his reputation on that mistake. Now, roger is doing the same thing again, and **again** its turning out that he is colluding with the worst people in the space. Maybe Mark K is totally innocent and was just a bumbling idiot, but that does not take away liability, nor does it take away Rogers involvement with what became the largest liability issue of all time in the bitcoin ecosphere.
Now here he is at it again, **again** defending Bitmain when Bitmain has clearly gotten caught in multiple malicious acts. Roger is obviously a poor judge of the situation and his reputation has been greatly diminished because of his continued advocacy of malicious actors within the bitcoin space.
Roger is a entity and he needs to be attacked specifically because he is acting beyond the scope of his personal self. He is using bitcoin.com as a propaganda machine against the best interests of the community and is colluding with 9 figure chinese cabals who are hellbent on monopolizing the industry.
And he justifies it how? Because these people say they want big blocks?
Roger has engaged in clear cognitive dissonance by refusing to acknowledge that Bitmain has a anti-competitive monopolistic $$$$$ reason to want big blocks and it has nothing to do with big blocks and everything to do with preventing the upgrading of the bitcoin network which would invalidate their chinese patented asicboost and prevent them from further monopolizing the industry.
If Roger was just Roger then I might agree with you. But he's not. He's a pool operator and multiple domain and multiple social media platform operator who has made it a war to infiltrate and spread propaganda for his ideological perspective.
You are a limp banana bruce and you are supporting the wrong side. When there are clear malicious actors with resources in the space you *must* stand strong against them or they will prevail. Grassroots resistance is the only way that the people can stand up against specialized interest groups. Bitmain is clearly a malicious specialized interest group and Roger has made it his personal war to support them because they support his cause.
If we allowed this kind of behavior we would all be wading through dick picks on a 20mb blockchain right now that could only be hosted on datacenters. If we allowed the Gavin mentality to propagate we would no longer have a decentralized bitcoin. The fight must be at a social level because who else is going to stand up for the little guys? Fortunately we have a slew of core developers who appear to be ideologically aligned with a anti-state perspective who have applied proper game theory and understand the long term risks we face.
We do not sacrifice security for short term profit. 
Right now we need motherfucking Spartans not limp bananas trying to play peacemaker. After **years** of having the same stupid debate and having the other side refuse technical arguments, do you really think they are suddenly going to change their tune and start listening to facts?
You are just as naive as Roger if you think there's a chance of that happening now. I thought asicboost and antbleed would have turned the tide, but as you can see they are still in full retard mode denying water is wet.

[Read to understand](




Consider that you have three unspent outputs in your wallet, two of 0.5 BTC and one of 1 BTC. Someone requests a payment from you for 0.75 BTC. As of today, a typical wallet will attempt to minimize fees and split the 1 BTC output to send 0.75 BTC to your recipient and create a change address. They do so because under the current protocol, it takes more bytes to spend a transaction than to split a transaction and therefore is more expensive. From the perspective of the network though, combining the 0.5 BTC outputs (using two inputs) is preferable because it defrags the UTXO set.*


I know....Lots of words, but you should spend more time reading and researching the topics instead of shitposting.


You should really look up these definitions before you use them. When you try to rebuttal with words that you don't understand it just ends up making you look stupid.

I bolded the important part for you. But this is used incorrectly so commonly on this sub that my mind is blown. Appeal to Authority when you are actually appealing to experts on this athority is not a fallacy.

Quoting experts within the field is not an appeal to Authority fallacy. That's called common sense and these f****** idiots like you who do this shit spread anti-intellectualism with your brazen stupidity.

And this is really one of my bigger concerns. LN is supposed to be the model that scales bitcoin cheap and effectively. But if the security model requires large risk, then the economic model would require compensation for that risk.
So far, no one has alleviated my fears and I feel like LN will run into a few possible scenarios -
1) Hubs are constantly attacked, threatening the *trust* in the network
2) Hubs who are not hacked gain higher favorability, which results in centralization
3) Hubs who are resilient against attacks will reasonably ask for higher fees, because they have a economic incentive to do so. If they are more popular/more secure, then certainly it is reasonable to ask for more.
4) This evolution creates a situation in which we may see not-so-cheap as expected LN fee's
Of course, this is all just speculation and theory, but its important to analyze these things prior to throwing out the bathwater and going all in on LN being "the scaling solution" for bitcoin. Theres no backup plan right now, everyone is hoping this works.

In a lot of ways I have seen it be more of an ideological interference then it is a benefit. Problem with being an economist is that your views are incumbent upon Dogma, Dogma that has polarized you're thinking. Let us not forget that Bitcoin is the opposite of the incumbent Financial system so it only stands that entrenchment upon your previously sustained economic views will only lead to irrational objection of Bitcoins system.
The human brain has evolutionized on the principle of avoiding adversial risk to sustain safety. Is very difficult for humans to radicalize their thinking in a way that challenges the "stable" status quo because our brains kind of freak out about it  as a risk on a neurological level which prevents deep constructive and open thoughts.

Problem is not with the technology itself but with the hidden form being utilized in a monopolistic force that creates over 70% of the hardware in the market.
This company basically sells crippled versions of its Hardware to its customers at a premium while retaining a secret optimized version for itself that gives it a 20 to 30% advantage.
Considering that investing in Bitcoin is actually historically more profitable than Mining and with mining being a low-margin business to be disadvantaged from the go from your own supplier in a highly competitive Global Market is at the least highly unethical and in a lot of countries illegal I would imagine.
This has enormous implications upon the mining economy in general however and how that affects Bitcoin is a very serious cause for concern. With an advantage it's easy for one force who already has a monopoly to take over market share. We have a reasonable amount of proof that bitmain is comprised of multiple pools so they're hashrate seems to be quite scarily closer to 51% than any of us would or should want. And with such a dramatic Competitive Edge in a low-margin market this makes squeezing out other miners that much more easy.
Don't forget that they've already made their money selling those machines so by squeezing the competition out by giving them inferior hardware and holding on to optimized Hardware they are creating a double-edged sword where they f*** customers on one end and then f*** them again on the other end.
To reiterate the public variant of this optimization is actually not an issue because it's so easily discoverable. The problem is when you have a hidden form of it where one force can Corner the market secretly While disadvantaging others. the proof of work algorithm is designed to be computationally intensive in a way that restricts advantage. A ton of research has been put into ASIC-proof proof of work algorithms to prevent exactly this kind of behavior. So please understand that this is a design implementation that begin from the very start. So we cannot claim that this is a move to change the Dynamics of mining in any way from the original design.
To further demonstrate good faith, this the patch released fixes the hidden form but not the public form. All it does is try to resolve the advantage that won Monopoly has created so as to not disadvantaged the rest of the world and further increased centralization effects. That seems both fair and professional considering the original design implementation is designed to prevent exactly this kind of competitive advantage.

So how do we scale the transactional capability into the *trillions* so that people around the world can buy both houses and coffees?
Do we do it by redistributing the resource costs on the altruistic node operators, destroying them literally overnight and wiping out all decentralization?
Or do we design a system that re-aligns economic incentive for node operators so that the fundamental decentralization properties of the system (and its security) are retained?

I feel that things can be just as bad, and worse, when you are face to face. Emotions run high and people can just as easily  falsely interpret a vocal statement as a written one.
When things are written, you have a endless amount of time to digest and respond. This allows for more careful discourse. Hopefully this is not the case and the dev's can all play nicely at the meet up and can get shit done :)

For non-wireless/docsis options, I now cannot get anything *less than 60mbit* in my home, where just a few years ago I had a 10mbit connection. And thats on a *analog copper line*, without even using fiber. With the FCC now on consumers sides, with cities installing their own fibers and competition opening up we are going to see gbit as home consumer speeds in the next few years, which is actually *beyond* neilson's law.
[Neilsons law]( is still in effect all over the world, which states 50% annualized growth. I've actually seen *more* than that in my metropolitan area in california. And the USA is actually quite *low* on the global bandwith ranking, where we are [currently ranked 17th in the world](
With 4d/5d stacking nano-technology, we are creating *tiny* discs now that are 360TB and [last 13 billion years](
Im sorry man, I dont know what shitty echo chamber you've got yourself stuck in, but anyone who says that moore's law or neilsons law are not in effect clearly are not educated on the massive advancements in technology we are constantly making.
I think you are confusing the semiconductor industry who uses transistors where they have finally [started to approach the laws of physics on transistors]( Its easy to take one single industry and to assume that it applies to all, but obviously that is not true.
We are also making vast improvements in bio-computing and using non-metal compounds such as [photonic computing chips]( which will replace the analog transistors we are currently using.
Once you know these things, you can clearly see that moore's law is still in effect. And when technologies start to reach their optimal limits, such as the transistor industry, then there is always going to be bright minds designing new technologies to replace those.
In long, the basis of your argument is false. Your assertion that bitcoin cannot scale because technology cannot scale with it is absolutely false and entirely naive.

You have no comprehension of regulation and how that interferes with free market? 
In this case, the "free market" is the fee market that exists without artificial influence (otherwise known as regulation). Putting a capsize on the block space is a regulation of the asset (block space). It artificially constrains the size, which prevents free market principals from determining what the optimum space is.

You have entirely missed the point of bitcoin. It is a enabler of modern finance for countries that are firewalled off by the banking establishment.
*This* is bitcoins "killer app". Remittance, and connecting emerging economies to the global hub of commerce.
These things are not possible if we use elitist attitudes like yours and apply it systemically. Which is *exactly* what core devs are doing right now by artificially limiting block space.
Im a fan of LN, and I cannot wait to see the advancements it helps bring, but im sure you've heard the saying "dont put your eggs in one basket"....this is always true, under any circumstance. Bitcoin needs *both* LN and on-chain capacity to flourish. It would be *plain stupid* to bet all your money that LN will be the catch-all-solve-all of everything. This is not even mentioning that LN does not take the load off bitcoin. It still needs to have much extra added blockspace capacity to deal with all the payment channels that will be opening and closing.

Yes, I was trying to figure out what the "unknown" was, and why it was being used in the count. 
Ultimately there could be only 100 nodes, but if 10 of those hundred are major exchanges and wallet providers then that would be enough. Others would quickly upgrade when they realized their nodes were doing pointless work for a stale chain.

Miners are equivalent to market participants. They have a commodity in which they need to sell on an open market. 
They do not control the economic activity of bitcoin. They contribute to it yes, by selling the coins they mint to the market, but that makes then participants within the economy similar to buyers or sellers.
This makes them "users" most definitely, as they are part of the economy.
But the economic majority? No. Again, Exchanges, Wallets providers and Fiat bridges. These are the entities that control economic activity from a transactional basis. Miners participate in that process but at the end of the day, it is those who control the choke points of the money that ultimately control bitcoin. And the users who can bankrupt these entities based on their business decisions are the ones who exert control over these entities. This means that miners are in the same group as users, in that they have a voice, but their voice is on a different part of the ladder than exchanges, for example.

Its been beat to death already. That you act like you still dont know the facts is not cool. I see you post a lot so im sure you've read the facts many times.
At most we will see 1.7mb increase when *everyone* utilizes SW style tx's (for non-P2SH tx's, which is 90+% of the current usage). This is assuming 100% adoption. Assuming 100% adoption is irrational and even the core dev's are not doing that. Call it excessive exuberance if you would like, either way its a fantasy to think that we can go into 100% adoption short term. The same developers cry wolf over hard forks even with 90% of the community already reaching consensus on a 2mb upgrade, so to go the opposite and to claim that we can achieve a majority switchover on not just node software, but all software *makers* themselves short term is nothing more than a fantasy pumpers dream. 
 
There has been analysis done from many well respected members of the community, and even sipa said himself on IRC that short term he agreed with the analysis that we could be as low as 1.3.... not 1.7 and definitely NOT 2mb. We would only see 2mb with higher utilization of P2SH, which there is no economic catalyst for so there is not much reason we should see any dramatic increase in the utilization of P2SH, as big as a fan as I am of the technique. 
1.3 is just *not enough* considering we are already peaking and tx load is increasing steadily. Im not running around screaming fire. No one is on fire. But we will be in a very short while and while core developers are great at developing technology, they have stated it is not their position to dictate economic policy.
By refusing to release the pressure when this issue has been beat to death they are playing economic policy dictators.
That is *not* cool.
And dont try to bandwagon or create camps over the issue. Im pro-SW and its wonderful and I cant wait to see it intergrated in bitcoin. But short term its not the pressure release we need. There's literally been zero evidence provided for negative consequences for a 2mb upgrade, the issue has been debated to death and nothing has come  out other than fear mongering over HF network splits, which *wont happen with a economic and market majority already declaring consensus for 2mb*.

Im not naive. I understand how the system works. Yet there are plenty of examples demonstrated and working today that prove what you are writing is just a stinky pile of crap.
The whole world is not subverted. There will be jurisdictions prone to corruption that will face uphill protracted legal battles with the incumbents lobbying to craft legislation that favors them and disables their opponents capabilities.
And then there will be plenty of success stories.
The only naivety here is your insistence of all things negative. The world is not falling. Its improving. Get your facts straight, think positive and move forward and do good in the world.


I am representing a philosophy that has been present in bitcoin since the beginning. Surely you are not suggesting that the *global* financial system, bitcoin, is meant to *not* work for the poor? Last time I checked in order for a global system to be global, it has to work .....*globally*, which includes 3rd world countries.
As the white paper stated, bitcoin is a p2p system that bypasses the traditional financial institution. Did you think satoshi meant for bitcoin to only be p2p in 1st world countries? 


payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a
financial institution. 
And understanding these basic premises, do you think that bitcoin, used globally, will *not* have a multiplying effect on market cap? Basic economics can answer that for you.
@_date: 2016-02-22 02:47:10


I agree with you that we should wait to reserve any hasty judgement on consensus and core planning until official notice, but it would be naive to not recognize that some of the most conservative members of core were present and agreed with the proposed path forward.
This is clearly a political process, but also a process that will echo within cores chambers and traction will be likely, since the most conservative dev's are sold.
Im a little confused with all the back and forth that has been going on lately. There's a faction that is really representative to the fact that we need a scheduled hardfork, but now that we are seeing the formation of that proposal, we now have a faction thats decreeing that consensus is not derived from people sitting in one room.
I actually beg to disagree on a basic psychological fundamentalism with social behaviors. Clearly there is a large faction that is going to follow core without any regard to the path forward, so long as it is not *extreme*. This would be the conservative faction that has an appeal to authority that will support anything that comes out of the satoshi github repository. I would state with consideration for bias that this faction has fundamental justification for this behavior, considering the history of core and its well respected members. Its a impressive list, and quite diverse with a lot of counter-opposing ideas within. This is *good*. I would like to see Gavin, Jeff continue to work within core because the balancing of ideas is important and its *really* important that there be contrasting views for the health of the ecosystem.
Meaning that anything that core proposes, we will see a majority of the users support it by default, so long again, as its *not extreme*. This means that while full consensus is not built within a room, it has a strong influence to creating consensus industry wide through the microphone piece (satoshi github/core).
The analogy is akin to the white house. The president, while he does have veto and executive orders, he cannot change the outcome of congress (miners) except *by the means of using the whitehouse as a propaganda platform to build rapport with the citizens of the nation*. With these citizens being the constituents in a representative democracy, this is a 2nd layer approach to try to influence congress by proxy through the people. Now I understand that we can go into complexities like representatives not doing what the constituents want (miners ignoring users) but I think for the most part the users have the ultimate power as the final say (I will use this software or I will use a different software). Further, users have the power to vote out both congress and the president *at any time*, which is a improvement on the representative-democracy model in comparison here.
Core is in a similar position where their platform allows them a advantage to build consensus by vocalizing their support, which comes in the form of software releases, core issued statements with signatures, or the ACK process on the devlist signaling strong support for issues.
I would say that the establishment (core), is already a political party by default, even if they dont try to be. Even if you would disagree with this ideology, I think its ultimately clear that they are *at least* a central planning committee that is influenced the same as all humans are.
And I think this recent "consensus" is a transparent example of this political process and how the final result is molded by it, regardless of what it may be.
And I think those who wanted the HF need to be happy with the compromise, and that core should *really* hope that the blocksize limit is not hit, creating a artificial market that prices some users out or frustrates people into moving to another software system, be it bitcoin or a altcoin. This would also cause another HF war with alternative clients offering to "fix" the situation by raising the limit.
With all that said, I think gavin is merely expressing his frustration at the political process, by recognizing it for exactly what it is - a political process/central planning committee. And if they can decide these things, then they can decide these other things, right?
I hope that lukejr builds a solid platform for the future HF proposals so that we have better consensus logic in the future, and less political process. I think he would agree its a threat to the system, same as dwindling decentralization is.

The fuller quote -




if virtual shells weren't flying overhead-- or otherwise there is an incentive to keep them flying 24/7. Internet drama is remarkably cheap
to generate. **"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself".**


disruption: astroturf enough drama up that Bitcoiners "sacrifice correctness" themselves right off a cliff in a futile attempt to make it go away. :)
I couldn't fit all of it in the title, but I thought that these were really wise words from Greg and a stark reminder of where we are today.
The bullshit propaganda only works if we let it work. It only works if we *absorb* the fear and allow it to dictate actions.
I have repeatedly stated "We do not deal with terrorists" and this could not be more true today, and will continue to be even more important in the future.
We cannot allow a minority of specialized interest groups infect our hearts and minds with misinformation designed to create fear. Bitcoins future depends upon this resilience. 
The best way to inoculate ourselves against this misinformation is to stay informed and to counter with factual information.
And while we've seen that those entrenched refuse to see facts, we must constantly remember that those who are so deeply entrenched that they cannot see the tree's for the forest are not a threat to bitcoin. They are a very very small minority and cannot dictate majority actions within bitcoin unless we allow them to poison our hearts and minds to fight their fight for them.
My position on UASF is still the same. If we can onboard the vast majority of economic players (exchanges, wallets, fiat bridges) then we can move forward with minimal disruption.
However if we cannot, then there is no point. It appears to me that there is not enough economic support building, though time will tell us more in the future.

I think that we cannot rely upon ideological rationalization to explain what is now being proven to be an economically driven agenda.
Once the evidence is out in the open, we cannot ignore the economic incentive that this advantage has given bitmain. We also cannot ignore the fact that they have been utilizing it by mining empty blocks.
I think there is ample evidence at this point to say with no reasonable doubt that bitmain is fully implicated in attempting to sabotage progress to protect their monopolistic behaviors.
To presume otherwise at this point seems naive. These are economically driven actors, and what do you always hear? "Follow the Money" ....right?
Well the money led us to this. Its as clear as day whats going on here.
There is literally no way to prove the other side. What are we going to do, ask Jihan if this was always ideologically driven, and then accept his answer as "proof" ???

Yes, of course. You'll notice that my statement "we need" is contextually in future tense, meaning that it is the actions that are being sought right now that are going to have implications to make my statement true.
When the artificial blocksize cap causes blocks to be artificially full, a artificial fee market is created. No one argue's against this, every participant here and developer agree's with that statement. When block size fills, it creates economic pressure.
As soon as that occurs (as it has occurred in the past), fee's will rise. As fee's rise, we are pricing out the poor. Right now it costs roughly 2 cents to send a dollar through the blockchain. When a artificial fee market is created, that number will obviously rise.
Do you really think that the poor have *any* amount of money to loose? 
The question at hand is where is the balance between security and cost. We have so much hashing power right now that there is no chance of any attack. We could loose 70% of the mining equipment of the world to a fire right now and we would still not be in any fear of attack.
So rationalizing that we need more hashing power is a irrational position. We clearly do not need more security *at this moment*, just like we are not in any fear of the halving causing any major security implications. Considering we have LTC's havling to look to, they did not loose *any* hashing power at the halving. Speculation is that chinese mining equipment is operating on zero or near zero cost for electricity and that they will continue to mine through several halvings through the life of the mining equipment as their cost is not any greater due to low cost electricity.
So arguing that we should develop a fee market when we are clearly not in need of any security is not only irrational, its intentionally obscuring the real issue. The real issue is about decentralization, not hashing power, and a small blocksize raise has been proven through much analysis to have no impact on current node count. 
This is why segwit is being deployed, because it is believed by core that a 2-4mb raise will not effect node count to any dangerous level.
So, playing economic policy *dictator* by imposing artificial monetary policy is creating a economic event that changes the economy of bitcoin.
Thats *not* cool, and its not cool for *many* reasons, just *one* of the being that it unfairly prices out poorer people around the world from participating on the market. They do not have *any* amount of money to lose.
TLDR - let the free market continue to develop the fee market, as satoshi himself originally intended.

That read a little difficult. Are you trying to say that the collective value of coffee purchases globally do deserve security?
If that is the case, I would disagree. This is not about collective security, but individual security. You risking a few dollars is not a problem. You risking your life savings is. Blockchains are inefficient and expensive. Its hard enough to secure everyones money, even harder (exponentially) to secure micro amounts both cheaply and efficiently.
Fortunately, there's a network called Lightning Network that will allow everyone to have both the cheap and quick (0-conf) coffee transactions they want.

That would explain the uptick in price. Even though its on LTC it has serious considerations for long term signaling support on BTC.

They can, but doesn't UASF which is activated by nodes, who only enforce SW-compatible blocks, which therefore would make miners who produce old blocks forked off the network? This presumes the economic majority runs UASF nodes and therefore rejects those old blocks produced by non SW miners.

Yes, and a normal hotwallet is extremely risky. Thats like putting your wallet inside a box, with a chain attached to the box wrapped around a pole on your property and then placing the box on the sidewalk.
People cannot steal the funds in the wallet, but with enough diligence, they can break into the box and take the funds. No box is secure from critical vulnerabilities like the ones discussed.
Right now we have very large professional companies with strict hot wallet policies that prevent funds from being stolen. If this model is replaced by "the average joe", surely you could see there being major security ramifications?
I understand the answer to this is "dont keep large funds in your hotwallet", but I think that if that is the answer then we need more education and discussion on this topic publicly.
Also, that does not apply to hubs with large hotwallet balances.

No, thats not "whats left" of his argument, *that was his argument*. He never said that the chinese miners would band together to 51% attack the network and you are putting words in his mouth. Im sure he would appreciate it if you wouldn't do that.
The fact that you just made that all up makes me wonder where all these grandiose idea's came from. Your assumption that he does not understand miner economics stems from your misrepresentation of his words and thoughts.
And by the way, I agree with him. I think its a absolutely horrible precedent to have the majority of the network exist behind a firewall controlled by a dictator who at any whimsical moment might decide to take action.
If you've not been following chinese economics then you would be naively unafraid of such drastic actions that are totally realistic and within arms reach.
People who live in 1st world countries and do not study history really have no idea what is possible by irrational (or perhaps very rational) dictators who are trying to control outcomes.

That is correct, this was started with a large buy order executed. I've not looked to see what exchange by timestamp was the first purchaser, but I saw at a glance that the buy was over 1000 btc on various exchanges. You can expect exchanges with higher volume to have larger buys because the books are thicker, with less effect on price, and similarly the opposite for exchanges with less liquidity, people are mostly looking to trade and profit, not spike the price above its relative threshold comparatively to other exchanges, e.g. if bitstamp spikes to 600, someone on kraken might only buy 1/3rd as much to get it to spike   to that same 600 since the books are thinner (less sell orders outstanding between 570 and 600).


Mostly bots, but some amount of human interaction too I would imagine. Im not so positive on traders allowing their bots to make 500+ btc purchases, that seems like it would spell disaster to me allowing your bots that kind of power. I would think that very large purchases are human interactions, but im not a day trader so im not 100% certain. Arbitrage opportunities open up as soon as there are market gaps, so there are going to be bots working across multiple exchanges that are positioning orders to best take advantage of those gaps, organically creating movements in a direction.


This one I can positively answer as "bots". If you just watch the order books at any exchange for a few minutes on sites like bitcoinwisdom, you will see that there is a distinct pattern of bots constantly shuffling orders for small amounts, placing them, removing them, replacing them 1 cent lower, etc. If a human (or bot) puts in a order thats higher than market value but lower than the current highest sell bid (the bottom of the top column), you will see bots immediately shuffling orders for less than 1 btc to be 0.01/0.001/0.0001 right beneath that bid just placed, so that its attempting to put down pressure on the price. Similarly, this happens in reverse with the buy orders, with bots wanting to build upward momentum putting a slightly higher buy bid, which balances the market out. For every action there is a opposite reaction eh? The market moves when the equilibrium goes one way or another because of X reason.
So when a large buy order executes, it fulfills all of those sellers orders between 570 and 600, then there is definitely a vacuum where there are not very many orders at all between 570 and 600 as they just got eaten (like the langoliers!). But what happens is the bots immediately start shuffling in tons of orders, filling the books. If you catch it right when it happens, you'll see how there is very little volume of btc on the books on the numbers to the right that go in $5 dollar increments, and then over 15-30 minutes you'll see it magically fattens itself up as people position themselves either manually or automatically through their bots.
But the truthful answer is "nothing" other than perhaps psychology. Anyone with any amount of money could immediately choose to sell right after a big buy.  This strategy is called "contrarian" and its about going the opposite direction of the market, or what is the majorities mindset. This can actually work out very well, especially if you or a group of buyers coordinate with enough money against the market. This is how we get things called "short squeezes", where a large group of people are trying to short (perhaps with leverage) the price, and then the order books build with those shorts. You can see the amount of these shorts by looking at the lending $ amounts on various exchanges statistics. When enough builds, you could plausibly say that the market thinks the price will go down because a large amount of people have bet that the price goes down.
Well, if you have enough money yourself or with a group, you could all simultaneously execute buy orders, which would at a certain % (stop loss), cause those shorted orders to auto-execute (buy back), which then triggers *other* short sellers who might have started at a lower price point to trigger, and so on and so on until it organically balances out due to thresholds no longer being triggered (money ran out), and this is called a [cascade]( where you see multiple bars each going lower than the others, or higher if its a short squeeze.  


Same here! Would you believe I've learned all of this through bitcoin and im not even a trader? Its just such a fascinating curiosity to me that I've spent tons of time researching how the market works. The market is a living thing! Its the hive mind, except with money.
Also, you mentioned something I found interesting looking at the price over years. I've noticed that its extremely rare for a bull run to run more than 15% in any given burst. If I were a trader, I would take the money and run every single time if I got 10% gains. Thats like christmas and your birthday combined in any forex market, but seems to happen much more often in this volatile bitcoin market. Bull runs tend to go past 15% I think because fear of losing seems to be a stronger emotion than fear of missing out. This makes sense as if you loose out you didn't lose anything you've only gained, but if you lose lose, then you've lost something :-)


Yes it does seem that periods of stability offer time for buildup (news, indicators, psychology), and then as pressure builds you eventually go into full breakout mode, though it can happen both ways. After the btc all time high, there was 1.5 years of a total bear market where the breakouts were constantly negative. 
Now, we can see that bitcoin is thriving in a fundamental sense, and that 3+ years of extremely tough technical work is finally starting to pay off (LN, Rootstock, Tumblebit, funding towards bitcoin blockchain companies, etc).....and I think we entered the bull market when we broke out from mid 200 ranges in oct 2015. Now its more likely that the breakouts will be positive, followed by retractions caused by news events.
In short, I think the random breakouts are more likely to be buys than sells, considering the overall psychology of the market. But always beware powerful contrarians looking to deleverage whimsical bulls.

Bah, everyone is making assumptions here. I never said that they dont need to do it right. Im already quoted literally in this very same thread, read up, where I talk about how they took the time to do it the right way.
Whether it scales to 2500 or 10,000, it will be fine. Whether it scales to 1 billion instantly is ludicrous. That type of scaling does not happen overnight and anyone who insists that "This must be able to scale to 1 billion nodes out of the gate" is a idiot.
Thats not going to happen. Stop dreaming kids and reckon with reality for a minute. We are talking about two entirely different things. One is a short term reality,  and the other is a long term reality.
Why do you think projects have roadmaps? Not everything can be done perfectly from the start, what matters is that it is is good enough, and that there is *plenty* of time for scaling efficiencies. Assuming that this huge complex network is going to be perfect from the starting gates is smoking some goooood shiiiit.
Also, FYI, tcp/ip wasn't good at scaling. Yet here we are with billions of connected devices. Not a excuse to make shitty code, but the point is you can have something that works good out of the box, and that will continue to work good for decades, with plenty of time to scale. It does not, and will not, need to happen overnight. This whole discussion is ridiculous.

Strawman. Of course if better technology comes out there is a increased chance of the less-better technology disappearing.
Just like if a better version of bitcoin comes out it can replace bitcoin.
But the context here is the technology/usefulness of cryptocurrency in a society dominated by inflationary fiat incumbency, aka the ideology that this is *useful*.
What *im* saying is the concept of a deflationary decentralized cryptocurrency is *here to stay* in society because we have a wide enough base that believes there is a benefit to society, or at the very least there is a chance of it becoming commonly used.
Im **not** saying that bitcoin cannot be replaced by the next advantageous cryptocurrency. In fact, I strongly suspect that is inevitable, of course bitcoin wont last forever, of course we will have break throughs in cryptography, computing, trust models, etc, that will be better models than bitcoin.....*eventually*.
The only unknown is *when*, not *if*. Its clear that bitcoin has become big and contentious enough that hardforking is extremely difficult. There will come a time when an improvement is invented that is incompatible with bitcoin and bitcoin cannot reach consensus to upgrade. 
It is within the realm of possibility that btc will fork to this new technology and it will gain incumbency, but its probably more likely the tech will be implemented into a new coin and that will surpass btc.

It is a good analogy if you absorb all of the context. Mail is primarily used to deliver physical goods now and with the Advent of Amazon and other online shopping conglomeration it has only increased the need to deliver physical commodities in the mail.
Where it has changed is that we don't communicate via letter anymore. Which is no big deal because with the rate that we send physical commodities in the mail now it definitely makes up for any lost ground that email has taken away from the postal service.
So the reason anology is good is because it demonstrates that there were always be a dollar and the United States hegemony. Just like there will always be used cases for cryptocurrency. As the technology evolves and as people adapt that use cases will increase.
But the use of the dollar probably won't substantially decrease.

Actually, its still called [Leaky Gut Syndrome](
From someone who is a biohacker, who has friends who are doctors and professional scientists, published researchers, let me just say that what you are saying is outright silly. It sounds like you are trying to say natural medicine is better than science.
Of course the ego gets in the way. There are always going to be doctors who are stuck in old ideology or their particular dogma and refuse to see the other side. This is a issue with the human in question, not within science. Science, in itself, is about utilizing empirical evidence to assess.
This model (the scientific method) is used to justify non-modern/non-western medicine practices *all the time*. You can go on pubmed/hub-sci.cc and lookup any compound thats been used in traditional chinese or ayurvedic medicine and you can see endless publishings on the topic.
Clearly they do look at natural compounds and their effect on humanity, and do it often in a un-biased way. There's a ton of research on turmeric + black pepper (piperine) for example, which has been used for thousands of years to treat inflammation. There was never a denial from science "this does not work!", but more of a cautious assessment of "we need to study this more before forming any conclusions", which is standard practice for scientists. And do not confuse scientists and researchers with doctors. Its like confusing a pharmacist with a pharmacologist or a manufacturer. Completely different purposes on different parts of the ladder.
The point, is to truly understand the underlying mechanisms from both a environmental and genetic view, so that you can apply these methods more efficiently. Something that traditional medicine is incapable of doing.

It does not change consolidated power structures. I agree with everything you've said, and I think it is likely that there will be large mining operations that will continue to consolidate near hydroelectric and other cheap energy sources.
What nearing moore's law will change is competition within the chip market. Which means lower prices. On top of that, more and more embedded crypto mining chips are likely to accelerate that competitive process as more companies like 21 and Brave jump start the micro economy.
The long-vision is that even if there are hub's of mining power, there will be a "death from a thousand cuts" effect where embedded mining devices on the IoT will contribute enormous amounts of micro-mining power.
Its one thing to run 1,000 15TH/s miners, and quite another to have 200,000,000 5gh/s contributing to the network. To be clear, long-vision means 10 + years. I doubt its realistic to see this sort of change occur within 1 decade. 
Of course, this is just a theory and could prove entirely wrong. But if it does, then I would suspect that bitcoin is doomed. Mining must decentralize in some fashion or it cannot continue in a world of quantum AI computer intelligence and dictators. Let is hope that bitcoin remains strong enough to allow for these developments to continue. And to whoever said "graphene", the same philosophy applies. Whether its nano-3d graphene structures inside your fridge mining and auto buying milk or built as a 100k transistor specialized ASIC near a dam in china, the same philosophy applies.
I hope that the dream will fly and not die!

Genesis block dude. 
You are right that Satoshi tried to avoid ideological positions when he wrote on social media but that doesn't mean that he did not hold ideological positions it just meant that he was very careful on how he communicated them.
He was highly critical towards banks in his [p2p foundation post]( and the paper embedded into the Genesis block is quite clearly an ideological statement against banks and inflation.
What's satoshi wasn't by any statement that I've seen was a anarchist. I don't see anywhere where he has advocated about removing government. He clearly just wanted to design a better system for society ran by society that treated citizens around the world more equally. Any extrapolation beyond that is really out of satoshi's written context.
So you are partially right and mostly wrong.

This is good right? If this is true then it would indicate that the theory that tether is not backed by cash assets is false. I suppose it could be a bank using the crypto as collateral to secure a loan to back tether, so we are still in a pretty sketchy situation when we have a prolonged bear market.
As long as the collateral is secured by crypto at a reasonable cheap price than there should be enough wiggle room for the highly volatile Market to swing and still secure the collateral without going bust.

The fed was established 1913. The amount and duration of recessions did not decrease between 1913 and 1930, so I think a more plausible argument is the increase of GDP post WWI allowed better economic activity, which reduced recessions. The data aligns with post WWI increase of GDP and not the creation of the fed.
I wonder what would have happened without the fed in that same scenario?
Best answer so far btw. If we combine this information with [this post]( I think it provides the clearest picture.

I remember listening to this and not thinking anything of the sort. I think all that happened is 3 people made a lot of assumptions about what the other people were saying and communicated poorly. Honestly the interview only made me think more poorly of the BU guys, they came across super douchey and I haven't bothered to listen to them since.
James is not a stupid person. He's far brighter than 99% of the people here. But he's also not a bitcoin developer who spends his life into bitcoin. Its a minor side hobby of his that he's interested in and puts some time into it.
His idea's, while sometimes are very different than what people would propose, are good for the ecosystem because we need to hear contrasting *educated* opinions so that we can discuss them.
With that, I think that he's wrong on the miner centralization issue. I think that with manufacturing nearing moore's law that mining will become much more distributed in the next 10 years, and that the trend of miner centralization we've seen will reverse. I dont think there's a need to change the PoW algo because time will resolve the issue.
But I would definitely not say that he went crazy. Thats a emotional exaggeration.

So, if im reading this and I wanted to summarize this in a compact way, would you say a accurate description would be -
When the block reward gets too low, the economic incentive to attempt a 51% attack (as you call it a reorg) becomes higher, as miners lose less profit with a lower block reward, and it thereby becomes more of a realistic incentive to attempt to recoup large btc transactions through a reorg as opposed to being awarded block subsidy?
My only problem with that logic is that if such a reorg were to occur, the faith in bitcoin as a immutable payment system would be shattered. The price would dive, and any investment into btc would be destroyed.
You would have to assume a large variety of unrealistic conditions in order for this to be possible. First, you would have to assume large scale collusion. Large scale collusion to work on something that would shatter btc would require an assumption that all malicious actors have recuperated 100% of their untold millions of dollars of investments towards mining equipment, and that they would be willing to risk guaranteed future profits as well.
All so that they could do a reorg that would shatter btc's price so quickly that any attempt to obtain profit from those reorg'd transactions would be worth a fraction of what they were prior to the reorg. This doesn't even begin to scratch the surface on the complexities this would add to a exchange trying to honor its customers deposits, orders, etc, which for all we know might halt all operations while the fiasco pans out, which would nullify their attacks. 
Not to mention that the community would likely band together on a HF to the block before the reorg occured, which is pretty likely if it were cut and dry as this. Which would further devalue btc and dive its price into nothingness and create endless complexities. 
Does anyone think those are anywhere near realistic assumptions?

I suppose if the exit node forces the traffic to be non-https, then they would be able to steal credentials. However, doesn't the tor protocol enforce https? Or does that not apply to non-tor networks?
If you had a plugin like https everywhere, and a malicious tor exit node tried to force non https, what would happen? Would the site just complain about the certificate or security?
Just trying to wrap my head around whether LB is giving good, or bad advice. Seems like at a glance their advice is reasonable and encourages people to be safe.

1 sat/byte txs are confirming on the BTC blockchain. Yet here you try to imply that bch is cheap and BTC is not by lying directly to our faces claiming BTC is 40 sat/byte **when all data suggests otherwise**.
The beyond stupid reality is that by over paying in fees you are skewing the fee algorithms and making your enormous stupidity self prophetic. If you actually followed the tech and batched with segwit it wouldn't cost anymore to use BTC than bch, but your company spent all it's money on marketing and very little on real development.

In researching why the Federal Reserve Act was enacted, the thought process was if we back these banks with a central bank, then it would reduce bank runs because the central banks will issue credit and take debt from the non-central banks, preventing these banks from collapsing and thereby ensuring a more fluid credit system.
Reducing bank runs would reduce recessions, because recessions happen when there is reduced economic activity for various reasons, but one primary reason in this context is the inability for banks to lend (due to bank runs), which then throws sand in the economy due to reduced ability to lubricate the commerce economy through said lending.
Looking at the history of recessions, you can see that the frequency and length of recessions have drastically reduced since the establishment of the Federal Reserve.
What I would like to discuss is the cost. What are the costs to society that we have caused through the enactment of the Federal Reserve Banking system, and what are the benefits?
Im no economics major, so forgive my basic premise. But I see one of the major costs to be inflation. Since the enactment of the FED, 103 years ago, we've seen a 2,332 % inflation rate, according to this calculator -
Im unsure how accurate that is, though I've read before that 1 dollar in 1913 is worth 4 cents today, which does not align with that calculator. 
So the devaluation of our money is a personal cost to society, though one that is arguably able to be mitigated through standard basic financial care, such as diversifying your portfolio.
The benefit, in this case, is a vastly increased GDP due to the economy being in less recessions over time. As the article indicates, here are the time tables and % of recession time through various years....






Could others please elaborate on the costs and benefits  of the federal reserve? Im not interested in tin hat theories, but real economic data of cause and effect. The way this effects my perspective on bitcoin is to understand the role that central authorities play in macro fiscal policy, and how they can evolve to influence the economy. Is it better or worse to give a man a lever? We could of course argue both perspectives, so by all means go crazy!
But most importantly, please be data specific. Leave the ego's and opinions at the door unless they are backed by empirical data.

You are engaging in a false dichotomy and presenting the scenario in different shades than it really was.
UASF did not directly activate SW. It was a grass roots movement that lead to the creation of the NYA to "compromise" between bitcoin core proponents and non-bitcoin core (big blocker, BU, Bitcoin ABC) proponents.
The NYA wouldn't have existed if not for the UASF movement. There would have been no reason for a compromise if there were not two sides fighting each other.
You trying to portray the technical facts completely misses the social ones. I've tried to explain to you 3 times now you cannot debate social movements. There are no "facts" to be right or wrong on.
The NYA had the heaviest "weight" when it came to getting SW activated, because this is a multi-dimensional issue with many factors to consider. It allowed for the big blockers to get their way, so they agreed to activate segwit.
Except single organizations do not get to decide the fate of bitcoin. Only the entire ecosystem coming to consensus on what software to run can determine the fate of bitcoin.
And that fate, as we ultimately saw determined, was against bigger blocks and pro SW.
**Otherwise we would not be sitting on an activated segwit today without larger blocks beyond SW's 4mb max weight**.
Your opinions are irrelevant. What matters is **what actually happened**, and what actually happened was the NYA convinced enough mining cartels to signal for SW (not the only reason, but probably the biggest one) to get it activated.
Then these same miners went and launched their own altcoin called bitcoin cash to get their big blocks **since the ecosystem wholely rejected doing a hard fork for larger blocksize increase**. Don't you remember bitmain's blogpost about an "emergency miner activated soft fork" if they did not get their blocksize increase? Then imagine that, when they didn't get their way suddenly this mysterious bitcoin ABC project came out of no where and totally had *nothing* to do with bitmain! /s
The NYA would not have existed if not for the UASF movement. I don't claim UASF activated segwit, I claim that the movement forced the hand of others to make moves they didn't want to as a "compromise", when there could never be a compromise, thereby activating SW. The problem is you are trying to pretend UASF had no impact on the activation of SW. This is as wrong as claiming UASF activated SW. You are just as wrong as the people you are arguing with. The truth is *both* things activated segwit because one could not have existed without the other.
If you were part of the NYA movement, you got bamboozled. Along with all the participants. Rightly deserved too, after trying to bamboozle everyone else forcing a hardfork on the network with lies of "full consensus from the ecosystem" blah blah lie lie.
This was nothing but shitty businesses who want to subsidize the costs of operating their business onto consumers.  It was anti-science and anti-intellectualism.
When you ignore the **vast majority** of experts in the ecosystem on the right way to push forward you will ultimately end up on the wrong side of history. NYA and the people it convinced to signal for SW that previously were not signaling are all on the wrong side of history. They are on the bitcoin cash side, while bitcoiners who fought to activate SW (and therefore LN) were on the right side of history.

According to [bitnodes.io]( there is currently 5246 nodes operating on the bitcoin network.
Isn't it kind of untruthful for you to say 2500 nodes is "nearly nothing" when it literally represents half of the entire current bitcoin network?
My first impression was "Wow, thats a shitload of nodes for testing!" ....silly that you have the exact opposite view.

While that was not my comment and I do not believe every computer has a infection, there is a significant infection rate. 32% according to Panda Security, which is a leading AV suite.
So literally 1 out of 3 people you see walking around is infected. And thats just the infections that we know about, obviously the actual infection rate is much higher when you take into account all of the 0day exploits and unknown persistent vulnerabilities. If you are going to follow up this message with another stupid reply saying something like "Oh yea, well where's your source", its called do your own research, but to give you a idea you can start with googling "shadow broker" to see just a tiny fraction of the exploits/toolkits that nation states have that are utilized undetected. You can google stuxnet or watch the documentary to see for yourself exactly how many computers ended up being infected all over the world without anyone knowing.
When you account for the unaccountable, then the rate is obviously significantly higher than the detectable infections.
And please do not troll our sub. Your whiny immature replies are not wanted here and if you want to know something then take the initiative and do your own research. All answers are available if you choose to seek them out with 5 seconds of your time.

So basically, the Monero flexcap scheme is incompatible with bitcoin.
In Mark Friedenbach's proposal where the the oversized block reward deferment is given to a later miner who mines a smaller block, what would happen if the blocksize steadily increased and no one ever had a economic reason to make that smaller block? Or, is "smaller block" just 1 byte smaller than whatever the last block was? I thought that the deferment would be based on the blocksize of the block that was penalized. So if that were the case today, and someone did a block 1 byte larger than 1MB, then its plausible that the transactional fee's contained in each block going forward would be worth more than whatever the overblock size reward deferment was worth, making a deferment that could be potentially lost forever?
Or am I just rambling and thats not realistic?
And is the deferment elastic based on the size of expansion/reduction? If someone did 1.1mb and got a 10% reduction in a block reward, would someone who did 1.05mb 2 blocks later get the full 10% or only 5%? Would the deferment award simply carry on until the full value was realized and taken?

Either you don't know what inflation is or you don't know how Bitcoin works.
Bitcoin has built-in inflation that is reduced with every halving event. How is it that you propose that will be changed? BCH exists because we couldn't agree to change a metric that required a hard fork and you think we could come to consensus on changing one of the most fundamental aspects of Bitcoin?
Maybe you should shitpost less and read more about Bitcoin. Your ignorance is showing. There are definitely delusional people in every industry or market, but at least the people here understand how Bitcoin works.

This is where everyone is delusionally fanatical about bitcoin and scorn anything that takes market share.
I think ETH, despite all of its troubles is going to be a major success. Even with the hard fork. Infact that will only bring institutional investors closer to the ETH pipe dream because they dont like immutability. Now that they see that they can influence the network they will be more likely to play. Im not arguing in their favor, or in the favor of ETH doing the HF, just pointing out that non-technical/financial people really dont understand this and the importance behind immutability. 
Long-long term though? Unknown. But in the next 10 years I think ETH will be huge just like bitcoin.

Excellent reply. 


I do not know why the chart decided on that date, but it seems obvious they just wanted to use easy starting-finishing dates. I dont know why they would use a different range honestly. If you are going to look at data from a non-biased perspective then you shouldn't cherry pick starting or finishing dates to skew the data.


Yes, I've noted that in other posts.


I agree, the actual severity of the recessions should be a data point in the graph. they should have used color from bright green to dark red to gauge severity.


Yes and no. We have a government that has told us our "Great Recession" ended officially end of 2009. But a lot of economists question whether the government is cherry picking data to sustain that notion to change the psychology and encourage market activity.
So you would think we only have up to go from our down, yet here we are still mired in the mud, 8 years after the recession started. Of course, its a complicated picture with new tools being applied and different conditions, so its greatly different then from now. Just food for thought.




After all the discussion, im inclined to believe this. It does indeed seem that geopolitical and macro socioeconomical factors is what led to the stability of our economy and not central banking. 
It would be really fun to have modern economists from various schools of thought debate the theoretical what-if of what our modern society would look like under the same conditions, but minus the federal reserve.

While any and all work done in the realm of privacy and fungibility is important, I would like to point out that any mixing technology that relies upon p2p is less efficient than a trustless hub and spoke model.

He's confused, but I understand why. It is complicated because there are examples of what he's talking about, but he's applied this general philosophy on the entirety of the medical community and that's absurd.
There's a reason why there are publishers and central authorities in medicine and science. Its to make sure that the quality of research being published is not biased.
A good example is how the publishing houses are basically a racket.  Scientists get funded through public subsidy, then publish the research through these prestigious journals, and then these journals sell licenses and publishings for outrageous amounts back to the public.
Its a good example of a central authority corruption issue within the system. Yet, science still gets published, progress still goes forward at fast paces. Could it be better? Sure, but it does not take away the legitimacy of the publishings, only reinforces it because there is a economic incentive to ensure the publishers doing the peer review are accredited. Without the accreditation, they would loose favor and people would stop publishing it through them.
But none of this means that traditional medicine "is better" than modern medicine, just that people are corruptible, and individual ego's will always get in the way or progress.
Another good example is that modern medicine has refuted lyme disease for quite some time. And there are even *doctors* today that deny the existence of chronic lyme disease. It wasn't until we had hard proof in the form of measuring a spiral shaped bacterium known as a spirochete as correlative with lyme disease, that the pendulum started to sway.
But his argument goes like this - 
Traditional medicine knew there was a problem before modern medicine *accepted* it.
But who cares? If traditional medicine cannot treat lyme disease, what does it even matter whether its recognized or not?  Wheres the traditional medicinal cures for Fibromyalgia, Parkinsons, Alzheimers, chronic fatigue (thats just a stupid generalization) etc? And how do you differentiate psychological based issues in traditional medicine?
You cant!
Modern science is about measuring empirical evidence before making claims. This is essential, because without it we would not have valuable forms of *proof*.
Its like saying "Get rid of the blockchain, we dont need all that fancy crypto hashing, I've got 100 trusted friends who say that my transaction was successfully completed!"
Empirical evidence in the scientific/medicinal modern community is  asynchronous to proof of work. Without it, *we cannot be sure* something existed. With it *we can* ...and its as simple as that.

While this may be true, I think the abolishment on cash will restrict liberties in a way that will have a net negative benefit to society.
It will not eliminate terrorism, drugs, cartels, etc, as these things occur as-is through the existing banking system. So restricting cash is just politicians pandering as per usual without any realistic cause and effect on the things they claim to be fighting. 
So while it may be beneficial to the long term growth of bitcoins value, it will not help society to do this. Should we see the abolishment of cash, we will of course see a much more heavily regulated bitcoin industry as this is a way to side step state controlled fiscal policy.
I dont see that as a good thing.
In the end, I see it as a lose-lose. We lose cash, which means losing freedom, but we will also see a knee jerk reaction to what is inevitable, bitcoin being used to side step the system, which causes a harsh legislative reaction to curtail usage, which then prevents people from using bitcoin as cash.

I do see the information and noticed it before, but I've not been able to formulate a reason as to the why. There are obviously technologies and changes to the system that would have had a impact on price discovery, like swaps and futures. Though that was 1981 so would not have had a effect.
The most rocky times were from the great depression until about the 1960's stock market wise, yet we had the least amount of recessions.
Generally speaking, I do not see the price discovery and excessive volatility as having a great negative impact on the well being of society, because as you can see the volatility of the market did not send the economy into recession.

Do some reading on the lightning Network. No, it's not a cop out, It's impossible for a Bitcoin like cryptocurrency to scale to the billions without distributing it's resource load efficiently to a cash like layer that does not permanently store transactional information.
Essentially coins can be traded back and forth tens, hundreds, thousands of times on LN without ever being recorded in the blockchain. It's only recorded when it goes in and when it goes out of the system.

The more economic activity that goes through a non mining node the more important that node is. Bitcoin is a market-based economy just like everything else and he who has the most money usually tends to win the arguments in Bitcoin land.
Nodes ran by wallet providers or Fiat bridges, for example, have powerful voices even if they don't contribute hash power to the network.
This is why it's important to be your own node and to spend from it. It's important to be decentralized and to not consolidate too much power into others hands especially on a peer-to-peer Network where that's not necessary. 
Running a full node that doesn't have any economic activity still helps for the robustness of the network but it won't prevent a split from happening. It will just ensure that there is a higher node count for the portion of the split economy that it sits on.
The more nodes you have the harder it is to DDOS the network.

Bitcoin is something that even technophiles have a difficult time wrapping their head around. People who have not invested *years* into the industry have no place dictating what the timelines are for highly complex projects.
Your "disqualifier" was falsely represented. There is real data on the subject had anyone bothered to look it up. So its *not* "anyones best guess". When you want the answer, to straight to the horses mouth. Dont guess.


You are showing your ignorance. This is what I meant about the new account comment.  The moment LN goes live it will offer orders of magnitude pressure relief to the network. The only theoretical question that can only be answered by deployment is how quickly can we get hubs from spoke and hub models to start opening payment channels to encourage users to use them. Users will have a economic incentive to use the channels so the adoption will come, the unknown is only how quickly. Remember that we only need enough relief to take pressure off full blocks. Thats only a fraction of the networks traffic. So if LN takes only a small fraction of the networks traffic, and we can get 950kb blocks, then fee pressure will drop for on chain payments, confirmation times will go back to "normal".
Remember that it is money that makes the wheel go around. When you understand the underlying incentives *and* the technology behind it, then you can speak to the issue.

Which hypothesis?

Unless you are to suggest that we've seen all of the capital flight ever into bitcoin? That would be a bad bet :)
A short term analysis of one single correction adds literally zero weight to the discussion. I'll take a listen about correlation being part of overall evidence when you have 5+ years of market data showing me consistent results.
Keep in mind that this data must include major recessions, events that would normally dictate capital flight out of the market and into gold like assets. If the data does not include several of these events into consideration then its cherry picked data that I'll wipe my butt with.
Otherwise its just pulling guesses out of the air. Anyone can do that :)

....I have no idea what im talking about, yet you have to go back to "ancient times", where there is little documentation and no way to prove anything to make your point? Hardly convincing.
Sorry but for someone who is so vast in knowledge you seem to have a knack for ignoring the obvious. There is no free market. If you must quote "In ancient times" to make your point, then you've already defeated your own argument.


Oh even better! We are going to use fairy tales now to support our theory. 


Ah, there we go. Now you've just admitted you either did not understand my statement, or you are ignorant of your own argument? Anarcho-capitalism is compatible with a free market. Perhaps you don't know the definition? Let me help you -


NOW, lets go back to my original comment -


If Anarcho-Capitalism is about the elimination of the state, then it would setup a environment for a free market. Did I say "Anarcho-Capitalism is not compatible with free market" ? No, I said *government*, which means "state". Are you learning now?
For someone who doesn't know what he's talking about, I seem to be factually correct, and for someone who seeks to "teach" others, you seem to have a really inefficient way about communicating your "facts". Next time you want to pick a fight on the internet with someone, dont do it with me. Im not interested in childish insults as the opening statement.
As a final "hey you're not so smart as you think you are", maybe you should lookup the definition of free-market?


All I said is that government and free markets are not compatible. You should understand the definition of free-market before launching a tirade of accusations of ignorance. The definition literally states that a free market must be free of intervention from government.
I challenged you to show me a market that existed with both government and no regulation, and you've yet to provide any evidence. If you are going to say ridiculous things like "In ancient times"....im going to call them ridiculous. The burden of proof is upon you to provide evidence to the contrary of common sense, and in this case, contrary to the *definition of the word*. As you grow older and wiser, you'll learn that humans are infallible, and any government that exists that is controlled by humans will assert some sort of control over the market. This is impossible to avoid, because the problem lies within the imperfection of humanity. Show me a perfect human and I will tell you that *he* is capable of running a government compatible with a free market. Short of a perfect human which does not exist, such a market cannot exist.
Again, government and free market is incompatible, *by definition*.....learn to read before you pick on others.

While this kind of tech is absolutely a step in the right direction, and I have no negative criticism for the technique, it should definitely still be explained that malware will still effectively exploit in-browser javascript techniques.
Just because your browser is using crypto-magic does not mean that there is not a spy hiding in the browser looking at your keys while they are being used, storing them, and then uploading them to their remote server once you have a internet connection.
I think the *ultimate* solution would be to have a hardware keysigning device that works in conjunction *with* the client side in-browser javascript to do the signing, that way there is no possibility of malware hijacking your keys.
If no hardware solution is available to you, then I would recommend a live OS which has a fresh installation of a open source browser so that you can be sure there is no malware present!
So I say to BTCPAY, please add support to trezor, ledger and any open source hardware devices! That would be the best ever.

But then wouldn't the attacker have to know where you are going?

That would have to be a very, very specifically crafted attack for a select group of people.
I have seen CA's issued that ended up being malicious, so that part is not outside the realm of possibilities. And if this were a nation state attacking, of course thats possible.

Yet, in the way I used it the usage was correct. You can absolutely be *both* pre-existing *and* legacy. In fact, if you stop and think about it for more than 5 seconds before writing responses, you will realize that something *must* be preexisting in order for it to be a legacy system. For a legacy system is a system of the past, so it *must* be pre-existent since it already exists.


My point wasn't that it has, but that digital payment systems will replace our current mode of exchange. But specifically legacy digital payment systems (current banking computer ledgers), will be replaced by ["DGL"'s and "CBDC"s]( When it comes to bitcoin, bitcoin clearly has the technological advantage both in code, security and infrastructure. It will likely reign for years to come, especially in niche markets. Commercial applications TBS.


You have it backwards. The monowheel is the legacy technology, and the automobile is the one that superseded it.

@_date: 2019-01-12 18:12:47
Cool. Good discussion man, have an upvote. Even though this is a technology-based community I am continually surprised at the lack of thought/depth into these topics. I think most of the time its because the participants are interested in technology as a past-time or a hobby and they don't have real-world experience to grant them the capability to see the bigger picture here. I do have quite a bit of experience in dealing with large networks so I can visualize downstream-effects from a top down perspective.


I guess what I was doing more specifically is detailing how the various types of scaling effects different systems, e.g. decentralized vs centralized. So more specifically I was comparing networks and how scaling affects them.


This is not a false statement but it was not my point. My point was that the type of scaling has different effects in different network environments. I will try to be more specific -
Horizontal scaling in a datacenter has an immediate and instant real-world effect. Lets take scaling horizontally via round robin. Lets presume that your upstream bandwidth at your colo is not your bottleneck (it usually isn't with terabit fiber existant today), but specifically cpu/hdd threading + memory (which usually is the bottleneck).
By horizontally scaling within your datacenter you are splitting the loads between a single server vs multi-sever (which can be horizontally scaled to "infinity" servers, or whatever the physical real world limitation may be....google is said to have 1m+ servers for google.com)
By distributing the load via horizontal expansion you are able to immediately expand the thoroughput of your web-server(s). This has an immediate real-world effect.
But you cannot do this in decentralized networks. In a decentralized network with an individual node deciding to double his HD space or RAM or increase CPU power has no effect upon the greater network unless other participants in the network also simutaneously upgrade.
This is why the meme exists. Because if you want to increase network thoroughput in a decentralized network you have to *optimize* the protocol. 
The network-effects of equipment upgrades in a decentralized network will *always* be extremely lagged. It takes *years* for equipment upgrades to have a macro-effect upon bandwidth/propagation.
So the greater point here is that horizontal scaling in a decentralized network is a complete waste of resources. It serves no purpose. By making protocol decisions that increase bandwidth you are merely forcing node operators to subsidize the bitcoin network. This will lead to less and less node operators until the entire system is centralized.
If you view this like the VISA network, that would basically be like each individual store having to pay the visa network card fee, as they are the 'node' in the network. Lets pretend instead of visa increasing security and optimizing the protocol they just force shop-owners to have 2-3 visa terminals, requiring them to pay 2-3x-10x more as the network grows.
Thats a unsustainable business model. You don't force the participants in the network to subsidize your business model. At least not if you want your business model to last. There has to be trade-off's here that benefit the node operators. The VISA example is poor because there's not really a good comparison here.
bitcoin node operators don't have a massive financial incentive to support the network due to tragedy of the commons. Basically, if you operate a business and you are taking a lot of payments in bitcoin then you have a financial incentive to run a node (e.g. prevent double spends) vs trusting a 3rd party node.
But to the average person? They don't have that incentive. They can easily rationalize "Well if I stop running mine today there are thousands of others that are still running and will still run" e.g. tragedy of the commons. I used to run nodes and it got to be kinda a pain so I stopped. Why? Because I have no incentive to run one. I was doing it altrustically.
So this means that we must balance the incentive structure vs the cost structure. Unfortunately that is broken in bitcoin. There is no financial incentive to non-business owners to operate a node. Fortunately LN fixes this missing incentive structure. But the base blockchain layer is still broken in this regard which is why optimizing the protocol vs horizontal expansion is the obvious solution( Edit - + 2nd layer networks).


This is correct but its only one small consensus-based aspect of the protocol design. It doesn't get into the deeper cause-and-effect of changes to the system/protocols. Changing the blocksize is a protocol decision that has far-reaching consequences. You only do it if you have trade-off's that have positive benefits that outweigh the negative ones.
So the next line of questioning would be - What tradeoff's do we get for horizontally scaling vs protocol optimization? Well, we immediately subsidize transactional costs by making it cheaper. This is however both a short term and a artificial solution. It cannot be sustained long term and only creates a short-term incentive for end users, by punishing node operators forcing them to subsidize the transactional costs. This *might* be an effective solution in certian cases, e.g. bootstrapping a network with a long-term plan to change this consequence. But for a network that had already existed for 8 years and was looking a linear growth resource usage cost? That doesn't make very much sense and would ultimately destroy the security model.
No security, no censorship resistence. No censorship resistance, why even bother?
Hindsight is 20/20. We look at bitcoin today with just *basic* optimizations (segwit + increased transaction batching) we've seen stablization in transaction prices to all time lows. It was the right decision. Sure, we can have network attacks startup again (im lookin at you jihan and roger) from competitors attempting to sabatoge the network to force market share reallocation (the same way that sites get ddos'd by competitors forcing users to flock to alternatives), but looking at the facts as they lie today clearly bitcoin core developers made the correct choice to optimize vs horizontal scale.
Looking forward at schnorr + MAST? Thats when some serious optimizations occur.
The future is bright. Ignore the price and keep hustlin.

Valid point, which is why I agree with your KYC statement. These systems will be gamed for selfish reasons, and then the system will evolve to account for these incidents.
Also, I think it is unrealistic to assume that those who are participating in this autonomous ride share economy are not identified by a central authority, i.e. Tesla.
There is a basic assumption that if you are not present in your car, that anyone can vandalize your car and get away with it. I dont think a program like this would work without initially getting over this obstacle. You cannot convince people to lend out their car if their cars are going to be at risk from passengers, therefore there would *have to be KYC* from the get go.
Unfortunately that means no anonymous rides, which sucks, but hey you cant win them all. 
As to the OP, yes, we can take legacy technology and create bridges and throw lots of complexity on top of it to make it work, *or* we can use a currency that just natively works.
I think that each customer should have a credit check and credit card on file, so that if damages are sought that they can be charged if needed, but its *easier* for a computer system to check a bitcoin payment than it is for it to check a credit card payment. The bitcoin payment does not need a central authority to verify its validity, but the credit card payment needs gateways and authorities to approve. 
Im going to vote for the decentralized and simpler option every time.

This is not a good response because it does not explain the drop in recession during the 1900-1950 period. It does rationalize other things, but does not explain the original premise, that we've seen a reduction in recessions since the enactment of the fed. It tells part of the picture, but not the whole, and does not apply both ways so cannot be considered a full answer or a explanation.

And how aware of CB's policies regarding mixing are you to support that statement?
Im pretty sure that CB's risk assessment team will flag heavily coinjoin transactions for review. Since coinjoin isn't a 100% established way to "untaint", manual review would end up resulting in actually the thing you are trying to avoid with CJ as a "solution".
Note - i think privacy tech is awesome and want it to be the default mode of transaction. But right now it sticks out like a sore thumb and regulatory pressure will just see these transactions immediately flagged or blacklisted.
Once we have Schnoor/MAST and can natively batch/CJ all transactions without it appearing to be a CJ (e.g. looking like any other multi-sig tx) then CJ will proably be "safe" as a means to un-taint unwanted associations from donations.

Yet, we must learn how to walk before we run. So it makes sense to get the routing efficiency better first, before attempting to scale further. 
You dont workout for the first time before a weightlifting competition. You have to spend years forming your muscles to the task, just like developers need to hack away at code to improve efficiency, before they can tackle the big tasks.
Considering that, I think we have plenty of years to work out scale at the billions. That type of activity does not happen over night, or even over year, for that matter. 
Besides, Rusty is involved in this. With people like Bram Cohen and Rusty involved, I would expect those in the know to have faith. I think those in the know *do* have faith, and its just those who are not aware of the intellectual caliber and experience that is on this task, that end up lacking faith and spread pessimism.

I personally feel it is this point that most severely impacts business models accepting bitcoin. Its way too clunky right now and even with [POS integration](  the amount of training and learning curve it takes for the fraction of a fraction of a customer base that wants to use it is a clear negative cost to any business. It takes money to train, and then it takes resources to audit/re-train, and then when a customer actually *does* want to use bitcoin my bet is on that the manager will be called, the manager probably wont even know how to do it since their training was minimal and X months ago, that the customer gives up trying.
Add on top of that the fraud risk for cashiers incorrectly accepting payment and its a lose-lose.

Bankchains suffer from the traditional security vulnerabilities of hacking, which is why they are unlikely to succeed. However, with a federated or oracle model, if they erect enough barriers then it becomes unfeasible for a hacker to infiltrate so many super-nodes. If they use, say, a 14 of 15 multisig required model for any transaction over X amount, then they eliminate any possibility of traditional hacking overcoming their system. of course, they then create just another turnkey system where it takes a large amount of human approval, which is the opposite direction of where we need to go for near-instant automated and secure.
If they dont do PoW then they need to decide where they want to make their tradeoff, in security, or in speed.
Also, I think you read too deeply into my message. I never came close to conveying that PoW was a bad idea, only that OP was incorrect.

Depends on your definition of consensus. The consensus mechanism *is not* social consensus.
If you are confusing social consensus to be the consensus mechanism that governs bitcoin, then you are incorrectly applying the wrong term.
Developers are not supposed to be cabals of priests that tell the masses how to behave. Its the exact opposite. It is the masses, through utilization of features, who decide whether or not to run a particular piece of software.
There was no feature introduced here. There was no upgrade. This was purely social-psychological influence. That is a direct threat to the decentralization model of cryptocurrencies. 
I understand how humans work, im not ignoring reality. But I am trying to take a particularly technical stand on the principals of these systems we are all a part of.

I think thats intellectually dishonest. ETH is going through growing pains just like bitcoin, but they have clearly created a technology that is different than bitcoin, that enables all sorts of features that bitcoin (currently) does not have, and that its disingenuous to state otherwise.
Less rabid attacking, more understanding please. 
@_date: 2016-09-26 18:32:09
If a attack must use social events for timing, and each attack becomes less effective as developers patch the system, then I think its safe to say that this is a example of hardening in real time and is not a real threat.
Whatever attacks occur will simply create a more anti-fragile Ethereum, similar to how BTC suffered the same attacks. It was all resolved rather quickly, and thats impressive considering that it was service providers themselves who needed to upgrade their code to distinguish between the good vs the malformed (malleability bug) transactions that were being broadcasted.
I personally think that these actions are normal, the same way that it is normal for us humans to get sick and develop antibodies. We will become stronger in the process.
Its when you try to approach the situation with safe zones, safety nets and other fragility approaches that it harms the system. You must become anti-fragile, and this only occurs through evolution based on threats.
This is actually very good for the long term viability of ETH. I think attacks will continue to happen, and they will continue to patch them. Not a big deal, business as usual, and healthy.
As for the "threat of centralization" ....is that a joke? We've watched ETH use social consensus to hardfork. The developers became priests in a cabal of control at that point, and it clearly demonstrated that ETH is in no way shape or form decentralized. Anyone who thinks ETH needs to be decentralized to exist is not recognizing these facts, and that the centralization has long already occurred. 
I think ETH will go on to be the "legal zone" competitor to bitcoin, where it will comply with regulations. It will be a cluster fuck, but I think thats the route they will go. Whether thats a long term viable solution is of course open to debate.

Of course it had an influence just like uasf was the reason that the Nya was made.
All of these events are connected but you can't have one without the other. The Nya was a compromise between uasf and Big Blocks.
Except the uasf movement was a no compromise movement. Which is why a lot of the Bitcoin core developers were actually against it in the beginning because they didn't want to see anyone forced by anything. When it came apparent that there was collusion happening at a corporate level appearing to influence the network then some of the developers changed their mind and said that after weighing the facts that UASF was the best way to go. A kind of better of two evils scenario.
I actually changed my mind several times on uasf so I don't feel particularly attached or bonded to the movement but when I look at a Grassroots movement driven by consumers versus a big business propaganda campaign I'm going to choose the side of the Grassroots movement any day.
Uasf was the Grassroots movement and Nya was the pro-business cabal. We definitely do not want cabals of business making decisions for Bitcoin. As we saw with Asic boost there became an economic incentive misaligned between large entities and what's best for the network. I don't trust these businesses anymore to make the right decisions for the end users.

Does the government own the radio frequencies mesh networks operate on?
The answer is yes, so the 2nd answer is also yes. 
Uhm, wut? Exactly how does that make your point? The internet is not a market, but there are markets created by the internet. similarly, there is a "internet" market, but that is just one service offered by the property owners of the various networks. To try to encompass the entire structure under one umbrella as a market is not supported by any data or theories that I've seen. Im of course welcome to look at the data if someone wants to spend the time....
Also the internet is a global entity, so if you are going to lay some "market" claim, then you would have to seperate it into regions, which would then be *intranets*, not "the internet", which would ultimately be under state authorities that regulate those markets, hence no free market.

@_date: 2016-09-27 16:36:19


Correct, at least in accordance to bitcoin's consensus mechanism. Thats why I originally stated that it depends on what definition you are using. Social consensus *does* absolutely have to do with influence. See [here]( -






Incorrect. Consensus is a post-reality, not a pre-context. Consensus is *achieved* (as in a current tense when it happens, or a future tense once its achieved), not a "mechanism for *making* a decision" (notice how you used it in future-tense)......Dont believe me? Why not read the [definition]( -


Consensus is achieved once nodes agree on validating a block. Its not a pre-emptive context that allows for change. Its a post-event fact made apparent.
Now this is where we get murky. Yes, I agree with your original statement that consensus is obviously working because the majority of the network agreed to go forward on a specific path. By definition, consensus was achieved.
But, you neglected to account for my last statement, and its especially annoying when people cherry pick your post, ignore your other context, and make generalized statements without taking in the bigger picture. Here's what I said -


The point was that if you use *social consensus* to achieve consensus (bitcoin algo), then you are poisoning the well. You are choosing to use psychological influence from a central authority, instead of allowing the softwares features to determine the outcome.
This is a complex topic, so I understand why there's confusion here, and why people were downvoting me. They are not inside my head, and they dont see the complexities involved with the mechanisms here.
If we create a system that relies upon dictators to dictate action, then can you call it decentralized? Yes, I understand that by definition that consensus was achieved, but I see the achievement of that particular consensus as being achieved through anti-bitcoin principals. 
If you must use *Social Consensus* to force the issue, then you are not decentralized. If you are not decentralized, then you are not resilient to attack. If you are not resilient to attack, then your network will likely fail, or at best be co-opted by malicious or selfish actors.
So as you can see, this is a discussion of principles and ethos. Im sure that a lot of developers would agree with the examples I've provided, because they themselves are the source of much of that content. It is only because I've listened to developers from bitcoin talk about decentralization that I understand this issue.
That is why people like Gregory Maxwell has been so persistent in maintaining decentralization and working on fungibility. He understands the core principals of decentralization and how they effect the long term health of the network.
Hopefully this post will help you see we have common ground.

That's a good response and I appreciate you taking the time to write it, however you just confirmed exactly what I originally said which was that none of these systems can secure their chain without proof of work.
You also confirmed that all of these systems rely upon a central coordinator and that no one has found a good way to replace that process yet.
All of these systems rely on Federated/centralized models in order to resolve transaction discrepancies.That makes every single one of these systems inferior to real decentralized proof of work systems that actually protect value.
If the trade-off for having a less resource intensive system to resolve transaction discrepancies is less security, then I'm sorry but I'm not interested in that.
Never trade your Liberty for a false sense of security. That's exactly what these systems are doing they taking away individual sovereignty and allowing centralized authoritarians to dictate how the cards will fall.
How is that any different from any other centralized monetary system that exist today? What positives do these centralized systems provide that we do not already have with dwolla PayPal authorize.net and all of these other Payment Systems which use centralized models to resolve transaction discrepancies?

Assumptions make a ass out of everyone. Better to be specific with your criticisms. 
I think there is some minor validity to your comment, though it is mostly bikeshedding considering the content. The user in question, if he really used a 11c CAD fee and only had 1 input/output, should have had his tx picked up by the network no problem.
Likely the issue is related to multiple inputs/outputs, which requires higher fee's. 


The problem here, is that the user clearly used a manual process to send the transaction instead of relying on existing infrastructure to determine the fee for him. Had he used *the really easy to use dynamic fee calculation features that developers have created* , then maybe his transaction wouldn't have gotten stuck.
This is like someone who decides to drive his car to work with the full knowledge that there will be traffic the entire way, then when he gets late to work complaining about it, all while knowing that there was a subway station that would have taken him 1/3rd of the time had he used it.

Not when you account for the exponential growth of new investors with each wave, plus the dynamics of market price has way more to do with restricted Supply than anything else. I stand by my statement.
Just because Bitcoin is worth 150 billion or 200 billion whatever it is on that day doesn't mean that there was that much money spent to get it to that point. It just means that there were a lot more buyers than sellers. That equilibrium will continue to be distributed disproportionately and the disproportion will be accelerated on the buyer side and deaccelerated on the seller side during the next Bull Run which will allow a small amount of money to move the market cap in the billions.
In order for your scenario to be true that would mean that every single Bitcoin would need to be both available to sell and liquidity present to buy. I think. In fact I'm not even sure if that scenario would end up resulting in your description.
To provide an example of how you're incorrect imagine that there is only one seller on bitfinex and the current market price is 10,000 but he has one coin up for 11,000. It would only take one single person spending 11,000 in order to move the price a $1,000. This is exactly what happens during bull runs the supply-side gets restricted and the demand side outpaces leading to jumps and prices in very high ratios.
To better explain why this happens let me give you a real world scenario. Let's say you're an apple seller Merchant in a Marketplace and you harvest 50 apples a day. Your first day on the market you go to the market and your price your apples at $0.10 each and you sell out in the first 30 minutes. Well since you have a finite amount of apples that you can Harvest per day then it makes much more sense to adjust your pricing so that you sell out slower and make more money.
People selling Bitcoin are influenced by the same exact psychology when the price starts rising and sellers start pulling their sell orders knowing that they can sell their Bitcoin for more if they just raise the price. This has a circular looping effects creating an environment where less and less people are willing to sell because greed is what runs markets.
Edit - I see others have explain the market dynamics quite accurately to you.  I hope this was a learning experience for everyone :)

The old always die not embracing the newest generations technology. 
We are not here to pander to dinosaurs.  They can learn how to use new technology or they can stay in the dark. Bitcoin evangelism is annoying as hell so let's stop pretending it's a religion. It's opt-in financial sovereignty, not forced debt.
I don't care about random dudes podcasts or their userbases. They will either find the motivation or they won't. Either way I don't see it as adoption, these are non consequential use cases. Anyone already can at anytime already send these guys Bitcoin.

I just wanted to say that I think the community should support member's constrasting viewpoints. I think that this response, while it might be perceived as negative to a lot of bitcoiners, is actually a very rational response.
I also agree with it. Bitcoin is *not* mainstream, and I think we must accept that fact. I think *are on the path to* being mainstream, but we are not there yet.
Most importantly, I've added emphasis [bold] to the important part. *That* is the golden goose that we are looking for. Using bitcoin as a rail for interglobal payments, without people even realizing they are using bitcoin.
The real question is, will bitcoin be used for that? Or will the banking establishment just make their own systems? You would have to be living underneath a rock to not see that the banking establishment [is doing exactly that](
So the question is really, *how* will bitcoin fit into this evolving industry?
It will almost certainly fill a niche category. Bitcoin is permissionless, and needs no authority for its use, so there are endless use cases where bitcoin will be the rails infrastructure that regulated entities cannot use because of cross border legalities. 
The real question is whether bitcoin will remain resilient to the attacks of nation states and economic realities. Will it remain "decentralized-enough" ? Will its incentive system continue to function in 2024 after the btc reward drops to 3.125? Will btc's pricepoint offer enough economic incentive during these halvings that it will continue to be a economic viable solution to game theory?
Will the technological advancement of alternative-to-silicone transistor tech keep advancing? Or will we stagnate? Will graphene live up to its hype? Will 3D nano stacking tech continue to see moore's law advancements?
These are all highly philosophical questions that cannot be answered, only speculated upon, but it should give you a good idea of how complex the realities are of our community, and the challenges we face.
**Will bitcoin remain anti-fragile?**

His [last github commit was in april](
And his [last blog post was about Craig Wright being satoshi](
I think after some thought on the subject, he has done what was best....stayed the fuck away from bitcoin. I cannot say what went on between them, but considering all of the hindsight vision we have on the subject, its crystal fucking clear that Craig Wright is not satoshi and is just a very good scammer.
Every single promise he has made has never come true. The magician can only keep up his act if he can keep up belief. No one any longer believes in him, so the burden of proof is much higher, its *cryptographic* proof that require that he has not provided.
Dude can setup a patched electrum, MITM attack and spoof signatures in a real face to face demo to fool one person in a appeal to authority, but what he cannot do is sign a simple message for the world to see.

How the fuck do you think consensus is reached in any environment?
Yes, there are people that matter more in the bitcoin world. Its a good thing to have discussion on issues because those people are influenced by those discussions. They can also gauge the way users feel, and then change directions based on the best outcome.

This is great and exactly what we need. Im not a scientist and I don't claim to be an expert, but even a layman can interpret and extrapolate from the [coinshares mining research paper]( on what the real costs and effects of mining are, as well as why all the media hype is BS.
As an example for understanding -


production at ¢5/KWh and 18-month capex
depreciation now stands at approximately
$8,500 
Which means that...
the backdrop of no reduction in global hashrate
we take this to mean that the average miner is
either: running at a loss and unable to recover
capex, mining at electricity prices closer to ¢3/
KWh, depreciating mining gear over 24-30
months, or paying less for mining gear than our
Considering today we have a bitcoin price floating around $3400, with a estimated cost of $8,500 at 5c / KWh, this means that in order for miners to stay profitable they need to be mining at cost of sub 3c / KWh and/or paying substantially less for their mining gear.
This means that it is economically impossible for bitcoin mining to exist as a profitable venture without pre-negotiated bulk excess hydroelectric power costs. I've seen other sources mention costs as low as 2.6c / KWh in Sichuan locations. I think its safe to presume that large mining colo's have negotiated similar price deals for excess power.
It is definitely a reasonable assumption that reduction of excess power in Sichuan could result in increased costs for locals as diminished excess does have a impact upon prices. I do however see this as a more-than-fair tradeoff that allows for mining to exist in a economic environment that rewards utilizing renewable energy power sources, as this is the main argument against bitcoin - That it is a climate change contributor.
But bitcoin cannot exist in its current form utilizing dirty energy sources. Its too expensive. Miners will quickly fail attempting to use the retail market as a means to profit off bitcoin, e.g. buying equipment at retail prices, mining at retail electric costs.
Also important to note this theory/model of miners being forced to geolocate into cheap renewable hydroelectric goes away as bitcoin prices goes up. Of course its still more economically feasible for miners to reduce costs as much as possible, therefore geolocation is still a consideration, but as margin increases it becomes less of a "do or die" scenario, which is what we know ultimately creates very low margin industries that benefit the consumer (highly competitive markets, and in this case, the consumer is the average bitcoin user or business that relies upon bitcoin activity, ensuring that a network remains both secure and cheap to utilize).

The internet is a network, not a market. It is therefore composed of endless markets, it is the network of networks, literally. The internet is just a mesh of various states communication networks pieced together so that we can all communicate across one medium.
What we could consider as "The internet market", would be ISP's, domain providers, DNS providers, colo's, and all of the various contractors within that market that cover the endless millions of small tasks.
Now for you analogy to hold true, ask yourself -
Are the business models of these ISP's regulated? Is Level3 regulated? Are the services that are covered for this entire huge array of "the internet" regulated?
The answer is obviously yes, and therefore not a free market.
If you were to ask me "Is the internet *state-less*", then I think we could have a more interesting discussion, but that is outside this current talk of free markets. 
But all of this is besides the point. I should have been more clear in the statement that you quoted. It was intended, as should be clear given the context it was said with, that I meant by "society" as "a governed society". I was specifically talking about government and free markets, and challenged that statement on that basis.

You do realize that you are making the same argument Paul Krugman makes right?
Its basically this -
"We already have a system that works, why do we need bitcoin?"
Good luck with your bank shilling.


So says the monarcy about the peons. Im pretty sure that people want and *deserve* liberty, regardless of their level of education. Bitcoin is about financial liberty, not about being the next competitor to mastercard. People will always be stupid enough to be convinced to vote against their best interest.
Your argument is basically "people are dumb, so this doesn't matter".
I reject such nonsense.


How long did it take the internet to be adopted by the masses? ARPA was in the 70's. I didn't get a dial up modem until the late 90's, and I was *ahead of the curve*. Most people had commonplace internet DSL in the early 2000's.
I think you are being unrealistic in terms of technology maturity, adoption curves and utility. cryptocurrencies have nothing but a linear upward trajectory in terms of usage, adoption and investment. This lack of perspective is quite common in uneducated individuals shitposting here.
Its like complaining you cannot the massive 3 billion dollar freeway overpass project thats being constructed *while* its being constructed. With bitcoin, it was *immediately* usable, if clunky. And its gotten significantly less clunky, and continues to progress. Eventually, parity will be reached in terms of utility and cost, and your argument will be insignificant. However, in order for me to prove you wrong, I will have to put a 5 year reminder on this post, which you will have long forgotten and your account obselete. I will just say this - You are wrong, time will show it and nothing else can.


It can and does. Perhaps you've never heard of LN? I hear its all the rage now. I expect in 5 years it will be the most commonly transacted network in crypto-land.
You can have no vision and not understand technology curves, but I will continue realizing the obvious and trying to explain it to people who don't have vision. Not because im interested in changing your mind, but because your lack of depth on the subject may inadvertantly spoil someone elses opinion who is less educated and highly gullible to such nonsense.
Pretty much no one here tries to make the argument bitcoin is useful in 1st world banking countries *today*. Its not. It serves little purpose for domestic usage in 1st world countries *today* other than perhaps ordering stuff online that you cannot due to restrictions.
But it will in the future. And it already *is* useful today in cross-boarder applications. Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.

We are not talking about small percentage increase here we are talking about massive overpayments.
That directly implies either a lack of education or a lack of education combined with faulty software. It's really clear that a lot of people are paying high fees by mistake.

Yes. When I first thought "Holy shit he got rekt" this point is what entered into my mind. He is such a egomaniac he thought he could create a consortium to control bitcoin. When he got blocked thanks for grassroots movements like UASF, he was the catalyst that launched Bitcoin ABC. 
To this day I am 100% convinced that the only reason Bitcoin ABC exists is because of Jihan Wu's pride. I even recall the bitmain blog post where he threatened to launch another client pre-bitcoin ABC, and then right when all the s2x drama ended bam, bitcoin ABC launches. Like, we are supposed to believe thats just a coincedence?
He wasn't just a vocal threat to bitcoin, he established and sought to completely control bch, a direct competitor of bitcoin, and tried as hard as he could to attack bitcoin socially while engineering corporations to take control of the bch enterprise.
Fuck this guy to death im so glad his ship is sinking. This is what happens when you choose corporate central control over decentralization. You get greedy fucks high on power who do enormously stupid shit.

While this may hold some truth to new technologies that need to be bootstrapped, one could argue that bitcoin has a huge jump start by piggybacking on pre-existing infrastructure. 
Bitcoin, its primary use case being money-over-ip, uses  the internet to accomplish its goal.
I think it would be more accurate to compare bitcoin to VOIP. It was first used commercially in 1995 (though invented much earlier), and 20 years later we have browsers with built-in VOIP and call centers around the world use VOIP over existing landlines for economic reasons.
Similarly, I see bitcoin as being on a 20 year timetable to integrate into the hive mind of society, with the first 10-15 years used to really buff the technology to make it more efficient and user friendly.
Just like VOIP, which could be used in the 90's though many didn't (I did!), bitcoin can be used during its incubator stages.
I would argue that bitcoin is much more effective in its  baby steps than VOIP ever was. The amount of capital invested into its infrastructure also dwarfs VOIP in its first 10 years, so we can reasonably expect it to leapfrog comparatively to VOIP.

If you review my comments, I didn't dismiss it. I countered some highly editorialized opinions about "btc not being able to compete" with DAG's, which is obviously ubber rubbish.
I think there are plenty of applications for DAG's, but securing commodities or anything of real value is not it. DAG's are "lightweight" crypto-ledgers that are great for recording and timestamping information, but the security model is not anywhere near ready to protect *real* wealth. And by real wealth I don't mean the artificial value of 100% premines (ripple) or 97% premines (stellar). The "value" of these items are manipulated through restricted supply because of the centrally controlled source of tokens. When I say real value, I mean crypto-commodities which are *mined* through a mechanism that trades value for value.
Bitcoin, unlike any of these DAG's, is *actually* backed by something, aka is POW system that converts commodities (energy) using a super computer network 100's of times faster than the largest known super computer network on the planet.
I cannot argue to the efficiency of it, its a incredibly resource intensive process, but it is generating much more wealth than it is costing by creating an entire new economy surrounding it. BTC has also become the reserve currency of all other crypto's, making it a defacto king for a lonnnnnng time. Even if a DAG based crypto proves to be a better functioning crypto-ledger, it will take at least 3-5 years before the market responds to such a shift.


And who stores all this information? What benefit is it to them? How are they rewarded, and how is this model sustainable in the long term?
Anyone can make a shitcoin today that can replace bitcoin's scaling issues by offering a less used system that doesn't have the intensive resource requirements that btc does. But the real question is how is this system designed to last?

Jokes aside I think that we should also talk about the negative aspects of etf's as well. While it may be a positive that having a custodian hold your Bitcoin for you reduces liability on the investors and it also increases centralization as well as giving the ETFs the ability to move market price.
Things start to get confusing when there are multiple forms of the same assets. Which should lead the market? Should it be the traditional Bitcoin exchanges? Or should it be traditional Financial exchanges trading ETFs?
It has always seemed apparent to me that an ETF should be following the market prices that are set on exchanges, and not the other way around. But I feel like the tree is going to get too big for the forest and the ETF eventually might impact market prices through its trading swings, the same way that paper gold has affected physical gold.
@_date: 2018-03-01 01:20:35


It doesn't have to. Things like nano, ripple, stellar and all these other DAG's are not token's of **value** but are instead merely ledgers.
This is fine for centralized authorities to use to track information as it moves across the DAG, but if you think that valueless tokens which are run by non-decentralized networks are going to "replace" bitcoin, then you clearly don't understand what makes bitcoin valuable in the first place. Im highly skeptical of non-decentralized systems holding strong against nation state attacks, let alone run-of-the-mill corruption that will undoubtably occur within these systems themselves. I mean c'mon the Ripple CEO owns 60% of XRP, are we supposed to believe a system controlled by one person is stable? How are any of these DAG systems different? There's no economic system that sustains the security, which is why PoW is so important.
These are also widely untested idea's which have not held any value whatsoever in real marketplaces. DAG based "cryptocurrencies" (more like cryptoledgers) are worthless until they prove that they can sustain nation-level attacks, something that bitcoin has done for the past 9 years.
Bitcoin is a crypto-commodity. These DAG based **token systems** are *not* commodities.

As someone who has printed many, many emails, im not so sure your point is 100% correct. Or it severely depends upon what you mean by "in time". If you mean 10-40 years then im gonna give you a nope dawg. *Maybe* if we are talking 50+ years from now .....
In a business environment you often put paper into peoples hands because its easier than having everyone have their own personal laptop, tablet, whatever for the meeting. Im a super technolgist who would never print a email for himself, but the demands of a corporate environment are not about what I need, but about what is most efficient for many (for that meeting per say).
The business world is what churns the most email/paper, so we have to consider that in the future businesses will be a large part of the crypto ecosystem.
I get your point, im just not sure its as strong as you think it is. It has a maximal feeling to it, when it should really be considered in terms of a ratio, one that slowly changes over decades. Maybe crypto vs usd use is 0.000000000000000000001:1 today, and it might lose a decimal or two in the next year, but its going to be slow going.
I also used to work in the reprographic industry, so im quite familiar with exactly how much paper businesses still use *today*. Lets just say Dunder Mifflin paper aint going out of business anytime soon, regardless of how many people use email.
I still have to tell businesses on a weekly basis that I refuse to send them faxes and that when they are serious about doing business with clients they can forward me their email.
We live in a society that takes *many* generations for legacy technology to disappear. Fax has been outdated for nearly 2 decades now and the entire medical and financial industry *still* relies upon it.
Why should we assume the same wont apply to dollars vs bitcoin? Maybe you are right in that we will have more options in exchanging btc for goods, but there will *always* be a dependency on USD in our lifetimes.
Im surprised no one has brought up these points. There must not be many people who have been upper management or executives in corporate environments, because printing emails is not all that uncommon, as stupid as it sounds.

Segwit, which just activated fixes transaction malleability which was preventing LN from operating efficiently. LN is a add-on to the bitcoin network at a layer above the protocol level and is not a bitcoin protocol upgrade. Segwit was.
You can think of it like being HTTP on top of tcp/ip. tcp/ip is the base layer protocol that allows hardware to communicate with each other. But http expands the capabilities and allows for all these fancy new features to be utilized, but the packets http creates still utilizes the tcp/ip protocol, just like LN creates new fancy ways to transact, but still needs to utilize the basic 1st layer bitcoin protocols to operate.

Stop drinking the koolaid. Your party of selfish amoralists has exploited the world for long enough. The selfish idealism of Ayn Rand has been destroyed by the real academic Giants (piketty) using big data science to prove the positive feedback loop of investment and consumer/citizen regulation. Aka capital based market economies with socialistic governments. Yes, governments that actually do their jobs providing for the people instead of exploiting them with division politics to gain control and enrichen thselves.

while it may be true that the prosecutors went hard on that narrative I think it's important to recognize that he really did try to have people killed.
This fact is irreconcilable with people of every type of culture or ideology.
I have a little problem with him running a drug Market because I think drugs should be legal and the only reason they're legal is to continue the money train for those in power. so I don't think that he deserves any amount of jail time for running a market.
had they just prosecuted him based on the murder-for-hire charge than I would have actually been okay with whatever sentence they gave him.
The problem is they didn't go after him for that and instead they went after him purely for drug-related charges.

I think the issue is that a lot of services with pro-privacy mentality dont exist. So you are forced to utilize the services that exist. The exit strategy does not work in this situation.
For example if you want to sign up for a email account, most providers want your phone number now. This service would be a good case use to sign up for those services without needing to provide them a piece of your identity. 
Its not wrong to want privacy. Its been shown over and over that these centralized services all get hacked and then all of your information gets dumped on the internet.

Which to me is exactly why there needs to be a small amount of prosocial regulation. There is plenty of empirical evidence from economist piketty that regulation enacted to favor public benefit actually works towards the betterment of society. I know libertarians and some people on the right are having their heads explode reading this but facts are facts.
People are fucking dumb. You never going to change that. Money can't be sound if it's getting stolen or people are getting scammed out of their money constantly.
If you truly want to understand just think if there were no laws related to counterfeiting USD. Imagine if it was up to the "free market" to take care of all of the counterfeit.
imagine how often everyone would get screwed when they received counterfeit and then couldn't do anything with it. It would have enormous far-reaching economic consequences from macro perspective.
Proof of work resolves the double spend problem from a technological counterfeiting perspective but it does not magically eliminate the problem from society as this post demonstrates.
The only way the "free market" can be effective in this regard is if there is widespread education. funny enough that's exactly what people on the right are fighting against by electing representatives who would rather see whitebeard in the sky become the main form of education. So the only solution to make this market system work is also rejected by the same people that believe the market is a means to fix this unsolvable problem.
It's a rather stupid circular argument.

People can pretend that they are living in a lawless society, but those who trip up the law will find out the hard way that the law has real physical ramifications.
I would just say its a *lot* more complicated than that. Bitcoin is a trojan horse that needs to be embedded into society for it to accomplish its goal. The more that politicians help this process, the better that bitcoin accomplishes its goal.
This is just one step in many into legitimizing bitcoin in the eyes of lawmakers for daily usage.
This is only good for bitcoin.

I'm not sure where you're getting your facts from that but that doesn't seem true. The reason horizontal scaling has maximum benefit for Google is because of geolocation. Servers connected and racks with low latency will always perform better as a mesh-net then servers physically located on opposite ends of the Earth.


I think the problem here is that you are confusing singular entities versus the network. yes when you are taking a top down view obviously a decentralized network scales horizontally. So yes both centralized and decentralized networks scale both horizontally and vertically.
the difference here is whether the individual scales horizontally or vertically.
When the individual scales vertically in a decentralized network its effects are diminished because of the nature of a decentralized network. If an individual scales horizontally in a decentralized network it's probably a waste of bandwidth and resources.
Unless other participants in the network also scale vertically at the same time then the decentralized network doesn't reap the benefits until a higher propagation of vertical scaling.

Trust me, when I wrote that comment I knew someone would misconstrue it.
If all of the people doing the peer-review and the verifying are also colluding in some form of corruption then you have yourself a project that does something other than what people think it does.
The point was to emphasize that 99.9999999% of people who use Bitcoin are not programmers let alone cryptographers at such a high level that they can peer review all of the source code in Bitcoin core. If they really really feel untrustworthy about the people who designed the service then they probably shouldn't use that service.
This is just plain common sense I understand that Bitcoin is open-source and that others will review it and find flaws. My advice still stands regardless of that fact.

According to [this comment]( im not sure its possible short term.
Greg seems to imply that due to limitations CT is not possible on bitcoin. Which is why liquid is designed differently. Im unsure the engineering tradeoffs to make bitcoin compatible with CT, but I would assume it would mean large increases to blockchain bloat. Hopefully in the future when schnorr is implemented we will see CT become a possibility on-chain.

No, its not.... ? If manufacturers are blocked from doing covert AB because of bitmain's chinese patents, and they cannot do it with version rolling AB because of the previous patent....then that would mean no asicboost on other machines.
By allowing version rolling AB in dragonmint they are able to compete with bitmain's covert AB now. Even better, they can do it and mine SW blocks, giving them an advantage over covert AB.
Its actually **exactly** what we need, since the last thing we want is to encourage manufacturers to hold patents on modifications that increase their hashing power *but to the detriment of the network* with empty blocks and no segwit.

Don't you find it difficult to say that with a straight face? If you and all these companies claim to represent such a majority of the community than how hard is it to poll your users to ask them these questions?
But the fact that you have not tried to poll any of these people quite adequately demonstrates that you don't really care about where the consensus is and you think that these companies can force consensus upon all of these users. You think that merely because Executives of a business sign an agreement that the users will comply with that decision. That is such a backwards line of thinking considering the history of all Industries and markets. 
You completely ignore the fact that your changes have a ecosystem wide impact upon all users regardless of which Fork they choose and even more so considering that your implementation is contentious and does not implement replay attack protection.
I think it's quite obvious to everyone here that you got caught in a hypocritical action and you are now trying to backpedal out of that statement by changing the definitions and terms.

Good response, thanks!
LOL @ Sarah Jeong. As a white dude I actually find her commentary fucking hilarious. Are white nationalists really upset by her condemnation of white people? A lot of what she says isn't untrue, its just that she doesn't try to hide her bias.
I actually have *some* respect for that. Just like I have a respect for black civil rights leaders putting sunlight on issues throughout white society and not trying to hide for cover. Keep in mind I emphasized 'some' because its context sensitive so some things she says im ok with and others I would challenge her on.
Its different when white people don't hide their racism against black people because they clearly *are* the victims, constantly, at white peoples hands, and have been for how many thousands of years? At one hand I despise the blantant abuse of authoritarians using their racial perception as a spear in the open, and on the other I like that we have something visible to attack.


These groups/processes exist because these groups are unfairly marginalized in socities. Pretending they are not doesn't accomplish anything.


I don't agree with this and I think its wrong.


I don't disagree though its a context sensitive discussion. Incredibly difficult to craft macro policy 'based on the individual'. We have to create legislature and constitutions that generalize. But I do strongly believe in [Technocracy]( and this system should be how we elect representatives, leaders and employee's.
Also I've just realized you've created a false dilemma in your past commentary.


This isn't a either/or situation. Condoning white nationalism or a white ethnostate is not right and should be rejected on the face of the premise. I do agree that going extreme on the left and creating diversity programs to financially reward those who do not deserve it (e.g. no experience), and this ideology should also be rejected on the face of the premise.
But definitely not 'one way or the other' scenario. We can have both a society that rejects white ethnostate ideology as well as extreme left leaning policies. When I say 'extreme' i mean things like this racial profiling. What ideologies are absolutely **not** extreme are universal healthcare and regulation of industries to prevent monopolizations that endanger health, prioritizing profits over people.

I think people are often confused by the term "Money Laundering". I was for most of my life until I got into the bitcoin ecosphere. It came up so often by the media that I was finally investigated myself.
Money laundering is a way to legitimize illegitimate funds. 
So, if bitcoin were a tool for money laundering, can someone please explain how it helps with the process of taking "bad" money, and turning it "good" ? When money appears out of nowhere, you have to provide documentation to prove where it came from. How does bitcoin aid this process?
I would think that if anything, bitcoin would complicate this process. Say you kept your bitcoin at some exchange or wallet provider that you had mined previously. Then that site disappeared, like so many have before.  But you got your bitcoin out before it disappeared.
How can you prove where your bitcoin came from? That organization that disappeared basically created a black hole. If its like any other exchange, then the btc you put in would be unconnected to the btc you got out, making the paper trail obscured.
Or what if you just mined it and then held it for years? How are you going to prove its not subject to short term capital gains tax? Does the IRS accept blockchain history as proof of holding? If you transferred btc from one wallet to another, would this count as a "sale" and then reset the clock on the capital gains?
What if you wanted to prove this income for a house purchase? You would be shit out of luck, not even able to use your own money in a   "free" society.
Im willing to challenge my beliefs, that bitcoin *can* be used as a money laundering technique, but I've not seen a single case use where this is actually feasible.

No. You couldn't be more wrong. This isn't about writing a piece of software, this is about creating a entire network. This is not just about one task, this is about creating a network of tasks that all work together.
Your perverse logic that it would make sense to create scaling solutions for entirely unneeded load is absurd. They will get it functional first, and then they will worry about the fine details, such as "scaling to a billion nodes" after. Are you *really* suggesting that they should write code to scale to a billion nodes now, when there is literally 5200 bitcoin nodes in existence?

There are no simple solutions to complex problems. Anyone who tries to say otherwise is ignorant.


Fee's are a reality of bitcoin. Whoever sold you on the "free lunch" mentality did not speak for bitcoin or bitcoins long term survival. Fee's are necessary to ensure bitcoins security mechanism. Any business who built their plan on bitcoin having free transactions were weak entities that deserved to be eliminated out of the ecosystem. It was poor planning on their end.
But, I find it funny you bring up this topic. Because those $10 USD fee's you speak of? [They were artificial](
And [antpool got caught red handed collecting some of those spam tx's](
Maybe instead of blaming open source developers for contributing their time you should instead be asking Bitmain, Antpool and Roger Ver why they are actively engaged at sabotaging bitcoin? You have your finger pointed in the wrong direction.


Funny you are using the logic that was the entire reason we had segwit *in the first place*. Segwit *buys us enough time so this never happens again until second layer solutions are ready*.
What evidence do you have that transactional growth will outpace the space savings Segwit *is already offering* ? Are blocks full? No? Is mempool full? No.
You have zero evidence to support such a ridiculous theory.
The truth is that the people you support are consistently attacking the bitcoin network in an attempt to subvert development to further centralize their control. They already have mining, mining manufacturing, and now a bitcoin-altcoin.
What better way to propagandize a cult of people to your cause than erecting a boogeyman, and then claiming that you have the cure to ward off the boogeyman? This is the same actions of an authoritarian regime. Its the old "We need to sacrifice your liberties for your security" argument that has occurred over history century after century.
And you are dumb enough to fall for it.
Bitcoin would have been fine these past few years if it wasn't for the people you are supporting attacking the network. There is plenty of evidence of this. We don't need to speculate, we *know* that these attacks have occurred consistently over the last few years.

When powerful central allies collude to bypass decentralization, it is absolutely an attack on the Bitcoin network as a whole.
Have you already forgotten that you **personally** pushed the "Segwit2x has consensus" **lie**? And then you quickly back pedaled only once you realized your fork was a catastrophic failure that not only didn't have anywhere near the consensus needed to upgrade a global network, but the code was so much shit that it stalled one block before the fork due to a rookie OBOE mistake.
How in the fuck can you post here claiming that it was not an attack? Seriously dude, *get the fuck out of here*. No really.....leave. People like you were part of the largest coordinated attack on the Bitcoin network and you fought it publicly and you have the audacity to come here and post claiming innocence?

Im assuming you mean nakamoto consensus as "network consensus". 
Remember that nakamoto consensus is the "Longest **valid** chain". 
If industry members get together in a room, decide on some rule changes, gather enough mining hashpower to force the rule upon the users of the network, all they are doing is creating a new blockchain with invalid rules and convincing a portion of the mining industry to leave bitcoin and mine their new coin, just like with bcash.
So long as the users continue to sustain the legacy chain with the valid rules, then that new blockchain is simply trying to take over the legacy chain.
As previously explained, social consensus is higher on the ladder of the decision tree. It determines the nakamoto consensus. So if you compromise enough people from the social vector, you can alter the nakamoto consensus.
This is why bitcoin was designed to remain decentralized. So that central entities cannot collude to force invalid rules upon the rest of the network. That absolutely is a form of an attack.


I see this common misperception often repeated. Bitcoin is not a democracy, its a capitalist system. Miners follow the money and mine based on profits. Thats *very* different from a democratic system where citizens vote for government representatives who's sole purpose is to represent them. Also it is not analogous to say miners vote. They dont vote, they merely signal preference. When it comes to choosing which blockchain to mine, they are making business decisions. Call it voting with your wallet if you wish, but I dont prefer the analogy when it comes to voting/miners.
Government is a debt based system. Bitcoin is not.


Define "system majority". I see more people against S2X than for. The majority of the ecosystem has **not** signed off on S2X. Do not confuse miners for the ecosystem. Also bitcoin is not a democracy, there is not democratically elected anything in bitcoinland.
Miners follow the money. The users determine market price. So miners follow the chain that users decide to use. That puts users higher up on the decision tree chain. You have to think of this like a tree chart. Who's at the top? Users are the very peak of the tree. They ultimately decide which way everyone goes.
Businesses merely represent users interests. If they don't then users will stop using them. Miners follow the money, which is created by the economic activity created by the users.
Developers are somewhere between users and miners. They create fundamental infrastructure and therefore have enormous social influence. Social influence comes before nakamoto consensus. 
Social influence can be a game changer, as we've seen in a thousand different markets/industries. 
What you are seeing right now in the S2X camp is that social influence at play. S2X is non-existent right now. You cannot claim nakamoto consensus has influenced anything because we've yet to hardfork.
So every single opinion you've formed about S2X is built upon the social consensus layer im speaking about. Obviously it must be very powerful because here you are trying to argue for it, when the nakamoto consensus has not even been given a chance yet.
I think you'll find the nakamoto consensus to be quite resilliant, despite the brute force power of industry members. If a large enough faction colludes to change the rules, they can convince a large subset of users to follow their new rules, hence you here shitposting right now.
But this doesn't make their hardfork bitcoin. The only way S2X becomes bitcoin is if the majority of users **abandon** the legacy chain and use S2X instead. There are fundamental reasons behind this move. With the capital flight will come the economic activity. With the economic activity will come the price increase. With the price increase will come mining support, and so on.
But ultimately its the *users* who decide the fate of bitcoin. Miners are merely timestamping and ordering transactions. If users decide to engage only on the legacy network then it doesn't matter how many miners mine S2X, their blocks will be rejected by nodes that are engaged in the economic activity.
People like bitpay are going to learn a very hard lesson in all of this. 
EDIT - I've just realized that my position is also backed up Balaji's recent 21 co [post](




So, using his terminology, there are subsystems/layers within the bitcoin ecosystem that are not directly connected to the bitcoin protocol (developers, payment processors, exchanges, etc) but compromising these central entities through social means can have great influence upon the outcome of the nakamoto consensus/protocol.
Ignoring this is ignoring the last 100 years of civilization. He who controls the media controls the people. You can influence a presidential election through twitter/facebook/grassroots movements. Convince enough people in positions of central authority to back your position and you can start a huge movement that hijacks the status quo. This can and is often done maliciously and *not for the benefit of the people within the system*.
Convincing enough half retarded citizens to vote for a shitty president may make that person the "president", but it will *not make the system better*. Ultimately, whats important, is that the system functions well and to the best benefit of the users within the system. That is not going to be done when a bunch of CEO's who know next to fucking nothing about bitcoin get together in a room and decide the future for everyone, *all while ignoring 99% of experts on the issue*. Thats not a rational long-term future planning process that will benefit the people. Thats called reckless posturing.

Provide examples.
Im saying it as simply as I can - Moore's law has had little to no effect upon bitcoin because it has mostly slowed to nothing since bitcoin has been released.  This "doubling every 2 years" has not occurred.
Show me the **proof**.
Because [basic googling]( can show you that the history of preformance progress has drastically slowed in nearly every single sector.
Its not just CPU. Its also RAM and bandwidth. I have the same amount of RAM in my desktop PC as I did in 2009. I also have the same exact amount of mbits for my consumer broadband connection today as I did in 2009.
This "doubling" that you speak of has not occurred in any relevant field, be it RAM, CPU, HD Space or Bandwidth.
We *might* have had a 2x fold in the last 9 years since bitcoin was released. And thats a strong "maybe". But definitely not every 18-24 months, which is what moore's law states.
Go ahead, prove me wrong. Show me the money. Show me the speeds. 
The fact is that moore's law has died. Its no longer a relevant metric in which we can estimate future progress. Especially not in monopolistically constrained markets like our broadband infrastructure where not only are we not getting very much faster, but we are instead seeing our liberties being shaved away with data caps as conglomerates increasingly squeeze the market dry for profits.

No, he really does.
He quite adequately demonstrated right there that he believes miners are the ones who create the rules. You cannot think that and then think at the same time that its the users who set the rules.
If you work through the chain of logic, its quite apparent that he thinks miners are *above* users on the decision-tree.
This demonstrates Erik fundamentally does not understand how bitcoin works. 
We should not look to these people on the future of bitcoin. These are parasites in the ecosystem looking to milk as much revenue out of the system before the system changes and makes their business plans obsolete.

I never stated, nor implied that it should be immune to change. The heart of the discussion was using a central authority to dictate that change. That is the opposite of bitcoins consensus mechanism, which is achieved "in the rear" as opposed to "on the front".
Its important to keep the context in mind while we are discussing this. The context is a "leader" (vitalik) who advocated to *remove a core principal of the system*(immutability) while at the same time *not introducing any features*.
If you analyze the actions here, and perhaps frame it from a perspective of the bill of rights, the scenario makes more sense.
The bill of rights are rights that are granted to you. Lets think of them as a positive-right because it grants you privilege. Laws that are enacted (regulations) post-bill of rights are typically negative-laws, because they *remove privileges*. One action gives, the other takes.
In our example of vitalik is the main central authority of ETH, which is much different than bitcoin core where it has dozens of contributors, a much greater spread of individuals. He makes a bad investment into a buggy piece of software, and he advocated others to invest into this buggy software. Many large investors put a lot of money into this buggy software.
When the buggy software showed its bugs, he, from a main position of central authority, advocated that everyone do something that has always been held as unthinkable ....destroy immutability. Why? Well because of investors. And because he himself had put money in it. He had a incredibly biased perspective being personally involved into the contributions of that software.
So he wanted to take away something from ETH that has been a founding principal of cryptocurrencies.....*immutability*. 
And what was given in return? Well, money. But only to the investors of DAO. So he sacrificed a core principal of ETH for a mere "spin off" (we could think of it as a side chain perhaps, to frame the perspective)......which means that he removed a right from the bills of rights...and replaced it with......*nothing*.
Who cares about investors who are speculating in speculative assets? Thats gambling. And sometimes your gambling goes wrong. Thats the risk you take investing into really new fringe technology.
So, if you are going to utilize a social influence, from a position as a dictator, to "bail out" yourself and your buddies who *made a really bad decision*....you are doing several things. You are making your technology *fragile* instead of *anti-fragile*. You are setting a precedent by removing something that has been held as a sacred principal (or as constitutional amendment in the bill of rights), and all for what....a bail out?
Really? A bail out? .......
So if you keep the context in mind, the issue here is that he *immorally* used a *main central seat of power* (because he's really the only one), to influence everyone to make a change to a founding right of the system, to remove that right, and to replace it with nothing.
Thats *really really bad*. And if we have that shit happen with bitcoin, then good fucking luck. Bitcoin will die if it engages in that type of selfish deceptive behavior.
Now, none of this is to be confused with developers, as experts, debating the qualities of features vs bugs. This is not to be confused with say, Peter Todd and Jeff Garzik having a open debate on the mailing list over why they should or should not introduce a specific feature.
Those are part of the *positive* social construct and it does not interfere with *core principal values* of the system.
The bigger picture here is that just like the bill of rights, you have to setup historical precedent and rights/principals for bitcoin to operate. Some of these things are held sacred, because diluting these values would destroy the long term viability of bitcoin. As a example, a few would be -
21m coins
So what if today, peter todd came in and started advocating, for a reason that everyone knew to be because he had a personal financial interest to, to remove the 21m limit? 
But lets say that all of the core developers, and all of the exchanges, and main providers of services were all in on this and all had a financial advantage to change the limit. I know this does not make rational sense, because changing the limit would devalue coins so it would be less $ for everyone not more, but just assume that it doesn't for the example.
Assume that these people used their position of authority to attempt to change a core principal of the system. Specifically to *remove* a value from the system.
That of course would be *fucking horse shit* and no one would have it, right? That would be like the president of the united states, trying to *remove freedom of speech* by setting up a elaborate scheme to convince the public to vote against their best interests.
I understand that technically, IF the entire nation decided to vote against their best interest, it would *technically* be a democratic solution. And if the cabal convinced enough people to vote against their best interests to remove the 21m limit, technically consensus would be found if enough users upgraded to the new 21m limit changed version.
But that does NOT mean that the original behavior, the advocacy, the propaganda to enact the change, that this behavior is not vile, disgusting, immoral, etc.
We must recognize that society is filled with people who act selfishly. So we must hold our core principals very very dear to heart and resist those who try to change them. It sucks that everyone fell victim to vitalik's selfish scheming. They fucked a core principal of the system for literally nothing.
The issue is complex. Its not black and white. There's a lot of philosophy and you must know history and how history works over time in relationship to liberties to truly understand how important this is. 
If you allow people to erode the core values of the system, then eventually the system will collapse. Or, it will be co-opted by selfish or malicious actors. We need to preserve these principals and to keep on our toes so that this does not happen.

99.9% of core supporters want bigger blocks. They just want protections in place that does not put the system at risk and a cost benefit relationship that gives us more rewards than downfalls for increasing the blocksize. Here is a nearly [2 year old SegWit benefits explainer]( that goes into this...










bcash and S2X do not properly fix this issue, as it has been explained by core devs on the bitcoin dev mailing lists. There is a bandaid fix (limiting the size of tx to 1mb), but its superficial.

You are thinking in client mode. This is about nodes. I run one and saw it transfer 1.3tb in 2 months. That's well beyond the typical 300gb monthly limit some isps are implementing. And thats in *1st world countries* ...what hope do people in 3rd world countries have at running a node? You know...in the places where bitcoin will be most needed?
That's at 1mb block sizes. Resource usage is not linear. 1mb blocks don't equal 1mb of bandwidth. You have to do much much more as a node. Doubling doesn't just double your bandwidth. I don't think you understand this. It's exponential.

This means he is ethically compromised when it comes to fungibility protocol improvements.
It was blows my mind that the people most prone to conspiracy theory are typically ones that fear that the government is out to get them yet at the same time the same people are pandering to the actors who are most likely to help the government accomplish their dystopian goals.
It's almost as if...they have not spent any amount of time actually thinking through the positions they hold and instead love being told how to think.

All of these Investments you just spoke about are going to suffer massive losses during the next recession. That doesn't seem like a "safe" bet to me, especially since we are 2 years overdue for a 7-year recession bust cycle.
What Trump is doing with his budget will merely accelerate and increase the severity of the next recession.
This is good for Bitcoin of course but will be horrible to people like you who are advising traditional Investments, aside from gold. I think the takeaway, living in 2018, is that people are less interested in gold and are more interested in crypto commodities. We will see exorbitant gains in cryptocurrencies in the next recession but not nearly as many gains in the gold market comparatively.
Why don't you come back and post here during the next recession and let everyone know how well your Investment Portfolio is doing? We will then compare it to all of our crypto portfolios and we will see who gave the best advice.

While I agree with your logic, I also agree we should not be blaming bc.i.
For what their model is, they have done the best they could. Using their wallet is a trade-off between convenience and security. But if you are a capable user, then the trade off can be worth it.
For the average user who does not understand security, it's a bad wallet choice. For one that does, it isn't. You can use a VM or a live OS as your Bitcoin OS, both of which would be less likely compromised, assuming good practices on both, with the live OS being a superior between the two.
As an example how is installing Bitcoin core on Windows any better? The likelihood of someone getting a virus is equal to someone getting browser malware. Yet we would regularly advise people to install Bitcoin core over using bc.i and that doesn't seem very logical to me. Both would encourage user to access their keys on a unsafe system.
In the end I agree with the position that there is a net cost to advising the public to use a hot web wallet since it is not common for the average user to have safe security practices and the usage of compromise systems will definitely lead to compromise wallets. But that doesn't mean that you cannot do it safely or securely it just means that you need to be more knowledgeable than the average person on technology security.

and fee estimator sites like [21 co's]( still advising **300 sat/byte**. Frankly, I dont think people understand how to even read these sites. Currently there are 52962 tx's that are in the 1-30 sat/byte range that have confirmed today. The next closest range is the 181-210 segment with 32845 confirmed tx's.
This means that there are more smart people than stupid people. This is good I suppose. The *majority* of transactions are being sent in the 1-30 range. But there are still service providers that are defaulting to outrageous static fee's (*cough *cough*) that could be taking advantage of segwit and lower fee rates, contributing to the solution instead of the problem. Yes, im picking on you erik and will continue to do so until you get with the program.
This is why we must avoid centralization. The high fees have a circular effect when you have programmed the masses to visit these sites to determine what fee they should pay and when you have large service providers defaulting fee's instead of being economically rational.
Its a endless loop of madness.

F2pool abandoned the agreement. At most S2X has 85% of mining support, and thats just signaled intent. You dont know how many other pools or individual miners will say "fuck no way" when it comes to *actually mining and splitting bitcoin*.
This does not even touch the fact that miners *only job* is to order and timestamp transactions. They are a subset of the ecosystem. They are not the leaders, users are the leaders. Miners just follow the money. If btc becomes worthless, they will mine bch. If S2X becomes worthless they will mine btc.

I dont think anyone is saying that businesses should not be able to build upon bitcoins infrastructure. Of course they should and we want them too. But they dont control bitcoin.
And bitcoin does not *owe* them anything. Nor do bitcoiners. When one makes a business decision and puts capital towards building upon a new network thats a risk. It does not give these businesses any "right" to try to centralize fundamental decentralized aspects of bitcoin.
They do not get to "fire" open source developers and try to bully users by forcing them to use a alternative platform (segwit2x). Thats exactly what bitpay is doing by saying "We will run segwit2x". They are attempting to *force* their userbase to use their consensus breaking codebase in an attempt to force global network consensus on the issue.
Its complicated but if enough users go along with these changes then segwit2x will become bitcoin. Thats not "organic", thats industry executives colluding to control bitcoin. If enough business entities get together in a room and decide to force changes upon the network then a significant portion of the network will move with them. This is the entire reason that centralization is a threat to bitcoin. Because if enough operators centralize and control the network then they can pivot the network in any direction that suits their business best, regardless of what may be best for end users. Bitcoin was designed *to prevent exactly this from happening*. 
Thats not good for bitcoin. Thats really fucking bad for bitcoin. So how can we pretend that these companies are doing whats best for bitcoin when clearly a massive chaotic network split is whats worst for bitcoin?
And what is their rationale? What is their technical reasons? There are literally none. Fee's? Seriously? Thats what segwit + LN is for. We will have sub-satoshi transactions/fee's happening in 2019 once LN is matured.
Why fuck over the entire network out of non-technical reasoning, against the better advice of *literally all the experts in bitcoin* ?
This is a industry coup attempting to centralize development in a way that favors their short-term profit business models of onboarding more users.
Bitcoin is not theirs to change. They dont get to decide the rules. Fuck them for trying to cram a rushed sloppy hardfork down our throats by a shitty dev who's main source of business is tracking your activity.

Hopefully we can get all the other exchanges to announce their closures and we can finally get some peace in the Bitcoin ecosystem away from the constant manipulation out of China.
I doubt it though, I expect that this is just another charade and they will lift the ban in a few months after careful consideration and then maybe a few months later some other article that reverses the position and so on as they have done for the last 4 years.
I want to see this prescribed into law so that we can have finality about it. Everyone is so sick and fucking tired of China fucking with Bitcoin. I wish they would just ban it entirely. I wish I could that would ban manufacturing of Bitcoin equipment and the sale of Bitcoin and everything related to bitcoin.
China has been an enormous poison pill for Bitcoin and we are so done with it. The sooner we can get their meddling out of our ecosystem the better.

No. This is what I have found is to be the truth after half a decade of researching bitcoin. I have a professional background in IT for 15 years and have studied bitcoin since late 2012.
Academic research on the topic has more than adequately demonstrated that a raising of the blocksize greater than 4MB results in massive loss of decentralization. Bear in mind SW is a 4mb max blocksize upgrade, a *compromise* that Bitcoin Core made that all the evidence points to as being the maximum "safe" blocksize under current conditions. Unless you have some new RAM cache technology up your sleeve that quadruples preformance at under current consumer prices, then this evidence will remain valid for at least the next 5 years, if not 10. Im running approx the same CPU power, RAM and HD space as I was when bitcoin was released in 2009. Moore's law has fallen off the charts (in the context of being related to increasing preformance with a drop in prices) since 2010 and has not provided the evidence that satoshi speculated would come to pass.
See the [Cornell Study]( and the [bitfury study]( on increasing the blocksize, both of which come to similar conclusions. The Cornell study suggests that we should not increase the blockchain *beyond* 4mb because it would have a substantial negative effect upon decentralization. The bitfury paper, which is older and based on a more aggressive model, suggests that 75-80% of nodes would be lost at full/constant 4mb blocksize.
The scientific method (in this context) is about demonstrating through empirical evidence an outcome with set variables (Increasing the blocksize results in "x"). Replication of findings is what solidifies the certainty of a particular model or theory. Having the bitfury paper backed by a Cornell study without any reputable counter-opposing research to me provides an extremely high degree of certainty. 
If you cannot understand that bitcoins most valuable feature is decentralization, then you really dont belong here and should forget bitcoin and continue using paypal and your bank account. Bitcoin cannot exist unless it is anti-fragile and censorship-resistant. If you do not value these things then you should use central payment systems and forget about bitcoin.
Beyond academic studies on the effect of increasing the blocksize, aka 'on-chain scaling', there are *literally the most reputable, educated and experienced scientists, polymaths and engineers* that have stated point blank that bitcoin cannot scale on-chain without sacrificing its most fundamental value, aka security. Such as [Nick Szabo](


And [Adam Back](


Those two people alone are the most experienced and educated cryptocurrency PhD's in existence. Are you really trying to tell me that the people who are responsible for the technology that created bitcoin don't understand bitcoin? That they are wrong when they tell you point blank "Bitcoin cannot scale on-chain and remain decentralized" ?
If you want bitcoin to scale on-chain then the resource usage would be so high that it could only be consolidated in extremely expensive and large data centers. If bitcoin exists in data centers, it is not censorship-resistant. If bitcoin is not censorship-resistant, then bitcoin is not bitcoin.
You have the consensus on the issue by all experts. You have academic researching backing up their claims. Seriously, what more do you need? It seems glaringly obvious to me that most people who are on the big blocker side are not educated and are immune to education. They are so entrenched in philsophical and political ideology that facts and reason cannot seep into their brains. You will either believe the evidence or you will not, but please do not try to stipulate that some of the most educated people here are wrong, or "brainwashed" when the only people who are brainwashed are those uneducated folks making the accusations. In short, stop projecting and start doing research. Real research, not "im gonna shitpost on and live in a echochamber".

Wasn't the latest analysis by luke on transaction mix type suggestive that it would accommodate a 2.2mb blocksize?
This will of course only increase with time as well with schnorr + MAST.
I know its a theoretical size, but its a bit harsh to call it a "lie". Clearly he just does not understand. That 2.2 will eventually be 3mb+ as MS is increased and consolidated by MAST/Schnorr. 
So maybe give him a break and just correct him instead?
Either way, to the point of the OP, no one is against a doubling of the blocksize considering **thats exactly what segwit was** with even more room to grow as schnorr/MAST is implemented. Its a respectable and safe blocksize adjustment that tackles a numerous set of issues all in one fell swoop. From an engineering perspective, it was an excellent cost-benefit tradeoff.
The issue is the corporate takeover of bitcoin via backdoor room deals.
Bitcoin Core on the other hand does all PR in public, commits/changes on public github, with a 100% transparent process. Unlike the people trying to hijack bitcoin.

Yes, im well aware of **graphene*. When it actually gets utilized in commercial hardware then we can talk about the impacts it will have on the transistor industry.
But thats not tomorrow. We've got plenty of time to think about it.  I've been seeing the industry play up graphene for years now and I've not seen a single demonstration. I've been keeping up with the scientific literature on it, and its still in the incubator stages.
I think we are 5 years out until commercial products. 5 years is eons in the bitcoin world, just like 5 years to a 7 year old seems like 30 years to me as a adult.
If you really want to follow the progress of Graphene, you should follow the literature coming out of [leading scientists in the field]( like [Jamie Warner from Oxford](
In the mean time, sit back, relax, popcorn it up because throwing the word graphene is like talking about new battery tech or stable quantum computers. We will all believe it once its in our hands and doing something. Until that point, throwing the word around to make everyone believe that you know wtf you're talking about does nothing for the conversation but fog it up and create disillusionment.

You're missing the bigger picture here. There are always tradeoff's in the evolution of assets and marketplaces. Once bakkt launches there will be no reason for any institutional investment firms to not engage in the market.
Im not thinking about singular use cases here.
Im thinking about literal hundreds of millions of peoples income being able to be applied in small fractions towards "high risk" crypto-investment vehicles.
That means your neighbor's grandma, who doesn't even know wtf a bitcoin is can, and **will** have exposure to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. 
You're not thinking about the bigger picture of the investment umbrella that will cause macro-effects. We are talking billions with a B of exposure in terms of market volumes. Thats the positive trade-off that comes with institutional and fully regulated support in the marketplace. As well as less Mt Gox's.
The negative trade-off is for bitcoins soverignty as a payment network/currency. The more than we centralize and attempt to shoe horn the legacy system to be compatible with bitcoin, the more power we give over to regulatory institutions.

I have asked to coordinate polling with the CEO's of blockchain.info, coinbase and bitpay. All of these sites could provide sybil resistant polling that would reach **millions** of bitcoin users.
Bitpay could even have a poll per transaction, so that everytime you made a payment you could choose to vote on issues.
Claiming "All polls are rigged" while you *have the ability to conduct sybil resistant polling* is quite the pathetic excuse. How can you fail to see this logic? The truth is they know they dont have consensus and they know that if they conduct polls it will show how little confidence the public has in them. They don't want to shoot themselves in the foot by spreading sunlight on the truth.
Also, what happened to the truth often repeated in the early days, but rarely repeated now? Bitcoin [is supposed to be difficult to change]( thats a feature, not a bug.


This a false dichotomy. You clearly dont understand bitcoin if you try to apply that type of black and white thinking.
Bitcoin has multiple layers of consensus mechanisms. The *final* consensus mechanism is the nakamoto consensus, which is Adam Backs hashcash as a proof of work to determine the longest chain. Even then, [satoshi has admitted that a chain can be "longer" and yet **invalid**](
But the nakamoto consensus is not the *first* layer of consensus. The very first layer of consensus starts building at the open source (code) layer. Developers propose changes and then do cost/benefit analysis on tradeoffs. Whether concepts are merged depend upon expert analysis.
Then the next layer is the social layer. When developers wish to introduce changes to the network, they release the code and then the community debates the tradeoffs of the change. Keep in mind the engineers at this point have already (or are in progress of) debating these changes. Whether or not the change gets merged into the branch is a part of the first open source consensus layer.
But when it comes to actually deciding whether you wish to upgrade your software, that is a social process. You as individual human A, rely upon social networks of information in order to make decisions. These decisions are debated on github, reddit, bitcointalk, bitcoin.com and other various forums. You can ignore reality and pretend that the only reason we upgrade is because of nakamoto consensus, but the rest of us who actually understand bitcoin realize that its a organic evolution of decisions made by ten's or 100's of thousands of humans. 


No one is suggesting that we use twitter polls as a consensus mechanism. Stop strawmanning the situation. Twitter polls are not sybil resistant and I could care less about them. [Luke's Poll]( from coinbase is the only sybil resistant poll with valid data. The argument that "People dont trust luke" is irrelevant. We have industry executives who could choose to use their platforms for consensus building since they share large economic activity, and **yet they don't**. That should tell you right there that there is something wrong.
These are also companies who have mostly not contributed to protocol development. They instead wish to biggyback on the network, make profits off of the infrastructure the developers and users create, and then attempt to claim consensus on issues despite there being no evidence of said claims.
Also, 1 cpu 1 vote no longer exists. It died the day covert asicboost was created. We now have monopolies that have asserted control of manufacturing. These are the same mining cartels that are advocating for bitcoin cash. You really think these people are the friends of bitcoin while they are abandoning mining bitcoin to mine their shitcoin that they claim is the "real bitcoin" ? Thats some serious cognitive dissonance.


Absolutely reckless behavior. When you have large economic players in the industry unilaterally attempting to force invalid consensus rules on the rest of the network *with no consensus building mechanisms*, then that is an attack you should be fearful of.
This is the 51% attack we've all been worried about. Bitcoin has *always* been vulnerable to this type of attack. When large business or government subverts over 51% of the mining industry to force changes without consensus, that is exactly what a 51% attack is. This is why bitcoin always needed to remain decentralized. So we can't have CEO's of businesses and mining pools unilaterally deciding to change rules on the rest of the network.
This is a serious threat. Bitcoin may be anti-fragile in some ways, but it is not anti-fragile to 51% attacks. Its very vulnerable.
Fortunately, we know that miners are profit driven entities, so no matter how many of them agree to mine S2X when the difficulty readjusts on the legacy chain they will flock back. Im unsure how you could think that with all the innovation of protocol development happening on bitcoin core that people would not ultimately decide to use it long term. Yes, we may see a corporate hijacking of hashpower, but that will only cause short term abuse and chaos.


To the destruction of confidence in the bitcoin ecosystem? There are consequenes for a contentious hard fork. We've already see the chaos that bcash's EDA algorithm causes. Now you want a all at war in bitcoinland?
People like you should not be listened to. You are not rational people. You are like the drunk gun waiving confederates that think because they have bigger guns that they will win the war. No, your just a ignorant angry person with no long term vision and a lack of intellectual investment into the complex technology of a system we call "bitcoin".

Apples to oranges. No funds were stolen or returned. It's not the same kind of "hack".
In ETH, someone broke into the house and stole all the money. In BTC, someone  sat in their own home and printed new money.
The differences *are* important. In one, it was a bail out. In the other, it was fixing something that wasn't supposed to be. Believe it or not the way the contract was written for the DAO it actually really was written like that. This is the problem with eth, that the complex scripting allows for variables when not audited properly to be exploited. BTC was not written to have a few extra 10's of millions of BTC.
EDIT - I've realized that the breaking into the house to analogy is not quite accurate. In order for it to be accurate there would need to be a sign posted in the front of the house that basically says "if you can get into this house then you can take everything". That's how the DAO contract works.

Wrong. The industry is moving forward at a much higher accelerated pace than previous technological infrastructure advancements, and we should all be grateful that the public has been pouring so much money into the industry to increase that pace.
We are headed in that direction. There's no stopping it, just like there's no going back. Incumbents can clench their arthritic fingers onto legacy systems and lobby to force it down the public's throat for only so long. Eventually reality outpaces their dinosauristic mentalities.

For those wondering when the relevant part starts, its [here, where Jimmy Song recaps the miner HF discussion](
Here's my summary -
Bitfury, which controls 4.2% of the hashrate and is the only other current ASIC manufacturer/competitor to Bitmain has stated that the purpose of the S2X agreement was to prevent a chainsplit. If there is in fact a split because of the S2X hardfork, then bitfury said it is under no obligation to mine a specific chain. This implies they will choose to continue to mine the legacy chain, abandoning the S2X agreement.
This is the "out" that a lot of miners have been looking for. It was also explained by Jimmy extrapolating from Alex's (from bitfury) words, that most of the signatories of the S2X agreement were compromising for only a few people in the room who were demanding S2X, a act of good faith to prevent a split.
So its looking like it is only a minority of the S2X signatories that were demanding S2X, and that most of the signatories were just agreeing to compromise. With Bitfury's reasoning and public acknowledgement, I think this will have a significant effect upon other miners decision to stay/leave the S2X agreement.
Constantly evolving, but this *could* be the start of the end of S2X. We still have a solid 2 months for it to fall apart, so its good that this info is coming out now giving the community plenty of time to chew on it.
This feels like a much stronger case to make against S2X, and not the hyper-editorialized "bitmain employee proves bitmain/bcash connection".

This is the technical argument behind why S2X is a non-starter. This attack you speak of is a realistic scenario.
Do you design secure resiliant anti-fragile systems by introducing new attack vectors? Or do you do it by hardening your system and eliminating attack vectors? This fact alone presents the flawed theory for upgrading to S2X. It does not eliminate the quadric sigops vuln and only increases the attack surface.
Engineering yourself into weakness is moronic, but I would not expect such brilliance to be beneath garzik. He couldn't even get the variable correct on the start of the S2X repo, relying upon Core to fix his rookie mistake. This is the guy people want to be in charge of bitcoin?

I disagree. I see two participants in a conversation. One is engaging in good faith (adam) and the other is purposefully ignoring the content of the message and repeatedly attacking the position of the other without regard for what was said.
I don't really care what your opinion is if you cannot evaluate the information at hand and include it in your response.
I apologized to adam for people like you that are a complete intellectual brain drain. All you do is waste peoples time with complicated entrenched posts that are purposefully constructed to be as misleading as possible.
In short, I do not believe you are a sincere actor in this conversation. I say this because you've not put due consideration into the evidence supplied by the counterparty.
At best, you are just completely misguided. In either case, you are incorrect. You are attempting to dictate Adam's position in these agreements as if you were adam. On top of that you are alleging that his positions are directed because of his lack of participation in NYA, as if adam is driven by pride in these issues.


No, they have not. Im confident that every participant of the HK agreement has long broken their side of the agreement, except perhaps the core dev's who ended up [fulfilling their part of the bargain](
And its comments like these which strike me as pointing out you are a bad faith actor. Either you dont know the facts and you are naively accusing others of things that are not true, making you a time waster or you are trolling because you know the facts but it just doesn't fit in your narrow view so you ignore them.


For someone as involved in bitcoin as long as you have been, you are sure ignorant. You think a contentious hardfork is a way to prove the safety of hard forking? If you think S2X is non-contentious then you are living in a echo chamber and ignoring facts. Most major exchanges do not support S2X. That simple fact alone means there will be a catastrophic split. Add into the mix the fact that there is consensus amongst bitcoin experts that its dangerous, and you have even more evidence this hard fork will be with severe negative effects. Also add that most wallet software providers are against S2X and there is even more inarguable evidence this will result in a contentious hard fork.
Thats not just ignorant. Thats reckless. I cannot believe you are a good faith actor with such reckless/ignorant comments as this.

Are you denying the damage to the ecosystem that consensus-breaking alternative clients have wrought? Have you ignored the cause and effect of bitcoinXT, bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin ABC/Bcash and now S2X?
Just because I have faith in bitcoin does not mean that bitcoin is immune to social attack, especially elaborate industry lead ones. You would have to be an idiot to not realize this. This is why decentralization is so important, to safeguard bitcoin against these types of attacks.
You are only demonstrating you are entrenched in optimum bias. I am not like you, I dont think bitcoin is invincible. Just like democracy was never invincible. These systems are *designed* to be resilient against attack but if the population becomes apathetic or brainwashed by enough socially engineered attacks then the foundation of that anti-resilience will crumble. 
You can keep on thinking that bitcoin is invincible. I'll keep on doing my part to make sure that it stays *anti-fragile*. If more people become like you than people like me, bitcoin will eventually fail.
Remember this is just a system designed, orchestrated and ran by humans. The fact that its being ran on computers does not change the fact that humans control these computers. If you compromise enough of these humans, or enough of these machines, you can do incredible long lasting and irreversible damage to the ecosystem.
Bitcoin as a technical system is susceptible to a 51% attack from miners. Do you not realize that this same attack is also possible from users? All it takes is a majority of the economy to be convinced that shitcoin ABC is "the better path" and we will get led onto a path of weaker infrastructure. 
Sure, consensus can be met and if a majority agrees this new shitcoin is bitcoin then bitcoin it is! But that doesnt guarantee it wont fail. Changes that weaken the security model will crumble away at the foundations of its anti-fragility and will eventually whittle away enough that it is prone to large scale attack.
Security 101 dude.

Oh, but its "opt-in!" As *if* that resolves the problem in any coherent way. Its such a shitty PR stunt that its laughable. I could wish for to be ashamed of himself, but his ultimate purpose its an attempted industry takeover of bitcoin via miners. He doesn't want replay protection because he thinks the miners are the ace up his sleeve and will magically force everyone to S2X. Consensus means the vast majority of every sector within the bitcoin ecosystem coming to agreement. It *absolutely can happen* as we've seen with past upgrades. 
If bitcoin cannot survive this hostile takeover from industry then its doomed to follow the same path as ETH, a psuedo-decentralized cryptocoin that will have massive centralized attack vectors.

Why do you say this? What data is there to support this position? It appears to me the data shows blocksizes dropping and the lowest fee's we've seen in years.
We only have 5% transactional adoption of segwit at this point. What will the blocksize look like with 50 or 100% support? LN isn't even rolled out yet. What will blocksizes look like after 6 months of LN?
We now have [definitive proof that mining pools have been using spam transactions to stuff the blockchain](
Why would you ignore this evidence while pandering the "urgency" playing card?
Doesn't that feel intellectually dishonest to ignore evidence and to impress upon people that the situation is urgent when all the evidence supports that the situation is *not* urgent and that the need for urgency was manufactured?


It does appear that way. Lets be blunt, Garzik couldn't even figure out the right parameter to edit without core helping him out. That doesn't scream of competence. That screams of incompetence and a disaster awaiting us all down the line if we allow him to manage bitcoin. Im not saying he's not a smart guy. I used to support him. But history has shown that he's not smart enough to manage a project of this size and caliber. 
Also, competent engineers do not take the brakes off the train and then invite the public to ride on it. Engineers make slow methodical changes *after thorough testing phases* and then examine behaviors to assure safety. As you can see from the list of non-supporters of S2X the rushed HF plan has only assured that there will be a massive split and chaos.
What other competent engineers are there supporting SegWit2x? You threw the question out there so im interested in hearing your answers.

What other crypto's? Where are these crypto's accepted? What market cap and security do they offer? In order to use this argument, you must present a scenario in which one is benefitted from the switch. There must be advantages offered. Does Steam accept litecoin? ETH? No. 
I dont see anyone who is anyone accepting anything other than bitcoin. They currently *cannot* move to other crypto's because those other crypto's are far behind the infrastructure the bitcoin ecosphere has built.
This is changing yes, but no one else is anywhere near the market advantage bitcoin is currently sitting at.

Yes, its a little too simplistic to think of it this way. Byte counts also effect bandwidth, UTXO (RAM) along with HD space. 
People dont realize that resource usage is not linear in bitcoin. 1mb blocks do not equal 1MB of bandwidth or 1MB of RAM usage. When people try to paint things in simplistic terms they just confuse others and create misinformation on the topic.
For example, my node has sent over 1TB of bandwidth relaying blocks to nodes in the last 45 days. We technically only have 144MB of blocks on average per day. Yet my node has relayed a average of 22GB per day. Thats 152x more than the "144mb" of blocks that people would simplistically think is all your node would use.
And that 1mb block is using gigabytes of RAM for the UTXO, which is ever increasing and becoming even more of a RAM burden with BCH's oscillating EDA clusterfuck.
The requirements are more complex than people realize, and we need to plan properly so that people in 3rd world countries can run nodes for counterfeit protection. Its countries like Venezuela where we need people capable of running nodes.

these are merely tradeoff's. You are simply trading one security model for another, both which have negatives.
Right now, looking at bitcoin going 10 years strong without a single successful hostile takeover, its looking like PoW was an excellent choice. Even the largest mining subsidary in the world who had a massive monopoly on hardware *and* a huge boner intent to fuck bitcoin to death (and prop up BCH) couldn't successfully co-opt bitcoin.
Funny enough, i see PoS as the "high priests in command" structure that Jeff Garzik used to so vocally complain about when he fought against core developers in an attempt to [raise the blocksize to 32mb](
I believe its possible for a hybrid PoS/PoW model to be successful with "good enough" censorship resistance, but no one has proved this yet the same way that bitcoin has proved PoW works.
Take a look at [ETH's transaction costs]( sometime and tell me thats working. Clearly they suffer the same consequences that bitcoin does as well.

Thanks for explaining the obvious. All too often people get a hard-on for the term consensus in regards to the Nakamoto consensus mechanism and completely ignore that there is a social consensus layer in every system.
You would have to be living in quite the distorted reality to think that the social consensus layer has no relevant bearing upon the Nakamoto consensus layer. The social consensus layer is higher up on the tree of decision-making processes and greatly affects the results that henceforth happened on the Nakamoto consensus layer.
I hope you see the difference now , the world is not black and white and there are many layers.....

I agree that its cool these projects exist and im happy to see the experimentation. I love that ETH is doing PoS via Raiden. 
But these systems must withstand both academic and social debate on merits. Which is what we are doing now.
The problem I have is that I don't agree with the overarching theory this crypto uses. It presumes that this idea of having accountable witnesses is somehow secure because of economic factors. That is simply not true. The entire point of decentralization is to prevent **attack**. Centralizing your authorities and making them easy to attack makes your crypto insecure, regardless of how many moons are aligned to make the economic incentives perfect.


This is an example of what I am speaking of. It has nothing to do with any of this. It has to do with - Can a well funded organization, company, group, state.....succeed at compromising my network?
If you only have 12 witnesses, that answer is yes. There is nothing you can say to me that would convince me otherwise.
If this system is meant to be a mutable ledger, then I suppose thats a good tradeoff...but we already knew that because ripple paved the federated model way in 2012. There's always tradeoff benefits from centralization, but im uninterested in these things as they do not offer improvements to society.

When you are discussing engineering trade-offs you need to analyze the cost-benefit relationship of changes. What benefit does increasing the base block size to 2 megabytes bring and what cost is there?
Considering that we have multiple academic papers that demonstrate even small increases to the block size eliminate large swaths of decentralisation we understand the cost from an academic level. The cost is the elimination of security. What needs to be debated ultimately is how much security could be lost and still retain the censorship resistant properties. This is confounded by the creation of the altcoin bcash and the possibility of a split in hashpower.
So the question is what benefit do we gain from a doubling of the base block size that would outweigh the above cost? Well the first thing to consider is what would get this give us? The answer right now is absolutely nothing. We now have high-level statistical research from LaurentMT that demonstrated Bitcoin has been suffering from transactional attacks on the network whose sole purpose was simply too create low cost hi byte transactions that would clog the blockchain.
What prevents this behavior from getting out of hand is actually what the block size limit was put in place for in the first place, which was eliminating spam. If we raise the block size to deal with the spam then we only incentivize the behavior and encourage the behavior to continue to consolidate more resource usage. This Amplified Behavior than has a compounding effect on the elimination of security as has been demonstrated through academic research on loss of decentralisation by increasing resource usage on node operators.
We must also not ignore other facts that are inconvenient to us while considering whether or not there is a benefit to increasing the block size. For example we just underwent a block size increase which will see a slightly more than doubling of the current transactional capacity in the form of segwit.
So if we just underwent a doubling of capacity and fees are the lowest they've been in years block size is decreasing and we have multiple Technologies all which will further decrease the block size then what technical rationale do we have to sacrifice security?
The truthful and Technical answer is that we have no benefit whatsoever to making this change yet we have a high level of cost. Bitcoin can only scale at the level we needed to scale at through second layer Network Technologies. All experts agree on this fact you cannot scale the coin on chain without sacrificing the fundamental properties that make it valuable in the first place. 
People who don't understand Bitcoin constantly make this point of compromising while not understanding the technical engineering trade-offs. This is why open source projects are a meritocracy built by experts who understand the system and not by laymen who suffer from dunning-krugerism who think that they understand the system but grossly misrepresented constantly. 
As an example even I make mistakes when demonstrating my understanding for Bitcoin. I've been studying Bitcoin for years and have been highly active in this community and even I sometimes make dumb mistakes. Andreas A. Wrote "mastering Bitcoin" and even he had mistakes in his first publication. How can we expect people who have no reputation no intellectual investment into the technology to somehow dictate the rules of a highly complex decentralized Network?

I don't think you have the technical acumen to understand the difference here, so I will try to make it further clear to you. DAO was a contract that said implicitly "any variables within this contract are valid". It wasn't a "hack" it was someone taking advantage of a legal oversight. The rules were written into the contract and executing the contract based on the variables written within the contract was a valid action. The script and variables within the script are literally the legal contract.
Vitalik and Co decided they didn't want to lose money, so they bailed the network out. Remember who the biggest investors were.
In Bitcoin, there was only ever supposed to be 21m coins and everyone knows this. No one's BTC was stolen or returned with the soft fork. A bug was fixed.
This was responsible stewardship of the network. If you want this to be Apples to Apples then it would have to be a scenario like Bitcoin hard folk forking to bail out the mt gox hack.
Except that didn't happen.

Im not worried about insulting shitposters who spread misinformation and ignorance. To me you are a poison that must be eliminated from the body.


Bitcoins dominance dropped mostly because of ethereums gain in market value. Ethereum is a completely different use case than bitcoin. In bitcoin you pay btc as a transaction fee in exchange for some goods or services. In ethereum you are essentially paying for a program to execute. Bitcoin will be a censorship resistant decentralized currency/network, and ethereum will be a centralized corporate programmable blockchain. I am highlighting the differences for you so that you can *maybe* begin to understand that nothing bitcoin could have done would have changed the reality of ethereum gaining value. ETH gaining value = "bitcoins dominance dropping". 
For the others that have gained value, zcash, Dash, Monero, these all offer things that bitcoin currently cannot. But bitcoin cannot because of highly complex fundamental reasons. Changing fundamental basic protocol layer mechanisms is extremely difficult in a global network that is the most widely used, as we have seen over the last few year of HF drama.
But, to nail that point in deeper....*segwit* is what will *actually allow* bitcoin to adopt some of these privacy-enhancing technologies.
So your logic is basically..... "Because the people I look up to have blocked protocol development to prevent bitcoin from progressing im going to blame bitcoin developers for this instead of the people who block it"
To give you an example of the *gross stupidity* of your logic, you are basically like the DEA saying "We will not reschedule marijuana classification because there is not enough medical academic literature to support that it has medicinal value" while ignoring the fact that by being schedule class 1 its *literally impossible to research it*.
When you want to ask yourself why bitcoin has lost some of its dominance, maybe you should be asking yourself "who has prevented bitcoins protocol development" ....because its the protocol development that allows bitcoin to expand its capabilities.
Increasing the blocksize does not expand capabilities. It merely adds additional resource usage to the network to subsidize users transactional costs by shuffling the debt onto node operators. But it does not enhance bitcoins capabilities in any way shape or form. **Only protocol development can do that**.
So while you sit here and shitpost, you might want to ask yourself who has blocked protocol developement. Because things like TumbleBit, Lightning Network, MAST, Schnorr.....these things have been blocked by your chinese friends and heros like roger ver. 
Thats real cause and effect that has created some of this effect you speak of. But you speak of these facts without grasping what the underlying cause and effect of these varibles are.
Maybe you should actually understand the cause and effect before shitposting about it on reddit.
Also, none of this even gets into why the bitcoin dominance index is bullshit anyways. Anyone can artifically inflate the value of their shitcoin and deflate bitcoins "dominance" by issuing new currencies. Once you understand this then you can start to understand why your position is bullshit without all of my above points.

Im blown away by the fact that this comment is not at the top. My very first response to this entire fiasco was that the user was using SMS 2FA which is highly insecure and likely the culprit here.
- Are you sure that your phone was not compromised? If someone already has your gmail pass, it means they have access to all of your personal information. This makes it incredibly easy to socially engineer their way into your account at your phone company.
Once they can redirect the SMS to a phone they control, its trivial to access your account.
Im very sorry for your loss, but you should never use SMS 2FA to "secure" your accounts.
The best way is having a hardware key FOB 2FA. A device that is offline and cannot be compromised or accessed. That was a lot of money to lose and im very sorry, but its likely your fault and not bittrex.

Every single reply to every comment in every thread you make cherry picks the things you feel ideological opposed to, but ignore all the facts people present.
It's difficult to assume good faith on your end when you *constantly Dodge the hard questions*. I have noticed this on every single thread you participate in which people criticize you. You respond to about 20 to 30% of the questions and you ignore all of the hard ones that catch you in logic traps. 
You will of course respond and say something like "I don't have time to fully respond to every comment". And while we get a glimpse of your viewpoints from the bare-bones responses you do give I think that you might as well just not respond at all if you're not going to give your full intellectual honesty.
For example you have consistently dodged the fact that segwit is a block size upgrade. Yet in this thread multiple times you claim that we have stalled at upgrading the network.
The only thing that seems apparent to me is that you have some sort of obsession for hardforks. I don't know why and I don't know what you're trying to accomplish but the end result will simply be destroying the value of Bitcoin by creating chaos.

While I don't entirely disagree that this is the greater picture, the [quote leaves room for interpretation](


I agree that the context of the quote *likely* meant mining nodes.


Exactly huh? Ok, well lets look at the quote...


Clearly he used the term "one" as in singular. He also uses the word "LAN" clearly implying that this is a networked design, as in over tcp/IP, and **not** at a hardware level. A ASIC mining rig is **one node** in the network. These "1000's of nodes" you are referring to could be other mining rigs with a local 192.168.x.x ip on the LAN, but if you are trying to imply that each ASIC chip ("worker") is *exacty* as satoshi envisioned with that quote you are pulling shit out of your ass and calling it candy.
Maybe I shouldn't have used the term 'p2p' and just left it at 'satoshi was talking about networking'. P2P was the wrong term to use in the context of discussing LAN networking, since thats obviously not a ad-hoc design if there is a router present. Im assuming satoshi assumed there was a router present in the LAN to route the traffic. Either way, this is semantics and has little relevant bearing upon the discussion.

I believe they were responding to a question that had the context of "when will we see a bitcoin environment *built around* LN" in that the LN experience will have been completely matured and adopted.
So the 6-18 months quote is basically when LN will be adopted across the board with most businesses, wallets, platforms, etc.
LN will be available to use on the main network in 2-3 weeks. But thats going to be a alpha release, and then give it a few months to work out bugs/kinks, then perhaps a beta release, and then commercial platforms can start adopting it for day to day usage.
Considering that [blockspace usage is going down as segwit integration is going up]( think we have plenty of time for LN to get adopted.
I think we have easily 18-24 months once we see *all* exchanges and wallet providers adopt SW before we start running into blockspace issues again.

RAM. It is the most expensive commodity with ever increasing UTXO sets. HD space is the *least expensive* commodity in regards to bitcoin.
Also we have a reversal of progress in a lot of 1st world countries where instead of us getting faster more unmetered connections we are instead getting monopolistic entities forcing metered connections upon us, making bandwidth also a concern. We can handle it right now, but it would be poor planning for the future if we did not calibrate these conditions into our blueprint.
My node has sent more than 1TB in the last 45 days. Thats way more than the 300GB caps that seem to be the standard monopolistic enforcement these days.
Moore's law is not providing the gains satoshi thought it would to help counter-balance resource cost usage. We have very little progress in new technology in regards to RAM, HD space or bandwidth that will be both consumer ready and consumer pricing competitive in the next decade.
I've been really excited by Intel Optane for years, but it has [already shown no improvement over nvme]( so thats a major disappointment. What else is there brewing around the corner that will help make up for the halting of moore's law over the past decade? Nothing that will be ready anytime soon.

If this is the case, you should have no problem telling us those innovations.
Im open to hearing what you think are innovations, but I recognize that a lot of the better coins out there that improve fungibility such as Dash, Monero, Zcash all have serious costs associated with their various zk-snarks, Ring Signatures, etc. This will lead to long term consequences in resource cost that ultimately centralizes the coins. And all these coins all suffer from scaling issues.
So what other innovations other than fungibility enhancing coins are there? ETH appears to have a pretty robust development community going on, but what protocol level work is being done? There are always going to be developers on the edge, looking to expand their business use case, but the importance is the protocol layer development. For example, 3 billion shit-ICO's does not improve ETH's protocol layer, it just creates artificial wealth and then redistributes real wealth to those running the scams from those suckers who "invested". That does not improve ETH, I would argue it does the opposite.
So you can understand better, please read this -
What innovations at a protocol layer have you seen in other alt coins?

Is there any issue getting people to do this? Maybe you could find an angel investor (or just a really nice btc evangelist) that is willing to put up the btc for locking in exchange for the block reward when it is found.
I figure they would only need to commit 25-50 btc to get things going right? and provide fresh btc to lock up as more blocks are found and redistributed back to that investor?

You also seem to think, as if we were living in some alternative universe that bitcoiners would of have agreed to hard Fork to fix the Lost or stolen funds from a centralized entity like mt gox.
It's incredibly difficult to take any of your argument seriously when you don't seem to understand the facts the culture or the purpose of Bitcoin.
Try using PayPal or venmo sometime. That seems to be what you are looking for. Please leave us crypto users alone, we don't agree with your perspective.

Yes but in order for this analogy to work there must be repercussions for the expansion. In the case of Bitcoin when you increase the amount of resources that could be utilized by the network you have to remember that there are repercussions on the node operators at the network.
So let's say that that two-lane Highway was along farmsteads and did not affect their property values. But now with this big ass Highway and all this Commerce their property has lost two thirds of it's value due to the noise and pollution. This would be a *little* more accurate, but still lacking.
So yes absolutely increasing the block size would free up some space and reduce tx cost, but there are negative effects for this action. If you are trying to convince me that subsidizing transactional cost by distributing it to the backs of Node operators it's going to be a hard sale. I don't care how much your Bitcoin transaction cost this is highly flexible digital gold in a forever Ledger you should expect it to cost something in order to record it, and you shouldn't expect people who are running nodes to do it for free or that they'll keep on doing it when it starts to become an economic burden.
Without decentralized network security Bitcoin is worthless. Its a great thing that we have responsible stewards of the network who are busy engineering Solutions to scaling that increase transactional capabilities without reducing the fundamental values that make Bitcoin worth what it is.

I can't be the only one in  here that feels this way ....
Im almost 5 years into crypto and I still feel like a newbie. Its a rabbit hole that the more you know, the more you realize you dont know. Like life in general, the sheer amount of data should humble you and make you realize that you have only touched the surface.
Every day reminds me of how little I know about cryptoland, and unless I plan on getting a degree in crytography at a major academia, I dont think I ever will know more than just the surface. What lurks beneath the surface of bitcoin is some amazing crypto magic.
I've tried to understand blind signatures, but frankly the math is too much for me. I still dont get how you can have an input that cannot be traced to the output after its been "blinded" by the mixer.
Little things like this keep me honest and humble.
But all too often people come in here and post with new accounts under 1 year demonstrating sheer ignorance of how bitcoin works. And thats ok, we were all there, but its just the damn stubborn ones who think they know better are annoying AF. Its ok to ask open ended questions, thats how you learn! but dont make authoritative statements. We will be much nicer correcting you if you do the former, and not the latter. 
And remember, bitcoin is a mixture of many highly complex subjects. Theres a bunch of cryptography, a healthy dose of distributed systems topology, combined with peer to peer networking, a emphasis on hardware with ASIC mining + complexity added with more distributed theory and if that wasn't enough we get to throw in socioeconomics into the mix not only with complex financial models but with the psychological aspect of markets and human behaviors playing a large part.
Sometimes I think the last part is the most important, no matter how great the math/crypto is, a project can fail if enough stupid people take over. I am constantly reminded of this in that we here in cryptoland might as well be in the USA for the endless war that constantly exists with hostile takeover attempts over the legacy protocol.

Since you appear to be using words you dont understand, here's the [wikipedia article on appeal to authority](


I think its not controversial to say that the inventor of hashcash, which is the foundation for Proof of Work in Bitcoin, is an authority. Doubly so [since he's actually refrenced in the Bitcoin Whitepaper]( - 


 2002.
Appeal to authority as an argument is a fallacy in which you appeal to people *who are not authorities*. So either get it in your head and use it in the correct context or stfu with your ignorant nonsense. In fact, Adam is one of *only 4* authorities that can actually claim to be an authority on the issue (outside of bitcoin core developers who have proven through hard work to also be experts on the topic)
Since you don't know your history, here are those 4 -
Satoshi Nakamoto
Adam Back ([hashcash](
Wei B ([b-money](
Nick Szabo ([bitgold](


No he did not. He *made a statement* and one that only demonstrates he *doesn't understand how bitcoin works*.


I already demonstrated why his assumption was ignorant. If you don't understand I dont have the time to spell it out for you. If you cannot read my above post and figure it out for yourself then you are too stupid to waste my time.
What you are doing here is trying to advocate anti-intellectualism. You are basically saying "How dare you quote a expert on a complex technical discussion?" ....which is just horrendously fucking stupid.
It never was, is not, nor will *it ever be* wrong to quote an authority on a subject. It always was, is, and always will be wrong to *quote someone who is not an authority* on a complex subject.
These people are an authority for a reason. Because they have built a reputation through meritocracy. They undertstand the system 1000x better than you, I, or any shitposter on reddit does. Quoting them is not only not wrong, its the right thing to do. Now kindly take your fucking ignorant shitposting back to where your conspiracy theory echochamber thrives.

No, the difficulty will fluctuate based on hashpower contributed each period. As it always has. And when it readjusts miners will switch to mine the more profitable chain. What do you think is going to happen to the legacy chain when it first gets that difficulty change and suddenly miners can mine 10 blocks a minute? Its going to be a free-for-all as miners switch back to the legacy chain from S2X. Then S2X chain will drop in difficulty, and miners will switch back to that. This will go on for quite some time.


They already are. Its called Segwit and it allows for LN, Schnorr, MAST, etc.

How do you know your transaction is valid unless you run a node? By trusting centralized parties?
Bitcoin is a *peer to peer* system which disintermediates trusted intermediaries. The entire point is to not rely upon 3rd parties.
People in 3rd world countries need to be able to run nodes to ensure that they are not being defrauded, just like every single service or business needs to run a node to ensure they are not being counterfeited against.
Im not saying *every single person* needs to run a full node, im saying that the barriers to entry cannot possibly get bigger or we will firewall off large swaths of the world from being capable of running and using bitcoin as it was intended as written in the whitepaper.
If Jamal in Nigeria wants to start a bitcoin business he needs to be able to run a node.

It does not claim outright that bitmain has supported bcash, just that because they are such a large well funded entity that they "have the ability to".
Thats a far cry from a smoking gun.
I really wish that employee would give a statement with more certainty. It might just be the fact that English is obviously not his native language, so hopefully, he will provide some clarification. This will be very easy for Bitmain to deflect. I think its quite obvious that it is in fact Bitmain who has supported bcash, but there is only circumstantial evidence.

Obligatory it's too crowded at this restaurant I'm going somewhere else post.
This whole myth that people are leaving Bitcoin to use other things is provably false. All you have to do is look at the public data that's available on the blockchain to see for yourself that this is simply not true.
I think that this could be true if more Merchants adopted other altcoins and allowed people to pay just as easily with those altcoins as they did Bitcoin. But then there's the question of how much it cost to convert your BTC to these all coins and whether or not it's worth it just to pay the price of the transaction fee even in spammy Markets.
There's also the question of how much profit you might lose holding these alternative coins vs. Bitcoin.
When you factor in the premium that you'll pay converting your coins, the risk that you have using centralized entities to do this conversion, and the loss of appreciation in value by converting I think it's pretty clear that even with high fees that holding Bitcoin and using Bitcoin is still the winning solution long-term.
It's also important to recognize that the reason that fees have been up lately is with the Bcash emergency difficulty adjustment algorithm which has economically incentivized miners to switch to bcash during its low difficulty adjustment. Basically mining week's worth of be cash in a few days which win starved results with the Bitcoin hash rate dropping resulting in pretty substantial extra wait times 4 blocks by at least 25%.
I would not be surprised if the spammers are now coordinating their spam attacks with these bcash Eda periods to maximize the effect of their attacks upon the Bitcoin Network.
I think it's pretty clear who is behind the attacks and that is always going to be who can gain the most from these attacks. Miners who can recuperate the cost of these attacks while pursuing publicly acknowledged agenda are the main culculprit. Jihan and BTC.com being the two most vocal.

While this may be technically true, it's very easy for people to confuse a central planning agency ultimately controlled by the government for the government itself. The president of the United States elects the chair of the Federal Reserve which is the United States fiscal Central planning agency.
Satoshi put a incredibly heroic effort into avoiding ideological discussion but there is a undeniable ideological statement that Satoshi made when he created the Genesis block referencing the chancellor on the brink of bailout news article from the UK.
This is the strongest ideological statement that Satoshi ever made and it clearly indicates that Bitcoin is meant to protect against corrupt Central planning agencies from confiscating wealth.
Who are these Central agencies other than wings of the government?
So yes you are absolutely correct that Bitcoin is not anti-government but it is anti Central planning agencies which are ultimately government entities.
I can definitely understand how the average person might confuse the two because I commonly see individuals misconstrue the concept of government.

I see the contradiction from an ethical POV, but not a technical one. Since btc1 now has opt-in replay protection its possible for exchanges to provide wallets on both sides of the fork.
Its most definitely wrong to purposefully cause chaos in the ecosystem to try to gain leverage to force the remainder of the ecosystem to your *invalid consensus rules*. The rest of the network just wants to continue forward without being fucked with. 
Its almost like Jeff and NYA signers are lepers. And instead of accepting the fact that they are lepers, they want to force the rest of the world to be lepers with them. Just leaving us alone isn't good enough for them, so instead they are going to purposefully set out to infect all of us so that we all become lepers.

@_date: 2017-10-23 22:35:20


No, its not. Its a hardfork that is attempting to take over bitcoins network but as a contentious hardfork they will merely split off and become their own alt-coin, except at the expense of bitcoiners since the lack of replay protection will wreak havoc on the network.


First of all, its not called 1x, its called bitcoin. This is slimey propaganda to take something and to try to rename it when you are merely a competitor. Does Fanta get to rename Pepsi "ShitSoda" ? No, of course they don't. 
Secondly, [bitcoin already is and has been massively more profitable]( B2X does not exist. It cannot have value except what value traders speculate on in a futures market. This same futures market accurately predicted BCC within a 5% margin. There is some merit to a retort that a futures market cannot predict the *precise* price of a asset, but it can most definitely demonstrate a markets appetite for that asset within a reasonable range.
Third, miners make more profit when blocksizes are constrained. When there is free space there is no reason to bid higher to get your transaction confirmed. So your own logic is working against your point. A constrained blocksize that is always near the threshhold of current market activity will always reward miners with more profit.
Bitcoin has preformed much better on this. In fact, that was the entire argument against a unbounded blocksize...that it would limit miners profits and merely increase the cost of resources upon node operators.

Jokes aside (and that was a hilarious one), the digital version of cocaine traces on USD would be coins tainted with darknet activity.
I saw research not too long about that 40% of all bitcoin activity has inputs/outputs tied to darknet markets. Over time I think it is nearly impossible for almost *all* btc to have some DNM taint attached to its history.
Only freshly mined btc that are held are probably taint free, as well as casascius coins.
This is why the work of and the contributions of active folks like (hidden wallet) is so important. They are taking academic research and turning it into a reality, increasing fungibility.
There's no reason why my grandma should get accused of being a drug dealer because she bought "tainted" coins.

@_date: 2017-09-07 22:48:14


You have to read into the intent/context. The fact that there are not 5 different "bitcoin"s, with merchant adoption should tell you that none of the attempted splits or takeovers were successful. There is only one bitcoin and no one is disputing that. That is yet to be seen coming in november, but as of right now anyone who says bitcoin has been split is ignoring reality.
The fact that we have all remained on the legacy chain and use it to transact shows that bitcoin has succeeded in defending hostile takeovers. Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited, etc. None of these attempts were successful.
The fact that we have upgraded the system and that we have all stayed on the same chain is proof that the industry reached consensus each time. 
Also, bcash was a seperate project that attempted to steal the name of bitcoin. It was not a proposed change to the system that was initiated by the bitcoin ecosystem. Its like your neighbor walking into your house and just saying "This is my house". You'd be like "the fuck it is joe". And thats exactly what happened.

I keep telling all my friends this. Whatever price depression we are experiencing now will be severely amplified by the S2X HF come november.
We may rebound a little but not before we are smacked with a much more fundamental reason for a price depression.
China banning bitcoin is GOOD for bitcoin. S2X and a contentious hardfork can only create chaos and hurt bitcoin.

That opinion is of course founded in delusion with no basis of facts whatsoever.
Try harder, and do more research. You'll find the truth is bleaker than you expect, though we are trending in the right direction since 2013. And linux/mac infections are surprisingly higher than expected, though more persistent since both lack hardened AV systems that are commonly used, even if they exist. Again, if you account for the amount of undetected persistent rootkits/malware that are currently installed, the % number is *way* higher. But we of course cannot know the unknowable, so we can merely guess. 
Either way, whatever AV companies state as current infection rates we can reasonably assume the actual infection rates to be significantly higher. Unless of course we are prone to delusion and think that AV's catch everything, all the time.

Measuring consensus? Uhm....dude, 95%+ of the network runs bitcoin core. Consensus is measured in clients and installs. And you are referring to a open source network with public peer review. So very secret! 
Its hilarious that you are accusing the developers of a public open source project of the very thing the people you support are doing. Thats why im accusing you of failing logic. You cannot see the tree's for the forest.


Who only represent a small portion of the economic activity of bitcoin. The list of people who have not signed on who represent economic activity is the far majority.


*All* the exchanges, all the pool operators, all the node operators and users. We need ecosystem wide consensus for a HF to be non-contentious.
Im not crazy like luke, I dont think we need 100%. But we do need 85% + of the ecosystem supporting the changes for it to suceed without massive network disruption.

Yes. Do you really think purposefully sabatoging the Bitcoin network is going to "solve the gridlock"? The recent merge for the bio that disguises btc1 nodes demonstrates a Trojan behavior of a repo that clearly does not have consensus.
This will amplify it's problems, partition it's own network and create more chaos.
Do you really think all Bitcoin users are going to abandon literally *every expert* to go with a corporate takeover? There will be a split. No matter how poorly the legacy chain preforms during the coup when difficulty adjusts miners will flock back for their profits. When core keeps releasing all the improvements to the Bitcoin protocol you think people will run inferior products?

Its not as simple as that and there are conditions in which greatly effect the success or failure of an agreement. Im not purposefully trying to disagree with you, I just think you are generalizing and simplifying in a way that is unconstructive to understanding. I've [gone into length on this discussion here]( but for brevity, I'll summarize it....


















This hopefully demonstrates what (I think) is the intention of your post, but adding more qualifiers to the argument. Social consensus absolutely can and is reached in bitcoinland and can move the progress needle foward, as we have seen with every other soft fork in bitcoins history post-satoshi. This becomes more and more difficult the bigger and more fractured we become yes, but is not impossible to achieve.
As you can see, despite all the turmoil, SegWit got activated. Under sketchy conditions and strings attached, but it did get implemented. That was all because of social consensus. It was 100% social consensus that allowed for segwit to get activated, not the nakamoto consensus. The nakamoto consensus actually failed to activate segwit.
Considering this example, the quote "The very concept of Social Agreement outside of Blockchain is meaningless to Bitcoiners." appears to be false. Social agreement got us our recent agreement, and the nakamoto consensus did not (in that it was only able to be achieved *with* a social consensus mechanism because without it it could not).

Nice goal post moving. Okay so now we're not talking about the public, now we're talking about specific individuals at a particular company which are involved in the decision tree-chain making process.
Well that's not exactly a contentious opinion and I would mostly agree with you so long as these technology companies have hired experienced and rational technology officers to help with executive decisions.
So for example you have James Lopp at bitgo who is publicly and openly against his CEO for signing the b2x agreement. You also have  the CTO at bitpay publicly questioning the safety for B2X, asking for a rationale for going forward at this point as there appears to be only costs and no benefits. You have Mandrake at blockchain.info who has been with the team since day one and has answered over 100,000 support tickets, who is against B2X despite his CEO being pro B2X.
Do you see the trend here? Those who are technically competent in engineering are all in consensus against this proposal. And all of those who are involved on the business side and who are not experience in software engineering or technically competent are trying to force changes on the network that helps subsidize their business on the backs of users.
Thanks for burning yourself with that point you made this easy for me.

@_date: 2017-09-09 23:31:14


Very few people want smaller blocks. Most definitely way less than 1%. Maybe the more accurate statement is "most core supporters want 1mb or larger blocks" A lot are happy to keep it where its at for *now*, but if we are looking into the future then most acknowledge we need to raise the blocksize, just only after we measure how much impact SW/LN/Schnorr etc has.
@_date: 2017-09-18 18:25:54


Yes, and people constantly misinterpret this mechanism. From the whitepaper -


**valid blocks** by working on extending them and **rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them**. 
S2X is introducing invalid rules without any reputable consensus building mechanisms. If you are going to say "that is the point of the nakamoto consensus" you might be correct on a technicality, it will determine short term who the winner or loser *appears* to be...but in the end its users switching services that will determine the long term winner. No one is going to win out of a contentious HF. Everyone loses. Its a lose-lose scenario.
Social consensus mechanisms are formed before nakamoto consensus mechanisms. A responsible community will rely upon the first layer of the decision process, a social layer, *before* resorting to the nuclear option - a contentious HF resolved only through nakamoto consensus.
It sounds like you are trying to take eriks stance on this issue, that it is miners who decide the rules. If so, you are just as hopelessly confused as he is.
Economic nodes ultimately determine valid consensus rules by accepting or rejecting blocks. But if these economic nodes reject or accept blocks with rules that the users dont agree with, then the users will no longer use that particular economic nodes business/platform and switch to a platform who's node obeys rules that they hold priority.
Its convoluted, but users will always have the final say. Its just that we will have to face chaos and destruction upon the network to figure out who thinks what.
That is not good for bitcoin.

And what polling or consensus building investigations has coinbase, blockchain.info or bitpay taken to determine what percentage of their *customers* will support their actions? Luke's [poll]( which was done *on coinbase* shows **the exact opposite of what you state**. 
You are still under the disillusion of thinking there's 95% mining support, even after the F2Pool announcement? At *most* its 85%, but thats 85% of *pool operators* making a political statement on behalf of their users. There is 0 guarantee that the users will stick with the pool once S2X wreaks chaos on the entire ecosystem. That is also completely ignoring the fact that *miners do not decide the software that users run*. They can (like bcash) mine their invalid blocks and create their shitcoin all they want, but that wont make it bitcoin. It will just make it another wannabe bitcoin shitcoin that has the backing of conglomerates/central authorities....the very thing bitcoin was created and designed to bypass! There's not an ounce of bitcoiner left in your veins if you think CEO's can force changes upon the bitcoin ecosystem. You are as pathetic as your buddy Roger.
Businesses mean nothing when the users wont support them or their actions. You know this, don't pretend that businesses get to dictate the rules when they don't. Users do. You know damn well if you make a change to shapeshift your customers wont like they will jump ship faster than you can say "disloyal" to evercoin.com


Breathtaking cognitive dissonance considering only [23% of businesses support S2X]( Under what alternative reality in which white means black and water isn't wet do you think that is a majority? Are you seriously ignoring all the major exchanges that did not sign onto the NY agreement? How do you possibly cope with the facts going against your position?
And why the fuck hasn't your site implemented SW yet when its the economically rational thing to do? Instead you are charging outrageous default static fee's when there has been an all time low in fee rates, with the majority of transactions being in the 1-30 sat/byte range.

No, they don't. Read -


Then it shouldn't have been activated. Them getting a few mob bosses in a room to agree to get it activated only if they can recklessly hardfork the network to the destruction of bitcoin's value in confidence is not an agreement that they can make for the entire community. We did not agree to this agreement. 


Only to someone not educated on how Bitcoin works. Users are the ones who spend Bitcoin, e.g. they're the ones that create market value. As we have seen extensively miners follow the profit. Users determine the profitability based on their spending habits. 
As you can see on [bitfinexs B2X futures market]( B2X is worth less than 25% of one BTC right now. Not good for B2X.
Also I don't think that you're educated on the history of the mechanisms that were utilized to upgrade the Bitcoin protocol. Satoshi invented the soft fork and used a flag date activation threshold to upgrade the system. Later Rusty Russell proposed and we implemented a BIP9, which Rusty has publicly admitted was a mistake of his. It turned miners into Political vehicles for ideological positions in which they can veto changes to the Bitcoin Network. 
He has also publicly stated that it will not be utilized anymore and we won't make that same mistake again.
It's easy for someone like yourself to get too confused on how this all works not knowing the history of how the system was previously upgraded and the changes to upgrade mechanisms (bip9)that introduced only in late 2015 and implemented/used in 2016. In life you have to experiment to get results and sometimes those results don't end up going the way that you intended. So you learn from those mistakes my correcting them and doing them the right way in the future.
BIP8 appears to be the right way and that will be the mechanism that will be used to upgrade Bitcoin in the future.
So your assertion that miners control Bitcoin mainly comes from not understanding how Bitcoin works both via its protocol mechanisms and Via Market mechanisms not understanding the social consensus layer of Bitcoin and not understanding the history of Bitcoin.

While KISS is a great concept, unfortunately you cannot always use it. If possible, of course its best to simplify. This is standard procedure for optimizations.
You are engaging in bike shedding here. You cannot trivialize such an enormously complex system. This is not your private LAN html server. This is a global decentralized network that is a first of its kind, utilizing multiple pieces of large scale technologies as backbones to integrate into one system to attempt to create consensus on a global network.
If you think its simple, then you are being intellectually dishonest. Or, you are ignorant and don't understand the complexity of the system. 
If you want, you can screenshot your PhD in cryptography and I will accept your opinion that it is "simple", because the **only** people bitcoin is "simple" too are *experts* who have spent their lives creating and refining these systems. There are only a few people who could claim such credit, Nick Szabo, W. Dai, Adam Back, and maybe a few other cypherpunks.

First, tax rates are *not* crazy high, and I have no idea how/why you would respond firstly with that when my OP clearly demonstrated that tax rates in the US are historically **low**.
Secondly, those countries who do have "high" taxes, also have more proportionally distributed benefits, such as national healthcare systems, free universities, etc.
The problem is that America *could* provide all of these benefits to its people, but we have a parasitic federal government that spends in the tune of trillions more than we receive with *most* of that funding going towards military, when we already outspend every other nation 10:1 as it stands.

The context of the reference was in regards to getting SegWit activated. For you to say it "didn't hold true" considering *segwit got activated* is provably false.
Obviously, social consensus worked or we wouldn't be using segwit right now. Obviously the nakamoto consensus wasn't working to get segwit activated because ....*it didn't*. Not until we collaborated on a social platform to reach an agreement did nakamoto consensus finally get segwit pushed through.

You sound like someone who drank the koolaid but doesn't understand the words he speaks.
It's not "hackish", it's "flexible". Real power users and developers will understand, aka the people who matter. For example, a lot of times when I need to accomplish some task I use a Linux shell. Because it's more powerful. Using raw transactions is more powerful as you have more options that way.
Serious companies with competent devs use raw txs. Rookies with low competence do not. Just like this no SW spreads light on the real intent of these companies, it also sheds light on incompetence, aka shapeshift.

Improving, managing and theorizing Bitcoin is not what you learn in C++ 101 courses. Nor can you. It takes many years of  industry experience working with distributed systems + a solid background in cryptography/mathematics to meaningfully contribute to the bitcoin project.
Thats not to say there are not smaller things that entry level programmers can contribute to. Its just that those contributions are not *significant*.
The context of this discussion is Garzik taking back control of the repo over a power complex. Jeff is way over his head and even someone as experienced as Garzik, decades of contributing to the linux project, even **he** is incompetent enough to make trivial mistakes that would entirely break bitcoin.
He couldn't even change a single parameter without getting it wrong. 
We are to expect that rookies with little coding experience and *no experience in cryptography or distributed systems* are going to somehow be able to meaningfully and significantly contribute or improve bitcoin the system or protocol?
I get it, its open source, anyone can contribute. But that doesn't mean their code will get merged.

@_date: 2017-10-10 03:32:18


No, he did not. Adam Back invented it and it's called hashcash. That's why Satoshi referenced Adam Back in the white paper. It was his work/invention.


By measuring client versions. Clients who have upgraded are compatible with changes introduced in that version. A flag day can be set far in advance to give people time to upgrade. Thats exactly what Satoshi said.

(See how annoying that is? Don't be annoying.)
Now that you've proven your point, I would like to admit that you were correct and I was wrong on one point. Clearly the doubling of transistors has not led to an increase of performance as I previously expected. The chart you provided however does prove the Slowdown of Hardware performance even though it does prove that the doubleing of transistors has continued to be sustained in accordance with Moore's Law.
Most importantly what has not increased is the rate in which multi cores are developed and implemented to the consumer Market. The chart you provided clearly shows it falling flat since 2009, and with heat being the major problem transistor size is no longer a relevant metric when it comes to Performance gains. And that I was clearly wrong and I'm thankful for your debate on the topic although my advice still stands that you should just respond with the data instead of the angsty Teenage Drama. My original Point has been solidified thanks to your response. This is why I debate so aggressively and why when people tell me to relax I take it personally. Debate is what helps us evolve change and learn and I love it when I'm proven wrong because then my arguments become stronger. 
As I suspected the common interpretation of Moore's Law, plainly speaking that the performance gains of Hardware doubles every 18 to 24 months, has fallen flat since the release of the Bitcoin whitepaper. And as I also thought we will see Moore's Law come to fruition with this common interpretation but only in leaps in major advances of Technology through the decades and not as a linear performance gain as we saw from 1965 to 2000.
These leaps a performance gains will not help Bitcoin scale. Bitcoin is a ever-increasing resource hog on a linear chart that needs linear performance upgrades to keep consumer Hardware cost down while resource usage is going up. Leaps won't help that except far in the future. Well I am concerned about the future I'm more concerned about the immediate future and how we are going to plan for these resource costs.

I have asked Eric a dozen times in the last month why he and other CEOs have not contributed more to the social consensus-building processes when they have platforms that are capable of reaching millions of users in a Sybil resistant way.
He has consistently cherry-picked my comments, responded to the ones that he can respond in an ideological fashion expressing his opinions on philosophy but never once has he responded to the basic question of why have they not done this while all claiming that they have consensus even though they've not attempted to measure it when they have all the capability to do so.

This is the company that blocked segwit in the first place to preserve its patent on cheating proof of work to increase its Revenue in a uncompetitive and monopolistic fashion.
There was a good statistical analysis of blocks Mined by antpool since the introduction of the Asicboost in covert form and there was a clear correlation between antpool mining empty or near empty blocks right after this technology was created which increased over time. I understand that correlation is not causation but can anyone else come up with a rational reason why the moment this technology was introduced suddenly the behavior that indicates this technology was being utilized is suddenly more apparent?

Also remember that Satoshi said we could host thousands of nodes on a LAN with a single facing WAN node too as a "solution" to scaling.
Obviously Satoshi wasn't a god. He had things wrong. Fortunately, he had almost everything else right, including placing the 1mb limit to protect against spam.
Your logic is foul. It's basically "this is how it was, so this is now how it should be." While ignoring the *massive* changes over the last 9 years. 
I want you to think of it like a two-lane Highway. Two lane highways are great in most places in the United States. Everyone in the town thinks oh yeah that's the good old 79 and I take my tractor on it everyday to get to work. They're all super stoked for the two-lane Highway and the efficiency that it brings to them in their everyday lives.
But then Costco comes in and builds a super store in the middle of their town. And then a bunch of Indians come in and build casinos and suddenly the town with a population of 20,000 now becomes 2 million.
Do you think that that two-lane highway is going to be sufficient? 
No of course not because when more people start using a thing that thing needs to evolve to become better at what that thing needs to provide otherwise people will just complain about that thing being shitty.

He has an economic incentive to use SW. He shouldn't need altruism in order to do what is economically rational.


I didn't say to stop supporting legacy transactions. You're making assumptions. Im talking about the opt-in feature that we were so graciously granted (segwit) that allows for discounts on transactions. 
With his service being a blockchain hog, using valuable and often expensive resources, it only makes sense that he take advantage of batching his withdrawals as SW-supported transaction types to take advantage of said discount.
I would sincerely disagree that he's paying "market rate". Judging by what he is charging his customers as a default for each transaction it appears he is overcharging in the area of 50-100x right now.
Thats sloppy and stupid.

Splits are very bad. But there are silver linings, for example it allows some of the toxicity to escape and partition itself off into its own little community.

ETH prices typically correlated with BTC except that it tends to lose a higher percentage when BTC drops and gain a higher percentage when BTC Rises. Specifically meaning that it's volatility seems to be higher. I have noticed in a few incidences in which it did not appear correlated and it moved in a mirrored fashion.
Do you really want to risk your Holdings on something that might drop in value more than the item you're selling? You would also be denying yourself tokens on both sides of the split which as we have seen in all splits so far the combined value of the token plus the split token ends up equating to a higher value than the token was equal to prior to the split.

I, and most bitcoiners, disagree. Corrupting the system to centralized entities is much worse long term. This is a classic preserving short term profits at the expensive of long term security argument. You are arguing from a point of draconian authority.


This is the power of social consensus and why systems must remain decentralized. A benevolent dictator (vitalik) became a non-benevolent dictator the moment he decided to put his personal wealth ahead of the security of the system.
Those who are in central control of a system can be compromised, either externally or internally from moralistic of capitalistic (as in this case) perspectives.
Vitalik was compromised the moment he lost money in the ordeal and decided to use his central authority to lobby for changes.
the social consensus layer comes before the nakamoto consensus layer and this is why its so dangerous to have central control in any system.
The more decentralized the various infrastructures (developers, users, miners) the more resistant it is to corruption, as is clearly the case with the ETH hardfork.

Have a wonderful day and good luck to your learning and Bitcoin. I've been at it daily for about 4 years now and the more I learn the more I realize that I don't know very much about Bitcoin. The biggest revelation to me about Bitcoin is that even know it's this incredible system that is built of so many different pieces of Technology working together in harmony, it is still a system built and controlled by human beings and therefore susceptible to flaws of our psyche. It just happens to be much more resilient against this than other systems due to the various mechanisms but the susceptibility is still there and it's going to be challenged very hard over the next few months so we're all really excited to see how well it will do!

Well, we cannot have it both ways. Either we want bitcoin to be a niche platform that appeals to the inner libertarian/crypto-anarchists, or we want the moon, which means your grandma talking cryptoshit on snapchat.
So if we are to accept the facts, then we must accept that the *majority* of people who have come here came here for the lambo's. I don't agree with these people, but I don't have to agree with them, bitcoin is all inclusive and permissionless. Their beliefs do not interfere with my ability to use bitcoin, and the more bitcoin they buy the more bitcoin is worth so there is a net positive benefit.
I guess if you are a overly sensitive childman, you might get super butt hurt that people don't think and feel the way you do, but if you want to be a mature adult, you'll recognize they can think and feel however they want and it doesn't effect your life unless you allow it to.
So either we have nazi moderators that enforce highly ideological stances, or we respect everyones voice so long as they follow some basic community guidelines.
If we do the latter, then there will be tons of shitposts about price, meme's and all the other crap that is normal across reddit.

Yes, this is the best response to the red herring has presented.
He assumes that *signaling* is the same as *mining* despite all the evidence to the contrary. Miners follow profit and with B2X at a little over 1/10th the value of BTC it's difficult to rationalize to a sane person that these Miners will lose money regardless of any social promise.
Miners are under no legal duress to mine B2X, which will be made very apparent soon enough.
All this fork is going to do is create chaos, depress the price and distribute power to the enemies of Bitcoin short term. Long term Bitcoin will be fine and rebuffing this attack will strengthen confidence, but only until after the dust has settled.

So when someone tries to send their BTC on blockchain.info after the fork, and they send both their BTC and their S2X coin's, losing one of them forever, that was their choice?
You are creating a non-sequitur. You are saying "opt-in replay protection gives full sovereignty" while ignoring the fact that you are part of signatories that are going to force that decision on the entire network, and force those users on your fork into a choice.
You know very well that the majority of bitcoiners are non-technical and will not understand the ramifications of their actions. They are going to wish to use bitcoin as they always have, and suddenly they will have accidentally lost a portion of their holdings because the company who's services they have been using over the last few years suddenly decided "Im going to be on this side of the fence".
Im sorry but the conclusion does not match the premise. You are claiming something that is factually just not true, all while pretending it is.


It would not just make it "easier", it would allow for a *real market mechanism* to determine the winner instead of forced market mechanism. For someone with such strong libertarian ideology as yourself, I have a hard time comprehending how you think its ok to eliminate the free market decision of this process and conjecture that it still exists. If you truly believe in market mechanisms, then you will not attempt to force users to use S2X. 


Thats doublespeak for "force users onto S2X" and if you think through it you should have no problem accepting that. I know that the cognitive dissonance here is dizzying, but your words do not mean what you think they mean.

You must stop with anti-intellectualism. You must listen to those experts who are *most qualified* to make these statements. Are you seriously ignoring the advice of Nick Szabo and Adam Back, the two people Satoshi based his work on? How can you possibly deal with that fact in your mind?

Do you think people are just going to lap up your lies? Now there is no doubt. You are not a good faith actor. When you have to constantly lie to prove your point then it is reasonable to assume you are a bad faith actor.


Who do you think created SegWit, a blocksize increase? Why do you constantly ignore this fact? Its almost as if it does not sit well within your worldview, so you just push the fact outside your consciousness when typing these thoughts out. 


Ok. Now this is mind blowing. You are a signatory of a group of executives trying to impose non-valid rules through industry force, and you really have the audacity to make such a statement?
You are not a good faith actor in bitcoin world. You are clearly so entrenched in your own gospel that you cannot recognize your *extreme congnitive dissonance*.

Yes, that is precisely what will happen. Just as like with BCH and their EDA. I did not imply that this will not happen, this is one of the more nasty side effects of the S2X hostile fork. It destroys bitcoins POW security mechanism by splitting the asset groups which miners can game.

I agree. I've always been in favor of bitcoin core releasing a updated roadmap that includes a hardfork to implement things from the hardfork wish list.


Im not sure how to respond to this. I think you are really confused on how bitcoin works or why we need replay protection. We need replay protection very specifically because not everyone will be using the fork.
Do you not realize that the majority of the industry is running bitcoin core software? That means the majority of the ecosystem would have to voluntarily upgrade their software in order to be on the new fork.
So without replay protection, the portion of the industry that decides to upgrade will be broadcasting their transactions on their fork on the legacy chain as well. How is the market supposed to work if the market cannot determine which fork is which?

You are welcome to like Bitcoin for whatever reason you like but that does not mean you get to decide what Bitcoin "is about" for others. Show me in the Bitcoin whitepaper where Bitcoin is about "anarchy"
If you cannot accurately vouch for this, then you really need to adjust your opinion and stop trying to make unfounded claims. Satoshi has *never* espoused the concept of anarchy. He wanted to reduce state control of bad monetary policy and that is the most you can ever say. I'm open to being convinced otherwise but I've read every single Satoshi post in existence and I am confident my position is accurate.

Huh? Is the RU really saying that because issuance is decentralized that it might be illegal to purchase? I can't think of any laws that would make that so. Sounds like unnecessary fear mongering.


Saying that there's no security in Bitcoin which currently has more than a hundred times hash power of all of the global super computer networks combined is a patently false statement. We currently are at above [10 million Terahashes per  second]( I suspect what they're trying to say is that since there is no central control that there can only be a limited regulation and therefore preventing scams in the space is more difficult.
This is a complicated net benefit trade-off. In order for this(Bitcoin) to have power it must have sovereignty. The exact thing that makes Bitcoin valuable is the state's inability to confiscate and manipulate its monetary Control process. So yes this does mean that individual investors will be more directly on the hook as their government cannot save them from their bad decisions but it also means a drastic increase of personal Liberty and financial sovereignty to Citizens around the world. But people should be on the hook for their bad decisions. Businesses shouldn't be too big to fail and should suffer the consequences of bad investment choices. This obsession with saving toxic investors through public subsidy is pure poison on society.
Just stop and think for a second that one Satoshi, 0.00000001 of a Bitcoin is now equivalent to 1 Venezuelan Bolivar. The people of that country have watched their wealth disappear to hyperinflation. 80% of money was confiscated or deemed illegal by the Indian government over the course of 3 days. If Venezuelans help Bitcoin instead of their local currency and just converted to the Bolivia are when they needed to buy Goods they would have thousands of times more money than they do now....as some bitcoiners in Venezuela do!
These are things that are atrocious violations of citizens financial sovereignty via government control and bitcoin eliminates the effectiveness of this behavior.

shitposting on reddit is pretty addictive judging from the amount of garbage here.
But on the real, I saw a interesting study that something as simple as perspective can greatly increase the possibility for success in quitting. For example, instead of saying "Im never going to smoke again" they found that people who instead said "I dont need it now, maybe later" had much greater success rates.
Something about the way the human mind works.
I never got too deep in smoking, but I found when I stopped smoking that smoking weed greatly reduced cravings. I know that may seem like a 1:1 trade to some people, but weed is much less toxic than cigarettes and a much healthier alternative. Just dont roll blunts and smoke 2 grams every time and you'll come out improved. Then once you are no longer physically dependent upon nicotine, you can kick the non-addictive weed habit.

Says redditor of 3 days to someone who has years of experience posting specifically in this sub demonstrating a reasonably in depth understanding of the Bitcoin system.
utxo growth is a cause for concern, specifically the way the issue is compounded without an economic realignment that does not punish users for spending dust.
You are engaged in a false dichotomy here. There is depth to this topic and you are scratching the surface and claiming deep knowledge. 
Growth is a good thing, but more importantly is *how you plan for the growth". Bitcoin right now is like a bus with 10 seats and no room for luggage, but with big hollow walls with no utility. Bitcoin + Segwit is 20 seats with the walls hollowed out to fit luggage. Schnorr is like having a no luggage limit for a flat fee, allowing customers to bring on 1 or 1000 pieces of luggage for the same cost.
Right now we have people saying "let's add 10 more seats" while ignoring everyone's luggage. But the luggage has to go somewhere, and the more people using these buses the more we get luggage pileups.

Those are some pretty large claims. The hashpower we know pre fork but how can we know post fork? But the fact that you and Roger are not taking the bets to trade 1:1 your BTC for S2X is certainly indicative that S2X will be worth much less, otherwise why would you not take the deal?
And as for users what data do you have to back up such a claim? I have asked you this numerous times and numerous times you have ignored this point. You have a platform in which you can conduct polling with a large amount of users. You can take account age and history and you could put together a poll that while is not sybill resistant can at least provide us some data on the issue. Why have you not done this? Why have you not asked other service providers to also provide these polls? There are companies like bitpay and coinbase who because of kyc laws would be perfect candidates for building consensus on what users actually want that is Sybil resistant.
To date the only Sybil resistant poll done on coinbase shows the exact opposite of what you claim.And that was open source and transparent, unlike S2X. Don't bother with polls unless you are willing to be open and show the data. We don't trust these non transparent actions of yours.
Frankly it sounds like instead of building consensus you want to just lie to people and deceive them and then to try to force them onto a chain of your preference. The fact that you have not engaged in any consensus-building processes demonstrates your dishonesty and bad faith actions on the subject.
I wholly support people taking legal action to prevent fraud in a regulated Marketplace. Trying to use industry deception to change the rules without user support absolutely is fraud. Matt's letter was to a regulatory entity whose job it is is to ensure that an ETF is regulated with public benefit in mind. Are you really criticizing him for trying to protect people from abusing power within the marketplace? There's no such thing as a free Market ETF, so the rules might as well be fair.
You can of course clear this up at any time by showing us the proof that you have consensus across the board........ But I think me and you both know that you don't have that.
If you truly believe in the free market then you will add replay protection and you will let the market duke it out. Because right now using industry Executives to force a real change is not the free market. Deceiving people in lying to them claiming that you have consensus when you have no proof and no way to support such a claim is not the free market., and definitely not how you do bitcoin.
I think it's quite obvious why you and other signatories have not conducted Research into consensus on these issues. It's obvious that you won't have the consensus that you need to Fork safely and that you know it's a non-starter.
Either provide proof of consensus or stop lying about the facts. As we have seen hashpower is not consensus. It will follow profit. Since you don't know what users choose you don't know which chain will be worth more. Without that knowledge you cannot claim which fork will win, so you don't know where hashpower will stay. It really is that simple.

The Legacy chain will confirm blocks slower until the difficulty readjusts. It's possible that that may take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months but once it does readjust the miners will flock back to it since the difficulty will be so low that they will be able to turn out blocks like Mad Men and profitability will be extremely high.
You have to look at it from a long-term vision point of view. Bitcoin core has all of the real cryptographers futurist experts excetera, they will be the one creating all of the Cutting Edge technology that will make Bitcoin valuable. It will be definitely some short term chaos and will mean a likely substantial hit to the value of Bitcoin in general and a loss of confidence but long-term I see the Legacy chain as surviving this even no matter how many industry Executives get in a room and put their signature on a piece of paper.
Remember that Bitcoin was designed to disintermediate intermediaries. A large portion of the economic activity in the Bitcoin industry is through intermediaries who have built their business upon the backbone of the Bitcoin Network.
Bitcoin is designed as a peer-to-peer Network in which people can transact value with other people without intermediaries.
Allowing intermediaries to designate what Bitcoin is when its whole purpose is to eliminate these types of businesses...... Well you can see how ridiculous that is.

I don't think that Erik deserves any amount of respect. I think that Erik is a business person who has capitalized off of the opportunities Bitcoin has created. Why should we respect people just because they've made money off the Bitcoin ecosystem?
With atomic chain swaps coming on Lightning Network shapeshift is going to be a dinosaur soon. We should recognize that this is an old business model and that Erik is prone to old-school thinking in Bitcoin land.
No amount of libertarian ideological posting can erase the damage that Erik is doing right now by advocating for a contentious hard fork with no reply protection.

Clearly some major players in the industry have pledged to follow it. Not the majority, but enough to cause chaos in the ecosystem, especially with a majority of miners willing to mine it which will result in delays on the legacy chain until a difficulty adjustment.


I think you misunderstand what replay protection is. Its not about losing a coin, its about being able to choose which side of the chain you wish to transact on without having your transaction broadcasted on both chains.
You dont want your transaction "replayed" across both chains, hence replay protection.
This allows for *true* market discovery, instead of a monopoly attempting to coerce the industry to follow their footsteps through brute force.

How then are we supposed to measure consensus?
For the segwit 2x supporters their biggest arguing point for the last several months has been that they have consensus because they have 95% of the hash power on their side. 
Considering their token is now trading at 1/10th of 1 BTC, I don't think that any person with a normally functioning brain could try to rationally claim that the miners would mine at such an extraordinary loss.
We saw with the Bitcoin cash Fork that the bitfinex futures Market accurately predicted post Fork price. So we do have some historical accuracy reasonably contending that the bitfinex Futures market price of a token will correlate with post fork pricing.
Bitcoin is a capital based system. It works because interested parties have economic incentives to behave an economically rational ways. Measuring market value therefore is a logical way of predicting the behavior of Market participants which includes miners.
While I do think that it would provide a more accurate estimation of market value if we had more Futures markets I think that there is a reasonable margin of error that exist on bitfinex. The reason that the margin of error is Slim is because bitfinex does not have barriers to entry. Anyone can sign up easily on bitfinex send their tokens and trade. If there were more complex regulatory barriers that I think that we could reasonably expect there to be a wider margin of error. 
Futures markets are absolutely essential in determining consensus for a future token that is attempting to Fork the network.
I see no demagoguery in explaining how Bitcoin works. Ironically I think demagoguery is a tactic that the segwit2x camp supporters constantly use in order to try to rationalize their irrational position. They rarely use science or facts to justify their positions and most often used appeal to Emotion by dictating ideological positions. "Blockstream Core this" "AXA that".
If you are not in their camp then why are you arguing from their irrational position?

I dont disagree with anything you've said here.


Well, thats the thing about decentralized systems. Its a system of tradeoffs. We realize a net benefit from the decentralized properties but trade off the efficiencies of centralized control.
In order for us to realize the benefits of achieving non-nakamoto consensus pre-fork we would have to trade off some of the trustlessness short term. We actually already do some of this.
For example, right now, nothing is stopping coinbase, bitpay, blockchain.info, gemini, etc from implementing sybil resistant polling. These are entities that have a cryptographic means of verifying users wishes correlated with their economic activity. That is the basis for luke-jr's coinbase poll. You are trading some amount of trustlessness for some assurance on the way peoples opinions stand.
The same could be said with Bitfinex's futures market right now. Even though its capital based, its still *centralized* and we are giving up trustlessness in order to satisfy a question to which we wish to know an answer. The futures market right now is providing us with *very important* information, and its outside the bitcoin system. Its existant upon a centralized server in the control of people we dont know, and really people we *dont want* to trust. These are just bankers 2.0
Yet, there you have it...the information is incredibly valuable and we need these mechanisms to help determine consensus **pre-fork**, and its coming from a non-bitcoin protocol and centralized source.
I think that there is a philosophical discussion to be had about democracy, mob rule vs meritocracy based systems, *when it comes to non-nakamoto consensus pre-fork*. We still have to evaluate changes, decide whether we wish to implement them and this is still subject to human psychology, sociological and socioeconomical factors.
Its possible that future bitcoin transaction formats could have the ability to "vote" on particular BIPs, expressing preference for changes and having that preference weighted by your economic activity. But then this leads us to a problem...how do we prevent people from replay attacking the problem and endlessly trading back and forth to fraudulently declare more support for an issue?
Well, then we come right back to the issue of decentralized vs centralized trust. If we want some sort of accuracy to pre-nakamoto consensus then we must rely upon a central party who is legally bound to KYC to do polling to gauge individual preference.
Ultimately, I agree that the nakamoto consensus has a final say in the matter, and that is the beauty of bitcoin. Its just frustrating to have people make the naive assumption that because a majority hashpower claims preference on a issue before the issue has happened that it means that hashpower will continue to support that issue post-fork. 
Ultimately the hashpower will, in majority, follow the market. If the market determines an asset to be of lower value, then its reasonable to assume the majority hashpower wont follow it. I respect the fact that there are irrational players within a market and we will see a minority follow ideologically driven choices, even when it is economically irrational. But these people will be a minority as most people will care more about the money, again, the beauty of the nakamoto consensus.
But my problem with our discussion is you seem to be ignoring the process that occurs pre nakamoto-consensus. You ham fist the discussion implying that nakamoto consensus is all that matters, when clearly it is not. It is merely a *final determining* mechanism in the event that society cannot come together and agree on the path forward. But we often do come together and agree on a path forward without the need for nakamoto consensus, and this process is incredibly important to understand.
Because this process can be hijacked. All of bitcoinland can be influenced by malicious actors on the social stage. We are watching this happen *right now* with S2X. Nakamoto consensus is no where close to being used yet we have (previously) 95% of the hashpower saying "we will do this". Those actions have severe impacts upon others choices on how they will act.
So we shouldn't engage in black and white thinking, and just say "nakamoto consensus is all that matters", because clearly its not. Theres an enormous stage that exists prior to that process and it has global impacts. Nakamoto consensus is just one brilliant piece of the puzzle, but we cannot ignore the sociological implications bitcoin has pre-nakamoto consensus.

These are all really fantastic game theory questions that explores the question of "what is fundamental value".
I think another way to approach this is to try to make your professor understand that Bitcoin is not comparable to a stock. It is not comparable to a company. It's more comparable to a network (Facebook, Google) but even that is only getting a small portion of it right.
OPs question was a good one because it opens the gates for discussion on exactly what type of asset class it is. And the truth is that it's a completely new type of asset class that combines the value of a large Global decentralized Network then combines it with a currency and then creates a endless network of value where there are an infinite use cases of how to utilize that value. Whether it's land/identity registry, provable voting systems, smart contracts, settlement systems for banks, IOT bridges for micropayments, etc, Bitcoin is a very abstract thing for someone so entrenched in traditional economics to understand because it encompasses literally millions of use cases within its system.
Getting him to understand these use cases could start to get him to understand what the underlying value is.

Yes, saying something costs 40 sat/byte when it does not is a lie. Fortunately the blockchain is transparent so we can see this and we don't need to speculate on it. 90%+ of txs have been falling in the 1-10 sat/byte range so it's a blantant lie to say it costs 400% of what the actual cost is.
Just because a small percentage of people vastly over pay for something does not mean that the price of that service or commodity is the price that those people are paying. 
It's not wrong for a business to profit off of services but you are confusing an actual service with something that is a public service. The blockchain is a inclusive public platform that anyone is welcome to use and trying to pretend that you're offering an additional service and charging more for it is not acceptable.
Offering a spread on the price point or charging a flat fee for services rendered is totally appropriate. 
Basically you're advocating that you should be in double jeopardy. You're saying that it's totally normal to pay for a service and then when you're trying to exit the service that you get charged again. This would be like paying a toll booth both on the way in and on the way out.
I don't know why any rational consumer would advocate for something that hurts consumers but that's what you're doing. It's almost as if you are a bit pay apologist and you're protecting them for some personally motivated reason.

Your assumption that by amazon enabling bitcoin purchases that it would suddenly need to be able to handle 10% of amazons peak transaction time is entirely unrealistic.
The last time we heard some data, it was 1% of purchases were in bitcoin on overstock. Now I think we can both agree that overstock is a fly compared to amazon's volume.
So 1% of overstock is like 0.001% (if not less) of amazon's volume.
Growth for business follows a linear scale. Adoption of new technologies *can* follow a S-Curve (Internet, Fax, Smartphones, etc), and bitcoin is surely on that path, but do not confuse the adoption of bitcoin and its value on the path to a S-Curve and then try to claim that amazon will also experience a S-Curve in bitcoin purchases. Thats not how it works, at least not short term.
We have *years* before people will be using bitcoin in the volumes you estimate, and in those years we will have a robust well developed LN that will be handling sub-satoshi microtransactions. Right now we have irresponsible businesses that think they can force changes on the network to subsidize their business model. As bitcoin has forced banks to pivot their business model and adapt, so will bitcoin force bitcoin companies to pivot and adapt. If not, we will pivot around them and choose the smartest economical path. It takes time for societies to learn in mass, but we will surely do so. The dinosaurs will eventually die.
In regards to nodes, yes, if we were reckless and stupid enough to try to scale on-chain it would cause a massive resource shift that would eliminate large swaths of independent node operators, reduce decentralization, trustlessness and security. Fortunately we have responsible stewards of the network who are trying to scale bitcoin in a responsible way that will retain its security model, and therefore its fundamental value propositions such as fungibility, censorship-resistance, etc.
Your fears are unfounded.
Edit - Words.
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:16:46


Because Bitcoin core is a responsible set of stewards for the Repository. They will not do anything that unnecessarily risks damaging Bitcoin regardless of how politically-motivated some people may be.
Segwit2x has literally not a single technical shred of evidence supporting its necessity. Engineers cannot approve of engineering an unnecessary upgrade that needlessly risk the health of the network.
The largest threat to bitcoin is has and will always be a 51% attack. When centralized entities become too large they can collude to try to create an environment that is beneficial to there business or ideologies. Segwit2x is a good demonstration of this where a bunch of CEOs and Executives of companies got together and colluded with minors to try to attempt to force invalid consensus rules upon the rest of the network.
If Bitcoin cannot survive this then Bitcoin was not designed well enough to prevent a corporate takeover of its infrastructure. The coin will survive this and the Legacy chain will survive. It's going to be a turbulent process and it may take months but when difficulty adjusts miners will flock back and long term we will point back and laugh at this as we laughed at Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin unlimited and Bitcoin classic.
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:20:31
I sure hope that by "stable state" they mean *multiple* difficultly adjustments on **both** sides of the fork. We cannot know what miners will do until we know what the profit ratio is after difficulty adjustments. 
Since they follow the money this could potentially mean a short term (2-8 weeks) period where one chain may have a much higher hashrate, ensuring 2-3 week difficulty adjustments where the other chain might take 6-8 weeks to adjust. But once it does adjust, if it's retained more than 25% of it's value, then miners are all going to flock to it for better profits since difficulty will be so low.
 But this scenario would create a chain with a larger difficulty for a short period of time. Is coinbase going to try claim the winner then?
I sure hope coinbase does the honest thing instead of lying in attempt to call the results early to strong arm support for their side. Seriously, we all know coinbase is a big blocker Armstrong has a many year history of supporting shitty takeover attempts. 
Fuck coinbase.
@_date: 2017-10-06 22:36:22


Yes, I understand what you are saying but that scenario is under normal 51% attack scenarios. I think the current situation of collusion is outside that scenario, or at the least there are extra ramifications to consider.


Unless the "other players" are economic nodes (bitpay, coinbase,etc) that instead of rejecting it, accept it, and then allow users on their network to transmit value based on those accepted blocks.
I think its pretty clear at this point that no matter what happens, we will end up with 2 separate chains. A portion of the economy will support S2X, and the remainder will support legacy or legacy+S2X.
There will be stagnation on the legacy chain as hashpower drops, for several weeks to several months. Many will stile mine it for the same reasons we saw miners mine ETC. The difficulty will eventually readjust, and then we will enter a new era of legacy chain + S2X mining oscillations in which the security of bitcoin will be greatly weakened.

It should be noted Blockstream is not a part of LN, but they do contribute code in the open source model, just like Blockstream developers commit code to the bitcoin repo. No one is forced to run the code, nor are pull requests merged without public consensus debates on the mailing list (ACK/NACK).

This topic is difficult to find balance on. At the same time that I want to promote academia I also recognize that a lot of formally educated economists are so dogmatic in their ways that they cannot see clearly in this new space.
The most obvious example is Krugman. World renown economist.....sure, but also a complete failure when it comes to understanding and predicting the impact of Bitcoin.
Economists are rarely technologist's.
This gives them huge blind spots when it comes to cryptocurrencies, so I often find it difficult to see their perspective.

No. You are trying to apply a general theory to a specific scenario while ignoring the context. Please dont engage in a false dichotomy in order to attack my position.
The context is not that the 1+ million lines of code were the value itself, but that they were evidence of protocol/network/system improvements which were written.
No, its not just because of the time they put into it that makes it valuable. Its the fundamental benefits that these improvements allow for the system that creates the value. Anyone can write bullshit code and claim they've done work. In fact, im sure this is what a lot of IT contractors do. I don't claim that these people created value. I will claim that Bitcoin Core, in engineering new tech that resolves old problems, destroys barriers and increases utility  *absolutely provides empirical evidence of them engaging in improvements to the system*. Remember the context of the discussion, go back and see original OP's quote if you need to stay on track.

@_date: 2017-10-07 15:35:28
There are two forms of consensus. The first, social consensus, is a majority decision. The second type, which is utilized in Bitcoin is referred to as Nakamoto consensus which is a reference to the proof of work mechanism in which minors determine the longest valid chain.
Both forms of consensus play a critical process in the decision-making mechanism of users Developers miners businesses excetera.
The Nakamoto consensus is attempting to override the social consensus mechanism in the case of segwit2x and it's a interesting experiment that will ultimately determine who matters more in Bitcoinland.

A bear market has grounded some humility into me these past 2 years :)
Also, reading ....*a lot*....has helped me come to grasp with some realities and dispelling some illusions.
It is still my general thought that while bitcoin will aide the government in its tracking and regulation efforts, society will still be able to evade through crypto-obscurification. We are at the beginning stages of products like Dark Wallet which will greatly aide the privacy aspects of bitcoin. 
I see a future with regulations and safeguards in place, but a network the operates on the fringe that allows society the freedom we need in order to act within our privacies rights, though often in defiance of the laws. We already have this, with TOR/i2p and mixers, and things will only get more regulated and more obscured.
Technology is always a cat and mouse game. There is always a balance, and the balance teeters one way and then another. One method is nullified, and then solutions are found. Right now the ball is in our favor, as this industry is still the wild wild west in that there is not much scrutiny yet, at least not comparable to the traditional financial sector.

Again another strawman. It doesn't increase the attack Surface by 4X. It does not increase the attack surface at all. That was the entire point of segwit is that by moving the signatures to a different part of the container we would be able to increase the transactional capacity without opening up the network to quadric attacks.
This has been posted since 2015. If you really have been active here for 3 years then you should have read this once or twice the first few thousand times it was posted.
It is **only** with Segwit2x that this attack is made worse and that is because it wants to increase the legacy blocksize.


Is this lukesCoin or Bitcoin? Bitcoin....? Ok. Then why don't you stop crying about what one single dude out of *literally hundreds* of bitcoim core developers said? Luke is often not representative of Community opinions. Also you take his comment out of context. He is both literally and technically correct when he says it is a 4MB Block size increase but there is context involved in which I go into below.
Again this has to do with you not understanding the technical parameters of Bitcoin and then shitposting about it. Segwit is not merely a doubling of capacity. Luke's most recent analysis actually shows the potential for 2.2mb based on current transactional mix.
As schnorr is implemented and multisig use goes up we will see that number increased towards 3 megabyte and possibly further Beyond. This is the problem with people who don't understand bitcoin they don't realize that there are stepping stones and the things we do today are what enable the real increases of tomorrow. Instead we have to get into the trenches dumb ourselves down and fight ideological Wars because you don't get it.
So, in short, both you and this other guy are wrong on most of your points and you are trying to argue from a perspective of ignorance.


The only thing that is dumb here are the people who are getting more dumb by reading your misinformation. As I already said please stop shitposting here go back to rbtc where other misinformed people like yourself can get up voted in a Echo chamber of gross stupidity.

OK. I don't think you are getting it. You are claiming that because 3rd party centralized entities are claiming you require a high fee that its somehow bitcoin core's fault?
The bitcoin network does not require a high fee. There are 30 thousand transactions already confirmed today with a 1-10 sat/byte fee.
If you want to complain, then complain to coincap.io, complain to jaxx, 21 co, complain to whatever wallet provider that is inaccurately forecasting cost.
You seem to want to play the blame game when you dont even understand how this all works. Do some homework, then check your perspective.
For the last 2 months we've been getting sub 10 sat/byte transactions confirmed. Just because central entities can't get their shit together doesn't mean you get to erect strawmen and create false dilemmas.

Governments will still regulate laws of businesses within their borders and that means transparency in regards to monies paid for work. Bitcoin does not change the reporting requirements you have as a business owner within a state.
What bitcoin does do is make it so that its easier to hide non-reported income, which as we know is usually not taxed anyways (unless its found out). Bitcoin both makes it easier and harder for governments because of the current state of ledger and technology its possible to determine assets of an individual transacting with bitcoin. So governments will be able to hire individuals like Garzik to trace the flow of bitcoin and determine how much tax they owe based on assets they are hiding.
Fortunately the Bitcoin Core developers are a cypherpunk roots oriented crew that are incredibly privacy minded and wish to ensure that bitcoin has the highest amount of privacy/fungibility possible.

BCH split Aug 1st. In the week up to the BCH split the bitcoin futures market predicted a BCH token value of 420-450 range. BTC was in the 2700 range in the 10 days leading up to the August 1st BCH fork.
420-450 divided by 2700 = 15-16%
A BCH token was worth about 0.15 BTC. Right now S2X is worth 0.20 BTC.
Does the S2X crowd really think the extra 0.05 BTC is going to ensure success where BCH clearly failed? [Take a look at the BCH chart over the last 2 months, does this inspire confidence?](
S2X does not have the EDA that allows BCH to be gamed by mining so quickly. Which means that S2X wont be able to be propped up by a faulty algorithm that is designed to artificially inflate hashpower/value.
If this is an example of the "consensus" talks about in his posts, im interested in understanding the cognitive dissonance being engaged in here.
What is his position now that the market has showed his hand? Will he now give up on his free market principals to further entrench himself in big blocker and rabid hardfork ideology?
How many more sound money positions must these "thought leaders" of S2X have to give up in order to rationalize their irrational position?

I believe I am correct in saying that this does not affect 0 sat/byte transactions being broadcasted or accepted, it just changes the way miners auto-select transactions based on historical age. I think this is just a PR cleanup to avoid confusion on any perceived "promises" of "free transactions" being capable of bitcoin core. I also think this is a more balanced market approach that gives precedent to fee's with higher feerate vs some pre-determined "coin age" confounding algo.

Your response only applies to commercial office machines and not consumer grade hardware. If you look up the specs on a high end consumer MFP you will see these units do not store images. The feature set allows for scanning to network locations, cloud, etc but never internal.
Here is a thread on how support forums asking about upgrading the internal memory on a currently sold mid to high end HP MFP....
As you can see, it only has a non upgradeable 256mb nand + 256 dram. The nand holds the printers firmware and would never be used for document storage. The 256mb dram would certainly cache images for printing, as that's how printers work....but it's cached in dram making it volitile storage subject to power, i.e. pull the plug and let the power drain and bye bye cache.
Until proven otherwise it absolutely is a conspiracy theory that your home printers store data permanently. If not a power off, a factory reset will fully clear cache.

And you are an uneducated dunning-kruger pontificating about things you can barely grasp.
Do you not understand how bitcoin's security mechanism works? It works through [Proof-of-Work]( which is a system that burns electricity to prove work completed, analogous to the labor that people must put into physically extracting gold. You can think of PoW in bitcoin almost as a "Proof of Joules spent".
Since electricity is an [energy commodity]( I think its rather ignorant to claim bitcoin has "literally no grounding in a real world commodity".
What gives bitcoin value is its fundamental properties. Just like the fundamental properties of gold, bitcoin too has fundamental properties in which we assign value to.
Those properties include -
Censorship Resistance, Scarcity, Durability, Portability, Fungibility (fraud prevention mechanism) and security (PoW/ Proof of Joules).
The fraud prevention mechanism, security, censorship resistance fungibility values are all inherently linked to Bitcoin's security mechanism, PoW. Without this decentralized security mechanism bitcoin is worthless. It would be trivial to attack to the network and change rules and inflate supply, etc.


This seems like an argument of which the sole purpose is to muddy the water and provide no substance to the debate. All money of all types is all inherently assigned value because we "pretend" it has value. Have you not taken econ101? This is a basic fact that most people out of highschool learn about our monetary system. Its a faith-based system.
I forget the name/details of this story, but it was about a gold vault on an island which suffered a sink hole below the vault. Everyone relied upon believing that their money was backed by gold and that the gold was secure in the vault. After the sinkhole, nothing changed because it was kept secret and society continued to operate as it was because of the faith people had the gold was there.
What is FIAT other than printed paper backed by no real world commodity? Yet the majority of the world operates on this monetary policy. 


Then why do we have literally thousands of cryptocurrencies all retaining value? Your opinion is not backed by any real world data. There is good/sound money, and then there is not sound money. Just because most of these altcoins are not sound money does not mean they wont retain value. 


You are the one advising people to "jump ship" the moment there is a "bug". I've already provided proof that there have been massive bugs before and those people who jumped ship have all lost *massive* profits due to their panic selling. You are giving bad advice based on historical precedent. 


I hope this post illustrates how unfounded your positions are and how uneducated on the facts you really are. You are in no position to be telling people anything in regards to bitcoin. You are a newborn here in and you are attempting to talk quantum physics with us?

Social media movements are incredibly powerful. How can we organize construct an execute Grassroots movement without actually planning them?
Reddit serves as a essential hotbed for the social aspect of the free market. It's beyond valuable for end users to be able to communicate their thoughts and feelings on the business practices of companies in the space.
Asking people to not bring awareness to serious issues and to not discuss them and share their feelings on Reddit is 100% censorship of free speech.
I holy reject your notion that we should not hold businesses accountable on social media. 
We should absolutely continue to share our thoughts and feelings on the corrupt actions of businesses who are behaving irresponsibly immorally or unethically within the crypto space. If those thoughts and feelings involve us saying that we think other people should not use that business then we should allow those thoughts and feelings to be expressed and let other people be the judge of how they want to behave.
What you're basically doing is saying that we are all fucking idiots and that we cannot think for ourselves and make determinations as to what businesses should or should not be utilized based on the information available presented in the subreddit.
I reject such willful ignorance and I will continue to applaud those who speak out against businesses were behaving against consumer interest.
Also, how naive is it of you to think that these businesses are not using Reddit to serve their interest? So we are going to disarm ourselves and embrace their propaganda campaigns and pretend like nothing is happening?
The discussion of these businesses on this social media platform is a counter-balancing-act for consumers to protect against the $$$ that businesses spend in propaganda campaigns. It is vital to a fair society, and encouraging others to not embrace this concept (let alone rejecting it like you are) would be a dis-service to consumers, which in this case is every single bitcoin user here!

I agree with most of your post but this particular point is simply not true and as cryptocurrencies become more common place this is a discussion that needs to happen.
Taxes are something a lot of citizens, especially those in the EU, see as a benefit to society and themselves. I understand Bitcoin has libertarian roots but it is much bigger than a single philosophy and has the potential to impact all of society.
Bitcoin is Sovereign Money. The point of Bitcoin is disabling the states ability to confiscate your wealth either directly or via monetary controls. This means that the states ability to collect taxes are hindered. Some will see this as a good thing and others as a bad thing. I personally think it's a mix of both there is some benefit to reducing taxes and then there is some downside as well. 
We all want bureaucracies to slim their spending and to ensure that it is only done in ways that enhance public benefit such as Social Services like fireman police sewage Education Health Etc. Not being able to confiscate wealth will most certainly have an impact on the bigger picture and will reduce overall capital. Not being able to print wealth is also another complicated net benefit to society.
The good news is that employers can still hold a portion of your salary as payment to your government, people can still individually choose to directly pay their debts to their States during tax season Etc. As long as Society continues to operate the way that it does now in terms of collecting Revenue we probably shouldn't have a problem but we still need to have a discussion on the cost-benefit relationship of changes.

Looking at the page I see ...


This is what bothered me when I watched the video. Now that I read this site to find that there are **12** witnesses and it claims to be "decentralized" ?
Decentralized like...what...[the 12 federal reserve banks](
Claiming something that has 12 "master" nodes is "decentralized" is ludicrous. No one claims the federal reserve is "decentralized" and you would be just as crazy to claim that byteball is decentralized.
If that thing starts to accumulate value, how hard do you think it will be for only 12 people to get compromised? Even ripple, with its 55 "validator nodes" is way too a small a number for it to be secure.
I get that there is a discussion to be had on the tradeoffs of centralized vs decentralized networks. Obviously federated models like ripple, peercoin, NEM, iota, bytecoin and any else have positive attributes of having less friction and therefore being able to transfer information more cheaply, but the downside is that these systems are not immutable. Any claims that a system with a limited number of nodes is not immutable only represents someone who has no understanding of IT security.
If im going to buy into a blockhainless crypto, its probably going to be based on [phantom]( Everything else so far has way too many unknowns and limitations. At least phantom seeks to solve these problems, though obviously non-existant as a crypto at this point.

The fact this is the most upvoted comment is pretty sad. [I count 50 thousand transactions in the 1-10 sat/byte range confirmed today]( Considering that level of activity in the 1-10 sat/byte range, its clear that a lot of those transactions are clearing in a few blocks. 21 co's algo to estimate block clearance rate is notoriously bad and even though it says at least 4 blocks right there are daily bulk transactions in that fee/byte range confirm in 1 block.
So this post is a red herring. Its purpose is to distract from the reality that we are in to push a specific narrative. This is a form of goal post moving *because the big blockers are losing the battle to reality*.
It used to be "We need big blocks because fee's are high". Well, fee's have not been high for months, so how do they cope with the new reality? By moving the goal post of course. Do you see that *one* transaction for 4 sat/byte? Yea! It totally took *hours* to confirm on the worlds most ultra secure public ledger! I cannot believe my coffee took so long bruh.
Despite this change of reality, I still constantly see big blockers pushing the big block narrative on the basis that fee's are high, despite months of a low-fee environment.
This should demonstrate the constant intellectual dishonesty of the B2X/BCH proponents. It should demonstrate that no matter how much you fix the problems they will simply move the goal post, find something new and nag at you incessantly about it.
Yes, it took a while to confirm. Thats to be expected for a 4 sat/byte transaction. If it would have been 10 sat/byte it probably would have cleared in 10-30 minutes max. 
Bitcoin is not free. The system is not free, the resources are not free, the peoples time and labor put into it are not free. Not miners, not developers, not node operators or businesses. Even you, simple bitcoin user, are expending your time/labor into learning this technology, and we all place a value upon our time. So stop expecting free lunch Dorian.
Yes, you might have to pay *a few more cents* to get your transaction confirmed in a ultra-secure global public forever-ledger. I know, cry me a river, right?
Remember, these issues will be solved with LN. Yes, it will take time to bootstrap LN as it took time to bootstrap bitcoin. But once its operational, we will have subsatoshi transactions and essentially free transations (fractions of a penny).
These detractors want to stir up FUD to prevent you from focusing on the bright future bitcoin has and the fact all these other shitcoin fork attempts are technically incompetent.

What backlog? I see 80k transactions confirmed in the 1-10 sat/byte range today and *zero* backlog.
We've experienced the cheapest transactions in 2 years over the last 2 months. So you need to decide why you want bigger blocks. At first it was because you want cheaper fees.
Now you have cheaper fee's. So what was the *real* reason you wanted bigger blocks since now that you have cheaper fee's your still clamouring to get them?
Also, if people were *really* serious about getting cheaper fee's, they would enable segwit right now since it offers cheaper transactions. Since they are not adopting it either they dont think fee's need to be cheaper, or they are purposefully stonewalling the upgrade for political reasons.

Current evercoin conversion -
1 btc($4197.36) to 14.20553818 ETH, @ current price of $292.47 equals $4154.69. Thats a difference of $42.67, which divided by $4197.36 = 0.0101%
How much is a typical exchange fee percentage wise on polo, bittrex, kraken, etc?
Either way, I don't see 1% as being horrible for a 'no frills' exchanger. Pretty convenient. 
shapeshift is offering 14.11471896 ETH vs evercoins 14.20553818 for a difference of 0.09081922 which is a extra $26.56 USD on evercoins side.

Again with the crying. Dude, its hilarious you accuse me of acting like a 5 year old when all you do is play the victim card. No one is attacking you. Questioning the extent of your expertise on something is not an attack. Get over yourself and your ego. No one gives two fucks whether you wrote some code once. You are not a contributor to the bitcoin protocol in any meaningful way. If you claim the opposite, please show me your github contributions to the bitcoin repository. I'll take back my comments if it is deemed that you have sufficiently contributed in a meaningful way that could demonstrate that *you are an **expert** in bitcoin*.
Otherwise please stop with the crying. Its not constructive, all you do is muddy the conversation by constantly playing like you are a victim here. Seriously, get over yourself.

Think of how much money all the resources he used. Nigh near 50 federal agents swarming the scene? 30 plus vehicles? Forensics, swat, the judicial process.....
All of these things must tally up to a pretty phenomenal amount of money that this agent was convinced would be covered once they could *steal* the money from Wagner.

And how exactly is math going to prove the legitimacy or accuracy of information in this context?
Lets say that this morning Russia launches 300 rockets aimed at california, starts world war III. Russia claims the launch was a per-emptive defense maneuver as its just learned of a coup against the country and a assassin had just tried to take putin's life the prior evening.
How is math, or storing the data on the blockchain going to improve the *accuracy* of the data over history? I get the time stamping bit, that provides proof of existence of a said document at a specific time, but proof of existence does not add any *accuracy*.
Think of wikileaks. Think of snowden and theguardian. Did they need the blockchain to provide accurate highly sensitive information? No, they only needed to be a reputable source. The blockchain is not inherently reputable, it is merely a database. Even if you put something in the blockchain, the data needs to be verified before it can be proven to be factually true. 
In this example we would have a unlimited amount of websites all publishing reports, media outlets, etc from all around the world recording the statements from various governments, actions taken, times that actions were taken, etc.
How would inputting that data into the blockchain be any different than the data existing outside the blockchain, and how would that data prove to be *more accurate*? I keep stressing accuracy because the supposed benefit of blockchain based historical recording would be having data that is not *manipulable*....but what is to stop people from putting data that is *not factually correct* into the blockchain as a counter opinion to the 'facts' ? 


We already have the most frequent, transparent and precise data storage available as it is now: Totally and completely decentralized, spread across webservers that exist in the entire globe.  Storing data in the blockchain on the other hand would be a *central* storage mechanism, despite the inherent nature of the blockchain being decentralized. You see, choosing one place to store information, regardless of how that information is spread out, still makes the storage of information centralized, as you are choosing to specifically store it there and not other places. Wikipedia for example is a centralized storage database, even though it rides on a decentralized backbone, aka 'the internets'.
Having a proof of time for when events occured means nothing to the factual accuracy of the events, only the *time* that it occured. You see where I am constantly leading with this? The type of storage mechanism does not alter the validation process of the data. The burden of proof still exists no matter how you store data, and having a time stamp does not change the fact that the burden of proof must still exist, the data must still be able to be *independently verifiable* as would anything else using *the scientific method*.
Using the blockchain does not instantly make everything that goes into it true, and the data must still be able to be independently verifiable in order for it to be taken as 'the truth'.


And how hard would it be for me to construct fake evidence and insert it into the blockchain? How hard would it be for the DEA, FBI, CIA, interpool, MI5, etc ? They would just as easily be able to create counter intelligence to contradict your 'facts' that you wish to order into the blockchain, creating the same false trails, the same misleading intentions, the same casting of doubt onto your 'facts'.
The *only* thing that has plausible usage with regards to information being stored in the blockchain is simply a proof of existence timestamp. That "X" occured on or before "Y" as we know it existed in the blockchain at "Y". But that does NOT mean that the information is *true*, or that the event occured at a specific time, only *before* "Y"
Since this keeps on coming up as a 'big picture' idea, I think its a good time for discussion on the topic whether its even a 'big idea' or not. Recently James D'Angelo proposed the same idea on his youtube channel, see his most recent video [A million killer apps part 2] ( , I've put the URL to the exact part where he talks about using the blockchain as a historical data record.
- thoughts on this James? I know you covered using the blockchain as a record keeper in your video, but I believe some of the opinions I've posted here go outside the video and is good information to debate. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:16:10
Yes that is correct you do have your right to your *opinion*. But when your opinion diverges from the truth and you try to make claims that are factually misrepresentative then it not only is the right of others to call you out but an obligation.
Seriously, what are you 10 years old? The fact that you would even try to defend yourself demonstrates how immature you are. A real grown-up accepts when they are wrong, corrects the information and moves on with life as a improved person.
But you? You just want to petulantly defend your right to spew misinformation. Only a very young child or someone completely disconnected from reality would behave the way that you are.

If transferwise uses a matching system in order to incur cost savings, then this really is a no brainer to me.
Align, using the blockchain, can remit *any amount, any time*, and does not rely upon matching in order to provide maximized savings.
Its like trying to compare a network protocol to the network. Transferwise is only capable of handling payments that meet their criteria, their protocol. Anything outside their protocol they can do nothing with, which isolates them from being a major market player. This does not mean that they cannot have their niche market and offer cost savings benefits to a sector. Just that they are out of the bigger picture if they cannot do it all.
Bitcoin on the other hand is the entire payment network, and does not need to match anything.

No, not at all. I think that rootstock should be judged by its actions, not by who expresses monied interests. I think the whole AXA blorgstream stuff is the exact fanaticism that you are expressing against. We are in agreeance there.


OK. So, I see what you are saying, but you couldn't have expressed all of this in one or two sentences. When you start out with "Lately there's been a lot of "hate this/boycott that" company on r/bitcoin." and then state encouragement against it, it seems that you are trying to restrict speech or the free movement of peoples behavior on a social media platform.
I agree with you in that we should encourage people to make their own decisions instead of jumping the bandwagon. BUT, when businesses behave unethically we absolutely should encourage people to jump on that bandwagon! Thats how social media/grassroots movements are born. We should not try to restrict this.

But to address 's question ....
They are taking us to a future where bitcoin is able to serve *billions* of people. That cannot happen on-chain in a decentralized network, no matter how much opium one smokes before posting about satoshi's vision.
Your harddrive has Cache. So do most of your applications and operating systems. This is the known way to scale/improve networks/applications that are limited by hardware bottlenecks. 
Bitcoin too, will have a cache and it is called Lighting Network. It fixes the node incentivization issue while allowing for the network to scale to the demands of the world. It will allow for atomic cross chain swaps, creating decentralized exchanges so that people can trade assets without relying upon central authorities to manage custodianship of your assets.
The future is a network that is not reliant upon central agencies and cannot be attacked by nation states, or at least not effectively long-term.

It's exactly the opposite. How many people have realized losses because "China ban Bitcoin" and "omg Bitcoin dead", then panic sold for emotional reasons?
The real winners are the HODLERS. 


It was never high risk to those of us who understand the technology. Also, there are mechanisms in place to allow Bitcoin to deal with bugs.
One time a dude magically created 92 million BTC.
All bugs will provide is buying opportunity. While fool's like yourself panic sell.
EDIT - I get some people might take my high risk comment out of context. Important to the context was "those of us who understand the technology". To me, as in the way I view it *from a personal perspective*, is that there is incredibly high value within the bitcoin network and its not nearly as a high-risk investment *to me* than it is to others who do not understand it.
If you do not understand something you should **not** be investing money into it. But the more you understand about bitcoin, the more you realize its much less risky of an investment as we once thought it was. You can go through my history (difficult, I know), and you can find me stating directly without misinterpretation that bitcoin "is a high risk investment". 
But my position has evolved over the years. Bitcoin is no longer that crazy outer-world investment it once was. Is it still high risk? *Maybe*. I think its a relevant question that has enormous context. But as time goes on, it appears the risk is reducing. The system continues to show incredible resilience to external attacks of all types and billion dollar hedge funds are now entering the fray. National banks are investigating bitcoin as world reserve currencies and banks around the world are looking into the technology to decrease disintermediation. I would say all in all the future is extremely bright for *bitcoin*. Yes, not some crap coin you all think is somehow going to magically replace bitcoin, but bitcoin itself.

You mean they might have to actually *own* the money they *wish to spend* .........smh, what a world!
This just means there will be more lenders with a higher competitive fee market. Of course, our wealth will be much greater and more evenly distributed, so we will be better equipped to handle these costs.
Also, I think using the mortgage lending industry as a example is poor. We do call the great recession the "sub prime mortgage disaster" more often then we call it the great recession. If any area needs less spending its that one.
I believe that no matter the change, the system will adapt. Solutions will be found for these caveat's. Great change takes great elasticity. Im not going to be the one best suited to answer your questions, though I'll give it my best :)

[Without the Bitcoin Core developers improvements Bitcoin wouldn't even be functional today]( so when the same developers that optimized the system/network/protocol so much over the last 5 years also say "We should not do this" then I have a rational basis to listen to their expertise on the subject.
Yes, thanks to Bitcoin Core developers the network actually *could* handle a small blocksize increase today. Whether or not that is wise however is an opinion that the developers all have reached consensus on that is not a wise choice.


Whats the context here? Are you trying to call "base" blocksize increases "scaling" ? If so, thats a pittance. A small blocksize increase gives us almost *zero* scaling when you look at the long term goals of the TPS rates needed to be achieved. Other technologies, like segwit, Schnorr, MAST + LN + 2nd layer caching networks however *will* bring us a TPS that can compete with VISA.
All engineering choices have tradeoffs. And the engineers have long been on the record that there are more intelligent ways to engineer these tradeoffs that cause a net benefit to the network. 
Yet we have a industry cabal of non-technical CEO's attempting to force non-technical changes upon the network all to subsidize their business costs on the backs of users.

Moore's law has had little to no influence since bitcoin came into existence. We've seen no where near the projected increase of bandwidth, cpu speed, memory increase or hard drive storage increase that moore's law predicts.
This was one of satoshi's biggest mistakes. He's written many times that he expected moores law to account for the ballooning of resource costs. Except....that didn't happen.
And we still have shitposters claiming that moore's law is the bandaid hail mary solution against centralization, despite having zero evidence to back up their claims.
The next "big thing" that will be a game changer is intels optane RAM/HD hybrid, but we are a decade away from that getting competitive with consumer prices for SSDs. So it has little effect upon moores law. And atomic HD's are decades away.
And even optane [shows no increased preformance gains over nvme]( so im not sure it will even have the effect we thought it would! There's almost nothing else around the corner thats going to be a "major" breakthrough ready for consumer products in the next decade with manufacturing now slowing to a near halt in regards to moores law.
And bitcoin nodes *absolutely must* be capable of running on cheap consumer hardware.

You must not understand the definition of "mainstream". To me, mainstream has a negative connotation. It means the shit that most people accept because they are too lazy to search for alternatives. Its whatever is most popular, most easy for them to digest. Mainstream simply means above a threshhold in popularity to be accepted by masses.

If "As it gets" implies that youtube is a contributor of mainstream media, then I would think that "As it gets" implies *not* being mainstream media.
Youtube is a content hoster, not a news outlet. The content uploaded to the site may then be used on a news outlet, but you have the cart before the horse in your thinking.
The only reason its "the most viewed on youtube" is because RT decides to use youtube as its host. The views come from RT subscribers, not from the fact that people "go to youtube for the news"

Yes but in your rationalization you are simplifying it too much. It's not that Bitcoin and S2X cannot both survive, they definitely both can. The problem is that *if* S2X with the hard Fork then Bitcoin Security will be greatly lessened due to fluctuating hashrate. This is of course horrific for Bitcoins security and will lead to exactly as you described in that there will be oscillating hash power switching back and forth between both chains depending on profitability.
There is of course always the possibility that the market will decide one coin is worth substantially more than another in which case you will see an ideological faction continue to mine the Lesser value chain while the majority mines the more profitable chain as would be economically rational. A good example of this happening is ethereum classic.
So it's possible that S2X or the Legacy chain will remain say 15 or 20% of the hash power which is not enough to oscillate over to conduct a 51% attack on the majority chain. We will know more in the following weeks as bitfinexs Futures Market matures and we start to see valuation firm up.

Yes, but I think it goes a lot further than that. Businesses do not unilaterally get to decide what is Bitcoin. Misappropriation of customer funds is just one vehicle of this behavior. Signing letters, backroom deals with no transparency to force rule changes upon the network without Consensus building mechanisms is a much more insidious form of this behavior. Miners do not decide what Bitcoin is, they just order and timestamp *for profit*, and how/where/when they timestamp changes as the wind blows.
So this group, miners, can never be trusted to dictate *what Bitcoin will be* because there is no mechanism forcing them to mine one chain over another, other than profit.
So unless someone has a crystal ball that sees into the future, we have no way of knowing where the wind will blow. 
If we are to do this without consensus building mechanisms, then replay protection must be added so the market can *fairly* determine the winner. The S2X signatories are all claiming victory without evidence or even the possibility of evidence existing because they have not bothered to measure consensus in *any way at all*.
These are the same individuals at companies that espouse free market principle, all while trying to suffocate free market mechanisms.
Ask and , Stephen Pair, and Brian Armstrong how many Sybil resistant polls they have conducted with their userbase to determine what *their customers actually want*.....
None. Not a single attempt. They are risking a 70 billion dollar Network *on an assumption*. How insane is this? These are companies with hundreds of millions of dollars with investment capital and they cannot even conduct a single poll on what their uses want?
Put that into perspective. These are the people you want deciding on behalf of all users? It's way more outrageous than any other coup attempt before this. At least Gavin tried to build consensus. But these people ? They just lie to you. Say they "have consensus" while ignoring how Bitcoin mining works.
It's almost as if....*gasp*....these CEOs don't understand how Bitcoin works. It's not a giant leap of logic to realize these people are fool's when you recognize that there is 100% consensus from all Bitcoin *experts* on this issue. The people who truly understand Bitcoin are united against this madness. That's a pretty freaking huge fact to overlook when considering splitting the network....because a few CEOs got into a room to agree on a rule change ...*so that we wouldn't split the network*.
The lack of logic in all of this is astounding. Literally cognitive dissonance in real time.
@_date: 2017-10-22 14:16:55
It means that users are upgrading their nodes with a reasonable adoption rate. Decentralized networks are tricky because they require many working parts to work as a whole system. When you introduce new features or optimizations it can take time for these to go into effect since nodes are the validators of rules and one backbone of the system.
Don't listen to people who say nodes don't matter. They are very ignorant to the way Bitcoin works and would like you to believe that centralized sevicers are a better option. If we wanted central based networks we would use PayPal of course. But Bitcoin is about financial sovereignty from governments and corporations manipulating monetary controls, and you cannot resist these large actors without a robust globally decentralized network.
These same ignorant people will put forth conspiracy theories of a cypherpunk owned company (blockstream) some how corrupting developers to do their evil bidding. This is of course likely brought on by drug induced paranoid delusions since cypherpunks are the antithesis of state or corporate control.
The best way I can put it is Blockstream is like the progressive SuperPAC called WolfPAC. They exist in a space normally reserved for corporate profiteering, but their ultimate purpose is to reduce corporate profiteering for the benefit of society, as these behaviors are in perfect alignment with cypherpunk ideology.
But some people have very small minds and cannot think through the complexity of this situation. They assume because they took investments by large groups that they are somehow under a legal obligation to do their corporate bidding. This is of course not true, which is why Blockstream has made it public that the contract details with the couple developers they pay have a clause that puts open source Bitcoin development first, and should they (or a future owner) attempt to force them to go against these bitcoin first principals, they get a years salary in advance. It's possible I have that number wrong, tough to remember details. Could also be 6 months or 18 months salary but you get the point.
Blockstream has two for profit products, liquid and elements. These products are the technology Blockstream hopes will return value on investment for their shareholders. Liquid is a cross platform settlement system used for enterprise solutions. Think of a buyer on coinbase buying into a sell order on bitfinex. Liquid makes this possible.
Yet, Lightning Network and atomic cross chain swaps will make this same model possible in a trustless decentralized way. Blockstream contributes to Lightning Network. If this company is such a big evil corporation why are they putting public benefit first by developing a open source public project that limits the need for their enterprise solution?
Don't listen to the noise, focus on the bigger picture and invest your time into understanding the people who contribute to Bitcoin. These are some really radically principled dudes with some cool background stories. Blockstream owner Adam Back is cited by Satoshi in the white paper for hashcash, which is a form of proof of work that bitcoins system is based on. Nick Szabo as well for his bitgold paper. These experts are publicly vocal about corporate takeover attempts by charlatans under the guise of liberating users from their evil open source contributions (lol). They also both postulate that no one has come up with a good way to scale Bitcoin on-chain without enormous cost tradeoffs, and favor 2nd layer scaling through networks like Lightning. They say this because they are engineers who understand how these distributed systems work and are not charlatans who pretend they understand and yet espouse ignorant things like "full nodes don't matter".

Sure, if you are an idiot who cannot think through the process with logic. 
First, if BTC loses 50% of it's hashrate that means the other chain will be confirming just as slow. So logic failure 
Second miners follow profit,  so mining at 1/10th of the profit ain't gonna happen. This will leave Legacy Bitcoin with the majority of the hash power and S2X with a minority leading too much slower confirmations on their chain.
Third these businesses represent transactions that are initiated by users. All Sybil resistant polling data we've seen combined with all Market mechanisms shows that users do not value this coin. How was this coin going to retain value if users refuse to transact with it?
Users make up the business not the opposite. If the business decides to stick its foot and its mouth I say stupid shit and piss off the users than the users won't use the business anymore. There are literally a million examples of this happening it's a society.
All I can say is just wait for the smoke to settle and you'll see.

Alex Petrov is the [CIO of Bitfury]( When your CIO/CTO is making public statements about the technical unsoundness of a proposal, its time to listen, not to spew ideological talk and inform the CTO of one of the most respected manufacturers in the bitcoin world that he is "wasting his time".
Honestly why is bitfury still a signer of the NYA? It seems clear they are against it. Does pride and ego really matter more than the health of the network?
Just got reading that entire thread. Wow, the amount of cognitive dissonance there is breathtaking. Garzik seems to be living in an alternative fantasy if he thinks he can force a hardfork without replay protection on the network with B2X token trading at 10-15% the value of BTC.
How will exchanges split coins without replay protection? How will they deal with all of the legal ramifications?
What a clusterfuck B2X has become.

Yes, gox happened. I understand this. And the point was that regardless of what happens, no amount of regulation can prevent digital theft. The regulation is not a cybersecurity regulation, its a regulation of AML/KYC laws, things that are applicable to identification and financial laws that force compliance to ensure lack of money laundering, etc.
It has nothing to do with preventing theft. They *say* it does, but they are empty words *because none of their laws prevent theft*.

First of all, you are presuming that there are no costs associated with BCH and that its a purely beneficial relationship. Thats absolutely not true and perpetuating this false line of thinking is destructive towards the long term health of bitcoin.
BCH has poisoned the well by introducing a emergency mining algorithm that is causing oscillations in mining power switching back and forth between chains weakening the security in bitcoin. That does not even address the fact that the more market share you take away from bitcoin and give to a wannabie alt coin pretending to be bitcoin has a economical long term impact on bitcoins price and adoption. It also creates confusion for people like yourself, who clearly seem new to bitcoin.
BCH at the least was a proper hard fork with replay protection through a new transaction format so that transactions would not be replayed across both chains.
What Segwit2X is doing is going to cause massive chaos in the ecosystem and damage bitcoins reputation for months if not years while we struggle through the madness to determine where the resources will end up in the end. Its going to be a full on battle that will result in *a lot* of losses to customers.
BCH was not a battle, it was a few people waiting in a long line at the restaurant Called BillyBob's and then saying "Its too busy here, we are going to go somewhere else". And then they did, to BillyBeb's. The way they did it still poisoned bitcoin in that they also created a chef incentive program at the other restaurant that encourages chefs to leave their job at the busy restaurant for 1-2 hours during peak time, sabotaging that restaurant, but at least the people just decided to leave and go somewhere else.
With S2X, its as if the customers all decided they wanted to come into the restaurant at once and eat whatever they want however the fuck they want it, and to hell with what other customers thought. So everyone starts cutting in line, breaking out into fist fights over who gets the menu's, etc. During this madness the chefs get confused on who ordered what and people start getting the wrong meals and others no meals at all, despite everyone prepaying for their food.
Now after that madness, who do you think is going to come back to that restaurant for dinner? There is going to be a lot of market share losses due to the drama, and it could take years for the restaurant to recover from it, especially when there are other options out there that work fine right now, like BillyBeb's and Eitherians Peruvian Cuisine. 
Hopefully, my analogies were helpful in illustrating the difference of these two scenarios. 
And BCH wasn't just all beneficial. There are costs associated with its existence and its a thorn in bitcoins side that weakens security. That was not worth the extra $. No amount of $ is ever worth weakening bitcoins security as thats the entire reason bitcoin is fundamentally valuable in the first place.

Bitcoin is not truely decentralized so long as we have developers that are in charge of bitcoin-core. The bigger question is: Is it possible to have this system exist *without* core developers?
Maybe far far in the future, when robots are smarter than humans and can program features without consideration of morality.
In the mean time, the system is very arguably more fair and ethical than current fiat based systems to the democratic peoples. We will see if it continues to be so as this gets bigger and bears heavier burdens and harder decisions.

Correct, it's all about the tx mix. Last analysis by showed around 2.2mb with current p2sh usage. It would take a block full of like 18in1 p2sh txs to create a 4mb block.

I believe thats exactly what they are doing, but perhaps adding cryptographic signatures into the database. If you give key's to a few set of trusted people, and allow them to sign the book, then you can know that only they are capable of signing it and other entries can be ignored.
But in this system there is no true proof of time because it can be back-edited. This is the downside. This is why the blockchain is essential, because no one can go back in time and alter things. When these companies building 'permissioned ledgers' need to prove that something happened at xx:xx on x/x/xxxx im wondering how they are going to prove to everyone else that the entry cannot be modified to show a different timestamp, or even a different signature since the database is not immutable!
there's so many holes with this trusted permissioned ledger talk I dont even understand what the deal is.
So, if banks finally get together and collude and share a database with each other, then yea, they can settle instantly. But.....*they always could have done this*.

in your review you stated that zap haven't seen very many updates over the last 6 months but there was a brand new version released about a day ago. It would be interesting if you retry your experiments with the new zap and if you lower all of your fee requirements for your channels back to defaults for the experiment.
After Reading part 2 and noticing how high you jacked up your fees I think it's worthwhile to try to reduce the amount of channels you have open if CPU usage is a concern, and put fees back to default.
It is certainly a poor experiment if you create all of these unrealistic variables, such as 100x feerates. It feels like you are unintentionally setting yourself up for failure.

Cash is legal tender that *must* be accepted. There are instances in which people brought lawsuits against the debt holders in these scenario's and ended up having their debt's abolished because the court must assume that if the creditor does not accept legal tender to pay the debt, that *the debt must then not exist*.
I encourage Chase to keep going forward with this policy. There are laws that insure that cash can always be used as legal tender to pay debt, and Chase is going to end up fighting a *lot* of court battles over this, and likely loose quite a bit of money on the books over it.

Can you imagine what these people could do to break through resistance or to cause massive margin calls with just 5% of their capital?
Indeed, the market is going to have a *lot more* volatility than whats current once the HFT whales enter the space.

No, just like you cannot envision paypal replacing USD/cash.
Bitcoin is not meant to *replace* nation state currencies, its meant to allow people to have the choice to *opt-out* of nation state currencies.
Nations will continue to use their currencies, both hard and digital, because it makes most sense to operate this way. And then there will be merchants, consumers, businesses etc that will trade other currencies since it makes more sense for them.
Bitcoin is simply another option, but thinking of bitcoin in terms of just a currency is a low bar. Its also a banking settlement system, a public registrar, a vehicle for securities, a few other hundred current use cases and a few thousand or 10's of thousands of future use cases to be found.

Seems pretty self explanatory. Im not sure why you would even need a "sensible explanation" when the situation is so obvious that it should not even need an explanation.
B2X represents a handful of executives from businesses unilaterally deciding consensus rule changes and forcing it upon the network.
Core is not a business. It is a open source community that collaborates on code changes to a public repository. They do not force anyone to upgrade to their software, and definitely not by orchestrating backroom deals to sign letters with factions of the industry in an attempt to force invalid rule changes on everyone else.
This all comes down to the fact that bitcoin is a non-governance system. No one rules it or can make decisions for the system. Either the ecosystem reaches consensus on an upgrade or it does not and the upgrade does not go through. 
You cannot change the rules on everyone without consensus. To do so without replay protection and disguising your nodes as your competitor is as transparent an attack on bitcoin as it gets. To collude with miners to attempt a 51% attack on the network without building consensus is as transparent as it gets.

No, they are known because they signed their little piece of paper attesting to their supporting. Those who didn't, did not support it. Its as simple as that and trying to extrapolate doubt from the situation is manufacturing doubt to try to muddy the waters of the discussion. I reject your tactics of trying to cast shade on the discussion.


This demonstrates a lack of understand on how the bitcoin market works. Its the valuation of bitcoin that determines where miners throw their hashpower.
Unless you think that these institutions are going to use their capital to speculate in markets to influence the price of their token they are trying to force onto the rest of the network? If that is the case, I think there would need to be some transparency on the issue. And it would take a *shitload* of capital to influence the price in a meaningful way across the entire bitcoin market ecosystem. But investments already contributed towards ecosystem business participants have no effect upon exchange based market value.
Like, enough cash that even Barry and the DCG would have a difficult time keeping the pressure up, and definitely not in secret. They would have to disclose their activities with that much capital being thrown at it.

What we really dont know, and I think as bitcoiners should really be questioning is:
Are all these 'blockchains' that these wall street and banking cartels developing merely internal blockchains? Or competing blockchains?
It makes sense that they will just be internal blockchains, the same way that localbitcoins.com or exchanges use the technology. Think a intranet blockchain(offchain solution) vs the internet blockchain (bitcoin)
I guess time will clarify, but its food for thought. We may be seeing the big players embrace the bitcoin blockchain for large movements while keeping their transactions 99% internal for the efficiency of their operation. 
This would make sense from a security standpoint as well, because there's no economic incentive to attack a internal blockchain who's tokens have no value. Its only once those tokens are represented in bitcoin and go on-chain that they have value.  Of course, that would merely make them distributed databases instead of permissionless blockchains, but its a step towards accepting the trojan horse. Hopefully im not just horribly confused on how internal blockchains at exchanges work as I dont work for them and would have no idea how they are setup.

You must not have been around for very long. Coinbase is another centralized bank, they offer services that Bitcoin was literally invented to bypass.
On top of that, their dumbshit CEO apparently has a disease where actually listening to experts is impossible, so instead of supporting segwit he tried to force a hard fork on the network with other centralized monopolies. They were one of the biggest supporters for Bitcoin cash, the literal antagonist to Bitcoin.
Whatever you think coinbase has "done for Bitcoin", I assure you they have done just as much to hurt Bitcoin as well. They are just a business looking to monopolize the Fiat side of things and don't give a shit about Bitcoin.
This is good though as Bitcoin doesn't care. But *I* care, and I care *how* these businesses interact with the community it is supposed to be supporting.

There's a common misconception (or perhaps an assumption?) that is being added as fuel to the discussion that I would like to see addressed. In the paper:


from the network should the block size increase to 8 MB right now.
This statement makes the statement that nodes would drop off the network should the block size increase to 8mb *right now*.
I've read most of this discussion, but no where have I seen any valid research that shows that just because the block size is raised that the blocks will be filled.
All the research I've seen so far, and please correct me if im wrong, shows that miners are incentivized to keep blocks small for propagation reasons.
Are there any economic advantages to *filling up* the blocks? Wouldn't it *cost money* for a miner to pad the block with dummy transactions to increase its size?
Wouldn't this present not only a economic disadvantage (the cost of filling the block) but also a increased orphan risk due to the size increase?
The other side of me wants to argue that *because the capability will exist that someone will test it*, and therefore some spam attack or something will occur that increases the block size to the max, but wouldn't the cost of such a increase (going from 1mb of dummy transactions to 8mb) isolate the possible foul players from participating in such a on-going attack? It seems it would be *very expensive* to keep this type of attack on-going, and to no purpose that I can see other than perhaps negative impact marketing in a attempt to vocalize support for LN or off-chain networks?
Im not trying to vocalize support for BIP101 vs BIP100, but I cant help but think that adding further consensus mechanisms beyond what already exists, and handing the power over to miners could be a mistake long term. Absolute power corrupts absolutely, and the more power we give miners the more incentivized they are to utilize that power to create the most economic incentive for their personal interests. I think that most of the time their personal interests will align with the public good, but it seems that there has been enough research on the topic to show that there *are* actions like *selfish mining* whereby miners do things negative to the network for personal gain. If we give the miners more power now, then it will be near-impossible to take it back (without a hard fork, but with the miners controlling the longest chain, how would that be possible?).
If the research is correct, and the miners do keep blocks to their appropriate sizes based on current market transactional output, then we wouldn't even reach 2mb by the end of 2016, making this whole argument about nodes dropping off silly. I run a raspberry pi node and it runs great, and I think it will run great for years yet, even with BIP 101 because it does not need to handle network traffic that does not exist. Blocksize limit != increased transactional volume. I can always add another drive to my pi, but the bottleneck is in the RAM. Increased network transactions/UXTO space will result in more need for RAM and that is when the PI will no longer keep up. I dont see that happening for years, regardless of whether the blocksize was increased to 8mb or 1GB tomorrow.
This is a little off-topic from the point above, but its always going through my mind. People rely upon miners to act honestly as its in their best interests to ensure the network is healthy, but dont most miners cash their coin to pay for overhead? I know there are no real numbers, but it seems that with the advent of centralized mining, more elite miners are the ones contributing to total hashpower, and a lot of these people are cashing out their rewards. This makes them essential to providing hashing power to the network, but they are no longer investors at this point and they will do whats best for their short-term economic outlook, not long-term. This assumption that all miners are going to do whats right is based on the false assumption that all miners are investors. This is faulty logic IMO.

For the lazy:


 Bitcoin exchanges are a vital component of the Bitcoin ecosystem.
They are a gateway from the classical economy to the cryptocurrency
economy, facilitating the exchange between fiat currency and bitcoins.
However, exchanges are also single points of failure, operating outside
the Bitcoin blockchain, requiring users to entrust them with their
funds in order to operate. In this work we present a solution, and a
proof-of-concept implementation, that allows exchanges to prove their
solvency, without publishing any information of strategic importance.
  


Conclusion  


exchanges have left customers of exchange services somewhat hesitant as there
has often been little transparency when such events took place. Exchanges have
published customer account balances as well as proof of ownership of Bitcoin
addressed which allow for customers and the public to determine the Bitcoin
assets of the exchange.
In this work we propose using an automated software-based audit to determine
the solvency of Bitcoin exchanges without revealing any private data.
Methods are proposed, based on the Flicker Trusted Computing platform, with
which the audit result can be verified and trusted to be correct. An architecture
is proposed which allows for the computation to be split into individual
pieces which iteratively compute a subset of the complete input to overcome the
memory limitations posed by the Flicker platform. The verification methodology
is expanded to cover the iterative execution scenario, allowing for customers of an exchange to verify the inputs to the audit. An analysis of the execution
time showed that it is entirely feasible to conduct audits on a daily basis at the
current estimate size of the Bitcoin ecosystem.

The better advice here is if you print a paper wallet unencrypted, factory reset and then unplug the printer for a few hours on the off chance it has a bios battery (though I've never seen one ever on a consumer printer).

I keep saying this, but the counter argument seems to be:
"Large miners will collude to raise block sizes to choke out small miners"
When I ask how miners can economically artificially increase the size of blocks, I get people saying that they can pad the blocksize with minimal to zero costs. Is this true or false?
This is also ignoring the bitcoin relay network, in which miners can do all sorts of things to pre-relay the block and then add the last nonce upon solving, making the whole 'big block' vs 'little block' argument in relation to orphans a moot point. Its great to see the mining network come up with solutions to solve orphanage rates like that.

Did you listen to the video? He never once said that bitcoin was bad, or that the currency was bad, etc.
Listen to it again, and I'll try to summarize:
He compared bitcoin and blockchain to the automotive industries advancements on engine technology and the value of gasoline during these engineering revolutions. He stated that the price flucuations of gasoline was only loosely linked to the innovation of the engine, but that it gained benefit in price due to the fact that the more cars there are, *the more gasoline is used*
He *is ultimately very accurate and correct in his assessment*, just think on his point for a second:
Bitcoin is the gasoline that the blockchain runs on. You cannot run the blockchain (gasoline engine) without the bitcoin rewards (gasoline). 
You need to understand that satoshi did not create bitcoin as one technology, but as several technologies combined together that created a *system*. The blockchain technology (cryptographic decentralized chained public ledger) *is different* than bitcoin (digital cryptographic tokens).
He's not saying bitcoin is bad, he's saying its essential for the blockchain, but that if experience in other industries proves true, that the price if bitcoin is not tied directly to blockchain innovations but instead tied towards the need of a *finite resource* that is required in order for these innovations to work. The more usage, the more bitcoin is needed, and the more the price will go up.
Frankly this is the best interview I've seen in a while that helps the layman distinguish bitcoin vs blockchain technology *without* the ignorant assumptions and corporate spiel.
And he *did not say* that bitcoin and blockchain technology can be separated or utilized independently without each other.
This dude nailed it.

There are a few crybabies crying 'lawyer', which is absurd in bitcoin culture.

Send him a GPS dog tracker instead, but notify police ahead of time of the scam.
You can buy one here:
If he's a scammer, he will likely not want to have you send it to his house, so he will hopefully agree to do it by arranging some sort of drop location where he is not associated with the address.  Thats what the GPS is for. 
The best way to do this is to get some sort of delicious treat, such as a bun cake or something tasty that wont get ruined inside the package, but can hide a small GPS tracker stuffed up inside.
When he gets it, he will probably be confused, but hopefully the lure of delicious cake will set his scammer mind at ease.
Keep tabs on the tracking of the package, and the GPS details and coordinate with local police. You gotta really get a detective to work with you before hand, offer to communicate to media to him and tell him it would be a *great* exposé on ' to catch a scammer'.
Communicate efficiently with the detective and nab this guy, and get his ass thrown in jail for trying to scam people.
Eat pizza, have a beer and write a reddit report, which will undoubtedly make front page.
If you are bored and really want to do this, let me know, I'll donate towards the tracker. I hate scammers.

Im all for the relay network as it solves a lot of "what if" theories going around in the block size debate, but I hope that everyone understands the dangers of relying on one network for the entire scaling of bitcoin.
This network needs to be made extremely redundant and robust if it is to serve as a catalyst for progression, otherwise I think it defeats the purpose and I would rather side with the small blockers and fight for better decentralization and anti-fragileness.

Basic econ. The amount of monetary supply should equal economic activity. The expansion of the monetary base beyond the economic activity causes inflation, which if it is unreasonably high it simply means the theft of value from the people as their wealth is absorbed by those who create more wealth and then trade that wealth for other tangible and non tangible assets that accumulate value instead of decrease in value. This power has been abused by every single power that has ever held it, history has endless examples of this type of tyranny against the people.
Bitcoin is a limited supply, but why do you think that it is not feasible for expanded global economic activity? You do realize there is currently 2,100,000,000,000,000 satoshi's, right? And that if bitcoin because so very large that 2.1 thousand trillion units of account would not be able to handle the economic activity, it would be capable of changing how many decimals it does go to, creating more units of account? You could add one single decimal place to add 8 thousand trillion units of accounting.
Also, FYI, banks dont see fractional reserves as a problem. They see it as a natural part of monetary policy. That IS how the monetary base does expand. So they would of course not wish to solve something they see as a basic mechanism to the system.

I've asked this question to every critic and unsurprisingly none have answered. Ever.
I have no doubt they keep parroting their ignorance despite facing an event in which their beliefs are challenged. I will never understand it. When someone challenges my beliefs it switches something on inside that makes me want to drop everything and prove them wrong.
Could it really be that all these people are not really people? I've always argued that it's not a conspiracy and just a lot of willful ignorance. But the repetitiveness of this rhetoric without challenge makes me question my beliefs. Maybe it is just a few people trying to create a narrative through brute force and deception.

Awesome, have a well deserved upvote. So listen, me and you probably share a lot of 1:1 beliefs about society, liberty, security, sovereignty, etc. I have no doubt that with both of us being bitcoiners we share a ton of common ground.
But its important to remember that bitcoin is a voluntary system. The power of good money, combined with open source, combined with a voluntary system is a radical system which will make waves across the globe.
I just want to make sure that we don't take our philosophy or ideology, and attempt to entrench others with it. Yes, we need to educate the masses about personal liberty and the draconian aspects of authoritarians in a modern society. 
But the beautiful thing about bitcoin is that people dont need to understand your (or my) philosophy to *benefit from the principals of good money*. Hell, even satoshi's personal philosophy is irrelevant. What matters most is the net benefits society receives by the adoption of good money.
Thats what makes bitcoin so great. Which is why its more important than ever to resist central control *from any direction*. That includes monopolistic miners, manufacturers, exchanges, fiat bridges, banks and yes, even core developers.
I cannot say we can all get along. But we absolutely all can benefit from this beautiful thing called bitcoin.
If people want to donate their hard earned crypto to their governments to ensure they continue to receive health benefits, socialist benefits, etc, that's their choice and we shouldn't interfere.

Glad to see CoinBase following BitFinexs footsteps by declaring support for both chains. To do otherwise would be an atrocious violation of custodial ethics.

Yes. That is correct. None of the people you just listed are experts in bitcoin. How many miners do you know that are contributors to **the bitcoin protocol** ? None? Ok.
How many of the NYA signatories contribute to the **bitcoin protocol** ...none again? OK.
You need to understand the difference between a bitcoin *expert* and a market participant. Just because you can build a website and accept bitcoin *does not make you an expert*.
There are *very few* experts in bitcoin. I would say probably less than 10. Experts would be PhD's in cryptography/mathematics or CS that have a decade + of experience within the industry of distributed systems, cryptography, etc. Very few people outside the cypherpunks qualify in this. I would say Bram Cohen is one of the few, but even he does not understand bitcoin like Adam Back or Nick Szabo. 


Where was the "personal attack" in my comment? I think you are misinterpreting an opinion as an attack on someones character. When someone demonstrates incompetence and you put sunlight on it, that is not a personal attack.

Bitcoin was designed to prevent consolidated centrist structures like coinbase. Clearly they are gearing up for monopolization 101.
We really need decentralized marketplaces with some sort of risk hedge that can be used on Fiat. The problem is that these current p2p options are riddled with fraud. I watched someone do all the right things....only accept high level feedback, require selfie + scans of DL...and they still got screwed with a fraudulent bank wire.
Conbase is filling a role for this need.....but there's no reason that others cannot also fill this role, provided enough capital. We need a lot more competition in the centrist marker to tone down some of the regulatory capture.

I made no mention of blocks because these people are not talking about blockchains. Blockchains imply proof of work. If there is no proof of work, then there is no ordering of blocks, and therefore no blockchain.
Frankly I dont see how these people are going to be convinced that they need to mine their own chain. Why, when its permissioned? They can have all the features they want without the proof of work.
Thats the way they think, yet they are not thinking that this system does not solve any problems. We've had distributed databases for 50 years and this is nothing different. No immutable time stamping. No inherent value associated with the token, just IOU's.

Its not absurd. Coinbase is not a bitcoin company, they are a bank. They act like big brother, monitor your transactions, refuse to process transactions they deem 'suspicious'. Just because they've built their banking infrastructure on the rails of bitcoin does not make them *not a bank*. They are still exactly that. 
Bitcoiners in general are against banks. Bitcoin was made specifically because of the far reaching behaviors banks have inflicted upon society and as a method to bypass their system by creating a whole new system not dependent upon their services.

Please point out where I stated that Moore's law was a fundamental law of nature and that it would 'go forever'. 
Anyone who understands Moore's law understands that it is not infinitely exponential. Stating that is like saying "The sun is hot", no shit Sherlock.
*Some* of the technical components in computing are starting to see a slow down when it comes to Moore's law, but networking is *not* one of those components. The 5g protocol is going to be gbit. We are making huge leaps in advances for networking. Anyone who assumes that Moore's law will not apply to our networking infastructure is ignorant of the research and progression *and by no means should be the lead developer of bitcoin*.

It was a completely different environment. Everything was still very centralized then. It was much easier to coordinate upgrades and make changes.

Mark my words now once this Futures Market shows that segwit2x has a lesser value all of the segwit2x shills will claim that this particular Futures Market is not representative of the entire industry and therefore should not be used to gauge Market sport despite the fact that the accuracy of the bcash Fork was actually pretty spot-on.

Yes, but it is not very easy for that centralized service to know your inner details to know *how* to lie to you that it would make economic sense for them to do so.
If you disagree, please provide examples because I cannot think of any scenario's in which a block explorer lying about # of confirmations or address balance could be used to manipulate the situation to their advantage.
Such a advantage requires pre-existing knowledge of the person they are attempting to obscure information to.
No one doubts that a centralized service could lie, but what would be the purpose of lying? There's a solid reason to not lie, but there's no solid reason *to* lie. The entire bitcoin infrastructure is based on this premise: economic incentive to remain honest.

I think considering the question at hand, his response was rather well suited. *Could* bitcoin enable a *stateless society* ....*all on its own* ?
The obvious answer to me is no, of course not. Bitcoin is not some manifestation of wisdom and morality, the true enabler with a society that is empathetic by nature.
Its a start, and it could be argued to be a catalyst for such a society to build upon as it solves many issues and *could* allow for a free trade system to exist in modern day technological society without government intervention.
But the dough does not the pie make. Bitcoin is a small piece of the puzzle. I would say culture is the larger piece that needs to change.

Ironic, considering that the video right below this one from Noam Chomsky specifically talks about how Milton Friedman's assumption that market based solutions are the answer is just plain wrong.


Other than the obvious? Its a stateless society. This means no state sanctioned military with set rules. If there is no wisdom and morality, then how will we govern ourselves? This idea of a utopia does not exist in human nature, we all have maladies of the mind. There will always be lunatics, psycho's and violent people who wish others harm.

If these people do not have access to internet, how are they to verify that the voucher code they received is valid? I see this as becoming a catalyst for successful economic value transfer (like M-PESA), but there has to be a mechanism to verify that the value token (voucher) is still redeemable.
Also, I would hope that if the recipient wishes to forward the voucher to another recipient of his choosing that a new voucher code would be created in the process. Otherwise you would have several people owning the same voucher.
I can see a future where these voucher codes are stolen by network operators/MITM attacks, especially in 3rd world countries where infrastructure is not as tightly regulated and corruption reigns king.

I think that your (and others) responses are exactly what is needed when discussing new idea's. Sometimes we come up with what we think are great idea's but once they are put through the rumor mill someone ends up coming to a realization about something you missed in your epiphany.
This feels like one of those moments of realization that maybe it was not such a good idea after all. The idea seems to create more attack vectors for gaming the system than it solves. Or perhaps its just trading one burden for another, with no gain in efficiency or logic.

Since this is on and there are going to be those wondering why Bitcoin is rallying, here is the reason.
Bitcoin has been facing a potential split of its both Technical and economic resources as a portion of the economy wants to upgrade the protocol to increase the block size beyond what was just increased 6 weeks ago with the activation of segwit. These supporters are called Segwit2x, S2X, B2X, NYA signatories, etc. They are mostly miners and subsidiaries of Barry Silberts DCG corporation. The only single Bitcoin developer that supports B2X is Jeff Garzik, while 99.9% of Bitcoin experts have taken a public stance against it.
F2POOL had previously announced that they would not be forced to mine the b2x chain but they had continued to Signal the Nya flag while mining their blocks, which is a way for miners to Signal preference to specific upgrades to the Bitcoin protocol. This led to some confusion as to whether this pool would actually abandoned the agreement or not. F2POOL is a major pool with around 10-12% of the hashrate.
This change of signaling combined with the fact that the b2x token is trading at less than one-fifth of the value of a single Bitcoin spells Doom for this particular attempt at forcing a split upon Bitcoin.
Futures Market for B2X token, currently at 18% of btc -
The reason the market is rallying is because there are increasingly significant indicators that the agreement is falling apart and Bitcoin not splitting is good for Bitcoin. It also demonstrates how resilient both the market and the technology is at rebounding attacks against its infrastructure. This particular attempt at hijacking Bitcoins consensus process demonstrates how resilient Bitcoin is against corporate interest attempting to use influence power and money to force invalid rule changes upon the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem.
Bitcoin aka money badger don't care.

I would disagree. Since the bitcoin blockchain is what *defined* what a blockchain is, and all examples of blockchains thus far *are* immutable, then I think its safe to say that *blockchains are immutable ledgers*.
Trying to say otherwise just confuses the issue and makes up new concepts for a term that is already solidly defined.
You want to make a editable blockchain, go for it, but dont call it a blockchain. Call it a distributed database.

And in comments we've seen about a $70 savings of other components. Making it possible to build this same setup for under $200.
Now the big question:
Why not just build this as cheap as possible, for half price, and then clone the OS onto your PI? Does anyone think that if you can cut costs in half that people *wont* do just that? $400 seems a *very* steep 'entry level' product for developers.
If this is to 'bridge the gap' by being the 'AOL CD' of bitcoin, then I think they need to get the price of the unit a little closer to the AOL CD......

Im blown away that the price has not responded to this. If this would have happened in 2013 moon boots would have not even been appropriate. We would have needed *mars suits*.
Today? Not even a fucking hiccup. This is bad. Its bad because when there's negativity the price responds quickly, but when there's positive news it rarely responds.
We are still in the bear market psychology, very very deeply. Its been almost 2 years now and seems we cant dig out of it. I would like to think that this is the currency aspect maturing, and that we have more liquidity....but this is not true. Infact, I think we have *less* liquidity because we have a more diversified market now. When you split 3.5b across 5 markets, its half a billion per market....but split across 15? Or 30?
The order books are not as strong when we are diversified, and all this talk of liquidity providers by exchanges sounds like BS to me, because I dont see any support at all, just the bare market.
Its good to have diversity, but its bad to be stretched thin, and I feel like we are streched thin without any real capital growth.
Im a huge bull at heart, but its disappointing to see huge news like this not even cause a dribble of a bull response.

Who was slamming anyone who had reservations about it? You've completely misconstrued my comments the way you've misconstrued James comment.
Its clear from your responses that its *you* who has a issue misinterpreting peoples words.
I've stated over and over that I dont like his idea and think it has no merit. So what about that dont you understand? Does me stating it *one more time* make it more clear to you?Why cant you just read it the first time and get it through your skull? Why must it need be repeated over and over and over, before you finally understand?
The *only* issue here is people taking a quote out of context, and parroting a completely different idea as if it was James.James *DID NOT* say that he wanted to replace PoW with "Proof by Andreas". Yet you (in the past thread), this other guy, and a bunch of other kids in this thread are all making this claim.
I said it before, and I'll say it again -
People like you are what makes this place unsavory. You've "got it in" for James, and have made it your mission to badger him to fucking death over the issue. I read the thread last time. I saw how you constantly badgered him over the issue even though he clearly told you point blank he did not want to engage with you.
You know *why* he does not want to engage with you? The same reason that I generally dont want to engage with you. Because you take things I say, you misinterpret them, and then you start some reddit bullshit over it. No one wants your fucking drama kid. You are a poison to society. You are like a girl on her period getting emotional, lashing out, and then blaming everyone else as if *they* are the problem.
YOU are the problem. YOU misinterpret what people say, then speak to them directly and put words their mouth they never said. And because of that no one wants to deal with you. You bring nothing of value to this community. All you do is poison the society with your negativity.
But food for thought.....all of this bashing you've done to James. Just stop and think for one second.....what the fuck have you done for bitcoin?
What contributions have you made to this community? What impact have you had? Doesn't it seem overly childish and generally shitty to bash other people who absolutely have made great contributions, while you've done absolutely jack shit nothing? Dont you understand how that mentality is fucking poisonous? You are like a seagull. All you do is flap around, hover, and shit on people.
And before you retort with "Well what have YOU done" ....remember...im not the one flapping around shitting on people. I actually support those who contribute to this society. But you? You are a parasite that gives everyone infections.....and your karma shows it.
You can go and look at the last 2 months of my comments. I generally dont lash out like this, but I am sick and goddamn tired of kids like you making a stink in this place. I've had enough. 
Isn't it already bad enough the dude has left our community? Havn't you little fuckers won, achieved what you wanted? But nooooo, thats not good enough, you have to shit on him AFTER he's already gone.

The best way is to conduct sybil resistant polling on sites like coinbase, blockchain.info and bitpay. It could provide a robust sampling of what users who engage in economic activity think and feel.


Social consensus is just the more broadly and generically used term of "consensus". The reason for this is we are on where the term "consensus" is often generally refered to in reference to the Nakamoto consensus mechanism.

The merits of the function that exist within the code absolutely *will* sell itself.


Which they will do based on the merits offered *by the code*.
Its very simple. Dont try to over complicate this simple thing. There are features and benefits, and people will run the code based on those features and benefits. If the features and benefits are greater than the compromise or the labor involved of upgrading, then users will update their code.
Good code does not need to be sold. You are saying that everything needs PR, thats bullshit and false. If you have a good company and run a good business you dont need good PR, you just need to keep up your quality business practices.
If the code is good enough, then there will be propagation of it. This works through social networks. But the code itself does not need to be sold. You only need 10% of the userbase to be absolutely convinced of a idea for it to propagate through society according to models. We have roughly 90+% conviction on this issue.
To think that it will do anything other than propagate is to ignore how society works.

Just because a piece of data is written into the blockchain does *not* make it true, therefore the same burden of proof must exist for blockchain written data as any data that is currently saved anywhere on the internet.
Whats to prevent the same fraud mechanisms from occurring in writing data to the blockchain vs global data storage with the internet right now? We can just as easily obfuscate data a variety of ways right now via the internet as much as we can via history books: Through confusion, purposeful misleading, massive organized counter opinion, etc etc

Yes and no. The whole point of a math proof is that it simply works. If it did not work, then it wouldn't be a proof. It has to mean what it says and says what it means in a simple and obvious way so that everyone can say "ah yes, this is obviously and undeniably true"
It would be very difficult to formulate a proof that works as intended, yet does something other than intended. You would have to purposefully design it in a very clever way to accomplish this.
So unless you are planning on sabotaging yourself (or perhaps creating a very obvious backdoor), this is not realistic.

Just like you have to learn to watch your gas tank before it goes to E, you need to watch the network to make sure you are paying the miners correctly. Of course, none of this matters because this is *a very short term situation that will only be experienced by those who got into bitcoin early*.
You are completely ignoring that this is a issue with engineering, and that wallet developers need to write better code. It also ignores the fact that SW is 45-60 days from activating and alleviating near 50% blockspace load.

This has been discussed here, bitcointalk and on the devlist pretty actively since 2014 if I'm not mistaken. So yes, years.
As for the why they dont do that, 2mb blocksize = 8mb SW possible blocksize, and the reasoning is that there were some cpu ddos threats that existed at that size. So no, not a joke. The developers are putting safety first, not a bad precedent considering all of the drama we've had over the years with various attack vectors. Do you really want to see 30%+ of the nodes suddenly attacked? With bitcoin as centralized as it is now, opening ourselves to attack vectors that could greatly increase the chances of an actor successfully pulling it off. That's a dooms day scenario, and I dont like playing with fire myself, glad the core dev's dont either.
Im pretty sure those threats still exist, perhaps someone more educated on the topic than I am can illuminate what the progress going forward is to eliminate those attack vectors. Is this something that schnorr signatures are going to help wrap up?

For his own benefit because he invested into Bitcoin.
But I fail to see how this is not relevant to the basic Tennant's of Bitcoin, where it uses self reinforcing greed to perpetuate the network.
This is literally part of bitcoins fundamental design. That greed begets greed.
Sure, you don't have to listen to him.....but don't talk shit either because he's doing Satoshi's work. You are either a bitcoiner that wants to see it's usage spread.....or you are not. Stop fighting the tidal wave.

No, we know exactly who it is, and probably why they are doing it, which is to game the network to maximize fee revenue. This is a exploit not envisioned by satoshi, because it creates a perverse incentive where those who are supposed to be working for the *good* of the network with greed are instead working against it.
From the [LaruentMT article posted by OP, see part 2]( -


These are those who are complicit in this behavior. We all know who is involved with these pools. Clearly there is collusion going on behind the scenes, with company coordination, to collect as much of the spent fee's as possible, to minimize the cost of this behavior and maximize the potential revenue generated by increased fee's.
Watch the documentary on MIT card counting. Pretty much the same plan. If you coordinate with a large enough group, and you spend enough money, with the data known (how many cards/how many blocks/hashpower) there can be a mathematical solution to predicting chance and therefore revenue.
Some of these pools might loose, but overall if they collude they are all going to win big.
And they have, and continue to, **at the expense of bitcoin users, creating ideological rifts, leading literally to the splitting of bitcoin**.
Let that soak in for a minute. Miners, who are supposed to be securing the network, who are paid fucking handsomely for it, such as the [3-4 billion bitmain made]( are instead milking every single penny from the system to the point of not caring how much damage it is doing to the ecosystem that has made them filthy rich, are ultimately the root cause behind the factions in bitcoin. You know the saying...follow the money....
This is the largest failure of bitcoin, and one that im still not sure is going to be fully rectified with LN. It will reduce costs for sure, but I don't think it will solve it. They will just game the system the same way regardless of circumstances.
This is also one of the largest arguments *against* a blocksize increase. If you give miners an economic incentive to maximize revenue, they will persue it *at all costs* as can be demonstrated by these multi-year spam waves. So if you raise the blocksize, miners will simply stuff the blocks full of padded transactions so that they are at the edge again, increasing fee revenue.
With a blocksize increase, the ecosystem is punished twice. Not only will end users pay more in fee's regardless of how large the blocksize is, but node operators will be forced to upgrade hardware to accommodate the increased resource usage. This will undoubtably reduce node counts in a linear fashion, leading to (eventually) strong centralized effects.
I just don't understand all the mining cartel apologists. The whole "its the free market bro" shit. Yea, it is, but its also vulture capitalism. Its squeezing every ounce from your end users (to massive detriment to the network), when instead you could let them thrive, propagate the network and maximize your revenue from increased population/usage.
Those mining groups are not the friend of bitcoin. They will watch it burn because they have already been made filthy fucking rich from their behavior. 
EDIT - Thanks for the gild stranger! We need to get a damn LN tip bot asap so we can start tipping again here! I would love to redistribute some of this reddit wealth to others :)

Yes, but those channels will be opening and closing at a rate of 1/100th or 1/100th or maybe higher than the average transaction rate. Thats the point, that they can open a channel, then do orders of magnitude higher transactions within that channel, and settle all of those 1000's or 10,000's or 100k transactions in *one* blockchain settlement. *While retaining the same security model as the bitcoin blockchain and while having instant confirmations*.
Thats fucking cool as hell. Anyone who is against that is just looneybins.


Because if you compress the signatures (schnorr) and separate the signatures data (SegWit) you will see massive space savings. That does not even take into account the above information about LN and the way it works.
Ok, I'll try to make this simple.
If you run a cookie factory that can make 10,000 cookies a month, you are stuck with 10,000 cookies. However, if you can outsource your work to 9 other factories, you can make 100,000 cookies a month, and you've already worked out the supply so all these factories are making your cookies perfect with the same recipe. They are packaged and distributed safely all with the same uniformity, so that when it gets to your warehouse you cannot tell which cookies came from the factories, and which cookies came from your first.
Now lets assume you had 10,000 per month in demand with your first factory, but the reason you opened the other 9 was because you found a new big buyer who agreed to purchase 85,000 cookies monthly. You have 95,000 in demand, but 100,000 in supply at capacity. You can reduce your labor at your first factory to half speed, producing only 5,000 cookies a month. Which is great, because everyone was overworked and complaining and medical and overtime costs were getting too high.
But now that we've been able to take the load off our shoulders, we can let the other cookie factories take the load since it all works the same. So the costs will come down. There will be competition within the inner market, as these individual cookie factories (LN nodes) all are running with their own internal market, as they are working out payroll, salaries, employee costs, etc.

This is the point that I have used when trying to explain to others why bitcoin will reign supreme. When you concentrate software engineering talent you can tackle bigger obstacles. When you have a team of heavy hitters, they are releasing whitepapers on new innovative cryptographic solutions, vs others desperately trying to implement open source versions of these proposals to their codebase, always playing catchup and never/rarely offering improvements.
There has been innovation in other crypto sectors, but it seems that most (or at least half)of the heavy lifting in the crypto scene is being done by the bitcoin project.
This doesn't guarantee bitcoins success, but it does greatly enhance the probability. 
Those who innovate and pivot will survive, and those who stagnate will die. The best example is BitcoinXT/BU/BitcoinABC vs Bitcoin core. Are you going to choose the repo that innovates little to none and relies upon broken security models, or are you going to bet on the project with constant innovation and acceleration?

No, my argument was not a moralistic one, but one of practical reality. This is just how it works.
It doesn't have to be medicine, it can be any industry. When you have countries that have lower regulations for specific industry types, there will be natural industrial arbitrage that occurs.
But medicine in specific is often done in trials in 3rd world countries that have loose regulations on clinical trials.
Also, lets not pretend that there are prisons where these companies are force feeding slaves drugs to document effects. It works the same way it does anywhere else....you start a trial, you advertise it, and people get paid to do it.
In the end, its *your* choice whether you wish to participate in a drug trial and be compensated for doing so. You don't have to participate, no one is forcing you.

I cant make heads from tails on the Yuan devaluation situation. From all of my reading, it appears the Yuan was in a decades long devaluation until 2013 (for exports reasons), but after that its been appreciating, with occasional devaluations but these devaluations apparently bring it to a level that is still substantially higher than where it was in 2013.
I always see constant talk of Yuan devaluation and then btc rallies. 
But looking at the exchange rate history, it appears that the Yuan has been rallying upwards since 2014...
Seems to me that this should be causing a opposite effect, in that chinese investors should be seeking to hold Yuan instead of dumping it.

I don't look at the mempool everyday, but I do probably once a week and i've not noticed anything change over the last few weeks. If it has, its been so insignificant as to not cause any concern.
transactions have been clearing with 1 sat/byte consistently within a few blocks for at least the past month.
So a standard one input two output transaction (legacy) would be around 192 bytes, which at 0.00000200 satoshis would be a fee right between 1-2 sat/byte.
0.00000200 * 8800 = 0.0176
So, just shy of 2 cents. I think your examples of 21, 35 and 41 cents might demonstrate what behaviors are being automated by the software/client they are using, but is not representative of what *it actually costs to transact*.
Bear in mind that if these transactions were SW, they would be even cheaper, instead of 1.7 cents we would see about 1 cent.
LN is already kicking ass and taking numbers and thats only going to grow exponentially into a massive billion user network in by 2040.

Here is a summary, courtesy of my friend who is a professional scientist from the Salk Institute. I know this is not about bitcoin, but considering the current state of affairs I feel this is an extremely high-quality signal that can help us understand the *political and social* events that are unfolding as we speak. (Anti-SW, big-blockers, anti-core, blockstream FUD propaganda, unconfirmed transactions, etc etc)


I believe that if you want to understand the *why* of peoples irrational or conflicting behavior, that you study the mechanisms behind it.
The emergent behaviors that come from the distribution of information from nodes within a network is a highly valuable resource to understand for effective communication.




This is a great quote because it demonstrates exactly what is occurring. There are intelligent people like Peter R and John Ratcliff who have diverse opinions on the subject, and have convinced a minority of their belief systems, but the minority here is mostly uneducated people who are susceptible to groupthink mentality. You will see these people constantly attacking others in and parroting things, without really providing signal to the issue, and instead offering just a bunch of noise.
I'm going to edit this to point out a few key items I really liked about this paper.
EDIT -


This sets up the scenario for our current Core Vs BU "debate". The Core side see's SegWit as a resolution to scaling concerns, and therefore all of the benefits that come with SegWit are beneficial to the network. This is the central statement coming from Core.
BU's central statement is that scaling should occur on-chain with larger blocksize because it would be economically beneficial to miners and the health of the network, allowing for instant relief to blockspace congestion.
Core supporters have a high certainty of belief on Core's central statement, and thus accepts all of the arguments that follow SegWit adoption (Payment Channels/Lightning network, Malleability Fixes, Linear scaling of sighash operations (ddos protection), increased P2SH security, Script Versioning, Reduction of UTXO growth, a 1.6-2MB blocksize upgrade).
BU supporters have a low certainty of belief on Core's central statement, and a high certainty of belief on BU's central statement, which has created polarized camps.


So if you have a small crowd within a echo chamber and a central trusted authority, this group reaches a consensus on beliefs rapidly. For example, if you think Roger Ver, or Peter R are trusted entities, and you live inside then this formula shows how it is that you've come to the conclusion that you and other people within have established.
This same formula applies to Core as well, though I would make the argument that has a much higher diversity of opinions, and it also has the support of far ranging academics within the field, so it is not so centralized in terms of one central/trusted authority promoting opinions.


This demonstrates how groupthink mentality spread in has poisoned the wells so to speak, leading to the promotion of a "policy decision" fiasco (attempting to HF bitcoin), despite there being very little signal and mostly noise.


It is basically saying that variables that determine a truthful statement are highly affecting on people's belief system, especially if you are connected to individuals in society that you trust and look up to for their thoughts on issues. 
For example, I look up to Noam Chomsky and he can be considered a high-value node in my interpersonal influence system. When Noam recently spoke about how the National Security Panel that is responsible for determining the likelihood nuclear war has put the clock 2 minutes forward, the closest it has ever been (yes, even closer to midnight, which is considered doomsday, than it was in the cold war) to all-out nuclear war. This information, coming from a highly valuable node in my interpersonal network, has modified my belief to be in alignment with the belief that we are now closer to an all-out world war with Russia than we have ever been.

People do not learn how to code in a day. The engineers behind the various LN implementations all have lifetimes of experience in software engineering.

Except for the fact that its already been demonstrated as functional? Perfect? Of course not. What technology is perfect in alpha stage? But you are not really speculating that they wont fine tune routing are you? Because that would be quite an irrational assumption.


Because it moves the load to a distributed node model vs a miner model. Yet uses the miner model (bitcoin blockchain) to secure the P2SH transactions that lock the bitcoin into place to use LN.
So it piggybacks off the bitcoin blockchain's security model, while allowing for a much more robust network. Since there is no blockspace constraint, then there is no cap, so the distributed nodes will share the load, which is a much more effective want to transmit endless amounts of data. It eliminates all sorts of attack vectors. If you dont understand this then you should read up more on lightning and how it works. It seems you've not really thought this part through.


Which is being done with SW. If you mean the direct blocksize, yes, this is also being *prepped* with SW, by fixing the sighash issue with linear scaling. You cannot raise the blocksize until you fix the attack vectors that are introduced with raising the blocksize. That would be like having shitty brakes on your car, and then telling the mechanic to put in a F1 speed motor, but dont worry about the brakes sir, I will be fine........no, thats not how tampering with a 10 billion dollar machine works. You do safety first, then once you are absolutely to the *nTH* degree sure that things are safe, *then* you raise the blocksize.


Who said you needed to use it? Seems like you are complaining about nothing. Continue on using the blockchain dude. No one's forcing you to do anything. When you have invalid complaints, dont voice them. Or voice them to the mirror in your room to yourself, just dont air them here.


Ok. You've now proven that you are completely ignorant to how LN works. No, no no no no. Your BTC are locked in a P2SH tx. NOT locked "on LN". LN cannot change that fact. No amount of LN code will change the fact your BTC are locked in a bitcoin-blockchain P2SH transaction where you have a CSV or CLTV time lock applied so that in a worst case scenario that you get your funds after "x" amount of time.
You really need to read this again -


Again, you completely dont understand how this all works. LN cannot work without bitcoin. Its not a alt coin. It is completely dependant upon the bitcoin blockchain. It cannot break away, it cannot solve bitcoin issues, other than network load. Only bitcoin development can solve bitcoin problems. Hence why SW is needed for LN to work.
These fears you have are erased once you learn how the system works. You just dont understand how the system works. I understand this because its not simple. You cannot expect to read a cryptographers publishing and to understand their high-level mathematics.
Neither can you expect to understand a IT engineers system, if you are not a IT engineer.
Fortunately, I have a strong background in IT for over 15 years, so when it comes to systems design and network topology, I can get it  faster than most.
Just try to not assume too many things. Instead of making statements, you should be asking questions. Most of your commentary should have been formalized as a posing question instead of a direct statement.

Make assumptions and directly imply you know better, and you will be met with hostility a lot of the time. Im not saying thats right, or the best way to communicate, just that its a reality. We are all human and deal with emotions in similar ways, and all of us get annoyed when people who obviously dont get it try to tell other people about "the facts".

For those wondering, I recently replaced the transformer on a old 80's Nintendo neon and it costed about $170. I would imagine cost was probably in the 90-120 range + labor.
So just the PSU is about 20-25% of the cost. Then they have to hand blow and shape the glass tubes. That part shouldn't be that expensive, I watch glass blowers create and give stuff away all the time.
Hardware for such a neon is probably no more than 150 cost for this item, so you are paying approx 300%+ for labor/overhead for the item.
Compare that to retailers or distributors who's profit margins are around 30%.....and I would say these are a bit overpriced.
I would personally consider buying one of these neons if it was closer to $200 .....but with the small one at 450? Not a chance in hell.

"essentially" is not representative of facts. 


Funny, because that's not what all of the engineers who are greatly more educated than you and anyone else on the topic says.
a 2MB regular block will allow for a 8MB SW block to be crafted and used as a ddos attack. 1MB regular non-witness block (as it stands) allows for a 4MB block to be crafted, and a 2MB non-witness block would allow for a 8MB block to be crafted.

You keep using the word "majority" out of context. Yes, the majority of miners started signaling to activate SW. As the community asked them to for years. Did we ask them to sign an agreement to HF to accomplish that?
When someone makes an agreement without your consent that agreement is non-binding and it definitely does not get to change the rules on the entire community.
The *majority of users* did not agree to this proposal.

This outspoken critic, a *regulator of the NYDFS* prior to its pivot towards bitlicense, nonetheless, has done a 180 turn on bitcoin.
This is crucial to understanding how state regulators, federal regulators, financial institutions and all of the rest of the cartels will change their stance on bitcoin when educated.
This man is clearly very very smart. A Yale law graduate that formed the foundation of the legal procedures to extract billions from banks. Banks, that have a endless stream of capital to finance the most brilliant legal minds to fight the exact thing that this man brought against them.
I believe this tale is also a reason of caution. If this regulator who specialized on anti-money laundering sees the benefits to blockchain powered applications, then know that governments around the world will too, and will do everything within their powers to over-regulate the industry and stifle it to the ground with burdensome legal framework.
The best part though? None of it will matter. No matter how much infrastructure they create to regulate, bitcoin is a trojan horse. It can always work outside of their system. Even in the modern day age of TTP, TISA, no matter how much our internet infrastructure is regulated/filtered/spied upon, there will always be a way to circumvent the regulations put in place to absorb our wealth, discourage competition and maintain central control of the financial system.
And there will always be competition within the market, even at a regulation level. If NYDFS over regulates, then some other state will under regulate to encourage business to their state, the same way that Ohio maintains its law that it will always be the first state to take presidential votes. The bar will just move as the game goes further. And if the states collude due to federal force, then other jurisdictions will always be there to balance the dictator force.

This. People are so fragile that when they see a spade called a spade they want to get all SJW about it and talk about hurt feelings.
Guess what? People need to understand when they behave in a stupid manner. If we do not point it out, how are they ever going to learn? People are hard headed, they will continue to repeat their mistakes endlessly if there are not social repercussions for those mistakes.
It is the duty of society to reinforce rational and sane behavior, so that these stupid wielding humans start to understand their wrongs and seek to correct it.
The first step to fixing a problem is acknowledging it. How can you acknowledge a problem if you dont know it exists, and everyone sugar coats everything for you?

Great example that does not work, but provides opportunity for illumination.
This McDonalds you are referencing? Thats like coinbase or circle. They are the warehouses who are doing massive commercial transactions.
Yet, even with all of their volume, the blocksize situation is still fine. Which tells you that there is not nearly enough customer base to justify anything more than a blip on the radar when it comes to increased users.
You realize there needs to be people to buy McDonalds hamburgers right? Take this back to 1850, now imagine mcdonalds in some outback town. You can create a 100 mcdonalds in that town, expand the infrastructure, but if there are not customers its irrelevant.
How many people are in that town? Not enough to buy a million burgers, right? Bitcoin is still in the wild wild west days. Low userbase, edge case uses, etc

Compared to global markets, and currencies? Absolutely, Yes. Also there is context. You are ignoring the amount of transactions per block, how many users that implies are using bitcoin, etc. This really is a very small currency compared to global markets.


The above reasons you mentioned. I dont see a problem here other than you failing to recognize the above facts and then trying to assume otherwise and force your arrogance upon me.


Great, entirely irrelevant to the discussion. We were discussing reality of now, not the potential of the future. We can sit around with our dicks in our hands talking about moon boots until the sun comes up, but that does not change current demand.
Are you really defending these chinese miners with their ponzi scheme like chart? Its so childish its insulting. Its glaringly big block propaganda with no data and pure hopium.
Its entirely a false dichotomy *and* a strawman. Its putting up a sign saying "Look how much money we can make if we raise the blocksize!" all while ignoring the fact that raising the blocksize does not make them more money. 
If you analyze the current economics, it would make them *less* money.
Right now people compete to get blockspace so the fee is higher. If you added blockspace, people would not compete, so there would be no fee market, so fees would drop. This would mean less revenue. The same amount of transactions would occur, they would just occur in 1 block instead of 2 or 3 blocks. At a lesser fee rate.
If your going to try to argue that there would suddenly be more use cases and more people would use bitcoin.....I would say that's a nice theory but completely ignores reality. There are no such use cases right now and there has never been. Whatever micro-transactional economies that have existed have existed off chain, and always will.
Fortunately, we have LN right around the corner ready to launch with SW to give us unlimited scaling capabilities with full decentralization to allow for the organic buildup of bitcoins growth.

When a developer wants to make a change, he submits his change of code included with a specified formatted BIP request that basically says in a formal way "Here's my code and this is why its important".
Then, if the request is serious and not frivolous, it goes through an academic peer review process. The peers within this academia of bitcoin, go through the request and audit it for sanity.
Not just the sanity of the code (bug free), but the sanity of the cause and effect. The ramifications of implementing this code within the project.
The reasons, which are found in the audit, are then posted on the devlist, which is a open discussion panel.
If the code gets through the rigors of peer review, then the code is sanctioned by the *majority* of developers, e.g. they have reached a consensus on the code being fit.
Now, I want you to think of this situation like you would think of global warming, because the parallels are actually quite similar.
97% of scientists are in consensus that global warming is human caused. But, if you think about it, that means 3% really high intelligence high researched smart people thinks *its not human caused*.
But, if you have a sample size of 11,944 abstracts within publications (as in the case of the global warming 97% figure), then you can say that the data pool is quite large and you have a wealth of knowledge to draw from.
Meaning, its a statistically very low probability of the 97% being wrong and the 3% being right.
Now, there are nearly a 100 contributors to the open source bitcoin project. Including people like Rusty Russell, who literally wrote iptables for linux. The incredible talent and experience of these individuals working as a part of Core, or Blockstream or Bitpay or whatever company....all of these people are all high level individuals with decades of programming experience under their belts.
How many are big blockers?
I think...maybe 3? At most. And all lightweights btw. Nothing impressive at all on their resumes. I've actually bothered to look btw. 
So, 97% of bitcoin developers are for the scaling plan put forward by core. And 3% are against it.
You are telling me, that the 3%, which have failed peer review, are more intelligent than the other 97%? And that the 97% is wrong?????
Also, just like how the media and the US population was still having the global warming debate, because one side *was constantly manufacturing doubt through deception*, you have a small minority that is able to convince a much larger and mostly uneducated minority that they are right because these people are not scientists. All while 97% of scientists had reached consensus *years* before all of the debate. Watch [Merchants of Doubt]( one of the most enlightening documentaries of all time.
Doesn't that strike you as oddly similar to this situation? 
When you analyze the bigger picture, you can see how crazy all of this is. Its entirely a lunatic discussion. People who are on the other side of the fence, the *very tiny minority* are absolutely out of their minds or, they are just lacking education....which is what I think 99% of them are. Not the dev's, the community. They are all just very unaware of the facts and the process and the complexity of it all.

Thank you so very much for contributing your lifelong experience in academia to the study and publishing of this topic, something we have long needed. I wanted to ask you to opinionate on some of the following. You said..






I wanted to understand this better, and wondered if you accounted for variables like miner *untrustworthiness*, something we have experienced greatly in the last few years in our economy? We have seen an monopolization upon ASIC fabrication (bitmain, estimated 3-4 billion in revenue) that has lead to anti-competitive effects such as hostile patents (asicboost) which increase centralization through  "cheating" the proof of work, increasing hashrate marketshare, while at the same time reducing the usefulness of the network by mining empty blocks.
If the network size grows, but grows in a way that increases detrimental behaviour (selfish mining, asicboost), does this not reduce trust, and therefore price?
You have directly tied the value of censorship resistance into the value, and the above actions demonstrate attacks upon these properties. How much "weight" did you give to consideration of the balance between network size and the quality of miners?
How does the transactional fees of the Bitcoin network effect price? Did you examine the equilibrium between miner subsidy vs transaction fees, and how those fees impact usage of BTC as a medium of exchange, and how this property relates to the overall value of Bitcoin?
I apologise if this was covered in the paper, I have read the summary but not yet dug deep into the full paper. I suspect most of us here are laymen and won't be able to digest the full academia so your AMA is extremely valuable to us!!!
Thank you @_date: 2015-04-16 20:03:36

It's more simple than that. Bitcoin enables citizens to escape state sanctioned theft, to survive and eat.
It's not about toppling the system, it's about giving people an alternative in the event they are suffering. This transfer of good money from bad money will be *very* slow. There won't be collapses of currencies because of Bitcoin, plain old human greed will do that for us. Fiat is a failure by design, it cannot move beyond a failed state. How valuable are your bolivars right now? Or Zimbabwe million dollar notes?
I actually don't see very much cheering for systematic collapse here. Not sure where your reading this but it's not a majority decision.

Most of them are fools like you who lapped up his shit as if it was precious water.


Hilarious how his ideologies didn't matter once he became corrupted by his own economic incentives. Instead of vouching for decentralization and security of the system to protect wealth from state confiscation (a hardcore libertarian philosophy), he colluded with other large monopolies and attempted to force the ecosystem to adopt a change *only advocated by monopolies*, and did it lying through his teeth the entire time. Even right up until the end he claimed there was "overwhelming consensus" for S2X. Maybe you can forget his lies, but everyone else cannot.
I suppose if you think monopolizing industries and then forcing your users onto the path you think best is part of his "general philosophy on crypto" then maybe he's your hero.
To the rest of us he's just a massive hypocrite that sold his values for money.
Fuck that garbage.

Yup, thats right. You're still refusing to respond to the facts because you understand that if you were to do so, it would make you face the fact that you acted like a little child.
Nice insults though. Anger management? I was angry for like 1 hour when I wrote all that and since then I've had nothing but hilarity for your lack of intellectuality. 
If you are so fearful to focus on the issue at hand, the only reason can be that you understand your position is flawed.

I think there are some pretty gross assumptions being made here. There are real world physical costs that would imply that higher operational costs would lead to less nodes, not the opposite.
The argument that a unrestrained blockchain would attract more support and thereby more node operators does have some merit, but I think the same thing is achievable through decentralized 2nd layer solutions, though with more time. 
Better to do it right and slow, than wrong and quick.

I've seen some data stating that we could move to 4mb with 90%+ nodes intact, but that anything currently above that starts to drop node count. You must remember that a standard blocksize doubles the SW blocksize, so jumping to 2mb makes a 4mb SW block 8MB.  A better compromise would be 0.25-0.50MB blocksize increase.
That was from a year ago, though. Would be curious to see current data.

It's the combination of both encryption *and* routing into one protocol. It *has* to do both, otherwise it would be pointless. 
It feels like semantics to argue from the perspective you are. Yes, LN uses source routing, but then it encrypts that information so that the participants along the route cannot see the destination.
You might be technically correct about the order, but it doesn't detract from his argument that people claimed it would not work, and yet here it is working. Which I believe is his general point. Whether he calls it "onion routing", which *is literally what the specification says* is irrelevant.
Don't harp on the guy, he's using terms straight from LNs GitHub. He's not lying about anything, and if anything you're doing a disservice to the community by trying to muddy the waters arguing over semantics.

We actually do have a clearly unjust law on the books that allows the government to essentially bypass the constitution by charging your property with crime instead of charging the owner, called [Civil Asset Forfeiture]( The practice has been especially abused in the last decade and we are now seeing progress in specific states enacting legislation that protects against this corrupt practice.
Other than that, I cannot think of any other examples that comes to mind that meets your scenario, so our property rights are pretty well preserved minus the civil asset forfeiture bit. Once we establish some legislation on a federal level to close that sneaky practice we are much better protected. Until then we will do it state by state, similar to how medical marijuana has become legal in *most* of the United States.

I did. Considering that was the "source" of all this retardation, you should relisten yourself.
Not once does he say that using andreas as a trusted validator was "THE PLAN". He used his name as a example, as someone who the community knows and trusts, so that people could understand the pro's and con's of the idea. And it was not a central validator idea,  as everyone is saying, it is a trusted oracle / federated system like ripple, if you just stop to think about it for a second.
People are just so fucking stupid that they cannot understand that he did not literally state that he wanted to change PoS to "proof of andreas", he was just mulling over a reputation based model *similar* to proof of state that uses trusted representatives as validators as opposed to PoS where its based on holdings.
The misinformation must stop, and if YOU need to, re-listen so YOU stop spreading the bullshit.
Here you go -
["James [speaking in 3rd person about himself] never argued for Proof Of Stake! Proof of stake I would say is slightly more resistent to centralization than proof of work""]( @ 20:21
54:15 -
"This is not even half baked, its probably not even a 1/10th baked, but if you want to decentralize, why not decentralize? why not provably decentralize? So one way to do that, you got the andreas idea there, what if I picked a thousand people...I dont even care who they are, that I could prove they are a 1000 people, 
so there is some social element here, they would need to identify themselves in some way....so if i pick a thousand people, and now I have all those transactions sent to one of those miners, and they validate and spit it back out to the network, and hopefully with RNG that the next miner would be picked at random"
56:10 -
"And lets take poor andreas name out of this, lets just say person X, gets the first set of transactions, mine them however the hell they way, then it will
randomly go to the next person, they mine them however they want, here mining just means verification, because we no longer need proof of work"
Now, how can you say that someone, who said "And lets take poor andreas name out of this, lets just say person X"  .....and also said "This is not even half baked, its probably not even a 1/10th baked".....
How can you take that as a serious suggestion? They were fucking waxing philosophical. It was a thought experiment. If James was serious about proposing this as a actual theory, he would have put more time into it, researched it, and wrote a paper on it or at the least made a video on it.

No, downplaying the massive destruction to the ecosystem that erik is 100% *personally* responsible for (as one of the S2X signatories) is not appropriate either. Lets not forget erik's "overwhelming consensus" statements when trying to force the rest of the community into his and other monopolies centralization attempts.
We can both accept that what he did here is good, and that what he did before with S2X was *really, really bad*.
And yes, I can quite clearly state  that centralization is the enemy of bitcoin. Erik *strongly* advocated for S2X, which would have resulted in massive centralization. We had a large amount of developers that outright stated that if S2X became bitcoin, then they would have lost interest in developing towards the project. That would have left the talent pool behind, leading to a few rookies taking over the codebase, leading to developer centralization which is just as bad as mining centralization.
And this is perfect 20/20 in hindsight, are we going to forget about [the S2X hardfork one off rookie error by jeff garzik]( that would have caused the bitcoin network to come to a crashing halt?
This is exactly the kind of rookie bullshit we have to avoid, which can only be sustained through a vibrant diverse open source decentralized developer ecosystems.
Unlike *insert 99.9% of other crypto projects here*, which have massive developer centralization issues, leading to....ironically as garzik would say...."The priests replacing the kings", leading to the same issues that centralized systems have had age after age.

Thats right, the payment channel owner is who puts up his coins up as escrow so to speak, so that those coins can be *locked up*, so that those locked up coins can be utilized in LN transactions until the payment channel is closed. Once the payment channel is closed, that escrow is released, so to speak.


SMH, you really dont understand how *any* of this works, do you? Why do you insist on coming to reddit to declare your opinions on something as truth when you completely lack a basic understanding of how the system works?
You are a live example of the [Kruger-Dunning Effect](
You are ignorant. Thats not an intended insult, that's a statement of fact. And the fact that you are ignorant to the facts but come on here acting like you know better is egotistical, immature and insane.
When you open a payment channel, you are doing so by locking the funds in a P2SH address with a CLTV or CSV time lock. That means that your coins will be released at a specific time which is designated at channel opening, so that in the event of the channel operator dying or losing his keys etc etc, *that the funds are never lost*.

Its business as usual. Banks are trying to bypass bitcoin by building 'permissioned' ledgers.
They create the same exact central trust issue, and are just trying to digitize the monetary process further.
They could have done this 30-40 years ago by just agreeing to share databases. They are only doing this now since bitcoin is a true threat to their business model.
It still is.
Everything these banks are doing, while competitive to bitcoin, only furthers to show that bitcoin is a valid technology that they should fear.
While it should put a little fear down bitcoiners throats, I think in the long run bitcoin will prove to be a vastly superior and more flexible project. Remember that banks are banks, and they are just grasping at straws to remain in control of the monetary policy.
This does not solve fractional reserves, it just enables them to do it with greater efficiency. The economic problems we have and the obstacles we face for the future are still present, and the technology they are creating only furthers those problems.
Bitcoin was created to solve the money supply issue, and to put the power of money into the hands of the users, instead of being victim to the banks.
None of the things they are doing are going to help that, infact its the very opposite, they are fighting hard to prevent exactly this.
Now, if our developers could agree on a blocksize raise and JUST DO IT FFS, then there would be more trust in the system and its long term potential. I think that in 5 years we can look back at this moment and go 'phew, that was a close one' as we are scaled to several thousand tx/s on LN and other scalable solutions, while still retaining a decentralized bitcoin.

Do people seriously never look at usernames? It's the only explanation. It's okay to misconstrue misread and to make common mistakes were all humans but this would happen less if we recognize the reputations of regular contributors.
As an extreme example if theymos started ranting about censorship and how this sub is destroying Bitcoin we could obviously laugh at it as a joke because he is who he is. But if someone who we don't know said that we would laugh at them knowing that they've been smoking some shit.
Reputation matters and I wish people paid more attention to it. People often ignore the social layer of Bitcoin and don't realize how powerful it is. 
Bitcoin the open-source cryptography does and should have a don't trust verify philosophy. But when it comes to communication on social networks reputation absolutely matters and greatly influences the way that we think regardless of your personal philosophy on the matter.

Where does it say there are tx's using 0/1 satoshi per byte?


Thats actually really high. Current 70 satoshi's per byte estimated by 21's fee estimator currently dictates a 0.0001582 per 226 bytes.
Which is 1/3rd of 0.0005
So it seems that the bar is way too high? The site should really adjust the metric based on 21 co's fee estimator to give a accurate gauge as to how many tx's are under the current estimated fee, and then to give a better breakdown like...
- This many tx's under 0.00015
- This many tx's under 0.00014
- This many tx's under 0.00013
- This many tx's under 0.00012
- This many tx's under 0.00011
- This many tx's under 0.00010
- This many tx's under 0.00009

The heart of this debate is that crypto-austrians believe that the value of Bitcoin is in it's financial sovereignty, aka it's ability to act as a store of value, protected by from the state. These are usually security maximalists, often called small blockers or decentralists.
Crypto-keynesians believe that the value of Bitcoin is derived from it's ability to fluidly transact, e.g as a medium of exchange. This group is usually referred to as big blockers, and put the ability to transact cheaply as higher priority than maximal security.
The meme has a valid point. You can be a crypto-austrian, spend, and then rebuy. It presents increased tax complications, extra time/labor, both of which can be rationalized if you are an avid Bitcoin supporter.
Jimmy Song [wrote a great article on the subject]( and I think at the least we can walk away better educated and try to understand that both sides have the valid perspectives based on Modern economic theories.
I personally think that the entire debate is a false equivalency because Bitcoin with lightning network will be able to serve as both a store of value and a fluid medium of exchange, making those who argue for the crypto-keynesians side seem narrow on vision.
Why have one or the other when you can have both?

You are trying to compare timelines under different conditions. Classic bubble patterns dont have timelines. You are merely trying to compare past performance to future performance and thats not only irrational but completely outside the scope of discussing the classic bubble phase.
There is no standard timelines. Every situation will fluctuate dependant upon market conditions. You want to ignore the fact that market conditions has changed dramatically between 2013 and now thats your delusion not mine.
Making entirely inaccurate claims like "The last bubble phase of so and so lasted 3-4 weeks" is entirely an irrelevant metric and has no rational bearing upon our discussion.

The fact that you are displaying an attitude of zero-responsibility is what is most concerning to me.
Just like how Clinton denies that she did any wrongdoing with the Top Secret emails. We can argue all day over the extent of legality of her actions, but no one in their rational minds would consider her faultless. She clearly set up a system outside of the classified system to bypass the FOI requests and mishandled security that threatened national security, whether her intentions were morally implicated or not.
Just like you are guilty of setting up (or allowing changes to) security parameters that are provably insecure for your client that resulted in massive losses not just to your client, but to the entire industry as a whole.
The fact that you are sitting here claiming no responsibility shows how reckless and *stupid* you are, and why no one should trust your company. The fact that bitstamp kraken and others are still clients totally amazes me.

Damn good exchange guys. One of the better conversations I've seen on this sub in months!
I even learned a few things. To the response of Treasury Vs Central Banks on Bonds, isn't it all really the same thing? I understand that it is not technically, but when the FED does QE and then buys Bonds, and the treasury sells them bonds....Isn't it all still coming from the same place? I understand the Treasury is still selling it to the banks, but the banks are just printing the money to buy it, so they are creating wealth out of nothing so to speak.  Or perhaps they are generating tokens that are enabling the transfer of wealth from the Treasury to the Central Banks.
I think there's a ring of truth to the Bond market being much less susceptible to crashes, though it seems there is a *lot* more going on than what im aware of in terms of influencing prices and stability.
I see contradictory stories all over the place on the issue -

I also think it's a massive false dichotomy because it fails to appropriately allocate risk with regards to hard Forking.
Can you imagine how many different versions of Bitcoin there would be if every single version of Bitcoin required a hard Fork?
That's the crypto version of hyperinflation. 
Listen I think vitalik is a smart guy, and obviously a thousand times more technically inclined than I am but I think that he couldn't be further from the truth on this one.
We must also remember that this is the guy that advocated for a hard Fork to bail out him and his investors. I wouldn't really weigh his words with too much value because actions speak louder than words.
When you are making the decision on how to upgrade your software you should make it with the best long-term intentions possible that preserves the health of that Network. Constant hard Forks are much more damaging to the ecosystem than a theoretical philosophy on the corrosiveness of soft Forks.
To make an analogy, claiming that soft Forks are corrosive and advocating for hard Forks is like advocating for chopping off your leg because you stubbed your toe.

I think we should create distinctions here. Communication in regards to engineering is *absolutely* a crucial part of an effective team, especially in open source environments.
Which is why the devlist is always active, and anyone at any time can view all of the communication on there at any time -
*Social* communication, is absolutely *not* a part of the developers duties. Though I think any reasonable person would agree that a technological social experiment such as bitcoin does require social elements, communication included.
This is why the bitcoin foundation was a good idea. It created a talking head for bitcoin to attack social issues. But there were also many bad perspectives that came with creating a centralized entity that was prone to corruption and honestly lacked ethics and the credentials necessary to head such a project.
So then we are at a crossroads. Who best to handle social communication? Well, only those developers who's social communication skills are good.
For example is surprisingly effective in his communication, and admirably has the patience of a non-human entity. I don't know where he finds it.
In opposite, luke-jr is probably the worst at communication. 
But is social communication really a good use of 's time? I would like to think that the burnout that comes with constantly engaging with trolls at would take its toll on greg, who is undoubtedly one of the more talented and persistent developers on the bitcoin project.
I sometimes am fearful that the amount of time he contributes to attacking these social issues wont have nearly as much effect as just creating good code would, and that the downside is a psychological toll that makes him a less efficient developer.

At least we agree on one thing. Fortunately, we have engineers lightyears ahead of me and you who are at the realm of this project, putting good work into creating a future proof bitcoin.




And still is working great. Are you one of those "the sky is falling" people? The sky's still there bro.


Organically. Which is why there's no cause for concern. We currently have a network that supports users per day in the thousands. In 2017 we will have a network that supports users in the millions, possibly billions. The growth of the LN network and its competitors will create orders of magnitude higher bandwith capabilities for users.
This entire conversation and every single big blockers disillusioned viewpoint is entirely laughable when you consider the above statement.


Ok! Now you've shown your true colors in an empirical way, you are ignorant of facts. I actually have a background in IT/Networking, so I have a good understanding of network topology. You seem to not understand the hub and spoke model that LN uses, and how it will translate to increased ability to handle user load. That, or if you do understand it, you are under the false impression that it wont scale quickly. I assure you, it will scale much quicker than you think, and drastically faster than organic growth would dictate. To simplify, whatever the needed load of the network will be, LN will greatly outpace that needed growth through node/channel expansion. 


Are you under the assumption that bitcoin will remain at 1MB forever? Obviously you have not been following developer discussion over the past 2 years. At the original scaling bitcoin conference the LN presentation stated that they would like to see an optimal blocksize of 32mb. But such an increase wont be necessary for a *very, very long time*. This is also besides the point, LN uses the main chain as a settlement layer, time is not a issue. Your LN tx's will be instantly confirmed and secure to spend, so it does not matter how many blocks it takes LN to settle.
Fortunately for me, you, and the entire community, *growth is organic* and that allows time for the system to be upgraded. Developers are going to raise the blocksize, but not until they've engineered defensive mechanisms into the system that prevent attack vectors.
There is a lot of complex game theory involved so if you cannot look at the bigger picture you cannot possibly ascertain a reasonable path forward.
If you only open your eyes a crack so you can barely see through your eye lashes, do you think you could accurately paint a picture of the landscape and then give it as instructions to someone as to where they want to go?
You need to open your eyes (brain) fully to all of the information to be able to theorize how to move forward safely.


No, all you've done is to try to dumb down things that cannot be dumbed down. Life does not work that way. Complex situations cannot be simplified. Hopefully I've helped you understand. Im not trying to be condescending, but when people preach blatantly false information they need to be corrected.
That includes myself when I am too disillusioned on a subject, which can happen when I stick my foot in my mouth pretending to understand things I do not. In this situation, it is not the case. I am not the most knowledgeable here, but I am way ahead of the curve of most people here given how much time I have spent studying the protocol and the network.

"Fair" would be calling bitcoin bitcoin, and bitcoin cash bitcoin cash. except thats **NOT** what is going on. Instead, bitcoin.com calls BCH "Bitcoin" and the **real** bitcoin "bitcoin core".
That cannot be construed to be anything other than lies, propaganda and fraud.
If you disagree, *you* are part of the poison on this community. BCH hardforked, becoming a **alt-coin** the moment it decided to step away from bitcoins consensus model.

His reply is.....interesting.....


Is he suggesting that people who are not familiar with the codebase contribute to the project?
I mean, I get it. If you decided to write your project in some new programming language you've created with abstract references, it would diminish the ability of others to contribute to your project.
But thats not whats going on here. We are talking about a code base thats widely recognized and used by programmers around the world.
His logic is basically "Well, people would actually have to *research the code* prior to submitting pull requests."
Well, no fucking duh sherlock. Of course someone needs to be familiar with SW in order to help contribute to it. Im so sorry that there are no easy fixes to a complex problem. Maybe if we put our heads in the sand and ignore reality that will help it?

I got about halfway through and then I realize that this is just really an enormous waste of time. There are a few things that I would actually agree with Roger on but the vast majority of them I wouldn't and all he does is display how technically inept he is.
Samson seems to generalize a lot here and doesn't really go too deep into details so I'm not really getting anything new from him either so it's not really worth watching in my personal opinion.
Roger also constantly engages in whataboutism, where instead of actually addressing the issue he deflects to a different issue and ask what what about this? For someone who constantly does that it is indicative that they are incapable of honest and intellectual debate.
For example the soft fork crap. Roger starts crying about how soft forks are corrosive and forced even though they were opt in and when Samson points out that Satoshi was the inventor of the soft Fork Roger then deflected and said that Satoshi was also the inventor of first seen first included into the block.
It's clearly a deflection since the fact didn't sit well with Rogers cognitive dissonance. Instead of addressing the obvious logical inconsistency with his argument he chose to instead ignore it and deflect.
This shows why it's pointless to debate with people on Rogers level. They are not honest participants in an intellectual debate.

Think of it this way. There will be as many possibilities to create payment channels as there are transactions today. Just replace each transaction with a payment channel tx, and then you have a pipe that can send thousands, 10's of thousands of tx's based off that one payment channel opening.
So uptake will be extremely fast. 
There are between 500-2k transactions per block. 
144 blocks per day, which means up to give or take 250k transactions per day. Do you really think that LN is going to need 250k payment channels in one day?
When you look at the numbers, the question of uptake is not a valid one.

This assumes that everyone who owns Bitcoin has this philosophy. Since that is not the case and will never be the case this scenario can never be true therefore it is pointless speculation.
Also basic economic theory rationalizes that there is an equilibrium to be found and that this threshold is variable for different people meaning that different people will spend their Bitcoin and no longer hold it at different price points. This will lead to Holders becoming Spenders and Bitcoin being used more frequently as a currency beyond the scope of this particular group.

I think it's important to recognize that publicizing a Narcotics Market to what will ultimately be a lot of young kids will enable them to access a lot of drugs that they were previously unable to access. This is where it gets kind of complicated. Because when I was young you just couldn't really get a lot of drugs, there was just no access to them. This was a natural firewall that prevented kids from getting into a lot of trouble not just legally but in terms of psychological health and physical health. So there's a down side effect that this gets easier access to drugs for the youth, and they are going to treat it irresponsibly.
I understand that in places like Portugal the decriminalization of drugs has been a success but one of the main reasons it's been a success is because there's been education on the issues that was also wrapped up into the policy. It wasn't just about making drugs legal it was also about bringing education and awareness to the topic. If you create easier paths for kids to access a wide variety of plausibly dangerous narcotics but you don't have the proper education in place then it's not going to lead to the same outcome as Portugal where overdose rates have been reduced. My fear is is especially with these new opioid drugs like Fentanyl and the other one that's been laid on blotters recently that's killing people is that this unfettered access to new drugs is going to increase the opioid epidemic that is already occurring.
So there's both sides of the coin to think about and I think it's really important that the public has a debate on both the positives and the negatives of the situation so that we can at the least have a rational discussion and provide data to educate the public.

Sigh. You really cannot differentiate between two different contexts?
You are trying to take a old outdated model and apply it forward. You were ignoring evidence that proves your model won't move forward in today's economy.
Economies change, and they change based on information. The cat is out of the bag and you can't stuff it back in, you cannot go back in time and assume that miners who previously did not game the system, *won't do it today*, especially not when we have significant evidence that that's exactly what they have been doing for several years.
Are you really trying to argue that these miners who have now figured out how to game the system are just going to stop doing so, reducing profits, when nothing is stopping them? That would be an form of altruism and engineering a system design around an altruistic assumption is **idiotic**, doubly so when there exists an econmic incentive to do the opposite.
Your logic is broken and it appears you don't grasp all of the information and collateral effects.

He's gone from "not even clearly defined" to this shitpost of a "but its probabilistic routing!" argument.
He's just goalpost moving because his original commentary was disproven, so now instead of actually admitting he was wrong, he's going to dig a hole deep enough for his head to fit into, he's going to stick his head into it, and ignore everything you or anyone else says.

Yet miners are both miners, and full nodes. While you can try to create a distinction between the two, one must accept that those who mine are most likely running full nodes as well.
In the spirit of game theory, lets play your scenario out. Lets say a majority of miners decided to collude on a rule that is controversial, and tries to force the community to accept this rule by only building upon blocks that enforce this rule.
Whats to stop them from running nodes that also enforces this rule? 
In the age where mining has become centralized due to the simple fact of following the path of least resistance (lowered manufacturing and energy consumption costs), if a majority of miners decide to enforce the rule, running a few hundred or even thousand nodes should really be no problem for them.
The question for you is, at what saturation point does this become irrelevant? If there is only 10% of nodes enforcing this rule, and 90% rejecting it, what will happen? Seems to me they only need enough saturation to get to a few major block explorer nodes and they would be more likely to succeed in getting their blocks recorded and propagated and "accepted" by the community as the real bitcoin blockchains history.
It seems that should this occur, the only solution would be a PoW change....and that would be the end of bitcoin. It would be the start of new bitcoin's of course, but the main chain would never recover or be likely to flourish again.




Ironic and sad, because thats exactly the premise that (James D'angelo) had suggested on the bitcoin uncensored podcast, and he got completely hamstrung by the community for it. He did say it was "Half baked, but actually not even half baked more like 1/10th baked", so that meant "dont take this idea seriously", which everyone of course ignored and lynch mobed him for it. Literally never came back after so much of the negative backlash from it.
And it looks like you got similar criticism for the idea.

Conducting trials in countries with lower regulations is how drugs get approved. This is standard practice.
You must prove the safety first, then the efficacy through pre-approved trials, but that cannot happen until you have enough data to prove to the regulators that your trial wont kill anyone.
You are essentially proposing a scenario that would put all drugs in a chicken and egg scenario, where they cannot prove safety because they are not allowed to conduct trials in other countries. 
That would be incredibly damaging to humankind and the progress of medicine.

It does. Bitcoin has never stopped working. Are you merely suggesting that we shift the cost from the users who are buying and selling to node operators? Because that type of resource shift has enormous implications on security. I've already opinionated that increasing blocksize is a circular path of doom, and backed my reasoning.
I would rather have a secure expensive decentralized network than a cheap centralized network. I mean think about it for a second, we already have the latter. What good is Bitcoin if it does not improve upon existing models?

What do you think the 100 developers that engineer for bitcoin and bitcoin projects have been doing these past 3 years? Sitting around with their right thumb in their assholes with their left thumb in their mouths?
They've been building *redundant systems*, that will maintain optimal bitcoin network infrastructure efficiency.


Why do you persist in remaining ignorant? Why must other people need to shove facts down your throat? Instead of assuming you are right all the time, which is just fucking annoying as hell, when someone tells you something why dont you instead research it and get back to them on the validity of their and your statements?
Look at all the complaints here -
No network has 100% uptime and your assertion that it needs to be up 100% of the time only shows what a childish idiot you are. By your own words above, both Mastercard and VISA (and every payment network ever in existence) are "unreliable and useless". Its impossible to take you seriously when you are so ignorant to the facts. I know what happens after this point and its always "goal post moving". Rarely do ignorant little trolls like you admit they are wrong, instead when you are faced with clear contradictions of your previous statements you furiously think how you can squirm out of it, and then shift your position.
The whole thing is even more fucking stupid when you consider the fact that bitcoin has actually had *better uptime than any and all* of the payment networks. Just because you paid a fee too low *does not mean bitcoin is not working*. Bitcoin is still working fine, you are just an idiot because you forgot to put gas in your car before deciding to take a long drive.
The only person who is to blame is YOU, for not paying the miners correctly. 
You do not get anymore of my time. You've demonstrated over and over that you are not only clueless, but you are arrogant *and* stupid, a dangerous combo. When people who are clearly more educated and experienced than you tell you things....just shut the fuck up and actually listen.

You mean the same way that its uneconomical for people to conduct spam attacks on the network?
Yet.....here they are, still happening.
Just because something is irrational or uneconomic does not mean that we should not prepare for it. It also ignores the fact that as bitcoin matures, it becomes more and more "sound money", which means that central banks may start looking at bitcoin as a threat. Not now of course, but soon ™. This illustrates how outside actors could have a economic interest to see bitcoin suffer, which would make a irrational scenario rational. Thats just one thought-of example. What about those examples not thought of?
The system needs to be engineered to take these attack vectors into account *years* before they occur.

The evidence is in the code. Feel free to read it anytime, it's open source.
Also the term "well" is subjective. Onion routing is not meant to be more efficient, obviously there is some efficiency lost with the mixing.
So the real question is, do you understand what onion routing is, and have you set your expectations appropriately? That would vastly change the way that you perceive the routing as "well".


Who cares with ignorant people say? There are always going to be idiots making ignorant arguments against the technology, why should we care? These are the same idiots that called it vaporware, the same idiots that said that it will be a centralized Hub not even realizing that bitcoin's Broadcast Network is basically a gigantic Hub on chain, and said that routing will never work.
They were wrong on everything else why would we give two fucks on one more thing that they are obviously wrong on?
With that said I encourage and approve of research examining the properties of the network. Information is good and we could use every little bit we can have. But please let's not base that research on the premise that there are a few ignorant altcoin shitposters crying about things they don't understand.

Well son, long before the days of cryptocurrencies, we had to exchange tree skins that were combined with plastic with old guys printed on them as a form of money. Yes, believe it or not we *physically* handed them this "paper" money, and they would often give us paper money back, along with metals cut in the shape of circles as change!
Our governments used to back these paper monies with actual real gold, and then decided it would be better to just outlaw gold, confiscate it, then eventually let everyone have it back after the price had skyrocketed. Eventually, they got rid of that idea all together, and decided to remove the backing and replace it with.....get this.....**nothing**.
Well, unless you see our ability to create a debt society, forcing citizens to pay the government in the form of taxes, inflating the value of the money they did have, and threatening the world with guns and nuclear boms as a way of "backing" the money.

No, that was *not* what you said, nor was that the content of the discussion.


You said your fear was about uptake. The establishment of payment channels on LN network. You speculated that with a 1MB blocksize that there would not be enough capacity for LN payment channels to be established to take the load off the blockchain.
At least, that is what I gathered you were trying to argue, though you did not put it so succinctly.

Do yourself a favor, boot into this OS, open up terminal or a mail client or whatever other built-in live applications that exist on this OS.
Try to use them with that onion turned off.
You'll quickly figure out that there is no routing. Thats because the OS is designed to run entirely through TOR. I wrote this on my first reply to you, but here you are still clueless on these facts. According to the documentation, only a "special browser" is allowed to route through your regular connection. Every other single application and the OS is designed to route through TOR. Which means that you cannot just setup a bitcoin node and tell it to run through your connection without tor. 
Why is it that I've never even used this, but 5 minutes of research can tell me this, but you, who claims to have used this, do not know this? Im no expert on live distributions, but I have 20+ years in networking and understand things at a protocol level. I understand how routes are used to tunnel network traffic, and this OS clearly has built-in routes specifically for TOR functionality at its network stack. There is only one exception, explained above.
Really man, you gotta stop pretending like you are so educated on topics you are clearly not educated on. Its just arrogant and stupid.

"[It would be nice to keep the blk*.dat files small as long as we can.](
For anyone wondering. However, I think the full quote should be included and it should be understood that these are just the files stored on disk and it does not reference actual blocksize, just the size of the .dat files. One could make the assumption that larger blocks = larger .dat files, though its not explicitly said. Also, context, see below.






He basically said that when we are at the point where we are now, where users have long allowed to just be users, and not participants (nodes), that "it would not matter". I *think* he is referring to the blocksize, and would speculate that his [previous comment]( about outsourcing to "farming nodes" would be applicable to provide greater context.
However, I think its pretty clear at this point that satoshi was wrong on this point. A few replies later on in the mail-archive you can read [Hal Finney]( talk about how bitcoin seems resistant to attack, like bittorrent and the tor network.
But it is not possible for bitcoin to remain resistant to attack if there is a centralization of node "farms", especially if where satoshi [wrote here]( were to hold true -


Now....does any bitcoiner really believe that bitcoin can remain censorship resistant if there is ONE data center hosting a thousand nodes all connected to ONE wan-connected node?
That means that you would only have to attack a single node to gain control of the entire network. 
Maybe satoshi was not clear in this regard, maybe there is later writings explaining this better, but I think this highlights a very rational reason to not treat satoshi like a god. Yes, he's brilliant yes we have everything to be thankful to him for, but when you start treating bitcoin like a religion thats a problem.

This is not founded in any logic at all. You honestly think that LN bitcoin node operators care about $ value?
The volatility of bitcoin has *nothing* to do with the length of time that payment channels remain open or closed. 
You are forgetting that once LN becomes established you can trade your value using LN. You wont need to settle on chain unless you have someone who specifically wants a on-chain btc transaction.
Once LN is established, LN and BTC will be in parity. All major places will accept a LN tx the same as they would a BTC tx.

I thought blockchain.info integrated dynamic fee's with their new wallet? I think they are probably just having them confirm in 2-3 blocks by default as a low/conservation approach. Which is fine, literally 99.9% of the time. Its just that the 0.01% happens, and then everyone makes a big stink. But think for a second, actually do the math....how many hours out of the past year have we dealt with this scenario? Like, a fraction of 1%.
How often has your favorite website gone down? dyndns iptv ddos just took down like 1/3rd of the internet for half a day.  Or how many times did you need to reboot your computer, or your router? These are parts of life. Expecting everything to always be perfect is insane. 
Im pretty sure you can tell it to price fee's to confirm at next block instead.
Yes, people will get pissed at bitcoin, and in the process they will learn about bitcoin. Bitcoin is not a centralized service where one person can push a button and *poof*, magic, its fixed!
Decentralized networks rely on slow organic evolution to resolve issues. There is a learning curve both for the user, and for the ecosystem as a whole.
So, if you are a new person driving a car, you might accidentally run out of gas because you are not paying attention. I'm sure most of you can remember a time that happened when you were young. I can remember that day.
How is that any different from a new user learning about fee rates? After the experience, they'll figure out how to adjust their wallets, and then they wont have that problem again *and* we will have a better educated userbase. With the positive you'll not run out of gas again!
What you guys are not thinking about is that everything everywhere has hiccups, and these hiccups are fantastic *learning experiences*.
If you build it they will come. If you think that these hiccups are going to destroy bitcoin you are smoking some damn good shit, pass it my way. With what we got around the corner, there aint nothing stopping bitcoin.
Sit back, relax, smoke one, and tell your customers to set their wallets to confirm in next block instead. If their wallet doesnt have it, recommend a wallet that does.

Great response, but I think thats further back then what im referring to. I believe people widely holding the belief that decentralization was an essential property of bitcoin pre-dates the community split.
It wasn't until Gavin started spreading big block gospel that we saw the emergence of anti-decentralists.
Im more interested in widely held mis-beliefs by that side, and how they have evolved.
The beliefs tend to shift over time, so if we say SW for example, the belief was "SW is technical debt and bad" (A) then "HF is better, SW not needed, evil blorgstream" (B) then "SW *might* be ok, but we really need a HF" (C) to "EC is god, all hail EC" (D) to "We *probably* could use SW and im not against it, but I would like to see a HF instead" (E) to "EC is a bad idea, lets get SW in so we can use LN" (F)
Its the transition of A-F that im interested in, the moving of beliefs over time.

By looking at basic assumptions. If this is the bear trap then we've not even launched into the media attention let alone the delusion phase. Look at a bitcoin graph. Look at the scale. If what we experienced in growth in the last 30 days is just the bear trap, then you need to multiply that growth by 20-30x to fit the bubble phase.
That clearly indicates more than 20k btc.
So there are some basic assumptions here....either.....you don't think that bitcoin has traditional bubble phases (easily disproven considering we have evidence it does) ....or you think that it its at the start of the bubble. (bear trap).
Correct my assumptions, im willing to listen, but im looking at some really basic information here and I dont see how I've misinterpreted it.

An oft repeated theme that I have heard from many developers is that if bitcoin requires social construction to suceed then it has already failed and therefore it is an uninteresting technology.
Bitcoin needs to be anti-fragile in a way that even when faced with social attacks, that it still rebuffs them and plods on.
I get what you are saying, and I dont disagree in principal, but the reality is....
Its complicated.
I think the best way for bitcoin to succeed is for the engineers to continue kicking motherfucking ass like they have been, giving intense signal over noise ratio in the form of working code.
This is the most effective tool in their arsenal to succeed against social problems, such as a very small minority who likes to shout pseudoscience really loudly.

He stated he had a "half baked idea" that he admitted he had not thought through yet, and talked about a proof of stake system with federated nodes replaced by trustworthy public figures. He used Andreas as A EXAMPLE, not as a literal plan. So please stop spreading lies, it's very immature. Also, there's a VERY BIG difference between using ONE trusted oracle, and a large number of random oracles. Implying that he wanted to switch PoW to "proof of andreas" is incredibly disingenuous and badly misportrays the idea he was delivering. And im NOT saying the idea he was delivering was a good one, just that YOU and every other turd parrot here is taking his words badly out of context.
It's not very different from ripple or any other federated model, but the point was he was not trying to push it or sell it, it was just a thought. But shitty little children took what he said as if was his master thesis and trolled the fuck out of him to the point that he doesn't want to deal with the drama.
The same way all the big block kids poisoned the atmosphere with constant attacks and burned some really important people out.
Thanks to shitty kids we lost a brilliant mind, and it's comments like this that make this place really frustrating and not enjoyable. It's pathetic to see misinformation reported as if it's a fact, and I see all these other little turds parroting it. Stop parroting misinformation you turds.

"**This is not even half baked, its probably not even a 1/10th baked**, but if you want to decentralize, why not decentralize? why not provably decentralize? So one way to do that, you got the andreas idea there, what if I picked a thousand people...I dont even care who they are, that I could prove they are a 1000 people, 
so there is some social element here, they would need to identify themselves in some way....so if i pick a thousand people, and now I have all those transactions sent to one of those miners, and they validate and spit it back out to the network, and hopefully with RNG that the next miner would be picked at random"

"And **lets take poor andreas name out of this**, lets just say person X, gets the first set of transactions, mine them however the hell they way, then it will
randomly go to the next person, they mine them however they want, here mining just means verification, because we no longer need proof of work"
Now, how can you say that someone, who said "And lets take poor andreas name out of this, lets just say person X"  .....and also said "This is not even half baked, its probably not even a 1/10th baked".....
How can you take that as a serious suggestion? They were fucking waxing philosophical. It was a thought experiment. If James was serious about proposing this as a actual theory, he would have put more time into it, researched it, and wrote a paper on it or at the least made a video on it.

Agreed, and this is something I noticed years ago. Bitcoin does not have perfectly aligned incentive structures. Miners can fabricate transactions and fee's to game the system, resulting in higher costs to the end users.
But this is where the irony sets in. The people on the bigger block/BU/Bcash/bicoinxt side have notoriously supported mining cartels. *The same mining cartels caught red handed manipulating the fee market by spamming the blockchain*.


How does Plasma and Sharding fix the fee incentivization issue? I could understand if one made the argument that DAG systems fix it by literally removing the blockchain and miners all together (though I think these systems wont hold value over time), but not blockchain assets.


Ignore the obvious by all means, your bad.

I might point out that these remarks from satoshi are over 1 year *after* the whitepaper release, meaning they are more well formed concepts that satoshi had time to think through after a year of bitcoin existing. This quote right here demonstrates that satoshi thought there could be instances in which there was a "higher accumulation of proof of work" on an **invalid** chain.
Clearly his opinion on the subject was evolving, and would have continued to evolve had he been around. Its pointless to speculate "what would he think now", because one ....satoshi is not god, and two, he decided to leave, and pandering to a fasle prophet serves no one.
There are no gods in bitcoinland. People who fall prey to this "we MUST trust SOMEONE" ideology are the idiots that keep reinventing/enabling the same stupid centralized systems that fail over and over.

@_date: 2018-04-04 01:05:04


So why did bitcoin succeed when it was worth pennies?


If you studied the technical side of bitcoin you would understand its like the internet in the early 90's. The foundation was laid, but scaling was a issue.
So how did we scale it?
With layer 2 networks.
These complications you see are the same complications with *literally every single piece of technology ever*. 
You are being very short sighted by not learning the same mistake that has been repeated since the dawn of civilization. Horse and Buggy carriages said that the car would never catch on. Radio executives had the chance to buy into telephone technology but refused, stating it was "too complicated". 
Or even better, how about Paul Krugman?


The story is the same story every single time. People with no forward thinking vision who are stuck in tiny little boxes of their own making being completely non comprehending of how technology works, advances, or scales.
Im telling you as straight and direct as I can ....do you want to be on the right side of history? Or do you want to be a dinosaur?
You can keep advocating for horse and buggies, radio, fax machines and the like, or you can recognize that literally the most experienced and brilliant engineers are designing the Lightning Network.
Do you really not know who the people are working on the project? People like Rusty Russell, who literally wrote iptables and ipchain (network protocols) for linux, the operating system that powers the internet?
People like Nick Szabo, who is the most likely person to be satoshi, strongly advocates for 2nd layer scaling networks. 
Im not sure why you would ignore every expert on the topic, but there has been consensus for years that this is the most intelligent way to scale the system.
Reputations and experience *actually do matter* and its not an appeal to authority to say that you want a experienced plumber to fix your plumbing instead of jose, who you just picked up near the home depot.


Much better, and getting closer!

Yes that is correct although it will reduce the damage greatly. This is all about gaming the system to maximize profits by redistributing cost onto the backs of end-users.
It's normal for end users to pay to use the network what's not normal is when the end users are gamed by colluding companies to massively increase the cost of the product or service.
What we are seeing is massive centralization that has allowed collusion that has allowed these behaviors to become effective.
The end result is that with a highly utilized lightning Network the consumers will end up being penalized less since the majority of their Commerce will exist on that second layer Network and not the first.
To put it simply if you conduct a hundred transactions a year on Chain versus 99 of them off chain then you only get raped once versus raped a hundred times.

Thats incredibly narrow.
Roger is spreading his propaganda on , bitcoin.com and the bitcoin twitter handle, meanwhile bitcoin core developers are hard at non-stop work improving the protocol and overcoming engineering challenges.
Saying this scenario is embarassing would be implying a false equivolency. 
The scenario is one sided. What propaganda has bitcoin core developers advertised? What domains have they purchased? What program do they run where they pay people to retweet/repost information thats specific to their narrative?
Grouping those two groups of people (bitcoin core developers vs BCH ) and acting like the behavior between the two is somehow equal is really absurd.
You have literal scammers/fraudsters (CSW, Calvin Ayre, Roger) who are engaging in the same fraudulent and manipulative behaviors, and then you have a bunch of open source software engineers hard at work with their heads down 24/7.
It is factually misrepresentative to claim these groups have anything in common, and the video you posted implies that these are two childishly equal ....is absolutely incorrect.
If the video was a Grandpa spanking one of the children for stealing the pacifier from the other, then I would say its more accurate, with grandpa being bitcoin core developers and *both* children being CSW/Roger.

We need to balance the costs vs the benefits of those "solutions" to determine which has the best long term net benefit to bitcoin.
Technologies like SW+LN drastically reduce blockspace demand, fee rates and confirmation times. This is a tradeoff with all benefits and no negatives.
Hardforking to increase max blocksize is a "solution" that accomplishes the goal of reducing fee rates, but at the same time sacrifices long term security for short term profit. Along with that it merely re-aligns the cost of the network from users to node operators.
Someone has to pay for that transaction and that should be the users of the network. Mining has become centralized so we cannot rely upon mining nodes to be the decentralized node operators that creates the stability we need. So instead we have to rely on non-mining full nodes to take over that share of responsibility.
But they are not paid.
But in LN they **are paid**. This is why LN is the smartest path forward. Because it **fixes the incentive misalignment and allows nodes to be economically rewarded for their participation**.
Bitcoin failed at this. Its one of its biggest flaws. Satoshi didn't predict that this split would occur and that we would have nodes not being economically rewarded.
We must fix that.
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:08:26


Yes, he likes to ignore the fact that SW is a blocksize increase and then goal post shifts into oblivion.
I've been on a million rabbit holes with . He just goal post shifts you forever.
The problem is he's intelligent enough to keep digging in a way that is not totally and completely stupid. He's entrenched enough that he believes the idea's he keeps bouncing, even though they've been corrected a thousand times over the past year.
So you get stuck in this situation where it takes 10x more energy to dispute him than it would any other normal person. He's a clear example of [selective skepticism as talked about in this reserch]( where he is doing the opposite of confirmation bias and selectively ignores the truths of others arguments because it goes against his ideological beliefs.


The truthful answer is they have lost trust. This has long not been about facts or technical merits but instead about ideological positions combined with identity politics.
He has clearly positioned his identity with the BU/Classic/XT camp, so he opens his brain to the speeches by Gavin, Garzik, Roger Ver, Falkvinge, etc. Anyone who is not a part of that identity group (which essentially means 99% of the expert community) he closes his brain off to facts no matter how rational they are.
He can't help it. He's become so entrenched in the dogma of that identity group that now his own amygdala creates protective barriers from any information that would penetrate that identity.
If you listen to those podcasts (and everyone really should, they are very very good), at the very end they talk about solutions. The best solution that they advocate is the "replace the table leg" solution.
It basically says that when you remove a pillar of someones belief by attacking it with indisputable evidence, they will "backfire" and reinforce the leg that was struck out with even stronger convictions.
The key is to replace the leg when you attack it.
For example.
He wants a blocksize increase to fix the problem. Thats great, SW *is* a blocksize increase and not only does it increase the space and amount of transactions it can hold, but it also realigns the cost matrix so that it creates a optimal UTXO balance. This will enable lower resource nodes to continue to operate optimally for longer as we increase in blockspace requirements.
So we struck the table leg out from under him and replaced it with a new one.

The point was that a equilibrium was found. I dont know how long you've been around but when Core first started talking about the fee market approach there was enormous pushback from the BitcoinXT/Classic "team" to that approach stating that before you knew it we would have $20 transactions, no ceiling blah blah.
This proves their fears were wrong and there absolutely is a market based balancing mechanism that is in play. 2 months of stable fee data proves that conclusively. In in the rally, during the rally and through this dump fee rates remained reasonably stable.
I will agree that since the 1st of the year the hike has been large. Thats what happens when you have a average blocksize of 850kb vs 950kb ...as space becomes more sparse competition increases. But now that we've maxed out blockspace and had a few months to see how the fee's are handled we have a clear view of what the fee market has to offer.
Considering that we have almost a 100 btc in fee's left on the plate right now in unconfirmed transactions, that proves that this fee market approach is capable of maintaining miner revenue once the fee subsidy halves and continues to halve.
This is GREAT for bitcoin.

This would indicate a unlimited supply of money sitting on bitfinex? There's only so much customer assets that can continue to buy btc and bitfinex has its problems weeks ago. Im sure the supply has run well dry. The only participants that are left are those with access to taiwanese banks that can still get their money out and participate.


Bitcoin is subject to market forces. So long as there exists national borders with nations who have different laws on manufacturing regulations and places with different electricity costs, then there will be different barriers to entry.
We cannot solve this problem. Only time can. The only hope we have is that once ASICs have reached moores law that competition within the market will grow and prices will go down benefiting consumer adoption.
Im afraid there's simply nothing we can do about this problem, other than a POW change.

If SW were active today and wallets were optimizing transactions based on the realigned SW cost structure, would you care to put an educated guess on how many more transactions we could fit per block on top of this model?
My *assumption* is with a cheaper means to transact, it would reduce p2pkh and increase p2sh usage since it will be cheaper with SW. Economical incentive should drive wallets to auto-use the cheapest method, which should use more witness space and open up even more traditional blockspace for legacy addresses that are still utilized. 
Please correct any false assumptions, thanks.

No, you can. How many new businesses and markets have started accepting other alt coins?
Sure, we know that drug sites accept Monero, because its designed for extreme privacy. That was going to happen regardless of how well bitcoin progressed.
The more that we see real economic activity utilized by alt coins the more that we know we are losing the war. 
Considering that LN has sphynx onion like routing for extreme privacy and near free 0 conf transactions, once we get SW activated we will see a huge uptick in LN based transactions for privacy minded purchases.
If we didn't have a chinese miner cabal stalling bitcoin we would already be there. If you want to point fingers, point it at the malicious actors purposefully blocking progress.

Well, that at least makes some sense. Thank you.
But, again, they still cannot prevent hackers from getting in and stealing. What they can prevent is some fat french fuck from running a fractional reserve because he lost all his coins and doesnt know how to get out of the hole. Keep in mind that auditing companies cant magically make the coin re-appear, but they can shut operations down if they see it has occurred and the owner is not acting responsibly. 
Which again, does nothing to help prevent customers from losing money. The only good argument for regulation is that it could force the market players to be insured against loss. This seems like a good thing to me if you want to get into high stakes gambling holding onto other peoples money.
But thats not all they do. This is about power and money, and how much they can control you and absorb from you, and how much money gets stuffed into their pockets from incumbents to prevent the little guys from competing. Look at how much a bitlicense application costs sometimes for reference. 100k.
Of course, the exchanges can already do proof of reserves, we just as a consumer industry have not held them accountable for this and therefore the companies have gone slack on this topic and do not give a shit anymore. Why when theres no pressure? We can self regulate, but we have to be more forceful as a community to pressure exchanges into this. So long as people keep trading on these sites without proof of reserves, then we fail at self regulation.

Thats literally the same argument Christians use against atheists, claiming that because they do not have a formulated set of rules/morals to live by, that the world would result in anarchy and chaos if everyone was not a christian.

That can be applied to anything that is complex. The statement deflects from the fact that it is *not* user friendly.
If my grandma can't use it, it probably won't gain worldwide usage at a high adoption level. But what if it's too confusing for a teenager or a slightly tech oriented person?
That means it will *never* gain any type of widespread adoption.
We should instead focus on being honest and saying it how it is and encouraging UI/design improvements.
As an example I would imagine that prior to package managers for Linux people were not very good at updating their software. This likely led to security vulnerabilities which reduce the quality of the software. By creating user friendly package managers it allowed even non-technical Linux users to update their software on their systems.
A clunky UI or design really prevents the bootstrapping of a new technology. Lightning Network won't gain widespread adoption until we have a user interface that my grandma or my teenage cousin can use.

I would strongly disagree with that comment because there is no way to filter the noise out.
Take a look at gavin's AMA. I tried to read and participate within that thread, and take a look at the timestamp from his first post to the post where he said something along the lines of "ok guys, getting towards the end of this"
You'll see how quickly he burnt out.
You are forcing really really important people to wade through trash, wasting their valuable time to do a AMA without a way to get rid of the noise.
The AMA's always work best on reddit because we can see which questions are most valid in a very easy way.
Im going to state it again:
There are some really good open source alternatives out there that offer upvoting/downvoting in a forum layout. You paid 10 times too much for what is really a very simple and basic forum. Im not sure if you are lying about the amount paid, but you got robbed blind if you really did pay that much.
The functionality of your forums is limited SOLELY AND ONLY by the lack of upvoting and downvoting. 
They are using discourse, which is a open source platform that is amazing, full featured, and allows for upvoting and downvoting.
If you are serious about making a place for central discussion in the bitcoin community, then please stop ignoring us when we are telling you directly what the solution is. AFAIK, you've not responded to anyone when they've mentioned this to you and it shows how arrogant you are.

@_date: 2017-10-09 18:29:12
Ok. So the original context was....


Which i responded to, and then you responded...


First, there are some complications here. One, B2X does not have 95%, they have about 83-85% of hashpower at best when you consider F2Pool, Slush and the others who have said they would not mine B2X.
So if you want to base your terms on B2X having 95% of the hashpower then the bet is a non-starter because its already been established directly from the miners mouths that they will not contribute their hashpower, so therefore they could not possibly have 95%.
So then the question that must be asked is ... At the legacy chain having 15% hashpower, do you still think it will not survive?
Even if your answer is yes, im highly suspicious of B2X getting 85%, especially since [the bitfinex futures market shows B2X at 25% the value of BTC](
When miners realize they are going to loose the majority of their profits mining B2X, how many do you think are going to "stick to the agreement", especially considering we've already seen some of the biggest ones (Antpool and subsidiaries) abandon BTC for BCH? None of the NYA signatories are legally bound to uphold their word. There is no contract, merely statements. When these people see massive losses on the books for what they are attempting, the majority will back out.
Im happy to make a bet here. My bet is that the legacy bitcoin chain will survive *regardless of any conditions mentioned above*. If B2X gets 95% or 85% or less or more, I don't care. Im saying that no matter what the circumstances are, that when the dust settles we will have the legacy bitcoin chain actively mined with 10 minute blocks *after the difficulty adjustment*.
You seem to think that the legacy chain wont make it to the difficulty adjustment. Im saying it will. If thats what you would like to bet on, then we should bet on that and disperse of any complex terms.
I would rather see us bet on the equivalent of 1 ETH worth of BTC instead of 1 ETH, because I do not see the point in purchasing ETH for this bet. But if you insist on this I would be willing to make the exception. I believe both BTC and ETH have their own separate use cases and valuations and both will weather this storm.

Its also the fastest path to introduce attack vectors on Linear scaling of sighash operations.
Why do you persist in ignoring well established and documented attack vectors on bitcoin to recklessly advocate for something that will make bitcoin vulnerable. Its almost like you have a ulterior motive here....


Bitcoin is a protocol, and protocols are defined and participated in. they are voluntary and not voted on. People can build a new protocol, but can not force people into it. regardless of what people vote for.
First, users absolutely can vote for a change (wtf do you think UASF is?), second what you wrote does not take away from the point and you know it, so why are you running down a rabbit hole of tangents? Bitcoin being hard to change is a feature, not a bug. It does not matter whether it is or is not a democracy (its not, and I wasn't claiming it was), and the point still stands. You are merely erecting a strawman to take punches at because you cannot address the point.
This is typical deflection tactics from someone with inferior intellect on the subject.


Unless you are living in an alternative reality (you are judging by your perception) you cannot sit here and try to argue bitcoin is no longer working great.
It works exactly as it did 5 years ago. You paid the right fee then and you got confirmed, you pay the right fee now, you get confirmed. I understand it *costs more* to get your transaction confirmed, but you are taking a infantile stance to make the assertion that as bitcoin grows it should continue to be free.
As bitcoin expands its resource requirements do. Maybe hardware does have some moore's law slope and costs will keep up with the curve but that ignores the fact that *you have to buy new hardware to keep parity*.
You are basically saying that the maintainers of the network (node operators) should absorb the cost of operating the network so that you can *temporarily* buy your coffee on-chain.
Why temporarily? Because the moment you open up blockspace there will be a thousand businesses willing to inject whatever shit their entrepreneurial minds think of onto the blockchain as a service for a low cost.
So by opening up the blockspace you are merely kicking the can down the road for a very, *very* short period of time all so that you can enjoy a small decrease of fee's?
How fucking selfish and retarded.
Real engineers fix the problem with long term solutions. Since a unbounded blockspace on the main chain would absolutely centralize bitcoin and be the destruction of its value proposition you cannot pretend that there is some sort of half way safe point.
You also cannot pretend that SW *already accomplishes that by raising the blocksize* and with combination with LN will eliminate all of this stupid FUD you are throwing around.
Im tired of pointing out the obvious to you. You are so entrenched that no matter how many times you are told the facts you continue to spew shit over everyone here.

At the time of publishing that research block size was at half a megabyte roughly on average. All it's saying right there is that they averaged the blocks and then extrapolated data based on that average. They then created models based on that average and then increased transaction count and block size to come to their conclusions.

You are thinking like a American. You need to think like a African. What is "cheap" to you is a months salary to the places in the world where we need bitcoin to replace monetary systems.
If bitcoin cannot scale and remain decentralized then its fundamental value offerings are non-existent.


I dont know and dont really care. Commercial support while great offers little to the network. These are chokepoints, easy places to attack. If you want to take down a system that relies upon commercial centers then its relatively easy and cheap to attack the network. This is not the case if the network is distributed across residential connections around the world.
Bitcoin must remain anti-fragile or its worthless.
There is one piece of technology that I think could change the way we look at node count, decentralization, etc, but this technology is brand new, unreleased (or commercial only at this point) and **very** expensive.
Maybe in 10 years when this technology is consumer tech and there is competition in the market then we can discuss the topic from a different perspective. But for now, we live in the world we live in and computers have not changed all that much in 2 years. But the requirements for bitcoin to scale on-chain are enormous. People always assume that resources scale linearly, that if you make the blocksize 1mb to 2mb that you only need double the resources. This is not true. When you understand how the resources actually scale (exponentially) then you can understand why such small changes have such large effects upon decentralization.

I agree with most of what you said but not this. There is some abnormal low IQ over there. Everything is a conspiracy.
Im sorry, but when conspiracy theories are 90% of your content that means the place is filled with low IQ individuals.
I would be willing to compromise on a blocksize increase if there was protections put in place on legacy style blocks to deal with the linear sigops issue and there was framework in place with spoonnet to safely fork over, but ONLY if there are strict parameters put in place to measure economic activity up to a specific date, and if the activity does not warrant a increase then that increase should be put off until those parameters are met fairly.
The problem here is miners can game the system to inflate numbers to reach those parameters quicker.

Should we all run the same bittorrent client? Should we all run the same operating sytem?
Giving central power to a set of developers presents attack vectors that can only exist if there is one individual group in control.
Im not saying dont support core, they are clearly the most professional and talented, but im saying that we should not stigmatize supporting another client so long as that client is not trying to change the protocol.  For those who do want to change the protocol, well, good luck to them. I dont see it as a terrible thing because its not healthy for any individual group to feel that they have complete control over something.
We cannot expect miners to be altruistic, so why should we expect the same of our developers? We must stay constantly vigilant for attacks so that we can keep bitcoin anti-fragile.

I cannot tell if this is sarcasm or not? Obviously they are a large player in the space, but its always important to remember that blockstream is only perceived as a super large institution because of the amount of social attention that is inappropriately directed towards it.
When you look at how many developers are contributing to the bitcoin repo, and then how many of those are [blockstream employee's]( you see the real picture.
Blockstream represents a fairly small portion of contributors. So it is totally within reason to expect them to also have a smaller contribution of commits compared to the rest.
We all know they have pulled their share and will continue to do so. But I think we should also appreciate the fact that they do not have a inordinate amount of control over the repo and this demonstrates that.

No. The lesson learned here is "Dont rely upon specialized interest groups who have economic incentives to fight your upgrades"
The solution is to take it out of the hands of miners, where it never was in the first place. Rusty gave them unintentional power over upgrades thinking it was a good idea. Obviously it it was a bad idea in hindsight. Lesson learned and going forward we wont deal with this anymore, hence BIP8 style UASF's from now on.
You seem to be in the "miners rule the world" camp which only shows you dont understand the economics behind bitcoins network. Miners follow the money and the money is created by the users. If the users upgrade then the miners *must* upgrade to get their money. This is bitcoin101.

You purchase bitcoin to invest into bitcoin. Every shitcoin out there uses "blockchain technology" and you dont buy bitcoins because you believe shitcoins will hold value.
And if the value is not tied to the infrastructure of the blockchain, then why is it that the market bottomed out coincidentally right where the *cost of mining a bitcoin* was? To me that will always be a direct correlation that the price of bitcoin is tied to the infrastructural cost of bitcoin. 
Sure, it can always go higher, but it cannot go lower [than the cost of mining a bitcoin with current cutting edge technology] without negative effects. So I would argue that is correlative evidence that it is indeed tied to the cost of the infrastructure.


And QuadrigaCX can go the same route. Incredibly risky investing into a bitcoin company who could at any time "get hacked" and shut down operations.

A segwit transaction would be valid on a non-segwit legacy chain? AFAIK, a SW tx would be invisible to the legacy chain and only visible to a BIP148 node enforcing chain. So the tx would be seen (assuming you moved to a SW address) on the BIP148 side but **not** by the other side. If you try to send to a legacy address through your BIP148 wallet then I dont think this would work as it would be picked up by non-BIP148 nodes and included in either block.
Then you do the same on a non-BIP148 wallet BIP148 nodes will ignore the tx if it is not mined with a block signaling nVersion header top 3 bits to 001 together with bit field (1&lt;&lt;1) (according to the existing segwit deployment). Blocks that do not signal as required will be rejected by BIP148 nodes, so it would not make it onto their chain.
So your tx will be propagated by the nodes that support your BIP and included by miners that support your BIP. Those that do not support it wont see it (or will reject) so it wont be included in their block.
It makes sense in my head working through the details, but perhaps im missing something?

A company that literally has a legal contract that puts bitcoin's best interests ahead of their own. In writing.

Anyone who criticizes Blockstream is either new to bitcoin, or is a *utter fucking retard*. If you dont know the history behind the Cypherpunks, and their history behind Blockstream, then you must be new to bitcoin. So im not going to assume you are the latter.

It depends on communication, and frankly, politics. It also depends on how hardcore the community wants to see SW adopted. You would be surprised at the wildfire of support for a small technical patch that can be achieved if enough hardcore base supports it.
For example, if just a measly 10% of the pro-core community starts advocating for this patch to be run, then there is actually a chance it will happen.
[Here is the proof behind that theory](


Since we actually have a much larger hardcore userbase that feels this way, I think its very likely that this would be the reaction to the minority group attempting to veto the rule change.

This is where routing comes in. You wont need to have a channel open with each person/company so long as there is a path to them through the network.


Yea, LN. Obviously =)


The transactions you do on LN are stored on LN nodes, not the blockchain. You  just need to first open a channel, and then eventually settle. This will reduce on-blockchain load by orders of magnitude.
The only exception being that LN enables so much business that whatever space savings occur are immediately taken up by new business. Which would be the best kind of problem to have.


Right, but its locked up in the blockchain and you have the keys. So your money is as safe as it is sitting in your wallet waiting for your privkeys to unlock it. So there's only a very small technical difference, definitely not enough to argue over.
Also, this does not consider the fact that once LN is operational, all services will have LN wallets so any payments that you would normally make through the bitcoin blockchain will be possible through LN. I understand this is speculation, but if this were not going to be the case, then LN would be pointless. I dont think that it will be pointless ;)

Then you are simply unaware of the current limitations of bitcoin, and the massive expansion of capabilities that these upgrades and new networks brings.
With education comes awareness comes comprehension. These are not simple subjects, it took me months to wrap my head around the basics of bitcoin when I first heard about it, and its taken me years to fully understand the vitality of decentralization. LN is a decentralized scaling solution that has few limitations, and that in itself is worth a trillion dollar market cap.
Remember, we've not been able to scale too many decentralized networks to a global system. It takes some enormous bootstrapping. We mostly just hack together centralized solutions because they are faster, though less secure.
But to have something that is both secure and maximizes bandwidth? That's incredible.

I feel this argument is disingenuous. The only reason its not on the same scale is because prior to civilized society we did not have the means to scale our population to the billions they are today.
If we could somehow do that, without government, then yes, I believe we would have it *on a much larger scale*. With the modern era of drones, missle strikes etc, human casualty is actually at a all time low in terms of war.

I think it is important to realize that facebook is marginalizing the transaction cost overhead with its profits in other area's. They are not reinventing the wheel or trying something new, they are simply absorbing the costs and betting their platform will continue to thrive.


Reality check here: Facebook will not be a goliath forever, just like myspace was not. And that means when their platform looses market share to competitors in the market, and when their bottom line falls out, then they will *have* to start charging for these transaction fee's or they will go negative. 
This is a very non-permanent payment solution and clearly bitcoin is still a million times better. Regarding *ease of use* bitcoin is in early stages, the UI's are being developed and applications are intergrating. Give it a few years and bitcoin *will* be embedded in all these standard applications meaning you will be able to send money back in forth between anyone *anywhere* (not just US) instantly with just micro-tx fee's and you do not have to worry about big brother's 'fraud alert' team *monitoring* your transactions.

Only because you can't see the tree's for the forest. A more efficient liquid fluid frictionless trustless blockchain means unlimited use cases and exponential adoption, which means a much higher pricepoint 
(SW + LN). Making this same logic you just doubted correct by your own example. I've made this argument a thousand times.
Right now alt's like ETH are taking use cases that **should** be done on bitcoin and lightning network, but cannot because we are at a impasse due to a minority mining cartel that has stalled progress so that they can continue to monopolize PoW through their covert asicboost.
If we can establish control of the network and enable these upgrades, then the price will go **much** higher, and miners will make much more.
The problem is the upgrade blocks covert asicboost, so it works against this mining cartels best economic interest, hence why they have vetoed the upgrade.
Once we fix this, then they have no reason to further stall progress. 
Its a win-win-win every way you think about it.

[No, it absolutely cannot.](


You are sorely lacking education on the topic if you think PoS can exist without PoW. Why do you think that Ethereum has had so many issues implementing PoS? Their attempt at doing full PoS (2015) miserably failed and  they have kept PoW in (2018)because vitalik fully understands now that you **cannot** have a functional PoS *without some form of PoW implemented*.
PoS is *not* a magical bullet and never will be. Its trade-off's have only proven to lower the security of the network for some resource management.
If you want lower security then why don't you continue using paypal and fiat? The entire reason crypto was invented was to enable financial sovereignty. 
You cannot have financial sovereignty with a low-security PoS system.

First, I prefer this site because it has a really nice organization scheme -
I did not mean to imply that satoshi never engaged in game theory to attempt to solve issues.
In regards to "preventing tx fee's from being gamed" ...you'll have to show me a quote specifically. At the top of my head, I cannot think of him discussing that topic narrowly.
He does talk a lot about miners and security. He discusses game theory about block economics a *lot*. To sum up my general knowledge on his writings on this subject, I believe his general point was -
"Miners wont do anything stupid to hurt the network because it would be against their best interests"
Clearly this is wrong. In bitcoin of 2016/2017/2018, with covert asicboost and spam attacks, there are scenario's in which miners can benefit from *hurting* the system. To understand how it hurts the system you must understand the cause and effect of miners actions in the context of this discussion. Redistribution of some wealth from bitcoin users to miners is OK under normal circumstances, they are doing a job and they should be paid.....but when fee's are $50 due to spam attacks, thats like paying your food delivery guy a $50 tip instead of $3...its rape. No one likes that, I don't believe anyone can rationally say thats a good thing.
And covert AB increases monopolies, something we already have a serious problem with. Fortunately Halong came to the rescue, bringing in some fresh competition and balancing the game a little bit.
This particular discussion is not something I've seen satoshi discuss before, obviously because it came up long after he left. I've actually never seen him talk about stuffing transactions to game the fee.
I don't know why he would, he actually thought that bitcoin would remain relatively cheap for a very long time. So it doesn't make sense that he would be thinking this way when his quotes on the record show that he thought differently about how the way fee's would pan out.


If you hire a maid to clean your house, and she does a *really fucking good job*, but then steals your watch, are you supposed to be happy about the job she did cleaning?
I cannot ignore that while these miners are profiting from securing the network, that they are doing it in a way that maximizes the cost to the end user and revenue on their end.
Again, I see this as a problem with bitcoins design. Bitcoin *cannot* rely upon altruism in order to survive. If we cannot fix this problem, bitcoin might always be a very expensive network to use. This may not be as big a issue as we think it is, if it turns out that bitcoins biggest feature is wealth protection. It wont matter if it costs $1 or $5 or even $50 per transaction if it means securing wealth from corrupt nations. What does a $50 transaction matter when you are having $1000 stolen from you a month from a corrupt government inflating your currency?
And with LN, at least you'll only have to pay this fee once. Then you can frictionlessly spend your btc on LN without needing to pay mining cartels ridiculously gamed fee's.

His point is simple, yet it is valid. Yes, they can freeze your bank accounts, civil asset forfeiture, etc. But bitcoin is *digital cash* and in order to seize your cash they would need warrants and a physical endeavor to do so.

Reading this I had a grandoise vision of bigger things. We know that banks are involved in the worlds largest money laundering schemes.
This will naturally transition to cryptocurrencies, which are much more fluid in their transferability, making them prime assets for money laundering.
Banks with ulterior purposes, like HSBC, VTB, Alfa, etc,  are going to embrace crypto so that it legitimizes their laundering into the traditional financial world.
I think this is why we are seeing banks like RaboBank launching their own wallets.
The more they can mix regular customers crypto with their illicit crypto, the easier it is for them to launder.
I think that specialized interest powers will embrace crypto ultimately for this reason. There is so much goddamn money they cannot refuse. Greed will always dictate the action of businesses.

Yeah? Well how was that positive contribution to society working out when he was scamming investors for a [quantum computer that he admitted was mathematically infeasible?](
When you judge people you have to judge them based on their actions and not just their words and vitalik has a past history of shady actions. This is not to say that I'm not glad that he's working on ethereum he seems like an incredibly bright young guy and I'm glad that he's funneling his personal labor into something that is not scammy, and open source. Even though the ethereum ICO was kind of scammy.
Vitalik has a issue with over expressing his confidence. One can reasonably argue that this emotional exuberance is beneficial because it allows him to hyper-focus on his projects. Maybe he really thought his pseudo quantum computer could be a reality and he wasn't purposely defrauding investors but one cannot argue that he didn't take money for something that was mathematically impossible, intentions aside.
The reason I'm telling you this is to caution your over bounding confidence of the guy. He's good but he's not as good as you think he is. I don't dislike him but I'm not sucking his dick either.

In a round-a-bout way this may true, but I would think a more accurate statement would be that bitcoin is backed by its PoW system (miners). I understand they are rewarded in bitcoin, but that is one step further and obscures the real truth when making a black and white statement like that.  
(from article):


Anyone else reading this the way I am? It seems like coindesk is anti-bitcoin in this statement. Almost like they are suggesting that these 'more advanced blockchains' are superior to bitcoin.
How are these blockchains 'more advanced' ? I would think that the two defining aspects of 'superiority' when it comes to blockchains would be its hashing power and its proof of work system (PoS, PoW, etc) and I've not seen any proposals so far that are better that PoW, which would mean that bitcoin's blockchain has both the superior hashrate (by orders of magnitudes) and the best PoW system.
What is really up for date is how these companies plan to secure their 'blockchains' and how resiliant they will be against attackers once they try to emulate the blockchain without securing it. That is, assuming it *is* a blockchain and not just a database. Good luck with that, have fun putting a pony in front of a porsche and gutting the engine.

They were different times then, different needs, resource availability, etc. Yes, it become bloated and spammy over time....but so did the blockchain?  That's what happens with narrow resources when they get too big. That's why I criticized him for not pivoting faster. It was ok then, but not **now**.
I may be harsh on for his decisions leading up to S2X, but I'm not a witch Hunter and I don't see any fault of his prior to that experience. He ran a business and while we shouldn't kneel to him for taking advantage of his free will to make money, we should recognize that such actions are necessary to build, experiment and improve the ecosystem.

These are complex systems who's trade-offs I cannot claim to fully understand to the point of positively predicting outcomes.
But this particular quote does not feel fully honest....


Right now there is extremely cheap coal power in lowly regulated countries. No one can deny that there is an abundance of Chinese farms running on coal based power. So why hasn't this philosophy applied to them?  If there is cheaper power, why are they still using coal? If the price continues to accelerate, then this gives even less reason to move. So the price and supply greatly influences the decisions of miners and cannot be ignored.
If the price will sustain high margins, there will always be those willing to make less and not move the farm to a hydropower area.
This is something that should be discussed and not ignored. Bitcoin, as awesome as it is, is turning into quite the little heat generator for the planet and that topic effects the entire population.

I have conflicting thoughts on this issue. I see this as one of the bigger instabilities of bitcoins premise in regards to replacing national currencies.
As much as I hate taxes I admit that they are essential for a society to *function well*. I know im going to get a bunch of batshit crazy libertarians down my throat about that, but I dont really care what these crazy people think.
I know that things like NASA, NIH, EPA, Fire Fighters, Police, Sewage, Transportation are all thanks to enforced tax policies.
Humans are by nature self preserving and if we allow them to decide to pay then we will not be able to have all of these nice things that make society wonderful. There are plenty of examples in human history of what happens to countries that adopt the "we dont need to enforce taxes" mentality. They all failed.
Im a *huge* advocate of tax reform and disagree with the way tax money is spent, but taxes *are absolutely essential to a healthy society* and anyone who thinks otherwise is living in a koolaid fantasy.
Bitcoin presents a problem because there can be no enforced taxation. Yes, this is great for individual liberty, until society starts to crumble because we cannot pay for the trains, the roads, the police, the firefighters, reseach, health, etc. Then how good is that individual liberty?
Like all things in life, there is a healthy balance. If we had less of a parasitic bureaucracy we would be able to balance spending better. If we outlawed lobbying we would spend on things that benefit the public instead of milk us dry for specialized interests profits.

Confirmed FUD patrol.
Nice job ignoring the fact that its getting activated on all these other crypto's which are skyrocketing in value and that 95% of the entire bitcoin industry has already adopted SW, but sure sure, lets ignore all facts so that it fits in your narrow delusional mirror image of reality.
You are stupid if you think a single mining cabal can hold bitcoin hostage forever. 
Let me guess, you think Bitmain is a totally nice entity within the bitcoin space and has no malicious behavior and are merely benevolent actors?
BIP148 may not activate, but BIP149 sure as hell will. You cannot avoid a flag day activation. You are going to have to convince 98% of the community to stop running Core nodes. I dont think you understand how bitcoin works.

Except, that they don't have to listen/enact our commentary. They are going to force their draconian legislation down our throats because of 'terrorism' and 'for the safety of all' so that they can 'get a handle on this bitcoin thing'.
Except they wont get a handle on it. They will not succeed. Oh sure, they will pass legislation and enact rules/regulations, but in the end they will find that we can bypass their system too easy by using other non-regulated parties. All its going to do is stifle innovation in new york and cause other states to look at their rules and possibly attempt to enact similar measures.
But there will be states that will wait it out, see their failure, or purposefully try to go the other way to be innovative and bring the business to them.
In the end, it will all balance out, just like the network balances out. Im not worried about the long term. The short term is going to be rocky no matter how hard we rally.

Are you really going to stipulate that a backwards compatible soft fork is "just as risky" as a HF?
That does not make very much sense. There's zero risk of a flag day UASF for SW because it will not disrupt anything. Miners and nodes who don't upgrade will continue to operate on the network regardless of the added rules. Those who wish to enjoy the new benefits can, and those who dont, wont.


Why are you still peddling this HK nonsense talk? Why do people persist in beating a horse that is not only dead, but its bones have literally rotted into dust and nothing exists anymore.
There is no HK agreement. It was broken within a few weeks of it being made by miners signaling BitcoinXT. Get over it dude, its not going to happen and you insisting that it does only shows how irrationally stubborn you are.
Core does not deal with terrorists. If you want a blocksize upgrade then you should petition all your fellow big blockers to active the pending upgrade that grants us exactly what you are asking for.
But no, you want 2mb non-witness, *for no fucking reason whatsoever other than stupid pride*. Why do you persist in ignoring the fact that SW optimizes blockspace resources? Why do you persist in ignoring the fact that upgrading to 2mb non witness will open up the network to cpu ddos attacks?
You are advocating for a hardfork claiming its "just as risky" as a backwards compatible softfork, which is nonsense. You are advocating for upgrading the system in a way that opens it up to new attack vectors, which is reckless.
You've been told this a million times and yet here you are, still advocating for reckless behavior. One can only assume after this long that your plan is to hurt bitcoin as much as possible...

We are just starting to see the first cold clutches of negative interest rates. Time is running out for monetary policy mechanisms to exert control to kick the can down the road.
When we go into the negative, then the can will be approaching very fast. The economy is a slow lumbering beast thats been operating at zero interest rates for some time now, and its difficult to see the bigger picture, but now that negative interest rates are being played with, we can see the progression and where its heading.
Bitcoin will have many years to flourish.

Spending hours of each day invested intellectually and socially into this experiment we call bitcoin and trying to educate as many people here on the facts. Considering that I am one of the most active users on here you cannot rightly accuse me of apathy. I also have communities that I have built and encouraged dozens of friends to buy into this thing we call bitcoin. I've done more than my fair part as an individual in this ecosystem.
Also, deflecting my point by cherry picking part of my quote to respond to does not take away my point. Barry could have advocated for the sound path forward 1.5 years ago way, way, **way** before we started to have anything like what we are experiencing now, which would have completely removed what we are experiencing now. 
He could have chose to be a leader in the social space of progressing bitcoin forward, instead he's late to the party and advocating something that all of the rational engineers on the topic have stated is not the right path forward.
Thats not helping. Thats called throwing gas on the fire.
Barry may have done a lot economically as a venture capitalist / investment company, but he's failed miserably coming in this late to the game and advocating for non-starter "compromise". Lets not forget **the only reason we are in this position is because chinese mining conglomerates are creating it by obstructing the fix**.
We do not need a blocksize increase since SW is already a BS increase. Are we seriously pandering to the ego's of chinese miners? If thats the case, bitcoin has failed.
Fuck that, and fuck barry's opinion and fuck yours too if thats what you think should be done. Bitcoin was not created to pander to specialize interest groups ego's. Sorry eric, thats a load of shit.

- - - I really think an official statement is needed on the issue. I think that this is clearly an attempt by industry to hijack grassroots user movements to force us on a different path than what is optimal.
So I think the "next best situation" right now is for Core dev's to put together a "If we were to do this, this is how we would do it" plan, and to propose it as a single unified voice of consensus on the issue. I understand how difficult that may be, but now time is of the essence so you guys really need to brainstorm and come up with a reasonable implementation. If there is to be a HF, then there must be HF wishlist items added!
I do not want to see industry leaders hijack the bitcoin development process.

All this talk of new entrants and shaking people out makes me just shake my head. The amount of new investors is slow and trickling, and we know this because we can look at trade volume and analyze movements.
People who say "price manipulation" are right and wrong. The price is not manipulated, there are simply actors and some actors win and others lose. Its a game of gambling and people are going to go the direction that they think others are going to go. Its a very technical sheep gamblers game where you want to absorb gains through others losses in attempts to cause margin calls to accelerate your profits. Its like trying to be a wizard sheep, to know what the other sheep are going to do before the majority do it, so you can profit the most on the action. You got to get to the nice patches of grass reasonably first to get your food, but you dont stray too far away from the safety of others.
I feel whether bitcoin goes up or goes down, its mostly the same people pushing it down, or up. When its going down, its the whales shorting, and when its going up, its the whales closing their shorts or buying in expectation of rises, soon to be followed by the dump. Up down up down up down....its just free market movement.
Regarding banks and price manipulation, think on it for a second. So, some bank or mega payment network company throws a ton of $$ (100's of millions) at shorting bitcoin, trying to cause its doom. Then what?
The price would eventually find a equilibrium. For however much money 'X' tries to drive it down, participants will buy up the cheap coins. Whales who were shorting would close their shorts to cover. And, even if they brought it down to a penny, they would eventually have to stop, and the market would rebound. Rebound it would, slowly but surely, and in a few years or less we would be right back to where we are now. They cannot stop the network, only loose a *lot* of money in the process on something they are not sure they can ever fully stop.

Are you involved in etherum? Im curious how you extrapolate such insider knowledge from 2 systems, one that you can possibly know nothing about. Hard to catch up? They are launching in 6-9 months. They are pretty much on the same pace. Ethereum has been vaporware for a couple years, and rootstock has been being built quietly for 2 years. There's very little difference.
As for your opinion on the project, I think you are being very unrealistic. It seems to me that it is *you* who is desperately holding to this idea that etherum is going to be 'king of the castle'.
The entire premise of your opinion is defeated by one simple fact: Bitcoin is orders of magnitude larger and more secure than etherum. Ethereum could run for the next 5 years and it would still in no way compete with the hashing power that bitcoin has generated. While rootstock gets to jump right into the network with merged mining. I think it will not just take off, it will *fly* forward way past etherum. Also consider that it will be compatible with etherum contracts and you have a no brainer as to which system you would trust more.

They absolutely will *not* be able to release a piece of their copyright work safely without someone ripping it and sharing it.

Do not mix up deflationary economies with deflationary currencies.
One does not apply the same as the other.
All of these general wisdoms you speak about are general theory as they apply to economies. They do not always hold the same rules for currencies. 
The most broad example of a deflationary market that has existed for 40+ years now is the technology sector. Technology is better 3 months from now every moment. So why would we spend our money if our money can buy something nicer in 3 months?
Yet, we do. Every single time.
Your entire theory is confounded when you take this into account. How can you reasonably claim to me that bitcoin will not be the same? Sound money will be both an  investment (as in, wont suffer monetary extraction through inflation) and a good utility of transfer of wealth. Thats why I like bitcoin.

For some context, we need bitcoin to be $1M per btc in order for 1 satoshi to be worth 1 cent.
So even if bitcoin was worth 1 million dollars today, and there was a perfect storm scenario where rounding made you loose the maximum amount of 0.999 satoshi, you would have only had lost .999 of 1 cent.
At the current price of $6736 that satoshi is worth $0.00006736 (that is 6/1000th of a penny, meaning this would need to happen 166 times in order for you to lose 1 cent )

I both agree and disagree. This is not about facts or technicals, but identity politics. Those who are entrenched in a specific policy do not respond to information, and in fact might even dig in deeper and double down on their entrenchment in a backfire effect [because we provide them information](
Getting people to move the needle on falsely held beliefs is not about supplying them with facts, but by either converting or discrediting the "trusted individuals" within their identity group.
Gavin is such one of those individuals. Jeff Garzik, Jihan Wu, Roger Ver, are all examples of "trusted nodes" within that particular identity group of minority vocal actors.
When a trusted individual who has power within the space makes false statements or attacks others, then it is **really really important** that we discredit their falsehoods and accusations.
I've written extensively about gavin in positive ways. I like Gavins character (which has been diminished since I found out about this story) and have nothing against Gavin as a human. Gavin as a person i want to be the coach of my kids baseball game.
What you are confusing here is Gavin the baseball coach and Gavin the former bitcoin repo "benevolent dictator".
You are assuming that because I am correcting falsehoods, conspiracy theories and attacks perpetuated by gavin that I am somehow attacking *Gavin the Baseball coach*. **That is simply untrue**.
Im attacking Gavin the trusted node within a identity politics group who has been engaging in a political war in the bitcoin space.
Thats *not personal* and you should learn to distinguish between the two. Im not attacking Gavin, im attacking Gavin's actions. The difference between a personal attack and a non-personal attack is *whether you are attacking that person*. Attacking their actions is not a character attack! How about instead of worrying about everyones delicate sensitivities that we instead accept the fact that bitcoin is under attack and we respond to those attacks to deneutralize them?

All of this was written from a perspective of someone who has not spent the last few years investigating the data. Your perspective is narrow. You are engaging in a false dichotomy where you do not even know the middle ground, let alone have you investigated it. These things you are trying to simplify?
Cannot be simplified.
The fact that you have attempted to do so is proof of lack of greater knowledge.
EDIT - While is mostly wrong, one criticism of his that was valid was that I did not attempt to explain the illogical stance of the above post. The reason I did not was because I was under the covers with my girl just jumping in bed and it was past both our bedtimes. I really did not have time to write out a more informative response. So here you.


If that were the case, then BU would currently retain the majority of hashing power. Since it contains a flyspec of the hashing power, what you've just said is demonstrably false.


False Dichotomy.  This is not a simple problem and there is no simple fix. If you really think that then you are in no position to be telling others what is and what is not. First and foremost, *no decisions should ever be made through politics*. The developers must make engineering decisions based on the merits of tradeoffs.
There are tradeoff's for both big blocks and small blocks. The positive tradeoffs for small blocks is a well tested and mature fee market, something that is absolutely essential to *bitcoins long term growth*. Keeping the network *as decentralized as possible*, which is to say, to stem the flow of centralization. Bitcoin is worthless if it becomes centralized to the point that it loses its fundamental value, fungibility. You cannot be fungible if there is censorship. The negative tradeoff is that a restricted blockspace has the potential to harm the growth of micro-transaction economies. Which by the way, dont really exist? Most microtx services are off-chain.
So what do we lose right now for 1MB blocks? Well for one, fee's. We pay more for transactions. Before blocks were full, a tx was about 3-5 cents, now its 9-12 cents. While I absolutely am an advocate for not restricting poor people from using the blockchain, its important to remember that the blockchain is absolutely worthless and no one will be able to use it should we drop node counts significantly to the point that centralization occurs. People can use a variety of providers at this very moment to send very very small amounts of bitcoins to other people. So its not like people cant do this right now with blocks full?
News flash - blocks have been full for a while now. The sky didn't fall. Nothing bad happened. The big bad wolf never appeared.
But you know what is going to appear? 2nd layered services that allow for everything and beyond our wildest dreams to all occur without impacting the decentralization of the network.
That is assuming that we don't get a large enough faction to be naive enough to block something that would enable bitcoin to grow to its full potential. 
So the heart of the issue - Why dont we just raise it to 2mb? Add some relief right?
Well that solves nothing. It does not enable bitcoin to scale. It will offer fee relief yes, but can anyone demonstrate empirically that the current fee structure has prevented bitcoins growth in a substantial way? People think that bitcoin can scale with bigger blocks, and while that has some ring of truth to it it is also ignoring the externalities. In order for bitcoin to truly scale on-chain as it stands, we would need massive blocks. Is that really the road you wish to go down? Because going down that road results in "server farms with one WAN facing connected node relaying tx's to the LAN based nodes" ....which is a satoshi thought that screams "wrong wrong wrong". You cannot be anti-fragile with such a setup, the network is easily compromised!
Now, there *are* technologies in the works that will help with on-chain scaling *in the future*. But the future is not now. PBFT-based signing is one such thing. Development of schnorr signatures will greatly help with reducing bloat. MimbleWimble is a incredibly exciting development.
But you want to just raise the blocksize to alleviate ....what problem ? I dont really see any problems with bitcoin right now. We are operating with full blocks and everythings fine?
Soon these discussions will be history. We will have massive relief in the forms of LN, Tumblebit, MimWim all made possible *THANKS TO SEGWIT*.
Thats the absurdity of this entire discussion. Segwit is the enabler of all of these full-decentralized scaling technologies. And people really want to block THAT? Are they just that stupid, or are they state-sponsored actors who are trying to attack bitcoin?

Bitcoin belongs in the hands of the most talented and incorruptible engineers who have the best proven track record.
You do realize when you say "Blockstream" that you are referring to Adam Back, one of the original Cyperpunks, cited in the bitcoin whitepaper and also in the TOR whitepaper?

@_date: 2017-05-29 17:34:42


I could be wrong (please correct me if I am), but I would assume loading your private key into a wallet that supports BIP148 (their backend node is BIP148) and sending your coins to an address you just generated within that BIP148 wallet. Then you should have coins on that side of the chain, assuming there has already been a split. If there has not, then you obviously cannot do this yet.
The reverse applies for moving non-BIP148 coins, which we really should just refer to them as SW-BTC coins as thats what they are at that point.

Yes, its interesting to speculate the who's and why's. But no one really knows. Except for whats his name on bitcointalk who publicly declared he was conducting spam attacks approx 2 years ago.
Which was cool that he admitted it. At least we knew the agenda. Which was good, because it was basically like "Fuck it, if I can attack it I will, you better fix it". I think thats a very effective way to get shit done. Most of the time disclosing vulnerabilities to companies does nothing, its not until you tell them you are going to go public, then do, that they get fixed.

I think we need to correct the headline of the title. Instead of reading:


I propose we amend it to:


Clearly Mark Gilbert does not understand the decentralized *censorship proof* aspect of bitcoin. How exactly are banks/governments going to "drag the digital platforms into existing oversight frameworks" ? How successful was the MPAA lobbying 100's of millions of dollars in *dragging the torrent platforms into the MPAA oversight frameworks* ?
Why can these people not understand that bitcoin the honey badger does *give two flying fucks* about &lt;insert bank or governments regulation here&gt; ? It will continue work as it was intended to work, and there's not a goddamn thing anyone can do to do to stop it. Halt progress on price accumlation? Sure. Scare investors? Sure. Smother business opportunities? Yup, that too. But *they cannot stop it*, and *they cannot force it into infastructure*. Bitcoin will always be able to be used outside any proposed infrastructure and there's no way to put the genie back in the bottle.

Yes, and in our 'democratic' nation, we get to choose to vote or not vote. Just like you get to choose to participate in the network or not participate in the network. You can run a node enforcing your own rules, or you can mine enforcing your own rules.
Just like you can vote for whatever candidate you please (write in ballot), or you can vote for the major competitors (bitcoin core vs bitcoinXT)
Im failing to see the difference, and even if there was a difference we are discussing *semantics* at this interval and going into the abstract. It seems clear to me that any system by which the people get to vote on the rules, by ballot, vote casting, etc, and in which the majority system wins, is *exactly a democracy* and bitcoin is exactly that.
i've updated my OP with the definition and points. Enjoy.

Im a little confused on what it can *be used for*. Are they really discussing mining on a cell phone? I hope they are just using it as a theoretical example and not as a real use case.

I really want to understand this part better. I still dont understand how the LN node operators incentive structure works, and how its going to integrate with current POW mining. My fear is that this will somehow take away from the hashing power/security of the main network, by replacing the incentive structure.
If LN changes the fee structure greatly, then could it be a potential risk to the overall network security?

What has he **given back** to the ecosystem that he has taken so much profit from?

Of a particular bubble. Each bubble will have its own duration dependant upon market conditions.


What a absurd statement. I made no such claim. We are talking about **this particular bubble** phase, not the "life cycle of bitcoin". 
If you dont think any one of these phases can be in a short number of days then you dont know what you are talking about. Fear and capitulation as well as delusion and greed can absolutely be single digits of days in that particular cycle.
Look at this graph and move out to 4H
In this very specific 2017 bubble the "take off" started jan-march. The first bear trap was 2 weeks ago in May.
We peaked at 2800 "new paradigm" and now we are on the backside.
If you want to argue that we've not yet Return to "Normal" and we are still in "denial" phase, then I might agree to that. Thats very possible.
But thinking we've not already reached the peak of **this** bubble is delusion. The charts are right in front of your face. You can see the peak and you can see we are already on the backside. This isn't speculation, this is data infront of your face you cannot deny.

If enough miners with enough economic incentive collude, with the state of affairs as it is today with only a few centralized block explorers, exchanges, etc, I do not think its unreasonable for those to be able to collude and get their rule restricted transactions broadcasted and accepted to "economic nodes" (aka exchange, block explorer, wallet providers, etc)
That is assuming, the rule does not have a negative economic impact on the community, or that there is enough propaganda to push the issue through.

That variance is not even enough to be confirmed in the next block as opposed to the block you calculated your fee for. New users get burned because they dont know how to calculate fee's and thats the *only* reason they get burned.

So kind of you to tell me what my viewpoints are. Tell me, do you make much money predicting the future and reading the thoughts of others? You're not very good at it.
The only thing I am seeking to exclude is the unlawful breech of people's personal lives by the state. The 4th amendment (US of course) gives me the right to privacy in my own home. Recent federal rulings have extended these rights to my cell phone, which contains all my personal life. Transactions conducted on my phone, in my home, for legal products delivered to my home is *not* to be viewed, shared, analyzed or (insert whatever here) by anyone *other than myself or anyone I authorize*.
I also do not wish to see a system that is invented, designed, built and ran by the people taken over by the state and over-regulated to cater to crony capitalism. This system was built to bypass all that bullshit and to offer freedom. Allowing agencies to poison it by changing the rules due to political pressure does not fly in my book. This is a global technology and these agencies dont have a say in *our* ruleset. Its good to enforce this agenda in the hearts and minds of all so that we stand up to the encroachment against our liberties. Things get poisoned over time if you dont stand strong, and that is what I am advocating.

First, why claim to be satoshi, but when it comes to proving that you *actually are* satoshi you do it in a suspicious manner? If you are intending to prove what you claim, the you should do it in a clear and straightfoward manner. Not this hocus-pocus create buggy script and display a message previously signed from 7 years ago.
He can just do what charlie lee did, and sign the message with his key. Its trivial. Yet he did not, which exposes his fraud.


No one knows who satoshi is, so why would he need to deflect? Payoff from the media I can agree with. That is a economic incentive, as well as the job opportunities he will gain from people believing he is satoshi.
I would like to hear some of these *valid* reasons that "seem irrational", because so far there are none.

Also, is the amount of btc split into 120 payment chunks (bi-monthly) and you just get that 1/120th each pay period? Or do they give you the amount of btc denominated in USD and then at the end of the 5 year contract you get the remainder, or not get paid the last few paychecks if it goes the other way?

Frankly any scenario in which developers and miners need to come to some social agreement will ultimately fail. Bitcoin does not work that way, this is not a government based technology where leaders get to decide what happens.

To everyone who posted in [my thread]( saying that we were in the "bear trap" phase.....
Looking like you were wrong, as I predicted. 
This is undeniably classic bubble phase as demonstrated by the runup for the last 30 days and the double mountain peak and now on the drop.
We will bottom out over the next week or two, and then the "return to mean" phase will begin again.
As stated previously, I think this will be in the 1300-1400 range.
That does not mean that this is not part of something bigger. I think bitcoin will continue to grow and there will be many of these bubble phases each one bigger than the next. But this is clearly traditional bubble pattern and I think we've seen the peak already for this run.

That authy is capable of being "reset" makes it glaringly a horrible, horrible choice. The *entire point* of 2FA is that you *have to physically possess* the 2FA device to login to your accounts.

Guys, this is very simple to me. This proposal is compatible with BIP148 and will get us SW in 2 months. That is what we want.
It includes protections from Luke that reduce sigops linear scaling ddos attack vectors by limiting max blocksize should the HF occur. 
This is what we want. If it turns out the HF proposal tries to sneak in covert asicboost or some other BS then we can rally against it.
I think we should reach consensus on this proposal and move forward, it seems to (finally) be a fair compromise. And remember, we can always softfork the blocksize down should we find it not needed in the future, though I doubt that is the case. 
This is coming from someone who has been strongly in favor of bip148 UASF and against all HF proposals.

Interest rate on a 30 yr fixed rate mortgage in kansas [3.93%](
30 year interest rate on bitcoin....?
10k / 220 = 45.45 coins. I think btc could be 10k easy within 10 years which would mean 450k vs your 72k. I see that as a conservative estimate considering the path bitcoin has been on.
You could have just done what everyone else in society does and work a job, get a mortgage and live your life. Then, you could have used that investment as your retirement fund and retired at age 32. Hell, could have been a lot more than a retirement fund. Could have been your yacht fund if things go better than conservative estimates.

The issue has always been the hard fork. If we can hardfork, then yes, we can fix the issue. As we are getting closer and closer to a possible hardfork, then this option becomes more viable.
With spoonnet, 12 months we should be able to safely upgrade the network via HF, limit transaction sizes NP.
But remember the context was always SW as a *softfork* so there was no trivial way to fix the issue for legacy blockspace that way.

Taiwanese arbitrage. The price is rising because people with banking access to bitfinex can sell at a $100 premium, wire their money to any other exchange, buy btc, withdrawal to bitfinex and sell, rinse and repeat.
Eventually the people who are stuck on bitfinex without fiat options (as in, everyone but Taiwanese natives) will either have sold all their coin and are holding fiat until the banking situation is resumed, or will have withdrawn all their btc from bitfinex.
There cannot be a lopsided supply/demand forever, but frankly I have no idea what the sell pressure supply is like on there so I dont know how long the wind will last.

There are a lot of assumptions being made there. If I've found one thing true over the years it's that you cannot expect rationality from the market.
If exchanges refuse to implement a BIP148 coin then Houston, we have a problem. We also need miners to coordinate how they are going to allow users to get bip148 coins to them without the exchanges.
Post August 1st, before SW activating, there is currently no way to ensure your coins get into a bip148 block. If they make an agreement with exchanges to mine their transactions, then that's one way. There needs to be collaboration between miners and wallet devs to figure this out asap, because there is going to be a chaotic few months where non *signaling* SW blocks are oprhaned, but no real SW txs yet, disallowimg an easy way to split the coins.

I understand this, and am very doubtful that the "Blockchain Alliance" will support fungibility. The obvious conclusion is that they are building rapport with these organizations in order to further their regulatory stance within the USA. This enables their continued existence within the state, which is a economic incentive to them and their investors. They cannot build rapport and deny the wishes of these organizations at the same time.
Regardless of the outcome, fungibility is already (partially?)addressed in BIP63, and we are not too far away from ZeroCash being a sidechain. I agree though, that in order for a broader impact, stealth addresses need to be used by default, as opposed to one-time use (or heaven forbid re-use) current address schemes.
If we wanted this behavior to be standardized as a *default*, then it would have needed to be implemented *by default*. Its not too late, but one of the best ways to address the issue is to make stealth addresses *easier* to use than regular addresses. Any increase of ease-of-use would lead to stronger adoption, which could then lead to the default behavior both you and I would like to see.

We agree there, but within a context. Working together as groups is actually the reason humans have survived, so while there is a specific amount of selfishness that could be contributed to evolution, the bigger factor is our evolution of social interoperability. 


We disagree there. Dont operate in black and whites. Its ok to be selfish about some things but not about others. 


Correct, I am, and im also willing to bet im right about the assumption. Why else would he have made such a patently stupid statement? Because someone was born in another country doesn't mean they can be American?
Last time I checked its citizenship that defines whether you are a American, not your accent. Whether or not he's a citizen is irrelevant in this situation because it wasn't his citizenship he was attacking but the fact that he is a non-white person with a accent (Yes, assumption again but I sincerely doubt im incorrect) This is gross stupidity on display here and you shouldn't advocate for or condone it. Stupid people need to be called out for their stupidity. Mr anti safe-spaces here would be arguing for the same level of accountability im sure, no coddling.

First, what does even mean? Im racking my brain trying to construct what he mean's and just cannot.




So, he says that you *need* a 'open platform' but that  its not good to have 'open validation', which im assuming he means public mining? That, I think I get.
But whats this 'you can have omission without centralization' comment? You can leave people out without having centralization? Well...yea? You always could, but did you know you can have red with your hamburger's feelings? Because thats what the statement sounds like to me. Nonsensical words phrased to make something sound smart but instead it just feels insane when you try to reckon what it means.




A 'private' cloud will be more secure? Firstly, whats a 'private cloud' ? A colo center that you own? rackmounts with harddrives? Are we calling your personal storage space a 'cloud' now? Have we forgotten that the basic premise of the term 'cloud' is the fact that its up there for anyone to grab? Its not private, so the analogy makes no sense.
How secure was targets cloud? How how about the US Governments 'private cloud' when it was hacked recently? Or &lt;insert 10's of thousands of private networks being hacked here example&gt; ? How fucking secure were those 'private clouds' ?
God these people are so stupid it makes me angry. They think that they can just ignore everything thats happening, plow forward with their systems ignoring the reality of the peoples suffering.
How many more [billions need to be stolen] ( from the people before these shitheads wake the fuck up and realize their private systems are not protecting the data, only creating targets?
And this Ludwin guy, the CEO of chain? Listen to what a imbecile he is:


First, bitcoin was designed to *bypass the banks*, and yes, that *is* fine, thank you. Secondly, how naive is he to think that bitcoin only has one case use, as a currency? A CEO of a 'blockchain' company who has *absolutely no clue* as to the vast amounts of developments currently underway, a lot of them already in beta mode, which is revolutionizing the financial industry *on the bitcoin blockchain*.
He's trying to rationalize that you should separate blockchain from bitcoin to 'let it be itself'. He's naive to how security of the network is the largest selling feature of *the blockchain*. I cannot wait for your company to fail Mr Ludwin.
Mark my words: Within a few years one of these 'private blockchains' is going to get hacked and its going to reak havoc on the system. And im going to be here with my big fat finger saying "I told you so you stupid, stupid people".

The data is not misleading, the data is open to interpretation. Now, if you want to take that data and extrapolate it to mean something it does not, the only aspect of that scenario that is misleading is the actions of the individual.
In this scenario the claim made based on the data we see could be in no way misconstrued. Clearly only one blockstream employee contributed any negligible amount of commits to the bitcoin repo.
That is obvious and indisputable.
If you apply critical thinking and understand the basic laws of averages, you can easily understand that whatever "quality vs quantity" variance that may exist will be evened out with the averages of all of the other 92% of commits. 
Only someone who wishes to purposefully misconstrue the data to create a false narrative would make the claim that Pieter's 168 commits has more weight than the 2000 commits by all other contributors.

ETH also makes large sacrifices to security in order to gain flexibility, but hopefully that will be resolvable with time. Otherwise rootstock is just going to take their marketshare.

Literally the only question I care about in this entire thread, including who wrote the script roger was reading in his video.
To this day the only obvious answer is that this was deception on Mark's part to try and prevent a bank run from making things worse.
People who play the house of cards get so deep they rationalize any scenario to justify the continuation of the house of cards.
I do not know what quid pro quo occured between Mark and Roger for the video, but *I damn well know there was one*. Only a fool thinks Roger put his entire reputation on the line for nothing. The most likely scenario was Roger wanted to get some of his btc out of Mt Gox in exchange for some PR.
To this day this is still one of the biggest unanswered scandals. Its obvious what happened, but we still get no admission from Mark or Roger as to the *actual reason* behind lying.
[Marks](response was a bunch of bullshit. Spun meaningless words. Obviously mark was at the helm of the PR and coordinated with roger to put that statement out.

He's probably right. You do realize that *several* layer 2 networks are about to launch right? There will be serious competition in the payment network space.
This will take the *majority* of load off the current blockspace. And thats not even considering the space savings offered by SW. So he's not that far off the mark. He's a bit extreme in his perspective, but its good to have both sides of the coin on the team.
Im not saying we should lower it, but I am saying that the current blockspace will open up drammatically in the next 3 months.
@_date: 2016-10-28 17:40:49


Well, we could discuss the serious logical flaws in your argument. 
The basis of your entire argument is about trying to create 1:1 parity between VISA users and LN users. That is a ridiculous comparison and shows you dont understand the nature of LN or how it works.
You and I, along with the other million bitcoin users, will likely never need to open a payment channel. Thats what routing is for. We are going to have a hub and spoke distributed node model and payment channels only need to be connected in some way across the network in order for the payment to route.
So, to make this really easy for you to understand.....
You can have 1,000 payment channels that a 100,000 users can use. Having a LN "wallet" is like having a "VISA". You can still use the network to send payments if you have a wallet. You are ignoring this fact and making a horribly flawed comparison. Its absurd to act like every person needs a payment channel to use the network....you are not understanding the system.
So, how about you reduce your moon math to 100:1, and maybe it will be more realistic. I think 1000:1 or 10,000:1 is actually closer to the mark, once LN matures.
So, no, not 5.13 years. You are comparing apples and oranges and have demonstrated you do not understand the nature of payment routing across a hub and spoke distributed node network.
VISA = LN Wallet
VISA = Payment channel

We have the largest funded company to date, who according to [other posts] ( has already been making hardware under a similar company name.
They are funded by qualcomm, a mega components manufacturer.

Devil's advocate in me says that some of the biggest bitcoin bull investors would not be going against their other investments...yet...thats precisely what investors do, spread the basket to decrease risk. And if anyone would know the in's and out's of bitcoin its the people who are invested into this 21.

See what a slippery slope this is? Now we get into the "Lets play central planning committee/regulators" of the bitcoin protocol. Why introduce extra central regulation when the situation is already solved in a elegant way?
I dont believe we should mickey mouse half-ass patches. When a real solution is developed for legacy space then we will implement it. Dont patch the hole in the boat with bubble gum. 
BU already tried this with parallel block construction and failed miserably. If this was a easy problem to solve it would have been solved already.
Thats why SW is so important. It solves this problem. 
You keep asking for extra blockspace for no reason. What benefit is there to having more blockspace that wont be needed which has higher risks?
When SW is activated you'll get what you want. Extra blockspace, fee pressure relief, etc. But you'll get it in a way that is safe for the network.
Yet here you are demanding something thats not needed, will add **zero** benefit to the network and opens up risks.
Dont you get how stupid it is to trade risks for zero benefit?

@_date: 2017-05-18 22:10:05


Yes. You've based the entirety of your economic assumptions on **hard drive space** and that is a strawman fallacy that does not answer the relevant questions.
The issue has little to do with harddrive space and everything to do with RAM and bandwidth. 
If you wish to truly determine the cost upon the network between various proposals then you need to evaluate bandwidth but most imporantly impact on RAM.
If you want a good starting place, please refer to [Bitfury's research into impact of RAM on node resources](
I cannot take this "analysis" seriously if the author cannot even figure out what the most costly resources are to run a node.
If you are to do the analysis properly, you must also be able to articulate how the increased RAM and bandwidth resources will effect node count and therefore decentralization. Anything that does not take into account these factors has no place in being used as a "pro" or "against" argument.
You cannot cherry pick a single irrelevant fact and use that as the basis for determination. Thats not how an intelligent engineer makes tradeoff concessions.

No, he encouraged a HF at a future date. Thats a completely non-scientific way to approach the situation. We have no idea how much blockspace will be utilized once SW and LN are active. Forcing **another** central planning "Do this and we will do this" agreement is not how bitcoin works.
It fell to pieces last time, so why anyone would think its a rational course this time is beyond me.

Im happy to see Garzik listening to feedback on the issue. What we really need is maximum compatibility here. There is already a widely deployed SW installation base and any changes to any proposal that seeks to activate those pending clients without forcefully upgrading the network is a win.

That is what im referring to. Sorry, there is no standard nomenclature for it and I see it referenced a variety of ways here. I never know what to call it :P We need a codename for it, like "Turkey Giblits DDOS".
The reasoning behind it is it does not allow miners to craft a malicious block that is going to take *minutes* to verify. If big blockers were not so gung-ho about getting it their way despite there being zero technical justifications, they would realize that SW accomplishes the blocksize increase, which is exactly what they want, and does it in a way that solves a variety of problems to boot. The problem is since they want it their way, then they leave the network open to attack by quandratic hashing by increasing the legacy blocksize. I personally think its dumb to open the network to that attack at 2mb as-is, but if thats whats really needed to get this show on the road then ffs lets do it. But 4mb no way. Thats several minutes of hashing a malicious block. That could wreak serious chaos on the network.

First, there were not "rumors", you could see the data openly. I don't have time to dig up the quarterly books (on the way to see ready player one!), but the most basic of reddit searching could have directed you to [this post](
























Very shoddy "journalism".
Also, "entering the market" does not necessarily mean buying. For all we know these people are going to short the shit out of btc, causing massive panic, then buying at the bottom to control the supply. Thats what I would do if I had billions.

Please correct me if I am wrong, but it seems that the launch of this BIT ETF-Like investment vehicle will not plausibly add any value to the current price of bitcoin. See quote:


It also said:


So, im not really sure how this is benefical to the bitcoin community. It seems to me that its just a way for *really* rich people to capitalize off early investments they made buying bitcoin in 2013, and according to the article it speculates that there may not be any secondary market at all because these investors may simply choose to hold on to their shares.
I feel it is important to discuss this, to determine whether this will have any realistic impact on the liquidity of the market. Just reading the article, I would think that only the winklevoss ETF will have a real effect upon other bitcoin exchanges as they are required to make purchases in order to satisfy reserves as people purchase shares. I believe it was 1 btc for every 5 paper btc purchased?
It appears no such requirement is existing for BIT, and no catalyst to propel the market forward.
EDIT - This has been clarified by in his [post] (


This will likely have very limited liquidity, and as a consequence, very limited impact on the market. Because new shares cannot be publicly issued or traded, the arbitrage mechanism by which a fully approved and operational ETF can maintain price parity with its underlying asset (and also expand and contract supply as necessary) will not be available.
If, hypothetically, lots of people wanted to buy this product to gain exposure to bitcoin, they would just deplete the supply and that would be it - no more bitcoin being bought to create new shares, as would be the case in a traditional ETF (where authorized participants, in theory, could trade lots of shares for BTC or lots of BTC for shares with the operator of the ETF).
Anybody with the means and interest to acquire exposure to bitcoin already has a menu of options, including just buying bitcoin instead of a fund or security tied to bitcoin. Since this will still involve additional costs and complexity, have limited supply, and not be as readily available as a traditional ETF, I don't think this will have nearly the impact many suspect the ETF will have (I also question how much impact the ETF would have if it went live, but this analysis is focused on comparing this to the ETF)."

Yes, he was rather rational about it. I think he's right, it does not make sense for the US to hold reserves of BTC *right now*. The chance of a speculative attack on USD is pretty slim, even with Saudi Arabia threatening exactly that right now, due to how detrimental it would be to their own economic sovereignty.
And he said he's willing to be convinced at a later time. Thats a pretty positive position if you ask me. He clearly does not understand it all and is willing to examine the data at a later time when its more substantial. 
Entirely fair. 
But for smaller nations it does make sense to hold BTC in reserves. Every basket contains risk, and you should definitely have a small portion of high risk high reward assets in yours.

How do you know it is irrelevant without seeing the technicals? Since this drama started there is one big fat detail that I've been dying to find out....
How will this proposal be implemented? Will it be implemented to allow asicboost?
Seems to me that Jihan and Co are going to fight tooth and nail to keep it in, which means not compromising on proposals that defeat the technology.
If Sergio is indeed involved then he is going to push for asicboost compatibility.
This needs to be shut down and there needs to be transparency. People need to know the details so that they can make better reasoned distinctions. This is absolutely relevant to the bigger picture here.
The bigger picture is preventing centralization effects, which means shutting down asicboost, which means making sure people like Sergio and Jihan are not poisoning the well with implementations that allow asicboost. I dont care who has patents or what elites or industry executives want. I want a decentralized bitcoin that **resists exactly these kinds of people**.
I dont get why everyone forgets this so often. Executives making decisions in rooms is exactly the thing bitcoin was meant to deter.
And when did Sergio work for bitmain? Thats news to me and reeks of suspicion.

Again, as I stated in the first post, I think we are discussing two different things. You've consistently misconstrued my intent and purpose and then elaborated strawmen to attack my position.
My position is that we must analyze and understand transactional data within a system so that we can craft policy top down that benefits everyone within the system.
I am not certain, because you've not stated clearly (only implied) that the **only** solution to this problem is through the market. Again, im not certain you believe this but judging by your above commentary you seem to be implying this is the case.
As I stated in my previous post (which you failed to answer my question of contradiction, because I think you realized I was not making a contradictory statement) I believe that even this "spam" (as I see it) is viable economic activity, assuming that they are paying the fee to have their transaction confirmed and not trying to spend from a unconfirmed parent (which would render it pseudo-economic activity).
My position, quite clearly so that you may not misconstrue it, is that in order for this *network* to operate efficiently it needs to be designed in a way that is fair and open to everyone.
If there is a design flaw that allows the exploitation of the system, are you saying that we should just give up and "let the market decide"?
Thats why I asked if you were libertarian. I see that sort of mentality here a lot. This free market ideology (that doesn't exist) where in some fantasy land where everyone is equal and access is equal and everything is equal the market will decide fairly.
I believe that no system is perfect, especially not a system that so heavily relies upon human construction. I also believe that if we are to improve the design so that it is more fair to all participants that we must analyze the cause and effect of behaviors within a system.
Are you saying that we should not analyze economic activity to craft policy?
That "everything should be treated equal" and we are supposed to blind ourselves to reality?

Oh, ok, I get where you are going now. Yes, that would be beneficial but the question is at what cost? How much more data would be required to include the data? 
Interesting idea though. What if at the time of construction it includes the hash of the last block, and if the hash is a block thats more than "x" blocks old, then the node will reject it?
I dont understand the crypto enough to understand how much cost there would be on additional bytes added to the tx, but cool idea.

If you dont believe in decentralization and immutable ledgers, sure, the right decision was made.
This is just like the bailouts and banks being too big to fail. Sorry, but if you write shitty code and you convince enough ass clowns to seed your broken ICO, then all of those investors deserved to get burned when the ship sailed with holes.
You think it was right to bail out investors after they made a risky investment and got burned? You also think it was right for the "benevolent dictator", who had enormous skin in the game because he was a major investor......to push to bail out those who made poor judgements?
This is the main argument why ETH is a joke and bitcoin will prevail supreme in the long run. There are plenty of interesting case uses for ETH in smart contracts for trivial amounts of money, or even non-trivial amounts of money for legacy financial players who wish to have mediators in the event that things go sour and they need a bail out.
I could care less how much ETH is worth. Its a centralized shitcoin that has proven to been a mutable ledger.

Yes, it was a obvious exaggeration, which is well in line with the tone of my message. 180k from LN alone, which does not include the changes introduced from the various BIP's included with SW, nor does it include all of the 2nd layer networks that are competing with LN.
When you consider all of the things that have interdependencies upon SW, and SW itself, I do not think its an exaggeration to state it exceeds a million lines of code. If not now, definitely very soon. So its not like I was way way way off the mark.


Do you deny these things -
Payment Channels/Lightning network, Malleability Fixes, Linear scaling of sighash operations (ddos protection), increased P2SH security, Script Versioning, Reduction of UTXO growth, a 1.6-2MB blocksize upgrade
Seems massive to me. Also, 180k lines of code is pretty massive, and thats just *one* network. We will have to disagree on the usage of that term here.

Did you think that through before writing that? It makes no sense from a logical perspective.
The better we estimate fee's, the more accurate the fee estimation becomes, which means the less amount of fee money is being paid, which lowers overall fee requirements. So if we can gain a 20% efficiency from this, we would go from 300 sat/byte to 260 sat byte. The more people that better submit accurate fee's the less pressure there is and the less people pay. 
It has a compounding effect both ways. An inaccurate fee estimation will drive prices up and become self inflicting in a looping event, just like more accurate fee prediction means fee's going down into an equilibrium is found.

I suppose you are correct on a technical basis, as methods such as CBC, which *are* clearly related to 'block chain' technology, did exist long long ago (1976 I see CBC was invented).
However, on relevant terms, the 'blockchain' we are discussing today is not a general technology, but specifically the bitcoin styled blockchain. For example, if you read:


Which is what I was referring to.
So, technically, yes, you can have a 'block chain' that is not based on a PoW (or similar) type system, but then it would not really be the blockchain that we are discussing today, as in the one referenced in the wiki article above.
I think its important to note that when satoshi open sourced and released bitcoin, he really *redefined* the term 'blockchain'. So maybe where we can come to terms is to say that prior to 2009 block chain technology was not PoW (or similar) based, but post 2009 it is. Lets call it PoW-Blockchain if you want, but the times *have* changed.

I agree completely and I think the long term future of bitcoin is extremely healthy, and will be as robust as ever post SW activation.

You did not need to repeat what I already wrote. There is no confusion on my end but you've demonstrated a enormous amount of confusion in general about bitcoin.


That was modeled based on "current" (as of, like 6 months ago) usage of p2sh / p2pkh.
You are not taking into account how transaction behaviors will change when the cost matrix is realigned with segwit. That is why you dont understand how *current* usage once SW is enabled will take it much beyond 2.1mb.

Two things of note about this video -
First, they said in the video they *hope* to become the catalyst for bitcoin's price increase after one of the hosts asked about bitcoin being down 22% this year (misleading title)
Secondly, they stated that they are "in talks" with market makers, and that it is just *dialogue* at this point. Read between the lines (or just read them straight out) and you will notice that they are saying they have not provided any liquidity to Gemini. 
I sure hope this changes, as in the AMA I recall one of them stating they *already have* market makers, which seems to be conflicting information.

Either way, it was entirely immature of you to bring politics into a technical argument.
You are right, global payments are not free. Good thing we have a little thing called a *block subsidy* that compensates those participants for mining transactions. 
I think its time for your arguments to evolve. We now understand with clarity that layer 2 services are going to be the one negotiating the bulk of on-blockchain transactions. What people are willing to pay for a on-chain transaction will be irrelevant when layer2 services come into play and start to fine tune the market on fee's.

This is why that specific advance fee scam theory above is ludicrous.
This guy scammed the Aus government 53 million dollars. Do you guys really think its logical that he needs to scam a few people out of a couple hundred bucks? Hell, even if people were going to donate millions (no one would) it would be a drop in the ocean of what he's already gotten away with.
The main incentive is for him to to be jailed for life for stealing Australian taxpayers dollars. He would need to prove that he owned the bitcoin that he claims the tulip trust holds that was spent on R&amp;D that he received the 53m tax subsidy for.
If he can fool enough people into believing that he is satoshi, then he has *a chance* at fooling the Aus government too. Frankly I still dont think he would get away with it, because there is either a paper trail or there is not, and eventually they would realize he's running in circles.

Is it also a optimization when you are being paid for janitorial services and you decide to just sweep all the dirt under the door mat?
Thats not a "optimization", thats called "pretending to work" or "doing half the job".
The entire point of **proof** of work, is that it **proves you did the work**. If you shortcut that work through a "optimization" when everyone else is doing it the way they are supposed to, thats not called excellence, thats called cheating.
If you understood whats at stake here you wouldn't be advocating for such stupidity. The only thing that keeps bitcoin secure is a even playing field. Trying to rationalize that its ok for the largest mining conglomerate to use a secret advantage to shortcut work is like arguing that Walmart doesn't need to pay taxes when everyone else does.

If the estimation is more accurate, then it will be closer to $1 and with less of a gap those unconfirmed transactions will have a better likelihood of getting confirmed as there becomes gaps in the backlog (as there have always been). This will then lead to lower fee's getting confirmed, and lower, etc. Its self-reinforcing.
At some point there will be a perm backlog and that scenario wont apply anymore, but as of now its still valid. [120 days according to this analysis](

Miners are their own node. The entire context of this discussion is miners constructing malicious blocks that take abnormal resources to process. I could be mistaken, but I believe *changing* this rule would require a HF, and is therefore a non-starter. We can add new rules via SF but not change consensus critical rules.
It is irrelevant whether a tx over 100k is non-standard because the maximum transaction size allowed is the size of the block. You could change that parameter from 100k to 500k and it would do nothing to resolve the issue. See [proof here](
    if (::GetSerializeSize(tx, SER_NETWORK, PROTOCOL_VERSION) &gt; MAX_BLOCK_SIZE)
        return state.DoS(100, error("CheckTransaction(): size limits failed"),
                         REJECT_INVALID, "bad-txns-oversize");

You are correct in that providing negative evidence is not a good way to counter the argument. I might also add that Jimmy song doesn't need to be an economist to point out common sense.
I would also take economists with a grain of salt as any good bitcoiner should. Nassim Taleb and Piketty are probably the only two I really care about anymore.
It is absolutely true that if ethereum has taken a large chunk of the market share. But I don't really see this necessarily as a bad thing because ETH and Bitcoin serve different purposes. Right now while the industry is still not mature it's difficult to see the difference between the two but for those of us who are steepled within this industry and understand the focal points of both of these currencies you can see that there is a clear divide for use cases between these two competing cryptocurrencies.
Right now ethereum is only utilized for ICOs. It is not really utilized for any other economic activity at least not in any way that we've been able to measure in any significant amount yet. ETH also appears to be positioning itself as a corporate coin with its ethereum project board of CEOs and HF mutability aspects. 
BTC will remain the King as a settlement network as long as it continues to focus upon its decentralized properties. Don't forget that with the Advent of lightning Network we will see Atomic cross chain swapping in which both of these currencies will be utilized in smart contract scenarios.
It's also important to understand that everything has bubble phases and money goes in and money goes out. That doesn't mean that there is underlying fundamental value. This value is only demonstrated over long periods of time in which use cases must appear and stability must be proven. I'm not saying ETH won't prove itself but more that we should be cautious and not make assumptions about the current state of financial markets without the years of proof missing from the equation.

According to who? Not according to the majority of experts who reached consensus in 2015. You obviously are living in a echo chamber and not listening to the 95%+ of real experts.


If you wish to think like a engineer then you need to understand every change or lack of change has a cost benefit relationship. So when you want to make a change you must weigh the cost and the benefit to determine which path creates the optimum outcome.
SegWit would be slightly "cleaner" as a hardfork because there are some rules you cannot change with a softfork. So what is the cost and what is the benefit?
The cost is the guaranteed split of the network to the massive detriment of all. If you dont think that is the case then you simply have not been around long enough or paying attention enough to see that there are clear factions within the industry that are willing to uphold their viewpoints no matter the extremity. 
So you are willing to risk the health of the entire network for a *slightly* "cleaner" approach to something that accomplishes the *same exact thing* when done as a SF? Thats a enormous downside with little upside.
The SF has all the benefits of the upgrade with little to no risk at all when done properly.
When you view the problem from the angle of a systems engineer, and actually understand the tradeoffs, its a simple discussion.
The technicals were debated long ago and long ago those in the know understood there was no debate. Those not in the know continued to be entrenched by philosophical and political attacks by the other side who lacked the ability to argue technical merits.
There is no debate here. There is only misinformed, uninformed, and malicious actors.

Thats what happens when you have a unlimited supply of ETH flooded into the market with FOMO. 91 million ETH vs 16 million BTC in case you didn't know.
I could care less about the percentage of "market cap" value used as a barometer for how successful bitcoin is. Its entirely irrelevant. 
The only thing that matters is how much these currencies are used outside of an exchange. How often is ETH used to purchase groceries? I would wager *never*. Yet bitcoin actually is. Bitcoin is used to book flights, to buy products, to buy homes, cars etc.
The real measure of its value is its economic utility.When we should start to get worried is when ETH starts taking substantial market share away from bitcoin in those scenario's. Until that happens I dont care if ETH gets pumped to $500, it does not reflect negatively whatsoever on bitcoin.
Remember, rootstock will make ETH contracts secured by bitcoin. So the two's success are intertwined. The better ETH does, the better bitcoin does. Add LN to the mix and then you have atomic cross chain value swapping and then the relationship becomes even more symbiotic.

I sincerely doubt that we will have a year long bubble phase, especially considering we've been through this before and we've seen how quickly the market moves. With access to crypto even less frictional now with multiple regulated entities offering quick purchase and selling options, that should expedite the bubble transitions, not slow it down.
The last bubble was Oct to early january 2013 from the run up after the bear trap to the bull trap. So, approx 3 months. This time (if im right) it would be approx 5 weeks.
I think this model fits taking into consideration enhanced market access.
Information travels quicker than ever and continues to speed up as our reliance upon technology builds in social communications. This means that bubble phases should transition quicker, not slower.

@_date: 2017-05-03 15:59:43


Im actually in the same block. I can remember getting in heated arguments with over blocksize issues. I used to be a vocal big block supporter here and defender of Gavin. Now when I read Alex's blog I am always inspired by his depth of understanding not just the technicals, but also the socio economic side, and I can see how Gavin's ideological positions has interfered with his rational thinking on issues of decentralization.


Same! For well over a year I paraded the big block ideology because I couldn't grasp the actual threat. One thing that helps greatly is understanding that resources are not compounded in linear fashion, nor are physical resources all cost aligned equally. This starts to unfold a mental map of how decentralization is greatly effected by resource costs.
It helps a lot if you have a background in networking (I do), because it helps to understand the adversarial aspects of p2p networks in regards to denial of service attacks, bitcoins broadcast system and transparent node topology that all leaves bitcoin very vulnerable to large scale attacks. It would be beyond trivial for a state actor to DDOS bitcoins network today. Hell, anyone with a reasonable amount of bitcoin to buy botnets could put 85% of the nodes offline today if they just spent 15 minutes building an attack map from bitnodes. 
With some real network analysis you could start to sniff nodes incoming broadcasted transactions/blocks to determine who the miners are and ready the battlefields to attack not just non-mining but full-mining nodes as well. One could wreak widescale destruction reasonably efficiently with some heavy botnet sources, all purchasable on the deep net *today*.
The thing that keeps bitcoin truly safe is optimal decentralization, especially over TOR and other similar networks. But bitcoin cannot operate over TOR if the blocksize is unbounded and we see dank pepe spam fill the blocks up quickly for &lt;insert your favorite fatcom like blockchain service here&gt;. People dont realize that bitcoin has entered the minds of mainstream sillicon valley and that means entrepreneurial access to the blockchain will bloat it as fast as we expand it for "Caitlyn Jenner Nude Pics here" business models.  
We would quickly move beyond the bandwidth resources of TOR, and the average home laptop wouldn't be able to keep up with the network. Only the optimizations of the past years by Core has kept it so that we can still run raspberry pi's as nodes.
BUT, to the point of the comic, it states that it does not know how to fix it. I do. It wont be easy and all of our battles is in pursuit of this "fix".
I've written about it extensively [here]( and it is the only known "cure" to core idea entrenchment.
EDIT - Just got done listening to the podcasts and they were fantastic! They absolutely do have solutions to counter this problem and there was even a [handbook written on the subject]( While this book does not mention my above "fixing" idea, the podcast actually does and goes into great detail on it. We will never fix this issue unless we alter the opinion of entrenched "trusted" actors within a specific identity group. In this case, changing Roger Ver's mind on the issue would help. We have no hope of changing Jihan Wu's mind because we know that he's being economically rational (even if in his own mind) and the issue is not about identity politics but money.

Absolutely I dont disagree. The point of my post was merely to emphasis the bubble phase and how it correlates with bitcoin markets. When you see a perfect run up and a double peak overlay, then you know that you are experiencing a traditional bubble phase.

Using a linux Live-OS distribution with a persistent wallet. Most *definitely* not coinbase, which makes it a realistic opportunity for people to target and hack/steal coins.
See proof here:
And if you think using coinbase is easier than using a linux wallet, you are mistaken. Copying a sending address and selecting a amount to send is the same process whether you are inputting it into a coinbase web based wallet or a linux based wallet.
The only usage for coinbase is for people who do not understand the brilliance behind bitcoin and are too lazy to research. Coinbase is not a bitcoin service, they are a bank that allows inbound and outbound bitcoin transfers. 
Be your own bank, and teach your kid how to do so. If you think a 10 year old cannot do what I specified above, then your 10 year old is a retard. I've had 3 10 year old siblings and we did *tons* of computer stuff, and this would have been just as easy as coinbase.

While certainly a valid attack, it only highlights the further need to ensure the network remains decentralized. These types of attacks can only exist if pools own a majority of hashing power. 
I think a much more serious threat is a large scale ddos attack on all the nodes. While we have services such as cloudflare to help block these types of attack, we leave ourselves vulnerable to centralized control of our network.
Another valid argument on how we can find a way to incentivize nodes. Im starting to think the only way we can do that is by starting a crowdfunding campaign via the community to award node operators with proceeds for their efforts.
Of course this would require node operators to be able to submit proof of node operation. Its existence alone is not enough as we have seen proxies play a part in multiplying the node count fraudulently.

You are viewing it as a "either or" situation when it is not. There are costs and benefits to changes within a system. The benefit to a hardcapped limit is a robust fee market that sustains miner revenue.
How else are miners going to be paid in the following years?
Security is vastly more important than cost. The cost to transact will be 0.00 because no one will use bitcoin if its not secure.
SW is already a compromise in this effect. Its already giving a much larger than neccessary blocksize increase to future proof it, even though it will not be utilized until many years from now. The tradeoff is worth it.
I dont want spam, but I think the temporary SW blocksize increase tradeoff is worth the reduction of cost/miner revenue in the short term because long term we will hit the edges again when the block reward is lower.

@_date: 2015-09-02 16:54:35


WOW. This is actually the BEST idea I've heard in a long time! I've thought about this issue in the past and the obvious bottleneck for cross-platform order matching is database speed plus financial risk - which exchange will trust which other exchanges to pay out their cross platform market matchers?
Buuuuuut....if there were a cheap fast secure network that could hold tangible assets that could be traded back and forth, this would resolve that issue.
Why cant this already be done on the blockchain as-is? Seems that the biggest hurdle is getting these exchanges together to agree to do such a thing. Seems that this would eat into their profits as exchanges can then attempt to front run other exchanges to steal fee's. There would have to be latency added into the mix to prevent this from occurring, or the systems would need to be re-arranged so that there's a special 'cross-platform' exchange pool where all orders placed on that book are known to be cross platform so it does not interfere with the order matching on the native system.
This *must* have already been thought up by exchanges. What are the obstacles and how can we as a community help move this forward?

I've learned the [the importance of reputation systems]( and how easily angry mobs of uneducated individuals can be steered into group think mentalities that effects [consensus on issues](
I've learned that [Complacency is much more dangerous than Fatalism](
I've learned that [There has been a coordinated multi-year effort to increase the fee rate that users must pay for bitcoin transactions]( as well as [academic research confirming this in 2015](
I've learned that the moderators are pretty fair here, specifically because of my personal evolution from a big blocker to a decentralizer, as well as getting banned multiple times and resolving the issues. As a known contributor here one must accept that if mods are willing to ban me, they are pretty even handed. 
I've learned that no matter how hard I try, my emotions get the best of me and debate can often turn into a flurry of angry shitposting. I've also learned that im not the best example of how to sway people because im often too blunt and aggressive.
I've learned that some people seem to have no limit to how much personal time they are willing to put into shitposting provably false information through multiple accounts to attempt to skew the discussion towards a specific narrative.
I've learned the perils of trusting any singular developer. Take a look at Gavin who is now publicly supporting a [publicly proven fraudster]( who is pretending to be Satoshi. This guy used to be in charge of bitcoin. How scary is that?
I've learned that the market will often go in the exact opposite direction of what all common sense dictates in that it will drop hard when there's good news and rally during cold winter of misery, possibly due to contrarian whales trying to catch leveraged positions.
I've learned a fascinating amount of information on general finance, economics, political views and socioeconomics mostly. The way we all interact and how we evolve over time is really cool. Watching the nakamoto consensus in action resolve the situation when we cannot come to social consensus on issues is really cool.
I've learned that meritocracy is important and that we must value and appreciate those academics who contribute peer review to our field, and we must stay strong to counter the anti-intellectualism that is constantly barraged against our ecosystem by malicious actors who seek to divide and destroy.

It would be, especially so with a UASF and a possible chain split coming.

By not having any of the services within a society that we recognize as essential today.
Where was the space programs, the national institute for health, the environmental protection agency 100 years ago?
There are a lot of correlations between bitcoin and America if you are educated on both fronts. I see the parallels quite clearly. Just like with America, as it started growing there came growing pains. Eventually the population got to be too large and there started being consequences of industrialization on large scale. You can police a small town fine with a sheriff and your two goons, but what about a city of 10,000? 100,000? 1,000,000? 10,000,000? You can dump your wastewater in the river burning energy for a 1,000 people, but what about a million?
These small self-organized organizations to deal with public safety and security do not scale. Thats why we are divided into regional maps like towns cities and counties. So that we can scale the services to the area. But even these small area's are highly densely populated area's that require enormous wealth to manage safety and public services for.
Libertarians will argue that "the free market fixes that" and that we should just privatize everything and let the market work through it. 
Look at how well that has worked for Coal mining, Oil fields, power plants and anything else that impacts our society. These theories only work if you live inside a vacuum and can isolate factors that exist in reality that you cannot control. 
Profits mean more than liberty to industry. If you do not create regulations to govern industry then industry will massively fuck over every person they know and the billions they dont know in pursuit of profit. There is no such thing as a free market within a governed society. In order for a free market to work then all must be equal and there must be no interference from regulatory bodies.  Right there we know this is a fantasy because such a condition cannot exist.


Why dont you ask venezuela and greece? Things are a million times better than they would be if we did not enforce taxes, and thats the point.
You'll get no argument from me that the current state of affairs is sub-optimal, but its way way better than a lot of others have it, and a million times better than we would have with anarchy.
Why dont we instead look at the countries with the current highest standard of living? Places like Denmark, Sweeden? They have enforced taxation at some of the highest levels and look at how prosperous and happy their people are? They live the longest, they live the healthiest and have the least amount of socioeconomic problems. Of course we can cherry pick details from those countries that we dont like, but on the whole they are clearly superior to our bloated poisonous bureaucratic system.


70% of our GDP economic activity is domestic, so that wouldn't change very much. The government is better qualified to spend money when you have a engaged non-apathic educated population to appoint representatives with appropriate checks and balances of powers that work for the people and not for industry.
I could write a encyclopedia on the shit America does wrong.


In 1890 the census shows 62,979,766 people in America. Thats less than 1/5th of the current population. The problem is that with population growth comes resource management issues. Without a regulatory body to monitor the resource management then the resource management will fuck over the people. Even now, we have regulatory capture within these regulatory bodies and there is still some amount of fucking over the people.
But we are way way *way* better off with this semi-fucked system than we would be without checks and balances. Of course businesses and corporations need to be taxed the same as people.
I think there should be a flat tax on all economic activity. I think we should do away with this absurd notion of tiers and financial discrimination. Whether your a corporation or joe, you should pay the same amount of taxes based on your economic activity.
But again, this is where bitcoin is a problem. There is no way to enforce that unless we build gateways that everyone must operate in. Once you create a economic incentive for people to avoid those gateways then there will exist a blackmarket for economic activity to thrive.
As long as the majority of the population operates in the clear then this gateway system would work. Its like piracy....it doesn't hurt (and even helps some) as long as the barrier is high. But if it becomes easy to everyone then it kills the industry since no one buys shit.

This sort of behavior is fuel for negative campaigning, and the less of it the better for bitcoin. Also, healthy economies using bitcoin (immoral or not) increases transaction volume, usage, etc and that is good overall for sustaining the network.

This guy sounds like a idiot. 'no one knows but it will *definitely* be this or that'.
Except LTC just had a halving and it had *zero* effect on price. That is a much more accurate gauge on what bitcoin will do, not comparing a unknown change of supply that occurred in a commodity. We *know* the halving is coming.

I think you're trying to make a black and white scenario out of something that is rich and full of color. You cannot ignore the context of the situation in that segwit was highly tested and vetted by all of the experts in the industry industry over the last few years.
The only reason 148 had an effect is because consensus was already reached across the industry that segwit was the smart path forward. This is demonstrated on coin dance where you can see that 95% of the industry supported segwit. The only thing that stopped it was miners who have politicised their position by abusing bip9 powers that were granted to them. Trust me in that that mistake won't happen again bip8 will be the new de facto upgrade standard.
This scenario works for non-controversial changes but the scenario in which you are stipulating is a controversial change.

When you purposefully obstruct the network with a malicious intent to skew fee metrics with no economic intention whatsoever then that is quite obviously defined as malicious behavior.
When you are trying to spend unconfirmed childs of a parent tx with a super high fee rate you are **not** engaging in economic activity and your "no such definition" does not apply.
There is quite clearly a **attack** with **malicious** intentions that are nothing other than to increase the cost of using bitcoin.
There are valid economic uses for the network and then there are purposefully crafted malicious transactions.
Do not confuse the two and try to put them in the same category.
Now, with that said I agree that bitcoin needs to be resilient against these types of attacks. Which is why we've had a safe blocksize increase that *specifically corrects utxo costs so that this type of attack cannot be abused*.

....we must be living in 2 different universes. Because I recall several months of blog posts, twitter rants and chinese translations where Jihan first denied it, then accepted it, then tried to deny that it was hurtful to the ecosystem....and only after 1-2 months of intense scrutiny and criticism did he start to change his tune. And then SW was to be activated on LTC (this is **during** asicboost drama remember?) and then Jihan prevented the activation by doubling the hashrate on LTC overnight and specifically not signaling support, and it was only under the threat of a coordinated UASF that they backed out.
in case your memory is needing updating -


No, there wasn't. You can pretend there was by claiming that politics is infact technical arguments. But there were not any valid technical arguments against SegWit. There was ecosystem wide consensus amongst all experts that this was the best path forward.


I think I see where you are playing semantics here. One Cpu = one vote is implied in that one cpu = one human. 
Do you really disagree with that framework when satoshi released the whitepaper? Because if you do you are grossly contorting satoshi's words. "One vote", like any system in any fair society means "one human". If a ASIC manufacturer can get **millions** of votes, then *that is not a fair system*.

Especially since the best data we have on halving and impact on price has shown us ZERO gains. Look at the LTC market, the price has not been effected by the halving. What should have happened if the price did not go up is the hash rate should have gone down. But it didn't.
Speculation is that the chinese are getting free or near free electrical and their costs is near zero, so they can afford to run their legacy equipment for as long as it runs.

Andreas has been Pro-SW from the very start. He has always been on Core's side.


No, nodes have *decreased* not increased. We've known this for a long time. Node count has not been growing linearly with transaction count and thats a big problem.


No we do not. Dude, why do you come on here and just say things? There's no way you have that data because it doesn't exist. We can never accurately measure node counts due to sybil attacks. Dont just say things to make yourself sound right, thats retarded.
Just because someone can spin up a few thousand free AWS nodes for 60 days to skew the numbers for &lt;insert fav proposal here&gt; does not equate to real nodes doing real work. 
Lukes site has the best data that I've seen on node counts because it only counts nodes that connect to his node, so it gives a better reflection on which nodes are actually hosting the blockchain and working as real nodes, not just a single node with a 100 amazon AWS ip's pointed at it. 
You need to stop with the naive narrative that we dont need to worry about decreased node counts. We cannot expect bitcoin to remain anti-fragile and resilient to state actors running nodes on data centers. We need 10's of thousands of people around the world running bitcoin nodes and utilizing TOR like networks to prevent central attack points.

Are you speaking for dev's now? How about we quote your best friend [Gavin](


Dev's do not see limiting transaction sizes as a reasonable fix. Yes, that means Gavin is on the record saying 2mb of non-witness data is dangerous. Pretty much **all** other dev's concur. Nice delusion though.
Nothing has changed from when he made that post. That includes secp256k1. There is no "fix" other than SW.
This laymen idea of "We should just limit the transaction to 1mb" **does not fix the issue**. Transactions limited to 1mb **still takes 25 seconds to validate when constructed maliciously**.
If you've not spent time thinking how dangerous that is, then shame on you for shitposting without even considering the risks.
Real developers do not introduce new attack vectors to bitcoin. The situation as it is already presents opportunity for large actors to attack bitcoin. Do you forget the real purpose of bitcoin? Its to create a financial system for the people to protect against state control. 
That means large state actors will see it as within their rational economic interest to waste money attacking bitcoin. They will use every hole they can manipulate to clog the network. The funny part is, we are already experiencing that from people you adore like Roger and his incessant spam attacks and Jihan with asicboost and empty blocks.
The more I see you post the more I become convinced that you do not have bitcoins best interests at heart and seek to sow chaos and discord.
The point to remember here **IS THAT SW FIXES THIS ISSUE** (and many others, including all our present growing pains). So while you shitpost about how we can fix it, the solution is already here and we have to deal with malicious actors like you attempting to prevent the solutions. How about you just support the solution instead of constantly shitposting misinformation?

Which, is pretty hard proof he is satoshi, or part of a group that is satoshi, *if* that business was not just another relay attack, but preformed in private on Gavin. I think this whole business of Craig going through hoops to fool people into believing he is satoshi by fabricating proof through a replay attack only proves he is *not* satoshi. 
Otherwise why wouldn't he have just signed a message with the key that everyone could verify and be done with it?
I think that would be as much proof as we will ever get. I too, also agree, that Gavin will loose major credibility if this pans out to be another hoax, which it does look like.

No, they would not. They are using the rails as a payment network, they are not speculating on the asset. It is market speculators who fill the order books and build support. Just because a bank wishes to cheapen their payment rails does not mean they wish to speculate. 


Opinion based on a false assumption. I disagree. The banks cannot use the rails unless there are order books that can support the volume or market makers that are very large and providing 100's of millions in liquidity. Just because a bank has money does not mean that it wishes to utilize its capital in market speculation. I would think they are doing the opposite: trying to gain through utilizing the network while specifically avoiding speculation.

The idea that the blockchain could be used as a censor-proof store of history? I've seen it mentioned quite a few times in articles or posting on I ~~do not have any links~~, only my memory. This is not a new concept. Love james to death, but I've seen this idea before.
EDIT (I added a URL to parent post from last year which discusses this)
Regardless, I do not think it will solve the problem of rewriting history. Yes, computers can edit data, as his video entails. But you can also obscure data through other data. Just because something is written into the blockchain does not make it true, and this is the underlying reason why it does not serve as a better store of history than our textbooks.
Whether its moses writing it in stone, or jimmy storing it in the blockchain, the burden of proof still requires other data to verify. The dataset must be conclusive in order for us to all maintain it is 100% true, and whether that data is stored in the blockchain, usb key, text book or betamax tapes, they are all susceptible to the same flaws.

This entire situation reminds me of the political atmosphere in the USA right now.
There is a strong, but marginal, support for Donald Trump. And that marginal strong support is willing to burn the house down instead of just fixing the garbage disposal.
Who cares that this release fixes numerous incredibly important issues with bitcoin? We want bigger blocks now! Who cares about transactional malleability? We dont need 2nd layer services!
The greater point is, direct democracy fails unless the voting userbase is highly educated and anti-fragile. Setting the bar so high (95% activation rate) is a fools errand.
There will always be enough gullible and stupid people to make up the 6% to be coopted by malicious actors to prevent positive change. There will always be enough rich people with strong ideology opposite to the majority consensus who are willing to bribe enough people to reach that 6%. What does it matter if miners have an economic incentive when you make the bar so high that it creates a small enough window for personal bribery? They can get their economic incentive easily from the oppositions bribes.
Can you imagine if democracy required 95% voting to enact change? It would be like Spain, right now. They cant even get a government going because no one can agree. The same thing is going to happen to bitcoin if core keeps this 95% insanity going on forever.....

No, not at all. Im not a statist but I also recognize the utility of socially funded programs like Fire Fighters, Police, etc. In other countries there is much better handling of the duties of public servants and their actions towards the public.
Here in the USA we have severe problems with backwards mentality and dinosaurs in office that are dead set on doing everything the wrong way.
Supporting those factions and those actions is morally wrong.

"Smart money" bought bitcoin when it was $200-300. Its very difficult to rationalize "smart money is coming into bitcoin" when clearly we passed that stage 2 years ago.
Institutional investors...yes. How many institutional investors were buying right up until the dot com bubble or 2007 financial crisis bubble bursted?
Just because people with money are buying does not mean we are not nearing the end of a bubble. There are always bag holders and they range from the average joe to institutional investors. Everyone is susceptible to psychology which is exactly the reason bubbles exist to begin with.

Nor is it a solution for those of us who want nothing to do with touching the TOR network. Call me paranoid, but I dont need to taint my connection with that.

You cannot defeat ideology. Entrenchment must be reversed by those who are respected within their peer group and you were obviously a outsider to them.
Our only hope to sway the tide is to convince the more trusted individuals to reverse their position.

Some things to note about this poll. Its a **sybil-resistant** poll, so *your identity must be verified in order for it to be sybil-resistant*.  Here are the permissions it needs -










Yes, this means that the application will get info from your **public profile** on coinbase. Key word there - Public. Not private. So this does not intrude upon your private information.
The payment method limits are to ensure that you are over the *verified* threshold. If you are not verified, then your vote does not count because again, this is a sybil-resistant poll that is purposefully constructed to prevent sock puppets from skewing the results.
For those who will cry "this is biased!", how are you going to try and rationalize that coinbase is a small block playground? The CEO is a loud vocal big blocker and has not held back broadcasting his opinions on the matter. If anything coinbase is clearly biased towards big blocks considering their history supporting consensus-breaking reference clients that failed at adoption.
A quick google search turned up the places that the URL has been posted. 
Some google searching showed me various places it was posted. 
even people posting it on zerohedge comments lol -
The greater point is - Nothing is stopping you from posting this poll on all the places you visit. Anyone who has a coinbase account can login and do the poll. I strongly encourage every one of you to spread this link to your friends, family, bitcoin social media accounts and the like.
Without a broad sampling this poll wont be accurate.
However, looking at the social media questionaire section it appears that there is a equal sampling of people that read and those who read the bitcointalk forums.
Its kind of hard to claim the poll is biased when the polling is placed on neutral grounds and anyone can post the URL anywhere they please.
There is no censorship whatsoever that you can cry about. That card has been dealt too many times and no one is scared of the wolf anymore.
Holy shit on the POW change portion. More than 50% support a POW change if miners attempt to block BIP148! If that doesn't have Jihan shitting his britches then he's less intelligent than I thought.
Looks like about 90% of participants want to use SW themselves, and 95-97% are totally fine with others using it.
It appears that about 65% of participants are OK with a HF so long as there is ecosystem wide consensus. I think thats pretty conservative with the consensus qualifier. 
About 60% flat out oppose a blocksize increase HF. Holy smokes not good for the BCC fanboys. The next question is good, because it gives you a indication of the mentality by asking whether you *ever* support a BS increase with a HF, in which about 70% responded in support of "sometime in the future" upgrading BS with HF. Good info!
Looks like only about 10% believes there should be a unbounded blocksize. Frankly more than I thought! I would have guessed 5%. And about 25% believe it should be dynamic.

First, your statement reflects that you have done zero research on the topic, yet here you are making strong statements as if you are a expert on the topic. Doesn't that bother you even just a little?
Secondly, the effect is a long term detrimental effect upon centralization. If only some pools are using it it allows a unfair advantage by cheating the proof of work. The entire point of a proof of work is that you actually prove that you did the work. If you didn't actually do the work but you say you did the work and you cheat (such as falsely filling out your timecard at your work place), you are disadvantaging the network while advantaging yourself.
Bitcoin's largest problem is has and will always be mining centralization. The consolidation of too much power into individual hands is the destruction of the network. It allows one or multiple individuals to collude or to get hacked and some security breach in which they can then unleash catastrophic damage to the network. We've already seen what damage they could do to the developmental progress of Bitcoin over the last year-and-a-half, it's really mind-blowing to me that after watching the situation and fold beneath everyone's eyes that we can still pretend that what happened didn't happen.
This isn't fear-mongering this is the threat that Bitcoin has faced since the white paper was released. The only problem here is that you're lacking education on how this process works and on the game theory behind this industry. 
I see this mentality perpetuated a lot. It's this clear demonstration of not understanding how the system works and then putting that ignorance on display for everyone trying to reason out common sense scenarios that only makes sense if you don't understand how the system works.
And the greater problem is is that these problems are complex and it takes a lot of time and education to understand the system. You get enough people like you in a room(or subreddit) and the dunning-kruger effect kicks in and then you all think your experts on the subject and then you all spread out to your mini societies and start spreading that misinformation that you all think you're so sure of.
I like that you asked a question in the first sentence. I didn't like that you made a concrete statement As your finishing sentence. Next time just ask the open-ended question without making the assumption as all you're doing is putting your ignorance on display and then making a claim right afterwards as if we should trust your viewpoint.
If only overt asicboost was the possibility then the playing field would at least be even and it would not lead to more centralization effects. But that would still not take away the fact that it encourages detrimental Behavior to the network. It's not cool to mine empty blocks. I understand that miners can do this and that they have the power to do this and it's their choice but to go far as to encourage this behavior is to encourage negative actions upon the network.
Why would we want to encourage shooting ourselves in the foot? I think the only solution is to kill asicboost in every single form possible. If you want to keep the network healthy then you need to keep the network Fair, it is really as simple as that.
The entire point of Satoshi using sha-256 as the proof of work was to prevent Asics from being created. The whole reason from preventing Asics from being created was to not diminish the concept of one CPU equals one vote. Once you diminish the one CPU one vote then you have centralization effects. Once you have centralization effects then you lose your decentralized properties.
If you can accept that form of logic then you can certainly accept eliminating asicboost to keep the playing field level.
I do agree with you that the creation of Asics has been the most detrimental thing to bitcoin. But it's also something that in hindsight could not have been prevented so instead of crying over spilt milk we need to focus on the reality we face now and the solutions for it.

You've failed to understand the technology, the aims, the goals, the progress and the future.
I've spent years studying bitcoin to come to the understand that I have. Whats your technology background and how much time have you spent evaluating the technologies capabilities, limitations and potential growth?
You are making the classic mistake of assuming everything is black and white. The world is not black and white, and neither is bitcoin. I cannot explain to you in a quick summary why blockstream has a financial incentive to see *bitcoin* progress, you will have to study the industry and evaluate the information that took me years to understand.
The most important thing to remember is that bitcoin is a protocol, and blockstream is creating layers above the protocol. They have not, will not, and do not "cripple" it in any way. They enhance it.
[Perhaps reading Adam Back's scaling roadmap]( will help you see the vision. I doubt it will though, as you seem to live in this fantasy world of black and white and dont seem to understand the complexity of the situation.
Perhaps knowing [Adam Back is the creator of Hash-Cash, the proof of work system bitcoin is built upon]( will help you understand the level of brilliance this man has.
Perhaps [Knowing he is a Cypherpunk, and even in their wiki]( and learning about the Cypherpunks will ease your insane conspiracy theorist agenda. Here is his entry in the Cypherpunk entry on wiki -


Cypherpunks encouraged civil disobedience, in particular US law on the export of cryptography. Until 1996, cryptographic code was legally a munition, and until 2000 export required a permit.


I cannot change your mind with a few words. But you obviously have a *lot* of learning to do and you are too hasty to draw lines in the sand when you clearly have a limited understanding of the nature of sand, or lines.
Good luck to you, I hope you choose education and research over conspiracy theories and allegations. There are few people I can think of less suited to run bitcoin than Adam Back. From a political, social and technological standpoint.

No, we are well past the "Media Attention" phase. Have you ignored all of the random people on the internet who the bitcoin community previously had never heard of suddenly declaring how they just purchased tons of bitcoins? Or all the exposure in national media in the last 3 days?
And are you also ignoring the near 200% gains in the last 30 days?
Only delusion would make someone think we are in the bear trap phase. You would have to ignore all indicators and facts to believe that.
When people you've never heard of but are internet celebrities start posting on twitter how rich they are going to be because of all the bitcoin they just bought at $2500 when bitcoin was like 1,100 30 days ago.....
Thats Greed/Delusion phase.
Now we just went from $2800 to $2300 in 1 hour. We are currently sitting in the bull trap.
But its no problem, time will show who's right. I'll buy you a beer if im wrong. And on the real, I do hope im wrong, because if I am wrong that means we are hitting 5k and thats just insane. That would mean bitcoins upside potential short term (5-10 years) is the 25-50k possibility range. If we can 5x the range on this bubble from the last bubble, then we can repeat the next time and the time after that. We will have many more bubbles!
Also, if we are in bull trap then you should wait for the "Return to Normal" phase before selling. There should be a few days of stability and order books looking pretty solid before Fear sets in. No one should panic sell. There's always a rebound after the first dip!

Neither do Core dev's, which is why they offered a 4MB blocksize upgrade. Or are you ignoring this fact? Another fun fact is you can fit about 2x the amount of SW transactions in the same space so a 4MB SW blocksize upgrade is equal to a 8MB regular blocksize upgrade.

There's a rabbit hole of finger pointing inception style and I think the buck stops ultimately with Gavin. I can think of no other person who holds more responsibility creating this ideology that was able to boostrap 8 figure chinese mining cartels ability to create such havok within the community.
Its not even about Gavin's intentions (which I believe were honest if naive), its about the fact that it created a faction by splitting the community, and then the ideological preferences of that faction could not be hijacked and used to further business gains.
I dont want to piss off a ton of people, so I wont name specific political parties here, but one party has clearly been hijacked by industry and used identity politics to further their business models by hijacking that specific parties ideological preferences. And while that argument goes to both sides of the aisle, its like a 80/20 when I look at the bigger picture.

Nice cognitive dissonance there Jeff. Are you seriously going to try and claim that Jihan did not block segwit for the last year? And are you also going to try to claim that bitmain is not funding development for competing consensus breaking clients? Are you also denying that covert asicboost exists, even after we found configurations on Jihans pool specifically so that users could use cover asicboost with their bitmain hardware? Are we also going to pretend that segwit does not mostly-break covert asicboost?
This denialism of obvious facts is exactly why I will never advocate for any software that you produce. You are clearly compromised. Even if you were not compromised you would have to be the dumbest moron on the planet to ignore these facts and not draw the common sense conclusion. I don't think you are stupid so I have to assume that you are instead compromised. Though you do run a coin analytics company so I think it's pretty obvious that you are just compromised and don't care about decentralisation.

ITT -
FUD Pundits coming out the woodworks screaming about blocksize increases NOW!
Meanwhile, every person who paid an appropriate fee is getting their transaction confirmed.  According to [bitcoinfees.21.co]( current fee rates are 240 sat/byte. I've watched bitcoin sit at 220 sat/byte for pretty much the last 2 months straight.
So yes, there is a 10% increase in current fee rates.
If you look at this chart, and zoom out until it says 1/1 on the left, it will give you a much better idea exactly how much fee's have risen over the last 2 months....
Which is to say, *not much*. So today is not very much different from yesterday, or the day before, or the day before that, etc etc.
The only difference now is likely a well timed spam attack that is skyrocketing unconfirmed tx's. YET, its having very little effect on the price. Reload the page and zoom out to 1 week and you'll see that its pretty much flat.
And you can still get your tx confirmed by block 10 for 160 sat/byte. 
But yes, we do need SW which **is a bigger block**. It would be the height of retardation to throw away all of the work that has been done optimizing bitcoin to fit more transactions into a block just because you dont understand those optimizations. A regular blocksize increase has none of those optimizations.
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:50:53


Thats the point. None of the concern trolls are saying this. Its the exact opposite. The same concern trolls that are saying that bitcoin is broke, on fire, dying, etc are the same ones that are apologists or protectionists towards Bitmain.
This is all ideologically driven. Those who want BU/Classic/XT see bitcoin as "dying" and "needs to be revived". It is not dying and changing the blocksize parameter is not going to "heal" it. They therefore attack bitcoin incessantly to try to "prove" that its "dying" when in reality its doing fucking great. The network has remained resilient against attacks and the more spam attacks that occur the more that we see the smoke and the more that they pointlessly burn their money. Gee, I wonder who has a ton of btc to waste thats been confirmed blowing it on supporting alternative client implementations and also claims bitcoin is "dying" ? I doubt that person could be behind the spam attacks though, that would make no sense! /s


I think the initial price raise was yes, but the steam thats been building is nothing to do with that. What you are stipulating is impossible. No one can arbitrage 100's of millions of dollars this quickly. I would speculate less than 3% of the markets value is from taiwanese arbitrage right now.
Pointing out the fact that bitcoins most major threat is mining centralization is not concern trolling. Thats a documented concern that has existed since the launch of bitcoin.

Are we really complaining about "policies" when everyones privacy and bitcoins fungibility is at stake?
We are talking about a single developer trying to take control of a 40 billion dollar network through his repository funded by a single mining monopoly assigning **by fucking default** the dns seeds to his chain analytics company.
Dude...what the fuck. Why are you even trying to fight for this? Does this really not bug you in any way?
That a lead developer is running a anti-privacy company that economically benefits off constraining privacy on the bitcoin network?
I used to be a loud supporter of Garzik. Holy shit i was wrong. This guy has demonstrated extensively over the last few months he is not to be trusted with the repository. He's a far cry better than BU sure, but why are we even considering this as a option when we have a fully decentralized team of leaders in the space working on the best implementation? Instead we are going to vote against our own best interest to allow industry to forcibly take control? Fuck no, not on my watch.

Talk of permissioned ledgers aside, I believe the hurdle we have to solve prior to this is a liquidity issue. If *banks* of all businesses start using the bitcoin rails then we are going to suffer a massive price drop without the liquidity to back it up.
To me the only solution to this is LN with exchanges sharing their order books with one another so that we can have pooled liquidity. Its just not possible right now with 10+ min confirmation times and all the double spend vectors, the exchanges would get raped dry.
But with LN in place they could do instant trades across the order books setup with little risk.

Last time I checked bitcoin is a decentralized system and no one can force a hardfork. Luke released his hardfork code as promised for the HK agreement. Core did not sign the HK agreement.

It's not meant to imply that those who are crying doom are wrong just that when you look at it from a larger point of you considering that climate change is real and the dangers that we face that when faced with both of those scenarios that the more dangerous scenario is complacency.
Fatalism is absolutely a issue with negative repercussions because it's not good to only focus on the negative when we do need to have positive conversations about the progress and path forward on how to resolve climate change.

Lets analyze this theory. In order for me to be targeting you, I would have to actually be following your posts right? Which would mean that if we went through your history we would see me following your posts around and commenting on all of them. Thats what "targetted" means in this context.
If its just organic happenstance, (as it is), then what we would find would be a history of you posting a lot, and very little activity in which I've commented on. You would also find a lot of activity on my end which is not related to you.
i just went a month back through my comment replies and I cannot find a single other instance of me responding to you. Nice "targetted harassment" there.
Now, I find this interesting because you think that I actually care enough about vile shitposters to follow them around and harass them? Dude, you are the slime on the edge of a gutter. I could give two shits about your posts in general. I also find it hilarious that you think that just because I know your reddit username and call you out that its "targetted harassment".
If I see you on the streets doing stupid shit and I remember your face and call you out for doing stupid shit, thats not "targetted harassment", thats just me seeing some stupid person doing stupid shit and calling them out for their stupid shit.
What I do care about is when you come over to this sub on a break from your echo chamber and try to spread misinformation and propaganda.
So I shut you the fuck down when you start talking your nonsense.
Thats not "targeted harassment", that's called dealing with stupid people on the internet.

I think the elephant in the room that no one talks about here is "drugs". People who need drugs are going to be willing to pay an extremely high premium for their drugs. This includes both illegal and legal drugs that are distributed via bitcoin.
I've not done any concrete research, but I think its widely accepted that drug markets take a pretty decent share of the pie of bitcoin usage. So as long as they continue to take a large slice of the pie, fee rates will continue to rise. The more people that use bitcoin for drugs the more fee pressure there will be.

This is provably false and a erroneous assumption. Node count has not linearly increased with the expansion of Bitcoin users. The system has rapidly become more centralized as more are onboarded with less resources per capita.
You have this "let's double down" theory that is insane. If node count hasn't increased linearly with growth why on Earth would you assume it will with more?
Something something definition of insanity something repeat something different result.
I'm tired of seeing this ignorant theory thrown around as if it is true when not only is it a shitty theory but one that is easily disproved if you research the facts for more than 5 minutes....

Also, if you are attempting to engage in a economic action that you know *can never be completed* then I do not think that its rational to categorize that as economic activity.
If you are trying to spend childs of a unconfirmed parent with a high fee, then you are not creating economic activity. You are merely creating the illusion of economic activity. If this illusion is then used to skew fee data then that can only be rationally explained as a malicious attack and **not** viable economic activity.

I am not and im on the record extensively stating that without the economic majority (exchanges, wallets, fiat bridges) being on board, then its likely it wont work.

I would disagree especially since the authors of this particular study specifically state that it is RAM that is the bottleneck. [I've posted this study a million times on this sub]( .
's request sounds reasonable until you understand that its the same old hardware running nodes today as it was 2 years ago. Bitcoin needs to run on extremely low spec pc's in order for the system to stay decentralized.
And it takes a *long* time for consumer hardware costs to decrease and trickle down to very low socioeconomic players like those in 3rd world countries.
If bitcoin is to retain its censorship resistence, then it must be able to be ran on "consumer" hardware in poor countries. So many ignorant people here post thinking with their American or European mentalities where they get paid 100x what people do in other countries and can afford new hardware.
Its not about affording new hardware, its about what hardware can trickle into the hands of extremely poverish nations.
I find it hilarious that the big blocker/fast adoption side constantly argues about how poor people are "priced out" and then on the other side of their lips they quote satoshi talking about server farms and are totally cool with $20,000 nodes.
Cognitive dissonance 101.

This thread is filled with stupid. Bitcoins greatest threat has and will always be centralization. This is a coup attempt and changes for politicians should be resisted with every ounce of breath we have.
The lack of foresight **and** hindsight is staggering here sometimes. Do you people not understand the context of precedents being set by industry and monopolies? This is the wearing down of protections, whttling away the concepts that make Bitcoin valuable.
Bitcoin does not need a hard fork. That is the simple answer. This is a reckless attempt to hard fork to appease egos and nothing more.
We are seriously supposed to cheer the industry as it fucks us?
This has little to do with the free market and everything to do with central actors trying to force changes upon everyone. SW has 90% ecosystem approval. That should be implemented. A HF does not, that should not.
Resistance to contentious change is incredibly valuable. Cheering the destruction of that is stupid.

The Assumption in the white paper is also that one CPU equals one vote. In the Advent of mining manufacturing monopolies in which one individual controls 75% of Hardware production and 40% of the hashrate do you really think that that is the case anymore?
Bitcoin has evolved from where it was when the white paper was written and everyone continuing to make assumptions as if nothing has evolved is part of the problem in these communities.
I think it's pretty obvious that the system is broken and that the trustlessness that the white paper was describing is now mostly gone. I hope that with the slowdown of Moore's Law and manufacturing that we will start to see some diversity in the mining playing field and that over time it will even out but that is yet to be seen and it is only a hope. I think given enough time it's possible that it will happen but also given enough power consolidation by current monopolies they can certainly prevent that and throw a lot of sand in the gears. 
We can already see the sand being thrown in the gears with the blocking of bit 141 over the last year and now Bitmain single-handedly funding developmental teams to try to monopolize development as well.

Past performance does not guarantee future performance. Its not nearly as hard to buy or sell bitcoin as it was in 2013 and peoples access to markets being more fluid means more fluid changes in the phases.
Also, we cannot recreate the conditions of 2013. We had a single exchange that was heavily manipulated (willy bot). There were all sorts of funky supply/demand constraints being artificially manipulated in that environment and we do not suffer from any of those problems anymore.

Moore's law will allow for increased efficiency of technology within the network. So as the block size scales up (which it will, which will then nullify your point) the technology scales with it at no greater cost and the same (likely greater) efficiency.
Its semantics now, but anyone who understands the technical limitations in place understands that there's nothing really more than politics holding back the block size at this point.

I wonder if btc-e's assets are going to be frozen somehow? Also, doesn't seem coincedental that btc-e went down the same time as his  arrest?
Doesn't that directly imply that he was running btc-e?
If he was, I wonder what his emergency failsafe plans were. Does he have other admins that are going to run the site now? Was he so crucial to the operation that btc-e will shut down now?
These are some incredibly interesting times. This must be really exciting for those Mt Gox creditors who have been patiently waiting for their funds back.

Not nearly as many nodes as people however. Think of the onboarding population at coinbase for a reference. 400k users in one month??
If we assume 1% of those users need to run nodes to keep the network strong, then thats 4,000 people who didn't run nodes when we need it.
I sincerely doubt "many others did". Its also besides the point. The network resources needs to remain low so that poverish nationals can contribute to the network. Thats how you stay decentralized. And we need every bit we can get since we've strongly centralized over the years....

We were not discussing a 51% attack, we were discussing the comparison of carbon emissions and network efficiency between btc and traditional banking sector.
As the technology becomes more powerful/efficient (Moores Law) then there will be (arguably) less energy necessary to secure the network, while at the same time the network benefits with greater power, enabling it to operate at higher efficiencies, which include but are NOT limited to increasing block size.
Do you understand now?

Made my head hurt a little bit thinking about this as there are multiple layers here, but I see this now. We would then have 3 bitcoins. Legacy, BIP148 and whatever HF from legacy is called. New HF coin and BIP148 would not suffer reorgs, but legacy still would.

My personal computer, which is likely a cookie to hack for a state actor, has lots of private stuffs. Rule 41? Or are you ignorant of this? That means that any computer connected to my modem that touches an anonymizing has a legal route to be hacked by government agencies.

Seems to me that despite no attention to bitcoin being made in the media, really how efficient would bitcoin be at laundering this money?
The problem is that these guys stole A SHITTON of money. Getting the money is the hard part. They can setup fraudulent accounts, but there is a limit to how much physical currency they can get. So they have to resort to other methods. Perhaps buying gold via wire? Making commodity purchases through bank wire etc would be another way of 'cashing out' on their heist, aside from controlling random ATM's to dispense cash.
They could setup bitcoin exchange accounts using their fradulent accounts and could seamlessly buy 100's of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin. They could then tumble the bitcoin, and have it go back into *legitimate* accounts, severing the link between the fraudulent accounts and the accounts receiving cold hard money through selling the bitcoin.
So, mentioned or not, bitcoin seems like a pretty capable financial instrument that could be used to cash out their stolen monies.

Ahh, now it makes sense. You dont understand bitcoin. Its ok, I see this naivety expressed often. SW gained support amongst 90% of the ecosystem.
You seem to be confusing miners with the entire bitcoin ecosystem.  While this is not perfect, its much better than your naive black and white assumptions -
Currently 87% of the ecosystem supports SW. Do not confuse an entire ecosystem with a single individual who is running a mining cartel.

Sorry, but I'm still not getting it. I never saw a single relayed tx prior to this year, and now all are being retained. Again, purely coincidence?
Either this behavior is having unexpected consequences, or there is an active attack of relaying ALL tx's. If it's the latter, you should really be researching it and presenting evidence so the community can hold those responsible.
You can attempt to rationalize the technicalities but you cannot ignore the evidence. Transactions that previously fell out of mempool after 72 hours are now being held indefinitely. So either the changed behavior is resulting in the new dynamic or someone is relaying ALL tx's as a new form of an attack.
Being in denial about the facts does not help anyone.

Sorry, I dont smoke shit that makes me delusional. I live in a real world where context matters. 
Maybe you would like to believe that its merely a coincidence that the lead maintainer of the repo has his coin analytics site put in as a default seed, but im not that stupid.


No, this is the place for debate. This is the place where people go to for information. How many people are going to read that PR vs here? We are going to get **THOUSANDS** of more people aware of this bullshit than we would if we took your advice.
Sorry but no, bitcoin is a social network of interconnected humans around the world and this happens to be a great place for awareness.
I reject your bullshit.
Its not character assassination to point out facts. Did I say jeff is a bad person? NO. I merely said he is engaged in an enormous conflict of interest. Stop being such a sensitive little baby and start recognizing that we are being attacked and if we dont respond then the coup will be successful.
This **is a coup** and im not going to pretend its not. Fuck your PR garbage.
Your advice is basically to "push this under the rug out of the publics eyes" which is strongly anti-bitcoiner. Bitcoin is a open and transparent process and your attempt to sweep this unfortunate little fact under the rug only points to you being compromised.
Public pressure is what gets shit done and if you think otherwise then you are lying to yourself or lying to us. This is the right place to discuss this issue.

Anyone who believes that america is a *free market* is naive at best. Clearly those with the most money win by subverting the legal process through lobbying, so assuming that this issue would just "fix itself" without regulation is again, *naive at best*. 
You cant put the genie back in the bottle. Our country is fucked and unfortunately the only way we can prevent the industry from raping the common man is by putting laws between that industry and the common man. THAT is why *government regulation is great!* (in this instance).

The same thing that has *always* prevented them from raising prices and reducing speed overall: Competition in the market.

You should have supported SW a year ago and helped activate it so that we wouldn't be in this fucking mess in the first place.
A HF BS increase was never a option. It still to this day does not fix cpu ddos. Were we to really implement a change that could immediately be used as an attack vector against the entire network?
Better late than never I suppose, but you can get the fuck outta here with that terrorist negotiation bullshit.
There will be no HF until there has been ample time to evaluate requirements and needs post SW activation.
Once safety is determined then a HF can be proposed.

I didn't say that was the solution, merely the problem. I think we are better off engaging in grass roots movements and effective communication to industry members. We as participants must let our servicors know that if they fork they will loose our business.
We also need software developers to show a united front. Wallet developers, app developers etc, need to show that the people who make this all possible wont be pushed down by industry.

This is also my perspective. BIP148 is simply a game of chicken and its a political tool. I've advocated running BIP148 nodes because I think it adds to that political clout, but I've always stated that without economic support from exchanges, fiat bridges and wallets that it really cannot stand on its own legs. shaolinfry stated this when he released it and this sub has ignored this context from day one.
I also find it funny I constantly have brigaders from rbtc trolling my posts "calling me out" for my BIP148 support when I've actually been mostly against it. 
Its like the bernie or bust situation. You dont *really* want the bust part, you just want the bernie part, just like BIP148 advocates want SW and they really dont want the bust/chainsplit part.
So they are very loud and vocal (like rbtc/BU/Classic/e'rthang) about their passion and support. This puts political and psychological pressure upon miners to hopefully make the right choice.
At the end of it, I have stated many times that you should not run a economic node enforcing BIP148 come august 1st unless there is support. There is clearly no support so I dont see any reason to put your or your customers funds at risk.

It was highly relevant. She was stating that she understands how a central actor can enforce rules and the context was *how that can be abused*(aka by the mob). The previous thing that was said was how the Venezuelan government abused it's position as a central authority over it's monetary system.

Much better response, hopefully the info in my previous two posts will settle into your consciousness and stick.








So it will start enforcing 4th of July, 2018. A symbolic day for freedom. I approve. That is assuming that we cannot get miners to activate it before then (which probably wont happen), but still allows for miner activation as an option.

Because chinese miners are prideful and got all butt hurt when a few core dev's signed a agreement at HK and couldn't convince the rest of the community to adopt their change.
So they rejected anything from that group regardless of how good it was for the network.
Then, when enough suits got together and decided to fund a different dev to take Core's hard work and implement it with some changes that they preferred from day one, the answer was easy enough. They will support this plan.

Im not doing anything. What would other people do? Continue to use bitcoin as they see fit. They can choose to pay 10 sat/byte and let it clear whenever they see fit and can RBF if they really need to bump for urgency.


And who's fault is that? If your merchant doesn't accept SW/LN then you will find a merchant who does. Thats like having a mastercard and going to a retailer that only accepts visa. You'll just go to the store across the street that accepts your mastercard, and you'll inform the first they lost your business because they cannot comply.
This is part of market mechanics at a B2B level. I also completely reject your *opinion* that its not a valid response. Maybe you should be a better consumer? Actually do more than bitch and moan on reddit, you could ...you know *gasp* ....speak to people! Tell them you think they should intergrate SW and LN if they want to keep your business. But that would require actual real conversation! Oh noes.
However most people who regularly use bitcoin have now understood the benefits of LN. Average bitcoin users will simply top up their LN while there is dirt cheap transactions, and *if* things get a little expensive moving foward, then they can use LN.
Bitcoin never had a chance at accomplishing its intended goals in its original form. You cannot be "good, fast and cheap", you must choose 2 and then design around the missing one with lower (2nd layer) technology.
For bitcoin its "Secure Fast Cheap". Choose 2. Since you loose security and never gain it back, you *must* choose that as  priority.  You loose cheap when you make it fast.
Fortunately LN solves the fast-cheap situation, and works as intended at sub-satoshi levels to boot.
You can still make your large purchases with btc, and have your spending cash (like cash in your wallet when you go shopping) on LN. You don't keep your entire savings with you right? Most people have a savings and a checking. BTC = Savings, LN = Checking.


They are *already* wrong. Think whatever you want, no words will change your mind. I don't know why you waste your time here pestering us with your bullshit.
Do you go to feminists meetings and shove your chauvinism in their faces? No? Good, then GTFO. The doors right there, feel free to use it. No one's forcing you to use bitcoin, but for the love of all things holy leave us alone. That battle ended with your shitcoins, go use them to your hearts desire.

Unzipped his pants and proceeded to piss directly on him while he was sleeping in bed.
The father woke up pretty quickly and started screaming my friend ran away and disappeared for the night.
It was probably the most awkward situation ever when he came back the next day and sat down for dinner with them. The father wasn't really angry he was just really disturbed by what had happened.

Maybe could fill us in on the details of where it was all posted that he saw, but I know that the poll was given to all sides of the spectrum to vote.
I might also point out that coinbases CEO, Brian Armstrong is a well known big blocker advocate and is vocal about his opinions. So any cries of bias are going to fall on deaf ears. If anything I would think that coinbase customers would default to their CEO's preference if they had none, which should give a slight edge to the big blockers ideological stance on this poll. 
Some google searching showed me various places it was posted. Something you could have done in 10 seconds yourself of course -
even people posting it on zerohedge comments lol -
The greater point is - Nothing is stopping you from posting this poll on all the places you visit. Anyone who has a coinbase account can login and do the poll.
So what are you waiting for? Dont claim bias, just spread awareness.

The DOJ indictment states that Alex was in control of administrative accounts. We know now that the DOJ has the BTC-E server, databases, "purse" (hot wallet?)....
So we can assume that when the DOJ says "Alex had administrative accounts" they can prove it since they are in possession of the databases.
Also, BTC-E has a direct (and very large) incentive to disprove this theory as if Alex was a employee of btc-e and was using it as a personal money laundering business, then btc-e would be liable for Alex's actions. So of course they are going to say Alex was not an employee. 
Also, are we to ignore than Alex was the director of CANTON, the parent company of BTC-E? How does that fact work into your cognitive dissonance? How does your mind rationalize that fact and explain it away?
Occam's Razor would directly imply that Alex was an administrator of BTC-E. But I think we dont need to resort to such things when we have a pile of evidence that demonstrates clearly that Alex was at least very high up on the chain of command in regards to BTC-E. Why else would he be the director of CANTON, BTC-E's holding corp? The only thing you could rationally argue at this point was that Alex was the "fall guy" and that the real owner is still at large. But that still directly links Alex to the BTC-E operation. You dont get to be the fall guy without massive benefits, at least part ownership or major shareholdings of investment dividends.

But I'm not confused right? Once segwit is activated then that bit will no longer be used and could subjectively be used for a difference upgrade?
I understand Peter Tod's request for better specification especially when you are dealing with an open source project. That makes sense.
But complaining about a bit that is quite obviously going to not be used at that point does feel like semantics to me since it's clear at this point that SW is going to get activated. But looking in the past if this complaint was voiced in the beginning when we are unsure whether it would be activated or not I think that it was a reasonable point then.

Btw, wanted to say thanks for stepping up to the plate on this particular issue Charlie.
I do hope that you will eventually understand that a hard Fork is not the will of the users but instead the will of specialized interest groups within the industry.
Bitcoin was designed to prevent exactly these kinds of powerful factions from making decisions for the rest of the network. To apply a Jeff garzik-ish quote,  you are simply replacing the head priests with presidents and CEOs.
This path forward does not have consensus. You may think that industry heads running large companies who come together and sit in room and make a decision is consensus but I assure you it is not. The consensus for a engineered system is usually first reached by the engineer's on the technical path forward and then is debated on the social layer. It's not until the social layer and the technical layer both reach consensus that the ecosystem has chance at a clean nakamoto consensus. Ignore the engineers at your peril the same way that you should not be ignoring scientists over climate change.
I hope you will eventually see the light and realize that trying to force a hard Fork upon the industry will only create a chain split and partition yourself off taking a chunk of the economy with you. Maybe some people think that this is good but I'm not so positive. I think that we would be better United without all of the politicians posturing for power within the system. Maybe being united in a system that's already developed team colors and celebrities all going for power plays this is an impossible hope. I suppose that in the end this is really what the Nakamoto consensus is for to determine the final say when the social layer has failed.

I dont agree with this. Also, it is not their prerogative to prevent people from hardforking off bitcoin to change the rules to their liking. Core is not a team of tyranical dictators, they are open source engineers that are here to improve the bitcoin project.
Core cannot prevent this, so why would they try to fight it? That would be against the spirit of nakamoto consensus anyways. Anyone is welcome to attempt to change the rules and gain a following. yes, it sucks, yes there will be economic consequences by you are asking someone to move a mountain with their hands and that aint happening.
Secondly, they dont know there will be a split, or more importantly a split that matters. There is a chain split 1-2 times a day as blocks are found at the same time and propagated, with the next block found ultimately choosing the winner. But no one ever notices. If only a minority of the economy leaves, it will have little impact upon bitcoin. I am unsure whether this will be the case, but I am sure that post - SW activation we will have a **lot** more data to analyze to determine what the best path forward is.
I highly suspect that data will show us what we already know - That there is no reason whatsoever for a hardfork. You keep ignoring [mempool has dropped off the face of a cliff since the spam attacks have stopped]( and that without the mempool being full there is no fee pressure and without fee pressure the big blocker agenda falls to pieces.
There is no reason to HF and Core devs know this, I know this, most well educated and technical bitcoiners know this, and then we have a smaller portion of the ecosystem that wants to demand a increase for no reason whatsoever other than to satisfy the egos of a few miners.
You do not make hasty and resource impacting changes to the network for the egos of a few rich individuals. It astounds me that any bitcoiner could not see this clear as day and agree.


You think because a CEO of a company signs a piece of paper that it magically creates consensus? C'mon dude, you are smarter than that. CEO's do not represent the users. They represent themselves and their board of directors and they represent whats in their best interests of their profits. Miners do not represent the users.
Only users represent the users. You are a moderate user, yes. But you are a small minority [as sybil-resistant polling has shown that only about 10% believe a HF is appropriate right now](
That 10% will go down once we have even more clear data showing a smooth operating network.
You are a minority. Pretending you are majority will get you no where. You dont have the data to backup your position. I wipe my ass with the paper signed by CEO's. These suits making closed door room decisions do not represent **a decentralized global network**. Every single one of those CEO's could get fired today, and you know what would happen?
Bitcoin would continue on working fine without them. You need to acknowledge this basic fact and realize that these companies dont represent users. 
Only users represent users, and the best polling to date shows a completely different story.


Im talking about Roger Ver and his well publicized crusade and paid shillery,  and I think you know that.


You'll have to explain how a neutral poll posted everywhere is  "rubbish". if you want to make a argument as to why the sampling is inaccurate im open to hearing it, but considering that its a open source poll posted on github and spread in every social media platform possible its going to be hard for you to claim a biased narrative. 
I dont claim the science is on my side, I claim that the users are on bitcoin core's side. I think this is readily apparent by the fact that 95% of the deployed software is running bitcoin core. How do you think this btc1 HF is going to work out under those circumstances? I think if anything its going to be a fascinating social experiment and I will be glued to my seat for the results. I hope that users shut down the industry because otherwise its the hijacking of a decentralized network for centralized interests.


As the parent comment shows, this was the correct response -


Its a pretty commonly known fact that segwit will *almost* (1.7x) double transaction capacity once its fully adopted (yes, that will take time). So you can fit twice the current amount of legacy transactions in a 1mb SW block. So thats 4x for a 2mb block and 8x for a 4MB block. I understand thats best case scenarios and not real world usage, but its clearly advantageous over legacy transaction formats.
[Current projections are around 9k txs per SW block]( No, its not 15k, but its not too far off either and theres a lot of room to make that a reality with Schnorr. AFAICT, we should be edging right around 14-15k with schnorr + SW (not 2x).
Also, I have a bad habit of writing a comment, immediately re-reading it, correcting my mistakes, and then repeating this process 2-3 times. So if your quick on the reply you'll get errors I meant to erase. In this case I was researching and had many tabs opened and copied the wrong comment URL.

OK. So the reason I had deleted my above post is because I found contradictory info and didn't want to step on my own feet. I deleted it before I even saw your reply, sorry about that, not meaning to pull the rug out on you just didn't feel comfortable putting on paper something while I was having a moment of cognitive dissonance.
Here's what made me change my view ...


You were correct on this part. Clearly Satoshi framed the design so that *in the event that if* an imbalance should occur, that it would be resolved through market mechanisms. 


Yes, I agree with this. 


No, I didn't mean to imply I was a maximalist on the issue. I didn't intend every single human to only have one cpu, just that the hardware was meant to add financial friction to the situation as to allow for a greater chance of distribution.


Here we disagree. When I said specialized hardware I was referring to FPGA's and ASIC's. What satoshi is referring to here is standard computer equipment that deals with scaling normal resource usage, such as hard drive space, RAM, bandwith, etc. Two different topics.
So, in conclusion, I believe I was incorrect.
I may be aggressive, but I am not blind to reason. When I see something that counters my belief I am willing to shift my stance on it. I understand not very many people here will be willing to say "I was wrong", but I am not. I was wrong.
Sorry for the accusations. Clearly it was me who misunderstood the common truths.
I could not find any definitive statements from satoshi as to *why* he chose SHA256, but the common belief is just tried and tested standards, similar to why he chose ECDSA. So it would be incorrect for me to *assume* he chose it specifically for resistance to ASICs.
I dont see bitcoin in black and whites. I see it as multiple layers of decision making processes on a tree. I think that satoshi tried to design the system to be as fair as possible, but that in the event that imbalances occur that the market mechanisms resolve it.
What I disagree with are the assumptions of economic incentives that may have been true in 2009, but seem untrue now. 


I believe the introduction of covert asicboost skewed that incentive. I believe asicboost presents a clear scenario in which "playing against the rules" creates a greater economic incentive than playing *by* the rules. The entire premise of proof of work *is that you actually prove you did the work*. If you skip specific validation through cheating, you are bypassing the portion of proof of work that *proves you did the work*. If everyone cheats, then this is a non-issue. But with covert asicboost where it is just about impossible to prove when you cheat, this presents a clear danger to the rules of the system.
I also think that when bitcoin becomes big enough to threaten incumbent financial systems, then it becomes *economically rational* for the incumbents to waste economic resources attacking the system. 
And finally, all of this assumes rational actors. Understanding of human psychology demonstrates that rational actors behaving solely for economic reasons do not neccessarily dominate the market and non-economically based actors can have snowballing effects upon the market.
[Research has shown]( that people will often change the behavior not for economical reasons, but instead because of social reasons. "Fitting in" actually means **more** than "saving money". Cialdini has done multiple studies to demonstrate this effect, the most recent one being with solar panels. Whether its hotel towels, hangers on doors, or solar panel installations, every single study has shown that none of the reasons motivated people to change **except those reasons related to fitting into social groups**.
People are willing to adopt/change *if they think their peers do it*.
Im not saying there is a better way to do it than there currently is. I dont know how how to intergrate the social norm discovery process that psychologists have determined to exist and to make this piece fit into market based mechanisms so that we have a more fluid system.
But i am saying there are loopholes in the market philosophy and these loopholes have demonstratable effects.
Bitcoin has entered into the identity politics realm. We now have clear factions. This same thing has occured all over the world in societies in relation to climate change. What *was* merely technical arguments have been politically entrenched arguments that relate to identity. The rules of "If we just educate them on the facts" do not apply when dealing with identity politics.
Just like its no longer about facts in the bitcoin world, but instead about who's tribe you align with. 
This evolution of bitcoin from a mostly united social force into a divided group of factions shows that bitcoin is no longer a rational market that moves solely based on economic reasons.

We are arguing about two entirely different things. I agree that transactions submitted to the network regardless of price are viable economic activity.
What im saying is that we need to recognize when transactions are crafted **with no other purpose** other than to increase transactional costs for political gain.
Being aware of the facts is incredibly important because this has been used to manipulate the narrative for political gain.
Im not merely isolating this conversation in a vacuum of a purely economical discussion *like you are*.
I dont pretend I live in a vacuum. I understand that there is cause and effect beyond the edges of a particular category and that these situations bleed out and have system wide effects.
Yes, I have read books on economics, the most recent being Capital by Thomas Piketty. I dont claim to be a expert on economics or anything really, but I do have a good grasp on the social dynamics of systems and I can see a spade and call it a spade.
You however, are pretending that a spade is just a spade and that its not used for digging, or that it can be used for stabbing, or cutting cakes or whatever other million reasons a spade could be used for.

A very weak statement/argument. Someone who seems himself as such a brilliant entrepreneur should rationalize that bitcoin, a *global* commerce, does not care for the whim's of any specific state or authority. 
Does the Philippine family receiving remittance care that at one time, one tenth of one percent of that 1 bitcoin *may* have had some taint on what *might* have been a silk road transaction?
One of the strongest points of bitcoin is that it is non-censurable.

Remember that the people are always ultimately more powerful than the government that claims to represent them. This analogy holds true with industry and customers. Plenty of history to draw upon when CEO's make stupid decisions and tank the business because the customer base didn't agree.

Good line. When I explain bitcoin to people, the first thing I always say is "Bitcoin is democracy but for money. Its money *by* the people, *for* the people."
This helps people understand this monetary sovereignty concept from the get go, which is the most fundamentally important part of bitcoin. You are correct in that this is what creates so much more value for bitcoin over permissioned ledgers.
But I do not think that should be sold as 'forget about permissioned ledgers' as the elite all-powerful have decided that is the technology they are going to pursue, it *is* going to save them 10's if not 100's of billions of dollars annually once they start to replace their legacy systems.
Once they do this, then they can start removing fee's from ATM's and ridiculous overdraft fee's, etc. They can cut corners on their cost of operation and then by doing so be more competitive. Then the sheeple will start hating them less because they dont see the absorption of wealth occurring so directly. Its hard for the average person to understand inflation. 
Not only that, but with a interconnected banking infrastructure, it allows them to *print money* easier, as counter-party loans are going to be easier than ever for them. Once they start collecting data en masse and have a interconnected system where they can see more info faster than ever before, then it makes it easier for them to extend credit.
In short, the banks are struggling to keep their power and are now getting very competitive fearing this new threat and we have no idea how it will play out in the long run. As sad as it is, I think major financial crisis is the only real catalyst for bitcoin. Major system collapse. We know its coming we just dont know when. 
*"The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent"*
EDIT - To everyone complaining that 'bitcoin is not democratic' - What do you think the voting (mining) mechanism is? We the people get to choose the ruleset that is imposed. By a majority vote. Thats exactly what democracy is! Lets look at the definition:






The network is the government, and the rules are decided by the eligible members of state/whole population. You can choose to operate a node (vote) or mine (vote) on the rules you wish to enforce, or choose to *not* vote/participate. The majority of population that decides on the rulesets in this case determine the rules enforced by government.
The abstract here is that there are economic incentives, which then makes it a free market discussion as well. yet there are not economic incentives to run a node, and yet I run one, thereby casting my vote. Seems to me that it is a democratic version of money that is controlled by free market principals. Which is still democratic.

Funny how all the BU supporters were warned about this, and now research is proving its truth. The problem is that most of the participating members in this community simply abandon their username and flow with the wind as to what they think is the best path for bitcoin when their assumptions are proven reckless.
This demonstrates how important reputation is within a social community. People misunderstand bitcoin in that they become maximalists about the whole "code is law" theory, while ignoring the humanity of consensus systems.
I've written on this topic, [I think its time we have a discussion about pseudonymity, reputation networks, astroturfing, sock puppets, meritocracy and how we judge each others content here.](
And this research only highlights how important reputation systems are. All those people who supported BU? Where are they now? Shitposting about BitcoinABC under a different username. 
And where will they be when BitcoinABC collapses? Shitposting about whatever the new bigblocker fantasy repo is, *under a different username*.
Seriously fuck these people. If they are too cowardly to stand by their words, then why should their words hold weight in the debate? If you cannot engage in a meritocratic system in which your intelligence is judged through your words, then you should not be participating at all. Fucking cowards. Do not confuse this with privacy, pseudonymity retains your identity and maintains a reputation system. Thats the entire fucking point of reddit!

Because it is up to the miners to decide what is valuable, and what is not. Its a fundamental issue that cannot be overcome without resorting to some seriously questionable ethical decisions like "whitelisting/blacklisting" which is a shitsandwich no one wants to touch.
There are pros and con's for everything, and to run a distributed p2p network, this is one of those con's. Without a central authority to say "this good, this is bad" we have to rely on distributed broadcast mechanisms to figure things out.
@_date: 2016-05-28 21:10:43


I think more specifically the reason there was more demand than supply was due to Mt Gox being ~~the only exchange that people were using~~ combined with the fact that gox put a stop on withdrawls, which only encouraged users to purchase btc to get it out of the exchange, and you have a recipe for massive overvaluation of a asset through artificial controls.
Talk of the willy bot and other theories is pale in comparison to that solid fact alone. 
Fast forward to today, where we have many accredited and liquid exchanges operational, and you can see that for the first time ever, really, we have massive buying spree's across a distributed market. When the liquidity is so evenly spread across so many different marketplaces like this, its fascinating to see *real* price valuation in effect, even if its just speculation without any driving event.

Good. Then you are in no position to criticize the data. So please stop pretending that you are in that position by erecting strawmans discounting the research Laurent has done.


We have not been for a while. All I wanted to do was unravel your position to see how weak your position is. Now that you've finally approached the conversation with some honesty I can say that you are in no position to misrepresent the evidence presented.
The original discussion was about economics but that has played out already. There were no strawmans presented by me. We had a topic, we discussed it, it went into a tangent, we discussed the tangent, and now here we are finished.
For someone who claims to be a scientist you sure have a difficult time accepting basic scientific methodology, specifically that of eliminating bias. If big data / analytics is not your field then you should have never crawled onto the field and made any claims whatsoever since you are not educated on the topic at hand.
I dont claim to be. I never did and never will. So im unsure what these imagined strawmans are that you've erected, but I find it interesting that you are projecting your actions upon me.

First, describing a well documented cultural phenomenon is not an ad hominem attack. Secondly, yes, it absolutely is a "chinese pride" issue because chinese nationalism is different than say, Denmark Nationalism or Canada nationalism.
Yes, pride is pride, but you must understand the cultural implications to understand why the severity of the issue is so amplified like it is.
Are you american? If so, you should understand. I say "chinese pride" with the same disgust as I often say "American pride" because they are both the same thing. Usually its formed with **extreme racism** and an irrational emotional attachment to your identity even though there is little quality to back up the feeling.
Americans are often irrational prideful in the same way, bounded by cultural white heritage. Chinese are no different, they have the same extreme nationalistic pride that makes them dislike outsiders.
Do a quick [google search]( and read up on it. This is not some personal attack. Even though I think Jihan is worthy of personal attacks, this is a cultural issue and should be recognized for what it is. Its also important to recognize this issue because such a large portion of the industry exists inside china, so top down policy decisions must be formulated with this information in mind.
This is mostly about a chinese billionare being butthurt he cannot sustain his dominance over white western developers who feels he was slighted by the hong kong agreement. Anyone who thinks its much more beyond that does not see very clearly.

It's irrelevant. Either you don't understand how the Bitcoin network works or you are being purposefully naive on the subject.
Mempools empty which means that there are no transactional delays whatsoever for any transactions that are submitted to the network. If coinbase is trying to complain that there is congestion then they are lying.
There is no way that you could try to argue yourself out of the truth in this situation. That's what's so great about Bitcoin is that it's transparent to the public so we can see exactly what's going on so when people tell us b******* lies like we are getting fed from coinbase right now we can throw it in their face and say no these are b******* lies.
Is coinbase would have said "listen guys are cold wallet extraction process is very tedious and laborious and that is causing the delays" then we wouldn't be having this discussion right now.
But that's not what they said so don't try to argue it for them.

For what reason though? To push HF wish list items? None of them are so severe that we need to risk splitting the network on right now. They have **zero** reason to HF and they have been vocal about this fact.


First, lets not confuse industry with users. Sure, you can gather up a few suits in a room and get "consensus" from a industry perspective, but that is by no means any way to gauge the full ecosystem, which is comprised of *mostly users*. In fact, the best polling to date, done on a sybil resistent site (coinbase) -
Looks like only 10% of users agree there should be a hard fork. I might also add this is on a platform that is not even neutral. Brian Armstrong is a well known big blocker that shitposts his turd opinions frequently. I dont know where you are pulling these supposed supporters from, but I can only speculate its thin air. You will see that this is the case when they attempt to hard fork in November.
Secondly, it should tell you **a lot** about these industry members who are trying to push a agenda on the public when **there is no sound technical reasons behind the push**. I dont care who advocates for a BS increase, they've not done it with any valid technical reasoning that SW does not already accomplish *all on its own*. So you can take your CEO's of banks, fiat bridges and Mining monopolies and decide whatever you want, but fuck these people if they are trying to force something upon the entire network because they are too stupid or too emotional to acknowledge the underlying technical reasons behind software engineering a decentralized cryptocurrency.


What facts? Where is your data? Where is your proof? Just saying shit doesn't mean you are right. I've been on the ball for years in this industry and I've seen no data that supports your position. I've seen an enormous amount of social platform sock puppetry, propaganda and ideological entrenchment, but no real hard data that supports your viewpoint.
In fact, everything I've seen is actually the complete opposite of what you say, so yes its hard to have a reasonable discussion when one side refuses to use any data and instead asserts opinions as if they are fact. 


Its a pretty commonly known fact that segwit will *almost* (1.7x) double transaction capacity once its fully adopted (yes, that will take time). So you can fit twice the current amount of legacy transactions in a 1mb SW block. So thats 4x for a 2mb block and 8x for a 4MB block. I understand thats best case scenarios and not real world usage, but its clearly advantageous over legacy transaction formats.
[Current projections are around 9k txs per SW block]( No, its not 15k, but its not too far off either and theres a lot of room to make that a reality with Schnorr. AFAICT, we should be edging right around 14-15k with schnorr + SW (not 2x).

You missed the point.
Still doesn't take away that the primary purpose of BIP91 is to accelerate the activation of existing BIP141 clients. It has **absolutely nothing to do with the proposed hardfork**.
With the hard fork removed, what is Segwit2x? **Its just Segwit**.
So BIP91 is a great mechanism to get segwit activated. Which, it would be already, if it wasn't for obstructionists like you, Gavin, Roger and Jihan. 
Once its activated we will have plenty of time to analyze the market on usage, requirements, etc.
Have fun with your fork. I assure you all it will accomplish is splitting the community. A massive portion of the industry will reject your client and refuse to upgrade.

You seem to be unaware of the specifications and dates here. BIP91 is specifically to activate SegWit **for existing bip9( aka bip141 installs) deployments**.

Sooooooo...unless Hillard had a time machine BIP91 was intended for core. The intention of BIP91 is purely to accelerate the existing core deployed segwit installation.

You really think that the infrastructure has changed that much in 2 years? I think that in itself is pure conjection backed by nothing.
There is little evidene if any that the hardware topology map of the bitcoin network has changed very much. 
1.5 years go we were at 7k nodes. Now we are around 8.5k nodes.
You are really going to tell me that those 7k nodes have all upgraded and that we need a new study?
That is highly irrational. At best, a small portion of those existing nodes have upgraded. Would the metric really be all that different if say, 85% of the nodes were kicked off the network? Or 80%?
Its still a catastrophe and people like you who are trying to argue otherwise are denying water is wet.

I agree and see this scenario as mostly uncorrelated to the drop in tx volume. When one market disappears, I assume others take the tx share as users move. There might be a small suppression during a move, but it should even out pretty quickly.

Part of progress is making mistakes. If we do not slip up, we can never recover and become stronger in the process.
If we never grant those we trust that trust, then they never have a chance to betray us. 
Im not suggesting that Gavin betrayed us, but I am suggesting that he has failed in a way that is important to every single person in the community. There can be no doubt after all of this mayhem, CW is not Satoshi, Gavin got "bamboozled" and he has failed us with his trust.
I think this will be a wake up call for Gavin. I had a similar wake up call years ago, and I turned from a gullible optimists to a critical thinker. I realized that I was falling prey to to-good-to-be-true theories and living my life in a reality of false assumptions.
Maybe Gavin will become more resilient after this, question things more thoroughly, be more critical. 
His main failing is that he gives too much trust to humanity. This is a beautiful failing, so he should not be harshly criticized for it, but he *should not* have admin access to this project. He has proven conclusively that it would be irresponsible.
This is coming from a very very long time Gavin supporter. I still like the guy a lot, and really hope that he and garzik continue to contribute to bitcoin core. They are extremely talented developers who's input could be used in what is a very small team running a global experiment.
But most importantly? That contartist Craig Wright is not Satoshi, and all of his shills have been put out. The  JVP's of the world can go back to twitterland spreading their false gospel to the idiots, while we of reddit have been made stronger and smarter through this experience.

They are in practicality the same exact thing, using the same mechanism.

It opens up the network to additional attack vectors while it does nothing in terms of benefits. SW is a blocksize increase that fixes the attack vector and realigns utxo cost at the same time which will  add long term benefit to the network.
The HF is just a unnecessary risk for the sake of chinese miner's ego. I DGAF about chinese pride and it should have no place in a technical discussion.

Thats with 1MB. Now imagine if blocks took 6 minutes to verify instead of the milliseconds/seconds it currently takes. Maybe this is too much for your cognitive stream to take in, but the effects would be massive.

Not the bitcoins themselves no, but there is plenty of intrinsic value of the network. The energy used has value, the equipment used has value, the labor applied has value, etc. You took my statement out context and presented a strawman.
I dont disagree with you on the truth of intrinsic value of money, but context matters here.


Anyone who is trying to claim that bitcoin has not lost "some" of its market share to competitors is delusional. However, I dont think thats the context of this particular discussion.
The context here is that we've had big blockers spreading propaganda and misinformation claiming that the recent increase of fee's has resulted in large amounts of capital flight to competitors, and its that capital flight that has explained the drop in fee's (and not [research that proves it was spam](
This is most likely false. You cannot watch bitcoin hitting new ATH's, breaking new metrics and then on the other side of your mouth claim that there's enormous capital flight. Those two facts cannot co-exist without some cognitive dissonance, and that is not even considering [the wealth of data on the topic that proves inconclusively that there was indeed large coordinated spam attacks on the network who's purpose was only to inflate the price of fee's](

Why would they? I dont have the URL on hand, but there's a good spreadsheet that shows developer support for the various proposals and there isn't a single core dev that supports SegWit2x.
Why would they advocate for something that they specifically oppose?


Telling it like it is, is FUD? Why on earth do we need a hardfork? Are you ignoring the all time low mempool *before segwit is even activated* ?
All of this hardfork talk is complete nonsense. Why would we do such a risky thing when there is no technical reason for it?


I would much rather them continue to be conservative intelligent engineers that advocate for the safest and smartest path forward without introducing unnecessary changes to the system that increases risks.
We are getting our 4mb blocksize increase with segwit, which will hold 8x the transactions we currently have with a legacy 1mb blocksize with wide SW adoption, which is bound to happen considering the economic incentives involved.
Then we have Schnorr around the corner, LN ready to go. blocksizes will be a 3 year all time low by the end of 2018 with just SW activated and none of this hardfork nonsense.
Why on earth would we introduce new attack vectors to the bitcoin network **for no reason at all and for no advantages**?

Sorry but I strongly disagree and there is an enormous amount of historical context to prove my perspective. What gives USD value is our nation and its willingness to enforce its economical dominance through any means, but usually violence. The military is a trillion dollar resource that *backs* the non-intrinsic value of USD.
Its not about direct representation but instead about backing. It is the backing that creates the underlying value of an asset. 
You are attempting to handwaive away reality with your theoretical viewpoint. Some things dont have intrinsic value, but that does not mean that their valuation is not derrived from real tangible and non-tangible assets that absolutely do have valuation. Market driven price discovery, while is a excellent vehicle for this purpose, utilizes exactly this kind of backend fundamental valuations as part of the organic discovery process. The participants utilize this information when information gathering to make determinations on purchasing or selling decisions. This is an important part of valuation.


Strawman. Every country that has hyperinflation has it for various and complex reasons and the similarities of all of them is that they lack proper valuable resources to **back their currency**. This merely proves my point, that the value of the commodities (or things) backing a particular asset/network/etc is what determines the fundamental value of an asset.


No. I will call a spade a spade and you can pretend facts dont exist all you like, I wont stick my head in the sand.


Strawman. You are attacking twitter and ignoring the data. If you are incapable of processing the data its ok. You can admit it. But do not pretend that just because someone posts the research to twitter that it is invalidated. Sorry but this information is not intended for laypeople. If you are incapable of understanding the research then you will have to instead rely upon the experts. [The person who published this happens to be a 20 year data analytics professional]( so your "twitter" rant is unfounded. That is also a better article on the same data set so you cannot use the twitter excuse anymore even if it wasn't in itself already an irrational claim.
But dont strawman the situation and act like the data doesn't exist.


No, it cannot. Those two terms directly conflict in meaning. You cannot be both stunted and growing so rapidly that you hit ATH. Maybe you meant to imply something else, but what you just stated was illogical.


You seem reasonably intelligent and I have no intention of insulting your intelligence, but you've yet to demonstrate that you are above what you just stated I am doing. My last quote from you demonstrates this quite accurately I think.


If you claim to have the qualifications then you should not be attacking the cover of the book while ignoring the book. A real academic would look at the data and determine its flaws, regardless of which pre-print server the paper was submitted to.
Im well versed in academia and I understand how it works. You however, seem to be stipulating unneccessary requirements in an attempt to invalidate information that you appear at a glance to be incapable of interpreting.


Yes, I do write typo's from time to time, yes it was supposed to be conclusively not inconclusively. 
Yes, its speculation. But its data driven speculation. Fortunately for us, the data behind the speculation exists and can be reviewed.
Again, if you have a issue with the data, then you should take issue with the data. Dont attack twitter. The medium in which the information is delivered is irrelevant to the data.
Go ahead, prove to me that you are capable of analyzing the data. Show to me the flaws. If you cannot, then you should not presume to lecture anyone about "fostering anti-intellectual / psuedointellectual attitudes"....because it comes across as **wildly hypocritical**.
Engaging in fallacies while attacking others for being anti-intellectual is absurd.

I fail to see the importance of your response. I am still running my BIP148 node and will continue to do so until after Aug 1st. This is the best way for us to ensure that there is compromise on both sides and that the pending BIP141 SW proposal gets activated.
I have ever been the realist when it comes to BIP148, cautioning everyone here that without the economic majorities support, BIP148 has little chance of success. If you want to troll my history to see that for yourself, go for it. So my message has been consistent this entire time. Recognizing that its not getting the economic support it needs is not contradicting my stance, merely reckoning with the facts.

I agreed with it at first but after digesting the bigger picture and game theory I think it's toxic.
You cannot embrace a bip that requires economic support of industry to succeed and then be upset when that same industry supports a different plan. That stinks of hypocrisy to me.
A better system is meritocratic, which we currently have. Let core use bip8 to decide changes based on consensus built through open peer review.
Trying to force changes is radical and regardless of whether they are deserved or not this behavior will bite Bitcoin in the ass if it sets precedent.
What happens when this same solution (orphan non conformers) is used by bitmain, his pools, and supporting industry players to orphan non conformers over a actual technical controversial change?
If you support bip148s mechanism then you cannot complain when it is used against you. Yes, to me and you we can try to rationalize that this is done for a noble cause but when the same mechanism is being used against us the same rationalization will be used from the other side. In the end this is a system that's based on a lot of social communication to reach consensus and we need to respect the humanity on both sides to understand the reality of what we face and in what the future may hold.

Via BTC is on the record saying it on Twitter and a bitfury employee admitted that in a closed room session with Jihan that he made that statement as well.

Bitcoin operates outside of regulated environments. The fact that bitcoin is sovereign money is what makes it so uniquely special.
The point of the post was to highlight how using bitcoin instead of traditional banking bypasses their collection of your personal information and therefore the selling of that information to 3rd parties.
There will always be exchanges that have to comply with KYC/AML laws, and then there will always be open source wallets which DGAF, which anyone can use, anytime, anywhere, without big brother watching your every move.

Yes, but no more dangerous than what it already is. No more dangerous than already forcing miners to do X, Y, Z. If china bans alternative payment methods, whats to stop china from saying "you cannot send transfers via bitcoins" and then strong arming chinese miners?
The threat is real, but I dont see how this change effects it in any way. Or that it makes it more realistic or probable.
But aside from all that, its a encrypted container within the transaction. Who will know whether its used or not? How could you force someone to do something when you cannot measure whether its actually used?

This is cognitive dissonance in action folks. Clear as day for anyone to see. For years this clown has bashed core for their supposed mismanagement of bitcoin that caused  "too expensive" transactions.
So bitcoin core introduces a fix that reduces the cost of transactions and he bashes it because its "Core's centrally planned artificial price subsidy" that is "unfairly cheap".
I already knew this assclown was a retarded hypocrite, but this should make even his blind followers do a double take.
@_date: 2017-07-15 20:08:30
OK. So yes, that is your position. That **only** the market can decide.
Great. Now we have a starting point.
So, first, again, now for the **3rd time**, you have misconstrued my intentions and erected strawmen in an attempt to "lecture" me on economics. Its quite douchy btw.
Never have I said that we need to "fix the market". You must recognize there is a difference between bitcoin the software and its technical underpinnings and the bitcoin ecosystem which contains market participants.


Yet satoshi, and those after him, decided changes to the system and implemented them. Those were design choice decisions that created policies in which the market could decide upon. The market chose to accept those policies as here we are today, running that client.
Just like here we are today, running bitcoin core, and accepting the policies that were crafted from its authors.
The mistake here is that you are making some really basic errors by trying to mix the two subjects as one, when they clearly are not one subject. We must first recognize that bitcoin the **software** **is not a market and making changes to it is not "messing with the market"**. Examples of "messing with the market" would be creating centralized factions within the industry and trying to forcibly implement changes upon the userbase, aka segwit2x. Thats called industry collusion and its a perfect example of what you are complaining about.
When it comes to crafting policy, in a open source community, it is its participants which decide the outcome. The participants decide this outcome based on their social experiences. Network effects within a social society are fundamental aspects of a market. You can ignore that these exist if you like, but they exist regardless of your flawed maximalist behavior.
So when users engage in a behavior that gums up the network, that is a technical challenge. Especially so considering that there is code for the system on how to handle signature data, utxo and other transactional aspects. Making changes to these parameters definitely do have economic consequences, but is in no way shape or form "messing with the market". Users get to decide whether or not they run these changes, and since this is a open system in which all users get to make this decision then you cannot argue that anyone is attempting to forcibly make changes to the system for everyone.
Yet that is exactly what the SegWit2x signatories have decided to do. They have decided to collude by making secret closed room agreements to implement a change to the system that will be forced upon the industry by a majority hashrate. They've done this in a controversial setting and against the majority of experts who have rejected this path.
Now, I still have a decision in this process. I can reject their fork and continue to run on the Core blockchain. So you could then argue to me that I am not being forced to anything and given a choice.
But you would be ignoring the economic effects, the chainsplit and everything else that comes along with it. Again, we cannot live in a vacuum and pretend that these things dont have consequences.
Im not saying we should "change the market", im saying we should  analyze the data to ensure that there is equal and open fair access to all, **as the system was originally designed to do**.


Bullshit I am. I am calling for a meritocratic process in which the software design is done in an open transparent manner.
You are confusing the software with the market, acting like they are the same exact thing, and then having a free market maximalist attitude about it, which is not founded in reality.
There is no free market. You can stop with your fairy tales. If you dont think so, then why do we currently have a monopoly on ASIC manufacturing? How is it a free market when monopolies exist? How is it a free market when **one single individual** can blockade years of progress because he wants to "fire the core devs" ?
While your dreaming about free markets, can you dream me up a few thousand pounds of gold too? 
Free markets dont exist. 
Now, dont give me your shitty 2 sentence replies. I've responded several times now in depth, and several times you've responded with flippant half-assed responses. I cannot take you seriously if you cannot extend to me the same intellectual courtesy that I've extended to you.

GBTC will not have a overly drastic effect on marketprice because they are not obligated to purchase bitcoin like the COIN ETF would.
Its a strong signal to investors (and any participants) that bitcoin is maturing from a legal perspective, which causes increased positive outlook, but it should not have the dramatic effect you think it will.
COIN on the other hand.....*moon*.
And yes, we will *most definitely* see sub 300 again. Like, today, tomorrow, the next day, maybe all of next week, next month, who knows. As you may have noticed, good news has been coming out every day for almost a year now with little effect on the price. It will continue that way until we get more fundamental signals.

I am unsure the cost of production.

Its difficult for me to get upset about a writer making a poor comparison. There's 2 layers here, the forefront layer is the writer, and the 2nd meta layer is the genocide.
Since we are discussing the first layer and not the second, you cannot mock outrage about the second layer and use that as fuel for your fake outrage.

Also, the article states range is 3m (9ft) so the only practical application right now is within 1 room. Also, it is a light spectrum, so that means that it will *not* go through walls.

It's not a implausible theory. [Academic research]( to date shows a approx 30% of Bitcoin activity being linked to the dark market ecosystem.

My node hardware has not changed in 2 years and I imagine most of others have not either. 
You are suggesting that people should constantly upgrade to support the network. This suggestion is not a financially viable option for most of the people in the world. Most of the people in the world live in poverty and not 1st world countries.
So which do you want...a bitcoin that supports both the poor and the rich, or a bitcoin that supports just the rich?
Because in order for bitcoin to remain decentralized and therefore censorship resistant, citizens from their respective countries must be able to financially participate in running a node.
Something that cannot happen if we must upgrade our nodes every 2 years because we have reckeless engineers who dont take into consideration the fundamental value propositions of bitcoin.

It would be entirely unreasonable to expect every consumer to run a full node to use the Lightning Network. This is no different than any bitcoin wallet developer creating a piece of wallet software that does not require a full node to operate, such as Electrum.
Such options *must* exist in order for mainstream adoption.
I understand your concern here, but it is misplaced. So long as there is a economic incentive to run a LN node, then people will run them. You must accept this logic as this is how bitcoin works. Have some faith, if the money is on the table people will take it.
Instead, you should be thanking developers for progressing towards the introduction of light consumer grade software  so that we can become one step closer to a lightning network taking a load off bitcoin.

That was one hell of a chicken and egg roundabout problem.
He was against it because of the risk it posed, but BIP148 could only be successful if there was enough support that it would pressure others. 
So now that its helped (to some extent) pressure others into activating segwit through BIP91, **now** the risk is reversed. Non enforcing (but signaling) miners are now the risk and BIP148 is the holding of the feet to the fire to ensure that things follow through.
So basically it was too risky to do, and now its too risky to not do.

You missed his entire point. He provided a reason to you why you as a law abiding citizen should rally behind the cause as it creates transparency and equality in a financial system.
Also, protecting illegal activity is protecting legal activity. This is like free speech, if you want the system to work for everyone....*then it needs to work for everyone*.
That's a aspect of society most people ignore. You cannot have something be fair unless it applies to all.
But the system that is trying to he created by industry is a system that can be selectively changed. And that ruins Bitcoin as it changes it from a fair system to a system of central control.

Correct. If bip91 triggers early activation they will orphan blocks before bip148.
It won't matter much though because by that point pretty much everyone will be signaling segwit blocks. It would be such a fraction of a minority chain split that it probably wouldn't cause any disruption at all other than for the few stragglers left behind who have not upgraded

I've tried all sorts of tactics and none of them works. The supposed best way is to tell them that you are recording the conversation and that you've formally given them notice to not call you, and that any further violation will be reported to the authorities. Which usually does nothing.
What I do instead, is i act super excited like I want to buy everything they are selling, then ask them to hold.  I then put them on hold for 2-3 minutes, pick it back up, and then act super excited, and then act like theres a important interruption...and so sorry sir, but can you please hold again? I need to find my credit card.
Just keep doing this to see how long you can keep them on the line. Nothing will frustrate these people more than losing time. Their management will monitor their average call time and they will be judged based on this call to sales ratio. Fuck that ratio up and they will get fired.

I've always wondered about the details of this. I remember DarkWallet first proposing implementing this stealth concept.
How will the wallet know when to start looking for these transactions, and will this always be a feasible method? If bitcoin really takes off, that could be hundreds of thousands or millions of transactions to try your key against, seems like it would take some pretty serious CPU power to attempt to decrypt all these tx's.
Or is part of all of this exchange a time/date range so the wallet knows specifically where and when to find the transaction?
EDIT - Should have read more. It talks about reusable codes replacing this concept. Eager beaver me.


Could someone expand on how that is precisely possible? I've re-read the section 5 times and still dont get it. I understand that the receiver doesn't publish them because he and the sender have shared encrypted keys that allow them to generate addresses/keys not visible to the rest of the world, but how does the transaction get published without taint or exposing amounts?

I would say 4GB would be a better starting point for ram with a 4mb effective blocksize, though 8 would be optimal. 1.5 ghz + processor.

Frustrating to see Vinny have it so entirely backwards.
The threat is executives colluding with miners to force a non-technical solution that is entirely sub-optimal when we have the most optimal solution pending upgrade, which would already be activated if it was not for the miners stalling progress, the very same miners that Vinny is trying to "compromise" with.
Its just so goddamn stupid. Stop treating malicious actors in the space with a spoon filled with honey. You guys are fucking pathetic. This pandering to specialized interest groups **BY SPECIALIZED INTEREST GROUPS** is exactly what bitcoin is intended by get rid of!

BTC-E is a Exchange run on server hardware. The DAO is a smart contract that exists in the ethereum blockchain. Comparing the two is quite naive as they have absolutely nothing in common and exist on completely different layers of reality. One is a tangible physical thing and another is code in the cloud.
Standard 0-day exploits would be effective against centralized servers like btc-e. DAO has nothing to do with any of this.

Ok. And how exactly is this destroying fungibility? There is a difference between theory and application. Since you claim that this is a means to a ends, please provide the ends. Show me where the ability to trace the blockchain has resulted in fungibility issues.
I can think of a single incident. One. I dont believe there has ever been another, and that one incident was only a example of one single exchange thinking they could play dictator. It did not change  the overall fungibility, it just reduced fungibility on that exchange.
The example was the one time that btc-e froze stolen funds from some hack of some marketplace. I dont really remember the details, just that they decided to relieve the thief of his funds.
But that thief could have sent the funds elsewhere, infact *anywhere* else and not had a issue, so the overall fungibility was uneffected.
I've found that usually when people start their sentences with "for starters...." it implies that they really dont have any other points. You can prove me wrong of course, it would be nice.
And before anyone thinks to turn this into a discussion of privacy enhancing technologies needed, let me forestall you, yes, they are needed. No, its not a issue now, but it will be in the future. The only way we can combat that is with privacy enhancing technologies which are already being developed. CT from Maxwell, BIP151, and that other BIP that breadwallet was trying to implement that was similar to CT.

I think the most deserving thanks here is to the large group of developers in the Bitcoin Core project that stayed mostly neutral on the BIP148 debate and brought us the thing we are all celebrating - SegWit. Yes, we had luke come out for it, and greg against it, but mostly everyone stayed neutral and thats some impressive professionalism.
Its easy to celebrate short term success without analyzing long term effects. BIP148 was a risky maneuver and its important that we dont set this kind of precedent for controversial changes.
SegWit being non-controversial was the only reason BIP148 succeeded in speeding up the timeline for SegWit2x and getting energy spent on tweaking BIP91 to accomplish this goal.

...using all of the previous dev teams codebase? Smooth logic there.


False equivalence / fallacy of inconsistency and a complete disregard of the facts.
There's 2 ways to foster adoption in the current scaling debate. A "simple" blocksize upgrade, or SW which upgrades the blocksize and allows 2nd layer decentralized scaling tech.
The first does very little for scaling and kicks the can down the road by burdening the expensive of the network *upon altruistic node operators who happen to be the lifeblood of bitcoins decentralization*. [This will reduce node count]( On top of that it introduces attack vectors that makes the system less resilient. 
The second option fixes the node incentivization issue while encouraging the fostering growth *of nodes*, which is essential for bitoins health.
So what solution fosters more adoption...the one that kicks people off the network by elevating network resource costs, or the one that re-aligns the cost matrix not only for transactions but for node operators, *and* allows for decentralized 2nd layer scaling solutions, *and* fixes malleability.....

Volatility is due to a lack of liquidity (thin order books). The reason this is, is because we have a 3b market cap. Thats pennies compared to trillion dollar market caps like gold.

I understand. I merely wanted to point out that she (by her own words) clearly stipulates gold as money, yet bitcoin can be converted into fiat much more easily than gold can. Seems that those two viewpoints are at conflict with each other. 
How many other assets exist right now, that you can instantly convert into fiat?
If you think about stocks, bonds, and other paper market assets, there is a lengthy process in which you must adhere to before you can liquidate those assets into fiat. You must execute contracts with your broker prior to liquidation and *then* you request the transfer of wealth to your bank account.
I think this is a important element when determining the definition of money. How easily is the asset turned into tangible money (cash) ? Bitcoin is the *only* global asset that can cross borders and be liquidated into cash in a small period of time. 
The bitcoin-railed remittance market is AWESOME! OTC exchanges are pretty efficient.
What other asset classes can you think of that you can efficiently, quickly, and near market value exchange high volume assets?
Bitcoin is superior money.

Im not following your logic, and I think you are not following mine. Do you think that every person around the world has access to rackmount servers with 100's of TB's and gbit connections in their homes?
If not, how exactly do you think a system that has those requirements could remain decentralized? If you do not think that a on-chain scaling solution that can compete with VISA requires those specs, then you've done *zero* homework. It would take approx 8GB blocks (remember, every 10 minutes?) to compete with VISA TPS with on-chain. When you do basic math on bandwidth and storage, you'll see what I meant about those specs not being possible on a decentralized network.
There's no fallacy here, just someone who is ignoring basic facts, or perhaps does not understand them.

Good, no one gives a fuck about elites getting rich. Bitcoin is not meant to be a get rich quick scheme and if thats your intention all great for you dude, I wish you the best of luck and hope you get what you want.
Bitcoin is about enabling sovereign money that is resistant to corruption. 
Corruption like your boy having too much skin in the game and advocating for something that was completely immoral. He showed his true colors with that action and as far as im concerned that invalidates ETH from ever being able to act as a sovereign money.
If its not Sovereign money then why bother? You can do fancy accounting tricks with databases. You dont need a super expensive extremely inefficient wasteful non-decentralized crypto coin to do that shit.
Im sure as you are sitting in your mansion sipping your martini's you wont be thinking about the venezuelans who are standing up to tanks so that they can have a stable currency to *buy fucking food to eat*, but as always that is the problem....the ultra rich ignoring the problems in the world.

If we are going to HF, then yes we can limit transactions, yes that would fix the issue.
My reasoning to not have 4MB has always been the same. There's no need for 4MB and it negatively impacts nodes. I've wrote 3 billion comments on the subject so here's the quickest random one I could find - 
4MB will only create spam opportunities of a valuable resource and shoulder the cost on non-incentivized node operators. LN fixes this issue by incentivizing node operators, so we should keep it to 2MB, get LN going, see how that impacts usage and then evaluate.

No, he clearly is, and its all besides the point anyways because that was a strawman.


Your permissions output failed to discuss handing over CC info, including CC digits. 
As for giving your personal information, duh, of course it does how else do you create a *sybil resistant* poll? The only way to do so *is by identifying yourself* so that's assumed by default. If I were to take a guess on payment method limits, there are minimums regarding account verification. If you are above that threshold, you are verified, and therefore **sybil resistent**. Luke must get that information in order to prove that there are not sock puppets creating coinbase accounts to skew the poll results. How else do you expect someone to manage a sybil resistant poll? Seems like he's done a rather good job at getting what he needs with minimum intrusion on your personal info. Bear in mind its only whats on your **public** profile, which you can edit before taking the poll to remove any sensitive information. However one must wonder why you have sensitive info in your public profile in the first place? 
It appears you are bikeshedding. You do realize that all you are doing is furthering the strawman? You are trying to prop up information which has no relevant bearing upon the results.
How does luke confirming your public info change the results? You know that it doesn't and you know that trying to distract from the results is only perpetuating this strawman.

I think its a rather relevant issue. You may be correct, but I think having alternative competing solutions is obviously a healthy thing for any environment. The core concept of bitcoin is being open source and creating competition, so in that spirit we should embrace any and all attempts at innovation.
It could have been a less toxic debate, yes, and many other improvements, but I would argue that we do need alternative implementations that challenge the status quo.

Actually, it does. Any asset that is used in the act of money laundering, whether it is real estate, luxury cruise ships or tulips, does not relieve the liability of the criminal action.
I've seen plenty of other money laundering cases in much higher courts than this rule based on that principal. Its important to remember where the courts sit on the hierarchy to determine the validity of their rulings.
I understand that maybe in specific states, there are "unique" laws that apply, but in *most* of the USA you can get busted for money laundering no matter what assets you use to cover your criminal acts.

Im confused why coinbase is receiving so much funding. And what these banks think they are going to get out of these investments.


That's a mindblowing valuation. What is the basis? What assets is coinbase holding? What could possibly go into the valuation that would make the bitcoin payment processor worth near half a billion dollars?
I can't help but think that bitcoin will either become so implemented into society that these btc to fiat bridges are unnecessary, or it will fail, both situations that would make coinbase worth very little or nothing. Bitcoin development will continue to progress and enhance its privacy, security and fungibility through features added by our excellent developers. Features that will make the coinbases of the future irrelevant. 
The only way that coinbase could stay relevant (to the tune of half a billion in valuation) in a bitcoin immersed society is by doing what modern Conglomerates do to all industries - Choke the industry with lobbying and restrictions, creating monopolies and restricting competition.  But there are some really large assumptions for that plan to be successful. One of them is the complete regulation of bitcoin within society, so that OTC trades are not possible, and all bitcoin finances are done through "approved" intermediaries like coinbase. The entire point of bitcoin is to prevent this from occurring, to free ourselves from financial enslavement. Bitcoin is the trojan horse of money and any industry CEO that thinks they can corner the market are going to be proven just how fucking awesome bitcoin is in the long run.....assuming we can retain a decentralized network and keep the core properties of bitcoin intact.

Every single Bitcoin boom and bust moves more and more BTC from weak hands to Strong.
This means that stronger hands will be less likely to cave into pressure, reducing supply side pressure. People commonly fail to realize that the reason Bitcoin can shoot so high so quickly is because of its limited supply, but more specifically because holders know how to hodl.
This culture of hodl is an incredible fuel for the price of Bitcoin. it does make me wonder if there really is any value that could cause the majority of strong hands to sell.
Or will they just hold forever on the basis that Bitcoin will become so commonplace that there is no reason to trade it for dollars? With recent news of Amazon whole foods and maybe eBay.....I think we are a lot closer to that than most people realize.

Definitely do not listen to this advice. I have seen some exchanges claimed to have insurance.

Yet some of these peoples ideological stances have allowed them to make morally compromising decisions that are against the networks health.
How can you possibly justify stalling bitcoins progress with a minority veto when the reasons are self-admitted items such as "SW txs are too cheap", "core needs to be fired" and the asicboost elephant? I might also add that saying you obstructing progress in an attempt to "fire" the developers of a project is **literally** the definition of a coup/hostile takeover. You cannot mince those words, he said them clear as day. You are supporting *these* people???
If you can rationalize these clear cut unethical actions as moral then you are quite clearly compromised yourself.
How can you justify spending half a million per week or month or whatever to attack the chain with maliciously obstructed txs whose only purpose is to artificially drive up the price of transactions so that others may suffer and a political agenda is achieved? For those of you who cry "Where is the proof" there is proof a plenty, its just whether you understand it or have even bothered to look at it. Here's a good analysis that shows 18 months of ongoing spam -
Now I will be the first one to say that the blockchain needs to be and morality and ethical neutral and that we shouldn't need to rely on people's personal moralistic attitudes in order for Bitcoin to succeed. But we have a major problem when Bitcoin is centrally controlled by a single individual or two who owns enough Manufacturing resources or wealth Capital so that they can control The Narrative of Bitcoin development or skew fee data to the point that everyone suffers and their ideological or political campaign achieves its goal. Bitmain funds, as a single entity, pretty much all of the other major development teams. That's incredibly concerning and if you don't think so you are compromised.
The problem here is that these monopolistic forces and Central actors are making economically irrational decisions that are working against the best interest of the network.
And it's the same actors who are attempting to centralize the system further. This problem wouldn't be a problem if it was not for centralization effects. These people wouldn't be important and their ideas wouldn't be important if they didn't control such a large majority of resources. Yet here they are trying to further centralize the system and ways that benefit them and do not benefit everyone else. Bitmain is economically benefited by controlling development that allows them to use their patented anti-competitive behavior (Bitcoin ABC/BU) and garzik is economically benefitted through his coin analytics company, which we already see he is trying to profit off of when his company ended up as a dns seed node in the current code (im sure that was merely a coincedence). These are in-your-face-shit-you-cannot-deny facts but we have outspoken folks defending these actions. These are not bitcoiners, these are the enemies of bitcoin.
Bitcoin needs to be resistant to these kinds of effects and the only way it can remain resistant is through decentralization. Decentralization is a priority that the core model has focused on and that your faction has worked against.
I've always respected you Eric but in the last year or two you've really taken sides with the enemies of Bitcoin and that to me is very frustrating. 
The proof is in the pudding as they say and the pudding is the mempool/transaction data that fell off a cliff like a rock as soon as the segwit 2x agreement was reached. We could have had reasonable transaction fees this entire time if the people who you are cheering for wouldn't have been consistently attacking the network. Their narrative would have been dead in the water because we wouldn't have been suffering the ills we have been. SegWit alone is clearly enough to handle the network for the next few years as we transition to side chains Drive chains second layer networks and the like.
But you have been advocating for the changes that are reckless risky dangerous and serves no purpose but a further political agenda. I don't see you as neutral I see you as just being in the closet about being on the side that has been caught red-handed attempting to sabotage Bitcoin.
I would say that you should feel ashamed for yourself but I think that you are too compromised to realize that you are compromised. Your ideology has driven you to ignore facts.
We all want whats best for bitcoin, but some of us are ignoring facts when drawing conclusions and then getting riled up about political and ideological preference while ignoring the ramifications of engineering changes. Some of us are negligent in our ignorance, and some of us are being purposefully negligent. I know the people who are being purposefully negligent and the people who are just caught up in the whirlwind of ideological preference.
I think you are the latter, but you should wake up drink some coffee and check your facts so that you can not just do whats best for your ideological preference, but instead whats best for the network as a whole. We know your sites need cheap fee's to operate. Everyone here **wants** your site to have cheap fee's. Why do you think we've been fighting so hard for SW? It gives everyone what they want. There just seems to be a group of angry children who want to stamp their feet and make unrealistic demands on top of the changes because their pudding didn't come with fancy peanut butter swirls like they demanded.

Any examples of any central bank you can find in the modern world that has not devalued its currency will be exceptions to the rule, not the rule. The modern society of fiat based currencies will result in the same catastrophe as zimbabwe, just in different symptoms. We've already seen the beginning. 
Do you really not know whats going on around the world? Do you have no idea whats going on with the ECB, Japan, NIRP? The writing is on the wall and if you want to pretend its not please keep your delusions to yourself. We have trillions in debt around the world and everyone is playing musical chairs. Eventually the music stops, and the entire world will deleverage. The results of that will be catastrophic, and just as many bad things as happened in zimbabwe will be repeated around the world. It wont happen overnight, but it will happen.

And who do you think is the Microsoft and Comcast of bitcoin?
Those are real monopolies. Those monopolies dont exist yet in bitcoin. There is no government in bitcoin to grant monopolistic license and regulatory burdens upon the competition like there is with Comcast.
Bitcoin Core is the only Microsoft I could think of in this analogy, and even thats wrong because they are open source. Thats the only thing in the industry that could compare in terms of global adoption/installation base. Which is all the more reason why when industry tries to fork away from Bitcoin Core that they will have a very shitty lesson.
We still have hope of being free from industry control.

While the thread is informative, I don't think you should use that as a basis for reality. If you read the entire thread you'll notice that a lot of developers disagree with the roadmap and Greg specifically says that the timeline for Signature aggregation (schnorr) is unrealistic.
Even if they do manage two finish the grunt work of The Code by the end of this year there is no guarantee of any timeline that it will be activated. Look at segwit 2 years later and here were finally looking like we might actually have it.
Who is to say that the same thing won't happen with signature aggregation and compression techniques and that would mean that we might not have it until 2020 if the situation was the same as with segwit.

Which is exactly why I never got a hard on for Libertarianism. Its so frustrating when someone like Gary Johnson is so right on almost ALL the issues, and then so illogically dead wrong on some of the biggest.
Global warming is the largest disaster facing humanity. This is not idle speculation. The most intelligent and researched beings on this planet have long reached consensus on this issue. Anyone who says otherwise simply has not done the research.
Yet here gary johnson advocates that the free market will take care of everything. Yet, he *knows* thats not true. 
Wealth and power concentrates without government interference. This is what Thomas Piketty has proven in [his book on capitalism]( which is not just theory or speculation, but based on [using empirical evidence from 30 countries]( going back to the 17th century.


This is not a capitalism problem, this is a *human* problem. Capitalism is just one form of governing that has taken shape in modern history. Its better than theocracy or monarchies in regards to inequality, but still suffers the same issue. Wealth and power concentrates. Without regulation, that concentration becomes a monopoly that always acts within its best interest.
This is the problem with humanity, and libertarianism does not fix it. It enables it to go full blown retard. The *only* way that you can fix wealth and power from being over-concentrated is through a constitution and government regulation. Maybe in the future we will have AI to govern us. Its our only chance at saving ourselves, by removing humanity from governing.
Now, we all know all the fuckups of the past and the current. There is obviously good regulation and bad regulation. The issue is that we cannot decide on which ones to expand and which ones to cut back.
But anyone who thinks anarchy or full blown deregulation can fix anything have not thought this through. The existence of humanity literally depends on it. 
And a footnote on ALL of this - There is no fucking free market. Anyone who thinks there is a free market is delusional. The free market exists in theory, but not in practice. The genie is out of the bottle. Wealth and power in concentrated forms exist. There never is and never was, in modern society, a free market. There are always players with more power that will dominate the game, people with power to rig the system. Thats not a "free" market. The board was never equal and never will be.  The health of Society requires that monopolies be abolished. So we have to ask ourselves....do we want inequality and massive suffering, or do we want a balanced society? Some of you want the way of the old, where if you paid the iron price you could be king. Well you heathens can go live in filthy fucking forests and fight to the death then.
Bitcoiners should especially know this. Why do you guys think there is so much "game theory" applied to bitcoin? Because *all systems get gamed*.

Im pretty positive that the OB developers would tailor OB to not display illicit goods upon opening. Im also positive that they will allow for custom home pages which is tailored to the individuals search preferences or specified categories. We will see, but im pretty sure they wont take a radical hard line free market principle "we must let users see whatever comes first" stance. Im sure they will use modern techniques to tailor to the individuals unique experience, as all things do today.
Your assertion of it being that way is simply because you've not thought far enough into development, or perhaps you simply cannot envision the path forward.


Yes. That's what would cause the bootstrapping actually. Its probably a good thing. Im sure when those drug marketplaces on the underside started getting busted and it went all over the media  , that it was *that* that really amplified the usage of those marketplaces.
There's no such thing as bad press, and in the case of bootstraping markets, thats a really good way to get the job done. They could never market themselves nearly as effectively as media outlets would reporting on illicit goods.


Horrible example, because *everyone* uses torrents. We are talking about the success of the marketplace, right? So that point is counter intuitive to yours. It only invalidates your own thoughts.


Oh no! What will happen! They *think* that I *might* be purchasing illicit goods, when in reality im just getting a video card for 10% cheaper? The world will stop spinning! Fire will flow out from the earth and burn everything! The sky will fall!

I searched and saw this was never posted here. Its huge news and I think it has far reaching implications beyond ethereum and into other crypto spectrums.
I think this is probably a good thing for institutionalized actors who wish to use ETH as a foundation for their blockchain tech. They will see this action as a safeguard to their interests, knowing that they can recuperate lost investments if something similar happens.
I think law enforcement and government agencies are loving this, as it proves they can subvert the system.
I think bitcoiners hate this, as it dismantles the notion that ethereum is a decentralized technology. Clearly any powerful central actor that can convince the rest of the system to move a specific way against all tradition can now use that authority in malignant ways.

@_date: 2016-07-26 19:13:05


Its very interesting to think about, and will be fascinating to watch it develop.
For example, you are probably correct in that illicit trade will bootstrap the market, but im wondering will that same illicit trade steer legal merchants away from doing business on the OB platform?
I think the answer is yes, but at what percentage? Out of 10 merchants, how many will look at OB, see some guy selling weed there, and go "No, I dont want my business to be on this market" ?
When you rationalize it, its all rather silly. Who cares what other vendors are selling? Would you not list a product on ebay because you found some guy selling Rhino Horns? I doubt anyone would care enough to suffer for the principal. 
I personally believe that the illicit market will not steer away enough legal merchants that it will fail to bootstrap the legal merchandise.
And with bitcoin easy enough to buy now, I think its just a matter of time before OB starts absorbing significant market share. Think of how many ebay vendors will jump over to OB once they start getting spammed on Ebay? Hopefully the OB guys are smart enough to initiate a marketing (spam) campaign directed towards ebay sellers. 
EBay takes a ridiculous piece of the pie from sellers. I have no doubt that once people realize they can list their items on OB and make near 10% more (ebay/paypal/bank transfers etc). Or, they can sell their products for 10% less and make a killing.

False Narrative. You should never change your stance on something because of anecdotal. 
Obviously this controversial HF was against the fundamental nature of blockchains, that being censorship resistance. Such a fundamental change is of course going to see resistance. It literally redefined the fundamental nature of the technology, that it is a blockchain and immutable, into a database that is mutable.
Using this as a justification to change your stance on HF vs SF is not a rational position to take.
A HF with appropriate activation thresholds and appropriately timed communication from developers who have reached consensus on the data is low-risk.
I am now of the position that ETH is a database, and ETC is a blockchain. ETC is now worth substantially more than ETH, in my opinion.

I would agree with you in general, but for this specific comment he clearly demonstrated *he doesn't know what he's talking about* with his own comment. It was self incriminating. Anyone who thinks otherwise clearly does not understand technology. on-chain blockchain scaling solutions can exist, today, as a corporate colo environment with very beefy servers and high network throughput. If you think that same infrastructure can exist as *a decentralized system* then you (and him and anyone else) clearly don't understand the technology at hand here.


Care to cite some examples?
I dont see Garzik or Andresen being "shunned". They are welcome to cooperate and work with other developers as they always have been. I've seen the encouragement first hand. Those are the two primary examples of your scenario, and I dont think there are any better examples you can think of? Willing to let you try of course :)

Oh I agree. I will never say "we should stop pursuing the usage of markets". Markets are the best management tool we have, its just important to understand there is no free market, so there is no free market principle, so that we can all be free of bias and come to more rational conclusions about what is possible vs what is not. I like the thought of prediction markets, but I fear they suffer the human fallacies. Hopefully we can build such prediction markets with great AI's to overcome these issues. This is why I love bitcoin, because it fixes one of the bigger issues (state controlled currency, monetary policy) and makes prediction markets one step closer to reality.


Absolutely, I accede this point. It is only through state license that these institutions have been granted their ability to create wealth.


No, it actually does not, at least to me. I was picking up what you put down and nothing seemed out of line.


The reason I asked you for examples was because you made a lot of sense. And I've yet to hear a example of how libertarianism can pursue deregulation and allow for a balanced economy that both preforms healthy function and protects the health and environment of the individual.
I think you think we are different, but we are not. I am willing to change any position dependent upon data being made available. 


No nails here. This is a highly complex topic so I dont really expect clear answers. Theory is only theory until applied and measured. But since you are a libertarian who dismisses some of Gary Johnson's ideas, and you seem to discredit the idea's from him that I find preposterous, I thought maybe you could do a better job at representing the tougher questions.


Im not sure how, but I have to disagree on principle, the same way that pursuing a true free market is a worthy pursuit, so is planning a prosperous society. 


This rung very true with me, and the drug war is the best example. It costs a 100x more to enforce drug enforcement, as opposed to educating. I think the statistic was for every x amount spent on enforcement, 10 kilos of cocaine are reduced. For the same amount spent on education, 1000 kilos's are reduced from circulation.
Much cheaper, more efficient, and ubuntu (humanistic) to pay for education instead of state enforcement. This applies to health issues as well, pregnancy, population control, STD's, AIDS, you name it.

They weighed the additional technical costs of the code against the positive reduction of resources and deemed it a positive trade-off. 
Thats how engineers engineer.
This entire "debate" was never a debate. It was posturing of ego's and pride over technical information. And there are enough stupid people who refuse to admit they are not knowledgeable enough to understand the technicals that want to shout louder than the real experts on the subject.
And the real experts, as firm as they have communicated, get ignored by these idiots.

You've yet to respond to any of my post that counters this theory that BIP148 coins will be more valuable. Why dont you spend the time addressing my points so that we can come to a conclusion rather than just stating generalities over and over?


Past performance does not guarantee future results. Also, these soft forks you are referring to were initiated and deployed by Bitcoin Core. Are you really comparing a grass roots movement to an established incumbent? Apples to oranges and setting your expectations based on that is not being realistic.


No, deepbit got 50% of the hashrate and users abandoned them. But, I fail to see how this is relevant to our discussion. The context of this discussion in comparison to their situation is completely apples vs oranges.


You are assuming that there will be a abandoned chain here without even demonstrating any competent argument as to why there will be an abandoned chain. As I've stated before, you've failed to address my most major concerns because you are **specifically avoiding replying to them**.
Why dont you stop responding to me, and start responding to [my response to you which posits important questions]( that you've failed to address?


I agree with you here however that is not the scope of this discussion. I understand the majority of the ecosystem has deployed segwit. This discussion is not about that, this discussion is about the ramifications of this activation method and the results that will follow during the interim period in which there are no SW transactions but SW orphaned blocks.
luke, please just respond to my original post. In our entire conversation thread here I have gone literally point by point on your responses and you are cherry picking 10% of my post and responding to it.
Please stop cherry picking. Go back to the post I've asked you 3 separate times now and please address the concerns I've stated.

Now if only you guys could fix the "req quota" connection issue that has plagued your site for literally 3 years now.
I've long held the belief that you guys are purposefully not fixing it. There's simply no way that no one else could have this issue and you guys cannot solve it for 3 years.
I think of all of the sites that have 100x the traffic that your wallet provider has, and how these sites all miraculously dont have this connection issue.
I have it directly from multiple sources that they have not been able to access their wallet through your onion for *months* now. Literally months. Like, no matter what time of the day, its always that quota exceeded error. For **months** straight now.

Okay. So, lets say the ePlug has set of drivers etc to deal with the meshnet, and a bootloader for the OS on a 'live' (no write, only read) partition.
Then it grabs the OS from the cloud (BC in this case) and then runs it? Is that correct?
@_date: 2015-02-03 16:42:27
Im thinking the same thing Natanael_L is.
I the OS has a 'secure update' mechanism, that is only a update mechanism. What is to stop the host computer (eplug) from being exploited (HW or SW) and having the bootloader or other fundamental aspects changed so that it ignores the update mechanism and rogue software/bootloader/kernel patched?
Even intel and AMD are having issues securing their hardware. How is this going to provide a more secure hardware/software platform that cannot be exploited?

Supporting ETHC is supporting a immutable ledger. That is a fundamental value to blockchains and they've gone and broken it.

This is a very short sighted opinion. Were you not around for the last two years as SW was demonized as blockstream take over propaganda? During that period SW was constantly referred to as vaporware, and then a Trojan horse and then whatever crazy thoughts goes on in these weak minds.
Throughout this period there was constant political pressure with Bitcoin Classic, and then BU to increase the blocksize.
Those movements failed and it became obvious that there was not going to be a alternative implementation reference client to take over from core.
At this point and only this point did the movement for segwit start to progress in a positive fashion in that various factions started supporting it that previously did not.
So no I disagree with your commentary on the basis that it lacks vision and shape and does not recognize the historical context that came into play regarding this entire Fiasco.
@_date: 2017-06-05 18:24:07




I noticed the same thing and was confused.


I've been talking to people about trying to get this code into place now. We will essentially need service providers to offer either 0 bal utxo's from the bip148 for use as inputs or servicers offering mostly non-interactive 2-or-3 multisig transactions that allows you to mix.
If we do not have a means to easily split the coins, then there is no way to specifically transact on the chain. If there is no easy way to specifically transact on the bip148 chain, then there is no chance in hell that it can make a economical impact. If there is no chance of a economical impact, then there will be no price advantage on bip148 coins and therefore no reason for miners to switch to that coin.
@_date: 2016-07-05 18:55:57

I actually agree with this. If the organization can be exploited by a single scammer than it is incredibly weak.
While I am a big supporter of decentralized platforms I also recognize that there are some pretty extreme trade-offs that I don't know how you can resolve.
For example what very limited experience I have dealing with p2p Fiat trades (helping others) has resulted in fraud.
The trade off here is that a centralized organization can enforce specific parameters that will greatly reduce fraud.  A decentralized organization cannot do this.
So every time you trade crypto for cash on these systems you are risking losing it all and having your bank close your account on top due to fraudulent chargebacks.
These two systems are simply incompatible. Yes you can alleviate some of this pressure by restricting trade to highly rated individuals, but there is an assumption here that the feedback cannot be gamed. We know it can be gamed.
The only way to truly reduce fraud is to have pre-approved sellers that meet specific conditions (kyc). Yet this is a function of a centralized organization and cannot be replicated with a decentralized market.
I have yet to see a decentralized Market that works with Fiat and doesn't put extreme risks on the person selling crypto. I don't see a way to resolve it and I think these two systems are just incompatible.

Yes, but if 99% don't believe you, how is your idea going to catch on? The only way it can is if it has a efficiency, a evolutionary aspect to it that overrides the norm, or another way a idea could succeed is with network effects. But if 99% don't believe it, then those network effects cannot occur, and we go right back to my first point.
It has to be *better* than the other idea's to succeed without network effects.
Another way it can happen is when you have the power to make a change despite what others feelings are. But with great power comes great responsibility. This is why checks and balances exist.

In hindsight, both Gavin and Brian have been poor leaders that argued the merits of flawed designs. They do deserve criticism for that, and thats totally fair.

The average person is not running a node, so the average person does not need worry about it.

This is a misconception. Antpool can reallocate enormous resources to attack the bip148 chain and it would be in their economic benefit since they are protecting their asicboost.
You also cannot expect miners who have already expressed ideological differences, and even went so far as to act on it (look at what happened on LTC, Jihan &amp; Friends blocked activation of SW there!) to behave rationally.
You must instead expect irrational behavior and design for it. The previous model of rational actors we have always assumed does not exist in bitcoin anymore thanks to Bitmain. We must instead assume irrational and even malicious behavior.

I think that we will have to see what happens when Miners and Industry players try to force changes upon the network against the users. We are going to have that opportunity this November when segwit 2X attempts to hard Fork.
I personally think that they will have a short-term price advantage while core suffers a long difficulty adjustment. But I think that core will gain the price and eventually hashrate back while segwit 2X stays on as a niche blockchain just like ethereum classic.
The reason is simple all of the real Developers are with core. They are the ones that are going to create all of the quality content and the market will eventually realize this no matter how irrationally it behaves in the beginning.
That's the reason that etherium classic did not retain the value because all of the developers left.

Since you are really active on this front, could you try to explain why the recent merge of James Hillards BIP91 modification that was ACK'd by Jeff would not create a compatible solution with BIP148? I read nullc state that the proposal is not compatible with BIP148 but I thought the recent change resolved the issue.
If I am understanding correctly, the recent proposed change would reduce the amount of blocks on the BIP91 activation method which would then squeak Segwit2x into alignment with bip148 by August 1st?
And would changing the coinbase to signal NYA effect this signaling mechanism?

Malicious block construction is most definitely a issue. Why do you think 4mb limit was placed?
To prevent greater than 4mb malicious blocks from being constructed and used as a poison block attack.


I've always wanted a blocksize increase, just done in a safe manner. SW via bip141 accomplished that goal with extreme elegance and very high safety. Unfortunately we have reckless chinese billionaires who think their ego matters more than all the participants within the system.

I keep trying to pin him down on this point and he keeps wiggling out of it. I keep asking "Wait, doesn't this rely upon luck?" and he keeps saying no.  He said "the locktime makes it valid to legacy nodes, but not to BIP148 nodes, so long as it goes first and has an equal or higher fee than the later one, only BIP148 nodes will accept the later one"
Which I dont understand. Do you? Why would the locktime be valid to legacy but not bip148?
I prefer a full proof method. So doing a 2-of-3 multisig with a miner (or anyone) with bip148 coins to a trusted escrow who releases it back to you would really be the optimal solution I think.
I think we will have a need of such services because even if exchanges do support BIP148, what about people who dont use exchanges and wish to transact on the bip148 chain?

No. SegWit2x is a bundled hardfork. Everyone agrees to run the software and then network will either come to a consensus and 100% runs it (and it then later hardforks because everyone is running that pre-determined hardforked software) or the network splits and a minority chain is created, maybe lives, maybe dies, doesn't matter.
That hardfork is still happening because 100% of that fork is running that pre-bundled hardfork code.
So no, I reject that premise and its clear that SegWit2x was a win for those big blockers who have been on a political parade for the last 2 years. 
It makes perfect sense that those who have been bloating the blockchain stopped once the agreement was signed.


Then you must accept that your hypothesis is wrong. Sorry but you dont get to cherry pick portions and facts and then build a model and claim its correct.
If it was true then mempool would have continued to rise as the price did. It did not. That means that there was coordinated spam transactions being pushed on the blockchain with the purpose of skewing fee data.

You cannot have a censorship-resistant decentralized network that relies upon centralized datacenters.
This should be self-evident and does not take any formal logical proofs to explain.


This was a rational statement from satoshi (like most of his statements). Now ask yourself, why would someone who holds this vision advocate for a centrally controlled network, such as "specialists with server farms of specialized hardware", which only exist in central network operational centers ?
Don't these two facts conflict? How does one deal with the cognitive dissonance here?

You mean their lack of political process? 


Not really. Core is comprised of its code. What else is there? They are not dictators of bitcoin. They simply release open source code.
Seems a bit shortsighted on your end to not realize this. 


Yes, and again, if you make a one line change to a parameter, do you ignore the other [near 10,000 lines of code]( ?
How is it that in any way founded in a rational thought process?
"Yea, I added a new stereo player to my Lambo so its not a Lambo anymore". You are arguing that you "routed around Lamborghini" by installing a 3rd party add-on to the car. Yea, uh huh....**but its still a Lambo**.
Its still a bitcoin core work product and you've routed around nothing. **adding** to the source code does not remove all the other changes the source code introduces.
The heart of the argument is that you think changing a single line of code while implementing 10,000 lines of core's code is "routing around core"

The simple answer is they are not and so long as you use insecure hardware to access your private keys your bitcoins are at risk.
Also, the usage of internal CPU's as security mechanisms have been [proven to be flawed, creating security holes]( so even if newer phones claim they are "ultra secure" because of these 2nd or 3rd internal cpu's ......just wait. There will be exploits, and those area's we thought were safe were really just new backdoors for more persistent rootkits.

He was one of the loudest advocates of the attempted corporate takeover of Bitcoin, S2X.
He was constantly called out for his position and only ended up reversing it when he realized that it was not going to succeed.
These are not leaders. These are old dinosaurs trying to enforce rules that benefit their business in the short term to the long term damage to the ecosystem.
Voorhees provided valuable infrastructure to the old system. Centralized organizations should not be providing services that decentralized organizations or that peer-to-peer technology can provide in both a more secure, more safe and cheaper environment.
We can both recognize his efforts of the past and his damaging attempt to hijack Bitcoin through corporate takeover. I can both applaud him for his early work and lambast him for his crucial mistakes.
Note that he has had many chances to make a really thorough and fair apology for his actions. Instead he has attempted to rationalize his actions.
Are we really going to trust someone like that? He cannot even fully admit how wrong he was. To meet this person deserves nothing. It is a good thing that the technology has outpaced his business. His centralized services are no longer needed.

Yes, I didn't see that before, but then I added that edit before you replied as I now see the possibilities here. I actually had a good discussion of ways to accomplish this, and it can be done by anyone who has already received coins from the bip148 split.
For example, they can spend these bip 148 coins to themselves and also to some zero amount script that only says "op_true", so you have some tx where output 0 pays back to the miner, and output 1 is just a zero amount redeemable by anyone. If I want to transact on the bip148 chain, I ask the "service provider" (bip148 coin holder in this scenario) to tell me about some utxo that I can use in my transaction as an input, and it has to be on the bip148 chain only. So the provider tells me about a utxo, one of these op_true outputs, I use that as an input in my transaction and relay!
He was discussing maybe just using csv and locktime to make this into a automated script.
Should be possible, because we are assuming one chain will take longer than the other.
Anyways, thank you for the input!! Im starting to see how this is possible.

First, the evidence we do have is that there has been a sustained attack upon the bitcoin network with the goal being **only** to artifically increase fee's. 
Repeat after me ...
"There are not simple solutions to complex problems"
The only thing you have failed at here is to understand what these "simple" changes do to the system. This is not a black and white vacuum where you can make a change and that change is constant and the rest of the system is unaffected.
The reason you feel this way is simply because you are not armed with the technical faculties to understand the engineering tradeoff's of the system.
I've tried to provide you with the most condensed summary I've written on the topic. Hopefully it will make you think on your position -
Hopefully you can understand that changing a "arbitrary max" parameter has consequences, and those consequences directly involve the security of the network. If bitcoin is to remain resilient against state actors, then it must be designed and implemented with security in mind as **the first priority**. Your free coffee can come later with LN, drivechains etc, which is the whole purpose of getting SegWit through. The 2x is not necessary in any shape or form as *evidenced* by the above data on transaction spam and the fact that mempool has falled off the map within 48 hours of the SegWit2x agreement being reached, which is further proof that this was all manufactured by political parties interested in forcing their perspective by poisoning the well.
Now, for something a little deeper on the socio-psych level I've written extensively on the psychology behind this problem and why we have separate factions. It goes into depth on to the "why" of our social division, without going into the technicals of bitcoin. See -


Segwit is a reasonable path forward, the 2x part is reckless and needless. Some of the parties are naive to see this as a white flag, and those signatories are still responsible regardless of their ignorance. I am not war mongering since I am arguing for status quo.
What you dont understand is that there is a war already and SegWit2x is the opposition trying to take over the reference client. Im saying "we do not need this war".
Im saying we should reject this war before it even begins because its unneccessary. Segwit will resolve the problems for years. All of experts reached consensus on this path 2 years ago. All non-experts have made this into a political issue.
I've spent every day of my life for the last 3-4 years deep in bitcoin land trying to learn not just the technicals but the socio-dynamics that our system relies upon. I think that you should spend more time researching these subjects so that you can have a better understanding.

The game theory of bip148 is that it relies on the economic majority to transact on the bip148 chain so that it becomes more valuable and then miners switch to that chain.

@_date: 2017-06-03 15:05:28
I think this is worthy of its own thread, please help create awareness -
So I think that there are some misconceptions that needs to be cleared up regarding the difference between signaling intent and actual activation of SegWit.
As I understand it come August 1st there will be orphanage of blocks that do not *signal* SW. This means that from August 1st until November 1st(+ retarget period) when segwit is actually *enforced* there will be a several month period in which the transaction format stays the same yet there will be two branches of "Bitcoin" both conducting transactions that are compatible across both chains with no guarantee as to which transaction will make it into which Fork.
If there is no clean way to divide your transactions to ensure with a 100% guarantee that it will make it into bip148 chain vs legacy chain be then we will have systematic chaos. There is also a possibility of massive losses. What if your receiving funds from a legacy chain address to your wallet that gets picked up in the bip148 block but not the legacy chain and the bip148 chain dies off? That tx never happened and you lose your money. Not to mention even if we assume a best-case scenario in which every single miner currently signaling segwit mines the bip148 chain we will see blocks confirm at approximately 30 minutes vs 10 minutes. Now if we're not delusional thinkers we will accept that we will not have a maximum output of miners and instead there will be a faction that goes one way or the other leaving us with probably much less than 30% of hashrate. 1hr blocks is my best guess. We currently go sometimes 40 minutes to 1 hour with bad luck from miners with the current hashrate. That means that we may see four to six hour block confirmation times with bad luck on bip148 miners, assuming my best case guess of hashrate. Of course you have to mention that it will sometimes go the other way and we will get 5 to 10 minutes Blok confirmation times as well.
Either way the more I look at the basic assumptions of how this will play out the more cautious I am about it. In order for this to succeed it has always relied on large economic actors transacting on bip148 supporting nodes, and I don't see how this can be done without widely deployed ecological support from both wallets and exchanges.
I still support bip148 but we need solutions for replay attack protection immediately and that won't happen unless we educate developers on the present issue and make them understand that this caveat is currently a do-or-die situation.
I mentioned the issue to the mycelium developer and he said that they are essentially looking into it but gave no further information. I hope that electrum and all other wallet providers are also looking into this issue as well as exchanges, but I also fear that there is a status quo divided between wallets and exchanges.
It seems to me that according to the communications published by Major wallet developers they are all favorable to bip148, but so far exchanges have been very wary to make any public statements regarding this proposal. This makes sense because they wish to protect their customers and their Investments and that means maintaining the status quo and not encouraging something that would cause disruption and possibly large economic losses.
Unless we can get replay attack protection integrated into the proposal or broadly across the ecosystem fast then it doesn't seem that the exchanges are going to give their customers a choice on this issue.
Without their support I fail to see how this will be successful. shaolinfry stated right in the bip148 submission that economic support is a do or die scenario. I'm of the position that if we cannot rally the appropriate amount of economic support before August 1st that we should withdraw software supporting this proposal as to not ensure chaos within the network.
Honestly this reminds me a lot of the Bernie or bust movement. I liked the movement because it was a Grassroots movement that was trying to stand up to the status quo. And in order for your movement to succeed you have to approach it with a cult-like fever as to instill upon other people within the public your cultish fever towards accomplishing a goal that seems pretty obvious as to be with in the best interest of the community (SegWit). But if your movement only divides society and allows another incumbent to dominate, or even worse a new player to step in and take over the system that is even worse, then all your movement has succeeded in doing is to worsen the situation at the exact polar opposite of what you were trying to accomplish, which was to better the system.
These sociological effects are difficult to examine from a personal perspective when you're in entrenched in the ideology, but post-event you can look backwards and say "wow I really fucked up". I think that's what Bernie or bust people are unanimously saying right now, or at the very least they're thinking it inside their heads even if they don't want to admit it to all of their friends and families because they wish to save face.
Think if all the Bernie or bust crowd voted for Hilary right now? We would have a different president. And regardless of your particular political alignment this demonstrates how when you have a minority faction within a system who are cultish in their approach how they can skew the race and change the outcome. Please don't downvote me because you think I'm talking trash on your favorite politician, I am not I am merely representing the social divides and how they can change outcomes.
bip148 is that cultish social divide right now and I would like to see more discussion on the realistic outcomes that we will see after August 1st and how we will navigate these outcomes. We cannot succeed by pushing our heads in the sand and ignoring the problems that this movement currently faces, and we should be willing to shift our position if in the face of overwhelming evidence we see that this will lead to a negative and not positive outcome.
The way I see it there are solutions to these problems but with time being limited I'm not sure how realistic it is to implement these Solutions to Rally the support needed for a transition in the right direction.
Solutions for success -
1) replay attack protection
2) major exchange support (get a single one and it will snowball)
3) a compatible proposal like what Jeff garzik is working on or bip91/COOP that has compatibility with current bip148 installations.
If we cannot accomplish one and two then I do not think that we should support mining a bip148 chain. If number 3 occurs then I think it will make the situation significantly less risky if there is wide support across the ecosystem that actually installs that software.

Bitcoin core does exactly what you want it to do, what doesn't go your way is the economic activity of the free market. 
Remember, it's not Bitcoin cores fault fees are high. We have had a pending upgrade offering relief for a year now....? Who's fault is it that that upgrade is not merged? Are you really blaming open source developers for releasing code that fixes the situation?
This kind of delusional thinking is common to the crowd.
In your petty delusional mind Bitmain are heros right? Saints who have come to rescue Bitcoin despite the fact it is them and people like Roger who have made it their ideological crusade to stop the resolution to the problem?
Talk about being a fucking crybaby.....wahhhh....I can't run the open source software of my choosing wahhhh wahhhh.
Can't wait for all the stupidity about why we should have hard forked and Satoshi says nonsense. It's not like I haven't seen this idiocy everyday for 3 years straight
EDIT- Also forgot to mention Core has put years of research into improving the hard fork process. This goes against the "Core is against hardforks" premise that is so ignorantly perpetuated. They are not against blocksize raises OR hardforks, they just dont believe in doing it in a way that disrupts the network and leads to damaging effects. If you dont believe that, then ask yourself why the majority of Core developers have come against BIP148, despite the fact that it implements their own software faster?
You cannot criticize Core for wanting to be safe. You want to be reckless, fork your own shitcoin and make whatever changes you desire. Please leave bitcoin alone.

People have been perpetuating the falsehood that the rise/drop in mempool either -
* Is because the the price rallied/dropped.
* Is because people are fleeing bitcoin.
The digital currency group made their announcement about segwit2x on May 17th.
Full letter released may 23rd.
Bitcoin price continue to Rally upward until June 10th.
The [mempool started dropping]( on May 20th, had a slight rebound for a few days and then dropped like a rock on the 27th.
These timelines clearly show that the transactional volume was not related to the price rally and was fabricated by artificially inducing fee rates. 
If this is not the case then how do you explain may 30th to June 10th when the price was in rally mode but the mempool was in free fall?
Regarding people leaving bitcoin -
You can see we had just as much transaction activity in January and in March, with drops in Feb and April. This does not seem to indicate that anyone is leaving bitcoin at all and looks like normal ups and downs. Put the chart on 1 year and this becomes more apparent as normal behavior and does not indicate any fleeing.
Put it on logarithmic and it becomes even more clear -
If people are fleeing bitcoin, then why is the transaction volume the steady over time?
No one can deny that alt's transaction volume is increasing, but the question is for what purpose? For ETH's ICO's? Good. Bitcoin had "colored coins" years ago and we already went through that hype phase and dropped it. Lets leave those investment scam shitcoins and keep them the hell away from bitcoin. ETH and Vitalik are going to be in a lot of trouble when the SEC gets involved on all these investment scams. Very little of these ICOs are going to bring value back to the ecosystem and you can bet they are going to dump their shitcoins on the market and tank the price eventually without ever bringing back value into the system.
If that means bitcoin "lost out on the money" then **good**. Keep your scamcoins the fuck away from bitcoin. Let ETH absorb all of the trouble that comes with this. I dont see this situation as any better than the OneCoin scams.
ETH does not offer any other purpose at this point, other than shit ICOs and speculative purpose. People are buying houses, cars, hotels and food with bitcoin. As long as bitcoin continues to focus on censorship resistance it will retain its dominance and no amount of inflated coin supplies or artificially restricted supply chains can change this fact. You can always skew the numbers to look in your favor, but can you replicate real economic activity and bring real value back into the ecosystem?

I can agree with that to a extent, key words being here non-physical.


I dont think I implied economics wasn't real. Just that it wasn't a valid science. 
This is very easily disputed. Real scientists claim that psychology is not a science. Economics is simply psychology, as psychology is the underlying fundamental vehicle for economics. Its built entirely and solely upon it.
Everything beyond the fundamental is done after the fact. There are wild guesses and algorithms to try to explain the psychology behind humans, but its *not real science*.
Beyond that, I am personal friends with real global peer reviewed published genome researchers. They say its not a science, and since they are the most respected scientists in the world im going to just go ahead and take their word for it. People like you and me? We can debate until the cows go home, but none of it matters. The real scientists say its bullshit, even economists themselves admit its bullshit (bernanke admitted the ivy league school of economics was a farce, cant find the damn quote now).

Yes, I've been wondering about this scenario as well. I asked greg with no response here on his thoughts on the matter. I didn't really expect a reply however as its one of those bogs you dont want to wade into unless you absolutely have to.
There is still a chance that SW will be activated and the community wont come to consensus on a HF. Then core would still be the active reference client.


Which is 100% guaranteed.


Yes, and I wouldn't really mind all that much if that happened. As long as we continue to use the code that most innovates a positive path forward it does not matter the source. 
The first thing he said is what I've been saying all along (and getting heavily downvoted for) - That Segwit2x is just segwit with a few lines of code changed. 
I've had a army of trolls making wild accusations at me saying im tarnishing the truth by making that statement, going even so far as to say things like "You cannot even read code why dont you read the code and show me"...which, of course makes no sense since 99.9% of SegWit2x is code from Core, with 0.01% being parameter and activation changes introduced by garzik.

Jihan likes to play chicken with a lot of things and he's a lot of talk but when he sees that all the cards are stacked against him he will fold.
Now I would appreciate it if you would stop seeking out my comments and purposely trying to rile me up all the time. You seem to have an obsession with me and you're following me around is a little childish.

Thanks for clearing that up! I've had this question wandering around in my mind for the last month and it was wondering if you could answer it?
Regardless of whether or not it is rushed or lacking in Merit it appears that there is enough industry consensus to push Segwit2x through as an upgrade.
If this is successful and in August we navigate through Troubled Waters and avoid a chain split with a majority of the economy running Segwit2x, and all of these Miners and Industry continue running until a successful hard Fork (again, hypothetical)....
Will core release their next feature upgrade with the new consensus rules in place? Meaning will you guys adjust your code so that it reflects the block size increase that the majority of the community agreed to run? I know you are just one person and you do not represent the views of all of core developers but maybe you can add some insight into how you feel about that direction.
Thanks for your thoughts.

Ooop, there goes that argument. We can continue to ignore the elephant in the room, or we can pivot to recognize that bitcoins game theory has evolved with the technology and we must also evolve to combat non-incentive-aligning behavior or bitcoin will centralize and its fundamental value propositions will disappear.
Bitmain has clearly utilized its own greed *against* the health of the bitcoin network. It is difficult to take anyone seriously who thinks otherwise considering everything that has happened in the last 6 months.

In the end, I really dont care the way you misperceive the situation.
As long as we all agree to run Core's workproduct then I know we are mostly in safe hands. We are allowing disillusioned mob rule by increasing blocksize when we have no idea whether we will even need it in the next 3-5 years with SW + LN alone, and all I see is risk with little to zero upside, and that part sucks and you are part of that mob, and every inch the mob takes is a inch away from science based rational.
But as long as you run Core's workproduct, IDGAF what your perception is.

Right here when you claimed that bitcoin is 'routing around' core.


Im having a hard time dealing with your cognitive dissonance here.  You think "routing around core" is by installing their work product, SegWit?
Do you normally "route around" buying things from Costco by having your sister do your shopping....at Costco....for you? How is that any different than just buying it yourself? The product still comes from costco regardless of who gets it.
It doesn't matter who compiles the binary that reaches consensus. So long as SegWit is implemented then that means Core is the responsible party for the progress. Or do you think SegWit is not a core product?
Again, you have some really difficult delusions here and a extreme lack of understanding. This is however not surprising since I've seen an excess of shitposting from you many times before.

Its like AA said about UASF/BIP148, this is like a game of chicken ....you can win if you take off the steering wheel and throw it out the window in clear view of the other driver.
But this is not about lukes willpower, this is about a industry with hundreds of thousands of users. Lukes willpower is meaningless in face of that.


I agree and this was the point of BIP148, to allow the economic industry to decide what the market preferred. Since none of that has yet to materialize there is no real way to speculate, so no valuation can occur. Its currently in a catch22.

There's a common misconception being perpetuated that the bip148 chain faces no risks and that its only the legacy chain that faces the risks due to possible reorg. I think Jimmy quite correctly has demonstrated that to be false ....


Jimmy speculates that a BIP148 chain with under 33% of the hashrate is susceptible to empty block attacks and reorgs. So not only will your transaction take 1-2hr's to confirm on the BIP148 chain, but you also face the possibility of having your transactions wiped in constant reorgs because it will be so easy and cheap to attack the chain.
Bitcoin exists because it is anti-fragile. Any scenario in which there are large sums of money involved you should expect there to be malicious behavior that protects a particular factions economic best interest.
In this case you should expect Antpool and other Jihan pools to empty block attack any BIP148 chain. Both Jihan (asicboost) and [Gavin have gone public]( demonstrating that they do not feel it is immoral to behave in ways that are merely protecting your economic interests.
This means that empty block attacks are considered fair game to them and we should **expect** it to happen.
In this scenario a BIP148 chain will be extremely fragile and that is not a recipe for success.
You can see Jimmy and Dorier are at odds with each other, Jimmy thinks...


Where Nicholas Dorier thinks...


I tend to think that the strongest and most anti-fragile chain will win, in accordance to the nakamoto consensus. I think that ideological entrenchment has lead a lot of really intelligent people to believe that bip148 will be successful without properly examining all of the game theory scenarios and being honest with themselves as to all of the potential attack surfaces.
Anyone who assumes that miners will not attack other miners to protect their assets should not be trusted. We must expect bitcoin to be attacked and base our design and implementation around those attacks.
I think a even bigger problem is obtaining the hashrate needed for activation. 




I want to see SW activated as much as the rest of you. But I don't see the point in needlessly disrupting the network. I think its too early to say for certain that bip148 will fail, but unless we get more than 25% of the hashpower mining at slush or another bip148 pool, I really dont see how it will overcome these obstacles.
And for some humor...

This fails to address the elephant in the room....
This compromise is so we can implement progress. Yes there are strings attached, but those strings wouldn't even be able to be attached if it were not SW pending implementation.
The only reason this scenario works is because it's a minority veto scenario. If the majority of industry didn't want SW we wouldn't be able to compromise.
So this sounds like soap box whinging with a lack of context.
Think for a minute if the same WG proposed a HF for something that didn't already have wide spread industry support....it would be a non starter.

Yep, thats right and thats exactly what Core tells you to do. Hilarious how you make a enemy out of open source providers.
Users are free to install any software they want. Like Segwit2X for example which is 99% comprised of a work product from Bitcoin Core.
This is the typical slap lipstick on a pig argument. You are arguing that by putting lipstick on the pig that its not a pig. Just because Jeff Garzik adds a few lines of code in addition to *years* of work (segwit) does not make SegWit2x **not** segwit.
It just means that you fools think that the lipstick makes the pig a hot girl.
Yes, that means you, and You guys dont just drink the koolaid, you *fucking freebase that shit*.
Good luck with that mentality. Im happy that you crazy fucks think this isn't installing Core's product. You are so entrenched in your crack brained ideology that anything that Core puts out no matter how good it is you will refuse it because of your ego and pride. I dont give two fucks about your pride. So as long as all you kids keep thinking that installing SegWit is *not installing segwit* ....if thats what it takes to get it pushed through thats fine by me.
Keep on hailing it as "routing around core", im OK with that. I live in a reality where when you stick your dick inside that pig with lipstick that *its still fucking bestiality*.

Jihan continuously reminds me a certain politician who likes to open his mouth and shout things that are on his mind but are not reconcilable with reality.
A lot of bluster and posturing, but very little action.
How he could possibly think this is a good idea is really difficult to understand. This will only backfire.
He must love destroying bitcoins value because everytime he threatens to cripple the system like this it only causes negative price speculation and makes his mining rewards less valuable.
I dont know how anyone could rationalize dealing with this maniac. He should be ostracized from the industry. I wish there was a way that we could collectively block his hashing power. He is a poison to this system and we really **dont** want his "help". Bitcoin would be infinitely more healthy without his mining contributions.

I think the only way you can mount a convincing argument is to stockpile evidence.
If there really are so many people that have been over moderated / censored then it should be no problem getting them to come forward with their stories.
Make a post on and ask everyone to provide their evidence. If the issue is as strong as you say it is, then there should be no problem supporting your theory.

So is the distinction that is trying to be made here by the author of the article that Bitcoin succeeds not because of its intrinsic value but because of its medium of transport?
I'm only a little confused because I'm part of the article it discusses how it is assumed that in a society where there is no stores of intrinsic value competing with each other to be used as money that Humanity would surely pick up something that doesn't have intrinsic value to be used as money.
But that's obviously not the case in world of gold and silver and 100 different National currencies over the last hundred years.
Is the entire article written just to make Roger and Rick Look Silly by perpetuating the thought that Bitcoin must be a intrinsic store of value secondary to a network that generates economic activity?


Playing devil's advocate here but wouldn't this position now hold a better Truth for coins like ethereum that have low transactional cost with a bootstrapped intrinsic value?
Wouldn't this fit the definition of good money better considering the friction involved in Bitcoins transaction cost versus other bootstrapped intrinsic coins?

In ways, I feel the opposite. If you can expect one thing to be consistent it is the extent of human greed.

Then that sounds like if all the parties are in agreement and run SegWit2x, we will have lock in on the 27th-28th range which will give us roughly 3 days of breathing space before BIP148 can do damage.
Whats most interesting here is we have a use case where a minority veto creates a economic incentive. What happens if on the very last half of the day on the 6th day Antpool decides to suddenly remove their bit from their signaling and shorts the market?
I have a feeling they have already done this sort of behavior many times. I think bitmain had a enormous short on the market prior to UAHF announcement, and we have a history of them getting involved in LTC and suddenly doubling the hashrate by firing up their 1000's of scrypt miners and pointing it at a pool NOT signaling for SW.
So the behavior has been documented and established. They are definitely capable of it.
The question is....do all of these economic mechanisms create a better, or worse, bitcoin? Buying/shorting are valid instruments within a market for price discovery, but it appears that shorting is a extremely dangerous mechanism that can be used against bitcoin by miners when they are given minority veto abilities.
It seems to me that we must strive in the future to remove all minority veto capabilities from the process to remove such dangerous mechanisms from interplaying with progress.
Bitcoin works on everyone self aligning economic interests, but we now have 2 documented and established mechanisms in which a large counterparty is economically incentivized to work against the best interests of bitcoin users - Asicboost / Minority Veto + Market shorts.

How can you guarantee that this tx won't be picked up by the legacy chain? The only way this works is if you can ensure that one chain confirms and the other does not. 
EDIT - Because the utxo is on the bip148 only side right? And when its joined the other side will ignore it? did some more homework, starting to get it now.
Post Aug 1st legacy miners will accept txs broadcasted from bip148 miners because the transaction format is the same.
Even more frustrating is the fact that txs don't appear to drop out of mempool after 72 hrs now, so if you manage to get it confirmed on one and not the other, you cannot do anything until you know for sure it has fallen out of the mempool of the other chains nodes. I've seen txs either stuck or are being rebroadcasted every 71 hours keeping them in mempool forever. There is new behavior in core as of 0.14.0 about a 2 week timeout but I've seen txs stuck for longer than that so there's something funky going on.
Then, even if it does fall out and now you have to repeat the same process again and get it confirmed only on the legacy chain and not bip148 chain. If you can manage that great, but you are going to have to go through this insane process Everytime you want to move coins for the next few months.

Thats a extremely elegant admission that holds mountains worth of truth. 
I think that explains 99% of the problems we deal with today. I constantly say here to "not trust those who claim simple solutions for complex problems" and it is within alignment of that thought.


Unfortunately humans dont respond or behave in rational ways. I've [written extensively]( on this subject before.
There is plenty of research that explains the behavior, but not a whole lot of research on how to counter it. I've actually spent a big portion of this year studying how to combat these cognitive phenomenon that wreak so much havoc in our society. I suck at implementing the mechanisms because I've established a life of aggressive debating tactics, but my hope is that if I study them enough I will start to modify my behavior and fix it over time.

The chart you just posted actually says otherwise. The digital currency group made their announcement about segwit2x on May 17th.

Bitcoin price continue to Rally upward until June 10th.
The mempool started dropping on May 20th, had a slight rebound for a few days and then dropped like a rock on the 27th.
Are you still going to try and claim that the mempool increased with the price and dropped with the price when it clearly looks like the mempool was increasing with the price and then dropped like a rock as soon as consensus was found on a big block proposal?
How do you explain may 30th to June 10th when the price was in rally mode but the mempool was in free fall?

Right. Except everyone? You can speak for yourself, but the rest of the world can speak for itself.
Open source communities are built upon reputation. Society is built upon reputation. Reputation is only earned through identity management. Identity management can only occur *if you maintain an identity*.
Why do you think that the MimbleWimble developers have all taken, *and maintained* a single pseudonym? It does not matter who they were, only that a meritocracy is built upon them proving that they can write good code and engineer quality solutions which gives them more freedom to work within their peer group. Their peers are more likely to respect them and work with them in good faith if they establish and maintain a identity that is rooted in meritocratic work.
But if they switched identities every day, then it would be a nightmare. How could any trust be built? How are we supposed to establish trust?


Did you even read anything I wrote? I dont think you absorbed very much. The problem here is that we have large amounts of people who are not writing correct things and instead of being willing to challenge themselves they are running away and hiding behind multiple identities.
I dont have any problem with redditors of 0 hours coming on and saying rational things. Its the irrational and factually incorrect assertions and assumptions being peddled here every day that I take issue with.


This is not about me. This is about people behaving in good faith vs people behaving in bad faith. You cannot behave in good faith if you refuse to build a reputation and argue on behalf of your identity. If you are too much of a coward to stand up for your own argument and maintain that identity then you should not even be participating in this community.


This has nothing to do with political correctness. I cannot say I am unsurprised that you entirely missed the point. 
This has to do with being moral and mature human being and communicating with good faith standards vs being a immoral human being who is unwilling to take a stand for their position and instead communicating without good faith.
You are way out in left field on this one. You are making grand assumptions about so many different things here its difficult to respond to you. Basically, you've just got this entire thing wrong.
This is a sociological issue, its about communication. There is good communication (town hall meetings) and then there is bad communication (russians using sock puppet accounts to control narratives of their choice).
If you fail to see something this obvious then I dont really have the time to help you. You must first be educated and intelligent enough to see whats infront of your eyes. If you refuse to acknowledge even basic premises of communications then I don't think that you are willing to engage on this topic in good faith.
If you study psychology and sociology (like I do) then you would know that it is a waste of breath to engage with those who are only willing to see their own side and are unwilling to be open. You've demonstrated this several times in the past to me and continue to do so now. There is only a limited amount of energy im willing to expend towards you and its up.

I think this nicely sums up the entire "debate" bitcoin has gone through over the last 2 years.
I think this is all comes down to "Gavin says" and since Jihan and Roger wants big blocks and so does Gavin, then they are going to throw their support into their faction regardless of the incredible mountain sized pile of evidence against CW being Satoshi, because...well....."Gavin Says". 
It accurately demonstrates the **gross stupidity** of Roger and Jihan and how they are clearly enemies of a healthy ecosystem. They are essentially puppets with money and dont mind being abused over their ego's and naivety.

The Host opinioned that the SEC should just reject the ETF. Douche.
the guest explained that 90% of millennials prefer crypto over gold and that the demand is all there. He pointed out that there is a 30% premium on the grayscale gbtc vehicle and pointed out the hypocrisy of the SEC denying ETF on grounds that investors could be hurt while ignoring the fact that a 30% premium on this investment vehicle will surely cause hurt when it is wiped out.
A real ETF would resolve the variance between spot price and grayscale price. Investors who hold the bag on grayscale will lose. That is the risk they are trading for those premiums and they will eventually get burned.

I think to the perspective of most users this is true, or at least most educated users. To new users, it depends what they are taught is the value of bitcoin.
One of the first things I explain to newcomers is the fact this is a immutable ledger with hardcapped supply. Thats the brilliance that makes bitcoin shine and makes it valuable.
Inherent to understanding that is understanding that with changes comes the ability to manipulate these fundamental values. So if they are taught correctly from the start the fundamental values, then they see it as valuable and not the other way around.
Everything is simply a education issue.

Delete the whole thread if you want, but you should moderate people when they misbehave in such obvious ways here.
This has little to do with politics and everything to do with someone who is clearly trying to instigate and agitate people with no intention of adding to the conversation and *every intention* to simply create infammatory remarks intended to get a rise out of people.

August 1st is the deadline for **signaling support** for miners who construct blocks. It **does not enable SegWit on Aug 1st** and bip148 does **not** enable the enforcement of SegWit rules on Aug 1st.
I've posted a breakdown here and im looking for the community to engage in discussion on how we can overcome the current obstacles with a BIP148 UASF. There are a lot of concerns left to be resolved and we should stop spreading myths and start to address the real problems with BIP148 activation.

Yes, but in order for a IPO or acquisition to commence there must be projected revenue generation based on current business models and real world data. I don't buy it for a second that blockchain.info would get more than 70m if they launched a ETH ICO.

So you are going to rely on linear cost depreciation for a exponential resource incline?
Do you not understand the multiplying effect that increases to the BS has? 4mb is *not* just double the resource utilization of 2mb.
I find most people who hold this argument are not educated on non linear scaling costs.
If we were making 10x gains in a under 3 year timespan on the things that matter (RAM) then I might agree with you.
But we are not. We are barely positive on a linear scale. No where near the cost reduction needed to sustain the exponential growth that increasing​ the BS does.
Have you looked at academic research on this topic? The data is rather clear. I thinks you have not.
@_date: 2017-06-04 15:40:52


You mean the complicated "[solution]( you posted there?
Since less than 0.1% of users are going to be capable of doing that, how are the rest of users going to vote with their wallet?
The entire premise of bip148 is that it needs the majority of economic support to drive the $ towards the bip148 chain to make miners switch to the more valuable coin.
How can the coin be more valuable if.....
A) 99% of users cannot safely split their coins to sell
And 
B) Even if they do get them split their exchange doesn't have a bip148 node to accept those coins to sell.
There are some serious assumptions you are making here that have not been established by any real world data.
I will accept your statements at face value when there is real support to back up the premise. If you (or mycelim or electrum) posts software that enables users to easily split legacy coins and guarantees both chains don't confirm the tx....
Exchanges start to offer bip148 nodes for acceptance....
Then I will concede that bip148 actually has a chance in hell at succeeding.
Have we all forgot that the premise of bip148 is that it needs the majority of the economy? Where is this majority of economy supporting it? Without that none of the game theory is applicable because that game theory relies on these assumptions to be true.

Almost all of eths value is from ICO's and speculation. It is not used for anything else yet. Maybe later, but not now.
There is some lossage, but hard to argue that's the case with a all time high price and never seen before fee rates. These coins will all suffer the same fate Bitcoin does if they get popular enough so the entire discuss feels pointless to me.




It seems temporary to me. We have had miners obstructing progress preventing the solution to this problem you speak of. It's now resolving itself and is therefore temporary.

What an absurd argument. Its entirely irrelevant whether segwit2x gains consensus. The real progress (MAST, Schnorr, etc) is going to be done by bitcoin core and its the true engineering progress that determines which software people will run. Also, one cannot deny that segwit2x is just a implementation of Core's workproduct. Changing one line of code does not negate the 10,000 lines of code that went into Segwit. You can name it whatever you want, it will still be a bitcoin core workproduct.
The next upgrade, everyone will just switch their client back to bitcoin core.
Other than that, great article.

That's just implementation of full disk encryption for the users private data when the phone is off or when the lock screen is enabled. That will not prevent malware from obtaining anything within that encrypted data partition when the phone is unlocked. The whole aspect of malware is that its getting into your phone through vulnerabilities so any of their ability that gives the malware root privileges is going to have open access to that directory.
This will not prevent an anyway malware from stealing your private keys to your wallet.
I'm much more interested in the trusted zones (TEE's) which will provide a truly secure area in which even root level privileges on your OS stack cannot break into. Without this environment there is little hope that your keys remain safe. Some of the newer phones have a trusted CPU specifically for this purpose but it's only a few......
If your phone doesn't have TEE environment then you really shouldn't be putting awallet on it and holding anything of value.

Yes, but really how penetrated into brick and mortar is bitcoin? Not at all, so mobile is essentially just a cumbersome and dangerous practice right now. The security on mobile hardware is not where it needs to be to be a bank.
It was a contextual statement, meaning "mobile usage right now". I thought mobile usage is low comparatively to most bitcoin tx's. I still think im correct, but I would need to reinforce that with data. Its just a feeling based on where bitcoin is at and what its primary usage still is. There is no such thing as "coffee bitcoin" purchases, because what coffee places accept bitcoin? How many retailers of small items sell products to bitcoin that people would be using their phones to purchase?
All online retailers like newegg, tigerdirect, overstock, all the gift card companies...I would still think most of the usage is desktop based.
I think its important to remember that a large portion of bitcoin usage is still on drug markets. Which is primarily going to be desktop for security reasons. Speculation is almost all done on a desktop I would assume, which between those two makes up for the lions share of bitcoin usage. 
So it would seem to me that mobile usage is still quite low compared to the rest of the market. That will of course change as we get better market adoption, but I doubt we are anywhere near that. I would say at least 3 years out, maybe 5.

Im not here to advocate the ostracization of women in the tech society, but this is entirely relevant to the discussion so I thought it was worth sharing because maybe it could explain a small portion?
They modulated voices to see how often bias skewed the interviews. Even after modulation and using a control, they found that men, even when modulated as women, interviewed better. Similarly, they found that women, when modulated as men, interviewed worse. The sampling needs to be larger and further studied before drawing *firm* conclusions, but its looking like perhaps women in the tech industry just don't at this time and point do as well as men.

Nor does anyone, even the most experienced developers are merely guessing outcomes and they will admit so to you. Only a few ideologists like luke will claim to know the outcome, but they are wrong if they think they know the future.


I've been deep into bitcoin daily for 4 years and im still clueless about so many things! This is a complex system which is a unification of many different platforms (crypto, finance, game theory, computer science, etc) into a single system.
Only people like Nicks Szabo, who are polymaths (He has degree's in CS, legal, doctorate in sociology, etc) can truely understand these systems from a birds eye view. There are not very many people (if any) like Nick!
So do not be disheartened. This is something that you can dive into for years and you will still flounder at new turnings. Some new proposal will come out tomorrow and even the best of the best take time to absorb it, sift it through their minds and start to draw a mental framework on how it works. You should expect as a layman to take much, much longer to accomplish the same thing, yet to a much lesser degree of understanding.


While there is a hivemind in every subreddit, its a evolving thing that is susceptible to various factors, including the evolution of facts/knowledge on the subject!
For example, bip148 really relies on economic activity to thrive. The more companies onboard, the more of a reality it becomes. The closer we get and no major exchanges jump on board, the more I feel pessimistic about it.
Please take the time and listen to this podcast from AA on the issue, it should help you a *lot*.....

Right. And all the accounts who have kept their pseudonyms that regularly post contrarian views here?
What about them? Where are their bans? They shitpost all the time. I see them active every single day on this sub.
Where are their bans? Since there is some sort of conspiracy to control the narrative here so that its all pro-core pro-blockstream, why are all the shitposters at a all time high in terms of activity?
This illusion you call censorship has a different name that most of us know it by, its called "moderation" and serves a valid purpose. We dont want the despair and fucking misery that every single thread is over on so we have moderators who clean the trash.
This theory you have is proven false by the high activity levels of anti-core participants on this sub. Unless you think that there's a conspiracy stacked on top of another conspiracy and the moderators pre-selected anti-core members that they would never ban just to "fool everyone" .....?
Here's the problem. You are using negative evidence to support your claim. I dont mean negative as in bad behavior, I mean negative as in "the lack of". Like in film, how you have negatives and there is just contrast and empty space. 
Your "proof" is basically a lack of proof and you build your conspiracy theories upon this lack of proof. Yet you cannot prove this and the evidence that contradicts your theories you ignore because it does not fit your theory.
Sorry but you are wrong and every regular shitposter on this sub proves you wrong. I may think these shitposters are lacking in education and intelligence but at least these shitposters dont hide behind sock puppet accounts. At least they shit post *on their own accounts* and stand behind their words like men.

People that refer to bitcoins price as a measure of health are creating a false equivalence.
Bitcoins health has to do with transactional levels, support, progress etc. Price is mostly irrelevant to this. Yes, increasing price means increasing speculation which means more transactions. But this does not accurately measure the true value - using this system to transfer ownership or goods or services.
By the same token....claiming these people are "wrong" because bitcoins price is going up is the same false equivalence. This proves very little. 
Don't fall for the trap. Instead talk about technological progress. Talk about upcoming release candidates, features, community support, transaction health....etc. These are the true measures of value.

I agree with all of this but not the bikeshedding on the blocksize issue. Decentralization does matter to a significant degree. The reason bitcoin is valuable is because of its decentralization and long term value storage proposition.

Since we are discussing a *business* and not a *personal opinion*, yes, actually it does. Its by far the best way to cause business pivots.
Im sure you can think of plenty of examples where a business has made quick, significant strategic changes due to changes in the consumer base. If you can't, you've not spent very much time thinking about this topic and your replies won't be very insightful.


This is fine for your neighbor joe. This is not fine for a CEO of a business, especially when that "opinion" guides the entire businesses decisions that affects its customer base (and via proxy the entire usa), and doubly not so when it goes against [stated missions]( of the company.

This seems suspicious. Under what conditions will this company return dividends to its investors? They have a series a quite a while ago and I believe they raised 30 million and what have they done with 30 million dollars?
Build a wallet platform that has been plagued by bugs for years? I think the good thing is is that they have finally resolved all of their issues because I've not seen complaints about their platform in about a year so that's good news.
But I'm unsure how they're generating any Revenue offering a free wallet service. How are they going to return that 7 million +many millions more back to the people who are investing in them?
I recall this company and being part of that Coalition that is involved in blockchain Analytics. Considering that they don't have any obvious Revenue creating products one has to wonder where they are generating revenue from and that leads us to analytics. I think that it is not so conspiratorial to assume that they are selling blockchain usage data on the backside to generate Revenue.
Had they try to launch an actual exchange years ago I would have understood why there was so much money invested into them. Now I'm just not so sure.......

Ok, lets try this again now that my power is restored. Please understand that I enjoyed your article but i'm highly critical of most publishings in the bitcoin space since most are inaccurate to some extent, and arguing both sides (core vs classic vs alts etc) helps polish my stance on this crazy complex industry. So forgive my critique, I think you did a great job but the community needs balance. So here I am attempting to provide it.


Correlation is not causation. And you did not respond with any data to support your claim, or to refute that its just as likely remittance as it could be speculation. There are probably other use cases i'm not thinking of as well that can fit that category as well. But the case in point is that you've made a guess and not supported it with any data other than speculation. And saying "Transaction data supports it" is not data. That's called guessing.




Bingo! Now you are getting closer to the truth. It is not *volatility* so much as it is *practicality* that is preventing mainstream adoption. Since there **are** services and platforms that exist that help mitigate volatility for both consumers and business owners, then one must rationalize that it is in fact **not** volatility, but instead education + ease of use that is instead preventing mainstream adoption.
We can take a look at history for any number of examples to concede this point. Lets use the mobile phone for starters. Remember when it was a huge briefcase with a wire attached to this brick? And you probably had to dial all these crazy codes just to get the thing to work. There was a inch thick user manual on how to use it. Put aside cost for the moment since these are not accurate examples (bitcoin is cheap, phones in the beginning were expensive), and instead focus on the real limitations of the technology that prevented mainstream adoption ...which was *ease of use*.
Now lets apply the same argument to texting. Remember when all phones were qwerty/T9 ? Such a pain in the ass, damn nokia! How many people texted back when that was the norm? Obviously not many. It was not until the technology refined its *Ease of use* that texting became popular.
Or how about the internet itself? Dial up modems, screeching noises, constant disconnects, slow browsing. All things that resolved itself with refinement and which increased adoption.
Bitcoin is in the same place today. Right now its simply a immature technology that has not been refined. It has not been refined from a protocol level, and it has not been refined from a 3rd party bridge perspective, where exterior businesses have built bridges to the technology to gap the impracticalities to create a easier to use experience for the end user. We have started building the foundations. Payment processors, exchanges, companies that hedge and allow instant conversion between btc, alts and fiat are all examples of the 3rd party side.
But what about the protocol side? We currently have no easy multisig options (when I say easy, im thinking my grandma can do it), we have still difficult to use basic sending and receiving with lengthy addresses. Ironically, BIP75, which was introduced to mediate some of this was trolled on and "boycotted" by one of the more ridiculously immature actions I've seen from a *core developer*. While there are definitely complex ramifications in regards to AML/KYC, closing your eyes and going "nah nah nah I cant seeeee you" and ignoring the *good* properties of BIP75 was a mistake. BIP75 offers solutions to some of these impracticalities and these things are absolutely required for bitcoin to progress to mainstream.
So in ~~short~~ long, I believe you are incorrect. I don't believe volatility is the bigger issue, I believe ease of use, developmental progress and education is the issue. All things that are resolvable with effort and capital investment, things which are currently steaming ahead at full pace. I think claiming volatility is a obstruction for mainstream adoption misses the point and just confuses less educated people into thinking "bitcoin can never succeed because its volatile" which is completely untrue. 


Who are you to say that increasing block size wont increase adoption? Are you all-knowing? Are you connected to all the big businesses that have abandoned bitcoin for other blockchain tech (even their own)? How could you possibly make that statement when its impossible to verify? 
There are plenty of examples to provide, but at random im going to pick Heap's *Mycelia* project which aims to deal with musicians licensing rights through blockchain. **Not** the bitcoin blockchain., but instead they are going to [use ethereum](
Or what about the fidelity effect? Thats a commonly quoted one because of discussions between fidelity and Jeff Garzik. Fidelity wanted to jump on the bandwagon and start recording assets but pulled back due to limited TPS, according to garzik. 
Are we really naive to think that these are just exceptions, and that no other businesses have abandoned consideration for bitcoin due to its limitations? Of course not, that would be silly. There are many reasons.
And increasing block size *greatly* will increase centralization pressure, not minimally. There's plenty of research to support this claim. I dont have the post saved, but the data showed that we only lost 10% of our nodes when we went to 4mb and that we could jump all the way to 20mb + and still retain the majority of nodes. Im not saying we should do that, only that there is data that supports this stance and trying to make it black and white as it appears in the article without articulating both sides of the argument is biased reporting. Simply claiming "raising block size = centralization" is a misleading statement that lacks context and data, guiding the reader to make a explicit assumption on something that is not explicit.
The bigger argument here, one that I think you are trying to make, is that "big business" cannot jump on the blockchain without a *large* blocksize raise to substantially increase TPS, and I think thats also incorrect. I think that there is a enormous amount of recording that you can do on the blockchain with 2-4mb blocksizes that would be possible for big business, but the fact that *our blocks are full* stinks like high hell right now and steers away business.
No one knows whats going on with the fee market, things are getting expensive and businesses are going to analyze cost effectiveness when looking at which platform to use for their blockchain recordings. Bitcoin looks like a giant turd right now with our current conditions. Which could have been handled years ago with a blocksize raise (2mb) without affecting centralization and relieving pressure. 


A safe hardfork is simply one that has developer consensus. There's been so much politicking behind this that im sick to death of developers on this issue. They have flexed their muscles as a central planning committee on this issue enough to frustrate every single user on the planet. I've read statements from several core developers where they stated that (summarizing) so long as they are behind the idea's that hard forks are safe. Its just a matter of time for activation. There are already plenty of mechanisms (flagging, activation thresholds, etc) to mitigate these issues and this issue could have been handled years ago if the developers were more responsible.
I dont think the burden of proof rests on either side. Trying to polarize is like you have is irresponsible. I think that both sides have a duty to the community to have a open discussion on the issue and that whatever serves bitcoins best interest without hurting its core properties is the best route. 


I believe this a null argument. See next point and previous points.


Yes, a app that was built over decades. First we needed paypal to pave the way for online money transfer, the market was built, the bridges were built, the business connections made. Only after 10+ years of market building were then companies like venmo able to come in and participate effectively in the market.
Not because of volatility, but because of *ease of use*, something bitcoin has yet to solve. Venmo works because *its easy*, and bitcoin will similarly succeed when it is too, easy.

I am not, I think it could be ETH or bitcoin 3.0, whatever that may be.  The market is not rational and may choose something else entirely.




Its the opposite, that the more decentralized the harder it is to upgrade, and *this* is what makes bitcoin valuable.


Im comparing it to the entire industry. You are thinking too narrow. I said the technology industry. That includes semiconductors as a generality, computing devices, manufacturing of parts, everything.
Its a much better analogy to compare to.


Yes, and I expect that to change in the next countries crisis. Bitcoin is still a baby in the eyes of mature tech, it will come. That does not mean that it doesn't offer utility to these venezualans. The only reason they are not using it is because there is not awareness.

@_date: 2017-06-19 17:53:45


Hell fucking yes we care. Do you see the madness we have had to put up with for the last year over fee rates? 
So lets get this straight -
* Miners artificially increase fee rate while blocking upgrade that would reduce fee rate
* Miners use politics and claim open source developers that released solution are evil and bad actors and instead encourage horrible can-kicked-down-the-road "solution" that preserves their asicboost instead.
* Miners use stall and divide tactics to rile up the social bees nest and create toxic and hostile environments in the ecosystem.
* Then miners agree to run a proposal that gets their supposed "solution" even though by the time its activated it wont even be necessary and puts the ecosystem at risk for no apparent reason. All because a "opt in" upgrade that would have allowed the system to have lower fees and smarter scaling was blocked by them.

While this is a good point, I think that it, and these "researchers" at the IP office miss the mark.
Money-over-IP will drastically *reduce* piracy the same way that Netflix has reduced piracy. By trying to force everyone to pay for digital content through a frankensteined legacy payment system you will naturally isolate a large percentile of possible consumers.
But if your browser has money built into it, one click away?
We can see exactly how effective the freemium apps model is, that once you setup a payment system thats easy to use then users will buy more things.
When bitcoin is just as easy to use, aka, completely behind the engine so the user doesn't know its there, then it will help reduce the need for piracy as content will be more accessible than ever.

I'm not sure I would go that far, but I do agree it's a emotional instead of data driven conclusion. The reason this harffork had complications is because it was for such controversial reasons.

Applying the anecdotal as a general rationalization for something that is clearly apples to oranges is a illogical stance. I expected better from Sergio.
@_date: 2016-07-03 19:36:02
Yes, but also a little inaccurate. 


This is a misrepresentation of facts. Clearly SW increases block sizes by adding a additional container. If you have 1L of liquid but only a 0.5L container, with a tray that holds that container, and you decide to add another 0.5L container to hold that total 1.0L of liquid, you are still distributing 1L of liquid to that platform, the same way that adding a additional SW container allows for more hard drive space to be utilized across nodes for transactional data.


Where is the data to support this conclusion? This sounds like wholesale speculation to me. Using a strawman to win a argument may be effective to non-educated peoples, but I prefer data over speculation.




This is a strawman. Are there not existing platforms that hedge volatility? Are there not payment processors that offer free conversion of btc to fiat? Im not sure thats a rational or effective argument.




But then goes to say in the very next paragraph....


So which one is it? Is the lions share of bitcoin usage speculation, or as remittance? A 12-14BTC average transaction is supported just as equally as a remittance as it is as speculation. And yes, while bitcoins fee's have risen, it definitely has not risen enough that traditional remittance is cheaper....but I also think its important to remember that when you are challenging incumbents, especially globally established ones with their hands in pockets of the legislators, that you need to have some pretty serious advantages to your service to topple them if you expect to do it in under 30 years. Small advantages will not overthrow western union, and if you all dont think that banks are "innovating" at places like R3 to prevent exactly this from happening you are ignoring reality. Banks are going to adopt these technologies to create instant near-free transfers amongst themselves. The question is how quickly can they do it?
Can they do it faster than it takes for bitcoin to takeover market share from remittance? The answer is probably, yes, if im being honest. Which means that every penny is important, as every edge will increase market share and adoption. It also means that developmental progress at a protocol level is very, very important, and 2nd layer even more so, since its been pretty much concluded now that those are the real scaling solutions.

Since no one addressed this simple question I will. Bitcoin is in its infancy just like the internet was when dialup was around. It's supposed to be an apples-to-apples anaology. Since Bitcoin is still in its infancy surrounding its technology it is comparable to the internet when we had dial-up.

Bitcoin price yes, but we are talking about GBTC price here, which currently has a 60% spread.
That spread would quickly diminish with such a large competitor entering the market. The price would rise yes, but the spread would lower. 
For example, when we have rallies, the spread between btc-e and bitfinex gets pretty large. But as things settle down, we see the spread get to $1-4 as opposed to $15-30 like it does on bull runs.
I believe the reverse would be true for GBTC. As there is a bull run on BTC due to COIN launching, I think the spread would reverse, and we would see a large shrinkage in the premium spread, then probably a retraction back upwards after things die down.

which is irrelevant in the context of our discussion. I knew this would be the first response and I was hoping that you would have realized to not counter with that.
The context is about medium of transport. If we want to go deeper the context is about bootstrapping value through medium of transport, but since ETH has already bootstrapped its value, then clearly its a more efficient mode of transportation of value currently.

I understand this but dont see how this is grounded in reality. What indicators do you have that a majority of miners will support BIP148?


Right. By ignore you mean they continue to operate as usual. Meaning, they continue to run their current software thats already deployed and working great for them. There is little indication of any wide adoption of BIP148 by miners. If you have evidence to the contrary I would love to see it! Otherwise, it seems quite clear that the default mode of action "do nothing" is the most likely to prevail.
This is especially considering **it is within miners economic interests to continue collecting fees**. You can philosophically talk about how the price of bitcoin would be better without the fee's, but I dont see that as a rational point considering we are in a all time high pricepoint. 
The path of least resistance is the one that succeeds. Also, the path in which maximum compatibility is preserved is also the most likely to succeed. This is a complex sociological topic, but I would refer to Nassim Taleb's writings on the subject for explorative examples -


legacy miners can continue to mine legacy blocks under bip141 because its backwards compatible. In this example you have the most optimal scenario for success. But under the bip148 example you have a minority who is attempting to force rules upon the majority through coercion. Understand that I support core, support SW, support BIP148, but im calling it like it is.
In that scenario you reverse the truths illuminated by Nassim Taleb in that article. You are setting yourself up to be fractionated from society. This effect only works if the changes are compatible with the majority. They have to have the option to choose between their choice and the compatible choice. If its a non-compatible choice vs their choice, then group think will always prevail. Where this may not occur is if there are economic catalysts that can be shared amongst the majority to share the benefits.
As I previously posted in my message, how are these economic benefits going to be achieved without a market to speculate on?
I think you should respond to my response to you the same way that I responded to you. I did not fail to address your points and engaged on **all points**. 
Your response was not in depth and failed to address most of my concerns. Please respond in full [to my post]( to address these concerns. 


You mean the rules attempting to be forced by a minority? Why should the majority listen to the minority when there is no established economic mechanism to determine incentive?
This opinion goes against the economics of nakamoto consensus.

People who posit that there are simple solutions to complex solutions should be ignored.
I understand bitcoin quite well and have no issue asserting that there are complex engineering tradeoffs that are being made for the benefit of the network.
Its people who think its "simple" and think that non-educated people can just "make up their minds on whats right" who are causing all the problems.
So no, sorry, but I reject your premise as it has been demonstrated by the massive idiocy we have seen over the last 2 years that our ecosystem is filled with non-educated participants who absolutely cannot understand bitcoin well enough to make educated decisions.

Yes with Johnson in power and his plans come to fruition, private prisons would become the norm, and government prisons would be abolished.
He said that competition in the free market would bring down the price of prisons.
He talks about this on the Joe Rogan podcast. Joe brought up the human rights abuses that occur at for-profit prisons and how low-wage paying positions of guards is a big part of the problem.
Johnson had no answer for this. Because the whole idea is absolutely fucking idiotic. Private prisons are our worst enemy and he thinks that making them the only prisons are the answer.
Ironically the only way this could be a good thing is *if there are government regulations on prisons* that force the private prisons in line. Which would then require independent auditing agencies to verify compliance, regulatory bodies, tax payer dollars, etc. Which of course would never happen with Johnson in power.
Im all for competition, but not if competition sacrifices liberties to lower its cost.
Which is why government is essential. If you let the free market determine the outcome we will simply jump from Kleptocracy to Oligarchy (which is where we already are).

As with all things tech if there is not a multi platform widely deployed user friendly ability for an action then there will be little traction. bip148 relies on economic activity, so not only users publishing transactions to bip148 nodes, but also speculation in futures as well as users selling legacy coins for bip148 coins. Miners follow the market, which is comprised of users. If users cannot easily transact then there won't be the activity threshold needed to push the market in favor of bip148 coins.
So, you will absolutely need both wallets and exchanges on board. What good is your wallet that supports bip148 when your exchange does not? Your tx will not show up on their node and then you cannot speculate. Without speculation the market will roll over bip148 like dust.

What do you think happens to people who try to steal those lambo's or rob those houses?
They go to fucking jail.
There is a two tier system in society. Bitcoiners are not considered part of that special tier. They don't get special protection like bankers do who drive around in lambo's. They are regularly targeted, attacked, kidnapped, and get their shit stolen.
The bigger point here is that this wealth *can* be stolen digitally, and often is. Not that you are any less of a [phsyical target for kidnapping](
Think about it for a second -
You kidnap a banker, and then what? Ask him to transfer money to your account??
With bitcoin you don't need that. You can be kidnapped and beaten until you fess up your seed phrase or paper wallet, and then the theif gets away scott free with little trace.

if btc1 repositories become the social norm then all we've done is centralized bitcoin from a developmental point of view. This is not a good thing. 
We are much better off with a decentralized group of engineers like Core.
@_date: 2017-06-25 01:08:22


Bitcoin is a community project. It requires the participation of people from around the globe. Decentralized networks require cooperation. How can we upgrade the protocol unless we cooperate?
So you must except the premise that bitcoins underpinnings rely on socially constructed networks. Just because it is a piece of code that runs on machines does not mean that those people who run those machines are not humans and have no voice. The developers that write that code that runs on everyones computers are humans. The individuals who run companies that support backbone infrastructure, whether it be fiat bridges, exchanges, mixers, 2nd layer networks or whatever additional layered services you can think of, these people are all individuals and have voices.
Users who transact daily, weekly, monthly with bitcoin are humans who have voices.
We all have skin in the game and we all have voices. Consensus is hard, it is hard by design. Its a difficult process that requires social construct to move forward on. The system was designed with specific economic incentives in mind and those incentives have been perverted over the years with the centralization of mining.
We must accept these facts as they are and recognize that today things are very complex. Its complex because the bigger the system gets, the more parts it has and the more voices there are that attempt to be heard.
And we are all here in this place, on github, on slack, on IRC, on bitcointalk, your facebook group and wherever it is that you discuss bitcoin. Maybe its your local meetup's, maybe its a AA talk, maybe its consensus NY or whatever other convention is currently active.
The point is that you must accept that bitcoin is a system that is made up of humans. We run these machines and we have micro-decision impact at a individual level. And when we form our voices together our factions become strong and persuasive, as we do here on or or slack, or on github or on the linux mailing list.....we engage and debate and discuss topics we do it so that we can all come to agreement over topics.
It is fundamentally important that those who are engaging and trying to make their voices be heard are doing so on good faith. If they are not doing so on good faith then they are poisoning the discussion. That is a social attack upon the network and is a standard Divide and Conquer tactic that we must insulate ourselves against.
The post is not to "be the police" but instead *to empower the people* to be aware of the tactics that are in play right now. Do you think that what we are experiencing wont get worse?
Do you think we will never suffer larger scaled social attacks? As bitcoin becomes more and more valuable, the attacks upon its social fabric will become stronger and stronger and before you know it nation states will be involved (if they are not already!).
**We must recognize these attacks for what they are and refute them and stand strong against them**.
Are you aware that you can inoculate yourself against misinformation and propaganda? But in order to do this, you must *be first aware of the fact that it is happening, and what it looks like*. 
Reading on this subject -
There is also another method to help reduce bias and discrimination called "deep canvasing", you can listen to the research on the subject here -


What do you think this entire post was about? To bring awareness to the issue and to empower the people!

Bigger picture, you are probably right. I dont think bitcoin would serve as a replacement for traditional currencies at a national level, or at least there needs to be more research, data, and progression before such a thing could be considered on its merits. All I wanted to demonstrate is that there is a *lot* of capital flight into technology and technology is a naturally deflationary industry. 
It presents an example how a large industry can exist and thrive in a deflationary environment. 
The problem is that *economies* tend to not work well in a deflationary environment. That rule does not necessarily apply to currencies and industries. 


So was the computer for the first 15-20 years of its existence. You cannot expect bitcoin to not experience the same growing pains. This is totally expected and built into investors expectations. 


And there are now bitcoin based m-pesa competitors that are using this same exact mechanism, using phone codes to trade bitcoin. The issue is defeating incumbents in corrupt 3rd world countries, as well as getting a foot hold in marketshare.


No it doesn't. What makes things desirable or not for people to invest is the fundamental value or the utility of a thing. Bitcoin has deep fundamental value and is therefore desirable to people to invest in. It does not favor early adopters? They are already invested. There always has to be new capital and all that matters is that the system is progressing and growing and offering value to its users.


Again, these are growing pains. You dont think some new tech is going to disintermediate and disrupt a entire economy in under 10 years do you?
Our entire web of society is built around our financial institutions. This will be a long difficult battle, make no mistake.

I think the reason this is interesting is that it presents a use case for people transacting with suspicious counterparties on a legal basis.
Its a obvious green-light situation from a legal standpoint with him being a known certified white hat hacker who engages in transparent business practices. Yet here he is being routinely rejected by regulated entities because they are afraid of legal repercussions.
Isn't it a little ironic that bitcoin was created so that we dont have to ask permission with what we do with our money, and here we are right back to asking permission from someone to do what we want with our money?
This only proves how essential bitcoin is, how fundamentally valuable its services are to the world. Yes, it sucks that 2nd layer operators like Coinbase creating services on top of bitcoin are beholden to incumbent regulations, but its also beautiful that if you want to, you can avoid all that and not have to deal with it.
Whats stopping this guy from using his coinbase account to purchase, then sending it to a web wallet or Core wallet, and then using a coinjoin service like blockchain.info's or JoinMarket to add fungibility to his coins before sending them to less than reputable sources for his clients?
If I recall correctly one of the US exchanges, coinbase I think said that they use analytics of 4-5 hops on transactions. As long as those 4-5 hops are not connected to places on their analytics companies "big bad dont do business with" list, then coinbase should have no legal or techincal reason to close his account.

Consensus must be found through the users and Cores job is to provide excellent work product through an open source collaboration.
I'm really surprised that you've been here this long and you still don't understand this. And I think that this is really one of those key issues that most people just simply cannot wrap their head around. This is a decentralized group of open-source participants who are collectively working together to engineer solutions to a decentralized network. You are still in central authority mode and that's your problem. This is Bitcoin not PayPal.
They cannot decide for the users which software they run they can only advise on the technical merits and Hope that the economic incentives aligned within the system will nudge people in the right direction.

It's not that I personally would have disbelieved your post had I seen it, it's just that there are definitely variations within the mempool that can account for the lessening of transactional costs on a week-to-week basis.
Now that we have had a consolidation period over several weeks which demonstrates a consistent lack of fee pressure I think it's much more clear now that we have been under attack for a very long period of time. Lots of BTC wasted assuming that miners were not the ones engaging in the attacking and just re collecting a portion of their fees. If antpool was behind this then they had a considerably cheaper efficiency on transactional cost of attacking the network because they can gain back a large portion of their spending's.
We now have the industry a greeting to implement a solution device behind closed doors by men in suits that is not a reference client from core.
This shows that their move paid off and the constant economic pressure they put on fee cost had a dramatic effect not just on users and those engaging in the social sphere but also upon industry members.

Which is exactly why it's worthless. All this does is add biased narrative to something that has no scientific merit. It just fuels stupid people with no rational thinking skills into believing something that they should not.
For example The weighting given to bitcoin.com is clearly a biased metric that has no rationale in the real world. It's glaringly obvious that that is the case yet here we are today with it claiming that it has more weight than bitstamp.
That should tell you right there that the algorithm that determines it or the people behind the algorithm that determines it are clearly biased and are not giving due consideration into the weighting system.
In this case it's much better off to have no weighting than it is to give a miss representation of real-world data.

Yes, and all these people are idiots and you shouldn't listen to them. 
The only reason ETH surged was this ICO madness. Its the dot com bubble all over again, people throwing money at shit stocks / shit coins / shit ICOs because they want to jump on the investment hype train.
But 90% of these will fail and dont offer any value to the ecosystem. What will happen to the price of ETH when these ICOs start dumping their coins for their shit company that doesnt bring any value back to the ETH or crypto ecosystem?
What happens when the SEC steps in to the massively centralized ETH development and holds vitalik personally accountable for all these scams?
Are you really suggesting that it would have been better for bitcoin to host this shit ICO craze?
If so, then why have you forgotten about "Colored Coins" ? We had this same exact hype cycle in bitcoin 3 years ago. It was all about the colored coins mannnn! You can use them for anything! You can make them shares of a company and do IPO's mannnn!
Except no one really did. And I see that as a good thing. It prevented shit and misery from piling up in the ecosystem.
This "value" that you think exists doesn't. This "dominance" that you think exists doesn't. You clearly dont understand these marketcaps.
Lets not forget the reason this entire mess started is because miners politicized issues and abused their position. We have had the solution to these problems pending for a year now and the only reason its not active is because of a cabal of chinese miners and non-well intentioned inviduals in the ecosystem creating political platforms stalling progress over a **optional upgrade**.

I too thought this but as we closer the more I think that there will be very little disruption from a bip148 split. A fork is irrelevant if there is not substantial economic activity backing it. The economics of Bitcoin are still intact and miners will only build on a non-bip148 orphaned chain if there is economic gain.
So the question is, what miners are best suited to risk mining a chain that has little economic backing?  Really only manufacturers in 3rd world countries with near free electricity .....so....Bitmain?
Can we really expect bitfury with it's 1st world costs combined with a roughly 1% margin rate to risk losses in this endeavor? That does not seem a rational economic decision. There would need to be an overpowering ideological motive which I do not see any evidence of existing.
So in short I think Bitcoin will weather this storm with only minor disruption and with the right market factors we might even see gains. There's a lot of steam in Bitcoin right now.

There are plenty recent examples of corruption within the trading side of Bitcoin. From exchanges stealing people's money or Insider trading to internal bots front-running orders.....
Bitcoin does not create immunity from human corruption. The corruption lies within the framework that we create. So long as humans create the framework there will be corruption.
Whether it is a traditional forex Market or a Bitcoin exchange both are prone to human corruption.
I do have some hope in decentralized markets based on multisig contracts alleviating some of this pressure, although it can never be eliminated so long as humans are involved in decision-making processes.
These same banks will find a way to corrupt Bitcoin. We have already seen the start of it with futures and paper trading. If they cannot corrupt The source they will simply create a proxy infrastructure that they do have control over and lobby to enforce the rule sets around the structure. If their network becomes prevalent then they don't need to corrupt crypto they just need to take control of their own systems.
Typical command and conquer.

This is semantics that is not representing of factual real world data. You are basically just saying "A split will *only* occur if legacy miners continue to mine the legacy chain"
That is quite obviously going to happen. There is a clear majority of legacy miners who are going to ignore bip148 and continue mining the legacy chain. So a minority of miners (like at slush) will mine a bip148 block and then build on that block ignoring nom SW signaling blocks. That's a guaranteed chain split.
In order for your assumptions to be true here there would need to be a majority of bip148 miners. 
Are you saying that you think there will be a majority of bip148 miners by August 1st? The data clearly shows the opposite. The only way there will not be a split at this point is if COOP/bip91/Garzik (any bip141 compatibile proposal) gets endorsement from the Barry WG and widely deploys it before August 1st.
That's the only rational condition in which I can see a chain split avoided. Do you disagree, and if so what specifically is wrong with my perspective?


Its possible you understand a lot more than me on these issues and I posted this so that I and the community can learn, but I'm not following you here.
Why could a bip148 mining node not see a *transaction* broadcasted? I understand why they would not see a block, but the scope of discussion is transactions during the grace period and transactions from the legacy chain or bip148 chain are identical until SW fully activates and there is a new transaction type. But during the grace period all txs are equal, are they not? If not please describe how they are different.


This can only happen if exchanges support bip148. If this does not occur then there is no market mechanism to determine value. How can miners evaluate their most rational economic choices when only one option is present?
Obviously my stance on this point will shift if major market makers implement a bip148 node and wallet developers implement user friendly methods to send from legacy to bip148 wallets.


Like, I've been active in this space 4 years now every day of my life deep in the Bitcoin sphere and have a 15 year background in IT. What you just described is well beyond the scope of more than 99% of Bitcoin users. I might be able to manage that but even then I would need to put my trust in others more knowledge than myself to ensure that I'm doing everything right. 99.9% of bitcoiners are not going to be willing to spend the time learning or doing.
In order for bip148 to succeed there must be enough economic activity on that side of the chain to move the need in favor of bip148 amongst markets. This cannot happen without widely deployed infrastructure from both wallets and exchanges. If people cannot easily move coins then coins simply won't be moved and then they won't be speculated with. Without that how is bip148 coin going to be worth more?


I agree with this perspective but how are we going to ensure that the same transactions get included on both chains? I think the obvious answer is there is no guarantee that both chains will be in sync confirming the same transactions. Without this guarantee then this position that you hold does not seem rational.
I would also like to point out that this appears to conflikt with your earlier statement that Legacy transactions cannot get confirmed on the bip148 chain. Either they do get on both or they don't. Which one is it?

Well, the scope is different and that changes perspective, but I agree with your point. The irrational response that because something might be near X so I dont want to be near X is a problem of the pysche not understanding the internet. Its about a realm with no borders. If you thought "I dont want to be near paris because there was a recent bombing" I would be ok with that, because that makes sense. But in a realm without lines or borders, it does not make much sense to have this attitude. Even if it is contained in some code that partitions itself into a network.

Yup, I agree with all that.
Are you trying to claim like these other fools that when you take the source code from core that you are not implementing Core's work product?
Thats their claim and what you chimed in on. 
You cant "route around" using someones source code. You either do or you dont. Yes, you can make changes to it. But if you change the lamps on your ferrari, is it suddenly "Johns Brand Car" and no longer ferrari?
No, of course not. Its still a ferrari. And no matter how much you customize it, *its still a ferrari*.
You can add tiny implementations like changing the BS parameter, but that is not changing SegWit. Infact, the WG's stated goal is to push SW exactly *as is*. These kids must not be reading very much...
As [Jeff Garzik Said](


You are not so delusional as to think that the person who is implementing SegWit into SegWit2x is *not implementing segwit*....? He stated quite clearly he is implementing it. Anyone who denies SegWit is core's work product is living in a heroin fantasy.
He clearly stated Segwit is the "long term foundation for bitcoin"
Doesn't get anymore fucking clear than that.
I dont think these kids know the first thing about writing code. I dont think they realize how much source code SegWit is, and how little SegWit2x goes beyond that. The only code thats changed is activation methodology, and a **one line change to BS parameter**.
These kids just dont have a clue wtf they are talking about. They dont understand the difference between protocol level changes and activation methodology. Theres a massive difference here. You can change the code on how to activate SegWit all you want, but SegWit is still Core's work product and so long as we get that installed we are running bitcoin Core's work product.
No amount of lipstick changes that.

You are setting up a argument for PoS. I disagree with this perspective. Holders don't determine economic activity, users do.

For speculation yes but for utility no and that's why there's not very much to worry about. When you utility becomes a problem then we should definitely have a sit down and talk about the future of this industry. However I don't think that that's going to be the case considering the pending upgrade and the bright future ahead of us. The timing of the men pool being cleared is also good for this discussion because it shows that we are finally no longer under attack since we've reached consensus on the path forward.
Also I think your utilization of learned helplessness is being incorrectly applied here. In this situation learned helplessness would actually mean that people who have become convinced or despaired that the situation is unresolvable will behave in a default mode.
The default mode being they're going to continue doing what they've always done even if it means a punishing affair. That means they will keep using Bitcoin the way they always have they will just be resigned to paying the fees which I think is pretty clear since fees are have been at an all-time high.
Learned helplessness was demonstrated first in the seventies on dogs where they would shock them and then try to teach them to jump over a wall so they wouldn't get shocked. But the ones in which they didn't allow to jump over the wall where they shocked them for a period of time when they put them in the room where they could jump over the wall they refused to do so because they have learned to be helpless.
So I disagree both with your philosophy and with the utilization of terminology here.

And you think deregulating it further would have somehow un-shielded them from liablity? And where is the basis for your claim that they were shielded? [5.5 billion in settlement]( doesn't sound like "shielded" to me?
You'll have to explain that to me because it sounds non-sensical. If this business model was deregulated and further privitized it would only lessen the ability of the public to go after these companies for liabilty.
Also further regulations would create more business opportunities (e.g. more drilling, which is *exactly* what we have seen with Trump) which will lead to *more* spills and more environmental disasters.

How does that make it a "quasi" web wallet? I see this as a good thing. 
AFAIK the security is "offline" because its in-browser local javascript. You cannot really call this "online" since its doing all the security in a sandbox offline.
First link is a iphone bug, I dont see anything serious there.
Second link he says in the edit "but it seems likely that my blockchain.info account wasn't the one that was compromised" ...so not related.
3rd link sounds like the person had a faulty connection. This is the danger with in-browser javascript offline security. If your browser thinks you are connected but you are not, you risk everything if you send coins or generate a address and its not synced.
Im not so sure that this has not been addressed already however.
