The intention to stop inflation and replace bolivar with crypticurrency along with the intention to prohibit BTC mining is paradoxical. It’s impossible to manipulate crypto like these governments do. They can’t stop the progress. Even after the ban, China has the largest mining communities thanks to a cheap energy. Nothing radical will happen here, too.

 I would also add CEX (r/ to that list. IMO, this exchange deserves to be named as "the best". It's quite convenient and practical and has rather low fees.

 There are about 50 packages of hardware, right? That's impressive. Kazakhstan has a cheap electricity, as far as I know, so you may get a lot of profits. Time to destroy the Chinese hegemony and create mining farms in KZ to produce even more coins? :D

 I agree with zcOfficial. Moreover, I think it would be great to hold a poll that would show the expectations of your users. For instance, as a trader, I appreciate high security of my account, global coverage, cards support – all that is available at CEX, (r/

 Correct me if I’m wrong but it’s the best moment to buy BTC, when the market is controlled by bears. As I understand, bear market means low prices in comparison with bullish periods. Surely, prices may go down significantly but it’s still better to get BTC when the market is red than purchasing it during green season, right? Anyway, I'm gonna get some crypto this week and I want to know which exchange is better: CEX.IO or Kraken. Both offer fiat-crypto deals and have good reviews. Any ideas?

 As far as I know this exchange works quite well. So, most probably it won’t be so easy to suggest you decent replacement. Maybe you should pay attention on cex (r/ Coz when it comes to terms and fees, I can say that it’s quite transparent there. As for site that comperes exchanges, I’m not sure that I know any particular place to suggest. Just try to read as many reviews as you can to make your own conclusions.

 What I have learned is that no one system can be perfect. There are always loopholes to go round the system. The difference lies in the level of security. Some systems are less secure, others are more secure but none is 100% insured from the attack. In terms of security, decentralization is a winner. Block propagation and number of orphaned blocks must be optimized because they really threaten the decentralized system of bitcoin.

 Before choosing the platform, make sure to get a crypto wallet for storing Bitcoin safe. You can choose one of the largest and popular exchanges to invest in Bitcoin but they don’t fit for long-term storing. Keeping coins on the exchange is suitable for trading, but the main storage should be your private crypto wallet.
