Thanks Olga, 
Why did CB change how they coded the transaction to "cash advance" from a regular purchase? We're being fee'ed twice now, on your side for the higher fee and now on the bank side for it as well. Weren't we already paying a higher price since it was a credit card anyway? 
@_date: 2018-01-28 14:37:40
Both coinbase and chase say it's coinbase. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:26:39
Chase debit card? That's really weird that you were charged a cash advance fee, can I ask how much the fee was? And that was on your checking account or on coinbases side.  You should DEF be ACH transferring from a checking account though, you're throwing away money using your debit card, since it still gets the credit card fees.
@_date: 2018-01-21 05:13:57
Blackwallet hack it looks like, 
@_date: 2018-01-22 04:35:02
Yeah, that seemed to be what my research indicated. :/ I might stick one on my server just to mess around. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 05:06:59
They changed how they charge CC's the other day. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:51:34
What's the industry? 
@_date: 2018-01-20 04:51:39
I could see this.
@_date: 2018-01-21 03:15:39
Yeah but you basically blink and bitcoin price jumps enough to cover the fees. Sell, pay off the CC, love those free credit card points. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:31:31
Ooo smart, I need to update my limits. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:19:15
This guy is such garbage, he only gained popularity because he has a great PR person who gets him booked on TV shows, (which actually is pretty easy to do), now my FB is filled with his company and their get rich quick schemes. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:54:09
Lol I just got off the phone with my bank.
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:41:44
I think they are just turning on user registrations at night, during their slower time and then shutting off during the day seems to match the times now.
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:38:28
It’s for churning. We don’t keep the debt on our cards for more than 3 days. Sometimes even same day swaps.
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:43:28
Weirdly, my business credit card doesn't show up on any of my three credit reports. It's gotta be somewhere, but when I look it isn't.  I used my EIN number vs my social when I applied. 30+K Line of credit, just missing. lol

F for fluctuation.
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:58:45
It can sometimes take a few days, my broker sent me a notice telling me they were pending.
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:22:02
Coinbase is slowly rolling it out, so whenever CB blesses your account. ;) There's no way to speed it up.
@_date: 2018-01-13 03:00:05
They were on two nights ago for like 4 hours. :) Got one!
@_date: 2018-01-27 03:52:32
Lol well it did until a couple weeks ago or at least had swings in that range.
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:51:14
It's not even them impersonating the person, it's them impersonating an employee at the local store level requesting assistance with the customer. Thus the other employee trusts that they've already had their details verified. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:12:27
What bank?
@_date: 2018-01-20 03:04:29
Yeah, you're probably going to run into issues with coinbase/gdax also. Hopefully the few people that are getting paid in BTC will chime in with their workflows.
  
The problem is that institutions aren't just 'businesses' they are going after hedge funds, big money, high frequency trading, etc ... Look at their description of what their definition of institutions are.    
  
Having said that, and not that you asked but, I'd just setup a recurring bank transfer to automatically buy with crypto from your bank account every week. :/
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:48:33
I'm in NY was just verified, 
@_date: 2018-01-22 04:27:53
What's the profit like operating a lightning node? 
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:40:07
Hmm I have enhanced verification, is there a chance it's still pending? Took 1.5 weeks for mine to clear.
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:17:27
If you can get a chase sapphire business, and then register for a free EIN number, that's the way to do, that card is treated as a business card and doesn't report on my CC. So you can max it out with minimal impact.  Buy sell repeat. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:12:57
Oh yeah. :) Finally, I knew the jump was only around the corner. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 05:33:34
:) I've been surprised how many people aren't. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:38:58
Really? Who’s is better? I love it.
@_date: 2018-01-20 04:53:35
Just did :)
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:54:48
Was yours chase also or different brand.
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:21:07
Though the argument could be made that a short while those own currencies were no where to be found. ;).
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:02:27
Nope, you don't earn points on CA's. :( 
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:37:54
But you earn the % back... and the points are worth more than the exact dollar equivalent.
$25,000 spend on coinbase = a free round trip overseas flight.  If that took me all of 5 mins to do, is that not worth it?
Btc easily rises that 3.5% in a couple days.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:56:22
Someone watched Mr Robot.
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:18:06
I did ask, coinbase switched it, not the bank.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:17:11
Not sure, however read up on CreditKarma and Tax forms, last year they were notorious for not having all the forms and options that everyone needed.  Basically their service was only for pretty basic tax filings.  
  
So they may or may not have the right BTC section.  
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:08:43
Haha no way, that's a crazy short conference for $1km though could be a fun drinking game listed to how many ICO's use the same exact script. ;) 
  Looks like a garbage conference. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 05:29:05
It doesn't. However you should def use a card that gives you points. :) Might as well get some free vacations out of all this btc buying, rinse &amp; repeat. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:47:13
Why? I can deduct the fees and I’m just earning a ton of frequent flier miles. I only own it for a week with the CC. :) 
@_date: 2018-01-20 03:42:15
Love it! :)
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:54:36
Yeah they totally could be lying, but they said it was how the transactions were being sent to them and how they were coded. 
Yeah I was honestly surprised we got away with it for so long, but oh well.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:19:12
Until someone else comes out with an interface as great as GDAX and lets me buy with a CC, I'll be with coinbase.  (Also if you know of one, let me know). 
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:05:32
I've only tried it with Chase, going to try with my amex later.
@_date: 2018-01-20 04:49:47
Chase Sapphire Reserve is solid, I have them for all their other perks, but yeah five figures in crypto transfers. No problems so far.
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:38:00
I’ll have to dig around for the IRS doc, but my understanding you’re allowed to deduct bitcoin transaction fees, just like you would with other property investments.  My accountant feels the same way.
  
So when I buy 9k on my CC, I pay 300$ in fees and only receive 8700$ in btc, I can deduct the 300, but I usually wait till the value goes up to 9400. So I would pay taxes on  the $700 gains.
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:13:55
I do, and it's AWESOME as of yesterday, same day withdraws from my CB account started!  Sent a transfer from my CB to my BoA account at 9am, and it was in my bank account by 8pm that night.  Deposits still take a week tho.
  
My buddy has instant buys enabled on his account with BoA.  
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:34:45
Yeah none of us in this thread have had the problem till yesterday. And have had plenty of card transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:30:06
Yeah I do that already, the credit cards are just for churning the points. :) Free vaca’s.
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:24:34
Yeah np, You'd probably want to send it to your checking, you're limited to the amount of withdraws to a savings account per month or they flip it to a checking account.  
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:49:47
Yeah, and takes like half a day to make it all back and some profit. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:45:00
I’m all out of CC stuff now, again only held it for a couple days each time.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:54:45
Yep! 
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:49:52
Yeah I wouldn't do this, I would however set recurring transfers into btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:45:08
Go through the process and request a higher limit, I requested a higher one on both coinbase and gdax.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:09:05
WTF this is an AD? lol let's just slip CoinMetro into there, yeahh wouldn't touch your platform at all now.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:07:11
Ah yeah, no problems for me thankfully, just finished the enhanced verification as well. However I wouldn’t leave money there for a long time though. Just temp.
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:35:05
Why don't most bitcoin ATMs offer withdraws? This seems to be the missing link, and if they do, just the ones in my city seem to only offer deposits. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:10:47
Are you in the states? Did you use google maps to see which one was closest? Yeah I had no problem getting an account on both exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:11:09
That's about normal,ish do you see it 'pending' on the bitfinex side yet?  how many confirmations do you have on bitfinex?
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:34:55
I think it will behave like an IPO, cause a massive POP, and then will drop 10-20%. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:33:17
Depends on your bank, most banks will re-open your checking account and charge you fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:00:42
Totally, Venezuela doesn't like that it's loosing control of its currency, lots of places love the btc down there.  They will create their own and then (speculating) ban all others.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:52:08
Nothing on google or twitter, I swear half the news in this subreddit is fake.

@_date: 2017-12-28 17:51:06
Lol so we stick our btc in bittrex for 24 hours, big deal. Never hurts.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:31:59
What did you delete? Your wallet.dat file?
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:25:56
Let the man dig! 
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:57:01
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:53:12
It's time based, so if your withdraw is 7k, and you withdraw all 7k on Sunday, by monday you'll be able to withdraw 1k again, tuesday, 2k, wednesday 3k, etc...   But would take a full 7 days to reset back.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:28:03
It’s also people moving their coins to exchanges that we believe will support the whatever2x fork. Lol
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:32:37
I should have said their corruption I guess.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:19:08
Looks like Bloomberg is  
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:09:21
My understanding is the more transactions and the more adoption of the coin is better for the overall health of it.  So I think it would be negative. Plus it would even worse for their people. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:37:50
No need a local email client.

Call your bank and have them whitelist the exchange. I had to do it for one of my cards last night.  Tends to take 12 hours to go though sadly.
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:58:13
Who won? Lol Uhh def one step closer to banning bitcoin if they are creating their own. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:12:04
Tip use the coinbase app when it crashes to buy more btc. The app tends to work as it routes through different servers.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:57:29
This type of news isn’t good for us. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:48:05
Ahh they are all doing that now. In the states our news channels are running 24/7 cryptocurrency adds now by precious metals companies.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:59:22
I haven't had any problems with Bank of America, Chase and Etrade.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:26:16
Eh, I think people are more trusting or ignorant about it. Like I constantly see the fake, ‘there was a fork get your bitcoin diamond platinum for free, just give us your 12 word passphrase.... ugh.   
Think of all your coworkers and friends, unless they ask you they won’t be able to figure it all out. It’s the Wild West. Lol
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:40:41
Not surpassing, plan on wayyy more restrictions, Venezuela isn't happy at anything that could threaten their currency.

@_date: 2017-12-08 02:52:23

No, pay your damn taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:01:12
How many days exactly? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:03:34
Old news 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:22:08
Not much, if there's one thing the IRS is good at, it's getting their money.  Plus I believe most US people are doing business with US companies, all those ICO's require your passport usually, your bank has a record of all your large transactions and tend to report huge sums as to prevent any laundering/trafficking.  
So unless your plan was to get btc annonmously and spend it overseas, then better report!
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:00:01
It's because of the crash, people can't change their stop loss orders and it gets triggered like a domino effect, no way you can stop them if you can't log into the site.  That's why stop loss's are dangerous. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:44:10
Stupid question, when was the last time you closed and re-opened your wallet on the receiving end?  Exodus for instance seems to have a horrible time reupdating transfers while its open for me. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:12:06
Are you trying to create a 2nd account on gdax? You should be able to just click 'login' while you're logged into coinbase it and it connects to your account. 
@_date: 2019-10-25 11:46:49
I hope so.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:08:14
Did they submit more verification? What's it asking for?
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:58:07
On the GDAX "Deposit Funds page":" Bank account transfers will be credited to your GDAX account in four business days."
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:51:59
Click "Receive" under bitcoin, it will show you a string of characters, that's your wallet address.  But again read the whitepaper, not all wallets are compatible with each individual ico. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:35:46
A tad more detail ...
Sanders was asked about Trumps opinion on Bitcoin, and she answered: "I don't have anything to share with you about now, but we're monitoring. Homeland security has brought this up and we're monitoring."
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:47:26
When you add a CC it does a pending auth to your card with a couple small transactions, is there a chance your bank blocked them, which then might have triggered some weird domino effect? Did they email you a reason?
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:27:08
Yep! I've gotten a couple hundred dollars worth, you don't get it the instant they sign up or tell their account to transfer, you get it after that week long bank pull of funds.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:23:11
Last night took me 45mins. Not bad compared with Saturdays 12 hours....
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:38:11
Ahh, yeah sorry, same as coinbase 4 days. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:22:35
Like a few hundred more probably? The limit is time based, every hour you get a little more of your weekly limit back. So it doesn't take a full week to get the entire amount back.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:39:30
Fascinating that there are sooo many new posts about unconfirmed transactions recently. ;) 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:20:20
Coinbase is down again. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:44:07
Yeah... some btc atms are insane with fees, basically praying on new blood or atms that are being used for laundering.  Having said that, I don't know if yours was one of them. 
  When did you use the ATM? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:23:49
Not related to your question but you're sending it to a wallet that's compatible with the ICO's first right? Most ICOs aren't compatible if you send straight from gdax/coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:28:51
Did a couple transfers today takes about 7 hours each because of this nonsense.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:33:50
It's instant, when they are logged into coinbase, just go to gdax and click login. Done!  Takes another 2 seconds to deposit from your coinbase wallet.
@_date: 2018-11-06 12:37:08
This article comes off as crazy fake, and one of those “hurry up and read before the government shuts us down” click bait pages.
@_date: 2018-11-06 16:52:27
It's overall how it's written, endless paragraph breaks that are quotes. There's a lot of 'click bait' 'attention and create panic' type sentences and they just repeat the same information in each paragraph, and the final sentence.
“Crypto might be the last easy way to get rich in my generation.”

Look at the header and hover over the links, could just be phishing for random logins. And NO other exchanges do not blindly email you trying to get your business.
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:23:31
You sold 20k worth of BTC into FIAT? You might get one then. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 01:44:40
There’d have to be one hell of a system in place for fraud. Have to list a credit card as a backup I’d imagine.
@_date: 2018-03-01 11:57:56
And one has full government backing, and is seen as a worldwide stable standard.
@_date: 2018-03-01 12:01:37
I think there is something that’s been going on with stores closing and layoffs. I think it’s going to eventually time with that. It feels like a slow bleed that’s been going on in retail that might actually trigger something else.
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:42:01
Buyers also. As a seller, and maybe I'm the rarity, but 1/20 buying transactions easily is fraud.  They tend to stand out, similar to when you get a spam email, but people do ship to them and loose products and money.
@_date: 2018-02-14 06:23:00
Sorry but this was told to me directly from my banks executive customer support relations. And a number of other people in this thread were told the same thing. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:24:48
200 or 20k will meet the criteria for a 1099 to be generated. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:18:52
Both coinbase and chase have said that they changed the MCC code to process transactions as cash advances instead of normal transactions. Sorry read up on it.
@_date: 2018-02-25 16:01:32
Haha totally, I just expected the 'walmart' of crypto based on their fluff press release. ;) 
@_date: 2018-02-12 07:19:49
I think it just shifts who the middlemen are, who’s going to collect all the combustible material, who will take it away? 
@_date: 2018-02-12 07:34:12
Ah you’re right! Sorry first time I was on that page
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:24:22
So 1099's are half of the equation, they don't know what you did with the rest of the money or what your profits were, and so when you're filling out your taxes you can tell them what you did with the rest of the money so you're only charged on your profits.  Now if your 1099 is actually just plain wrong then you need to contact them to get it corrected since the IRS also has a copy of that 1099.
@_date: 2018-02-14 23:32:13
1. Goes to coinbase, 2. looks at buying bitcoin, 3. Sees that I can still buy bitcoin with unbanned credit cards, 4. Just for the heck of it I buy $5 on a CC, 5. Realizes that someone must have hurt in his past to make him so stupid.  
Maybe they just banned you? I have a CC that still works, sorry!
@_date: 2018-02-11 13:51:47
I’m sorry but that coin looks weak. Their idea just isn’t something that even needs blockchain tech.  Combustion chamber? What are we, going back to the steam powered engine here? Just burn shit to make electricity and create insane amounts of pollution? That will totally solve the problem. 
  
Why does this company even need to exist, just do what China and other countries are doing and build a private hydro powered dam in your backyard stream.   
@_date: 2018-03-03 19:16:04
The amount of line breaks in the above ^, has me suspect that this is an AD. And the shitty ness of the website. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:07:20
So far it looks globally.
01/29 - 01/30 was the switch so you might see it show up with a fee but def let us know, I’m going to make a list.

lol, sorry I just tend to approach everything with a bit of skepticism.

They stopped accepting new customers for I believe the last 8ish months. They just relaunched their product 
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:00:15
Ha see you really have no idea, the banks banned coinbase, it wasn’t coinbase that stopped accepting credit cards. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:31:13
All I’m doing is reporting directly what my bank told me, don’t be a dick dude, maybe my bank lied to me and the other people in this thread. It doesn’t matter anyway because 4 days later my bank banned coinbase.

So basically any database that you've ever put your email into might have a leak and that's how they got your email.  I'd say as long as you're using unique STRONG passwords + 2FA on every single different crypto exchange you're fine. But if you're not doing that, well.... yeah

20K is also the threshold on a number of other sites, paypal, amazon seller, etc...

Yeah, I love stocks. solid returns, a great company to back them up usually. I've made great returns in the market.

Ha, no, think of both seller hacked accounts and buyer hacked accounts. people sending bad gift cards, bad products, etc... You have multiple lines of protection when you use ebay, paypal, and a credit card.  Ebay Buyer Protection, Paypal buyer protection, and then if all that fails, a chargeback with your credit card.  There would have to be a system built into place to allow a chargeback for a bad seller or bad buyer.

Dude and sheep? I just dug through your post history. Ha 
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:46:56
Haha I went to check out that 'mining crypto store' in singapore, lol what a waste of time, lol they had nothing. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 04:54:31
Yeah, they do every year when banks fail, they publish their list 
@_date: 2018-04-29 04:59:05
The FDIC publishes all the banks that go under that they've helped each year, it happens more often than you realize.

I paid my taxes, my crypto friends paid theres. No point in trying to hide it.

So FYI, this is according to people filing with CreditKarma, which is a relatively new way of filing your taxes. They only started filing returns last year, so an argument could be made that people who trade in crypto just aren't using CreditKarma.
  
I think there's a STRONG argument to be made with this, since last year, their first year, CreditKarma didn't even support large amounts of tax forms that people need, so why even give them a shot this year. Which is why I didn't use them.  
  
So their reporting could be interpreted as, people who trade crypto just don't want to use them.

You mean Canada is C$100,000 or $77625.57 USD.
@_date: 2018-04-17 01:11:01
lol remember if it's 'free' you are the product.  Credit Karma is pretty upfront that they are selling and collecting your info anonymously.  Those tax forms are pretty valuable.

Yes... blockchain is the industrial use-case, companies building private blockchains, bitcoin is seen more and more as something that's seperate from the 'industrial use-case' 
@_date: 2018-04-29 04:58:24
There's a giant government that backs the fiat, incase you didn't know, they also have a giant military.
@_date: 2018-04-18 13:17:20
Ummm remember when it took 14-18+ hours to send a transaction, when was that? Oh yeah, last year.

Sadly the other way around is happening, Hong Kong becomes apart of China in 2047.
