Not any more then bitcoin, no.
@_date: 2014-12-11 15:45:17
haha no.
Apple is probably looking at creating their own nonconvertible virtual currency, if anything.
@_date: 2014-12-11 15:47:48
Well, there is the part with Microsoft never has to hold on to the bitcoin.
They'd take Beanie babies and tulips if they could immediately convert them to cash. I don't blame them.

If you think hoarding is a good way to run a currency, I got bad news for you.
@_date: 2014-03-30 12:38:44
Oh yes, have bitcoin, but it's not as popular here, naturally, was we know when we're getting fleeced.
@_date: 2014-12-19 15:22:55
yeah, seems so
@_date: 2014-03-30 12:11:53


Which is why it's retarded.
@_date: 2014-12-17 23:35:15


Lol how does gold and silver have intrinsic value?

The fact there isn't one should tell you who is the real police state.
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:25:43
I don't think the Natives need a new way to gamble.

Used for pay taxes in USA yes, but the vast majority of the currency is used outside of USA, where taxes are not paid in them, do not live in the fantasy that says its only value comes from the "coercion" boogieman.

And that's how they are useful as a currency, as people want to exchange them for assets.
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:29:45
...And you are not going to get that with a currency that constantly undergoes deflation, discouraging anyone from exchaning it as they could keep it for more value.
This is Austrian/Libertarian/AnCap economic's metaphorical Soviet Experiment, we have seen how the ideology plays out off the paper, how commerce would run on a constantly deflating decentralized currency, happily for the most part on the confines of the internet, so not much damage is done.
Electronic money is almost defiantly the future and while the Bitcoin experiment may not collapse now, the events of recent time is a harbinger of the future.
Next time let's consider a currency with a functional rate of inflation.

    Much 
                                Troll 
                                             wow! 
        So chaos.

It is a currency built towards being increasingly scarce, marginal inflation is required for stabilization and Bitcoin is not designed for that and the idea of BitCoin it's self is thought up against that very idea.
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:49:58
I mean the Idea are the result of Government force.
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:11:21
Wow, even you anti-government types are so america centric.
Outside of USA using the USD is purely for trade and not taxes, it's value is only based on it's utility as a currency.
