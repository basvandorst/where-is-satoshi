Except that he still has a lot more bitcoins to sell. My interpretation is that the Bitcoins must be sold otherwise MtGox may be forced to pay back people in Bitcoins and not in fiat, which they definitely don't want.

An individual can hide, but a corporation cannot. A company pays you salary, the government gets the company audited so they know your income. You invest in shares of a company, the company/exchange gets audited so they know your investment income.

1. Personally, I don't think so. Bitcoin price is increasing because people see it as a store of value. Once people start using Bitcoin as a payment, they are basically selling their bitcoin (people pay with bitcoin and the company instantly sells it for fiat). So price will probably drop.
2. It can't change the code of Bitcoin. An individual can easily hide but not a corporation. Governments can easily make any shop / exchange with a physical location to disclose anything they want and regulate it that way.
3. The most popular and established digital currency is currently the USD. It has nothing to do with currency going paperless. It's all about whether one digital currency (Bitcoin) can replace another digital currency (USD)

Yes. There is about 80 trillion dollars worth of "Money" in the world. This equates to 4 million dollars per bitcoin. If Bitcoin completely replaces all currency in all countries of the world, each bitcoin would be worth 4 million dollars in 2018 purchasing power.
