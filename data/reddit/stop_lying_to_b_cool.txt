You run your mouth too much.
Those two links speak for themselves.
I think you should delete your reddit account and focus on your job.

When I made my original post a few hours ago I did not stop to think about the emotional impact it might have had on you. I apologize for coming off rudely and I hope you have a great rest of your day. 
This issue is not trivial though. An analogy would be like saying "let's just build a great cellular phone - forget design as that is a trivial issue". Apple already put that argument to rest. Design, and the outward facing pieces matter at least as much as the internals.
Now as to who is sitting in and out of this conversation - it does not matter. The bitcoin devs should continue developing a strong piece of technology (the core), and not be focused on these kinds of issues. As long as the core runs on satoshis, any big player in the bitcoin space can switch to whatever weird naming they want (base pi I believe the joke was).
However, as we are a young community, naturally there are those who look towards bitcoin-qt for the lead in units and naming. Someone has to make the first move. 
Unfortunately, this is exactly the main weakness in open source software. 
I challenge you to think about a solution. I would try, but I am not very good at talking to and dealing with people. And this issue seems quite obvious, so dedicating any more time to it than I currently have would drive me a bit insane.
