Let me know when there are negative fees. I'll send a whole bunch of transactions back and forth between different wallets. :)

I'll take it

Diversify. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:54:22
Define normal.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:42:38
Everyone panicking think about this. We are either in one of 2 scenarios. 
1. The market is just doing normal pullback FUD and we will start trending up again in a few weeks.
2. The bubble already popped and we are in a bear market.  If this is true then history will remember that the bear market started a month ago.  If you have been hodling you have already hodled during a 50% crash. Even if it goes down 80% from the high and we are in a year long bear market, you have already held through half of it, why not keep hodling until you are in the green. It will go back up again as people are starting to use Cryptos.

What do you think happens when you pay less taxes?  The government has less money to offer things like social security, build roads, fund military, etc.  If you pay less taxes the government still needs to pay for these, but has less money to do it.  So they can either borrow it or print it which leads to inflation. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:57:14
Anytime an investment is 50% off it is a good entry point. Even if it takes a while to get back up there. Just don't risk more then you can lose and maybe diversify into different coins as well. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:02:28
Well let's do an experiment. Let your boss know that you will work for 50% off your normal salary. He will get a big savings. Let's see if your debt increases. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:46:52
Even if it doesn't pull back eventually. Crypto isn't going anywhere and worst case scenario we are already half way through a bear market. There is only so low it can go. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:50:09
I am up on 3 coins this month..... Got lucky, but still better than Tether. lol. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 03:38:25
So what if you paid no taxes whatsoever? Does that still mean that the government wouldn't have to borrow money to pay for expenses? Or does all the government money just come out of nowhere and the government never borrows a dime from anyone?
It still doesn't change the fact that the government spends money, if they have less revenue coming in, they have to get the money from somewhere. Saying they wouldn't is like saying you can stop going to work and will be able to still buy food without borrowing anything. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:02:42
It will help.  But I am still not sure why we don't also increase the block size of the coin?  Seems like doing both would make Bitcoin much cheaper. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 13:30:08
Bitcoin gaining 140K in a few hours.
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:04:58
Ok, so less people would be able to run nodes? How would that effect the coin? 
@_date: 2018-09-09 13:31:32
I honestly think Bitcoin is volatile because it is a small market. If we ever see Bitcoin at $1 million a $140K move will probably take a few months.
@_date: 2018-09-09 13:35:11
Well they quote his investing advice. It still holds true in Crypto.
@_date: 2018-09-09 13:34:07
Should you listen to someone who admits that they don't know much about cryptocurrencies? He's a stock man, but even he says stick to what you know. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 13:35:34
@_date: 2018-08-02 02:56:07
I'm just saying your previous points could easily apply to the stock market as well. Bad news comes out, stock market falls 2% in a day. The market is much larger so the moves are smaller, but they still happen. 
@_date: 2018-08-01 14:24:46
Well everything you said could also be applied to the stock market. Markets crash on bad news and go up on good news. And sometimes they do the opposite of what you think they will do.
But people look at the 100+ year stock market uptrend and use that to say it is a good long term hold. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 20:27:53
How many people actually bought at 19k?  We always want to talk about the worst possible case, but how often does that apply?
@_date: 2018-06-29 17:46:59
I'm calling the bottom at $5,642.98 on a Tuesday afternoon. You heard it here first folks.
@_date: 2018-06-29 17:50:49
I was looking through these forms, there was full panic mode happening when Bitcoin broke $6k last week. Fear and desperation have defiantly already hit a lot of holders.
@_date: 2018-06-24 15:35:45
Short term... Bear markets happen.  I mean what is the alternative? Sell it and put the money into the stock market and then panic when that has a bear market and drops 50%?
@_date: 2018-06-21 01:46:55
Tell me more about how buying at the exact top and selling near the exact low would lead to an investment loss.
@_date: 2018-06-24 15:41:07
Btc has dropped massively yet adoption and good news keeps moving forward. Eventually we will bottom out.
@_date: 2018-06-24 15:37:29
No, but when all news seems to be good yet we keep moving lower, it kind of seems like the markets are just overreacting. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 15:44:44
Read the definition of pyramid scheme. 
Are getting cash flow from early investors? No. 
Will the system disappear if no new investors get in? No. 
Are there any guaranteed returns? No.
Is someone managing this and running away with the money? No.
Has there been any government investigation for pyramid scheme? No.
@_date: 2018-06-24 15:25:38
No, but it does mean that it will be unprofitable for miners to make BTC. So in theory we shouldn't see more supply. But as demand continues to grow at some point it should reverse.  
@_date: 2018-03-18 23:48:50
Not sure what the number would be. But other major currencies have tens of trillions to hundreds of trillions in current supply (digital not physical).  
If Bitcoin is going to realistically be another payment option along side the U.S. dollar, Euro, etc. The market cap would need to be in the many tens of trillions as well.
20 trillion would be a $1 million coin, but that is a wild ass guess that sounds cool.  
What isn't a guess is that if it is actually a common payment option it would require a much higher market cap then it has today. I would even argue that the reason it is so volatile is because the market cap is so small.
If it ever become mass adopted and gets a good market cap it won't have as much liquidity and likely won't have the big swings. Think about Gold and Silver. They hardly move at all because there is just so much liquidity. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 17:24:03
It's PROBABLY a great time to invest if you don't need the money and can hold onto it for a few years. It is cheap. But that is no guarantee. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:55:02
How long ago was this?
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:46:33
Agreed. But when we have already fallen so much there is no point in doing something other than HODLing. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:36:06
Bitcoin crashed 90% before and bounced back. Even the stock market crashed 90% during the great depression and bounced back.

I believe Buffet's 2 rules are
1. Don't lose money
2. Don't forget rule number 1
I don't remember anything about cutting losses. Buffet is like the best Hodler of the stock market that way. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:39:34
I would not really listen to CNBC for investment advice. I know people that have used CNBC and other new outlets for their decisions and they can't stop losing money investing. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:53:21
Ouch. I'm not down that much. But I am down. But I doubt blockchain will just die. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:55:31
Well if the path doesn't change I don't see it happening. The deficit increases every year and the new tax plan is supposed to add to it. Much of the U.S. economy growth and population growth comes from immigrations of talent from other countries. But we seem to want to attack that now too. I am hoping for the best. But preparing for the worst.

Focus on the tech. If the tech is good it will be adopted. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:34:10
The experienced say to hold while the inexperienced are panic selling. Wonder which one I should believe. :)
@_date: 2018-02-10 16:30:30
The best part about the market rising is that we get to reuse the memes that we just reused in the bear market from prior reuses in the prior bull market. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:05:33
The U.S. will have to eventually default on some of it's treasuries. I don't see any other way it can work out. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:36:36
It's not so easy to do because you never know where the bottom is. But if you buy after a 50+% crash the odds of it dropping another 50% are much lower then if you buy during an ATH. Anything is possible, but you are getting more coins for less. I'm sure people who bought near $10k will be pretty happy with that decision in 2 years. You just have to have a longer term perspective. You won't be a millionaire overnight.
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:38:53
Sounds like we think alike :)
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:44:55
Sounds like a good time to buy :)
@_date: 2018-02-13 02:39:47
I agree. As it stands now I would never shop at an all bitcoin store because if someone tells me I can buy a hat for .00325 Bitcoin I wouldn't know if I was getting a great deal or being ripped off.
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:29:13
Our new budget is like a $1 trillion deficit.  That mean every 20 years we will add $20 trillion to the debt.  And.... That pace is increasing.  
Japan has also had many many years of stagnation, low growth, and poor stock market gains. Maybe we don't want to go there. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:08:22
In all seriousness. Stocks are probably due for at least a 50% crash.  I'd probably buy some if it dips that low.  But meanwhile we are already at a 50% sale on cryptos. What a wonderful time to be alive. :)
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:26:50
True, but at the same time, when it was around $3k the first time it pulled back to $1,900 before going back up. So at one time that was buying at the top too. lol
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:59:46
Well to be fair at one time people who bought in &lt;$50 were telling people who bought in &gt;$500 to hodl. At the time people who bought in &gt;$500 thought their investment would go to zero. Blockchain is here to stay whether you panic sell it or not. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:34:50
It's a cycle and happens in all markets. Things crash, then smart investors start buying, followed by early investors who drive the market up, and finally the masses who drive new highs and a new bull market, then in a few years we crash again. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:44:47
Same thing happens with any other investment when it is a bears market. You make money by looking at what the masses are doing, and doing the opposite.
@_date: 2018-02-03 18:01:18
I could sure use a 70% surge right about now. lol
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:48:45
Oh yeah good point. I am down a lot from my ATH. But up like maybe 10X from my original investment.
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:42:29
If it is then we should learn from experience and take the next year to buy as much as we can. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:48:52
For now being the key word. Time to make sure all of your investments are long term projects you believe in, sit back, and focus on other areas of your life.
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:31:53
If Bitcoin ever becomes adopted by the masses then the price will be a whole lot more stable than today. It's just that it would be stable at $1 million BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:56:10
The stock market is in a massive bubble right now. Sure it's backed by actual companies. But.... would you pay $400,000 to buy a company that nets $10k/year in real life? Probably not. 
Most assets have some value. The trick is knowing whether it is worth more or less then what it is currently selling for. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:47:07
Litecoin was at $90, it went down to $77, so I bought the dip. Then it dipped to $50.  Long story short it is still well above $100 now. So.... Hodl if you believe in the tech. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:03:53
2% is for sissies! It takes a real man to hodl a 60% loss.
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:28:32
This man will be rich one day.
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:59:14
We really don't know. We have already pulled back 50%. That is like the average "crash." so we could be at the bottom or we could have a little longer to go.  The 3 things we do know are likely to happen are;
1. When we hit the bottom, we won't know it was the bottom until after the fact.
2. Most people will still be calling doom and gloom when we are at the bottom.
3. We are likely at a discounted price right now and as long as it stays around any buyer will probably be up in a year or 2 from this price.
That's good enough for me not to sell.  
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:35:38
If we only knew where the bottom was.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:59:09
Gold and silver never do well. Not sure why everyone is surprised about this.
@_date: 2018-02-04 01:19:21
I understand. But investing is hard work... emotionally sometimes. I started buying in July and everything tanked. ETH went from like $400 to $188. But you just have to research what you are buying and have enough confidence to hold onto it.
I think that is why it is also important to not invest more than you can afford to lose. It's easier to hold on when you don't have your life savings on the line.
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:25:24
2-3k is pretty unlikely. After such a massive crash odds are we won't see another massive crash right after it. You never know, but in general that's not hold investment markets work. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 00:44:58
Sounds like they just haven't been in the market long enough. I mean what is 2 months really. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 00:54:27
5 years ago the price of Gold was higher then it is now. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 03:19:15
Nope, I bought stocks in 2009 after a 50% crash. At the time everyone I knew was saying we were never going to recover from the stock market recession for many many years. That was my first investment. Made good money on that. 
I've been doing my research and buying the dips in different markets when I have the money. So, far it has worked out pretty well... "knock on wood."
The trick is to buy things that have value when they are on sale. Like now. lol :) 
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:58:21
I wouldn't say that. Stocks move, it just takes more time then crypto.  In 2008 the S&amp;P 500 lost 50% of it's value. I bought in 2009 and tripled my money in a few years. 
Been buying dips ever since. :)
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:18:10
If I had money I wasn't afraid to risk it would be. If I wasn't already into Bitcoin, I would consider this to be a second chance to buy and hold for a year.
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:48:59
Buying on the dip means higher reward for lower risk. Buying at ATHs mean higher risk and lower rewards.
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:23:30
17k wasn't really a dip. ATH was like 19k, so it was pretty close to that. I'd say a dip doesn't really start until after 30%-50% loss. An extreme dip might be 80%, but 30-50% seem to be the most common.  
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:30:12
It's $150 now. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:04:23
Ok, well nothing fundamental has really changed. The only thing new with Bitcoin is that the lightning network is kicking in, which is a good thing. 
Seems the market crash is just irrational and will reverse at some point. 
@_date: 2018-07-21 02:57:50
I think we only have large fluctuations because of the small market. If we ever get to a $250k BTC a large drop would probably be a drop to $240k.
@_date: 2018-04-15 14:36:27
I've been around. Watched the 2008 crash, went back and saw all the crashes in the stock market and all the crashes in the crypto market.... this is just everyday normal behavior.
