Upvote. Interesting read!
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:12:07
May I ask why are you insinuating that the prices will actually be higher?
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:29:16
idk, maybe the one from 19700 to 18200 that happened in like 45 mins?
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:27:06
exactly thats why I am worried. "13k 8 days ago"
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:44:31
hahaha you're judging a book by its cover. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:44:25
This is an asset that lost 80% of its value 5 different times. How can it be a 'store of value'? Store of value means no matter when I need to cash out I will have the same amount.

You haven't answered the question. A question usually ends with an interrogation mark. Good luck with your 2 bitcoins. You're the MVP, I'll be the dumbass, fine. :) 
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:28:26
Yes but how many bitcoin are those people removing from supply? 0.1 average? The times when normal people could buy 10-20 bitcoin are over. The demand increase will be much lower.

I sold everything. I am not just holding BCH or BTC. Diversified for any case scenario
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:44:52
sell man your going to go broke
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:10:14
If you had 10k btc you would already know. But if you have 10 and want to cash out just use Gemini or Quadriga to cash out.

6% in 1hr LMAO YES

By the way, please dont compare BTC to gold. Gold is the most useful type of metal as it is used for jewelry, electronics, computers, financial, dentistry, medical, aerospace industry, and so many more. Now who's stupid ?
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:19:47
stupid troll
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:50:57
lol it will dip don't worry. Charts don't look good since a while. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:52:38
Source? Exchange? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:58:39
wtf is this
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:21:40
I don't understand why people always include their bitcoin address at the end of posts. If you have been here for five years then why do you care to ask for some mere 20 or 40 bucks
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:47:42
Thanks for asserting my intellectual capacities. Gold is used as a store of value but does not loose 80% of its value every year or so. There is way less volatility. Yet you call me stupid but you didn't answer my question. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:05:52
It's hard for it to happen as many whales are out of the market for now. Bitcoin needs them for a push and they won't be pushing anything if we do not consolidate at previous supports, which we haven't. Once consolidation happens, you can expect a 14k bitcoin with maybe even a push at 20k
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:26:51
what's wrong with selling? As long as I know there are two choice options :buy or sell. Only bad investors close their eyes and decide not to expand their knowledge. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:14:15
This is pretty reckless because if the people don't succeed they will be losing their money 
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:10:27
RSI indicators are over 83. Usually every single time we were over 80 there was a significant correction. This reminds me of the time a chineese exchange announced the trading of ether which speculated an increase in demand. Didn''t happen. 
IMO bitcoin does not have enough fuel to go much higher. Once people realise CME does not involve bitcoin demand increase in the short term, we will correct. Don't always listen to the moon kids for the short-midterm. PM for more info I've seen scenarios like this for 4 years

This is exactly what I'm talking about. How much does blockstream pay you to reply within few minutes to bitcoin cash comments?
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:01:53
Yes. You can find early posts of Satoshi on BitcoinTalk forum communicating with his partners on the initial versions of Bitcoin. You will find no post about him degrading another individual, or even employing this kind of language. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:32:32
Bitcoin Cash is the solution. The team has tested 340GB blocks. Go read the news everybody and get informed on the reality. Blockstream is brainwashing you

Very interesting post and I believe so too. The speed of which the market is evolving now, the 100K should hit in 2 years tops. But be careful, don't forget that cryptos market is a market like any other market in this world, thus market rules apply to  the crypto market as well. Im fairly certain Bitcoin and other main cryptos like Ethereum should keep on spiking until the end of the year but for 2018 things remain uncertain. There WILL be market crashes like any other established market in this world. We WILL see Bitcoin and all other cryptos go through market cycles throughout the following years. If not, then Bitcoin would be worth 100K in less than 2 years :) Just saying, be aware and don't fall in the dream that this current cycle will last for 10 years. 
Don't get me wrong though, I do believe in the blockchain technology and cryptos more than anything else in this world right now, so I truly believe that we will hit 100K per Bitcoin or if it has to be another crypto, it will for sure happen in the future.

Seriously its not that bad at all. You just have to meet with a few people from the finance world to guide you well ( I mean people who you will pay for all this BS) and you can save up A TON instead of paying the highest possible that your government will try to get from you. I dont know how it works in the US but basically in Canada if you find a way to manipulate your income and move into company revenue (your own company) you will pay up to 10x less than a normal bitcoin "investor". DONT PANIC and talk to educated people who have experience with this in the past.

USD looks like it jumped off a bridge and sank to the bottom of the ocean 
Edit: 
Here's what the deep sea looks like and I think there's a lot more to explore deep down
