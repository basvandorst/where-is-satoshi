I still do not understand how the lightning network fixes the transaction limit of bitcoin. You still need a transaction on the blockchain to load up your channel and you need one to close it.
So while you can offload a lot of transactions, there's still way too many left. 
I've heard people say you can just use your exchange for that, they will basically do the transactions for you, at which point I'm like "That sounds like paypal/banking". I don't get it. What am I missing?

OKay, I will need to research what exactly a routing node is because that term is nebulous to me.

Because for humans to sustain life some basic requirements need to be met. Air, water, and food will always have value because we can not survive without them.
Next requirement is warmth and shelter, we can not survive if it's too cold. You basically follow that ladder up, one thing building upon the last.
Unless you are willing to say that your survival has no worth, you will have to admit that objects that enable your survival have worth as well.
@_date: 2019-02-06 13:58:12
But the business needs to withdraw the money at some point, don't they? So they will want to close the channel at some point.
@_date: 2019-02-05 12:07:25
Terms only have meaning in context/reference to something. I think you are making the mistake of excluding the context of 'human' when it comes to the term value.
You can not separate the concept of value from how a human would perceive it because then the term becomes meaningless. And like I said unless you don't value your own life at all, or the lives of the people around you, food will always have value to you.
Thinking about the term "value" and "inherent value" in a vacuum, with nobody around that needs or wants anything makes no sense. That's like arguing about what a round corner would look like. It's gibberish.
@_date: 2019-02-05 09:29:44
The idea that nothing has inherent value, or that some things don't have more inherent value than others needs to die. It's complete nonsense same as the 'all value is relative! things are worth what somebody will pay for them!'. These concepts have merit but if applied by people with little to no actual knowledge they lead to blindly stupid conclusions.
@_date: 2019-02-05 12:40:49
I would say yes, inherent value comes from how necessary/useful something is.
Something having inherent value doesn't determine the real value though. If you live near a clean source of water but no food, food is more valuable to you than water, but you still most definitely need water.
If you live in an environment that doesn't naturally produce oxygen, it becomes incredibly valuable to you.
Oxygen can never lose all value, unlike something like bitcoin. Nike, just the icon/brand is worth a lot of money, yet nobody is gonna buy air from you. But Nike has the potential to be worth nothing, oxygen will always be worth something. That's inherent value.
@_date: 2019-02-05 10:57:34
You are not willing to accept the claim "Humans want to live, if a human doesn't want to live anymore there's something wrong.' ?
If you are that much of a relativist, yeah to you nothing is worth anything and everything is meaningless.
To me and the vast majority of people that is nonsense. So it's not a surprise that we can't find common ground.
@_date: 2019-02-05 10:47:33


No, because only an insane or sick (as in mental illness, or otherwise damaged) person would consider their own life worthless and thus not worth the effort to sustain.
Also, if you break things down too much, everything becomes meaningless. It's not useful to do that, hence why we have mathematical equations that aren't correct in all cases, but in a lot of cases and thus they are very useful.
@_date: 2019-02-06 12:29:48
What's wrong with that is, in my opinion, that you either need a separate lightning channel with every business you do transactions with. Allocating a months worth of coffee funds for your coffee shop. Or you need to use other peoples 'nodes'(?) or lightning channels(?). But they aren't gonna let you do that for free, so you lose money on transactions fees again.
Or, you could have your checkings account with your exchange, the exchange has its own channels with a lot of businesses and just shuffles money around internally at which point I'm like "Okay, my exchange is my new bank" what is even the point of that.
Maybe I don't get it but I have not found a video or something that would explain it to me properly.
@_date: 2019-01-07 09:34:44
Yeah but a business or individual that wants to actually cash out, turning Bitcoin into fiat. How does that work? They need to actualize the transaction and to do that the channel needs to be closed.
€: Unless exchanges are willing to give cash purely because they receive funds through the LN, at which point I have to wonder...why even blockchain lol.
@_date: 2019-01-31 08:42:03
So? Using physical currency has nothing to do with online transactions. Physical currency is a feature of fiat that bitcoin lacks. You are basically saying bitcoin uses less energy than banks because banks do a lot more stuff. Well duh. Maybe compare A to A.
@_date: 2019-01-25 08:17:00
*And other fantasies we tell ourselves to distract us from a clear downwards trend.
@_date: 2019-01-31 08:38:35
To your A: It is entirely about a simple validation for a transaction (or batch of transactions). All the extra processes built around it are solutions to problems created by bitcoin itself, they exist because of the way it works. These extra tasks of in order to maintain a public ledger would have no purpose without the transactions and are thus part of it. It makes no sense to talk about transactions within the bitcoin system without automatically including all the stuff stacked on top of it.
B: Now you are starting to lose me completely because banks do a whole lot more than just validating transactions buddy. Of course, all the extra services consume energy. Can you go to your bitcoin ledger and request a loan?
The fact that bitcoin consumers a hell of a lot more power for transactions than banks do cannot be disputed by any sensible person. Instead, people should argue WHY that energy consumption is justified. At least that position is not lost by default.
@_date: 2019-01-23 10:18:54
lol, can you imagine people using bitcoin in 147 years? I can not.
@_date: 2019-01-31 09:24:38
The need for physical currency doesn't just go away. Why would that need just disappear? How does Bitcoin solve that need better than other approaches? Bitcoin offers certain things, but not a better solution for the instant electronic transfer of money. That can be done with other things as well, and yet those things haven't displaced physical currency.
@_date: 2019-01-23 13:01:41
I doubt we'll be using USD in 147 years.
@_date: 2019-01-31 07:41:12
I mean, that is all well and good but the statement "Bitcoin uses an extraordinary amount of electricity to do a very simple thing." is factual. To validate transaction on the blockchain complex calculations have to be undertaken, and the more miners there are competing to complete a block the more difficult this calculation becomes.
Also,  the assertion that just because this electricity comes from a 'green source' means it is carbon neutral is just silly. Do you think it takes 0 energy to build solar panels? Ship them? Install them? Maintain them? Same with all green sources of energy. 
So in conclusion, the article lays out very clearly why some of the reports about bitcoins power consumption are complete horseshit, but that doesn't mean bitcoin is not using a huge amount of electricity to accomplish a simple thing, validating transactions.

o_Ô The planet? 
@_date: 2019-01-22 08:15:57
Oh please. The ones living in their own dreamworld are the people that honestly think people buy more goods and services with bitcoin than PayPal. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 07:50:15
Doesn't show that at all. If I transfer 1 million in 1 transactions, that's (according to this article) 1 million in volume. That doesn't tell you anything about the capacity for transactions. Most consumer transactions are small. From 3-20 dollars.
@_date: 2019-01-07 09:21:34
LN transactions have to be sent to the blockchain eventually don't they? You don't actualize your transaction otherwise and just moving theoretical bitcoins from left to right.
@_date: 2019-01-31 07:57:36
I'm not sure what you are getting at? Are you asserting that energy consumption for bank transactions is the same as it is for bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-01-22 07:47:56
That can't be real. There is absolutely no way people are buying more stuff with bitcoin than with PayPal.
That's not even to shit on BitCoin or anything, but PayPal *must* have more users.
@_date: 2019-01-30 15:19:29
Because, what is the alternative? 
@_date: 2019-01-07 07:50:58
But money only actually gets deposited once the transaction is added to the blockchain right? So who does that if my transaction hops over many LN? Me when I close it?
@_date: 2018-12-27 08:07:54
Who says I haven't made bank all of 2018 doing just that?
Na I haven't, because I don't gamble. Bitcoin goes up for no reason sometimes, then it goes down again when people realize "Oh wait, there's nothing I can do with this that I can't do with something else a lot easier."
The few random super niche cases where bitcoin IS useful are not enough to sustain a price increase.
@_date: 2018-12-31 08:05:05
How can a channel that I open between myself and my exchange have access to LN between other people?
@_date: 2018-12-28 11:49:57


Yes, that's a good thing. Spending is how GDP grows, how the government collects taxes, how businesses make sales.
@_date: 2018-12-24 10:35:22
Or it could keep falling as more and more people give up on it seeing as there is still no real market for bitcoin besides buying drugs and other illegal goods.
@_date: 2018-12-28 14:42:26


People already do that. I do that. I have a 1080TI, I didn't buy the 2080TI because it's not enough of an upgrade. 
But that effect would persist and double up with a currency that gains value. Good technology getting cheaper because better technology is released would double up with my purchasing power increasing simply by sitting on that money.


You don't know if that is going to be the case. You don't know if it's going to be 2%, 1%, 10%, 25%. We have nothing to base our speculations on but more speculations.


Because not everyone is born into a rich family? What does it mean? It means closing the generational wealth gap. Reducing inequality. 
"Having lots of bitcoin early means nothing in the long run". Okay I mean that's just so fucking wrong I can't even. Having a a lot of a resource that steadily increases in value? Real currencies currently decrease in value, still by having a lot of it and investing it you can simply live off of the money your money earns. Now imagine your money doesn't just earn extra money by investing, but by simply excising. 
Again the advantage compounds.


That's "class warfare, the rich vs the poor" which wouldn't change much if we switched over to bitcoin.
Bitcoin would not solve shady government problems. If a government wants to fuck you, specifically you they can. Tomorrow the EU could decree laws regulating, outlawing, doing what ever with bitcoin and none of it's decentralized nature would save it.

So I've read all of it (well, some parts I flew over) but I didn't see a solution for the fact that you'd have to load up your lightning wallet with funds before doing your first of presumably many purchases smaller than the initial load up.
@_date: 2018-12-28 11:46:02
You know what sub you are in right? Bitcoin is one big gamble.
@_date: 2018-12-28 15:24:53


That just shows that you do not comprehend what relative spending power is and now I'm not surprised anymore that you can't grasp the concept of inflation being good for the economy.
I have 100 coins and they are worth 100 chicken eggs
The next week, I have 99 coins worth 100 chicken eggs because my coins increased in value but chicken eggs didn't.
Next week I have 98.1 coins worth 100 chicken eggs.
Next week I have 95.9995 coins worth 100 chicken eggs.
Is my fortune decreasing in real terms? 
Saving for the sake of saving is bad for the economy. We can argue about how much people save now vs. if a currency would gain value over time but unless you are willing to say that spending behavior would not change at all, it would be bad for the economy.
@_date: 2018-12-28 12:07:18


How is that not an incredibly bad thing for the economy? If people only bought what they really needed, who would buy a new generation of TVs? Phones? Chairs? Who would renovate their Kitchen if the old one was still serviceable.
People would lose their jobs left and right because demand would drop through the floor. Thousands of viable businesses generating income for the people producing and designing their products would die.
It would end in a massive recession. How exactly do you earn your money? Because if it's not farming or an industry related to producing food you are out of work.
@_date: 2018-12-28 11:46:59
So, you want a currency that gains value? Or that is perfectly stable, rigid and never changes no matter the benefit?
@_date: 2018-12-28 13:15:57


Note that I never said never. Saying "nobody would ever buy a phone again!" would be stupid, one I didn't make. Apparently you need me to make such stupid statements or your argument can't hold water.
However, if my money increase din purchasing power by an unknowable value every year, every month, maybe every week I'd be a fucking fool to buy anything unless I really really need that thing. This month I'm able to buy the 1350 version, but just a month later thanks to a spike in the currency, now I can buy a 1450!
I would hold on to my money as much as I can even if the increase was slower, because every time I spend money I lose out on the automatic income it would generate for me.
Money that increases in value instead of decreasing also means it would be that much harder for somebody with nothing to catch up with somebody who already has a lot. It would be like swimming upstream because every extra bitcoin you try to earn is harder than the last.
We've also never used a currency which we could not increase the supply of, who the fuck knows what unforeseen consequences that could have.
I'm not a conservative person, but unless you can bring arguments to the table that beat mine and aren't nonsense like "The banks want to make us poor to finance global wars with their printed money!" conspiracy crap I'm out.
Governments don't do things against the will of their citizens in a democracy, every politician elected into an office of power is there as a consequence of elections, past and present.

So I buy my Bitcoin with real money from an exchange, and keep that money at the exchanges lightning network so I can quickly without needing to access the block chain resolve my payments.
I mean, that sounds an awful lot like my exchange just became my bitcoin bank. Hopefully there will be laws and regulations in place.
