My local BK has had a little trouble with them in the past.  Their Point of Sale(POS) system is old fashioned and isn't setup to scan the barcodes.  I had to get them to manually enter it as well and once that was taken care of it goes thru just fine.  What I've found though is that the BK gift card system is absolute crap and is down almost as often as it is working.  I've gotten into the habit of calling ahead if I plan on using them.
On a related note, Target works perfectly every time, scans no problem.  CVS works but most times it either takes a few tries to scan it or the cashier doesn't enter it as a gift card and has to redo it.
Papa John's website is just fine for gift cards but will not accept more than one per order.  Further, if you enter a second payment method of cash you cannot have them change it in store, so no way of using a second gift card in person.  Lastly, neither the local store or the corporate gift card hotline can combine cards so if you use say $8 of a $10 card, you can't add that to another card.
Sorry for the wall of text but I hope this helps a few folks.
Edit: Almost forgot, I checked with Gyft and because of how they purchase gift cards, you can't have them add value to an existing card either.
