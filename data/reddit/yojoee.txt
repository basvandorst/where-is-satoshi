You’re asking the bitcoin subreddit if they think bitcoin is better than stocks.....what do you think the answer will be???

The House doesn’t have the slightest clue about what this project is. All they know is they hate Facebook and will go against anything Facebook try’s to do.

What is considered “low” “fast” “reliable”.... literally every metric they displayed is based on opinion.

My favorite is how they consider BCH a digital currency but BTC is not.....like wtf? ....I think they just needed one more metric to fill the table and threw that in there LOL

Nah, just buy it all so no can get any. Then there’s no use for it. Buyout all the miners too. If someone with a lotta power was actually afraid of bitcoin, that’s what they’d do.

Only degenerates with shitty credit buying crypto on Credit Cards....can’t blame them..

I had to do the same training as OP. Bank of America does not give a shit about crypto. Typically any customers asking about crypto are poor millennial looking to take extreme risk. It is not something Merrill Lynch or BoA work with. We do however recognize that this space is not going away. So it’s important that Advisors know how to react when asked about crypto currency.

Bitcoins not threatening anyone. If it was, they’d just buy it all.

It shouldn’t need to use any energy to run. PoW is wasteful and will change with time.
