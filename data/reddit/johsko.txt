Direct youtube link, since that page is cancer and infinitely reloads itself with an ad blocker on. And there's also nothing on it besides the youtube video. Probably someone trying to double-dip on ad revenue.

I sold at 17k to make back my original investment plus a bit more, so no matter what happens I've already made a profit. Hodling the rest with no worries.

Still waiting on a ticket from half a year ago. I don't actually need it anymore since the problem resolved itself after a month or two, but I haven't closed it so I can see their response time for when I *do* need it.
Long story short, I'm not using coinbase anymore.

Honestly, I chose not to pay off my student loan. The interest is lower than the rate of inflation, so my loan pays off itself while I'm making minimum payments.
I'd instead say be smart about it and don't buy more than you're willing to lose, but no reason to avoid it altogether.

*In the US.* Before I moved here, I had no idea why credit card fraud was such a massive problem here, cause I don't know anyone who's had it happen in Sweden (that's not to say it *doesn't* happen, but it's not common).
With my Swedish card, whenever I try to buy something online using my credit card number, I get forwarded to my bank's web page and have to authenticate with my bank. One of the options for doing so is to use a device I received by the bank that I put my card into, enter my PIN, enter the code shown on the bank's page, and get a code back to input on the bank's page. The chip is *actually* used to verify my online purchase.
And this is the *old* way of authenticating, that has been in use for 10-ish years. The new one is to use your electronic ID to sign off on the purchase. Apparently this whole system is called [3-D Secure]( I don't know of any Swedish online store that *doesn't* use it, and my bank allows me to block all purchases from other countries (or I have the option of blocking all internet purchases entirely).
That said, obviously using something like bitcoin is more secure, but my point is the system doesn't *have* to be as broken as the US one.

I contacted them a month and a half ago, and yesterday got this (for the second time):
