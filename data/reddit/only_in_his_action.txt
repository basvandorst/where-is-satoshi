Even if you did come across bitcoin back then, truth is you probably would not have bought any. Don't beat yourself up.

Regardless of what people say. You cannot predict the future. You did good.

You can regulate all you want, greedy human beings are goin to find new ways to scam their fellow man and crash the world economy for their own slice of the pie (or did this teacher forget about the sub prime loans CDO disaster? It wasn't THAT long ago). We need a trustless system; we need the blockchain.

you realise gold has real life application, and cannnot be manufactured. Not saying that bitcoin is a hoax, but the two thing are extremely different.

You new guys are ridicolous. All I said is that gold is very different from bitcoin, bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and every limitation about it is arbitrary. You could very easily make a new cryptocurrency with a higher cap. New gold cannot be realistically synthesized, but new cryptocurrencies are born every other day. When I said gold has real life applications I meant physical, tangible stuff. Let me be clearer; things are built with it and not just jewellery, there is gold inside the phone you are using right now; and no other material other than gold can be used; where you could use litecoin instead of bitcoin and nothing would change. Again I'm not trying to bash bitcoin; bitcoin is great but stop trying to make it into something that is not.
