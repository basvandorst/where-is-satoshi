This at least supports the fact I was hacked - I feel so helpless and stupid for letting these scam artists get over on me. I transferred all my $ out of Coinbase (which was probably infinitely more secure that my blockchain wallet)

I'm sorry I am new to this and didn't know it would create such an inconvenience for you - thanks for your post.

I have an up to date OS on Mac - I always keep it updated. 
What should I do ?

I have asked Blockchain Support for their help but they aren't responding to any requests - the owner of AMIGI METALS who first introduced me to Bitcoin told me to reach out to the community - does the link below help ? 
What else can I provide ?

So my computer is compromised - got it. 
And... I will never see the 10.5 bitcoins again unless this guy - 
1P1irgfLvsAjr2fpNDsAeoKBu1n1aDMYWy voluntarily returns the $ he/she stole ?

I transferred .5 bitcoin from Coinbase to Blockchain and they just robbed me like that ?
How can their security be so poor ?
@_date: 2014-06-30 17:09:33
I have informed Blockchain - 
How do I watch the coins and what should I do with the user - request them back ?

I have the same password for my Facebook account - 
@_date: 2014-06-30 16:43:25
Regrettably - the password was obviously not complicated enough, is there any additional information I can provide that will help recover these losses ?

Encrypted-Wallets.com ?
@_date: 2014-06-30 17:27:28
Blockchain just responded - said they can't help

That is the person who hacked my account ?
