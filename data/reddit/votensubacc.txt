Wouldn't you boycott Bitstamp also? They have BCH support.

Hahaha what? 2^8 ?


Bandwidth and hd space. How's your face feel?

I'm guessing English might not be your first language? It's just I'm not able to make sense of what you're writing, so I don't understand or know what to say. And are you calling me or a shill? In either case it's pretty obvious you haven't read r/btc then lol.
@_date: 2017-07-04 19:16:59
And then what happened? What's your version of the story?
@_date: 2017-07-02 00:09:38
Ehh, no
Edit: I was downvoted for this, what the fuck.

Here's a thread that discusses that assertion, and it looks like a non-issue to me: 
@_date: 2017-07-09 07:18:30
I see it as a nuanced issue outside of only just that. May I refer you to this video? 
It explains things better than I could. But I'll give a short retort, let me refer to what you said here:


Which is true and I agree. But the thing is that a main factor to when the correlation decreases is the act of using a decrease in value of money as a tool to increase production (economic growth).
@_date: 2017-07-09 01:07:44


I beg to differ. Also it's not the entirety of what I meant, I meant it as a response to "what matters is economic growth". And I didn't originally claim anything actually, I'm not the same person. I'm not sure how you see what I said as a restatement of what he claimed?

Hey I recommend this video for finding details on the subject to research, it's fairly good and educational, it breaks things down very well: 
@_date: 2017-07-09 02:02:51
Seriously that's your retort? Bet you've never even given r/btc a read btw.
@_date: 2017-07-09 06:26:49
Your comment makes no sense. What do you mean?
And it's a stupid reply btw.
@_date: 2017-07-08 22:01:28
What matters is the change of value of the currency over time.

/Facepalm. You're not going to have a significantly higher technological requirement for 2mb blocks, or even 8mb blocks...
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:34:07


I'd be surprised. But it doesn't mean it isn't wrong.
Let's just observe new information and how things play out, and see which side of the coin things turn out to be :)
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:10:23


So you think r/btc is wrong?
@_date: 2017-07-09 22:22:20
Who's comments? I'm actually not sure if you're apologizing for your sentences or not. And I don't understand the rest of your comment. Whoever you're speaking of has said the entire sub lacks critical thinking skills, but I'm on you about your retort? I guess I need context to understand what you mean by that? In any case I can say that your reply wasn't a retort at all (no critical thinking skills or counter-argument for discussion) and I was implying that in the beginning. And I never called you a shill if that's what you're saying, but it seems you're implying either me or are. I wouldn't think you are, unless you've chosen the strategy to not make any sense, which doesn't make sense lol.
Edit: And can you also give me a rewind and please explain to me what this means?


@_date: 2017-06-26 07:06:41
HAHAHA you moved the goalposts so hard there the goalposts have ended up on the other side of the field!! Suddenly your view is that you expect nothing less than conspiracy theory from someone active on like "bah, you're just a conspiracy theorist like the rest of your kind". After writing up a piece on r/btc'ers being sock puppets that are lying to create a narrative. So which is it? Are we conspiracy theorists or are we sock puppets? Lol. No need to answer, make it a surprise with your next false narrative.

Well, he definitely says that as an appeal to emotion. But he's come to admit that bitcoin is sound money since then.


Not by much though when you look at the full picture from what I see. It appears an incredibly inefficient system for current benefit.


Doesn't exactly instill confidence for me. Unless there's something I'm missing it sounds like a recipe for cascading bank runs. Isn't this what we've seen happen in several countries already?


Yeah I'm not so sure about this either. I don't go so far as feeling that taxation always means theft. But:


I think in this case he's right, it appears they only benefit marginally so saying that he's wrong doesn't take into account what they could have instead. The working class definitely appear to be drawing the short stick, and just because it's a stick doesn't necessarily mean it's all good and fair. I guess what I'm saying is the same as what you're saying, "do bankers benefit *more* than the working class"? Though my answer is leaning pretty hard toward yes, I'll continue bearing that question in mind too. And I'll link you to info if I come across it if you like, I'll keep it in the back of my mind. Have you seen the movie 'The Big Short' though? I felt the movie portrayed pretty well what kind of systematic scams and nefarious people can potentially be found in the financial system.

I'm sorry, but have you been to r/btc?
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:09:56
How can r/btc be wrong on the subject related? r/btc would have to be wrong on so many levels... Explain to me please? Including what damage Jihan and Roger have done to bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:57:20


Yes it seems you cannot ;)
