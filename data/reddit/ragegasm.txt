I don't know why you're getting down voted.  Those are all incredibly valid concerns.

I don't know if it's possible right now to reverse engineer a private key from a public key with the Bitcoin protocol.  I do know I have to routinely spend an exhorbant amount of time reconfiguring a lot of web servers and updating their SSL certificates every time some new vulnerability gets published.  That's the nature of encryption.  If math can be used to encrypt it, eventually math can be used to break it once somebody figures out how.

I never knew that was missing from my life until now.

It's an even more serious problem than just being an obstacle for adoption.  Even after being used to it for years I still have to check and double check how many zeros are in my transaction every time I make a trade.  Losing thousands because you thought there was an extra zero behind the decimal that wasn't there is a very real danger.

Man... I get the humor but I really wish there were more posts about making Bitcoin useful instead of just constantly whacking off for upvotes.

Exactly.  Mindless crap like this is exactly why crypto never gets taken seriously, and it never will until people actually start using their heads.

I need money to do something important:
Property - Good thing I have all this equity by basically paying rent to myself.
Crypto - Fuck I hope these scratch-offs finally hit right.
Edit: This isn't meant to talk shit or downplay crypto, but be realistic people.  Land isn't going anywhere and you can live on it or borrow against it.  Crypto is like the Dark Souls of investment accounts and can't be used as collateral for anything.

I completely agree with OP's illiquidity argument.  I have had an easier time getting USD into an online casino than getting it into Bitcoin.  It takes about a week for Coinbase to go though (assuming you are even allowed to buy), and I've been trying to get verified by Bitstamp since Bitcoins were under $300.
