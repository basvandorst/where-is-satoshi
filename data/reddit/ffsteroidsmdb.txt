I figured out why it wasn't showing in those databases. We're apparently registered as a nonprofit corporation. Not sure what the distinction is, but you can find us by searching for our ID  here: 
I've included a screenshot of our info:

No but I can add one tonight. I'll let you know.

Nice, thanks for the suggestion!

Literally just finished posting it there.

Congrats on the success! And thanks so much for the donation!

Should be good to go now

We're still very new... MI status only, awaiting federal number.

We do work with college kids who willingly take it, so there's that. Sometimes a child still has symptoms after completing the steps in the Action Plan and medication is deemed necessary by the parent, or the parent wants to include low dosages with the regimen we set up. Whatever the reason we don't want anyone put on anything they don't need, a level higher than necessary, or a potentially dangerous combo.

Will do, thanks for the advice!

Like I said in the message I sent you, I'm not exactly high enough up in the organization to know exactly where the process stands for the federal number. As far as I know all the state guidelines were followed, and am not sure why it wouldn't show up there.
I had nothing to do with the application process to either MI or federal. If you don't feel comfortable donating, that's fine. I can really only comment on the work we do.

It didn't start that way, but as more coins were requested it seemed the competitive drive might help a bit.

Thanks so much!
