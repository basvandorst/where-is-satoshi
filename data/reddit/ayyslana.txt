I don't think that it's really BTC ATM
@_date: 2019-06-15 10:08:10
But how I wonder
@_date: 2019-06-15 10:51:49
Can you recommend a hardware wallet? Which one did you use?
@_date: 2019-06-15 08:19:25
There are no guarantees that after 7 years conditions would be better
@_date: 2019-02-03 09:18:40
didn't know it all before, Bitgold is something never existed, but it should be somehow invented in the future, right? 
@_date: 2019-02-19 06:37:43
Very competitive with existing services, and the acceptance of crypto puts it over the edge. Awesome. 
@_date: 2019-02-19 06:30:42
look, that's funny :D
@_date: 2019-02-11 05:55:44
How much is it?
@_date: 2019-06-15 11:51:03
Oh, that’s really dangerous�� I wouldn’t risk my life only for leaving a graffiti in a wall
@_date: 2019-02-19 06:32:19
 Now there's no excuse for the younger generation (literally everyone else) to say they can't learn how to use the [~~ ! ������
@_date: 2019-02-25 07:58:29

@_date: 2019-02-25 07:56:01

@_date: 2019-02-11 05:56:47
wow wow, patty that it's just $1
@_date: 2019-04-21 10:56:51
Yup, probably, you..lol, but looks really creative
@_date: 2019-04-28 15:32:33
Have somebody here ever tried to buy in such 'kiosks' BTC?
@_date: 2019-04-14 13:04:04
Fantastic! I wish I could receive it too!
@_date: 2019-04-21 15:27:33
Such a pity for owners to lose it I suppose
@_date: 2019-04-14 12:29:25
Mobile phone? What?
@_date: 2019-01-25 16:18:09
lool why Nokia? 
@_date: 2019-01-22 18:01:07
Or be a certificate on your wall...
@_date: 2019-01-25 16:07:32
Davos Seaworth presidential ad. looool
@_date: 2019-01-19 09:29:06
Loool... thats a bit sad... can somebody set up everything in such a way that we can go and buy smth with crypto? 
@_date: 2019-01-19 09:34:30
That’s the progress, let’s get it 
@_date: 2019-01-22 18:20:28
it depends.. there're lots of projects nowadays providing people opportunity to convert crypto into fiat immediately with the help of e-wallets.. I keep an eye on one interesting project. need to watch what it's all about
@_date: 2019-01-22 18:25:29
due to the market conditions there's possibility to see ghosts, unicorns, satoshi faster than $19000 worth BTC
@_date: 2019-01-17 08:39:40
A piece of Art ������������
@_date: 2019-01-22 18:10:04
I agree Bitcoin will be worth more than gold, but due to the recent changes in the market, we can't say what is exactly right, what is not 
@_date: 2019-01-22 18:14:01
This still works because the threat of the law and court is there and this makes people comply....
@_date: 2019-05-25 18:51:27
How much BTC all employees were paid in total?
@_date: 2019-05-04 13:14:13
I did my part lol
@_date: 2019-05-15 07:36:20
People who experienced 2017 know that BTC can get $20000 just in a week if possible
@_date: 2019-05-06 09:04:23
then every crypto enthusiast should look like something of this sort
@_date: 2019-05-11 07:11:19
Damn, it feels good to be a hodler
@_date: 2019-05-15 06:57:15
Microsoft’s choice of bitcoin is curious. I suppose, we'll see the adoption soon
@_date: 2019-05-26 14:57:52
lol no emotions at all
@_date: 2019-05-17 17:07:43
There are so many minds saying this that there here... but I should admit that if it’s tanking then we would witness what was in 2017 but since everything is controversial and the price is going up down suddenly a week after another it’s totally difficult to say anything
@_date: 2019-05-17 15:07:32
well, $800.000.000 at the present rate, he didn't know that BTC will go so far for sure
@_date: 2019-05-28 09:46:01
Nope, not now man
@_date: 2018-12-28 07:27:53
Oh my gosh it will lead to bull movement 
@_date: 2019-05-04 12:35:48
It's already [$5 800,48]( Congratulations!
@_date: 2019-05-25 09:11:43
lol then should we print btc only for this?
@_date: 2018-12-27 11:02:44
Anything that brings inconvenience will be shifted to something new afterwards 
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:38:19
I woke up immediately after checking Coinmarketcap and was pretty surprised
@_date: 2019-05-21 12:06:15
Has anybody watched? Any comments how is it?
@_date: 2019-05-12 06:10:56
Lol, that's even good. You wake you and check BTC's price and it's up again, what can be better?
@_date: 2019-05-25 09:54:34
Jesus! he should be a trader then if he makes such "give-aways"
@_date: 2019-05-06 06:58:47
[$5 688,38]( \- we're still far away from it! \^\^
@_date: 2019-05-01 10:13:00
hope to have one too in the future 8)
@_date: 2018-12-15 15:12:31
@_date: 2019-05-12 06:48:25
Me walking like this if the next week is going to be bullish
@_date: 2019-05-11 07:01:28
the state of all hodlers who have been waiting all this time.. You did great job guys!
@_date: 2018-12-27 11:10:27
It is expected and obvious I guess
@_date: 2018-12-27 11:04:04
It depends �� controversial 
@_date: 2018-12-27 10:56:31
��what a news ..
@_date: 2018-12-15 15:21:57
Look 
@_date: 2019-05-07 06:21:59
I believe that crypto is here to change everything
@_date: 2019-05-06 09:46:23
I suppose that the plan is not really good for small/medium businesses... They didn't worked out every aspect in this case
@_date: 2019-05-01 10:57:46
Even more should be coming soon, that's great!
@_date: 2019-05-07 07:22:59
Great! Let's fix it and go up till the end!
@_date: 2019-05-05 05:57:05
Isn't it dangerous? The platform looks a bit familiar
@_date: 2018-12-28 07:30:08
Bitcoin lost 75% of its value during one year.. ridiculous 
@_date: 2019-05-22 08:20:27
How many days have you spent to make this?
@_date: 2019-05-25 10:09:26
Where is it? they should think seriously about starting to accept BTC
@_date: 2019-05-06 09:29:56
Fair enough, hope we'll take the hype
@_date: 2019-05-12 06:40:19
Get ready to do even more push ups, cause we're in a bull run
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:20:26
This is bittersweet truth really
@_date: 2019-05-22 08:05:49
Appreciated! I wish one day I'll call local pizzeria and have my pizza for btc lol
