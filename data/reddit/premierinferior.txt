Check which banks didn't sell bad mortgage securities and check who owned them. Just one example of hundreds.

My argument is that Commerical Banks are owned by global elites. 
Commericial banks own all of the shares of each of the 12 branches of the fed. 
This gives them the power to influence who is on the board of the FED, incentivizes paying political parties to elect their choice for chair. 
Control of the fed allows them to influence money supply and interest rates. 
This allows them to control capital spending, mortgage payments, and asset prices among other things. 
I am not gullible and you know nothing about me. 
I am working to fix these things by being a proponent of decentralized currencies and studying to work in economic policy.

Also, this has nothing to do with me "having room to improve as a person" ad hom, pal.

Believe me, I get how it works. And I don't believe in an 'conspiracy theories' 
Even if you don't believe that - it's still clear that who the president chooses to be the chair and the way interest rates fluctuate are controlled by big banks.

What barrier is there to other cryptocurrencies simply taking over bitcoin? Why is the value so high - isn't it just people 'painting the tape'? How will bitcoin succeed in decentralizing?

Nothing I'm saying is conspiracy. You can look at public records to see which banks did and did not... 
Also I'm agreeing with what you are saying.

I'm an Economics major - it's very blatant that global elites influence political elections and create synthetic business cycles to grow their wealth.

I'm happy to listen to why you think I'm wrong. You haven't provided any counter

The rothschilds own the US Federal Reserve, friend.
