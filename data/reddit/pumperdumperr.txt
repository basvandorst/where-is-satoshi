I feel like we are ready for takeoff now. Lets start this massive bullrun now!
@_date: 2018-09-08 21:25:56
@_date: 2018-09-11 17:09:48
Same. But still scary investing more when not knowing if it will go to 4k or not. 
@_date: 2018-09-08 18:25:03
\*ding\* please fasten your seatbelt and raise your chairback all the way up.
@_date: 2018-09-25 17:12:05
@_date: 2018-09-20 11:43:43
wait just a while more
@_date: 2018-09-22 22:47:42
@_date: 2018-09-06 20:41:30
But why? if btc goes 10x (highly unlikely) I will not make a lot of money. alt coins might go 50x and a shit ton of money is to made? I dont get this. 
@_date: 2018-09-08 21:00:13
it was worth 100$ a few years ago. Imagine the price in a few more years. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 10:30:45
@_date: 2018-09-06 20:19:28
im wondering the same
@_date: 2018-09-12 20:53:38
I like you, man ! 
@_date: 2018-09-08 21:10:19
How come all coins dump at the same time? I mean, even stuff like NEO Gold etc. Are whales in every coin dumping at the same time? I dont get it
@_date: 2018-09-09 10:01:48
What is bart?
@_date: 2018-09-08 21:34:16
If you look at what happened in 2014, its pretty damn similar to what we see now, Its the market cycle. The same people that pump the shit out of btc last year, are the same people dumping it early this year, and they will pump it and dump it as long as they please. 
@_date: 2018-09-08 21:11:24
RogerCoin ! haha! 
@_date: 2018-09-07 20:45:36
Is it REALLY better to use months to buy 1 full bitcoin, before buying altcoins? 
@_date: 2018-09-07 21:09:24
Thanks for the reply. I agree 100%
@_date: 2018-09-17 15:52:30

@_date: 2018-09-20 09:03:07
@_date: 2018-09-08 22:17:53

@_date: 2018-09-10 15:33:31

@_date: 2018-09-24 21:05:20
Rims are big with this one. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 20:19:40
Im gonna put all my saving into crypto, and I have 2 two questions:   
\-Should I do it now?   
\- Should I buy only BTC, or some alt coins also? 
@_date: 2018-09-25 15:48:59
AAAAAND its gone. 
@_date: 2018-09-18 21:07:19
Dear OP. In 46 days, 4 hours, 8 minutes and 34 seconds it will stop going down.   
And in 67 days, 22hours 1 minute and 3 seconds it will start going up.  I hope this answered your question :)

@_date: 2019-06-21 09:55:40
Hello. Just reminding you that you nor anybody else know what will happen. I don't blame you though, its a basic human instinct to try to find patterns that are not there and   "know" things you simply dont have a clue about.
@_date: 2019-02-18 15:48:40
And THEKEY.
@_date: 2019-02-07 22:23:50
