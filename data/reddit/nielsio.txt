I discuss the issue of reserves here: 
The rest of what you say only seems to be in support of the fact that gold and diamonds have trading value, as they have substantial use value. Use in industry instead of as jewelry is not somehow bad.

Uses 1 to 4 are not uses of Bitcoin items that give them value. Those actions require Bitcoin items to have value in the first place.
5 is a very bad reason to use Bitcoin for intermediate exchange, as it is far too unreliable. I address this point in my article.

Gold and diamonds are part of the production cycle in our society. They are continually being used. That is the reason there is a point to storing them and holding them.
I am the author of the video in the OP.
FYI: Here is my far more formalized and in-depth article on the topic:

I don't just intend to save others for its own sake (although what's wrong with that?), I actually consider it a huge waste of time and resources. An analogous situation would be the housing bubble. Resources were lost that could have been used better, and it had effects outside of those investing in it.

It's possible to do intermediate exchanges with tulips are $1,000/flower during a craze. But the fact that some people today are willing to make those purchases (which make intermediate exchanges possible), doesn't mean intermediate exchange will remain to be possible at stable rates.

Shifting Bitcoin units around between different people would be valuable if those Bitcoin units had value outside of the network, but it doesn't.

Building things on top of the Bitcoin network can only work if Bitcoins have value in the first place. It cannot be the thing that gives it value.

The sidebar of the Bitcoin subreddit ('Common Myths'  ) links to here: 
*"The subjective theory of value is a theory of value which advances the idea that the value of a good is not determined by any inherent property of the good, nor by the amount of labor required to produce the good, but instead value is determined by the importance an acting individual places on a good for the achievement of their desired ends.[1] This theory is one of the core concepts of the Austrian School of Economics. While the modern version of this theory was discovered independently and nearly simultaneously by William Stanley Jevons, Léon Walras, and Carl Menger in the late 19th century it had in fact been advanced in the Middle Ages and Renaissance but did not gain widespread acceptance at that time."*
It's those darned flat earth economists again!

Recording transactions in a public way is very easy to do. With a handful of servers (at 5$/month a piece) and some basic code, you can have it. Want it secure for really serious applications? Add a couple hundred bucks for SSL certificates and some other reputation aspects.
Money is something else entirely.
