Not for old addresses like satoshis coins. Everything that is not moved to new quantum safe addresses can be stolen.

The problem is all the old addresses that don't move coins. E.g. satohis coins are up for grabs.

RemindMe! 8 years "quantum computing qubits"
At current pace IBM is quadrupling the number of qubits per 18 months. We probably can expect that to slow down to doubling all 18 months. That still means cracking bitcoin is only a few years away.
You can be pessimist and believe that will not continue. But many people doubted moore's law for normal CPUs, but it is still going (we just have more cores now, and transistors are smaller than many people thought would be physically possible, and we can still switch to photons instead of electrons).

That post does not address the major issue: quantum computers.
In a few years they should have enough q-bits to crack bitcoin private keys. No idea if the core devs have a plan for that.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:48:10
Why that? Because encrypted internet connections are crackable? No, they can just switch to resistant crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:44:31
IBM has it already. You will be able to rent it in cloud. And the number of q-bits is growing exponentially each year. So no, this is not far off.
Also, you don't need many q-bits to crack bitcoin. So it will be in the next few years. This has nothing to do with techno-optimist, just realism.

I write about the specific problem that exchanges have (withdrawal). Which the exchange can solve by using segwit for withdrawals. No idea what you are talking about. I don't talk about legacy other users do, if users want to use legacy, it is their problem. The exchange can solve its problem by using segwit for withdrawals.
@_date: 2017-08-05 12:45:34


No, SegWit would fix it.
These are transactions of the exchange, and the exchange can just send Segwit transactions only, so he does not have that problem.
@_date: 2017-08-05 13:11:39
Their problem are withdrawals. That is solved by using segwit on their side. It has to do with reusing output of transactions in the same block, that problem does not exist with user deposits. Which could be legacy, no problem. So yes, this problem the exchange has is solved if they do segwit withdrawals.
@_date: 2017-08-05 12:54:03


They could. But it is tricky, as you see because it is the reason they had to halt withdrawals.
With segwit that problem does not exist: the exchange sends all withdrawals as segwit, problem solved.
Legacy are only a problem for those that use them, so if you send legacy you have the risk, you alone.

I have a problem with this assumption:


What if I am a miner and don't like 2nd/3rd layer solutions? I try to join as many groups as possible and force them all to settle. Such an actor has something to gain, actually 2 things:
* payment channels get a bad name
* average fee size increases because there are many more transactions on the main chain

It solves this:




The BTC1 thing is a rushed cluster fuck. They could do it in a smart way like the idea in this comment. But it is too late, they cannot change everything this late.
Maybe they try to get that effect by manipulating the signaling, so that the activations are at the same time? Are other pools doing this too? This would need coordination (and luck...).
@_date: 2017-07-19 03:15:13
Yes, but their (non-BTC1) peers will not send them the blocks other BTC1 miners mined, so each will create their own chain. And most nodes are non-BTC1. If you connect atm you will probably have zero BTC1 peers.

Yep, I read it like that too. But the trolls want to troll...
