You are a thoughtful person -- we simply have fundamental disagreements that are not going to be moved by arguing on the internet.

Who would trust a knock-off device with their coins?

We shall see. To be honest, they are the canary in the coal mine.

Yep -- you are totally right! The world is simple and black and white. The black people who are shot by cops deserve it; everyone in the 1% deserves all of their money because they work harder than everyone else and are more productive. 
You are totally right.

No one is blaming anyone -- both situations (obesity and government spending) are FAR more complicated than simple decisions.
When McDonald's is the only high calorie, tasty food you can afford (as is the case in MANY, MANY American communities), you really cannot blame people for going there. They are not necessarily making a simple decision.
The same is true with Greece. Why blame the country and not the reckless investors who bought Greek bonds? They knew what they were doing as well. 
Hence the problem of the Euro zone -- Greece has no control over its monetary policy. They literally do not have the tools to pay this debt, and they are in a hole they are never going to get out of. How are they supposed to create tax revenue when over 50% of young people are unemployed? 
Millions of Greek people (citizens of one of the WEALTHIEST unions in HISTORY) are suffering through the direst poverty, all because there is no political will to work through these issues. What is done is done -- a new way must be found, but the the creditors and debtors must share part of the blame. If Greece was a conscious, rational party, so were the creditors. 
It's fine and dandy for Merkel to act tough and say that the Greeks put themselves in this mess, but that's an extremely simplistic view of what is actually going on -- finance is extremely complicated and blaming a single party is tantamount to an admission that you do not know what is going on.

Uh... This is stupid. 
We don't need more exchanges. We need more more ease of use and more merchants accepting Bitcoin...

Greece's problem is not just beginning (they have crippling poverty) and is due in large part to Euro zone monetary policy. It's crazy to think what works in Germany will work in Italy or Greece.
