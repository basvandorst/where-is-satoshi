Nope. Arguments can be indicative of truths while still being arguments, if you don't know why this fact is relevant then :(




No self-awareness
Unironically using this as an insult

'The moon is made of cheese and anyone who says otherwise is wrong' VS 'I feel like the moon might be made of cheese'
You can feel like all day but if you are trying to make statements based on reality you should understand what your talking about and not just gut feeling economic theory based on a YouTube video. Appealing to authority is one way to bolster an argument, it should not be taken as absolute fact obv but it certainly lends credence to a claim made within the authority's speciality. I actually thought you were responding to another comment but my point still stands. 
Having read the correct thread your whole comment is ridiculous, the guy didn't swing his degree dick around, someone asked him specifically to give his credentials...

A misinformed opinion claiming to be fact is a problem. Making a claim and calling it factual is not just having an opinion.

Doesn't matter how many teams of analysts you have, you are talking about predicting the behavior of billions of people over years and are assuming exchanges won't be closed/regulated. The other fact is unless people actually start using it as a currency there is a very slim chance it will bubble indefinately upward and even if it does a bubble that big is very susceptible to popping (small recession, people pull out of riskier investments, bye bye bitcoin). Anyone who is confidently making predictions on bitcoin (just as with the stock market) is not being genuine or is an idiot, and to believe it makes for either a sucker or a follower of an idiot.

Lololol get ready to delete your comments, you misread the thread bud. Your first two quotes are from different people[1](
Which, if you read my comment, is why I said 'someone asked him specifically for his credentials'.
Arguing from authority is not a fallacy if the topic at hand is within that authorities speciality such as with education. 
He was clearly being informal ('Studied economics' would be just as incomplete a sentence)
We're on a roll now
"They're going to conflate fact with opinion - whether you like it or not. It's not going to change. It's you're responsibility to distinguish between the two, because nobody else will."
Just going to let this one hang dawg.

I said he is either an idiot or not being genuine, clearly you are in the sucker category
