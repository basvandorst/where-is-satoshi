I agree, my point was to draw a historical parallel, a metaphor. Bitcoin is not the answer, but as of right now, it represents to closest thing to one. I don't have a solution, you don't have a solution, but i'll bet (literally) that the blockchain tech that Bitcoin has pioneered will be the innovative foundation for any solution, or more likely, remedy to gov't issues like corruption.
As I said in a different comment, I don't think chunks of encrypted data are gonna replace the federal gov't, but rather supplement it. Something something, in order to form a perfect union. I also think that the globalization trend will be a big factor in that future governmental development, but that's a whole other story

By the way, I don't think Bitcoin is the solution nor that blockchain tech will replace central institutions, but instead supplement them. I'm not a blockchain-or-die fanatical type.

[Forgive me]( for I have been procrastinating looking up the difference since 2006.
Please sir, read my shit.

True, too much of a good thing can become a bad thing.

I completely agree! Maybe I wasn't clear, I am not talking about the hour by hour effect on BTC prices. It may be the reason for that jump, may not be. I'm talking about the broader implications, display of centralized organization cons, public perception, adoption, etc.
But I AM saying that this shutdown will likely indirectly boost the long term growth of blockchain tech, specifically Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-21 02:33:54
Like I said, I'm talking about the big picture, the perceptions, etc. The fact that a single entity (or node, if you will), CAN shutdown the entire institution is one of the negatives that blockchain tech wants to avoid.
By shutting down the gov't, congress displays this inherent issue with centralized organizations. Bitcoin, unlike in 2013, is part of the mainstream representing the opposite, a decentralized organization, drawing the public attention to the fact there are emerging solutions to the underlying issue.
It's important to remember that the American republic was created with analogous situations. A single monarch can disrupt colonists lives' from across an ocean? Let's *decentralize* that and make three groups all check and balance each other!

[Political and financial instability, public services threatened, public employees possibly don't get paid, perception of weakness, etc.](
Literally took me 10 seconds to google this, just FYI.

Exactly! It’s not likely to dramatically hurt the economy, therefore BTC investors are not prone to panic selling, yet at the same time its a symbolic reassurance to the anti-Central-institutionists. Just look at the posts on this sub at the time of shutdown and you’ll see what I mean.

That's not what I was saying... I gave two paths a tech startup could follow. One is growing to become its own "large corp", the other is getting bought out by a different "large corp". If you re-read my comment, you'll see the only thing I said was the same is the incentive and risk-reward trade offs of the two different possibilities cause. The words "corporation" and "independent" and whatever else you're focusing on have little to do with the real issue of *Risk-to-Reward Ratio.*
Edit: If you observed the keyword "instead" in my prior comment, idk how you misinterpreted that sentence the way you did..

Really interesting! I've been looking at a lot of what goes on there and the rest of Antarctic posts and thought perhaps I'd look into of whats required for working a season there. Mostly just to get that experience while I still have the ability to and to see the continent before it gets even more disconfigured.
Any related advice or experience you'd be able to share? Idk if you've stayed there long term or not but I don't know a whole of people who have so figured i'd ask.
@_date: 2018-06-20 03:04:39
Yeah figured, thanks anyways though.

sunlight nearly all day during summers... someone should try to set up a seasonal node running on solar. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 01:18:46
And... how is that different from what the above commenter said? The incentive of tech startups looking for acquisition offers is the same as if they instead turned their company into a large independent corp. Both scenarios start with high risk-low reward and end with low risk-high reward... because the incentive to do so is the same. The tech startup being bought out by facebook or amazon or whoever is just expediting that process and usually get a lower reward or higher risk than the large corp route as a trade of.

The internet reliability and speed would be the biggest issue though. Plus if some hardware breaks down you're  out of luck until you get off the continent. Maybe not that great an idea actually.

For monitoring prices, I use TradingView since you can look at all sorts of cryptos on all sorts of exchanges. Also it shows you a news feed related to crypto/blockchain.
For buying, I can't really help you since it depends on where you live. I'm a US resident and trade against the Dollar so I'm not sure where you could buy and trade against the Rupee as an Indian resident.

Sums up the entire argument nicely there. Also thanks for letting me know it's been posted already!

Probably gonna be a bunch of people here who have some disagreements to the opinion side of this video, which is fine. I'd like to hear your thoughts on it.
@_date: 2018-03-31 05:50:58
Good luck!
@_date: 2018-03-23 20:03:40
Lol yeah I definitely agree but I think the general public, that hasn't been following btc prices or news, still needs to digest pre-Dec. '17 info and developments of bitcoin to get into the market and to drive adoption. 
That's why I still like to watch and think about these sorts of videos cause it's what the next wave of adopters are gonna use as their base knowledge in deciding whether or not to adopt.

The video was what made me download your app tbh, props to the Fiverr guy. I've been involved in video/photo production and graphic design for some time now and so I was really glad that the visual impression wasn't like a lot of the other crypto apps out there. The logo and UI color scheme could be better though. I know that the orange accent comes from the standard bitcoin color, but it doesn't work well with many other colors. 
Anyways, I love the app so far, definitely see it as unique and has a ton of potential.
If you're ever in need of some graphics, photos, or videos worked on in the future, give me a holler! I do freelance on the side so price is always flexible and cryptocurrency is accepted ;)

As in... how I dug up this 2-yo comment? Or how someone could be still excited about Bitcoin after 2 years?
1. I was working on a presentation and needed to find some info on Jesse Powell and found it after scrolling way down the AMA
1. Because seeing your bitcoins' value increase fifty-fold in less than 2 years probably has a similar level of addictiveness as cocaine.

Becoming "that guy from the future" in finance/tech industries can give you the power to dictate the future, and vice versa.

If your risk tolerance isn't that high but you're looking for a longer term investment, cost-average into the market. As the price moves down buy just a small amount every so often until it goes back up and assess your gains/losses.
Start with a just a little bit for the first buy and see what happens and wait a few days to a week before buying significantly more bitcoin. Watch the charts and how your investment does. Even if you've traded stocks or fx before, you won't really be able to understand how this market moves until you're in the game. Don't go throwing 1 lakh in as soon as your first purchase yields 10%.
I think more importantly though, **learn about the technology** behind bitcoin and understand why and how it is attracting buyers. You should at least know the basics of what it is you are investing in before you actually do.

Same here! Being in a STEM field with major interests in economics, political science, journalism, etc, I think just going along for the ride on an important emerging technology is worth it. I can't wait to see what sorts of major applications will come from blockchain tech, many of the best ones are probably still scarcely conceivable too.
