Agreed... besides if anything they are being preserved ��

These posts are a whole new kettle of fish.

It’s just my opinion but based on adoption/ brand awareness e.g
- I’ve never seen any crypto atms apart from bitcoin. I don’t see coinX accepted here stickers in shop windows. But I do for Bitcoin.
- Bitcoin dominates the news (be that for positive or negative reasons)
- This is personal to me but people I know who can’t even use a smartphone properly have heard of Bitcoin but don’t know what an altcoin is, let alone name one.
- As the first mover it gets centre stage and acceptance first for things like futures trading, regulation etc. That means it is seen as the leader.
- As a web developer I get far more requests for Bitcoin integration than for a smaller altcoin.
- Every other currency is paired with it (at least for now).
I’m not for a second suggesting it’s the best or the most advanced crypto but BTC will remain king for quite some time yet.

Bitcoin is not anti-progression. As the first, largest and most used cryptocurrency it has a responsibility to not hastily implement untested/ half baked solutions.
Lightening is already now live, as is segwit. I’m sure it will be improved in many other ways over time.

Surely this guys trolling? I mean how did he manage to go through the process of buying bitcoin and not realise this /facepalm

Bitcoin bubble confirmed ��
@_date: 2017-08-10 06:30:33
I've not used it personally but given they have a whole page on taking bitcoin payments I would say yes �� 
Also lots of payment providers like Stripe, Braintree accept bitcoin now so I imagine integration is relatively easy.
Then there are specialist 3rd parties like Bitpay as well.
Lots of options ����, good luck

As everyone else mentions use local bitcoins but only sell using a bank transfer. Unlike card purchases a bank transfer does not allow the user to carry out a chargeback which imo is the safest/ convenient way.

I have not installed yet (not at my mbp) but this is a very cool idea!
Do the values permanently show on the touch bar or do you have to hold down a certain key to temporarily view?
Also given that the touch bar turns to standby when not in use how do you get around this?
@_date: 2017-08-06 08:24:58
I'm not sure if it's possible but I have my touch bar set up in old school mode where if I press the function key the bar values show f1,f2 etc.
How about having an option to assign a short cut to similarly show the crypto values. I'm assuming this would also get around the standby issue as the bar could wake/ change when pressing the short cut?

Even though its through franchises the more exposure Bitcoin can leverage through popular mainstream brands the better. This is awesome!
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:48:53
That actually sounds pretty responsible and mature of them. It shows whatever the outcome they genuinely do want the best for Bitcoin.
Time to watch Ethereum moon...

You could use something like 
Just buy the btc for cash (transfer) and send it to polo address, then use the btc for whatever you like. It's pretty quick, no bank fees. Only available in certain countries though I think.

BTC (30%)
ETH (30%)
XMR (15%)
IOTA (10%)
Split the remaining 15% in to cheaper (riskier) coins that have good goals, teams and development, have a solid team and good track record within the community (research this yourself). Maybe start by reading more about GNT, ARDR, OMG, PIVX, SAFEX etc. If you don’t want to buy any smaller coins, play the 15% safer by just splitting it between BTC and ETH.
IMO the above is a safe option for long term holding (at least a couple of years)

Thank the lord for bitcoin headquarters ��

@_date: 2017-09-10 06:42:19
There are so many. It also depends on what coins you will be storing, If you will be storing long term or need quick access etc.
Maybe look at Jaxx, Exodus, MyEtherWallet etc.

Little substance and full of air... nice ��

Wow, thats awful. Another stark reminder why keeping to much on an exchange can end in tears.
The more control you have over your own funds the better.
Gutted for those affected though.

It isn't just bitcoin or twitter related but why not check out: [ 
If you click the news sources tab in the sidebar you will notice it has a number of twitter related crypto influencers who you could then just go ahead and follow within your own twitter account ��
Full disclaimer. I built the hobby site to keep up to date with the latest crypto news ��. **Realtime** sources include mainstream media, crypto news sites, blogs, tech sites, finance/ investor news, ICO, project news, twitter etc.
Good luck ��

Wow that sucks ☹️ ... what a joke. If you don't mind me asking was it regular small amounts or a large chunk that caused this?
Good luck moving forward though ����
@_date: 2017-06-01 10:41:42
Wow thats awesome news!
@_date: 2017-06-11 08:44:30
That's awful, another reason why the banks need to be replaced by an impartial, autonomous intermediary. One that doesn't screw over customers for its self gain.
Hopefully you didn't lose any money in the process, best of luck ��
