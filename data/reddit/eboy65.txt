If you're using CoinPrism's implementation. There is a small trading platform that is compatible at  
This runs on Blockstrap and will require every user to back up their Salt and protect it as they would a private key. Every 'trade' will require both parties to sign the transaction. This will limit the ability to do multiple mass trades, and limit users to 1 active trade per wallet until the second party signs the transaction. There are a number of Colored Coins already being traded there. Some of which no longer are backed by anything or have grown obsolete. 
This approach allows for the user to still hold control of their wallets/keys as this data isn't transmitted to a server and lives on the user's browser side, just as a standard wallet, the user will want to ensure their system is secure in order to protect themselves from theft.
There is always support in Slack - 
or on the forums

One could argue that pool mining is also creating a centralization of the coin :-P. Now nit picking aside, which pool do you run? As i am unaware.

Then what do you need for proof? And how can it be offered? Instead of doing any research and reviewing the service, you've only been perceived to put up a wall and immediately disregard any and all answers provided.

The cloud platform is not a requirement to participate. Only a 'color aware' wallet. 
The rest of your argument doesn't matter due to that alone.

 - Asset holding information - Payouts, fees, how the funds were received, etc. - Asset holder addresses with amount/percentages held no personal information accessible due to being on block chain, no databases.
 - Hashpower distribution - Transactions going in and out of the wallets. 
Utilization of Blockchain 2.0 tech is not bad for Bitcoin.

Thanks for the response on the pool. 
Smart property ASICs would be great, but you are correct, so far the well known ASIC manufacturers aren't working on that, their function is to make money and pull what they can out of a chip. Not so much the expanded functionality of the chips/boards.

Many were just members of other communities. As for last names, i'll get with the team to start adding those for the core portions of the team members.

Cloud is running on blockstrap system.
Payments are processed through 'Colored Coins' Blockchain 2.0's asset system. Which pays directly to user controlled wallets. (Blockstrap provides you with your private keys, which are also saved in your SALT) or you can use coinprism, which also gives you full control.
Everything can be seen running through this system.
There is no database holding of user's accounts, wallets, nor personal information. 
Pictures are not necessary when everything is posted there automatically and you can trace it back yourself through the chain. 
Decentralization is what crypto was founded on, utilizing the blockchain for crowd mining is better for crypto than another overnight service that stores everything on their servers and can cry 'hack' and run off.

Started as a community project as an experiment, in response to the continual scams going on. We wanted to test out the color coins and if they could become a viable replacement to the typical database 'online wallet' structure. To begin moving away from being another site that can utilize poor security (which you can also do any test you'd like, for not storing wallets, or user databases, our security is top notch) and cry hack and run off with everyone's funds.
Currently we only bring in income from the GHX each team member holds from their own purchases. You can utilize the information so far provided to identify if more GHX were created and dispersed than actual hardware power backing the coins. 
As for the business backing, we'll have this up in the next couple of weeks, due to the nature of it being a community experiment, we weren't positive how much further we would progress into the project. With the outcome so far, we've decided that we will continue to grow and improve with BTC and other crypto where we can. 
When this is completed, it will be added to the sites.

Currently, we have been discussing if there would be a viable way to allow coin holders a way to mine themselves, where they can point and identify themselves while still covering the hosting costs, this is virtually impossible, short of providing them with their own proxies and holding the hardware hostage daily.
As for proof-of-work to the publishing of near misses of blocks being mined, how is this achieved via multiple pools?
$100k was barely enough to cover expenses on batch 1. The team didn't earn a cent from this crowd funding.

I'll get on this and see if we can get this working.
The mission here isn't to be 'the next big thing' or to become 'another' cloud mining service. We're attempting to provide transparency and bring an honest, trustworthy platform online which is as decentralized as possible from hardware, to payouts. 
We will take every idea, explanation, or question and do the best with what we have to answer it. 
I'll work on this one and post it in the slack to the team now.

I picked up a few from  for my family this year as well.
