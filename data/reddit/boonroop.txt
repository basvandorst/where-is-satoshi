you could mix up the order of the words if you can remember it.
read somewhere that even if some bad guy has your seed words but not the correct order it still would take too long to crack it. correct?
@_date: 2019-03-13 16:08:58
you could code them, 
make poem with them,
use words as some made up quote.
sudoku 
am i correct i can use seedwords to get public address too, so i dont have to store even this one ?
@_date: 2019-03-01 01:17:59

@_date: 2019-08-19 23:06:24

@_date: 2019-10-02 18:02:04
why are people protesting? did they honestly believed that they are not under control of china? i have never considered hong kong as not part of china. you know how hongkong city makes money? they rent out land, not sell but rent, and land costs billions with a B . Are hongkongster really so naive that they thing china will give up that? never.
@_date: 2019-10-03 02:44:56
you have freedom to protest speech etc. but under chinese rules. there is no autonomy I as a outsider have always visioned hongkong as part of china, i think most of the world has. 
who promised you those freedoms? china. whoever who controls rules, controls game.
@_date: 2019-08-16 01:01:53
nah, refusing to pay taxes is that one.
@_date: 2019-08-04 02:14:18

you are bittorrent or tron fanboy. 
cz binance is not a legend, dont dilute the word.
@_date: 2019-02-26 17:34:49
it should not compare but. when bitcoin is using less power than banking system then this is already "green" money. its not wasteful, banking is.
@_date: 2019-02-05 04:08:36
i have used airbnb many times and that part where he emailed airbnb links , got me hella confused too.

underestimated? did you meant overestimated? or you really think it takes years more to get full adoption?
@_date: 2019-02-17 01:44:29
point of LN is that its cheap to use, so probably cents.
@_date: 2019-02-05 23:49:07
for tourists seeing bitcoin ad live might feel like sightseeing something awesome, i would snap photo of that too.
@_date: 2019-02-14 22:56:02

@_date: 2019-06-15 10:22:55
and those charities are doing what ? done what?
fucking AKON, the singer, invested millions to bring solar lights to africa,  but when it comes to buffet and idiots like him, they are always donating to charities but nothing changes. we have billions to donate but we dont have drinkable water for everyone? Fuck off with this donated to charities shit.

@_date: 2019-04-27 22:10:42
