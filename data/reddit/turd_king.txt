Very nice I'm switching to your app from tabtrader. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:49:57
Probably because some major exchanges like bitfinex adding ETH pairs to every coin.

Monzo is much faster than my main bank. Transfers seem to be instant. If not a few hours
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:16:48
True. It won't be technically turing complete , it won't be able to execute *any* algorithm because that would be completely infeasible for the network.
But yeah what I was trying to point out is the advantages of allowing your blockchain to run as a automata. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:38:44
I was more referring to Bitcoin.
UNIX arrived in the 1970s - there was little to no competition at this time.
Who knows? If there were as many options for Open source operating systems in 1970 as there are for blockchain technologies today maybe Linux wouldn't be the most prevalent technology?
Developers worked on Linux because it was the best at the time by miles, there was no competition at all. 
Today there are several big competitors with Bitcoin and its not ridiculous to assume one project could implement something that could propel blockchain forward.

Thanks for your input
@_date: 2018-03-21 15:06:20
Still doesn't mean it won't be replaced by another open source project.
@_date: 2017-09-09 13:34:46
Well. You can be an expert on blockchain and that is pretty much enough. You won't lose your shit when you read fake news articles.
If you understand the fundamentals and what it can potentially one day do for the world; you only need to know how to buy more.
@_date: 2017-09-10 12:22:31
Yeah well I think the two go hand in hand
@_date: 2018-03-21 19:26:58
Implying you've thought of every conceivable outcome
@_date: 2017-07-21 11:26:03
Pro TA: Can confirm price will continue to either go up or go down.
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:00:08
Why would you not trade? The past month has potentially been the most profitable month for trading price fluctuations are only going to get more drastic as August approaches.

Of course global warming is real but you wouldn't notice the change locally.

Polo continues unphased *as usual*. I swear every complaint about exchanges never seems to apply to Polo
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:59:05
Yeah okay Dan 
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:51:42
You are entirely correct. And I'm sure the same concerns were brought up when JavaScript was first conceived - although obviously the early internet did not have the same potential for mass network hacking 
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:57:07
If pioneers regarded Turing completeness as a property of something that is a "trash nightmare" then none of us would be sitting on our devices arguing about blockchain.
@_date: 2017-06-13 07:53:23
This is extremely surprising to me that he would say this. 
I haven't been following ETH on any social media just been reading various books on solidity and Ethereum , and everyone of these books has wrote home about how Ethereum is Turing Complete as is Solidity (smart contract language). 
Solidity features looping , if statements and expressional syntax as well as statements that write and read from memory - to me this indicates Turing Completeness 
I have no idea what he is trying to achieve and this actually makes me 10x more sceptical
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:53:31
Ha.ha.ha yeah thanks - i could just as easily claim you are a first year student. 
 Have you heard of gas? How does the halting problem present a problem when there is a limit to how long the contract can execute? Completely redundant statement.
The blockchain of Babel? I'm not entirely sure how it relates to Babel? Babel is pretty much industry standard so I'm not sure where you are going with this one
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:14:07
When you start your article with 


And go on to claim the value comes purely from greed - it is pretty much implied in the subtext 
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:01:16
What? Explain. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:31:08
This article is nothing more than propaganda written by a huge investor in BTC.
He has absolutely no technical knowledge of blockchain and is in no position to claim ether has no value.
As a developer who has invested in BTC and several Altcoins - I can honestly say the only blockchain implementation I will be developing applications for is Ethereum's implementation.
EVM is [Turing Complete]( for one. 
Also it's hilarious that you bring up Segwit with obviously no understanding of tech - otherwise you would not be linking this garbage article.
Although I'd say a good portion of this sub have no clue how blockchain works, they just spout the latest article they read as fact
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:23:03
Well encryptedcharms that was a rivetting input to this topic. 
Care to elaborate on how Turing Complete blockchain = Trash Nightmare? 
@_date: 2017-06-13 13:26:42
I'm sorry but you have literally brought nothing of any value to this discussion. No sources. No facts , just name calling and accusations. Its quite cleary you who does not understand the halting problem - otherwise you would provide a valuable response.
Do you write program code? Or are you just regurgitating the latest articles that fit your agenda?
You can check out [wikipedia]( if you want to learn more about the halting problem.
Or you can check out the [Ethereum White pages]( for an example of how it can be worked around.
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:24:24
The author has no technological standing or experience and yet he claims ether has no value?
Anyone with a smidgen of knowledge on the Ethereum network will know fine rightly the value of ether.
Turing Complete Blockchain - this in itself is enough to encourage developers. 
Just feel like he has no credentials to discuss the merits of Ethereum when he is looking at it from the position of a bean counter.
So many of you have been linking me to what[ Vitalik Buterin said on Twitter]( 
:"Turing Completeness is a red herring"
I'm 100% certain this statement has been completely misunderstood by most people. He was simply meaning that in terms of transferring digital assets "rich statefullness" is more important , ie Turing Completeness was a red herring in the **value of the protocol** - every book on Ethereum and Solidity that I've read has suggested that the EVM is Turing Complete. 
Hell, even go and write some Solidity yourselves and tell me that you don't think its Turing Complete - it features loops , expressions and statements that can read and write from memory.
[Here is the Ethereum White paper on this topic](
And after reading some of the comments here I will also link you [to the following comment](
Some of you seem determined to divide the crypto community with the attitudes you portray on these forums.
@_date: 2017-06-13 14:25:03
Yet again irrelevant statements. Gas serves several purposes like a workaround to the halting problem. Gas does not prevent widescale attacks on the DAO.
I reckon you start your long journey into this topic with[ this page]( . Good luck. And don't hurt yourself too much
@_date: 2017-06-13 10:47:52
Exactly, that why I never believe articles like this. The crypto market isn't as easily analyzed as all these day traders think.
@_date: 2017-06-13 07:18:02
Well what languages do these devs use then? If you are saying Turing Completeness is an indication on how "prone to bugs" a language is I recommend you do some more reading. 
Here is a list of some Turing Complete languages :
* C/C++
* Java
* Lisp , Ada, R , Pascal
Would you say the same about C? Or C++? 
Turing completeness is an abstract statement of ability, rather than a prescription of specific language features used to implement that ability. 
Turing completeness in declarative SQL is implemented through recursive common table expressions.[4] Unsurprisingly, procedural extensions to SQL (PLSQL, etc.) are also Turing complete. **This illustrates one reason why relatively powerful non-Turing-complete languages are rare:** the more powerful the language is initially, the more complex are the tasks to which it is applied and the sooner its lack of completeness becomes perceived as a drawback, encouraging its extension until it is Turing complete.
Also to say you would go back in time and kill off JavaScript shows absolute minimum understanding of the web and the progress it has seen through JavaScript. 
Weak typing != Turing Complete.
Minecraft is Turing Complete for Gods sake.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:48:23
I'm open to learn but I cannot find any sources about what you claim
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:53:26
I don't think it's unfair to say this article has a clear bias towards BTC - and I think what you have said here is true for bitcoins evaluation as well. The difference is that a Turing Complete Blockchain opens the doors in terms of computing applications and this will ultimately bring many software developers into the project - I'd say a lot of investors have this in mind.
Also this is just my personal opinion , and I welcome other views. I prefer to keep these conversations​ civil

Wow you got me spot on /s
Thing is - you have to realise not everyone is a partisan in the crypto world. Some people actually support several currencies based on their technical merits.
So what because I point out that the author has no clue about the technicalities of the blockchain that means that I instantly hate BTC and only support ETH? 
@_date: 2017-06-13 10:52:39
Check original post
@_date: 2017-06-13 10:32:45
I'm tired of this statement being referenced. Vitalik in the same thread - then links [the White Paper on Turing Completeness](
First sentence :


The amount of people who keep saying this without even understanding what it means. Write some Solidity and tell me you don't think its Turing Complete.
@_date: 2017-06-13 10:56:24
You can analyze the market all you want but it won't change the fact that *if the cryptomarket is in a huge speculative bubble* then once it pops.
Only an analysis of the underlying technologies will provide you any indication of the future of said companies - staring at your charts will not help you here.

Page 59 - first paragraph -
[Introducing Ethereum and Solidity Foundations of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Programming for Beginners](


[From the Ethereum frontier guide on gas]


And finally for the third time i've linked it .. the [Ethereum White Paper which you are incapable of reading](




So yes. Keep on refusing to look at the sources I am linking you. 
Just because *the point of gas* wasn't to solve the halting problem. Doesn't mean that it doesn't solve it.
And I'm sorry but what "simple explanations" have you given me?
I have had civil discussions with other people in this thread who have actually given me things to look up and read about - but you? **Nah.** What have you given me to learn?
You are the toxic defender of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-13 08:06:53
I disagree. I've replied to several comments about the Halting Problem - where did you hear that this would prove to be a problem for smart contracts? 
Ethereum has a workaround to the Halting Problem in the form of "gas". A contract can only execute for as long as it has the gas to execute - there is no uncertainty. 
In the EVM, when one account increases, the system makes sure it’s because another 
account has sent a payment, and thus decreased the same amount. It’s a closed system. 
It’s practically impossible to give yourself free ether, or at least it wouldn’t be worth 
the costs you’d incur trying falsify the ledger. Ethereum uses financial incentives and 
disincentives for security.
