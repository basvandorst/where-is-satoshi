To operate this business in the state of New York, we must comply with regulations. For transactions over $800 per day we must have an ID on file with a limit of $3,000 per day. The phone number is just proving that customers aren't exceeding the daily limits.

Yes, we will be adding two way models to NYC in the near future.

CoinSource machines operate at 8%... Lowest in New York

You can send funds to a different wallet address, but please only use one phone number per person. If you use a Google Voice number or prepaid phone you will be required to scan an ID to prove that you aren't using several numbers to cheat limits.

It starts at 7%, but goes down for larger transactions or high volume traders.

Rent can be expensive for some of these high traffic locations, but we believe 7% is the highest someone should have to pay for that convenience.

The Bitcoin ATM is located in the Whitehall Terminal of the Staten Island Ferry. This is the only place you can buy bitcoin and see the Statue of Liberty at the same time! Now that feels like FREEDOM!!!

The plan is to offer small sell transactions with 0 confirmations, then anything higher would require 1 confirmation. We are also looking into the possibility of being able to send coins to the machine ahead of time, that way the cash will be ready for you when you get there.

Yes, we are one of the companies that filed for the BitLicense

We do not report any customer information for any amount purchased to any state or federal service. We simply need to enforce the daily limits and gather information for the larger transactions. Good question!

If you need coins fast, you can purchase with cash at one of our Bitcoin ATM locations in NY.

We have not been able to put up any marketing yet. We will have a standing banner in front of the store within the next couple weeks.

2-way Bitcoin ATMs typically require 1 confirmation on sell transactions, so that should only be about 10 minutes. Now, if you fail to send the coins to the machine without a miners fee, like the guys in the video, it will take forever (possibly 2 days) to get 1 confirmation on the blockchain. Always send a miners fee. Most wallet apps do this automatically.

In our defense, we are just a group of young entrepreneurs who have bootstrapped everything ourselves. Yes, it is very expensive to operate in the state of NY, but we are taking the risk because we see great potential here.
