@_date: 2018-01-17 16:12:29

BTC is life even if it is useless 
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:57:28

I hope ur joking
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:02:48
lmao real shit 
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:31:10
lol a credit card is not "MY MONEY" its actually the banks they are giving u a loan and they get to decide the terms and conditions, however, ur reasoning for the charges being blocked are correct. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:24:23
LMAO..people can't be inspired by Bitcoin tech and innovate further 
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:49:42
u would be surprised at the amount of fraud caused by people using credit cards to buy crypto. I work for a bank I have seen numerous incidents where people call in with Coinbase charges on their CC and they have no idea what Coinbase is lol. From my understanding a lot of banks have programed their fraud detection system to block charges from exchanges.

Facebook has value because it brings in millions if not billions of $ worth of revenue each year in the form of ad revenue
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:41:23
u sound dumb as hell. " always goes back up" LMAO 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:34:16
as of right now bitcoin is pretty useless...except for the "its a store of value" argument...which is dumb because personally I don't want to put my money into something this volite...its not a store of value if it can lose its value by 30% in days 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:43:48
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:14:07
LOL...every says oh only invest what you are willing to lose...reading this subreddit sounds like people have way to much riding on bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:37:25
Ok...Sheep now run along ur herd is leaving 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:30:42
Bitcoin vs Facebook is not even an argument. Bitcoin is useless. Facebook is gold to companies wanting to reach their audience 
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:26:44
thr is a lot fraud involving Coinbase...whr scammers use their service to commit fraud...because of that thr detection system blocks those charges as a precaution 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:53:24
Cex price is ridiculous

Thank you 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:25:33
y wouldn't they...why would someone want to take a chance with that much money? It could go down to 10 k tom 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:02:28
and how would these people no that was the peak they were expecting it to go higher..lol...best is to have very little skin in the game it makes it that much more interesting 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:17:10
Blockchain can be useful for many other things. BITCOIN is technically dead or atleast Bitcoin Core 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:53:35
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:09:55

@_date: 2017-12-25 20:17:32

@_date: 2017-12-20 02:21:17
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:54:29
most people on this reddit care less about making "society a freer place" from what I gather most people want to make $$$
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:39:39
Hold On 2 ur Damn Life 
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:15:06
lol cool story bro 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:02:18
Never trust your money with anyone.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:30:00
honestly a large majority of people care about the money no one really cares about the tech except a small subset of people
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:46:52
what about BCH?
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:34:36
amazing response... I'm thinking something along the same lines 
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:09:15
no they can't if transactions take hours to confirm
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:14:46

@_date: 2017-12-22 05:16:39

@_date: 2017-12-10 07:51:49
u sound like a customer from hell 
@_date: 2018-02-11 02:36:02
if only common sense was common these days 
@_date: 2018-02-11 02:16:32
Bitcoin supporters love to talk shit about banks... Y don't u try mailing Coinbase cash or something hahahahah...Is it legal??? People always forget banks are a business and from a security/risk stand points they get to call the shots 
@_date: 2018-02-11 05:03:08
$$$$ signs have blinded bitcoin supporters...these people could give a shit less about the technology or atleast 80% of the bandwagon that is on about bitcoin...its all about get rich quick 
@_date: 2018-02-11 02:35:32
I work for a bank if you call their customer service call center and try to have a three way call they will decline to take the call since its a "security" issue and we only talk to card holders over the phone lol. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 02:38:58
Perfect explanation 
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:11:48
@_date: 2018-02-11 02:34:16
Exactly I work for a bank as well and can agree...people in this reddit feel like banks are conspiring against Bitcoin users lol...not true banks also consider certain gaming transactions/lottery as quasi cash charges. In my opinion if you are using a credit card to buy an investment or w.e u wanna call bitcoin it makes sense that its a cash advance.
@_date: 2018-02-11 02:37:35
Only an idiot would go into debt using a CC to buy bitcoin if you can't pay for it with cash you should not be buying it...I don't care how big the gains are or how your going to pay it off in the next 2 or 3 months
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:45:02
lol ...OK only a fool would pay 50 k
@_date: 2018-02-11 02:40:22
I work for a bank. If people call and complain we will usually reverse the charge as a 1 time good will gesture. If you keep calling eventually they will decline the refund 
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:59:09
i know right 
@_date: 2018-03-15 11:54:54
lol no one wants this garbage 
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:56:57
At this point most banks are considering them cash advances which give no points or cash back
@_date: 2018-02-11 02:41:03
@_date: 2018-02-13 07:13:14
millionaires are smarter than that 
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:58:13
lol ok...delusional
