What is a real bitcoin wallet? any sites i can look this up from, youtube links?, articles anything?

But even with one request every 60 seconds, blockchain can't seem to handle it, it leads to double spends which then block all subsequent transactions by causing more double spends.
Blockchain.info rejected my api key request can anyone help me get an api key please.

How do i do this, i checked and even with the requests about 60 seconds apart this is still a problem. so making each user wait two minutes for each of their transactions is not really favorable considering it adds up.

That is not what is happening, the funds are definitely confirmed before i try to send, i believe again the issue is because multiple people put in a send request from thesame wallet within about thesame time which lead to this double spend.
I don't know if this is some kind of Api limitation thats caused by the fact that i do not have an API key but i applied for one and was rejected.
I need some real help with this please.

Does it sound to you like im asking for legal advise?

I clearly stated apart from users depositing bitcoin in my question... Maybe i should clarify, i'm wondering if they make deals with miners to provide them with more bitcoin because for instance if someone deposited say a hundred million dollars and the particular exchange didnt have that much bitcoin what would they do?

I actually run a bitcoin exchange in Ghana, Africa and we are gearing up to start trading litecoin.

The way i see it, it has to get worse to get better.

More than likely you wouldn't have lost any funds because they moved all funds from the addresses to a new address in your wallet before somehow removing the old addresses. But i re-used one of those old addresses from 2014 before realizing it was no longer a part of my wallet.

If your used addresses prior to 2017 have disappeared too please share.

Hi, you were right. I just checked, it was an archived imported address. I got it now. Thanks a lot. I've been going back and forth with blockchain support for days.
@_date: 2019-05-21 15:54:17
This makes sense. I believe they stopped using non-deterministic addresses or similar in 2017 and just disabled support for them recently. I wish others could check and show that their addresses prior to 2017 have disappeared too so that i can submit it to blockchain as proof.
