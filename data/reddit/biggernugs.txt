Multiple claims flowing across twitter right now, happening in real time. Not trying to troll, I really don't want to believe this either.  As soon as I can find more I'll post it.

Correct, they are based in Florida. According to their profile on Cryptostocks this is where they stand ATM in terms of certifications/licenses. 
- Register with FinCEN (Done) 
- Create a company AML program (Done - currently being reviewed by legal) 
- Open an MSB bank account. These are special bank accounts required for companies engaging in MSB activity. (In Process - Expected to be done within 30 days) 
- Have our financials audited by a 3rd party CPA (In process) 
- Meet minimum net worth requirements for state licensing (We currently meet this minimum for most states. There are a small number of states, such as California, that require a $500k minimum net worth - which we have not yet met) 
- File application in first state (Florida) - We are currently waiting on audited financials and final draft of the AML program before filing. 
- Once we have been approved in Florida, it will then be easier for us to follow with filing in the other states that require it. I believe in all there are 43 states that require licensing. If we raise enough capital, then we will be able to file all states concurrently.

Unless something has changed there in the last 9 months, no. I vacationed there this year and while booking in March I searched and found nothing. I actually cashed out BTC to pay for it since I couldn't find anything to accept it directly. 
Having said that the bitcoin landscape has changed dramatically since then so I would give it another look. I intend to do so myself in a few months for the upcoming year.

Pretty sure Mark Cuban was talking along those lines earlier this week. He's got no interest in investing in Bitcoin but he is interested in it's successor or a similar competing product. 
I think there's no denying Bitcoin has changed the fundamentals of money. Everyone's looking to bring their own platform to the table, it'll be interesting to see what comes of all this.
@_date: 2013-11-09 17:20:14
NO, those will read  differently from a traditional CC and come up as Debit in their system. I actually had one on my account up until last week when they changed their requirements for Instant verification. Although it is still allowed to be linked to my account it is not sufficient for that use. If your looking to buy instant your best bet is going with an exchange anyways. CampBX  looks to be one to watch when they open up their ACH deposits on the Nov. 21. Careful though as their customer service isn't exactly efficient and I'd expect some hiccups at the beginning. Hope this helps you a bit.
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:59:44
These people cash out little by little if at all.
A) They don't want any more unwanted attention by large transactions.
B) It'd be foolish to dump the whole lot and risk a sharp drop before the coins could be liquidated. 
They've gone this far, it's about maximizing profits now. Depending on the exchange 10,000+ coins dropped at once can cause a lot of chaos, not to mention 39k like what just happened at SMP.

Didn't Iceland fully cooperate with the US in the Silk Road investigation? Not that this is SR related, but it definitely is concerning if you are evaluating it from that standpoint. Privacy may be out the window if Uncle Sam comes knockin.

That's why the US gov't holding roughly 175k coins worries me. That's a ton of money to us but spare change to them. They can't outlaw BTC but they sure as hell can crash the market.
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:51:32
CampBX has also worked fine for me, that is when I'm willing to send a MO or check, wait anywhere from 3-5 days for it to arrive, and then hope there are no mistakes(like they can read my handwriting) as they do their best to promptly credit my account. Better yet, if I also wish to cash out I can cross my fingers and hope a similar process in reverse goes smooth. 
Hardly effective, but I guess it is a way.
@_date: 2013-12-22 20:03:12
I'm a frequent customer from there and have placed orders well over $1000. They are as legit as can be. I placed a large order on the morning of the crash back in April and had issues with the payment. I was on a mobile device and it didn't register. Needless to say there were some issues. I really thought they would cancel the order since by the time it was paid BTC was down 60%. After we got things sorted out they honored the order at the old price even though they lost big on it. I remember a gentleman named Zlatko keeping in constant contact and even Roger checked in on me to make sure I was happy. Order with no worries, they are an excellent company.
@_date: 2013-11-17 17:39:52
I put an order in when it was $232 and promptly cancelled having second thoughts. When I woke up the next morning it was $270 and I immediately bought at that price. I'm glad I didn't try to wait even longer. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:31:26
The main problem I see with articles like this is that they view Bitcoin as a finished product. No one really knows what the final value of BTC will really be or where it's place in the world economy will end up, or if it will have any at all. At this point it's all speculative. Sure the economy is growing but I'd have to believe the current prices are being driven more by traders than those looking to integrate it into their daily life. Hopefully that time will come but it's insane to view any currency from that point. 
People make money daily trading currencies, just those markets aren't as volatile as BTC is at the moment. As time passes I'd expect that to settle down. The biggest question is if BTC can survive that long. I sure hope so but only time will tell.

Apparently the address was linked by altoid himself in a Bitcointalk forum post. I guess it was bragging or stupidity, you make the call. From what I've read they believe it's linked to SR but are still searching for any vital info(keys) to actually confiscate it.

Keep an eye on BitcoinShop.US
They don't currently have it but neither does anyone else. Just another option I didn't see already listed.
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:37:43
Drop MtGox right now, they will do you no good if you are located in the US. If you are looking for a US based exchange Camp BX is probably you're best option. It's only an exchange so it doesn't have any of the business tools that Coinbase or BitPay can provide. 
I love this idea, do you have an online storefront? You should think about it if not. I'm currently looking for a hobby shop that sells sports cards &amp; memorabilia that accepts bitcoin. I'm sure there are others looking for just what you specialize in.
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:03:55
I went through this last night. After I cancelled my buy order it took about 5 hours for my BTC to post back to my account. This isn't the first time that's happened. Aside from being the shortest wait time it will also be the last time as I'm in the process of setting up wallets and moving all my cryptos out of Cryptsy. 
I really don't think they are trying to steal anyone's money, every time it's happened to me it's been straightened out. I think the problem is they are in over their head. They currently don't have the capability to handle the massive traffic being pushed to the site and it's causing mass problems in the system. Cryptsy has what, like 90+ different trading possibilities. The potential is there, unfortunately the execution is not.
 What good is a trading platform that doesn't post instantly, or 30 sec. lag tops? Don't know about you, but it's worthless to me. I like Cryptsy too, but until it's more stable I'll pass.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:01:20
Personally I've spent quite a lot of my bitcoins, and continue to do so. I've been spending them as long as I've had them although there weren't a ton of places to use them a year ago. Even now if I purchase more to spend I buy a little extra to put into savings. I have a wallet I keep my savings in and a wallet for spending. Sometimes I look at the 270+ bitcoin that have moved in and out of that wallet and think "why didn't I just save it?" Then I look at my savings and think it's not so bad, plus I feel like I'm helping the bitcoin economy by spending them. 
Point being that for every person who is hoarding them there is someone like me who is willing to spend them. Besides, there is no guarantee that the price will rise, even though that's been the trend. I bought a 50"LCD and A/V Receiver from bitcoinstore.com the day before the price crashed in April. They honored my order without question, one of the reasons I still shop there. 
Believe it or not at some point in time the price will drop, and those who are holding have to hope they call it right. If not, then what's the point of holding for gain? 
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:25:24
It creates a **thriving** black market, just like anything else in demand that they try to stop.
@_date: 2013-10-25 22:33:01
They are also attempting to acquire this wallet containing
111,114 BTC.
They believe it's tied to SR. Interesting note on a transaction dated 2/12/2013 that identifies the address of a Silk Road Tumbler. It's thought to be the wallet of "altoid" the alleged early alias of DPR.
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:07:49
 You have to ask yourself if you're comfortable losing that amount when making the decision on where to store and how secure it should be. Obviously no one wants to lose but depending on the amount the options could vary greatly.
@_date: 2013-12-29 19:01:41
No need, but thank you for confirming. With Iceland known to work behind the scenes with the US gov't I just thought it was an odd choice,  and one people should take note of.
@_date: 2013-11-20 02:07:52
Bitcoin is extremely young. Right now the price is being fueled by speculators and traders looking to invest, not so much by end users. As time passes and countries either embrace or kill it through regulations you can look for the price to stabilize. At that point it will become more practical for daily use. 
Right now I look at businesses that accept BTC as proof of concept. As Bitcoin matures the price will ultimately settle down. Even volatile days will be marked by small shifts, nothing like the swings you see now. It's at that time the early adopters of today will be the "Amazon's" of tomorrow. 
Basically that's just my vision, nobody knows for sure although the answer is getting closer every day. You have some legitimate concerns but remember you can never have great success without risk of great failure, and vice versa. Pick a side and follow it, but have no regrets.
@_date: 2013-11-08 21:24:00
Typical of a government official. Quite frankly there are a bunch of things the US gov't advises against us doing that most partake in anyways. Personally I've lost almost all faith in the US government and could give a shit about their rules and codes.  If they make it illegal it will create a black market for it here that will thrive like any other thing they've outlawed that people want. If they do accept and regulate  it then it will allow more exposure and usage. Either way you can't lose. Although I do respect your decision to get out now in fear of it getting too deep I will definitely keep putting my money where my mouth is.
@_date: 2013-12-02 00:24:17
If they can't regulate it to their liking then you can bet they will try to corrupt it. The coins are froze until the legal matters are finished so this won't happen overnight. They may not directly push it to an exchange, but if they liquidate it cheap to someone with the intention of selling on an exchange what's the difference? Again, I'm just floating a worst case scenario. But it is a bit concerning that one of the largest holders of this decentralized currency is the largest centralized bank itself.
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:38:57
Bitcoin, what Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:58:06
Along with ACH deposits they had been working on a new instant KYC verification. That also was delayed and I'm not even sure what's going on with that now. I always figured that one would be reliant upon the other, maybe that's the reason for the delay. Just my 2 mBTC and pure speculation as I have no real knowledge of the reason.
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:32:18
Not likely, to date these are the known addresses related to SR &amp; DPR

No doubt. I think he was tumbling coins in blocks of 2000. Not a lot of people with that many coins using that service at the same time. Not saying anyone can do it, but that made it pretty easy for an advanced user to follow the trail.

They are making so much more money with their current business plan. Act like an exchange without really being one while offering vendor services and other options. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 00:16:28
I think that's exactly it. A lot of us are looking at a drop in price as an opportunity to purchase more BTC.  Unless someone dumps a ton of coins at once I don't see a correction coming. Even that isn't likely as a seller would maximize profits by selling small chunks over time rather than dump everything at once and risk a crash before the coins could be liquidated. The price can't go up forever but right now with new buyers emerging daily, and those already invested ready to pounce,  there's not much room for it to go down.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:36:08
I'm actually encouraged by what I'm hearing. Not that they are rolling out the red carpet or anything like that, but they clearly seem willing to give it a chance. As long as they don't regulate the hell out of it all should be good. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 18:02:19
Thanks. That sounds similar to the volume I've done. I never had any issues with them and actually prefer them over other banks I've used. I guess I'll set up an account with another bank, then call them and directly confront them about the issue. If the answer is not what I like at least I'll be prepared to immediately transfer and close the account.  
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:33:49
Just out of curiosity were you doing a high volume of transactions? I use Metabank also and have had an account for 6+ years. I have it linked to Coinbase as well as a few other BTC exchanges/businesses and never had a problem. I've had a good bit of deposits and withdrawals linked to these businesses also.  Just trying to figure out if I should be expecting a similar problem.
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:45:40
I thought I saw two for sale on [the other day
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:14:15
Don't let it scare you away. There were tons of people second guessing the price at $700 and look at it now. Even if a correction were to occur it would still likely remain around $800. Just don't play with any money you can't afford to lose and you'll be fine.
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:52:54
I hope the price continues to decline until Wednesday, the next opportunity I have to buy more, and then it can go back up. Unfortunately I think that's too far away and it'll be on the upswing by then.
@_date: 2013-11-23 17:50:53
Pretty sure that's already happened, and they accept BTC. It's not posted on site yet but if you email them they will accept it. Mind you, I'm not here to debate who was first, best of luck to both businesses.
