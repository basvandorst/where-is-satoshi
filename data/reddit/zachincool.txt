I think we also need crypto to even be considered a real currency also. Many people who hold tremendous weight in financial markets still don't even see it as a real currency lol! Once that happens, we will be safer with more policy to protect us.

Thank you :)
So basically, the QR Code/12 Word phrase is the password to getting my Bitcoins on that wallet? How does that work? Doesn't that mean that there has to be my wallet in the cloud somewhere if I can do that on any device?
@_date: 2016-08-08 03:33:40
How does that work? What is the technology behind it? How do 12 words give access to my bitcoins?
@_date: 2016-08-07 16:43:13
Thank you

Now I know why everyone always insists on not keeping coin on exchanges.
@_date: 2018-01-14 00:27:53
Aren't a lot of banks doing this now?

Why does Coinbase comply with financial services laws if it's not a financial services company? Why does Coinbase link to our bank accounts if it's not a financial services company? I mean c'mon man...
@_date: 2018-05-13 19:51:37
Lol I don't follow your argument sorry.

Top 10 reasons crypto will be adopted by citizens of Bikini Bottom:
@_date: 2018-05-12 21:41:23
The fact that you think anonymity is the point of crypto makes me not even want to bother debating with you but I will anyway if you want. Anonymity was something that inspired Satoshi to create Bitcoin, but it's not the reason cryptocurrency exists. Most cryptos exist so that speculators like myself can trade them and make a shit load of money XD
Name a coin that's not a privacy coin that was invented solely for anonymity. Most cryptos don't even have a use case, except for smart contract coins. And the fact that you are so bothered by the fact that I believe Coinbase \(a regulated financial company\) should not allow money laundering by verifying identities makes you look like one of those crazy anarcho capitalist dudes...
@_date: 2018-05-12 20:43:59
Who said money laundering is done with cryptocurrency? Money laundering is more accessible when you can transfer large sums of value between places in an anonymous fashion. LocalBitcoins has provided that functionality in the past.
@_date: 2018-05-12 20:00:20
There is no such thing as a "crypto company". Businesses that buy, sell or exchange any financial product such as cryptocurrency have to comply with financial services laws. 
From the Coinbase website:
 Coinbase is also registered as a [Money Services Business]( with FinCEN.
Coinbase is required to comply with many financial services and consumer protection laws, including:
* The Bank Secrecy Act, which requires Coinbase to verify customer identities, maintain records of currency transactions for up to 5 years, and report certain transactions.
* The USA Patriot Act, which requires Coinbase to designate a compliance officer to ensure compliance with all applicable laws, create procedures and controls to ensure compliance, conduct training, and periodically review the compliance program.
* Most states’ money transmission laws and corresponding regulations

Wow, a financial services company making people verify their identity? Damn that's so crazy.

I think as long people hold, they will still make money after a bubble pops due to the real value crypto will create. They will only lose money if they panic and sell as they see price crash.

Great video, but at some point I feel we have to start to see through the statistics and "professional" opinions and realize that anything could happen, including death of Bitcoin or another coin taking  place. Who knows.
