Funds are on-boarded and off-boarded from the channel. Once in the payment channel, fees are paid out to the channel operator.
It is during this on and off boarding where transactions are confirmed into the blockchain that miners will collect their fee.

That, or they point and say, "both segwit and lightning network style solutions have yet to be proven in the wild" which is true, but is only so because Segregated Witness isn't on the mainnet and because payment channels are still relatively new technology.
Segregated Witness will enable Bitcoin to become the universal and base currency we all know it can be.

Energy will become cheap. Solar energy gets cheaper every year.

Yours does capture the concept quite well, though Datt was an excellent name imo.
Would you ever consider rebranding Yours as Datt?

It is better for the environment that we mine Bitcoin to secure transactions than it is to print physical bank notes and pay humans to transport them around in armored vehicles and all other associated costs to facilitate physical cash distribution.
As jimukgb mentions, mining precious metals costs resource. Once mined, they need to be transported physically, secured and insured, etc. The point I am trying to make is that distribution and security costs are not free.
In the long term, mining something like Bitcoin should have mostly no impact on the environment if you believe humanity invents cheaper renewable energy tech.

Digital money must be able to handle all transactions humans and machines may throw at it if it is to one day become a ubiquitous protocol. Anything less is less than universal.
