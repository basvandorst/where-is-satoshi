I don't get it. How is this significantly different from Silk Road, other than multisig?
@_date: 2014-07-14 02:38:54
Please do! I guess my main question is, why hasn't this been done before, or why didn't Silk Road just follow this model? And how do decentralized servers work?

I already said "other than multisig", if you read my original comment.

If it's not  then the only reason is because of people investing, or people who are willing to inconvenience themselves for the "greater good" of promoting bitcoin because they believe in it philosophically.
Any other purpose for using bitcoin besides one in which it's necessary to obfuscate the source and recipient of your funds is going to cost you more than simply paying for it in cash, due to the transaction fees involved in converting cash to bitcoin. I still haven't seen anyone offer a non-ridiculous fee, including LBC, that regular people can use. So any of those other purposes you would be better off paying cash, and people are simply using bitcoin for cultural signalling purposes or because it makes them feel good. Rather than rejecting or trying to distance themselves from the darknet, bitcoin enthusiasts need to wholeheartedly embrace it as the dawn of a new age that makes government and its prohibitions obsolete.

Right, but why didn't they attempt to invent that? P2P had been invented, so the concept wasn't that far away.

Yeah, I understood that. Thanks for your explanation. I still don't think you addressed why Silk Road didn't just do this since it's obviously a better idea and bitcoin did exist at the time, but perhaps I just didn't understand your explanation.

Stop trying to remove the political aspect of bitcoin.
The mainstream isn't going to "accept you" if you pretend taxation and  the prosecution of victimless crimes is okay, just stop trying.

Wow, I didn't expect everyone in this thread to understand or be up-to-date on all the details that the murder-for-hire charges were dropped and that this actually is a landmark case due to the defense's argument that bitcoin isn't money, but Jesus Christ.
I know that has already been hopelessly whitewashed by the beltway "taxation is OK" types who completely disregard the philosophical underpinnings of bitcoin and the whitepaper, but please at least do some research?

If you pay taxes on bitcoin, you don't understand what bitcoin is supposed to be about.

Take off your tinfoil hat, grownups are talking.

Is this market the first of its "decentralized" kind, or is it like the decentralized ones listed in the sidebar on If the answer to the first question is "no", why is this market significant?
@_date: 2014-07-15 13:06:27
What kind of local exchange are you referring to? I'd be very interested in this. 
@_date: 2014-11-27 19:04:01
Well, this is awkward. It'll get buried though.
@_date: 2014-08-23 14:09:11
Actually, it is, since the  use for bitcoin is darknet transactions.
And that's not a bad thing. I love the darknet.
The only problem is you beltway types who think sucking up to the establishment and pretending you don't buy drugs off the internet with it, or that taxation is somehow justified, will somehow advance bitcoin.
It won't. The principle is key.
Condemn taxation. Condemn prohibition.

Could you explain what he doesn't understand? It seems to me to be clear that a public ledger and moving outside the view of the NSA's databases are at odds with one another. Speaks volumes about the INTP virgin niceguy cuck userbase here that this sub would downvote a pretty clear observation yet upvote someone whose comment basically boils down to "neener neener I'm smarter than you".

This is desperately needed PR strategy. Too many on this sub are unfortunately apparently Asperger's sufferers or otherwise NT personality types.

Dude, the CEO of Coinbase offered to contact them for you, why the fuck didn't you follow up with him? Are you high or something and forgot about that?
@_date: 2015-02-08 22:40:25
Can someone please kindly explain to me why both Gemini and Coinbase are acting like they were the first regulated Bitcoin exchange, and then I also heard CoinSetter claim it was them? Who is right, and what is the difference between the 3? Not everyone has time to follow the facts all you people apparently know..

Chill out jimmie rustlers. I am staying impartial and open. I asked an open question. I appreciate everyone's responses.
