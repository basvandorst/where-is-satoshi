Yes, it might still be good. Maybe I should give it a chance. Just felt that the price asked for ad removal is over the top. 
@_date: 2016-04-25 12:41:11
50 euros to use this without ads for a year. No thanks. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:59:52
Let’s see how you’re feeling in a couple of years, if you can hodl. I’m guessing much better. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:27:04
In January 2012 a friend explained the concept of bitcoin to me. I considered investing, but not too seriously. Luckily, I started following the developments and invested in 2015, which turned out nicely. 
@_date: 2019-07-19 19:14:20
By far better development team, network effect, more hashpower, more decentralised. Bcash community also has used some scammy tactics.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:16:34
Sure, let’s forget about firepowder, paper money, printing press, compass and all that. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:09:51
A lot of demand. Limited supply. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:59:36
Welcome to the party. Remember to hodl. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:15:20
Yes, sure. Just make sure to transfer the recovery phrase safely. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:02:41
Dollar cost average. Buy some bitcoin regularly, like every two weeks despite the price. This way you don’t have to worry abouts ups and downs. 
@_date: 2015-12-24 12:01:56
10k BTC or USD? 
@_date: 2015-12-15 18:21:43
Cash out to diversify to other investments, such as stock. That's my plan. 
@_date: 2015-12-13 17:19:40
These coins would be pretty cool to hand out to your children at the right time: 
Physical items have their appeal, especially when gifted.
@_date: 2015-12-11 18:20:00
At some point the price might not come down like that anymore. There's been so much positive development lately, all the investment and some mainstream adoption, like the Ukrainian bank. Wishing you luck in any case. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 19:40:10
Bitcoin all the way!
@_date: 2016-03-10 22:02:08
Same here, not working. 
@_date: 2016-01-14 15:10:55
How many whole bitcoins did you pay for it? Anyway, it's awesome!
@_date: 2017-03-14 07:06:37
Or maybe keep both and see how it goes. That's my plan for now. 
@_date: 2019-03-06 18:09:46
Thanks, just installed it!
@_date: 2018-10-24 13:32:36
My thoughts exactly. The author steps out of his area of expertise too often in a cringe worthy way, especially when he’s angry about modern art. 
@_date: 2019-03-06 17:50:46
 Awesome! Which wallet do you recommend for iOS?
@_date: 2017-08-06 12:34:10
I think it would be wise to start using mBTC, as the order of magnitude of value is currently similar to USD and euro. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 14:47:26
I'm predicting 1200 to 1400 euros. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:11:03
You can still buy one more. Might not be possible after a while. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:20:14
Yes, and Bitcoin is getting increasingly important as a store of value. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 18:29:28
Thanks! :)
@_date: 2016-12-03 12:11:10
Congratulations! Consider hodling a few coins tho. 
@_date: 2016-11-03 13:46:55
You are unfortunately likely to lose your money in day trading. Better to buy even small amounts regularly and hodl. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 18:09:22
I love his Chinese influenced language. The message is really good too, despite a few questionable metaphors. What's the source?
@_date: 2016-11-18 22:59:24
The translation is just not accurate. Buddha devoted himself to guiding people to let go of suffering. That's what he's saying. 
@_date: 2016-12-13 20:36:42
Don't you think you should stress retard a little more to get the point across?
@_date: 2019-08-31 08:18:15
Both. Cost average  method is solid.
@_date: 2019-06-26 08:33:49
Yes, if you are ready to hodl for a few years.
@_date: 2019-08-31 15:56:00
Happy to hear you found the feedback helpful! Just buy what you can afford to lose at regular intervals, say 100 euros or whatever every month. Then just hold for a few years minimum, preferably longer. 
If bitcoin continues to be successful and grow, you will make good gains with this strategy. 
Just remember to take good care of your security: own your keys, memorize the word list and back up them offline.
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:23:35
You need industrial scale equipment to mine bitcoin, so you will most likely want to skip that. You could buy and hodl some bitcoin though.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:27:25
Matters only if you are trading. If you hodl, your investment will grow in the long term almost certainly. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:01:24
This will definitely make bitcoin more valuable - and without the hassle and trouble to split coins. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:19:02
Now that’s a patient hacker planning to hodl until the value hits one million dollars for that BTC. 
@_date: 2019-04-03 04:04:24
It’s still pretty good time to buy. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 14:01:01
I just read Antifragile by the same author. Creation and success of bitcoin has definitely been a black swan - nobody could really have predicted it and the impact has been notable. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:01:41
Yes, HODL for sure. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:48:22
Fundamentals are much better now. Like SegWit activated, Lightning incoming, legal status good in places like Japan, use case in Venezuela and so on. The growth  might stall for some time, but I doubt it will be like 2014. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 06:44:35
That's a good plan for sure. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:36:29
In the long term, we might be going to the moon. So invest now, if you can afford the risk. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 16:34:47
This will be easy. I hope you will not regret your decision too much during future bull runs. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:32:55
Your opportunity is right now. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:38:51
Maybe buy and not gamble but hodl?
@_date: 2017-05-12 17:40:25
Try asking the critical questions from an old person with memory issues and a long history of serious illness and medications documented on those databases. 
@_date: 2016-10-28 13:01:32
Doesn't matter when hodling. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 15:35:18
Buy some now and keep buying every week or month to average the cost. And hodl. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 12:22:02
Yes. So, buy more every week or month. Even just a little. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 19:16:16
Maybe you can make something more uplifting next :)
@_date: 2017-05-20 08:47:03
Awesome, thank you! :D
@_date: 2017-05-10 15:38:33
There would be some price increase, I think. In the end, it wouldn't matter that much either way, as institutions will find a way to invest in Bitcoin when it seems profitable. And maybe the biggest demand is not in the US anyway. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 09:57:51
Good plan! 
@_date: 2017-05-11 10:33:45
Most likely yes, buy and hodl. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 15:15:11
2902 USD
@_date: 2017-07-02 19:06:15
Ok. My guess is 2000 to 5000 USD.
@_date: 2017-05-09 20:03:43
Nah. Hodling my coins long term. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:04:56
I have the Ledger Nano. A tool for getting both coins is only provided for Nano S. How should I split my coins securely?
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:33:41
Nope. Too much demand for coins for such a crash. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 15:51:44
...and we're at an all time high again. Still hodling. 
@_date: 2016-07-06 16:03:07
Highly recommend Finland based Denarium: 
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:06:31
I'm hodling for sure. 
@_date: 2016-07-09 22:02:12
Awesome, man!
