Never invest with money you can't afford to lose. If bitcoin went to zero, could you pay this loan off no sweat? Think of all the possibilities in all situations, especially the ones where you fail big time.

hodl means to hold. Some guy spelt it wrong in a drunken post and it's a meme. Also, you shouldn't be taking payday loans out for anything. You are fucked unless it goes back up. And nobody knows what it'll do in a month.

There is no way to avoid missing out on all the best parts of our time. Just let it happen and do what you can.

I’m guessing time. If you have a private wallet you need to transfer the money between your personal and then the coinbase wallets, then you can sell it.

I thought 1 Satoshi was the smallest unit of btc?

I was wondering how that worked. When I buy btc on coinbase, how is my order processed? My order will likely never have a seller for that exact amount of btc. Would I buy a fraction of someones sell order?

Isn’t electricity a significant cost in mining? Making that cost zero would almost always make it worthwhile.

True, but wouldn't this create a kind of safety net? Governments cannot protect bitcoin from my understanding, but they can protect bitcoin "banks". Am I correct in this thinking?

Wouldn't that be like saying "bittorrent is now government property"? It's not possible, because it is a peer to peer system.

You are extrapolating event way beyond rationality. By your thinking, the UN would lead the world to a type 1 civilazation. But it didn't, there are too many unknown variables. Society is a chaotic system.
