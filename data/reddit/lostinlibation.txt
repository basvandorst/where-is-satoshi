Brilliant. Thank you for that link. I'll be using it often to correct people.

Zero problems - I've been using them for six months. I have an automatic buy that happens every-other week on payday. This past week's purchase was blocked due to "suspicious activity". I received an email telling me about it. 
I responded to the email and they were quick to write back. They went over my account, cleared it for purchasing, and locked in my buy at the price it should have been when it was initially placed. (Which was actually a worse price, but it's the thought that counts) 
Besides this hiccup, which was intended for my security anyway and went as well as anyone could ask, everything has been smooth and easy. I recommend them highly.

Look at the spreadsheet you've been keeping since you've been buying Bitcoin.

Hehe. Yeah you're right. "Here's something confusing that you know nothing about. Good luck!"

Postponed so the US government can finish covering their tracks?

I'm glad someone else is thinking this. It's still going to be cold storage for the majority of my coins. I'll probably keep very small amounts on an app for little purchases here or there...but the bulk stays under my own supervision. I trust nobody.

Late to the party - always the bridesmaid...

Hopefully tickets, concessions, souvenirs, and everything else will be able to be purchased using Bitcoin.

That's the direction I was leaning towards too. I even think the registry is too impersonal for my sister. I'm going to give her a toaster?...I think I can do better. Thanks for the input.

I sent something similar to my favorite local bar today.

Done. Let's flood them with requests. I'd gladly pay with Bitcoin if implemented.
