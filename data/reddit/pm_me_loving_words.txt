A 51% attack is not holding 51% of the coins.  It's harnessing 51% of the hashpower at that moment, which is a completely different scenario.

Some irrationally fear the "mark of the beast" if any new currency comes about.  Even though the properties of Bitcoin are pretty much the opposite of what that story requires.

So you have to give 1.2% of your bitcoin in taxes every year even if you don't spend any?

u/MagicalTux Why do you feel bitcoin is doomed?
@_date: 2018-04-03 01:46:58
I'm fine with bitcoin not bringing value to the US banking and money system.  In fact i feel that might be the whole point. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 04:01:20
I'm not sure what you mean by "its stock".  I agree that being easy to use will take time. It's still way early. Right now many would point to 2nd layers like lightning network as progress toward that.
But transacting is a tiny part of the big picture (for me).  I'm not considering conversion to USD as necessary.  For me its value is in excluding itself from central control.  You only need to trust mathematics, not any (human controlled) bank or government.
Yes exchanges can be controlled by outsiders, but the asset itself cannot.  You've probably heard "Not your keys, not your bitcoin".  Who has the keys for the USD in your bank account?
That might not matter so much right now.  But if recent financial crisis history repeats itself, trust could become more important for people that are looking for something better.  IMO.

What is the leap exactly?  Going to jail for extortion evasion?  It seems there are a few more steps involved before your leap is survivable.  You either aren't in the US (lucky you), or you don't hold and spend enough to be noticed by the IRS.

I consider taxes stealing because too much is funneled out through leaks in the systems.  If i don't pay anyway, said systems could easily gobble me up and shit me out.  That's how it works right now anyway. It's okay to offer a service which could help with avoiding becoming a system shit.

Just watched it live.  No crypto exchange ad.  More surprising though was that I did not yell at the TV at any point.

OTA here.  I agree with others who shared their summaries here.  They could have chose shrems story for ratings, or to highlight a negative or whatever. But it was truthful about how bitcoin works in a very basic way.
They visited a miner in iceland, talked to a fed stooge, and sensationalized how the pizzas somehow cost $800 million. I almost yelled "spend and replace" but didn't.
The fed talking head said (paraphrasing poorly here) that crypto can't offer the safety and security that she can, with insurance and reversals and crap.
They didn't explain how bitcoin differentiates from other "cryptocurrencies".  For a MSM show that a bunch of people watch, it seemed pretty unbiased to me.  I guess maybe they are a little further along than laughing at you, but not quite yet fighting you yet?
