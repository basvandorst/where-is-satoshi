you aren't, you're discussing it as gambling.  


An my point is to point out why your thinking/logic is wrong.


you can have your opinion, but the fact that it's an opinion does not mean it's automatically above criticism. Or that it's in any way valid.

Do I need to convince you of the idiocy of 1000000x returns from lottery too while am at it?

this is pure bullshit. Unless you're poor, no one has 90% of their investments as usd. they have it in assets. Which are mostly pegged to inflation. If you are poor enough to be 90% invested in usd, then you don't have investments, you have an emergency account. Speculating with that is idiotic.

**so are lotteries.** That doesn't make lotteries investments. No one is claiming they are nothing alike, but you can't understand the difference between the 2, you should just shut the fuck up altogether. 


no, my "problem" is that i understand what risk means. 


neither do I. Throw everything you have at bitcoin. I don't give a fuck. Just stop with the bullshit argument that you're making a rational investment decision against all rational logic and investment theory.  
you get the right to act like an idiot all you want, I get the right to called you out on your faulty logic and rampant ignorance.

except you're not. Your "contribution" is irrelevant. Comparing this with Bill gate's influence and impact on his own company is absurd. 


there is no outsized gains given the risks involved. Just like throwing all my money away into the lottery doesn't provide outsized gains. 
the fact that his decision opens up an opportunity for huge gains doesn't make it any less stupid of a decision. Throwing all my money into the lottery opens up such opportunities too. 
For every one person that made such a choice and profited, countless more were left in ruins. ALL of them thought their bet were solid. Thats why they made it in the same place. The whole point of the "don't put everything in a basket" rule is that there is no possible way for someone making the wrong bet to realize it's wrong, so you thinking something is good guarantees nothing. Given that known limitation, the right choice is always to doubt yourself and diversify. 
If you want to gamble, thats your prerogative. It's a free country. But don't act like it's not gambling.

or maybe it would be more coherent if it were a topic you actually knew something about. Just because you're too stupid to understand the difference between "investing" and "rolling a dice" doesn't mean there is none.
