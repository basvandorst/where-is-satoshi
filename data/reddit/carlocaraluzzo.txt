Bitcoin might easily become a dominant currency within the next 20 years but there are still many hurdles to overcome.

The lastest price plunge is nothing to panic about. New currencies need time to adjust and inexperience among crypto investors causes premature panics.

This is another attack on Bitcoin through taxes. The Bitlicense proposal in New York is the same.

I had a chance to dig into Walmarts policies. Most people do not know this but individual stores can be approached to start new programs. it is  much easier to take it store by store, especially in the larger cities like LA or NY, than corporate. If someone were to get in one store and show what Bitcoin can do for them it might encourage corporate to put it in all stores.

While I agree that it is a scam, Ponzi scheme is not what it is. The problem is that while you will make a profit it will be miniscule unless you invest tens of thousands of dollars for powerful hashing. The lowest price at Genesis makes you about $30 a year in profit. You can make more mining althcoins but still have to invest more. The scam is that these companies make it appear like a get rich quick scheme.

This can effectively kill Bitcoin in Nigeria and it is almost a guarantee that this law was sponsored by the banks. Basically it shuts out any form of payment that does not originate from the banks.

Guys, this deal by Hess  is one of the most irresponsible pieces of journalism I have ever seen. Coburn did not even agree with him. Please note that Coburn said that if the IRS accepts Bitcoin as payment for taxes it was Constitutionally currency. The IRS is clearly doing that.  While you cannot pay your taxes with Bitcoin, Bitcoin wages are taxable and since they considered property they can be levied for payment of taxes under the IRS regulations, which also consider regular bank accounts property.
I just finished an article on this for CoinTelegraph and it will go up soon. Ive got all the links you need in there.
Hess is an idiot. Good tech writer, but that is it.

No, use a debit card, not a  credit card. This is cash you have in the bank, Buy Bitcoin with it, then sell the Bitcoin, at a 20% markup on Brawker, for a gift card at that value. This gives you a 17% savings.

The circle will have to be broken eventually. This continuous loop just cannot be maintained. When you refinance your home you can save money but when the people who control the interest rates do it the system eventually breaks down.

They will not say how many because it might affect the results of the study about how it is being used. A lot of students who registered early already have their Bitcoins but the official start of the program will be next week.

This was actually predicted by Tone Vays at CoinTelegraph.
"The Long-Term view remains looking weak. Although it did not quite reach the US$340-350 zone, it came pretty close to it at US$353. The arrow is drawn pretty small because it feels like we need to come closer to US$340 in the near future before a healthy rebound, and in a situation where US$340 cannot hold the price up, a fall to April ’13 Bubble top at US$266 is certainly possible."
Tone also works as an analyst on Wall Street.

No, but Bitcoin is major competition for them, especially in an area with such a large number of remittances. They will do what they have to do to protect those billions of dollars. If you think about underestimating the banks think about all the bankers who did not go to jail after 2008, or at HSBC, Bitcoin is essentially an existential threat to the status quo. So as a realist I have to be aware that they have a big dog in the fight.

Every time I hear someone talk about Bitcoin being used by criminals it makes me sick. When i here it from the Bitcoin community though it pisses me off.
Look, I don't care what the asset is, whether it be fiat, Bitcoin, gems or precious metals, even stock certificates, criminals use it to hide value. The media, owned by the banks, have a vested interest stressing this while ignoring all the cases of fiat being used by the same people. When when you guys do it you are actually assisting the very people who want to either destroy or control Bitcoin.
how about we do this: Stop promoting the status quo. Stop doing their work for them. Every time they say Bitcoin is used by criminals, point out the 10,000 times fiat is used, gold is used, etc. STOP HELPING THEM!!

I think what you are missing is that Bitcoin is to cryptocurrencies what MSDOS was to Windows. Bitcoin opened the door with the blockchain but do you really think it is the best we can do?
Reddit is trying to do something nice for its followers, including you, and you are complaining.

It is being done AT MIT, not BY MIT. Id suggest reading the article first before commenting. Makes you look less silly.

taariqlewis I wrote the article. Before I did I actually spot with both the Bitcoin club and CCN. The Bitcoin Club said that while the study is not being sponsored by the school MIT has always been supportive of the clubs activities.

According to the promoter, Jon Holmquist, there were about 800 total.
@_date: 2014-11-09 03:41:35
My intention was not to harm Bitcoin or to turn MIT against either it or the Bitcoin Club. As I said earlier I spoke directly about the study and MIT with both the club and CNN.
Taariglewis, one thing you can be certain of. If MIT was not supportive of the idea the program would never have gotten off the ground. Could the title have been worded better? Maybe. But it was not intended to imply that MIT itself was issuing Bitcoin, any more than my article a few months ago about the COOP accepting Bitcoin was intended to imply the same thing.
Here is the thing: This article has been viewed more than 700 times in the last 10 or so hours and not one person, many of which were MIT students and maybe a few were staff, had a single problem with the title.
Believe me, I think doing this at universities is a great idea. There are others who are planning the same or similar programs and I will be supporting them as well.

I do not know that it has anything to do with his work as a journalist. But I thought it could be of interest since he is better known, at least in the Bitcoin community, for that work.

This is a crap post. Same thing with the blog. Josipie91 you say your not a lawyer and you should remember that when you write a headline like this. You are not a journalist either.
This legislation was passed way back in November and came into affect two weeks ago. This is NOT an attack on Bitcoin or virutal currencies, like the one in Australia, which certainly was.
When you buy online you are never anonymous. Everyone needs to get that through their head. When you use a credit card, debit card or even bank check, you are not anonymous. If you do any business that is not  done on a freaking street corner with Ben Franklins, you are subject to being traced. Either get over it or stop using the internet.
