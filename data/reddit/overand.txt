Obseving that there are cultural pressures around men and women that encourage men to speak up and encourage women to defer is not being a 'bigot.'
In studies, this is borne out - men talk more.  It's related to confidence, and it's related to gender roles.  And the phenomena of mansplaining is real - just because you don't *like* it doesn't mean it's not real.

It's been [discussed before]( and the landscape hasn't changed *too* much, I feel.  I'd rather have a 5870 or two (or maybe a 5850 as another poster commented) than a higher end card by far, especially given the current difficulty rating.

Owning a gun or a few guns is one thing.
"Stocking up on guns" is [something else entirely](
As for using guns to feed oneself - back in the 1800s and early 1900s, before large scale agriculture, we'd managed to decimate populations of local animals.  In most parts of the United States, there aren't nearly enough wild animals to support even a small portion of the population, were they to go out and hunt for their food.

I think it might be a bold move to set your prices like this:
(BasePrice + BitCoinUSDExchangeRate)/2
(Or similarly designed but with different 'weights') - figure a bitcoin price and a USD price, and actually use the average / combined - that way your price is both set by your "BTC price" and also affected by the USD/BTC fluctuations.

Or to be more specific - take a look a the [Mining Hardware Comparison]( - which shows hash rates per watt.  GPUs are dramatically faster - on the order of 50 times faster - and for far far less than 50 times the power.  A moderately priced video card using less than 500 watts mines at 313000khashes - with a mining time for a block of on-average 11 days.  So.

I love bitcoin, don't get me wrong.
But - at least as-of-yet, the bitcoin software space is certainly not at a place lining up with what Stallman is proposing here, namely:
"Press a button in your music player, give money to the artist."
* Getting money from your employer / income source into BTC
* Integrating 'target musician/recpient' knowledge and BTC support into multiple, widely-used music players (or at least plugins to do so)
* Getting BTC sent this way to actually get to the artist, into a form usable by them

I have to say - I find the concept of selling for BTC-but-just-at-the-exchange-rate-to-USD is a bit... hairy.
@_date: 2011-05-17 16:53:21
There is no immediate solution to this.
The hairy thing is that BTC is potentially more than just 'a way to send and receive USD via the internet." But, as long as we pin BTC value to USD in our transactions, the greater disruptive power of bitcoin - i.e. a currency uncoupled from, independent of other currencies - is lost.
Of course, with the current volatility, I can't expect anyone to want to use bitcoin in this way yet.  It's... shall we say a leap of faith?
(Much like bootstrapping any other currency was)

People can collect whatever they want.  Collecting things designed for killing other things is a bit strange to me, yes, but it's just a thing, so whatever.
Regardless, we're both going "ad-hominem" in our debate.  I have mixed feelings about guns much like I have mixed feelings about many tools.  Tools that make killing easier and more abstract are a bit disconcerting, though.
Guns - to me - feel a lot like buying a packaged steak or chicken breast in shrink wrap at a supermarket.  Not *as* bad, of course - you'll still get to see what you shot die - but generally at a distance - and a bit too easily in some cases, I think.

I said hash rates per cost.  The 5970 is more than twice the price of the 5870, but provides about double the hash rate.  So, if we're only talking about the price of the *card* - you're much better served by a 5870.
Even taking electricity into account, the MHash/watt price on the 5970 is really only marginally better than the 5870, so I'm going to have to continue to disagree.
I really don't understand the 5970 fetishism.  My 5870 was ~$200 and it's running about 357 MHash/sec, overclocked on the stock cooler with a spare casefan pointed at the intake.  $600 -  or 3x the price - for a card that does less than twice the hash rate just doesn't make sense.
Note - if you're going to do this - I HIGHLY suggest you learn to adjust the fan speed - mine was stuck at 33% of max by default, it cranks much better and cooler at 80 / 90.
On linux - aticonfig --pplib-cmd "set fanspeed 0 90"

Convenience.  If the bitcoin client doesn't have hot access to the wallet, you can't really receive finds.
Makes sense to have multiple wallets in this case.  But - in the end?  It's all about convenience vs. security.  The real answer is for the bitcoin client itself to support encryption of the wallet.dat file - that way, reading the file / stealing the file wont' really be that useful.

Choosing a Linux distribution, setting it up (securely), installing webmin, and then

NOT the same as "getting access to control panel, and uploading your site contents."
Listen, I get that a VPS is more flexible. But that doesn't mean that it's an appropriate solution for most people who want to host a website.
Most people in the US drive cars. I could spend an hour talking about how much more fuel efficient motorcycles are, and how much more fun they are to drive, and how they cause less traffic congestion, but that's not going to make them an appropriate replacement for the automobile.
