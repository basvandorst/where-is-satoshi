I’ll be happy to have my nuclear submarine.

buy high sell low? you’re better off relaxing and being patient for it to go back up or at least closer to your purchase price.

i want a whole one bitcoin so badly. At my current rate I will get there... never since prices will continue to rise. Only need to acquire 0.96 more to go though!
fuck it though, I’m having as much fun doing bitcoining as when I started gambling small money on the stock market. 
happy new year to everyonneeennne!!!!!

Just wanted to say merry christmas eve everyone!!! If you ever get too down about anything at all, just remember that this internet stranger loves and is very proud of you.

Just make sure you only use money that you can afford to lose and.... invest today!!! or set a limit order on gdax. Don’t feel rushed and if you do buy, don’t sell when it drops. 
Have a good one!!!!!! and good luck with everything you do.

I absolutely love the idea of having bitcoin and just keeping it for 10+ years to see what happens. The one thing that sucks is coming in so late is that I'll never be able to have an entire bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:48:48
that’s amazing! hell yes for both of them! Philanthropy in the age of bitcoin is going to be very interesting. 
Like everyone, I wish I had more bitcoin (2% of 1 club!!!) but I definitely assumed Andreas would have much more than he does.  I have a feeling he is going to get way more important in the coming year.

is this how it works? or did I just fuck my self somehow. 
Either say i hope everyone here has a fantastic weekend!!!

props and have fun out there! I’ll never understand why some people continue to work after they could retire, what was the point of everything if you don’t even get to enjoy what you’ve worked toward? I think this is sorta the same thing and I’m happy for you and your gf for making the decision to have some fun and do something that means a lot to you two. I would be lying if I said I wasn’t a little jealous. 
If I were you, I’d head to Japan and do some exploring! always wanted to roam around there.

what do you mean free bcash? I haven’t been up to speed on bcash and have just accepted this subs arguments that it sucks. but free stuff?? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:30:23
I’m fucking loving seeing the potential of philanthropy in the age of bitcoin and other cryptos. Props to you for being a leader in the movement towards it. I’d like to imagine I would do the same thing if I was in your position.

Anyone having problem with coinbase? I’ve been unable to get transactions to go through since 9k... all I want is .02 and it keeps getting reversed. totally sucks....
Just wondering if anyone else has hit this wall. First attempt was with bank account, second was with another bank account, and this time as with a credit card. I’ve talked to the bank and instructed them to approve requests from Coinbase but all I keep getting back from Coinbase is a reversal... it’s fustrating seeing the price to continue to climb and I only wanted my .02....
Any advice???? or experience with similar issues?? thanks is advance. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:24:40
I think inside jobs should freak out all large corporations or even governments who own or will own bitcoin. Just one or a small group could steal their crypto and almost never be found. No doubt this will become a huge issue in the coming years. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:33:43
merry xmas all!!!
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:59:18
just amazing! and so well deserved. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:40:44
I wish I had done secret santa again and got matched with you. ha. 
I hope every single person here has a fantastic christmas!!! 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:06:22
holy fuck that’s an amazing gift!! I’ve said it before but a whole bitcoin seems fucking awesome. Props to you for hooking up your daughter - she’ll be a millionaire before graduating college!
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:40:51
I dunno why, but having one whole bitcoin seems awesome. Only 0.98 more to acquire to get there!
I hope your situation works out, I’m confident that it will all work out just fine. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:30:17
all I wish is that I had more so I could actually use it as a currency rather than as an investment. soooo HODL by necessity!
Good luck everyone!!!! I wish each and every one of you the best. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:00:48
merry christmas everyone!!!! I hope you have a great day. Much love to each one of you and please know that I’m very proud of you. If you ever get down about anything, please shoot me a message. I can’t promise the worlds quickest or best response, but I can promise that I’m interested in you and your well-being.

long enough that I don’t check prices too often.
