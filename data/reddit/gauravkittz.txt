Many Indians hold a really large sum in cash or assets. I live in an area of Delhi where majority of medium size business owners live. I can assure you that not more than 20℅ hold money in bank accounts or have any credit cards. The reason is primarily tax evasion or to succeed in the world full of red tapes.
I've talked to few of them and everyone is excited for Bitcoin. Only problem currently for them is price volatility.

The coins which have already been mined should be OK to buy. Will the transaction be logged on both the ledgers? Are the miners for bitcoinXT and bitcoins different? Or the ledger itself is different? Or both are different?

How is it? Is there a transaction fee?

Very true. Asians (including Indians) know exactly how much a dollar is worth. Eg, in India when talking about a mc Donald burger, I would expect to pay 250-300 Indian rupees. I know how much 250-300 inr is worth.

In India, we have a lot of issue of Black Money (on which income tax is not paid).
Small business owners try to minimize their income tax by not showing it while filling. This money needs to be utilized for investment or expenditure, else its like a dead thing.
These owners have come up with an innovative way of using this black money. They form a group of trusted businessmen, who often know each other. Its called as a 'committee'.
The person running this 'committee' is usually the one who knows each member personally.
Everyone pools in money each month. eg Assuming there are 10 people in the 'committee', each one will decide to pool in 0.5 million rupees per month for 10 months. All this money is collected by the guy who is running the 'committee' and then there is a bid to who would like to borrow it all for the current month. The bid is done by stating the rate of interest. The person giving the best rate gets the money. He gets only the amount after deduction of interest. This deduction is distributed equally amongst all the members (well not really distributed but they have to pool in less money the next month). This process continues each month. If you are not interested in borrowing the loan, you pick it up in the last month. As you are paying less than 0.5 million each month (depending on the deduction). You finally get more than what you started with.
In this process, the defaulters are very very rare because 
1. you know almost everyone and often they work in the same community
2. The person running the committee, has a benefit that the second month he picks up all the money without any interest. In return, he bears the responsibility of a defaulter, if any.
A similar approach to locals dealing in bitcoin can be extremely beneficial, IMO

Hello from India. :)
I hope one day you and I use the same currency. I'm planning to buy my first bitcoins from localbitcoins in few days. You could use the same. There are many sellers of bitcoin at your place too.
Peace to you :)

In India I've been topping up my phone with bitcoins. I've already done this for my family

Remittance. Currently the options to send money to many countries are extremely expensive.

Many people. I live in a community full of it

There is a lot of black money in India. Even at local bitcoins you don't have the real picture. Recently a friend of mine bought 12 btc. He says that the person he bought them from only sells bitcoins in india. And he sells more than 5 btcs every day on an average.

It's pretty much already zero anonymity. Zebpay needs a pan card. Almost every exchange needs it these days (zebpay has taken over buysellbitcoin.in)
You can still buy bitcoins with cash using localbitcoins traders... That does keep it a bit more anonymous.

Wow just wow... India needs this service terribly.
Uber does not accept debit cards and many of us don't have credit cards - as an alternative uber accepts paytm (a centralized payment network in India).
People use cash a lot in India. Bitcoins bought in India are primarily bought in cash (black money). If service like this could be extended to other services (serious competitors) like ola... That would be awsm!!!
