What I did was sold my bitcoin from RH a bit at a time. When I sold X amount, I would immediately buy the same amount through Coinbase. Once the funds cleared RH and got to my bank, I would repeat the process. This means minimal loss and ultimately I backed up my actual coins on an external wallet.

You’ll lose a bit on fees...can’t remember exactly. I think it’s a percentage, but don’t quote me haha

No problem! While RH has perks, after awhile you realize you don’t actually own the bitcoin. And during large drops or gains, there were too many ‘down for maintenance’ issues. Now I actually have control over the BTC

Saw many places that accepted crypto throughout the city. First time I actually spent BTC in the real world.

I’ll second it.

Buy and then don’t check the charts for a month. If the media goes bananas about bitcoin breaking new highs, you’ll hear about it. 
Otherwise, don’t bother about it for a bit.

The price dropped by one large sale first, then there was the Coinbase crash.

Not everyone is saying that. Definitely a good chance it’ll go back down.

I was a math major and in 2009 our math club talked about bitcoin, but didn’t think it was worth our time. 
I still remember us sitting at the table researching it and thinking it wasn’t going to take off. Luckily wisened up. The only solace is that I, like many, would have used it as currency rather than saving it as an asset.

McAfee would love this chart.
