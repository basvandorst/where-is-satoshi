Using you bank analogy, imagine you have some stuff in a safe deposit box. The bank gets robbed and half the safe deposit boxes get stolen including yours. You want the bank to just say tough shit to you?

There is an almost 0% chance the hacker gives the coins back or even gets caught.

Their lawyer likely advised (rightfully so) that their TOS saying they didn't control customer funds would not hold up. So they did a 180 and accepted they control everything on the site. Silver lining I guess.

Not an exchange but "sheep" marketplace... I mean, cmon.

As with most controversies, it is either incompetence or conspiracy. Only time will tell.

It's gone dude just accept it.

It sounds like bitfinex had full control over BitGo withdraw limits and the hacker removed those limits. So basically bitfinex held all 3 keys and that's how the hacker did it (didn't need the 3rd cold storage key). Why the fuck bitfinex would undermine the entire purpose of BitGo's involvement  essentially turning everyone's wallet into a hot wallet is incredibly negligent.

I don't think you understand bitcoin. Do some research and Google coin tumbler and you'll answer your own questions.

I'm pretty sure that's their CEO lol
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:28:52
Seems to be the only hope to get my coins back at this point lol.
@_date: 2016-08-05 21:45:08
No, that's how silk road lasted for as long as it did and tracing coins didn't bring them or anyone else down.

Bitgo was probably only implemented for compliance reasons and compliance officers are generally retarded and signed off on it.

What you and everyone should do is withdraw everything and never touch their site again. What they are trying to do I probably illegal. Be happy you get anything at all.

What I gather from reading about this non-stop is that bitfinex controlled the withdraw limits, not BitGo, so the attacker basically removed the withdraw limit and sent the withdraw requests to BitGo who automatically signed them. Maybe this isn't what happened, but that appears to be the prevailing theory since Zane has said their cold wallet keys weren't compromised and neither was BitGo. Basically, BitGo served absolutely no purpose at all. Everyone had a hot wallet.

No kidding. That means they had about 350k BTC worth of assets. A lot of people must have just kept assets there without putting them in the orderbook or loaning them out.

You cannot know who owns what and how many addresses they control. Privacy is a huge selling point. I think you're confused. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:37:38
I'm not sure of the legality of it all but I don't understand why you think some people should get everything back and other users get nothing back. That's not fair at all since the particular accounts that got hacked didn't do anything to compromise their own accounts. It was just unlucky and lucky ones but we all shared the same system and that system got hacked.

What if they have say $20m on hand so when the token gets sold down 64% of its face value due to people just trying to GTFO they buy up all the tokens at a discount thus eliminating the debt?
@_date: 2016-06-06 17:36:43
This is the 2nd.

It 100% for sure is not. I trade there.

Those prudes at would just tell you to sell and buy some boring ass bonds anyways.

Just 2% so far?

They are the only place US people can legally trade futures. I know because I trade there and I had to do all the aml/kyc.

AFAIK, only CW is involved with the ATO. Why would all of these other people be helping him?

That fucking photo though! Lmao
@_date: 2016-05-05 18:14:53
But why? That's what I cannot figure out about all of this. What is everyone's motive for perpetuating this con?

@_date: 2016-07-20 17:27:29
Correct. He sounded like it already did this for older versions which is not true.
@_date: 2016-05-04 15:48:28
I believe that the forum was hacked at some point so it would not be good proof.

Addresses created after you backup you wallet are not included in the backup, so you could lose those coins in the new address if you don't back up your wallet again.
