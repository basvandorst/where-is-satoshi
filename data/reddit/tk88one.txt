why does it matter if the network is clogged? if you put in a transaction fee higher then others, your transaction will be included, thats the point... block size is fine, everything working fine. stress test proves that once no more btc to mine, the tx fees will be the main incentive. just like it should be...

why raise limit? isnt it good the limit is smaller to give incentive for miner fees to start becoming more effective?
smalelr blocks = better miner fees to include transaction in block = miners make more, which will be good...

love tails, free bits?

i think biggest problem would be less incentive to put fees for transactions, when all the bitcoins are mined, the incentive to verify and continue to contribute would be the miner fees,

dont raise the limit, that will cause miner profits to decrease, the lower the limit, the more ppl would pay for mining fees, the limit is there for a reason, leave everything as is, and let everything work itself out. if needed build around it... that would be best in my opinion.

cant you just say i lost them, and dont remember the brain wallet they are in? how can they take them away, if you claim you dont even have them, or say they got stolen!?
bitcoin is almost impossible to trace, i would think so atleast..
