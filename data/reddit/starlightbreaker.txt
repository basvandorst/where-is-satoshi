ah, 2011, a time where i mined 4-5 bitcoins an hour by poolhopping.
shit, i was excited when it reached $12.
@_date: 2014-02-04 02:38:46
one difference though, ltc and btc wasn't really designed to be totally mined in one year.
that infinite 10k was an accident.
@_date: 2014-10-10 13:32:20
Approximately...3 years? 
@_date: 2014-06-04 21:34:29
Hey now, they feel super rich by giving 3 pennies. 
At least it's better than the fraction of a penny tips that are being thrown around...lol
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:50:48
nobody claimed the bounty of the thin wallet yet.
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:15:45
Time to diversify. 
I hold zeta, nyan, pot, ltc, vert, fox, net and doge. 
If they flopped, oh well. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:20:11
Mined and bter.

@_date: 2014-10-16 04:12:49
you have so many haters...and now, look who's the last one laughing.
you should be the very first one to tell those people "i fuckin' told you so"
@_date: 2014-02-26 06:22:50
i know i did it just for shit and giggles.
@_date: 2014-01-20 06:06:05
dogecoin is based on bells.
hell, the first client still had reference to bells when you start it up.
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:07:30
ya think?
go there and tell me that most users in that sub know they have the "power" to do so.
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:49:32
Huh. 
Change "bitcoin" to "cash", and it still sounds the same. 
Let's ban "cash" too! 
@_date: 2014-02-09 06:23:29
hmm, smells like bullshit over here..
@_date: 2014-10-04 17:01:22
c'mon, we're talking about moolah.
you should know by the sheer amount of complaints and incompetency by them.
it's pretty much expected.
@_date: 2014-03-09 19:17:51
Wtf. 
Plaintext? 
That's amateur hour..and they handle millions of dollars. 
@_date: 2014-07-04 06:07:13
watching the charts go crazy is more fun than watching the paint dry.
...basically, a good way to kill some time.
@_date: 2014-02-04 01:41:13
It's easier to think that dogecoin is like "baby's first cryptocurrency" 
But then again, the people there are kinda like a cult. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 07:51:44
your enter button broken or something?
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:19:47
@_date: 2014-02-03 02:47:09
after i toss you that tip?
@_date: 2014-02-09 07:55:25
gee, i wonder brigading after so many times with no np link will get them banned or not.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:56:46
@_date: 2014-03-08 17:38:06
well, can't really buy anything with your asspennies anyway.
@_date: 2014-07-20 06:47:45


can i have that on a t-shirt?
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:51:53
they're only 2 months in, but there are proposals to change the very fundamental things of that coin.
changes can be good, as long as it's well calculated.
@_date: 2014-02-04 05:18:14
ah, good ol' dogehouse.
@_date: 2014-05-06 23:57:44
give it a year.
until then, milk it to death.
@_date: 2014-06-28 04:43:55
still the same, albeit more cult-y
@_date: 2014-03-04 04:25:01
I still have my college ID, but i graduated already.
i guess that doesn't work, huh?
@_date: 2014-01-20 04:35:55
ah, the name i haven't heard in a long time.
kinda wondering where's Artforz now.
@_date: 2014-02-04 05:27:26


enjoy your blockchain bloat lol.
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:37:33


for now.
i cant exactly tell how it's gonna be in a couple months from now.
@_date: 2014-02-04 02:36:56
and well, you can decide it yourself if you see the discussion on github.
@_date: 2014-07-07 17:57:39
you want people to see the full unedited video?
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:01:40
probably 23 cents tomorrow.
@_date: 2014-07-07 18:03:07
ok, then i'll get it uploaded somewhere, so people can judge for themselves.
@_date: 2014-02-05 07:24:56
it's all fun and games until one of them got banned.
@_date: 2014-01-20 05:44:52
haha, nice one.
i'd tip you, but it'll end up as a joke.
@_date: 2014-10-04 22:36:05
to be fair, there were warnings about them months already.
@_date: 2014-02-04 08:12:49


i guess you haven't been around long enough, lol
@_date: 2014-03-08 17:26:47


sooo, roughly around $.65?

it is.
but way less profitable now.
@_date: 2014-03-08 17:12:49
don't forget the chances that they're locked up somewhere and someone lost the key to release them.
@_date: 2014-04-04 05:27:32
...and should we care that you think this is disgusting?
@_date: 2014-01-16 01:55:13

@_date: 2014-02-04 06:48:55
you misspelled litecoin.

Sounds about right. 
Don't worry about those folk..not going to go for the latest or greatest things, unless they're gear whores.

change your unit to satoshi, then it's a good round number.


and with faster confirmation, you get so much orphan, you can open a block orphanage.
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:50:16
that's why i only keep a small number of altcoins here and there.
it's one click away.
...well, fine, a few clicks.

that's an interesting question.
unfortunately i don't have the answer for that.

maybe doable, but will totally takes too much time.
@_date: 2014-07-24 17:41:56
man, i had around 700 at one point, then i sold slowly to pay for my apartment, undergrad and grad school.
i miss the day where i can mine 6 btc daily. :(

imagine if BFL and mtgox partnered up.
the horror.
@_date: 2014-07-11 04:41:33


well, it's bfl
kinda expected, actually.
it's actually surprising if it wasn't scummy.
@_date: 2014-07-08 02:57:35
he's getting ready to run away, lol.
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:16:01
that'll be another significant change of the coin.
if they keep changing it, why should people trust that particular coin?
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:52:27
yeah, they're easily butthurt.
@_date: 2014-10-04 23:03:28
on dogecoin and this sub, there were so many complaints about their incompetency 
@_date: 2014-06-28 03:48:52


there ya go.
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:07:23
It's an echo chamber over there. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:12:08

What? 
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:03:26
Too much effort. 
I'll just do the pump and dump part lol
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:15:10
acting like a goddamn cult.
to the moon left and right, and having to the moon as the answer for everything.
can't really stand the circle jerk, and most of them can't really have a serious or interesting conversation, only a few bunch. 
i gave up on helping a long time ago, now i just do whatever.
@_date: 2014-07-08 03:19:11


@_date: 2014-02-04 08:56:48
wrong person to ask, lol.
@_date: 2014-03-17 20:20:38
Well, honestly one fork every month makes it look like a joke. 
3 months, 3 forks. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 05:28:17
and potcoin too.
...probably all altcoin bots.
@_date: 2014-02-04 05:31:57


try the whole reddit.
@_date: 2014-07-07 17:59:01
it's called "diversion tactic"

@_date: 2014-02-04 04:06:20
well, they're not exactly like the newbs there.
i give them that.
a majority of them, yeah.
a small chunk of people there are really knowledgeable though.
@_date: 2014-02-27 04:56:52

@_date: 2014-02-04 02:54:38
the devs claimed they don't have billions of dogecoins..but who knows, lel.

in a month, i made enough bitcoins to buy 2 cars.

@_date: 2014-02-04 05:11:49
why does transaction value matters much?
i mean, people were doing arbitrage back and forth all the time. hell, i moved 5mil around in an hour one time for trading.
and i have a pretty limited amount of money to play with.
@_date: 2014-03-17 19:29:27
Well, the link is there now, so the downvote brigade will be here shortly. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 16:29:55
if you started mining from the very first hour, you can get millions easy.
@_date: 2014-01-20 06:14:51
well, yeah, they're basically throwing pennies left and right.
@_date: 2014-01-20 05:36:54
there are better coins before resorting to dogecoin.
@_date: 2014-03-17 19:12:23
Because bitcoin isn't really based on reddit, unlike dogecoin. 
That, and they don't really gloat it.

it went down like the interview with words got butchered.
@_date: 2014-03-17 19:24:46
It's easy when you started mining since the first hour it went live. 
I had millions of that shitcoin, and made out like a bandit.

dat bubble
@_date: 2014-02-04 01:43:38
Well, technically the devs didn't change anything. 
It just happen to be coded that way, infinite money ~~hax~~ bug. 
Decided to leave the bug as a feature. 
There goes, 10k until forever. 
@_date: 2014-01-20 06:21:54


on the other hand, it's so easy making money off of them.
slight price swing will drive them crazy.
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:59:20

i kinda lost count, how many dogecoin threads we have over here this week so far?
5? 7?
on the other hand, you probably realize that you can't really have a serious conversation over there..and if you do, it has to be aligned to their rhetoric.
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:12:46
i can't really explain it eloquently.
faster block times generates more orphans. 
orphans reduce the overall efficiency of the network to validate transactions.
that, to make it really short.
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:20:36
800 and counting.
@_date: 2014-03-17 20:17:05
Wrecking balled the hell out at ~250 when people were buying in. 
Converted to btc, and used it to buy stuff that i kinda sorta needed. 
Cashed out a fraction and pay them credit card bills, yo. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 08:39:32
10k blocks per minute.
for a year.
@_date: 2014-05-06 17:45:35
It's a weird country. 
Most of the time, cash payment is still the preferred method, and a good chunk of people use debit/atm card instead of credit card. 
Plus, everyone over there probably have 2 or 3 cell phones at the same time...so there's a good potential for Bitcoin adoption...if it's done right. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 02:42:19
because most of them just don't understand.
of course they're just follow what is being told.
i got downvoted hard when i told the devs had too much power...but hey, i profited from that coin.
@_date: 2014-07-20 07:09:56
huh..guess i gotta get it elsewhere then.
@_date: 2014-02-09 09:54:46

back in the day, we poolhopped on prop pools for those sweet sweet coins.
4btc/day was pretty nice.

i didn't even flinch.
it was just a blip. 
@_date: 2019-06-30 20:44:44

oh well.
@_date: 2012-02-03 07:02:48
don't risk it. 
if you wanna do it, you need to use several fake identifications..but still, it's too much hassle.
i gave them 5 different documents, and still got rejected.
fuck paxum.

orangutan is freely translated as "forest man" in indonesian. "orang" for man or person, "utan" or "hutan" for forest.

buy more!
at this point, it's kinda like a weird addiction.
@_date: 2015-10-04 19:18:11
eh, i made roughly 20k from dogecoin at its peak.
but man, the work to get that much by doing late night arbitrage was crazy.
@_date: 2015-10-04 14:40:21
No, i used it all up,i still have 2 btc now lol
Paid my bills and rent, college tuition fees, traveled, and more. 
@_date: 2015-10-04 19:14:15
In a way, yes.
bitcoin saved my ass and i can survive as a broke ass college student because of that.
but y'know, if i sold all at the right timing, that'd be shitton of money lol.
hey, what can i do. It was a fun learning experience to say the least. 
kinda miss the day where i can do poolhopping and get at least 4 btc daily.
@_date: 2015-10-04 07:02:40

now it makes me sad to remember.

@_date: 2013-06-05 15:52:25
it's bfl we're talking about. total scumbags.
i guess they're trying to redeem themselves..but even then, i don't trust them with my bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:02:19
lol fontas.
@_date: 2013-06-05 19:28:53
if BFL shipped last Aug/Sept, yeah.
if BFL shipped last month...they're still scumbags.
money-sucking deceitful scumbags.
it still pisses me off that i paid btc to them instead of just letting it sit and make a shitton more $$$. fuckers refunded me in usd half year later. if i only knew.

then september

how is that my problem?
they promised a product, keep stretching the goal and lied to the customers and delivers it almost a year later, and still off of the targeted performance.
it would be better if they never lied at all..and boasting that they're better than avalon, has more experience, and so on, even though in reality they barely have it, aside from fpga they developed.
