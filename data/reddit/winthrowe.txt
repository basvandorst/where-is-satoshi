It is a place where things are bought and sold.  The things that are bought and sold are stocks that companies have issued, which are denominated in bitcoin, and optionally pay dividends in bitcoin.  It is open to the public, and has hosted the initial public offerings of a number of bitcoin companies.  
Bitcoin is still beta, if you want to live on the cutting edge, you can buy stock that pays bitcoin dividends, but if you want something that you can buy with etrade, you're going to have to wait.

Does a fund company have it's own orderbook with no one to fall back to? 




I was referring generally to the ecosystem surrounding it, but if you want to talk about the software specifically, IMO it's still beta until scripting features have had further security analysis and been enabled where warranted.


This is a company, with a business plan, which has issued shares to collect capital to fund their business.  Dividends as a portion of profit are paid to shareholders in the same currency that the initial capital was collected in.


This is not an extra layer for the exceedingly small set of companies who have raised funds directly in the bitcoin ecosystem.  Many of the funds listed have actually had their inital offering on the bitcointalk forums or elsewhere, and this just gives a more liquid trading environment.


It certainly does and at I'm not advocating investing in anything specific, but as far as I can tell they're the leader in trying to create a native bitcoin stock exchange with the closure of bitfunder and btct.co

And when you're selling something online, after you send your item, the 'customer' can charge back, and you're left without your inventory and without your payment.  It's two sides of the same coin of trust.


The idea is to start with 'cash' and build 'visa', 'paypal', etc. on top.  If you prefer not to send your bitcoin directly to the merchant as a 'cash' transaction, you can send it to 'visa' instead, they will charge a fee to provide consumer protection with the ability to chargeback.
There exists a proposed protocol to do two party escrow directly in the blockchain, without needing a separate 'visa'-like entity, but the work hasn't been finished.

I misread on the math; sorry about that.


The difference I see is in this case the network is no longer worthwhile to attack either.  In your scenario, it seems like an attacker wanting to disrupt the network can drive out profit seeking participants at a rate proportional to the amount they over-invest in the network, weakening it over time. Two competing attackers of considerable resources would lead to excessive inflation, rather than increased network security as with the current reward scheme.

He asked for a 'typical price' graph.  If there was no trade during the period, there can be no 'typical price'.

Empty candlesticks show properly on that type for example.  It clearly looks to be intentional.

It's volatile as hell because it's tiny, but accounting for that, bitcoin's history seems to be an alternation of periods of intense increased awareness (and resulting price bubbles), with periods of relative stability where incoming demand meets inflation from mining, resulting in a somewhat steady price.  I don't know what that force is, but it does seem to have some existence; what cause and if it's influence will diminish or grow I don't know.
I dislike your analogy;  I believe that the combination of traits exhibited by blockchain cryptocurrencies are different enough from previous economic instruments to be worth an evaluation in practice (is it even a currency? maybe a commodity, or maybe deserving of a separate category entirely?).  If they're found unworkable they can be modified or abandoned to start fresh, rather than silencing dissenters.
@_date: 2013-04-16 17:40:02


In and of itself it wouldn't.  The point is that it's easier to build a system that allows chargebacks on top of one that doesn't than the other way around.

That's always been part of the deal.  The gamble is that 'we' can stay ahead of 'them'.
The intention behind the reward system is to have the security provided through the free market; the resources required to secure the system should be proportional to the value of the system, thus the constant reward regardless of exchange rate.  
I agree that we're at a critical stage in bitcoin security right now; ASICs are something a hostile nation or corporation could develop and deploy somewhat easily, and we've gotten big enough to possibly get their notice in a bad way.

You're off by a factor of a thousand, although it's still a crazy price in my personal opinion. PETA was an example as asked of a company that IPOed there, nothing more.
AM1 AsicMiner shares actually do pay dividends, and have done so reliably, and ownership of the underlying share can be imported and exported, so you can come with btc and leave with direct ownership of shares so you can be paid directly by asicminer and havelock can go belly up without affecting you.
It's entirely possible they'll be prosecuted for running an unlicensed securities exchange, but calling it a scam is unfair.

I don't know if you've heard of what I like to call the 'bundle of flaws' theory.  It goes as such:
The only way we can think of to have property x (e.g. a short term stable rate of inflation/deflation) is with a trusted central authority.
Having a central trusted authority comes with certain flaws and limitations.
Having no central trusted authority comes with a different set of flaws and limitations.
The set of flaws inherent in a trusted central authority is a worse deal than the set of flaws inherent in having no central trusted authority.
Therefore we will forgo property x.
So I suppose an important question is whether you can get a reliable indicator for the actual growth of the economy without a trusted central authority, or does that inherently require a central authority?

Getting useful work and not breaking the properties that make PoW function are incompatible to the best of our knowlege, so it would be a significant breakthrough in applied cryptography, "isn't a trivial task" just doesn't do it justice.

This strikes me as potentially a fatal flaw: bitcoins aren't rewarded to the finder of the block merely as an arbitrary destination for minted currency; it's payment for the act of securing transactions in the distributed ledger.
If the reward ever goes to zero or negative, mining will stop, transaction processing will grind to a halt and the network will fall apart. This is why bitcoin has transaction fees, so after inflation reduces to a stable level, the free market can pay what it's worth to secure the network.
With the current reward scheme, the theory (as best I can figure) is that the costs and expenditures of network security balance, invariant of the btc/$ exchange rate.  This has seemed to be mostly the case, with the exchange rate correlated with the mining cost, barring bubbles.   
Perhaps this isn't the economically correct way to think of it, but I think being paid for securing the network is the fundamental backing source of value for a bitcoin (the value of the network is in question, hence the volatility when held against external measures), much as legal tender status is the basis of value of fiat currencies.

I recall hearing it was actually Hal Finney that mined block 12, but it doesn't say there and can't be bothered to find a source.

Not surprised.  The majority of the syrup production is bought and resold to a co-operative that stabilizes prices and such.  With the insulation from the market, the pressure to innovate would be reduced I presume.

Looking at [what I think the applicable gifting regulations are]( I think that it may be acceptable as an incidental gift of minimal value, but I understand if you don't want to open that can of worms.  
In any case, thanks for the great work Col. Hadfield in being a monumental influence in reviving the public's interest in space.

On the reputation/strength of their team?
Disclamer: I don't know who their team is and this isn't a recommendation.

This logarithmic scale, long time period graph is the only one that matters.  Anything else is just short term noise.

People often have preexisting security procedures for secret paper documents that can be reused.  Society has centuries of experience safeguarding and preserving paper, and I have electronic documents I've needed to format shift 4 times in 25 years as storage media comes and goes.
Personally I have both paper and digital copies of the same offline wallet.

It's not broken, there's just no data.  Nobody trades GBP on Gox, so the graph looks the same as localbitcoins or another market that sometimes goes hours without any trades.  Either look on a longer timescale or at another market besides GOXGBP.

It doesn't, afaict.  If we define 'everyone' as people who have heard of it, think that there might be something useful, and have capital and access to gamble entering the bitcoin ecosystem, then I think after several more media spotlights, bubbles, and speculator shakeouts, it will again find a value that matches the current inflation (approx 35%/yr at this instant according to a quick google) to the rate of growth of 'everyone'.
I hope I'm making some sense, I'm a computer person rather than an economist, but this seems a logical possibility to me.  Of course the possibility that it goes to virtually zero and stays there is perhaps more likely.  There are and will be competing cryptocurrencies that may be more useful to society in the long run; but I do think cryptocurrency will play a significant role over the next century.  Bitcoin is just my best bet currently.

another one to try: collect dividends from a bitcoin denominated stock.  
ASICMiner is traded on  and pays weekly.

I can't say I was involved in the dot.com bubble, but I think I have seen something similar to this graph somewhere before...
It will be nice to shake some speculators out and get back to building an economy for a new currency.

While this issue somewhat concerns me in the abstract, I really don't see any way around it without making bitcoin something completely different.  
Because of the impedance mismatch between the speed of moving fiat and bitcoin, and the less than bulletproof quality of the current exchanges, I think the community is just going to have to suffer the demand shocks, even if it delays full stability and adoption, or even drives the price near zero.
