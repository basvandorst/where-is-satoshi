You know he’s a kid when he buys LTC at a peak rather than a dip and expect profit...
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:43:49
you're one of the people that tell others not to buy at the current price without doing your own research, then when it goes up you go all silent, I had people telling me not to buy xrp at $0.70, but I did my own research rather than listen to them and it's up to $1.6, they have a lot going on and more things coming up that you don't even know about.

coinbase is prolly the easiest one to use, the only problem is that they charge some small fees that some people dont like, but you can also log on to gdax with your coinbase account and not get big fees, but gdax is a desktop site.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:21:01
You have to HODL no matter what
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:16:49
Please tell me 22.000 $ means $22.00 because if not you got scammed
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:52:19
it shouldnt really be a problem though because some people normally HODL 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:35:41
damn, I'm glad I didn't sell out like the rest of these guys, i was tempted to, but at the end I punched my gut and said HODL!
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:49:49
And why are you here
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:30:17
Most crypto currencies are a good investments, i dumped in ltc, btc, eth, and xrp
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:31:43
And the strategy is to buy at dips and hold for a longtime investment,  Coinbase isn’t good for day trading because of the fees but it’s decent for long term investments
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:07:45
I'm not going to let one guy influence the gains I'm going to be making in the future, HODL. You have to remember that this is an investment and not an instant way to make money, just because it dips down a little doesn't mean it will always stay down.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:28:29
Lol, I wanted to say week! But I said month because it seems more secure
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:02:41
Coinbase is having problems, look at their webpage
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:41:32
I've been using coinbase just for hodls and not for daily trading, works well for me and your cryptocurrency comes with insurance, only bad thing is you can't really do daily trading because of the fees but for hodls its good.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:42:25
i did some researching and already found out how to send btc to a wallet, the wallet is basically a bank account with no limits and sending it there would allow me to use my btc right?
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:14:27
People wanna make a profit, they see that LTC is cheap so they wanna take advantage, I sure did when it was $130
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:09:56
What are BTC futures btw and how does it affect BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:47:56
So at 6pm etc is the market supposed to dip then rise?
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:21:17
Idk if it’s from my location but the fees for Coinbase when I transfer money is only like 2.99 if I transfer $200, is that what everyone is complaining about?
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:56:20
I say put a lot in LTC, people have been doubting that just like they did with BTC, but I made profit within the last 3 days and it’s still rising
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:38:30
you bought at 17k? you must be relatively new to this... hopefully you'll understand 
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:53:32
I used bittrex, what do you use Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:39:40
Are you using Coinbase rn?
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:00:49
LTC has been on the rise, last Thursday it was at $100 per LTC, now it’s over $300 almost to $400 USD, I made some serious money for literally nothing, I wish I had taken it more seriously when it was at 100
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:41:20
DO IT! If it can manage to go below 10k i will buy it back up to 16k!
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:25:12
What is the best BTC and LTC wallet to get when you wanna get out of Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:38:14
It usually tells you about when it should be in there
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:09:57
LTC dips below $300 USD, taking advantage!!!
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:45:43
Must be new to bitcoin eh?
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:12:41
Look for yourself
Coinbase crashes right after my purchase went through, I feel like something is about to go down 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:02:12
so if youre right, would this be a buy and sell session?
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:03:02
is the market just going to plummet for btc or will it do the same for ltc?
because if ltc drops below 100 i might get on that
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:36:40
Is there supposed to be a surge tomorrow? And where do you guys get this info from?
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:42:01
That’s exactly how I was going to say it
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:23:47
i kept refreshing that's why, at the second it dipped i bought it, then it crashed after my payment went through, i guess others were doing the same thing.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:39:17
is this when the stock is supposed to go up?
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:13:22
So when will it be a good time to buy some more bitcoin? And when should I get more LTC too?
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:11:54
Even if that were to happen, it wouldn’t go below what I put in, I would prolly still make a profit
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:55:21
So basically what you are saying is pretend you didn’t have that other 25%? That might work if your investment was under $100, but if it was 10k I don’t think you would forget losing or pretend that you never lost 2.5k
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:00:57
Everyone is doing this for the profits, they see the rise, they join on
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:16:19
I bought some just in time
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:17:29
If you use your credit card, it transfers immediately, if you connected your bank account, it will take like a week or so to go through, but it still locks in at what you bought it for
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:31:11
BTC always goes crazy around night time here on the east coast
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:28:15
btc dip
it dipped for literally seconds
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:58:45
Now’s the time to buy lite coin, bought at $130 now it’s at $230 USD, made $100 for every $100 I put in there!
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:25:18
please sell so that we can get some more btc for cheap and wait for the price to sky rocket
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:58:59
Damn, I spent $1000 when it was just $1500 each, I guess I overpaid... �� 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:42:45
So when would be a good day to start buying some more BTC? Monday?
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:26:16
People want dips but when it happens they don’t want it anymore
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:16:15
Finally verified my ID on coinbase so I can use it on GDAX!
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:52:04
I would pay money for convenience 
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:48:37
Bitcoin has been doing decent, but is everyone going to hide the fact that LTC is on a good rise rn?
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:40:33
Invest in LTC, it’s been on the rise
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:15:50
I bought it at 299, that’s what it says for me
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:51:35
Wait for a dip, it might go down to 17k but that’s prolly the lowest, I’ve been keeping up all day and the highest it went was 18k but the lowest was 16.8k, just try to get it around 17k
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:37:11
Can someone explain to me why most of the crypto currencies are dropping? (I haven't been keeping up the past week)
Is it due to people selling their btc for Christmas cash or is there a bigger influence?
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:26:44
panic selling, they were hoping the price would go up but whales are making it go down so they are panic selling, JUST HODL!!!
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:33:55
To let you know what price you bought it at so you know your gain...
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:51:30
I kept telling people to buy but people kept doubting me, I bought at $130 and it has risen to $240 USD, I say buy but don’t spend all your money, save some Incase it dips
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:55:21
lol yeah i guess it does
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:10:13
People are scared of getting hacked or whatever but I feel like those chances are very slim but possible, people like to feel safe than sorry I guess
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:34:21
That's like asking what is the best phone to buy besides iPhones and Androids?
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:07:35
Buy it now, I hesitated to buy it on Thursday when it was at $100, now it’s at $200 but luckily I caught it at $150 in the rise.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:35:41
Start by the end of 2018
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:37:29
If you used a credit card the transaction is immediate, if you linked it directly to your bank account then you have to wait like a week for your bank to pass it through, but your BTC locks at what you bought it for
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:26:56
Coinbase’s document verification isn’t the best, I think it’s shut down for now while they get it sorted out, but, if you have your bank account connected you don’t really need it
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:15:07
Idc, i threw in half my spending limit now and waiting to see if will drop, if not then i have half in for the rise
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:19:36
investments arent for everyone 
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:43:11
give it at least a day or two, i did the same thing when gdax and bittrex werent so busy but now they kinda are so it might take a little longer
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:35:53
I’m hodling, yes I can make a profit, but I can see BTC headed to 20k by the end of this month
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:17:01
I have bitcoin on coinbase but I am wondering what a wallet is for bitcoin and why do I need one, how do I send my bitcoin there and if I send it there, will it be invested or just money to spend?
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:10:42
He’s talking about the dip, he sold whatever he had when it was high and bought at low
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:42:03
i think if you log in to gdax using your coinbase account the fees are smaller
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:31:12
*Great time to buy ten more bitcoins.
