I'd buy several bitcoins

Guys, help me out. I urgently need to buy BTC with a credit card. I usually purchase crypto for crypto on changelly, but for now, I need to do it with a credit card. Changelly has rather high fees for fiat&gt;crypto transactions, so I don't want to use it. No time for proper research. Any recommendations with lower fees and no KYC?

It's not about gambling   
Anyway, I bought just with higher fees

I've managed not to check Bitcoin's price the whole weekend, congrats me!

Why so?

The presented data doesn't say anything about the age. But I guess It's true about millennials; I buy some BTC monthly on changelly. I hope soon I can joint 1 BTC club.

1) October isn't over yet 
2) Don't focus on the price, bro

So BTC now is below $7,5K. I guess it's the time to buy some more BTC on Changelly?  
Finally, at this red market, I'll make some right decision :)   
Hope none of you are worrying!

So is it the end of the drop? Bitcoin is up 2% now

What are the greatest instant exchanges which do you use just to swap? Besides Changelly, ShapeShift, Coinswitch?
