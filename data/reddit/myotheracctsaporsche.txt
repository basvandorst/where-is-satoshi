I live in argentina, there are not THAT many localbitcoiners, and specially very few with the type of payment method I need for reasons.
Edit: no millionaire here, It's just the bitcoin market here is rather small.

I don't... completely.
But the other option is to move larger chunks of my coins to localbitcoins and sell in small pieces as I can, probably weeks, and by then the price might be much lower, thus making the whole thing pointless (It won't be enough to cancel my debt).
To be clear, It's not that I feel like bitcoin is worthless and want to cash out, I would be happy to hold through any corrections like I did in the past, just this time I need the money.

So... if I had 1 coin and bitcoin is hard-forked, do I have a coin in each fork? Can I sell them independently? How do I know which fork I'm working with?
Sorry if this are all very dumb questions!

Your explanation was amazing! Thank you.
Quick follow up: If I sold all my bitcoins on february, does it mean I may have bitcoin cash somewhere? (I read that the form date was august 1st)
If so, how could I access that?

Thanks again, all clear now!

The opposed to having bitcoin in an exchange (like a bank having customers funds and keeping track of how much is yours) would be having your own private/public keys (equivalent to actually having the cash in your hand).
I assume in the case of the mentioned things it makes a bigger difference, but honestly, i came to this subreddit to find out what those things are myself.

Could you point me to an eli5 on those things? I would like to understand how those things affect me.

Honestly, I just decided to browse the bitcoin reddit because I don't understand precisely those things.
I wanted to see what is affecting me, for better or worse... could you point me to an eli5?
