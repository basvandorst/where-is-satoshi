What side are you on
@_date: 2019-11-12 09:10:44
“Personal info”
@_date: 2019-11-10 15:47:04
Well of course not many people are that stupid. What odds are you offering though?
@_date: 2019-11-23 15:57:17
This hasn’t aged well...
@_date: 2019-11-12 01:40:30
Just wait and see what happens. Don’t deposit any money or anything or give personal info. The worst that can happen is lost time

What’s there to laugh at? He never said it would continue. He stated a fact and even indirectly told you to sell when he said spend your money

You might be an idiot. 20k ingested right before the recession vs 20k invested over the time of the recession thus having a lower average cost would yield more. Be gone

What makes you think it’ll be worse than 2008?
@_date: 2019-10-09 16:37:03
Not very conventional and Doesn’t really work well with smaller price movements. But definitely instant on big price movements
@_date: 2019-10-25 09:43:58
Terrible answer

Probably not what you’re looking for but I used to use the bitmexrekt bot on twitter. Would just set notification alerts for them and it was almost instant. The thing with bitcoin though is when it moves, it moves fast

I’ll stick with the advice of the likes of Buffet and Graham. Thanks
@_date: 2019-10-09 15:09:48
Well thank god in 2007 I didn’t invest all my money at once and I had a lot liquid to invest during the recession at much lower prices thus minimizing my losses. Think about it. Don’t ever invest ALL your money you have at once. Always have some to sit on to average down if you need to.

If you think the economy boomed from 2007-2009 you need to re-evaluate the market
@_date: 2019-10-09 16:17:59
Has nothing to do with investing strategy? There’s plenty of things they didn’t like that succeeded and plenty they liked that failed. Your point is not relevant

If ETH keeps up with the growth of btc then yes. But if ETH’s value falls against BTC’s then no. 
Also take into account increasing supply
@_date: 2019-10-09 16:21:21
Did they say you shouldn’t? You’re arguments are weak. I’m off this
@_date: 2019-10-09 14:16:53
Always dollar cost average. Never spend all your money at once
@_date: 2019-10-09 15:58:47
Well you didn’t PROVE your point either. There’s 2 sides, both situational. It can be good to do either as long as you have a sound plan and take emotions out of it. No one knows 100% what will happen. In this situation I could be right or you could be right there’s no way to predict. But to say it’s “bad advice” doesn’t make sense.
@_date: 2019-10-09 15:22:58
And? Investing is not an always right method kind of thing. It’s about taking emotions out and having a sound plan. I could be right and you could be right. In the end it doesn’t matter because no one can predict what is right 100% of the time.
