Thanks guys, it's been pretty educational

1. Even in the situation of  4,294,967,295 hashes it won't actually take 4,294,967,295 hashes to figure out the answer right?  All I actually need to do is figure out an answer that matches the target difficulty.  If so, it shouldn't take but a few seconds for a mining pool like antpool to find the answer right?  Unfortunately I'm purely arguing with my gut feeling at this point.  Hashing a values doesn't take hardly any time so it seems like a mining pool could figure this out very quickly.   
2. So you're saying that 4,294,967,295 hashes won't necessarily solve the problem and there's an overflow bit for if this is the case? (e.g. it extends the nonce value to 33 bits)  Doesn't that basically just double the number of hashes potentially needed to solve the proof-of-work?
3. If I understand your answer, you're saying that I don't have to update this time stamp?  If I started hashing the value at 11/03/2018 10:10PM I just wouldn't change this time until I found the correct hash?  If this is the case, why include this in the hash function at all?  Is this value required to come after the timestamp of the previous block?  What if I claimed to have mined the block ten years in the future?  Would it get rejected?

I heard Charlie Lee say once that if a block hasn't been mined in 5 minutes the expected time until the next block is mined is still 10 minutes.  The more I read into how the hashing works the more I think I understand what he was saying.
