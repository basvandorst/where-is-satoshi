Sure, but not the way you phrased it.

Not in the wild west it didn't

How would you describe the value of something except by comparison to a familiar measure of value?


As long as the loaner ends up with more BTC than they started with, they're still making money they wouldn't have otherwise. What would keep them from making loans in BTC?

Close. It pertains to any material nonpublic information. It could be something about the company or it could be any other information which will effect the market once it becomes public information.

Capital gains isn't about money in -&gt; money out like that. You purchased some number of an asset at a price, and you're selling at a greater price. The difference in price times the quantity sold is the realized gain.

Is there a barbershop competition?

If the value is constantly rising and I am a seller of goods, I *do* want to accept it as payment. The amount I was paid will effectively retroactively increase. I would even be inclined to offer a slight discount for paying with an appreciating currency to encourage people to do so

Er, no. The material nonpublic information allows a person to anticipate how it will affect the value of the shares when it becomes public knowledge, which may be an increase in value or a decrease.


This is also not true. Most shares are bought on the secondary market, not from the company. There would be no contract between the secondary buyer and the company. And if you try to stipulate in the contact that those who buy your shares sell on the condition that the buyer enter into this contract, you're not actually guaranteeing that will happen. A shareholder who sells without doing that would still have sold their share, the company would just be able to seek civil damages for breach of contract. Assuming such a contract is even valid in the first place.

Yes duh. You're missing my point. The shares aren't worth more because you hold the information. Are you capable of having a coherent conversation?
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:37:30
Yes, that would be true. But not the thing I was responding to. It's not an issue for sellers, but buyers.

But there does continue to be an influx of coins.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:05:37
The coins you obtained by mining were income in the year you mined them, and your cost basis is the value they held at the time you obtained them.
If you want to reduce your capital gains legally, you'll need to realize some capital losses at the same time; you'll only be taxed on the difference. Pretty much anything else is illegal.

The IRS is overworked just processing taxes. They don't give advice. There's private industry for that
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:33:56
I don't see how this connects to what I was responding to, the claim that shares are worth more to you if you hold material nonpublic information. They're not. You merely have the ability to anticipate how the public will value them once that information becomes public.

If it's unstable in an upward trend, I'd be happy to accept it as payment, but nobody would want to part with it.
