Bitcoin will not be replaced by 2.0 or some new coin with many new features. When you have lot of money on your hands, you go for security and trust. People will stick to the old tested bitcoin system, which for over 5 years now has been attacked constantly and never been hacked. New coins with new features may be flawed and therefore provide new ways for an angel of attack.

I hope one day, when bad news from China comes out, the price goes up. That would stop the china pump &amp; dump scheme.

If Benjamin invented a free energy fission reactor, he would right out ban it in protection of the coal industry.

My guess will be no more than 100$ per year for sharing a 4Tb harddisk. (If your are lucky) 
Storage is cheap and most people do not care about securing files with encryption.

If the price drops like a stone because the blocks are full and fees spikes, the miners will jump ship (Core) and go to Classic!

If paying from a single address, it would make sense to create all payments at once, but done as a chain of transactions, dependent on the last one, added with a nLockTime incremented with a number of blocks or time. You cannot publish all of them once, because they are not guaranteed to be kept in memory for that long. Therefore each "payment" transaction has to be stored somewhere else until time is up for publish. 
The point is that you only need to "sign" the payments once in the beginning and then hand the payment transactions over to someone else to be publish when time is up.
I currently do not know if any wallet that have this feature, but I think it should be possible to implement.
