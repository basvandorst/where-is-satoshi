Hello 12mgray, surely it should be reined in, not reigned in? It's reins as in the reins you use to control your horse, and reining in means bringing something under control?
 Reigning is what the Queen of England does, it's about fulfilling a ceremonial role, not actually making decisions and controlling things.

seriously, it cannot be clearer
"The government and therefore Parliament has kept to itself the power to approve Quantitative Easing programmes."
I mean, John Redwood, Chairman of the Conservative  Economic Affairs Committee (that's the Conservative party, currently forming the UK government) writes a piece titled "The Bank of England is not independent", saying "Any so called independent power the Bank enjoys it does so only for as long as it pleases Parliament."
 You claim the UK government are not the ones doing, responsible for, QE, but "...The government and therefore Parliament has kept to itself the power to approve Quantitative Easing programmes..." wins out over your riposte of "free from day-to-day political influence."
 And here in the UK, those who think QE is massively damaging, they blame the government, this is why I had that position in the first place, and looking into the facts only confirms it. 
Even earlier when you said this about QE


I am extremely sceptical of this. They sidestep the legal side of it, but if the market principles really did apply, then there would be no need to intervene with QE in the first place?
And, your link, from the BoE website does not give *complete* information, as an example it does not mention "Mr Darling overrode the MPC rightly during the banking crash and forced them to cut interest rates more quickly than they were planning" (from the article by John Redwood). So, when the BoE say they set interest rates, that is the simple, generally correct , short and concise version, but it does not mention that the government can override them.


no, you said I was totally wrong to claim the government printed money, that I had failed eco 101 , and why should you have to explain the basics, but **now** you say it's a border case?

@_date: 2018-09-04 19:35:18


ok, let's try again, this is by John Redwood, Member of Parliament ...
"In practice the Bank has to accept the instructions and judgements of the government. All the time the government commands a reliable Parliamentary majority the Bank accepts the guidance and views of the Chancellor."
"The government and therefore Parliament has kept to itself the power to approve Quantitative Easing programmes. This is a crucial power to reserve at a time of near zero interest rates. It means that even the devolved independence of the Bank on interest rate setting is constitutionally very constrained, as QE is clearly the major feature of current monetary policy. "

you changed from saying the bank is independent to saying it's a border case, but it's not even a border case. You were just trying to admit you were wrong.


no it doesn't. However hard it is to print money, they are doing it and, in my opinion, they are printing too much. Once the decision is made (however 'difficult' that may be), then how on earth is the 'difficulty' of printing money increased?
 You're not only getting facts wrong, but your whole thinking process is wrong. Either that or you're just flailing for words, putting together nonsensical sentences hoping I'll somehow agree with you?

yeah, I was thinking perhaps someone might have an unusual insight about what would happen. For instance, this thread is claiming that some exchanges are making bitcoin available to shorters (without the permission of the people whose accounts the bitcoin belongs too), so for instance, perhaps we would see a surge in volume on just a few exchanges and know that they, and only they, are the ones doing this? Maybe there's a specific reason why that wouldn't happen, which I'm overlooking and someone would point out, or maybe there's other interesting side effects, so I was just asking, that's all.
I remember reading this post a while ago
where the author says bitfinex "... displayed orders from other exchanges as their own, as if it was their own order book" - so what would happen in this case, if it's still going on?

I don't think the creators scheme care about the investors, I think it is more that **legally** they have to structure it differently if it is open to everyone, and if it is only open to accredited investors, they can be more lax about how the scheme works, so the constraint comes from the government regulator, not from the scheme creator, *i think*.

Not just conjecture. I think more and more people are realising that Bitcoin is the only easily transferable hard money, and this is why it will succeed, the more so as more and more people come to the same conclusion.
 By easily transferable hard money, I mean: gold or diamonds could be considered hard money, something difficult to produce and therefore quite rare (as opposed to just printing more fiat money), but if I have a single diamond or a few diamonds, and I want to pay for something small, it's difficult to divide it up, and for the receiver to check if this small quantity he's received is the correct weight (like, is it 1.234 grams or 1.236 grams?), whereas bitcoin doesn't have that problem.
 So it's not just conjecture, we think bitcoin has the technical properties it needs and that nothing else has, so that the rest of the world will slowly come round to our way of thinking.
 This is not 100% certain but every hodler thinks the probability high enough to make it worth buying.

i get your point, but how about in this instance? If I live in the UK and go on holiday to the usa - maybe the cost of converting gbp to usd is 5%, so i would prefer to pay directly in bitcoin if i can, and then later i can replenish my bitcoin wallet with gbp, at less than a 5% cost. In other words, it's either a choice of gbp to usd or gbp to bitcoin, and the commission / fees might be less via bitcoin.
 so, if this is true, which merchants might benefit a lot from offering a bitcoin option ? anyone in a tourism city - hotels, restaurants, shops at airports etc, any shop in a city like barcelona or singapore, etc.
i think this is valid, quite happy to have any mistakes pointed out.

I don't think so, I think hike is another word for increase, no subterfuge going on at all.
Looking in the dictionary, hike is defined as
1A long walk or walking tour.
‘a five-mile hike across rough terrain’
1.1informal A long distance.
‘it's such a hike from Adelaide to Perth’
2A sharp increase, especially in price.
‘a price hike’
‘fears of a hike in interest rates’
so it looks like hike has the 'flavour' of a **sharp** increase, not just any old increase

Asset Purchase Facility (APF) ceiling is... well a ceiling the BoE CAN max out. 
"The Bank of England’s purchases of gilts under its quantitative easing (QE) programme are undertaken by its subsidiary, the Asset Purchase Facility (APF)."
The obr [Office for Budget Responsibility] is another official government body; so those letters between the chancellor and governor, about the apf is referring to QE, and the governor has to ask the chancellor for authorisation - ok?
"Chancellor George Osborne has been using quantitative easing since the took office (continuing a policy begun by his predecessor in the Labour government)"
"George Osborne expanded the QE scheme in 2012. When the new government come in in 2010 the amount of QE money that the Bank of England had spent buying gilts was just under £200bn. Since then **George Osborne has instructed the Bank of England to increase QE money by another £175bn and used it to buy newly issued gilts to finance the deficit.**"

the use (in europe) of arabic numerals (the digits 0,1,2,etc) with a decimal point to express non-integer amounts is relatively recent (middle ages?), so before that people could only conveniently talk about fractions like 1/2, 5/6,  and so on. In this case, a number like 12, which is easily divisble by 2, 3, 4 and 6 is more convenient. 
 The same principle is behind having 360 degrees in a circle, 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in a day, because these numbers factorise easily.
 The ancient Babylonians, one of the pioneers of mathematics in human history, based their number system on 60 instead of 10, because 60 is so easily divisible by so many numbers.

I did not say it was not credible, what I pointed out was it was not the fully detailed description. Can't you see that?


The probability of QE happening is not the issue, it has never been the issue, you keep on introducing new concepts. The issue is, you said the bank is independent but now you admit the government has a veto and has to greenlight QE - you see, you are wrong. There is nothing 'wrong' with making mistakes, making mistakes does not make you a bad person.
 I have the feeling you're not a native english speaker, in which case, surely when you learnt english you made mistakes along the way, and so what? You just get corrected and you get better. But where you are now, you're refusing to accept a correction, to accept reality. Again, don't you want to learn new things?

more or less, I think it's like this:
you have unregulated investment schemes, and some may be hyper risky, and your typical man-in-the-street may be 'tricked' into investing in some wild scheme.
 To protect the man in the street, these unregulated schemes are only open to people 'who know what they're doing', financially sophisticated people, and 'high net worth' is used as a rough and ready rule to say who is financially savvy enough to invest in these unregulated schemes.
"An accredited or sophisticated investor is an investor with a special status under financial regulation laws.
 Generally, accredited investors include high-net-worth individuals, banks, financial institutions and other large corporations, who have access to complex and higher-risk investments such as venture capital, hedge funds and angel investments. 
Laws may require that some types of financial offerings may only be made to accredited investors."

I believe a member of parliament, writing about parliament, more than I believe you, and especially John Redwood, that MP in particular is renowned for his intellect.


are you just ignoring this? 
and then there's these:
"The policy of quantitative easing required Treasury approval, and a Treasury guarantee against losses that might be sustained by the bank as a result. Other schemes, such as Funding for Lending, which finances bank loans for small businesses with government backing, have been joint with the Treasury too."
"The Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee is expected to act on Thursday, as soon as it is given a final green light from Alistair Darling to begin the so-called quantitative easing.
The go-ahead from the Chancellor is expected imminently, as early as tomorrow, in a letter to Mervyn King, the Bank’s Governor"


You're factually wrong. QE is done at the behest of the government.


It is more than "influence", remember "Indeed, in a letter to the Chancellor, Governor Mark Carney requested a £15bn increase, which Philip Hammond duly **authorised**."

"Consistent with this, **I am requesting that you authorise** an increase in the total size of the APF of £25bn to £585bn, in order to accommodate expected usage of the TFS by the end of the drawdown period. "

That's right they're scamming you, anyone who supports this socialized repayment is either a) an actual moron, or b) someone who just wants to cut their losses. I can sympathize with the latter, but anyone who can't admit it, is lying to themselves. Zane hasn't said ANYTHING about actually catching this guy, or I don't know, how Bitfinex actually lost 70 million dollars of your money. How much money will Bitfinex put up (it'll be a very small number)? 
Bitfinex actually took your 70 million and even tricked the rest of you into covering it. Incredible."
 And now, 2 years later, whether it was a hack or a scam, I don't think their business has been damaged much.

I'm not discounting credible sources like the times newspaper, or a member of parliament, you are.
how about if I point out the act of parliament refering to government powers over the bank of england - then you would just dispute the wording.
same if I quoted, for instance, the governor of the bank of england to support my case, you would argue over what the words mean.


that is wrong, and here is why: " means that we set interest rates (and ‘quantitative easing’) at what we consider to be the most appropriate level" - they have to get authorisation to do it, and then they work out how much is needed. Like, if the government orders the army to invade another country, the army works out how many men are needed, but the authorisation, the orders to doso, is a separate matter - do you see how you comprehension skills are not as good as you think they are? You keep on drawing the wrong conclusions from things.
 **that's why** I keep telling you you're wrong - because you are, it really is that simple.
@_date: 2018-09-04 18:52:15
ok, let's see ... here's one example of you not understanding what is being written...


Yes, I said that first, and then you repeated it as if I had stated the opposite - confused?


as I said a while ago, "I know money printing is going on, more than I would like ... "
"... the government can get away with printing money to quite a large degree, for a very long time."
and then as I stated later on, quantitative easing (printing on a *vast* scale) is going on, and it is at the behest of the government (even though at first glance, the bank of england is independent).
 And I backed it up with sources.
It's ok that you're wrong on the internet sometimes, is this really the only way you have to handle it?
@_date: 2018-09-04 09:48:34


ok, let me present to you why I think the opposite, with *evidence* ...
First, I will write about the "term funding scheme" and how this is printing money in disguise, by the Bank of England, and then about the Chancellor of the Exchequer, ie the government, is authorising it (or however it is dressed up, my point is that in reality all this is happening because it is government policy). Ok, here goes ...
"For those of you who've lived through the past decade - crisis after crisis, of governments routinely spending enormous amounts to bail out their banks - that might not sound like a lot of money."
"So the fact that the Bank of England announced today that it would electronically print an extra £15bn of money to pour into Britain's financial system is not without consequence."
"That's because this £15bn is going into one of the most technical, abstruse schemes the Bank has ever devised."
"And where did the BoE get that money? It printed it.
Over the past year, the Bank has printed more than £78bn of cash and lent it to Britain's banks to encourage them to lend.
While this is subtly different to the quantitative easing scheme in some senses (under QE the Bank printed money to buy assets; in the TFS it prints money to lend to banks temporarily, taking collateral in exchange), in other senses it is similar."
then from here
"Indeed, in a letter to the Chancellor, Governor Mark Carney requested a £15bn increase, which Philip Hammond duly authorised."
So, this is why I believe printing is happening,  under dodgy schemes, which the government initiated (or at least goes along with) and which it could stop if it wanted to. There was a predecessor to the TFS, different name but similar effects, and even though the last link is about the TFS coming to an end, I believe something else has come along to replace it, slightly different and with a different name but with the same damaging effects. (If you want to continue to argue the point, I can look it up, I'm sure I'll find something.)
@_date: 2018-09-04 18:02:40


do you really think that's the only one I could find? Do you really think quantitative easing is not printing money under a different name?


from your own link :) :) ...
"Through open market operations, a central bank influences the money supply in an economy. Each time it buys securities (such as a government bond or treasury bill), *it in effect creates money*"

I can see from your post history that you're a naysayer, to my mind to the extent of willfully turning a blind eye to any attempt at reasonable debate, but I'll try with this particular point anyway ...
 &gt;how does it solve the problem of countries going into debt more then they should?
At the moment, I live in the UK and I conduct my affairs with GBP. I know money printing is going on, more than I would like, but GBP is the most practical, even though money printing steadily erodes my savings - my willingness to keep hold of GBP means the government can get away with printing money to quite a large degree, for a very long time.
 If bitcoin becomes mainstream, such that shops, suppliers, employees would happily accept bitcoin in lieu of GBP, and there is no / very little barrier to switching between GBP or bitcoin, then at the first sign of excessive money printing, everyone would rush for bitcoin and the policy would fail more quickly, *I believe*.
 In other words, the existence of a readily accessible / viable hard money alternative could rein in the ability of governments to get away with printing money.

yes. 30k refers to words in his published work, 60k is the estimate of his total vocab. since the topic is 'did shakespeare invent new words that ended up being in the english language', i restricted myself to the number of words in his published work.

I think the welfare state, especially state pensions, is not sustainable in the long term. I think government spending will get out of control, within 30 or 40 years, and the dollar/ pound / euro will be massively printed because the politicians will always try to just paper over the cracks instead of implementing proper, and often unpopular, solutions.
 As far as state pensions go, just calculating the money paid in by how any people, for how many years, and the money paid out tells you there is a huge unfunded shortfall, so for me, first world countries look ok now but the long term future is bleak unless we somehow get a crop of competent politicians.

If you have the words already, and just want to know the checksum word, then...
 for each word, take the number in the list, convert it to 1's and 0's, as an 11 bit binary number, and concatenate them.
 For an 11 word list, you will now have a number which is 121 bits long, not the necessary 128 bits.
 I believe you can add *any* 7 additional bits - explanation later - and this will get you to a 128 bit random number, and then do the rest of the steps described above.
 The reason you can add any additional bits to get it to the required length is that there are several checksum words that count as valid, not just one. I know this because I generated a checksum word, using a script, and the output was a list of several possible checksum words, not just 1, that is why I think it must be the case that the additional bits you need to add can be whatever you choose, it doesn't matter.
 Understand that this only occurs because an 11 word mnemonic is 121 bits of entrophy, and is not quite the same as a random 128 bit number.

The words already existed, so he did not invent them. 
Just look at what you're writing, you throw in the concept of "the process of changing those words" out of the blue, you're just making stuff up.
 You cannot show me that linguistics has a different meaning for 'invent', you're just wrong.
 If you were right, you'd have convincing arguments, or you'd link to an academic paper about linguistics where they use the word like that.
 I googled "linguistics invent" and the results are literally about fantasy authors inventing languages like J R Tolkien inventing elvish, nothing like what you're suggesting.
even, you cannot just daisy chain definitions together as you wish; 'start' could be listed as a definition of 'initiate', but invent and start are not the same.
 furthermore, you took the word 'initiate', and added on the on "process of changing those words" and claim the whole thing is allowed by the dictionary, when only 'initiate' might possibly be allowed, if that.
 just read your own words.

I'm curious about what people think when they hear claims like this. Why would a storyteller invent so many new words, when he primarily wants to communicate to his audience? Even if he invented no new words, how would someone incorporate 1/2 of a language into one's stories without making them really awkward? When would he find time to invent these new words, 'market' them so that they catch on, and write his plays? To get a rough guesstimate on the numbers involved, how many new words does j k rowling, or a sci-fi author invent? 100's?
"The compendious Oxford English Dictionary lists about 500,000 words; and a further half-million technical and scientific terms remain uncatalogued."
then if i google "number words shakespeare"
"...  the 31,534 words that Shakespeare knew and used, ..."
and, of those 32k words that he used, the vast majority would not have been invented by him.

We are told 'deflation is bad' as if it is a cast iron fact. I think many people here are fed up with the standard economic system, where people borrowing money for consumer spending is portrayed as a good thing.
 I think this is a case where there hasn't been something like bitcoin before, and people are simply bringing up 'truths' from the old model, and not considering properly if they are also applicable to these new circumstances.
 Also, economics is not a hard science like physics, in fact I think they have seen the actual, real, progress in maths / physics / chemistry / engineering, ever since the scientific method came about, and they have tried to 'claim' the same certainty and absolute truthfulness for economics and have created more harm by doing so.
 ( I just googled 'economics is not a hard science' - haven't read all the results, but looks interesting, like this one
"When a physicist or a chemist has a theory and it doesn’t work, then they abandon the theory to try something else. When an economist has a theory, they have to build in lots of, often, quite ridiculous assumptions. Then, when it doesn’t work they say ‘let’s carry on anyway’. Or, if you use a different set of assumptions the theory will work."

4) why does your alternate definition not exist in the dictionary?

ah, if you don't know how to convert from hex to binary - it is explainable, just not sure how step by step i have to go.
How familiar with numbers are you - decimal, binary and hex?
For instance, if you have the number 27, that would be 11011 in binary - do you know how to convert that?
Then for going between hex and binary - it is exactly the same principle, it is just that hex is easier for humans since it is shorter, instead of a really long sequence of 1's and 0's.
 So 27 (decimal) would be 1b in hex - 1 lot of 16 and 'b' lots of ones (where b comes in the sequence 8,9,a,b,c, so is the same as 11 in decimal).
 So you have to understand how to go from hex to binary, and you end up with a binary number 1101010101010 etc, 121 or 128 bits long.
when you sha256 hash this, it will give you a hex code, again convert this to binary. Then take the first 4 (or 8) bits of this and **append** (not mathematically add, but append) it to the original binary number.
 Then split the new number into groups of 11 bits, so something like 11001100101 - this is 1637 in decimal, so choose the 1636th word in the list (since the counting should be from 0 to 2047 instead of the normal 1st to 2048th)
@_date: 2018-05-13 21:17:50
reading your answer again, you are switching to binary before you split it up, so yes, it looks correct
@_date: 2018-05-13 19:14:17
Well, from the link that Yepnop supplied, the answer seems to be:
don't use the dice to directly pick the words from the wordlist, use the dice to generate a random number - more details on this later.
 Then get the sha256 hash of this number.
 Then take the first X bits of the hash and append it to the original number; X is 4 for a 12 word mnemonic, or 8 for a 24 word mnemonic.
 You now have a sequence of 1's and 0's which is either 132 or 264 digits long.
 Split the sequence into groups of 1's ans 0's which are 11 bits long.
 Each of these little sequences will be a binary number between 0 and 2047, thus representing a particular word from the word list.
 So, to come back to the beginning "use the dice to generate a random number" - well, if you had a coin, you could flip it 128 times, and note the 1's and 0's to come up with a random 128 bit number, so work out something similar using the dice.
 Bear in mind, with 1 dice (the proper singular of dice is die but this is falling out of fashion), then numbers 1-6 are all equally likely, but with 2 dice, then 7 is more likely that 2 or 12, so be careful.

I understand what you are saying, but what I have seen in practical terms is - you can freely choose n-1 words, and the nth word - there is not *just 1* valid nth word, but a range of them.
  Together with the fact that, for instance, 23 words gives you less than 256 bits of entrophy, i stand by what I have said. (If you start with 256 bits of entrophy, then that is quite different from starting with 23 words, as I have said above.)

statements like this are why the other people think you don't know what you're talking about.
 if they tried to buy just a million bitcoin, that would push the price up massively. As the price goes higher, the public will see the price rise exponentially and want to get in on the action, so now the price is pushed higher again as they try to reach the first million and have to outbid the public. by the time they get to their 5 millionth bitcoin, the price of 1 bitcoin would be $1000000, so buying the next million bitcoins would cost one trillion dollars.
 It's very risky for them to even start, since if they start and then realise half way through, "we won't be able to finish this", now they've spent a huge amount of money buying bitcoin at prices that they themselves have inflated, and, now that they're no longer buying, the price will plummet and they'll have made a huge loss on all the bitcoin they've just bought.
 The numbers and scale of it is beyond the point where it can all be bought up in the way you describe.
@_date: 2019-03-30 18:20:46


here's how I think of it - say I own a house and you drive by, fall in love with it and knock on my door saying you want to buy it. If i see your car is an average car, I might say the price is 100k, but if I see you're driving a bentley, i might say the price is 200k. If I think you have access to lots of money (which happens a bank can just create _lots of_ money out of thin air to lend to you), then I hold out for a higher price, and this will have an upward effect on prices.


this is influenced by what price the seller thinks he can hold out for without losing the sale, so the available money supply, which affects how much can be lent to the buyer, makes a difference

a wallet could be controlled by an individual person, or it could be controlled by a company, there's nothing intrinsic to bitcoin that will tell you which one it is - is that the question you were asking?


a lot of things i've read say that the quantitive easing (printing money) that is going on now benefits the rich much more than the normal people (middle  and working class), so the current system abets the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer, and bitcoin, or any hard money, could help level the playing field.

@_date: 2019-03-30 23:43:36

my link is to a site that analyses the actual blockchain and then tells you particular statistics about it, one of them is indeed that 1000 wallets have 40% of the bitcoin supply, but the point is, if some or all of those wallets belong to exchanges, that is very different than the 1000 wallets belonging to 1000 individuals. And some headlines state X as fact when X is instead a possibility.
 I mean, there is a measure of wealth concentration, and obviously it not ideal, but, to reiterate my point, i don't think it's trivial to attack bitcoin, even if you're a whale. Isn't this what Jihan Wu tried to do and he ended up losing a fortune instead, despite his position and money?

for those interested in knowing more ...
the human vocal tract / larynx is different in structure from most animals, so that we can make a wider range of sounds - good for speaking - but the downside is the risk of choking (food/liquid entering the lungs). 
 In babies, the structure is initially 'no danger of choking but can't make a wide range of sounds', and as they grow, this changes to 'wide range of sounds but danger of choking'.
" But de Boer says the crucial change was in separating the velum and larynx so that the larynx can no longer link to the velum. This change allows "the rounded tongue freedom of movement.""
 "As soon as there is a gap between the velum and the larynx—something which is necessary for enhanced freedom of motion of the tongue—there is a danger of food falling in the lungs."

The interest rate charged is lower on the Swiss Franc mortgage than it would be in your local currency, reflecting the expected changes in future value of the currencies - why would a bitcoin mortgage be any different?


only if both the bitcoin mortgage and the usd/ euro/gbp mortgage had the same interest rate, which is not what has happened so far with existing foreign currency mortgages.
 So, if we have a btc economy, I would, for instance, be willing to lend out btc at 5% interest but for lending out a dollar loan, where I'm paid back in dollars over 25 years, i might ask for 50% if I think the dollar is going to fall against btc over that time period.

but where is this defined? by who?
I'm saying that going up in value does not prevent something being a store of value, not because it is defined somewhere but because if someone has Venezuelan Bolivars and exchanges them for US dollars, so as not to lose their buying power, then they don't mind if the dollars even appreciate against the Bolivar.
 As I see it, I have common sense on my side, and you claim "it's defined" but, again, where is defined and by who?
 If it turns out it is a specific piece of economists jargon that has a very narrow meaning, then OK, I would have learned something new.

No. Apart from the fact that literally you are wrong, the point being made is, you can effortlessly create a billion USD as easily and quickly as creating a million, the only limit to how fast the government (or central bank, whoever the issuing authority is) can create new currency is self-control.
 With bitcoin, you can't just create a load more when you want to, the rate / schedule of bitcoin creation is (more or less) fixed and no one can alter it.
 That is the point he was making when he said "by *merely typing* a few numbers into a computer"
 (I say you are literally wrong because bitcoin is mined by solving a mathematical problem, in competition with other miners, not by just telling the computer how many bitcoins you want it to create for you)

a lot of your wealth and prosperity depends on how well your parents did, to counter that you want your society to have good social mobility, not sure if bitcoin can address that problem, don't really think it's fair to criticise it for that.
 Also, it's not really about what they can afford, it's about how much they understand / believe in it and how much they're prepared to risk. You'll end up with people who didn't want to risk their money, then complain later when they missed out.


Anyone can invent a new coin to try and do this, getting people to follow you is hard though.

I've tried to run some numbers myself:
total hashrate now ~ 40 million million million
total bitcoin users ~ 20 million
hashrate of a single gpu ~ 200 million
so if 20 million people ran 1 gpu each, the difference would be 4000 million million divided by 40 million million million, or about 1 in 10 000, so 0.01 percent? - I think I have the numbers about right.

about this idea, someone pointed out that there was no financial risk for people to move from Myspace to Facebook, or to open accounts on both. This is different from choosing whether to put your fiat into bitcoin or an altcoin, and risk losing all if you make the wrong choice.


Well, looks at the merits of the tech to decide which camp bitcoin falls into. So, I draw parallels with bitcoin and Darwin publishing his theory of evolution - the theory was so right and all-encompassing from the start that it's not going to be replaced (or, many would be happy to bet their money that it's not going to be replaced).
 (Later ideas like epigenetics, they weren't in the original theory and they do add more knowledge, but they don't really invalidate Darwin's original theory, they don't make it obsolete.)
@_date: 2018-06-10 09:54:38


so, the basic idea is, if it's happening too fast, then slow down, and if it's happening too slowly then speed up, and the target is a steady speed.
 The problem is, how fast do you make the correction? If you only make infrequent and slow adjustments, that's sub-optimal since you're spending lots of time at the wrong speed. *But* if you make adjustments that are too fast (and/or too frequent, not sure?), then you overshoot and have to correct back *and* (here is the danger), you may end up oscillating (perhaps violently) around your ideal value instead of settling down to your ideal value.
 The further danger is, the oscillations would not occur every time, but only under some conditions, like if the 'input' changes from one set of values to another within a set time, so deciding on your EDA parameters is very tricky.
 (I imagine if your adjustments are too frequent, then you let transitory blips cause a big disruption, when you'd have been better off just ignoring them for a while to see if it goes away on it's own.)
 This is something called control theory - I'm not an expert but I know it exists and this is one of the basic things you learn about it. It is for problems like, how do you set the position of a gun turret, how do you regulate the output voltage of a power supply, etc.

say you have a street of 50 identical houses. all valued at 200k. if *one* of those houses sells next week for 300k, now the value of the whole street has 'gone up'.
 You might say 'they haven't all gone up to 300k, it's only because that buyer just won the lottery and could pay more', but then you would be individually examining the circumstances of every sale; instead, to use the last achieved price and to apply it to all the other houses is the only objective, repeatable and consistent way to place a value on it.
 In this case, of the 16 or 17 million bitcoins in existence, only a portion are up for sale at a time, and their sale price is then applied to all the bitcoins in existence.
@_date: 2018-06-24 09:48:21


 I think the point you make is a huge problem, and I can imagine in the future a well-trusted government like Norway could offer a bitcoin holding service to their citizens, perhaps for a small annual fee, with guarantees and so on like people have with their bank accounts now, with that security / safety blanket balanced against the (negligible?) chance that the government will go rogue.
 But for people thinking of investing in bitcoin right now, when the risk of accidentally losing everything is still here, you don't have to invest 100% of your portfolio into crypto, you can invest just 1% or 5% - whatever you're comfortable with regarding risk vs reward.

well, in the same way that many here do not trust fiat, one cannot really trust an investment in gold unless you store it yourself. With bitcoin, you know if you have it, and if it's genuine, or not.
If I want to sell it, the market is very liquid and efficient, whereas with gold, there is a fair sized difference between the buy and sell prices.
 Bitcoin may be volatile week to week and month to month, but for a long term store of value, I believe it will hold true while other assets fail. As for how it behaves in the short or even medium term, I don't mind, for me a store of value is a long term thing.
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:28:45


I believe the opposite.

people who think a deflationary currency could be a good thing - now I'm not talking about bitcoin but more a general point about day to day future currency used by the whole population - they're not talking about a currency that deflates 30% in a day.
 They think of something mildly deflationary or even just zero inflation. If there's a deflation rate of 2% a year, it's not going to stop me buying food, nor even investing in stocks if a company looks like it might take off.:
 There are some people who believe things 'on authority', and some who want evidence, especially now when governments tell us things are going great but we feel society is heading downhill.

I also disagree, because if someone has a better idea and makes a new coin, how will enough people have enough faith that the new coin also has no security flaws as well as it's one good idea?
 Bitcoin has / will have a solid history of being secure and 'battle hardened' and any new coin will have to try to thrive and survive against that.
@_date: 2018-06-09 09:53:14
I think the general principle does, as you say, also apply to stocks. But the reason it can be used with more confidence is that the greater volume of trades means one can place a greater confidence in the last price achieved.
 With the example of a house, volumes are relatively low and sales are infrequent, maybe the house buyer viewed the house when there was a glorious, glowing sunset, etc - with a house, each sale could well have 'special circumstances' attached to it, but with buying a share, one share is identical to another in the same company, so you can better apply the last price to the next sale.

 From that link
"Chinese is spoken in over thirty-five countries with almost 1.2 billion native speakers in the world." - nothing said about total of native and non-native speakers.
"If we were to solely count those who speak Spanish as a first language, native Spanish speakers would surpass native English speakers with over 400 million speakers."
 - again, they only talk about native speakers, and nothing said about total of native and non-native speakers.
"Whether you are one of the over 375 million people who speak English as a first language, or one of the 1.5 billion people who speak English as a second language,"

@_date: 2018-06-09 10:35:44
hmm, maybe there's an extra factor in play, specifically with regard to cryptocurrencies and their increased volatility compared to conventional investments like stocks, gold and property.
 If stocks, gold and property change price slowly, then last price is a good guide to next price, but if it is very volatile like bitcoin, then this holds true less.
 Also, because conventional assets are 'something real', their value tomorrow is similar to today, is similar to yesterday, whereas if bitcoin simply goes out of fashion, like beanie babies, then the price would plummet very fast, so this adds uncertainty to it?
 Also, especially with altcoins, but bitcoin is tarred by the same brush to an extent, if pumping and dumping goes on, then market cap is a very transitory number, so people know to take it with a pinch of salt, but surely the google share price isn't up and down like an alt coin value is?
 I don't know for certain, I'm just trying to take real world observations and make a theory out of them. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 09:16:05
ok, so I googled "most widely spoken language" and went to the wikipedia link
they have English as first (1.12 billion), Chinese 2nd (1.1 billion) and Spanish a distant 4th (512 million).
 I did find some older (?) data having Chinese first, but think about it - if that data was even just 10 years old, things have changed a lot since then, in *this* area.
 Another point is, imagine all the kids under 12 who speak their mother tongue but have not yet learned enough English to count as being English speakers - they will skew the above statistics. If you take them out, for instance if one was mainly interested in (economically-) active internet users, then the dominance of English would be even greater.
 As a sanity check, the wiki page on Reddit says they have about 250 million unique visitors, so if they all speak English, that's just the ones on Reddit, so how many English speakers do you think there are worldwide?

the old definitions were written before bitcoin existed, so they don't properly cover it, I think. (like, if you wrote a definition of a mammal 300 years ago, and then after that they discover Australia and the egg-laying platypus.)
'there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins, it's just that they are being released slowly instead of all of them being created instantly at the beginning.
 with fiat inflation, you slowly lose the value of your money this year, next year, the year after that, and so on ad infinitum.
 with bitcoin, you know that if you buy 1 bitcoin, you're buying 1/21millionth of the total supply - with fiat, 1 dollar will be 1/x of the total money supply in the future, and 1/x may (will) change and be outside of your control. For me, that's the practical difference; those people who debate inflationary or deflationary, they're just words that were defined before the game changing bitcoin existed.

Why is this so hard to understand ?
You are wasting tons of energy and heat for no reason.
um, the power losses would be higher. 
to reduce power transmission losses, you want to stick to as high a voltage as possible for as long as possible, which he is doing by having the power at mains voltage until just before each miner.
(This is why electricity pylons are at thousands of volts, then you have a sub-transformer once you reach a residential area, to lower it to domestic voltages [240 or 110 range], and then if you need lower voltages, like 5v or 12v , that's done at the last stage.)

this sounds just like another embellishment? is there a record of such a case happening? It's not really important if such a case literally happened, but if someone pointed out to me that I was giving so much credence to unusual and unsupported claims, without even realising I was doing it, I would want to change that. (maybe there is documentation of such a happening, in which case you're not displaying a worrying pattern of ceaselessly writing very colourful imagery as fact that happened, in which case i do apologise; I'm sticking my nose in because i do wish there was more actual facts and truth written on the internet than there is.)

yes that is a good point; my point was merely that there is no way of knowing who is behind all of these addresses, including whether they are individuals or companies, that is why i specifically objected to the use of individual.
 I did find this:
"As two of the world’s most popular cryptocurrency exchanges, Bitfinex and Bittrex have a huge amount of Bitcoin to store — a large portion of which can be found in two cold storage wallets. Bitfinex’s address, 3D2oetdNuZUqQHPJmcMDDHYoqkyNVsFk9r, holds 192,004 BTC ($1,299,772,969) and Bittrex’s address, 16rCmCmbuWDhPjWTrpQGaU3EPdZF7MTdUk, holds 142,203 BTC ($1,137,661,177). These are also the only two addresses holding more than 100,000 BTC, and together they make up 2% of all Bitcoins in existence."
and also, 40% divided by 1000 averages out to about 7000, which in the old days was a trivial amount, for instance this guy accidentally threw away 7500 bitcoins because it was worth next to nothing at the time:
would be interesting to match these big addresses to the date they had bitcoin put into them, and see how much the money was worth at the the time, I'm sure it would be a much more reasonable figure.

"Whenever a bank makes a loan, it simultaneously creates a matching deposit in the borrower’s bank account, thereby creating new money."
plenty of links if you google "banks create money when they lend"
"Banks can create money through the accounting they use when they make loans. The numbers that you see when you check your account balance are just accounting entries in the banks’ computers. These numbers are a ‘liability’ or IOU from your bank to you. But by using your debit card or internet banking, you can spend these IOUs as though they were the same as £10 notes. By creating these electronic IOUs, banks can effectively create a substitute for money."

 Your example - it makes sense **if** I physically hand you $100 in real bank notes (to real life you, not you as a bank), and if you then hand over $90 of **real bank notes** to Joe, but if banking and spending is electronic now, then those physical restrictions do not apply?

but why do you think these people are just assuming? It could be (and it is in my case) that they *have* considered other coins and have thought it through and come to the conclusion, whether that conclusion is correct or not, that bitcoin is the only coin that will matter

this sentiment simply doesn't ring true. Where LonelySoulComplex is coming from is talking about the potential loss as a %age of your money, not an absolute amount.

volatile is not the same as risky.
I am sure long term bitcoin will increase in value massively, so for me it is not risky. On the way there, there may be huge ups and downs, so it could well be volatile. But volatile and risky and different concepts, related but different.

there's a book from the 19th century (so freely available now) by Andrew Dickson White, about the monetary history of the french revolution, called "Fiat Money Inflation in France: How it Came, What it Brought, and How it Ended"
 Basically, they introduced a new fiat currency, to grease the wheels of commerce, backed by the land they had just confiscated from the aristocrats (and/or church, I don't remember it 100%).
 It all starts off well-intentioned, but things get out of hand, governments prefer to print more money rather than take hard decisions to fix the economy, no one wants to accept the new money, legal threats of the guillotine ensue, the government makes a public ceremony of smashing the engraving plates (for printing the currency) to restore confidence in their economic policies, then shortly after bring out another currency with a different set of plates and a promise that this time they'll do it differently, etc.
 Anyway, I found it interesting as a real world, large scale playing out of what people on here surmise will happen in our own future.
 The writing is dreadfully old fashioned, but I ploughed through because I thought it's important to know how it turned out.

consensus. This time you follow the herd mentality and buy into the same thing as everyone else, so if you want to sell your bitcoin in the future (for goods or services or fiat), there's a healthy market for it.


if a government feels the need to curtail it's citizens making free and independent economic decisions about where to invest their own money, wouldn't this be a clear sign to everyone that the government and the economy is not in a healthy way? it would just stoke up the demand for bitcoin, i think, while also probably not being effective and highlighting the government's inability to ban it.
 I think these topics have already been covered by Andreas A, would be more efficient if you went through his videos imo.

Maybe its because goodcoins are good.
this is interesting, I think you have not followed the logic correctly, even though on first glance you have. If, for example, your opinion of someone is 'he doesn't have a girlfriend because he's so ugly', it doesn't mean that when he does get a girlfriend, the thing that changed *must be*, *can only be*, his ugliness.
 So, he said one reason why he thinks X occurs, but he didn't rule out several different reasons / causes that could get it out of situation X.
@_date: 2018-07-20 09:51:05
I think not, and here is why:
if you mean one individual sending to another individual, then it would be vastly inefficient to buy so much that you distort the market against yourself (pushing price up when you want to buy) and the receiver faces the same problem in reverse, that he is selling so much btc that he pushes the price down. The huge inefficiency mean you would choose another method.
 If the large flows are from lots of people making little transfers, then you would expect the buying and selling to cancel out, unless, by an incredible chance, all the different, unconnected, senders bought at the same time, to push the price up, and all the receivers sold at the same time, pushing the price down, *with no overlap* in when the mass buying and the mass selling happened.

such a shame they got a detail wrong - the Trojan horse was deliberately built too tall to fit through the city gates, as a more convincing detail that the Greeks *definitely* did not want the Trojans to drag it into Troy (and the Trojans ended up knocking down the top part of the gate in their desire to bring the horse inside).

you should probably specify what bits you didn't understand, to save some poor soul typing out an mini-essay that covers bits you already understand.
 Also, it's otherwise unclear what to write for you that hasn't been written on here - so many posts and debates about ETFs - already.

I totally agree with this (and the rest, but this snippet is the crux of the matter)
@_date: 2018-07-24 09:17:45


this is the key observation
@_date: 2018-07-24 08:51:46


no, instead an individual bitcoin will become more and more valuable, while using smaller and smaller denominations - a few satoshis - will become common.
 this is why some people are buying bitcoin, because if it does get adopted by entire nations, the outcome is not creating more bitcoins but an increase in the value of each single bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-20 17:52:37


I think this is not true, because it ignores something important - the solution to a block has to be totally unrelated to the previous solution, otherwise whoever solves block 112 might be able to re-use some of his calculations to solve block 113, giving him a headstart over the other miners.
 The 'mindlessness' of the bitcoin POW system, it's total disconnect from any real world situation, also lets every miner be confident that the mining of every block is a totally fresh start.
@_date: 2018-04-28 21:38:57


I don't agree with this at all. The message in the genesis block was "Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks" - an implicit complaint about money printing, and bitcoin being an alternative store of value is a very important part of the vision.
 The genesis block message wasn't "Aren't Paypal fees high?" or anything like that.

the long term goal is .... you are at risk that one day your government will face difficult problems and will decide to solve their problems by creating lots of new money.
 They can create their new money at the press of a button, to create trillions is as easy as creating billions or millions.
 You may live today in an advanced country, but the day may still come in 20 or 30 years time.
 You may have worked hard to accumulate 100,000 dollars, and it could get wiped out by hyperinflation.
The fixed production schedule of bitcoin removes this possibility, so as long as lots of people reach consensus that it is valuable, then that is why it should hold it's value, even if governments mismanage things.

i'm also debating a job, i don't care how much the salary is, just as long as i can easily spend however much they give me.
what job pays you in bitcoin but you have to ask these questions? perhaps cleaning toilets but working at a cryptoexchange? can't think of much else
@_date: 2018-12-14 16:55:27


it feels like you're saying 'it could be a million, it could be zero, it's just like tossing a coin', like those people who say investing in bitcoin is like gambling in a casino, which I don't think is a correct view.
edit: basically, what I'm trying to say is, going back to the OP, I think it will be justified that people are berated 'OMG, why didn't you buy bitcoin all those years ago' - I believe anyone can look at the state of government finances and realise that bitcoin is the answer and it's success is highly likely. It's not just a guess, maybe it will succeed, maybe it won't - it's success is connected with the state and the health of government finances.
@_date: 2018-12-14 14:50:58


I don't quite agree, because this makes it sound as if bitcoin maximalists just randomly picked a winning ticket, by sheer luck.  The thing is, anyone can *already* see that governments cannot even fund future pension commitments, such that the existing system is broken and the value of bitcoin is *highly* likely to increase against fiat in the long term. (Similarly, those people who think bitcoin is the only crypto currency that will survive, and all others are unnecessary and will end up worthless, because of their views of how game theory applies to this - someone will turn round later and say 'oh, that was just a lucky guess.')

a hodler does not think **everyone** hodling is ideal - everyone realises you need a healthy market of sellers and buyers. A hodler may think hodling is better than day-trading, or he may think 'even though I'm up 1000%, i'll be up 10000% if I wait longer', but he knows you need a liquid market as well, that someone has to be buying and selling, just not him at this moment in time.


there is a mistake in your line of reasoning here - if I hodl with the intent to get rich, it doesn't affect the behaviour of **everyone else**, it doesn't mean that everyone else in the entire world is somehow going to be forced to hodl
essentially, I think you've made a mistake saying 'if you do X blah blah blah because everyone does X', whereas it doesn't necessarily follow that everyone will do X

you keep on saying this but I don't think it's a valid point. Every currency that has experienced hyperinflation - surely there too that currency was required to pay taxes in? In Weimar Germany or Zimbabwe, surely there you still needed to pay taxes in the local fiat currency?
 Surely if I'm a merchant in Venezuela today, I would rather take payment in USD, and then at the end of the tax year, when my taxes are due, I can **easily** swap my dollars for however many Bolivar I need?
 I think if people have lost faith in a currency, you can't shore up it's value **that much** by requiring local taxes to be paid in it, or by any other law.
@_date: 2018-12-10 15:56:50


seriously, do you actually have an answer to this point? I am genuinely interested if you do, you repeat "will throw ... in jail if they don't pay taxes in local fiat currency" so often, as a reason why local currency will always stay strong, but i think you're wrong. If you were right, then any government could avoid hyperflation simply by requiring taxes to be paid in that currency?

That’s scamming not counterfeiting.
i agree with this, the distinction is between scamming and counterfeiting
