Are there any people who mine solo nowadays or is it all about the pools?

Well if miners want to keep getting the same profit shouldn't they sell at double the price?

What does supply shock mean and what will it cause?  (Sorry, bad English)

Hey mate can you give me some tips? I want to get to 2 coins from 1.45 before the price jumps.

Haha yes of course but I have no money at the moment.  I started off with 0.5 and traded my way to 1.4.

I just had some lucky moments that's all.

Oh man, that's pretty bad. But they are pretty smart to be able to pull off something like this, don't you think?

What exactly does not sound legit here? I just want to know what happened to the price. I do not own bitcoins myself so it's not really something that bothers me but I am just extremely curious.

[But... why?](

I don't own any bitcoins, a friend of mine and his brother have around 30 or so and back when they were here in my country I would enjoy spending time with them watching the prices, the market etc. Soon they are going to visit and I instantly remembered about the bitcoins and I was shocked when I checked. Curiousity followed soon after.
