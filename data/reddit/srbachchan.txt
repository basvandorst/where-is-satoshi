if they actually wait for real trades to happen, the orders will be jammed due to Bitcoin's 10-60 confirmation time. They will ofcourse have to pretend to be executing the orders, or risk jamming. Overall, its an addition and subtraction game.

Moral of the story: don't trade Bitcoins if you are scared of losing. Or just come and live with the flaws, while making loads of money..

I would love such animated price analysis in near future. :)
@_date: 2016-07-11 10:40:34
we are still unsure about the demand.. for now, lets just believe that supply is not the only factor behind Bitcoin's price movements.
