Free transactions are one of the best features of bitcoin. No other currency in the world offers that (except cash of course). Fortunately, bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency.
I wouldn't mind if free transactions take very long time to confirm. Perhaps I'm sending paying rent to my landlord or sending money to my family. It cain wait few blocks. Call me a cheap bastard, but I like the feeling of getting things for free.
EDIT: Actually... services such as PayPal, Google Wallet, Venmo, Bank of America etc. all offer free transactions with your friends and families. Instantly. WTF Bitcoin?

So you believe there can be only one true blockchain network?
@_date: 2017-02-19 19:23:05
That's absolutely true. But wouldn't you agree that having multiple blockchains and rich developer ecosystem is good for all users and all blockchains?
@_date: 2017-02-19 22:35:21
Simple. Core is centralized but Bitcoin is not. If Bitcoin were centralized, SegWit would have been activated long time ago. However, the truth is Bitcoin development is centralized around core and Bitcoin mining is centralized around Chinese mining cartel. So now you have 2 centers so so speak and they haven't made an agreement yet.
I support SegWit and block size increase at the same time. But I'd also like to see more efforts to decentralize both development and mining.

Excuse me, we are having two discussions in different threads but I think they both boil down to the same difference in ideas. You might be on the "correct" branch of this divisive argument.

I think you misunderstood my comment. There are core developers but also other developers and there is nothing wrong with other developers and other ideas existing.

I'm sure there is diversity in the right column and that is great. But also having multiple columns is great.

It might end soon in favor of BU or later in favor of a compromise. Bitcoin will always be the first cryptocurrency and nothing will change that.
I understand your concern about altcoins but just imagine... If another coin takes a lead in security, innovation, price and utilization... What's wrong with that?
Just to be clear, I'm not advocating for any particular "shitcoin scam altcoin" but in a hypothetical situation where another coin is ahead of Bitcoin in every single dimension, what's wrong with that?
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:20:52
Could pow algorithm be randomized every n retargeting periods? Perhaps it could have different wights for many different sorts of computing and memory access operations and you change those weights pseudorandomly. That way, the asic manufacturers can't optimize for every single flavor of PoW without essentially making a CPU.

You are talking about stopping community divide by saying we should fight the other guys. FYI, there are people on the other side of the divided community who believe in on-chain scaling and are not paid by anyone.
Perhaps you could suggest uniting the communities by compromising and finding a middle ground by making some sort of agreement and respecting it. Then miners and developers can work together to make a safe fork.
2MB blocks will not make much difference and if it means SegWit gets activate we might not need another block size increase ever.
If you're gonna say how 2MB is way too much, we are done talking.

@_date: 2017-02-19 19:27:53
It's true, but also two networks half the size have the same combined value. I would even argue that they have more than same value due to value added by competition and diversity. Monopoly is not necessarily a good thing.

@_date: 2017-03-18 16:15:46
How about a PoW algorithm that changes pseudorandomly? It would be more difficult to design an asic before knowing what to optimize it for.

@_date: 2017-03-07 09:23:59
Yes, but keep in mind you will have equal balance on both chains at the time of the fork. You can continue using or ignoring any of the two chains. However, if you hate BU, it probably best if you sell it right away and hold to Core.
@_date: 2017-03-06 20:57:00
UASF can backfire so bad. Miners can retaliate by mining a shit ton of valid empty blocks making the network unusable. It's no way rational or in their best interest, but UASF is pretty much a declaration of war to miners.

This will not cause BU to activate but may increase the signal above 40% (still far from needed 75%). I hope it doesn't activate but force two sides to compromise. A carefully planned HF with 2MB+SW with 95% activation threshold would be a great solution to make everyone equally happy and unhappy.

@_date: 2017-03-15 05:58:55
It's kind of ironic but the bug does not show how Unlimited developers act as children. On contrary, the way Core community is reacting is extremely childish.
You can argue that they are inferior developers. I would agree about that. However, the debate at the heart of this community divide is about human values, vision and freedom.
This incident showed me that most core "believers" are blinded. This is not about which implementation is better. It's about what bitcoin represents.

Also worth noting is that market cap of Bitcoin is roughly 0.1% of gold.
@_date: 2017-03-25 15:38:56
That's it. There is a strong polarization in the community about what is the "right" direction for Bitcoin. Most agree that they want to make money by holding. They want to see the price rising.
But that's not enough to unite them since they disagree about what gives Bitcoin value and how it should be used.
On this particular forum you will see that most people believe that Bitcoins deflationary nature and security is the most important feature. On some other forums, there are many who believe Bitcoin should be used for everyday transactions.

@_date: 2017-03-08 00:14:47
You are correct, but those "few core developers" could talk to other developers about the sentiment of the miners they met at the conference and conclude that it is a way forward that won't split the Bitcoin community. Of course all core devs will not reach concensus, but that Hong Kong agreement was the closest they had. Honestly, they blew it when they failed to realize that.
They can write the best code, but it takes more than that to maintain relationships and nurture communities.

You can ALL CAPS all you want but that does not change the sentiment of the miners. BU is happening, if core is quick enough they can perform the attack soon.
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:28:08
Oh I see what you are saying. Right, miners have to choose the transactions before they find the block solution but as they continuously mine they can change the transactions at any moment and that is not affecting their chances of finding a block. You are right, what I originally wrote was wrong.

Too bad there are too many stakeholders who do not benefit from on chain scaling.

If that is true, its called renting hash power and anyone with money can legally do it. No one can tell you how you spend your money and as a miner no one can tell you who you sell you hash power too. If Ver wants to burn his money on this there is nothing stopping him. You have to understand all agents in this economic system are acting in their selfish interests. That is especially true for miners. Maybe some small miners are doing it to feel good about it, but other are trying to make as much money as possible.
@_date: 2017-08-19 11:33:58
Whatever I say, you'll say its variance. Also, look at last hour of blocks.

@_date: 2017-08-18 15:02:38
Why do you think this is a strong argument? This issue happens today and there is no real problem associated with it? Sure, rarely transactions slip a block but if blocks are bigger, they would be included in the next one for sure.
I'm wondering what is the current frequency of this kind of event and what will it be in the other chain once blocks become close to full. It will be interesting to compare real world data.
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:41:57
How about now? (9 hours later blocks still coming in faster and faster)
@_date: 2017-01-01 23:46:21
So you have a proof that Roger is paying miners? I would love to see that proof since you have it. (conspiracy theory is not a proof)
@_date: 2017-01-03 00:39:44
Really?! By bitcoin law? The only rules of Bitcoin are the ones built into the protocol or any government laws applied by the country in which miners and users operate. Even if what you say is true, miners still have the freedom to change pools and if they care about their vote, they have moral responsibility to choose vote over slightly bigger mining reward. But if they choose a slightly bigger reward, it is their choice (vote). Selling your vote in your country's elections is illegal. Selling your voting power to pool by choice is not.

@_date: 2017-08-24 04:34:08
Because it's how Bitcoin is designed. If you find a block, you choose what transactions are included.
@_date: 2017-08-31 06:23:44

Perhaps if segwit succeeds on LTC network and induces price rise, it would motivate miners to signal!
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:10:24
That is true, however, I think you overestimate how much more likely it would happen. Blocks are found anywhere from 1 ms to an hour since the previous block due to variance distributed on a bell curve maxing at 10 minutes time. The scenario we are discussing is only pertinent in rare cases that are are the very far tip of that curve and risk area for 1MB vs 8MB is almost the same.
Now I'm gonna take some numbers out of my ass but we are essentially talking about 0.0001% risk vs 0.0002% risk for an event that is not really an issue.

It really comes down to conspiracy theories. It is not secret that mr. Ver supports certain ideas. You also support some other ideas perhaps and so do I and sometime we pay money to support those ideas. Its like giving money or campaigning for a politician. But calling out a bribe for running a pool or renting hash power is ludicrous. Perhaps your definition of "bribe" is screwed or you simply don't understand how economy and politics work.
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:33:17
Why? With bigger blocks (8MB) it might happen twice as much (much less actually) but it will be 8x less problematic since there is always space to include it in next block.
In other words 8x block size is 8x more transaction space but 8x block size is marginally higher frequency (less than 2x) of empty blocks due to block propagation time.
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:12:37
It's uncertain. If miners continue leaving to the new chain, you might never get confirmed. But that probably won't happen since another difficulty adjustment is coming up in the new chain and some miners should come back to legacy chain.
@_date: 2017-08-19 07:28:04
It is not fud. Hashrate is moving, prices are correcting and difficulty adjustment is about to happen. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 07:47:30
That is simply not how it works. I don't know what else to tell you. Maybe read up on how mining works?
@_date: 2017-01-16 23:10:21
Agreed. However moving BTC across exchanges can be extremely slow (in HFT terms). Perhaps they could one of the faster networks for transfer purposes.

Once the segwit gets activated you will have an option to have cheaper transactions by committing some amount of BTC to a payment channel. However, opening and closing payment channels will continue to be more expensive over time.

Also, it doesn't matter. As pointed out, ideal block size is ~300KB so if we have 2 out of 3 blocks completely empty, that would make the effect the same (with slightly longer confirmation times unfortunately) Maybe more miners should start mining empty blocks.
@_date: 2017-08-17 12:58:26
So lightning payment channels don't need segwit????
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:43:00
Why would anyone sane not be interested in altcoins? Do you seriously believe there is only one crypto that matters??? The only conclusion I can make from your premise is that big blockers are all sane?
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:10:48
This is only relevant for GPU based POW. Please correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2017-01-03 16:47:56
Are you seriously asking that question? No I'm not paid by Ver and I never interacted with him.
@_date: 2017-01-02 23:44:57
Or until satoshi's coins start to move ;)
@_date: 2016-11-02 09:44:37
If you cant afford one Bitcoin you are in a less fortunate financial situation than most of the people in this subreddit. Please be advised that bitcoin price is volatile and don't invest more than you are prepared to loose.
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:17:12
If you ignore Bitcoin, you're gonna have a bad time.
@_date: 2017-08-26 08:34:37
Use a spreadsheet.
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:56:38
Now that we have segwit, never again!!!
@_date: 2017-01-27 03:01:17
I don't see any solid argument that proves that miners are not in control. Sure, they don't control if users want to be on a loosing fork as well. In theory, loosing forks value will drop to almost zero... But in real life (as we saw with ETC) it really comes down to exchanges and speculation. We can argue wether ETH fork was a success or not, but we cannot argue that the decision has been made by miners. Edit: grammar
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:21:22
Glad I could open your eyes ;)
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:35:01
Not yet, I'm gonna hold. It's free cash so I have nothing to lose :)
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:29:58
Very small chance. If they used RBF feature, they can resend transaction with higher fee to increase chance of early block inclusion.
@_date: 2017-01-19 00:54:41
That wouldn't work because you can't change POW without miners consent. You can however use a different criptocurrency 
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:08:27
Can you be nice?
@_date: 2016-11-24 21:21:46
That's so not true. Just look at all the monopolies that rob the users for a shitty product/service they depend on. Any competitor that tries to compete in the market get crushed by the big guy. You can argue that it's all fair game but that's not what bitcoin is (was) about.
@_date: 2016-12-30 14:30:20


And then what?
@_date: 2017-08-19 22:27:16
look at the blocks in last 12 hours. Last 10 minute 5 blocks found. Variance is a bitch.
@_date: 2016-11-25 03:27:23
Regardless of how monopolies are created, my point is... if someone is willing to pay for something it does not necessarily mean its a fair price. Monopoly was just anexample. Bitcoin is an opposite of monopoly, but there are other factors which could make transactions less than fair for the users even if they are willing to pay in most circumstances.
@_date: 2016-12-06 06:28:25
Thanks for breaking down the math. That is pretty much the theory I've read so far. Ideally, the extra transaction space could make up for the reduced miner reward (per transaction) and assuming but only if the blocks keep being full (most likely it will it seems). There are many unknown variables of course.
@_date: 2016-12-05 16:30:41


Maybe later, if that becomes an issue but right now things are going well for miners and there is no pressure to give up mining fees just yet.
Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe segwit will data will cost 1/4 less than regular transactions so miners would actually get less money with segwit, even it the number of transactions is significantly higher.
@_date: 2017-08-25 09:57:51
What if developers behave irrationally?
@_date: 2017-08-22 09:27:20
Bitcoin is a Bch ;)
@_date: 2016-12-04 00:33:19
Miners have no incentive to adopt segwit at the moment. Price is growing and fees are getting higher. Things are going well for miners right now.
@_date: 2016-11-25 04:21:15
Is western union your frame of reference? They are practically robbing people and bitcoin is slowly getting there. 
@_date: 2016-12-24 04:21:11
Unfortunately your transaction probably has many inputs so your fee will be higher than usual. I don't think we will see a solution to this in Bitcoin anytime soon. It's a complex political problem to solve. However, for small, quick and cheap transactions there is plenty of possibilities in the overall criptocurency space.
@_date: 2016-12-30 03:04:28
Well let's wait and see. What if the support does not reach 30% in a month? Or stays below 50% in a year? Would that be a stalemate?
Remind me one month
@_date: 2016-12-30 01:36:12
It seems to me segwit will never be activated without block size increase. Sooner or later you will have realize it's a stalemate. Even if support goes to 90% it's not going to get the BU votes.
Edit: this is matter of politics, not technology adoption.
@_date: 2016-11-24 15:57:43
You shouldn't use bitcoin for purchases, it's not meant for that.
@_date: 2016-12-29 02:40:30
I'd wait for the smiley to go to $3000 then switch to frowny. Sell high buy low. Simple.
@_date: 2016-12-24 04:27:23
Question. What happens if the hardware wallet just stops working? Say due to moisture, heat or some other reason.
@_date: 2015-08-17 08:54:11
One more question... If I mine in one of the big pools and my XT miner finds a block. Does the pool decide which block version gets broadcast to the network? If so, then the big mining pools have all the voting power.
@_date: 2015-08-19 08:31:37
So they say we should either accept XT or they will perform a terrorist attack?
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:20:39
Also BCH trading volume surpassed BTC today
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:01:46
This is how it's supposed to be
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:22:42


It most definitely hard forked before. Many times.
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:30:46
YES!!! I've been saying this the whole time. Let the Core developers decide.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:04:29
Sigh... You are witnessing market at work.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:50:17
Proof of stake is the future. I wouldn't be surprised if governments ban mining ome  day due to its environmental impact. It is simply waste of energy (although making some people rich)
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:05:47
What a lovely community!
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:06:57
Bitcoin has hard forked before (including block size). By these standards, Bitcoin is altcoin itself.
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:56:48
The writing style is just immature. Is satoshi 12 y/o?
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:52:04
Its the block size, plain and simple. No room for your transaction at the moment.
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:32:07
How can a person buy $5 worth of BTC? That is less than a transaction fee.
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:19:07
And judging by current trajectory, it never will have consensus again.
@_date: 2015-08-17 08:38:26
@_date: 2017-04-01 18:00:03
Excellent sense of humor! Bravo!
@_date: 2015-08-17 02:49:15
Got it! So although the XT requires forked software it will behave no different than original bitcon until most miners switch to it. What is the mechanism of determining the percentage of hashing power it runs on? I assume the block size transition will be automatic and hard coded in the software.
@_date: 2017-04-22 14:17:54
Perhaps... But if Litecoin scales on chain, settlement layer will not be necessary.
@_date: 2016-09-04 06:25:16
I know what you're saying. Seems like most people here just want to get filthy rich as BTC price goes to the moon. Most of them have the same greedy mentally as a average wannabe Wall St big shot.
But there are also people here (and other crypto forums) who don't care about personal wealth much, and genuinely see the vision where crypto brings economic freedom to everyone the world.
I think the most successful crypto is yet to come. And that one will not make its early adopters filthy rich.
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:01:56
But BCH got even cheaper so effect is actually the opposite
@_date: 2017-09-23 11:45:40
Any devs can fork off and part of the community will follow them (the ones who agree/believe in the protocol change) Community cannot fork without devs. Devs can fork anytime and community forks with it.
@_date: 2017-10-01 05:13:40
Put on your tinfoil hats!!!
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:37:25
Notice that every time bitcoin crashes, other cryptos crash harder. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 07:44:51
He/she simply counts the number of his/hers twitter followers who add no2x to their handle. If they wear it as a hat it counts double. That's consensus!
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:06:29
Yet it does. Once PoS becomes active, substantial amount of it will be staked for profit therefore becoming unavailable for trade. In other words, supply will get much lower in certain sense. I wonder what will that do to the price.
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:07:28
Can we cut this crap already?
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:48:56
This sentence makes no sense. Perhaps you misspelled?

@_date: 2017-10-27 18:47:33
If the fork like this happens, and S1X chain hashrate drops to 2%, the value will drop causing more miners to transition to S2X eventually killing S1X chain.
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:38:13
According to miner signals, it still has roughly 75% support. I think we're gonna get 2x wether you like it or not.
@_date: 2017-05-21 18:48:01
Congrats to you! I hope to get there in a couple of years.
@_date: 2016-05-25 19:29:12
What about blockchains?
@_date: 2016-05-25 19:21:40
Call me pessimistic, but I'm not confident the community will heal anytime soon. I don't think Bitcoin will die (and I wholeheartedly hope it survives), but rules of nature will continue to rule and things will work out in the end. The ideas and values that flourished with Bitcoin are here to stay, that's my opinion.
@_date: 2016-05-11 12:04:44
"Bitcoin - it's all about green candles."
@_date: 2016-05-25 19:24:13
On the other hand, the ideas that Bitcoin started are thriving quite well!
@_date: 2016-05-25 12:39:30
You are referring to this thread right?
@_date: 2016-05-25 19:23:17
Interesting view, I guess we'll wait and see :)
@_date: 2017-07-05 09:16:38
If every bank, large merchant (like Starbucks) and big company that uses Bitcoin hosts a full node, that would bring the node count to thousands. More than enough to support the network.
@_date: 2016-05-25 15:04:44
I think that if this community fails to heal itself and make up with it is not going to end well. I wish everyone best but I don't want to interact with people who get mad at any mention of an altcoin or a different point of view.
@_date: 2016-07-20 16:36:47
This post. So ugly.
@_date: 2016-05-25 16:51:56
Community is a set of individuals with common interest in this case. I am part of several communities and I really like being part of them.

That's what confuses me the most. As soon as any of those coins reach someone indentifiable, we should be able tontrace back to the thieves.
Edit: at least, that's how I understand it works.
@_date: 2016-07-22 06:25:05
I think that is the the primary and perhaps only motivation of ETHC. To sustain a failed fork enough to prove forks are dangerous.
@_date: 2016-07-25 05:59:16
How come this discussion is allowed on this subreddit?
@_date: 2016-07-09 10:54:18
Why are you publishing this as open source? If this algorithm is successful, isn't it in your selfish interest to keep it for yourself?
@_date: 2017-06-04 05:52:55
Want to save fees? Stop using transactions!
@_date: 2017-06-16 20:38:53
Everyone who thinks that Bitcoin's primary purpose is store of value, is driven by greed.
@_date: 2017-06-11 17:03:56
I have no problem with that
@_date: 2017-06-16 20:45:43
Not at the expense of not being able to transact at affordable fees.
@_date: 2016-07-20 15:47:50
SSShhhhh! You can only mention ETHHF here if it fails. If it succeeds, its obviously a forbidden topic. Go to that other btc subreddit.
@_date: 2017-06-23 12:54:27
Funny how people upvote it as great news but once they realize it's Ethereum write stuff like "of course they choose centralized Ethereum" [They didn't go with Bitcoin because we are too cypherpunk and free of centralisation]
@_date: 2017-06-11 17:03:55
