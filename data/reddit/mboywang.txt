Not sure if you really tried it. You CAN NOT deposit and withdraw right now.

Absolutely. Lots like: Yes, we should all use DOS 3.3, never upgrade, the windows GUI use too much guardian and ram, not everyone will be able to use it! it will destroy the chance for more people be able to use computer!

That is a good reason for merchant who doesn't care about the reputation. For most reputable, big merchant, customer happiness is way more important that irreversible transaction. When you pay cash in Walmart, whole foods, It is also irreversible, but they never prefer cash because it is irreversible.

I highly doubt that. What's the benefit for them to beg you? No enough usage for then even to invest in change the payment system.

It is better for the merchant, for sure. Bad for the consumer, for sure. I never even use my debit card if I could use my credit card since I know the credit card company will help me if something goes wrong later, there are so many other benefits as the points, insurance, purchase protection, increase my credit score etc. I would never use bitcoin for the transaction unless I could not use the credit card.

Being working at IT professional for last 20 years, hardware cost has never become the major concern of any serious project. And it becomes cheaper and bigger every month! I don't know about Bitcoin technology in depth. But when you can buy one of 6tb hard drive for $160 and per Bitcoin worth $4000, I really don't see why storage could become an issue. Also when I saw the argument about the bigger blocks size will make the raspberry pi not powerful enough to be a node. I was laughing. Seriously? A 70billiin market need to be supported by raspberry pi? You can't afford to spend $500 to buy an i7 from Walmart? 
Would love to hear more about this argument to prove I am wrong.

When people say bitcoin price will go up because the supply is limited, other people say a deflation system never will be able to support an ever-increasing economy, then bitcoin can be divided infinitely, therefore it will support whatever the size of economy, which means it could hyper-inflation and crash the economy, which one is it?

exactly, the saving on the potential chargeback vs the trouble to handle the pissed off customers, so not worth it.

I am not sure. Just like: Gold is infinitely divisible. If there was only one ounce of gold, the gold economy would still function exactly today.
