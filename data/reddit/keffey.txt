Difference is, I was referring to the people I've encountered NOT saying that it was the case for all members of any specific race. Because that would make me prejudicially ignorant.
It's funny you say that is this common sentiment held by Asians (maybe true but yet another generalisation) ...
Lol @ Dangerous... here's some facts:
A group of white people went to Asia with the intention of stealing its resources and colonising a large portion of it centuries ago, does that make ALL white people savages?? Or have they since evolved into more sophisticated beings?? 
No, it makes them equally as capable of savagery as any other member of the human race. I'm not surprised by sensationalised media coverage in heavily-censored communist states. Perhaps the said Asians have selective memory or a case of Stockholm syndrome? Lol who knows.
Degenerate people, exist in ALL colours my friend, you can disregard the history of the human race, in favour of bias.
and yes there exists a disproportionate amount of impoverished minorities that are criminals, due to demographics, opportunity or lack thereof in an imperviously caucasian dominated hierarchy... because history still has great baring on today's world.
The people most capable of ending the world tomorrow are predominantly white and a select few asians... with their nuclear warheads, who really poses a far more DANGEROUS threat to all humanity?

Yes if they can REMEMBER their 12-24 word seed (not difficult) they can travel light, I believe one's memory to be much safer than even pgp encrypted data on a usb hardware. Especially when surrounded by bandits.
Also if they can find a btc vendor in their own country, this can work.
@_date: 2017-02-19 12:36:44
No that's just you making a generalisation to simplify your perception of reality... I felt safe in Asia too, but that's because the criminals I did encounter are cunning in their cons, far more sophisticated, and usually non-violent.

There was a global economic crash in 2008, we are still using fiat and it's still inflating... but hey it may be a crap store of value but atleast we can transfer it instantly, while all being millionaires in zimbabwe.
Alot has changed since 2014, an exchange hack would not cause the same FUD today, what didn't kill btc clearly made it stronger + halvening.
Really we need skepticism and downwards pressure in order to eliminate the weak hands and allow for affordable adoption to new users.

It is impossible for any government entity to ban bitcoin, without banning the internet... If they make it illegal it will be more expensive. Think of drugs, guns etc. All they can do is impose controls on exchanges, very unfortunate that a decentralized currency is so heavily controlled by China.

There is NO such thing as a user activated hard fork... this is Jihan Wu trying to pull the wool over everyone's eyes.
First he rebranded segwit by putting 2x on the end.... now he is rebranding something that is essentially a miner activated hard fork.
Do not trust this bad actor, he is trying to sabotage bitcoin with his chinese cronies.

Hardware wallets facilitate cold storage, one example being trezor, allows you to store your private keys offline, thus providing much more security.

@_date: 2017-05-27 04:37:00
Bitcoin is a store of value.... less so a currency for daily usage, but that's subjective, maybe this is about accumulating wealth for future generations, a hedge against centralisation, then a short-term gain.
you're up 15%? Lol that's cute. I think you've missed the point, if your entry position was sub $500 and you sell, yes you're up... but you've lost your entry position and may never be able to get coins that cheap again.
Best of luck

Sending your coins to a Trezor and then writing down the 24 word seed is hardly rocket science.

Go and research the amount of times PBoC has "banned" bitcoin. The regulating of exchanges to stifle capital flight...

Or they can just sell @ 3k and then buy back the apocalyptic dip around Aug1st.... profit is the name of the game, not keeping the price high, which remains relative to one's entry point.
Once upon a time $30 was high, and it crashed to $2.
