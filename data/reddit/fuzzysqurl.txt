"Millennials" will probably end up "killing" it if that's the name used.

Well considering they're prohibited from being issued after 1982 and most from before then have been cashed out I doubt we will get anything with a recent precedent without asking someone that this specifically happened to, or someone well versed in US Tax Code. 
I know you can deduct unreimbursed stolen property losses if they exceed 10% of your adjusted gross income though, so if someone steals your BTC you could probably get some tax relief. What I don't know in this case if it would use the buying price or current market value to determine that deduction.

No, the point is for someone else to get it, not the guy who puts it there. 
Say you post on Facebook "first one to my house gets free pizza" but technically the first one to your house is the pizza delivery guy. He could then just take the pizza himself and your whole plan is worthless.

You could just hire a hitman** to take care of a subscriber then purchase their identity online and assume that person's life and identity. Easy access.
\*\*Make sure the hitman is good with puns. When they mortally wound your target they have to say something like "It looks like your condition is... *Terminal*"

When I bought on Coinbase awhile ago it let me lock in a price at the time of purchase despite the transaction taking over a week to clear completely (ACH). I had to pay minor fees but it allows you to buy in a dip at a moments notice as long as you have funds available in your bank account. Given how big some of these dips are you could easily out grow the fees. I think I paid around 1-2%.

On that same day LTC jumped like $8 (12%). Month to date LTC is a little slower than BTC. I bought like $10 for shits and giggles about a month ago so that's all I really know about it.

From my time in r/CrappyDesign I've learned that there are no rules to acronyms. As such, I have created my own meaning for HODL in the same vein. 
H- Support
O- The
D- Superior

More like, "Impossible, Finland doesn't exist."

Then how do you make batteries? Don't tell me there's a battery stork too.
