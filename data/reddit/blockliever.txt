Thanks for your reply! Good to know!
The  ATM I use has the QR thing on it, and that's actually the main reason I made the mistake. The first time I used it, the wallet automatically sent the exact amount after reading the QR. So the second time, I thought it would work the same; except this time, I used a different wallet (actually Coinbase), and just trusted the whole thing since it worked the first time. (I mean why whouldn't I trust it right? I am not that much of a tech guy either).
So yeah, thats what ended up happening.

To be honest with you, I didn't really do the math at the moment. I really needed cash and that was my only option. But if it helps, I sold  around 0.0065 BTC and received $2500 argentinian pesos, which means the exchange rate was about $388,802 ARS, or aprox $9150. I checked the price on coinmarketcap for that day and it was around $10,200. Might have been an expensive transaction, but then again, I paid $4,000 for it so I guess it depends on how you look at it.

Oh no, I'm not blaming Bitcoin for this! I'm blaming the ATM company! and yes I contacted them,  but of course they only give support Monday through Friday, so I'll have to wait until Monday to see if there is a way for me to get my btc back!

Really dude? 
You've got to realize that not every country is like the US.
Here, UBER is illegal, so you have to take a cab (you need cash for that).
Also, a lot of places do not take credit cards, and as I said, my debit card hasn't been working since I got here. 
So yes, I did needed cash and this was the only way (or at least the fastest and most convenient) to get it.

Hey everyone,
I am currently studying abroad in South America and have been travelling for the summer.
One of these nights, I needed to get some thin-air based fiat to take my beautiful girlfriend on a nice dinner. I went to an ATM to get some cash, but my bank's debit card hasn't been working well here so I was unable to get some. (It's also kind of hard to get a new card being here).
Thankfully, there was a Bitcoin ATM near us, and guess what: **IT WORKED!** (I had my girlfriend record the whole thing!)
I was able to exchange some of my precious satoshis for stinky fiat in a couple of minutes! Really once I confirmed the transaction on my wallet, the whole thing worked out super fast. I think it took longer for me to type the wallet password than for the ATM to release the cash.
I know this will end up being a very expensive dinner, but it was absolutely worth it! (I'll make sure to refill ASAP).
Anyways, just wanted to share this with you guys!!
**BITCOIN IS NOT GOING ANYWHERE**
**LONG LIVE BITCOIN**

A purpose does not necessarily have to do with your own life, and "critical" can be a very relative and subjective matter. What I have said does not exclude what you have said, I however, like to celebrate this small, but critical step.
