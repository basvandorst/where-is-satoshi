Yeah it’s called the Petro Dollar and is why the US does the bidding of Saudi Arabia, arguably one of the most dictatorial human rights violating countries on the planet. Instead of invading their country to seize their resources, we have the petro dollar agreement. We sell them weapons and also do their bidding, such as help them commit genocide in Yemen and overthrow the Syrian government. No one cares though, or even knows, when you have CNN, Fox, and MSNBC force feeding you bullshit sandwiches all day everyday.

Venezuela sits on one of the largest oil reserves in the world, second only to Saudi Arabia. They’re balling, they own Citgo for example, you may know this popular nationwide gas station. But Chavez and Maduro want to do this horrible thing of distributing the oil wealth to their poor population. That’s why the US is always messing with them, unlike the Saudis who oppress their people, and do things like sabotage their political and economic system.

Socialism is not horrible, IE Canada, UK, Germany, France, Scandinavia all have social programs that make American politicians heads explode. They are successful countries surpassing the US in almost every way. Venezuela is suppressed by the US and its cronies like the IMF, World Bank, and the CIA, for decades. This is because they sit on large oil reserves, only second to Saudi Arabia, and want to invest that wealth INTO THEIR POOR PEOPLE. This makes Capitalists heads explode and hence, the hegemony.

I disagree. I'm new as of June, so to speak, as I originally heard about bitcoin from Max Keiser and Rick Falkvinge a few years ago, but didn't take action.
If you listen to smart people in the space, such as Max, Rick, and the Winklevoss brothers, you would have heard them say that bitcoin will likely be on par with gold prices and possibly capture 10% of the FOREX market, which implies a price much higher than it currently is.
Also from a n00b chart analysis standpoint, the current trends do not look like April. Don't hate on the newbies man. You want bitcoin to succeed or do you just want to feel special?

Damn Bitcoin doesn't have to be perfect to work! We assigned a lot of value to shiny golden rocks for Christ sake didn't we?

I would say so, yes, in general. There might be some opportunity to buy right now. The market is dipping this weekend, not like the April crash, but it has hit around $260 twice in 24 hours from an ATH of around $360. Some say it may rebound back to $300s Tuesday after a bank holiday on Monday. There is no negative mainstream news of concern. Some say we might see a slow decline to $200 and stay there for a while.
If you believe that Bitcoin will exceed $400 one day, as do I, these low dips going on right now aren't a bad time to buy. I would buy something under $300 at least. If we continue a downward slide Tuesday, then wait for a stable low and buy more.
Avoid trading in bulk unless you're super confident and know what you're doing.

Time magazine propaganda BS. More exposure for BTC, though.

F all those rich kids. Just keep bringing the publicity our way and get lost.

I'm so sick of the fake war on terror.

Oh BRAVO BRAVO! But I'm poor and desperate, so I need the price to stay high. Also, no one is going to give a shit about Bitcoin, unless the price stays above $500.

F alt coins. They only dilute all the good going on with Bitcoin at the moment. LTC might become its silver in the future, but focus on Bitcoin.
Who the hell wants to use something called NAMEcoin or CHACKALAKKAcoin anyways?! Who came up with these doomed to fail names?!

Ok. Also don't use WeExchange (was part of now defunct BitFunder). They stole 1 BTC from me and countless others.

Chill out. Reddit is supposed to be fun and is the only reason I personally keep coming back here. Let the up and down votes decide. 
If you want serious, go to Bitcointalk.org. There's plenty of assholes over there you'll get along with nicely.
