You pay capital gains on whatever you sell into dollars.  15% capital gains on longer than 1 year. Just cash them out on a regular exchange and pay your taxes and no one will bother you.

Most people there have smart phones and internet. It was before Socialism, the most developed country in Latin America. But yes, they do use US dollars more just because it has much larger network effects. That isn’t to say Bitcoin hasn’t helped the people there. Bitcoin has still gone up compared to the Venezuelan currency. The guaranteed way to lose in Venezuela is to keep your money in local cash.

The debt is not paid for by treasury notes. That’s how the govt acquires the debt. So yes, the tax payer will have to pay for that some how because the buyer of the note has to be paid down the line. By taxes or inflation.

Lol that makes no sense. The economy is not a zero sum game. The amount of hours people can work is completely variable and can fluctuate for thousands if not millions of reasons. Your understanding of the economy and how it functions is rudimentary.
@_date: 2019-03-14 18:23:42
There is little to no evidence that any of your assertions are true. Poverty in both the U.S and the world has gone down dramatically in the last 5 decades. The average poor person in America qualifies as upper middle class on a global level. 
I want AI and Technology to destroy as many jobs as possible. That’s how society evolves and more wealth is created and enjoyed by EVERYONE. Will some people have to learn new jobs and skills? Absolutely. If they don’t want to, no one is going to force them. There will always be some low wage menial repetitive job they can do. To forcibly take money from other people to give to others is immoral. 
There are many jobs available in designing and coming up with new products in many industries. And you’re acting silly to think the only option people have is to “get a job.” Lots of inventors are independent entrepreneurs and start their own business. You should look into it.

False. The economy is not a zero sum game. Wealth is created and destroyed every single day. Fortunately, human society is creating much more wealth at an exponential rate. 
@_date: 2016-06-01 12:17:39
Most potential? In Venezuela, I don't think so.  
It is certainly one of the places where it would be most helpful. And I have pushed family there to buy it when they can. They even get a nice discount and if they buy BTC, they can immediately sell dollars at premium.

@_date: 2019-03-15 09:08:03
You are confusing wealth with money/currency.
Just because something has value, does not mean that  money has been created somewhere to account for that. That’s not how it works.
Money and currency is an abstract. It simply represents the value that we place on objects and facilitates trade. The wealth of human society does NOT equal the sum of money. It equals the SUM of objects and things we give a monetary value which includes money. 
Let say the wealth of the world equals $100 billion and at any one time we need 1/10 of that to be denominated in dollars to facilitate trade.
If the wealth of the world increases 10% we are at $110 billion and $11 billion in dollars. If we printed 1 billion dollars for that increase in demand for money, the price remains the same right. Demand and supply gets you price.
If we print more dollars than we need than the value represented by each dollar goes down. Over supply brings down the price of money. Like if we print 2 billion dollars when really only 1 billion dollars worth of wealth was created. The market takes that into account and each dollar buys you less stuff. 
With Bitcoin you have more and more wealth represented by units that don’t grow at the same pace. Demand is outstripping the supply. That is why the price of each Bitcoin has gone up so dramatically over time.

You can look it up yourself.  Go to Surbitcoin.  
The price is 580,000 bolivares for the Asks.  Now go to DolarToday.  The price for 1 dollar is 1,050 bolivares.  
580,000 / 1,050 = $552.38
I way overestimated how many you could get though. Probably 5-10 a day at the most on Surbitcoin without significantly moving the price.  Their just ain't too much demand.

Nope. This type of prediction about mass unemployment due to technology has been made since the dawn of the Industrial Age. 
What happens is that human labor is no longer devoted to menial repetitive tasks but instead jobs and careers where human ingenuity and creativity is required. Jobs that AI and automation could never do. Like starting businesses, design, invention, coding, etc, etc...
This is good as humans dedicate their time towards more wealth creating activities increasing the well being of all of society. 
The idea that UBI will be required is pushed by those pushing a communist ideology or those lacking the knowledge of both economics and history.

I second the debit card idea.  
I personally use Coinbase for my spend account and link it to my Shift Debit Card.  It holds it in BTC.  When I make a purchase anywhere VISA is accepted, it sells enough BTC at the market rate to cover the debit amount.  However, I keep most of my BTC in an account where I have the keys. On Coinbase, it's more like a bank account but still BTC.  
LocalBitcoins is your best bet to do sales in cash and meet someone in person.

People don’t understand that the Govt hands out sentences like it were candy. People think 2 years is short and compared to 20, sure, it is. But 2 years is 2 years without a job, family, your house gone, car gone, relationships destroyed, reputation destroyed, 2 years of shitty food, public showers, and living with bad people that don’t care much about anything or anyone.  Something they don’t tell you is that it’s depressing. For everyone. No matter how hard they are. 
The War on Drugs is a travesty. We’ve destroyed millions of families and lives and set our country back decades economically because of people making choices for themselves what they want to do with their body.

It seems you’re unaware that this type of mass job displacement has happened since forever and the predictions of doom and gloom have always failed to materialize. 
The 3.5 million truck drivers for example are not going to be displaced all at once. Some many never be displaced. It happens gradually as it’s economically feasible to do so. The truck drivers will see the writing on the wall and prepare themselves. It’s better in the long run for human society that we have people trained to really add value to our society instead of doing some job an AI can do.
@_date: 2018-10-19 04:21:46
This is just incorrect. You don’t pay tax when there is no gain. If he gets paid for a haircut when BTC is at $6,500 and then sells BTC when it’s at $6,500. There is no gain. Therefore there is no tax. 
He pays tax on income like he would with any income, cash credit or otherwise. 
Also, it’s not a guaranteed audit. Audits happen when the math doesn’t add up. If you’re honest. You most likely won’t have an audit. If money earned from Bitcoin + other revenue lines up with previous years. It’s not gonna send up any red flags at IRS.

I never agreed with the idea that Bitcoin is better than Fiat and the current banking system. Sure, it’s better than Fiat at certain things. Long term storage of value, making international payments with no questions asked, holding wealth in a way that cannot be seized. But in terms of everyday spending, Bitcoin is not ready and a hassle. I’d have to sell it for Fiat anyways, this is the most convenient method.
I’m happy to use Bitcoin on chain when the use case calls for it. That doesn’t happen very often.
And to criticize people for using Bitcoin debit cards as relying on the banking industry when Fiat exchanges are necessary and will likely always be necessary is just ridiculous.

Currency is a subset of money. You can’t be a currency without also being a money. 
A currency has three main characteristics.
Storage of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account. US Dollar clearly checks all three. Bitcoin checks two boxes. Bitcoin is clearly money. It is used as SoV, MoE, has divisibility, uniformity, scarcity and durability.  But it is not a unit of account.
@_date: 2019-10-23 13:49:11
It keeps 99% of its value over a year. It’s universally accepted. It’s just way more convenient for regular people to get paid and spend USD. And anybody of significant wealth knows about inflation and invest accordingly. 
It is absolutely a store of value. People aren’t worried if it drops 10% one day. Or one week. People just want stability.
@_date: 2018-06-28 12:56:16
When it’s more convenient for me to make an immutable transaction on chain. I’m happy to pay the network fees. But when my Bitcoin Visa card is more convenient, I’ll do it with that. 
My point is, the more convenient it is to use and spend Bitcoin. Whether it be on chain or off, with debit card or  whatever. The better it is for Bitcoin.
That people stigmatize how I spend it is silly and only hurts Bitcoin adoption.
@_date: 2019-10-23 09:50:38
“Very low” what? I mean yeah, USD gets inflated every year but compared to the rest of currencies out there. USD is clearly in the top tier of currencies/money for holding value.
@_date: 2019-10-23 14:13:00
The fact that it’s inflationary is why I have Bitcoin and stop scaremongering saying it will eventually go to zero. 1%-2% inflation is very manageable and most investments beat that over time. Even housing. People don’t just hold cash for decades.
I’m all for Bitcoin and it’s an impressive piece of technology but saying stuff like the US Dollar is not a storage of value and that it will go to zero just doesn’t convince anyone and makes you sound like a zealot. Most people would rather deal with 1%-2% gradual loss over a year on a small percentage of their wealth instead of dealing with volatile swings every day and dealing with buying and selling bitcoin to buy things.

It’s time for drastic action. People are seeing ridiculous fees for Bitcoin transactions when the blocks are being artificially limited by companies and wallets not doing what they are supposed to. It’s time to motivate them to increase the block size by adopting SegWit. The users are in control here.
What does it say about Bitcoin that as a network we are constantly letting the network be under a spam attack. This is BS. It’s time to do something about it.

Charlie knowingly sold Bitcoin to someone who told him explicitly he was going to use it for illegal purposes. It’s one thing to openly buy and sell Bitcoins and what your customers do with it later is not your responsibility. But when they tell you beforehand it is your responsibility. Even Charlie admits he screwed up there. Sure Charlie was a pioneer for Bitcoin. But their is nothing about running an exchange which requires it to aide illegal activities such as money laundering. Even when Bitcoin existed in its early days.
@_date: 2017-09-25 01:11:29

@_date: 2017-09-24 19:14:52
Exactly.  It has always been both and will be both.  How many people got into Bitcoin because they were able to use it as a payment method or accept it as a payment method? Too many to count. It's time that small blockers realize this also.  But let's be clear that SegWit and small blocks don't stop Bitcoin from being used as the payment system it is today.

If it gets to the point where Amazon is getting so many additional orders to be a problem for the BTC network, they’d add lightning themselves. It’d be in their benefit to do so if we’re talking about as many transactions per second that’s it’d be a problem.
@_date: 2017-09-24 19:58:23
It holds a Bitcoin balance. It only converts into FIAT at the POS and only enough to cover the purchase. It’s perfectly usable for micro transactions. I didn’t have to wait for Lightning.

Most people are using the dollar to store wealth not Bitcoin. Only the tech savvy internet users are using Bitcoin really. Even my cousin who I’ve told about Bitcoin, is younger than me and whatever, can’t be bothered to learn it. But both my cousins have USD bank accounts and use that. My family here just ACH transfers dollars to their account and they sell them electronically as well. 
I’m surprised Bitcoin hasn’t caught on more but honestly it’s due to the steep learning curve to using Bitcoin than lack of technology/infrastructure. Most people have a smart phone and internet access to be able to use BTC. Just more retailers don’t accept it.

What does it matter? It’s a layer 2 solution provided by a third party. A popular exchange is where I have my debit card. They sell my BTC for me at the point of sale so I keep a balance in BTC. It’s kind of like a bank, I know. But I have the convenience of using BTC wherever VISA is accepted. Seems like a fair deal to me. And they don’t charge me any fees except if I withdraw cash. I keep most of my BTC on my hardware wallet.

That there are lynchings of govt supporters and criminals is true. No one is denying that. Do you know why?
Because there is NO justice in Venezuela. There is NO Rule of Law. The people are angry at the lack of justice. The govt is absolutely inept and corrupt. Even the New York Times reporting has shown this. You cant just link one or two specific cases of violence towards govt supporters and ignore the hundreds of people who have died due to govt repression and the thousands that have been jailed and are still in jail only because of political reasons. 
Look at these headlines from Human Rights Watch.
“FAO, PAHO Statistics on Increasing Hunger in Venezuela”
“Jailed for Photographing the Health Crisis”
“Jailing a Legislator’s Brother”
“Opposition Mayor Behind Bars”
Here is a compilation of Venezuelan oppression of protestors.
VenezuelAnalysis is pure paid propaganda site. And I am not surprised a Chavista Govt supported was robbed at home. THAT HAPPENS TO EVERYONE. 
CRIME IS RAMPANT! The government has failed at every level to engorce the Rule of Law because Diosdado Cabello could very well be the head of the Cartel de Los Soles. He is a narco. 
Look up crime in Venezuela statistics. Look up YouTube videos on people visiting Caracas asking regular people how many times they have been robbed. It is a common occurrence. 
You are BLIND to the truth of what is going on in Venezuela because it does not conform to your socialist/communist beliefs. Sorry to tell you, they are just totalitarian incompetents with socialists leanings. They are corrupt and they are willing to jail political opposition on bogus trumped up charges. 
Just look at YouTube at the size of protests for the opposition. Look how many countries think that the Venezuelan govt cheated in the election for the Constituent Assembly.
You literally don’t know about the subject. You literally don’t know what’s going on. You see a few articles that confirms your view and your happy. Look deeper. This govt will close down news channels, jail opposition, kill protestors. Look up Manuel Sosa. He wasn’t paid. He went out there fighting for his liberty. He left a kid behind. He was just one of hundreds of students. 
Open. Your. Eyes.

I very much dislike labeling what you are talking about inflation/deflation since most of the time in economics, it is not used in that context. It is much clearer to say money supply growth or money supply decrease. Then the meaning is crystal clear.

Nope, that’s wrong. The common way inflation and deflation is used is to describe pricing.

Prices for good in Dollars have gone up = Inflation.

The goal of devaluing the currency is not to increase exports. That wouldn't really help all that much. The goal of devaluing the currency is to lower the debt. You still owe the same amount of drachma, but because it's worth less, it's easier to pay off and the debt is more manageable.

@_date: 2016-05-14 16:18:41
I use Shift because it connects to my coinbase account and it's like the only one in the U.S.
It converts the charge from USD into BTC at the current market rate of the hour on coinbase and doesn't charge any fees for debit transactions. 
Up to $1,000 a day in spending allowed.

But don't we have the blockchain and shouldn't that have all the addresses on it? 
@_date: 2016-05-20 22:17:39
From my experience working as a bank teller. Keep the transactions under $3,000.  Banks don't have to report anything under that number unless it's suspicious. By suspicious, I mean, the customer acts strange, is nervous, the transaction is out of ordinary, sounds like a scam....
Over $3,000 they don't have to report unless you act in a suspicious way. The transaction itself should not be an indication of suspicious activity. 
Multiple transactions in a day would definitely get picked up.  
At $10,000 they have to file a report. 
That being said, you can get a Shift Debit Card for $10 and connect it to your Coinbase account. I like Coinbase and Gemini.  You can hold in USD, BTC, or ETH on both. And If I were you, I would diversify. $20,000 in USD, $20k in BTC, and $10k in ETH. 
I would withdraw 2.5k every two weeks.  You can take your time. No reason to rush.  
@_date: 2016-05-15 23:50:58
Depends on your definition on inflationary. All I care about are prices. Are prices going up or down? 
If ETH is inflationary than prices denominated in ETH with rise. Eth is still young but it's price history to date suggests that it is not. 
@_date: 2016-05-11 13:52:18
So what? My BTC are still as good as yours. If it costs you .25 BTC to make a transaction it cost me just the same.  
If I wanna move them I can, sell them I can, spend them I can. They are mine.  
@_date: 2016-05-06 13:41:10
I think my Shift card makes me much more risk adverse with my BTC and makes it more accessible and convenient for use as well.  
I really like that it links to my already existing Coinbase account.  For others BitPay may be a great choice.  It allows for a higher cash withdrawal in a day.  
I really think BTC is here for the long term, but I hedge all my bets. Having an account that can switch from BTC back to USD almost instantly is advantageous and protects me. I don't have to worry about if my wealth is secure, I can cash out quickly.  
BTC is on a long term growth trend but has high variation.  By cashing out at peeks and buying at lows, one can increase how much money one has. And by being able to spend my BTC with a VISA anywhere is just great.  I spend the BTC I want at the market rate. What other currency/commodity can I do that with NO cost? 
The only con is that it is not anonymous.  That doesn't bother me. But I can see why it would others.

Doesn't matter how short or long a timeframe you are thinking of.  
In your example price didn't go down because of hodlers. it went down because demand was "very weak." The supply curve remained the same. Hodlers don't change the demand curve. If you take the same example and tell me that more people are selling, wouldn't lower the price more? That's the variable that matters.  
I'm not saying you need to make it a major factor in your assessment, I'm just pointing out that the level of people hodling affects the supply curve, which in turn affects price. 
@_date: 2016-05-30 10:32:35

Ethereum is not a scam. It is just a newer crypto currency with more features. It compliments Bitcoin so that is a good thing.
Coinbase is not a bad wallet. You don't have access to your own private key but that doesn't mean you don't have security. 
Every wallet/storage has pros and cons.
There is a book on Amazon that compiled everything Satoshi wrote online.

True... 100 years is a lot.  With so many option for wallets and apps for BTC. It's almost overwhelming.

How do you send the money back? 
@_date: 2016-05-15 19:14:13
Standard at Vox actually.  Nothing they do is particularly insightful. All they do is plagiarize wikipedia and other sources and package it up nicely.

Why would I demonize Satoshi? He was brilliant and a man of vision. And that vision never included the centralization of mining.

Who cares about income inequality when everyone's income is increasing?! You think the guy in Africa living off $2 a day is gonna care that his income is now more "equal" when it didn't increase at all or even goes down? No. He only cares if it goes up which is what Globalization has encouraged.
Honestly, you don't care about making poor people better off, you just want to see the rich be poorer. Cause that's the only way you're gonna get income "equality."
Globalization has made more people better off than at any other point in our history. Don't let yourself be fooled by socialists including economists who scream "income inequality."
Because right now a poor person in America has more wealth than Nelson Rockefeller did in 1916. And people are complaining.... Even blaming the forces that have helped Billions of people. 
Lol "streamed the process of exploitation" sounds like Marxism.

This is why I like Gemini. 
I deposit $400 and I type $400 and it gives me $400 of BTC calculating the fees for me which are low. 
What I like most is if it's ACH. You can buy instantly you just have to wait for it to clear to move money off the Gemini account. 
@_date: 2016-07-26 23:46:07
Vitalik actually admitted to not including replay protection on purpose!! Because they were rushing the code for the hard fork.

First off, I just really want to say that I really like the use of positive and negative feedback loops in your OP.  I feel you'd really enjoy looking into complexity economics if you haven't already.  
I like how you used math to find an easy solution to finding the average price. I agree with your main conclusion that dollar cost averaging is good for price stability. But I disagree with some statements.  


Hodling lessens the supply which in turn raises the price.  If more people hodl than before than ipso facto the supply curve has changed.  
Consider the extreme case. If no one decided to hold and everyone is selling, imagine what the price might be?

I wouldn't say that by itself causes a bubble.  To play devil's advocate, it could be seen as an efficient way to use the money that is gonna sit there anyway.  
To me what causes bubbles are govt regulations that distort the market.  Like the Housing bubble was cause by govt entities pushing for more ownership and letting people with no business buying a home get one.  
Some of it can be psychological as well. Like the Dot Com bubble. Prices got out of control cause we just didn't know how to value some of the companies.

It's called Fractional Reserve.  
When you put $100 in the bank. They will only hold around 10% of it in their accounts and lend the rest.  They also do this for everyone else. That's why if everyone went to the bank to withdraw at the same time, the bank would run out of money and crash. 
Most of the time this isn't a problem and most people keep most of their money in the bank and we have lots of measures to protect ourselves such as FDIC insurance, etc, etc, But sometimes it isn't which is why we have financial crises.

Nobody but the government and Chavistas think the U.S is doing anything to destabilize Venezuela. The Venezuelan govt never provides any proof for such allegations of which this is one of hundreds. There have been assassination attempts, multiple coups, economic war... etc.. etc.. in the end, everyone there starving due to their socialist corrupt policies. 
@_date: 2019-05-31 22:10:35
Props to you for being able to admit that. ���� Most people on Reddit can’t.

What I like most is that BTC is sold only when you buy something. So if it's $5.30 it will only sell the equivalent amount of BTC to cover it. 
A lot of other ones you "load." Which is no different than selling a batch of BTC and moving the money back to your bank account just faster.

You don’t have to be a no coiner to see what is obviously true. I completely agree with his post. He’s absolutely right and I also believe in Bitcoin and that it can be a better solution. But right now, for undocumented workers using cash. WU is better.

Yes, it’s going to go lower.

Regarding bitsquare.io
How do you send and receive Fiat?
@_date: 2019-05-31 21:42:19
I don’t see governments banning mining for precious metals which is perfectly legal. There will always be companies that mine it when it’s economically feasible to do so and they should be allowed to do it.
@_date: 2016-07-04 05:39:10
The govt can tax or create money. It is much more healthy for the economy for the govt to tax and spend the money that already exists.  
However, the govt has the advantage in that it can never default on it's debts (usually). Because it can it can just print the money to pay it back.  That's what the govt uses new money for. Paying back debs it couldn't pay back otherwise.
The more a country spends and borrows, the higher inflation goes... for example Venezuela. The creation and increase in the money supply is large because that is how Venezuela is paying for the govt to function.  
 
@_date: 2018-12-04 13:14:29
It’s not easier. First they have to have Bitcoin. They didn’t get paid in Bitcoin.
Many times they are undocumented workers. It’s not easy to open a bank account with no papers. Not to mention there are a lot of people that don’t want them anyway. Opening an exchange account for them is very difficult, if not impossible. 
Even LocalBitcoins is doing KYC now. Then these people that are poor and not tech savvy have to learn how to secure Bitcoin properly first in order to send it. 
Then the person receiving the Bitcoin also has to have some Fiat-BTC exchange set up in order to use it.
That you think it’s easier shows you have no concept of how difficult it is to use crypto sometimes.
@_date: 2018-12-04 13:16:22
Agreed. I don’t think anyone is disputing that. Just that WU is obviously easier for migrants today.

Or you can try the Shift card and link it to your coin base.

Bitcoin has only been around for less than 10 years in its entirety. To put that in perspective, the movies No County for Old Men, Superbad, and American Gangster are slightly older by one year.

Because they want to try NOT to print the money. That's bad for the economy and they know that.  It doesn't do them any favors to debase the currency to the point of high inflation.

It’s not really in Coinbase’s power to recover this right? It had to have been the user’s Bitcoin address and he had the private key and since Litecoin just copied the formatting, the address and key is the same on the Litecoin blockchain, Coinbase never had that info. Only the user.

Go ahead and try to arbitrage it.... I’ll wait....
It’s not trading for any higher there realistically. The BTC price is just a more accurate reflection of the local currency’s value. 
I wouldn’t trust black market statistics or statistics from the government there. 
@_date: 2016-07-06 19:39:20
Yes, there is a big discount on Surbitcoin but there's not that much liquidity either.  I doubt you could get 5 BTC under $675 even at the black market rate.
