Both appear to be the same screenshot of your notifications. Great, constructive feedback on the app though.

With the SegWit2x fork coming up, most of the Google searches trying to get more info on this were dominated by that. Do you know off the top of your head some of the major exchanges that support SegWit that people should know about?

Hence asking for some more information to better understand. If you want mainstream adoption, you're going to need people to have a better understanding of a highly technical concept that is over the head of most people.
Since it sounds like you are very smart, you could maybe help be part of the solution to spread helpful information...or ya know just be a condescending dick.

I'll be the first to admit that I do not fully understand all of the nuances with increases in block size, segwit, lightning network, etc. and what that means for Bitcoin and it's usability. I will say though that I have been buying and using Bitcoin since it was in the $200s and was used to sending relatively large sums of money quickly, and for pennies.
I understand that now Bitcoin is more popular than ever and the mempool has more transactions that need to be processed and confirmed than ever, but in its current state it is just not usable. I know I'm not alone, but I have had a transaction pending for over a hour that now costs nearly 100x more than it used to cost to send, and takes much longer to get a single confirmation due to all of these factors.
I am a firm believer in Bitcoin and crypto-currencies, and the value they have the potential to bring. That said, can someone ELI5 what is on the roadmap to help alleviate these issues as a I am not a developer/programmer?

Got it, thanks. What can everyday users of Bitcoin do to help influence big exchanges to adopt SegWit to help with this in your opinion?

Oh ok why didnt I think of that. So no help on how the function built into Bitcoin that allows you to "time lock" your funds works and can be used with a Ledger Nano S?
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:19:50
Yeah that's what I am doing now. Cost is negligible but just another thing to keep up with and pay a bank for. The "time lock" stuff I was reading about sounded like an interesting and free alternative, but was very technical when it came into how to implement.

TBQH this sub has become obnoxious. It used to be a place you could actually get information about Bitcoin. I have done quite well with Bitcoin and investing in general.
While I am glad to hear it sounds like you are a model investor and have self control in all aspects of your life, I came here to learn about a feature coded into Bitcoin that allows you to "time lock" your coins that I heard about yesterday. Given the volatility of Bitcoin lately combined with my desire to hold my remaining coins long term anyways, this sounded like an interesting feature I hoped to learn some more about.
It doesn't sound like you have any relevant information to add, so I can't imagine why someone like yourself would jump into a comment thread.

I have taken some profits along the way and done nicely, but I'd like to not think about panic selling the rest and getting stressed out by the daily fluctuations. Really the only reason it's actually stressful at all is because I have to make decisions on a daily basis about holding/selling because everything is right at my fingertips, even though I plan to hold long term.
I have heard that there are ways to "time lock" your Bitcoin though, and this is something I am interested in. Does anyone have any information on a safe way to do this using a Ledger Nano S where I could theoretically lock myself out of having access to my Bitcoins for the next 2 years?
At that point I feel like there would be little to no stress because worrying about it would accomplish nothing and I've locked myself in for the long term hold and no chance of panic selling.
