It would be the 71st time Bitcoin has died then.

Volume is actually 325,5 BTC so far.

Saw this reply the same question on another site: 
"We do not disclose our addresses at this point in time, but our holdings are audited by Price Waterhouse and we are thinking of a good way of disclosing holdings without compromising security. Please read our policy below for safekeeping of bitcoin holdings.
    We issue ETNs in the order book in the market continuously and have no upper limit. At this point in time we hold around 2400 btc corresponding to the liabilities we have to the holders of the ETNs sold yesterday, today and in a small private placement.
    We never take any market risk but hedge all exposure. We are also guaranteed by KnCGroup.
    We and our market maker will make sure that there is a liquid market on Nasdaq at all times. A few arbitrageurs will also start trading the ETN

    Policy for safekeeping of bitcoin assets
    In order to safe keep bitcoin assets, the board of XBT Provider have decided on a secure multi-layer process for handling and safekeeping bitcoins.
    In order to hedge exposure to the returns of bitcoin, XBT Provider will hold bitcoins. A small part of the holdings can be kept on bitcoin exchanges, if deemed necessary additional coins can be held on a multi-signature hot wallet and all holdings over a threshold must be kept in safe storage according to the limit and methods disclosed below. All changes to this policy must be approved by the board.
     
    Limits
        Assets kept on individual bitcoin exchanges cannot be in excess of 1000 btc.
        The total of assets kept on exchanges cannot exceed 4000 btc
        The total of assets kept on exchanges and internal multi-signature hot-wallets cannot exceed 6000 btc or 10% of assets, whichever is largest. All remaining assets must be kept in safe storage.
        At least 90 percent of bitcoin assets (except if assets are very small as defined above)) must be kept in safe storage.
     
    Safe Storage
    At the latest when the above mentioned limits are reached XBT Provider will send bitcoin holdings to its safe Bitcoin address using P2SH (Pay to script hash) transactions. This way the company can send funds easily to a safe address while not disclosing any information regarding the receiving address or security precautions surrounding the private or public keys related to the address.
     
    In order to access bitcoins on the secure address at least three out of five private keys needs to be used in conjunction in order to access any funds. Private keys will be kept at devices built specifically in order to store private keys in a safe way. The devices are also protected with a pin-code. The devices will be held by key shareholders and company executives separately in separate bank vaults.

It'll be interesting to see when international banks and brokerages, Bloomberg terminals etc, get access (they are slow to update their lists it seems). So far it's mainly only available on Nordnet and Avanza in Sweden.

It's just a logical result from how the Bitcoin protocol works. As competitors race towards the next reward the bitcoin mining processors can start guessing on the next block before its memory can be filled with transactions to create a full block (takes several seconds in many instances, if the miner is validating). 
So they all do this guessing while collecting and sorting blockchain data, of course. This does not affect the capacity of the network and it's nothing new, and it auto-adjusts its difficulty anyways.

Right now those two pools control 64.9%... yeah, and they said Ethereum was pool-resistant. Nothing is pool-resistant.

A battery-powered drone would be a very bad place to run an ASIC...

Big misunderstanding regarding mining; it won't be done on IoT, it'll be done by pros, with their pro-ASICs in big farms close to the cheapest electricity sources.

They can classify it anyway they want, Bitcoin does not care.

It would be really troublesome to have to connect that hardware box to my mobile phone when I want to leave the house and still use Twitter and those paywall websites. Just stupid.

"XBT Provider do not have any market risk. The company always hold bitcoins equivalent to the value of ETNs issued."

Network is fine. What 2-day backlog? Mempool is looking as healthy as usual.
@_date: 2015-09-24 10:56:27
Yes, that's true and great (!). I was thinking more on decentralization and "voting rights", which won't be much affected by this solution.

There is no fatal flaw, Bitcoin is humming along nicely.

It's also available at Nakamoto Institute (if you don't want to pay to read)!

Well, these custodians are just banks, don't use them. Learn how to use bitcoins! Get a real wallet, read about paper wallets, cold storage. Start off with something simple like Breadwallet on iOS or Bitcoin Wallet on Android, write down your 12-word seed (back-up) and you are ready to go... Oh, and it's free too!
