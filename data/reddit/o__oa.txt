A negative opinion is not toxic. People are allowed to have negative views. I'm a long term hodler and I agree with OP. Bitcoin is fucking stupid right now. But I don't see it as always being stupid, but in the current moment, it is. The communities are stupid, the divide is stupid, bitcoin is currently stupid. But it won't always be stupid.

Doesn't look like anything to me.

Segwit controversy is fluid! It's a spectrum of stupid!

Use localbitcoins to sell, live off cash to stay under radar. Don't get crazy with lavish shit, you don't need a fucking mansion or rolls royce. Maintain basic job to justify living expenses. Vacations, dining out, home luxury items can be done with cash.
Your investment is hodling and selling only when you need to.
Edit: Thinking about it more, would you rather be holding 5 million in investments where a govt can freeze your assets if they should decide to, or 5 million in btc where you retain control as long as you have the keys?

You say this as if you assume your holdings of bitcoin won't also increase in value.

This sounds like something the ADA might cover somehow. Though I'm not disabled and don't know enough about it to be certain. They may be required to provide you some alternative solution.
Though, you could always get a friend to assist you, but then that leaves your financials in a less than totally secure state since you must allow them to interact with Coinbase on your behalf.
Contact coinbases' support and ~~get ignored like everyone else~~ see if they'll work something out with you.

Oh, get a job? Just get a job? Why don't I strap on my job helmet and squeeze down into a job cannon and fire off into job land, where jobs grow on jobbies?!”

On coinbase, under settings, then security, you can see who last logged into your account.
Also, your title is retarded.

TL:DR - Conspiracy theorist level shit, no evidence.

I'll take "How to make me leave Coinbase and request them to delete all my info" for $500, Alex.

No one was really even talking about it until after the majority of the crash happened. cryptos are tied to btc so when btc goes down, it takes everyone else with it for the ride.
the hoax was never even that, it was stupid and had no effect.
