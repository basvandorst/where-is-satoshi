Right? I was talking to my dad about it all, and he related it to stocks. “Its all technically worthless until its sold”. I mean I guess with bitcoin you can buy some things but still, its something to think on. You could have a million and one bitcoin but until you sell them its just a big bunch of 1’s and 0’s.

I believe that Bitcoin will remain, but only because it was ‘the first’. Someone, sometime will develop a crypto that is simply better. It will be the one that pushes the world into a new digital age, but it wont be bitcoin, solely because its been here too long. Its built a history for itself, and not exactly a good one either. It will not disappear; its too cemented for that. Instead, it will fade into legend, being referred to as “ah yes, the bitcoin days. I remember them. Good times.”
Just my train of thought.

It wont exist any longer. A better digital currency will appear, one that is accepted basically everywhere. A universal currency that is globally known and traded for in the rusted tin huts of the post-apocalyptic wasteland dwellers after the nuclear war that we all can feel coming.

Would a hardware wallet be considered a financial institution? If I bought coins in say coinbase but then moved everything to Exodus on my hard drive or into a hardware wallet, would this still be counted as needing to inform the government? Because then everyone will just shove coin into a flashdrive and be like “yo nah I got nothing”

Im relatively new to bitcoin. Did a bit last summer when it was around 3000, but only went from $12-$50. My mistake. Whats the difference between exodus and coinbase? I kind of understand the wallet logic behind it, but if I wanted to start with exodus, how would I go about moving what I have in coinbase into exodus? Does it work like that? A few months ago I thought bitcoin was something people with powerful computers mined for for fun, but now...well now I hate few-months-ago me, like everyone else it seems.

Thanks! This is very helpful. Im in an apartment and so am paying one solid fee for electricity no matter what I use so I figured mining might as well happen, but it’s a lost hope, really. 
Again, thanks! Its always nice to find interneteers who arent douchebags.

So, Im kind of new to the in-depth view of bitcoin. What does the hardware wallet store? And how would I access what’s in it? I get that there are keys and such for your accounts, but I guess I just dont know what a ‘bitcoin wallet’ actually is, in the digital world. Is it a collection of addresses? Is it a full account of some bitcoin program? I never realized bitcoin was this thoroughly.....thorough.

Thanks, thats a pretty concise answer! A few followup questions, if you dont mind:
Does the hardware storage generate a new key each time its plugged in? What if I try to send coins to the hardware address when it isnt plugged into a machine? Does it store it software side somewhere until it is plugged in?
What is the best way to get coins? I have a very small amount right now, and I want to build my wallet of course, but mining takes ages with my equipment and buying doesnt seem to have much of a profit margin at this point, especially when working with as small of quantities as I am, starting out. What do you prefer?
Sorry if I seem completely unknowledgeable about stuff that may be simple, but I am pretty much completely unknowledgeable.
