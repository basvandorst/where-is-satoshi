Of course I saw this part of your interview:


I was hoping you could go into more detail about how colored coins would be a solution that would allow technologically-unsavvy event organizers sell tickets at auction without having to pay a third-party (except for the currency transfer from USD to coins and back). I suppose you're not at the white paper stage yet.

Sorry, another question. Ticketmaster's auction service has been in existence since at least 2006, when the first all-auction concert was hosted through that service. What do you see as the barriers that are preventing event organizers and venues from adopting this format over the past 8 years?

Ticketmaster already has a ticket auction service for event organizers and venues. In what ways would your potential solution be better than Ticketmaster's?

So, for many people, [very hard](

It does not look like it does pay for you to heat your apartment with ASICs. It is a nice bonus in the winter that may help recoup your capital investment cost a bit faster, if you are already mining, but you *have* to account for the cost of your miner, which you mention but don't actually do.
You are paying for the capital equipment cost of your electric, oil, or gas heater through your rent payment even if you are not using it.

How can bitcoins be considered an effective medium of exchange when the value of a bitcoin against any measure (not fiat currency, but actual goods) fluctuates so much? Why should any smart person start exchanging in bitcoins right now?

So the article's prediction that you are going to destroy the secondary market is actually incorrect? Your company's plan is to facilitate the secondary market of ticket scalpers?

Do you mean when [Jeff Ownby, VP of Marketing at Butterfly Labs, lied to borderpatrol]( in order to buy buttcoin.org?

Great point, they should be using some kind of one-stop-shop that will *master* the *ticket* auction process for them. For a fee, of course.

They can order a cellphone and set up a website the same day if we pay our foreign staff in bitcoin, but not buy food and pay their rent? Is this really the claim we're using to prove that Bitcoin is superior to fiat-to-fiat remittances?

The bitcoin foundation bylaws already contain a necessary and sufficient procedure for refusing or rejecting any member you want. Have you read Section 3 of your bylaws, including Section 3.4 the powers of the Executive Director to approve membership and Section 3.6 on how to terminate any membership?
I sit on the executive board of a non-profit, and I know it can be a lot of work, but understanding your bylaws, including getting advice from a lawyer, is crucial to any non-profit. Giving the board the power to terminate someone's membership is not cronyism, it's an example of how trust functions. Donors trust your board to make these kinds of hard decisions. If they don't trust your board or agree with your decisions, they stop donating or volunteering. It really is that simple.

And don't say 'fees' because regular fixed-price tickets have fees, too :)

Bitcoin must perform "exactly like" the incumbent when remitting because that is the world we live in. Can Filipinos and Canadians alike buy their groceries and pay their bills exclusively in Bitcoin? sure is acting like they can.

I think it's safe to assume this wasn't, like, a medieval wooden crossbow, but [a modern recursive or compound bow]( These are very popular for hunting certain game.

My parents what? They certainly had to approve the account and co-sign but parental oversight of children's spending accounts seems like a positive, not a negative.

Why can't she get a bank account or a debit card? I had a savings account with a linked debit card when I was around that age.

At this point hoping to profit off trading Bitcoin isn't investment, it's speculation. Maybe Bitcoin is a safer speculation other currencies, but I don't tend to speculate on currencies in the first place.

It's an "advanced topics" class [for graduate students]( meaning that the topic changes from semester to semester depending on the research projects of the professors.
