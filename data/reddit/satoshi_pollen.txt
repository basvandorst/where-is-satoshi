Bitcoin is challenging the monetary system and should inherently challenge the patriarchy nature of global finance too.

Thanks for your comment. I'm the person behind this project (pre-production and post). 
Your comment re the narrative:
"start off with a bad tone for bitcoin; not critical enough of Mpesa in the first half;"
This is actually the exact step I purposely took when cutting the footage. Your comment shows your understanding of my choices and I think we should both appropriate that.
Second comment for choice of final story-telling
"No mention of bitpesa?"
Elizabeth, the founder and CEO of BitPesa has a major role in my final choice of footage and in my overall research of Bitcoin 'on the ground'.
"It would be MASSIVE if we had a full feature docu, with beautiful infographic animations with lots of stats"
We're working on one IamSatoshi. We will attempt raising enough money to have more time to cut and Post-production budget.
Thanks!

You UL your music (must have copyright), the more it is shared, the more micro bitcoins you get. If your 'fans' get shares, they get micro payments too. So, it is in their interest to share your tunes. Super distribution - awesome idea

Unfortunately not. Some speakers provided slides and they can be found on the conference blog.

I thought this interview was important to bring to mind due to everything that is happening with Gottfrid Svartholm Warg in Denmark. And the bitcoin implications.

It's a good presentation and, the fact the price went down (mostly due to speculations and positions), will most likely go away sooner than we think. China out (for now), means more opportunities for Korea/Taiwan/HK/Singapore.
