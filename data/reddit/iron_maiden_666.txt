This cannot be true surely? I haven't been to a Starbucks but armed guards would be too over the top. I don't see anything like that in front of KFC or Burger king.

Are you daring to be doxxed?

Fear, uncertainty, doubt. 
Thank Bill Gates for that.

We all in some deep deep shit. If 2008 was bad, I don't want to know what happens when the world loses trust in USD.

Inverter with a big battery connected to important systems (TV, lights, fans, computers) and it lasts for a few hours depending on usage.

Dude, someone ate a dick because of their word. We need more people like that. Not the dick eating part, the following through part.

The 2 highest value notes were withdrawn, not small denominations.

For you.
For me they are pretty high.

Nah, US will put sanctions on them. We tried that already in India.

Tulip bulbs get mentioned in any investment thread where people are referring to past performance. Be it stocks, mutual funds, real estate or Bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:10:43
SR is what got me interested in Bitcoins.

Because it was fabricated govt bullshit and didn't stick in court. They needed to show this guy "is not an angel" and it stuck in people's minds.

He was never convicted for that. And the general consensus was it was faked to make him look bad. I don't know if the phrase "parallel construction" is relevant here, but it was used a lot in his hitman topics. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:04:20
Didn't even go to court that case. He was never convicted of that.

Criminal negligence. Giving out loans without due process.
@_date: 2017-07-09 00:36:33
Uhh but banks are not people. They have my money which they are giving out to people who can't repay their loans. That is not ok. Have you heard of fiduciary duty?
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:07:02
Never convicted for that. Most likely a fake case to push his bad guy image in the news. 
@_date: 2016-07-22 17:13:16
He had money for lawyers. 
@_date: 2016-07-22 17:10:22
It was pretty obvious.

Hong Kong and Singapore, no?

They are still using a .com address, I don't know how not dealing with US citizens helps them. If the US gov or NSA or anyone wants to track/monitor them, I'd assume they will be able to get a warrant because the top level domain is still controlled by an US company.

There was an AMA a few months ago by a cleaning lady if you want more info.

No, there was a discussion on about this too. They use multiple inputs to generate random numbers and RDRAND happens to be one of them. It's not the only one. 
Here is Linus Trovalds response to the use of RDRAND in Linux.

India has 22 (or so official languages). Get your facts right.

If you owe me 500K (let's say this number is inaccurate, even at 50% it doesn't make sense), why would I settle for 150K from someone else to knock you out?
