Who cares what one person or group thinks?
Only important is what majority think!
For now majority thinks that is bad idea of making bitcoin's infrastructure only big players game.

Why using word BAN?!?! Who bans what?!?!
How can anyone bans Bitcoin?  What means ban Bitcoin?
Is state say that their national currency is only currency which can be used for business does not mean that other currencies are banned.
Anyhow... "they" have ban torrent long time ago... and today no one is using it...  yeah.. right ;)

Just one thing as one smart man said - nothing can upset me except human stupidity.
Technology is unstoppable!
They succeed that with Tesla, but now we are all connected!

I really do not get why have I deserve those words from you, and you think you can do that it is ok, because as Ford said once “Whether you think you can, or you think you can't--you're right.”

Helló fiú, Újvidék származom :)
First, as most of the experienced people wrote you need to learn basics.
Peer2peer, blockchain, digital signature, API, RPC, crypto, etc... then try to understand what this technology represents for humanity. If you understood all of that you will be released of any chance for greed involving in the development of your mind.
If you choose programming, which I see as your logical choice, don't be fooled by others but do your own research and you will see that most of the advanced coins and most of the old get rewritten in the language which was designed exactly for needs of network infrastructure. There is a reason why most Python programmers went to that programing language.
Just do your research and get the basics of networking and Unix and you will be lead to that language just by following "the guys". ;)
And remember don't get in anything until you are sure with what you are going to deal with, especially in the crypto coins realm as it is the most tricky sphere ever existed in human history. Most of the non-technical articles are full of bullshit made by people who look "just at the price".
The most important thing is you don't want to deal just with Bitcoin itself but with the technology it brought. To work on some other coin as I do or to make software for coins in general.
Wish you luck! :)
