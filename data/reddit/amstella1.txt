Gold is consumed in contact with other things. My grandma wedding ring in 999 gold became 3 gr from originally 10gr after wearing it every day for 60 years. Bitcoin cannot :)

.. Again .. gold lose it value when used for jewelry. In fact if i use 10 gr of raw gold to make a jewel, the same jewel haven't same value of raw gold because work needed to do the jewel. Sure even if buy a lambo with BTC maybe I lose some value in BTC (but is not so true) when I sell same lambo. Anyway, to do another example, BTC have intrinsic value when it is lended. Same of "sheit" money or check but with no little difference that who receive BTC must not worry about civil war, governments failure or embargo and bank failure. Bitcoin refresh century society assumption about money. Bitcoin is free money!

Same here friend.
I need to advise newbe specially, this is my experience: 
all I can suggest is to pay attention when buy crypto trough fiat transfer. Probably i'm victim of a scam from CEX.IO, with a transfer trough the SEPA system (that is the most secure) as you can see trough the link. Unfortunately
they also accept cards that is most attractive for some people with low experiences, I don't know what can happen with a transfer trough a credit card if they normal behaviour consist in uncharge of fiat money on your account balance (or uncharge of crypto) after transfer and never reply to support request. Please
search and search again only exchange with positive feedback and that support you. Cex.io can do bad surprise to you.
Again after weeks (18day) they are not activated to support me in this issue after calling their bank, write negative experience on forums and opening support tickets with same argument. But nothing happens. Seems that at CEX.IO care only money. A serious exchange pay attention at their public image. But this exchange don't have a minimum modesty and customers are nothing that thing like a bancomat to leave in a limbo.
Other exchange like Kraken, even if they are slow, they follow their customers and constantly give information if something happens. Without leaving their customers in oblivion making the customers to think in a scam as like CEX.IO do.

True, like said from bce gov. Mr Draghi. Euro is right now euro and in the future because backed by eu central bank. "Who is backing to bitcoin?" he asked herself.
Yeah, I know, a small brain can answer to this question, for sure. But Draghi decided to not consider people, those do not exists, only central banks exists.
 I don't know if him need to study or he studied too much about cryptocurrencies, and then answered so:
