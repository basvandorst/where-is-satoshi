Until a couple of months ago, Japan (or more precisely the BTC/¥ pair) was responsable for around 2/3 of worldwide BTC trading. This according to cryptocompare.com

Please understand that cryptos are one part of the technosphere that Silicon Valley hasn't quite managed to dominate. Coinbase is only trying to rectify this unusual situation.

I would say not. When you open the ledger app it directs you to plug in your nano S. Until then the app's deaf and dumb..

I got tired of it maybe 6 months ago, posted, got downvoted, so you'll be in good company. Still think having an r/Bitcoin for over-18s and another for the kiddies would be a good idea.

Do you mean instead of reading your answer (as part of my own research), I should search the internet for a suitable answer, than come back and finish reading your answer?
It still makes you sound like a dick.

You 'could' need an outfit like Bitstamp to initially buy bitcoins after depositing some fiat currency with them. If not them, there are lots of others who can do the job. 
Once the bitcoins are in your Bitstamp (or whoever) acct, as a best practice, you should transfer them out of Bitstamp to a safe storage medium (such as a hardware wallet - Ledger, Trezor, etc).
Leaving your coins in the exchange acct is not considered particularly secure.

FWIW, in this week's Economist article about the 'kill-zone' around BigTech:
"Amazon’s cloud service, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has labelled many startups as “partners”, only to copy their functionality and offer them as a cheap or free service. A giant pushing into a startup’s territory, while controlling the platform that startup depends on for distribution, makes life tricky. For example, Elastic, a data-management firm, lost sales after AWS launched a competitor, Elasticsearch, in 2015."

Bitstamp is based in Slovenia. Opening an account with them, for a European (which I now am) is a rigorous KYC/AML process which really put me off when I opened my acct with them. However, support was extremely rapid when I had questions. I'm quite happy with them now that that is in the past.
Because US legislation has made it almost impossible for US citizens to open bank accounts in Europe (please look up FATCA if you're a non-believing USian), I can easily assume that some other US legislation about bitcoin has made it extremely undesirable for non-US exchanges to want to deal with American citizens.
This sounds like Karma-Is-A-Bitch to me.

I've never done a physical transaction with bitcoin, so I'm wondering, newbie question: how exactly did the transaction take place between you guys? Did buyer have the necessary coins in his wallet on a smartphone and sent them to your trezor which was hooked to a laptop? Or is there another way of doing this?

Actually Sean, you sound like the one on the high horse. When you say (argh) "Trump is our president" you mean "Trump is my (Sean's) president". You USAians are not the only one's here; not all that many people 'translate bitcoin to dollars' compared to those who 'translate' into yen, yuan, or euros; and your system of measure (acre feet, anyone?) is actually incredibly non-productive.

Absurd defeatism seems more lucid than statements like "Endless growth is a hyperbolic term for progress", which, while laudable, is also laughable.

So by extension, if it is decentralized, you can't sue it. Hmm, I think there will be a lot of frustrated Americans.

Bitstamp's KYC stuff when opening an account is pretty rigorous and almost had me chucking the whole thing. But, the support staff were helpful, almost apologetic, and it all ended well. Since then, no problem transferring fiat in (~1-2 days) or BTC out (&gt;1hr).

I don't know where you're from, but surely there are places in your home country where you would never go, especially after nightfall. Nothing to do with terrorism. Moreover, whenever you're travelling, nothing wrong with a little situational awareness.
