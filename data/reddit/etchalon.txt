Holy christ.
You do realize the full extent of the laws AML allows enforcement of, right?
Like, it's not JUST drugs. It's also, and this is a broad list:
1. Fraud
2. Human Trafficing
3. Child Pornography
4. International Sanctions (Iran, North Korea, Syria)
5. Theft
…it literally touches on, disables, and/or restricts, any type of crime that requires any type of sustained funding or provides for sustained profit.
So when you ask what the enemy is, I am baffled as to the myopathy required to even ask that.

I'm down-voting you for missing the point.
1. For many of the homeless population, there is literally nothing you can do but "give them something". They are homeless due to, in many cases, extreme mental illness or substance abuse issues. They suffer from a disease, of which no specific cure may exist.
2. It is impossible to easily differentiate between those who you can help and those you can't.
3. Given the above, the only "solution" is compassion.

Are sanctions effective? Sometimes.
Are they 100% effective 100% of the time? No.
Can sanctions create unintended, or indirect suffering on a people who have little choice as to the state whose regime controls their lives? Yes.
Are there better ways to handle certain diplomatic impasses beyond sanctions? Sometimes.
Are there always better avenues, or even other avenues, than sanctions? No.
But being "against sanctions" is like being "against laws".

I'm being sarcastic because, best I can tell, you have no clue what you're talking about.
Money laundering isn't illegal in the US. It only becomes illegal when the laundering is occurring in the context of a crime.
Shrem isn't in jail because he helped someone launder money. He's in jail because he helped someone who sold drugs launder money.
If you'd like to argue that drugs should be legal, you and I would be in complete agreement, be the bestest of friends and have iced tea beside many a pool.
But saying "money laundering shouldn't be illegal" is such a massive misunderstanding of the law itself, let alone comparing it to the use of phones, that I feel sarcasm is the only appropriate response.

I'm not going to enter in a pointless, rhetorical debate about the complete idiocy of many, many laws. Of course there are bad laws. Of course there are bad actors enforcing even good laws.
But my support for AML, and associated regulations, is not, nor have I presented it to be, some blind and willful trust of the state, and all its actions and consequences. Conflating it as such is absolutely a straw man.
I have argued only that AML is not such a law, and that Shrem willfully, purposefully, repeatedly broke it, and as such, deserves no more sympathy than what you'd extend any person who made a mistake in his life.

The conflict between isolationism and engagement is a very, very broad one, and while it's cool you know a dude who thinks Iranian sanctions are harmful, there's a line of scholars in his field who disagree. 
Smart people disagree on specific cases. And generally speaking, both sides have valid points. That one scholar would think that one instance was bad isn't much of defense of your broader statement.
Stating "sanctions don't work" is not a pie in the sky statement, but it is a decidedly broad, overly simplistic one. 
To me, the debate comes down to whether you feel that, unless they produce the desired outcome in some set amount of time, it's not worth trying. Or whether you believe that some specific outcome is desired as opposed to a perhaps, admittedly overly broad goal.
Sanctions have negative and positive effects, and they are one tool in the quiver of nations to unify or protest the actions of another. They are by no means, nor would any rational person argue, perfect or even always the right solution.
Let's get specific, and recent to clarify.
There are very good arguments, playing out as we speak, over whether the US and EU sanctions of Russia are working. It is hard to say, with any certainty, whether those sanctions discouraged Putin from taking further action, or whether that was his plan all along. It is always difficult to pull apart history and know, for certain, which cause had what effect. However, we do know, with reasonable certainty, that the sanctions revealed and inflamed a vulnerable Russian economy,  and a government far too dependent on oil revenues. The sanctions, with little debate, can be directly attributable to the economic crisis, and are, while not yet forcing a change in direction by the state, hastening the point at which the state will have to either alter course, or risk further weakening.
We may have a very good case for, or against, sanctions, within the next few years.
If we want to talk more broadly, we can discuss Iran, which is a bit of a clusterfuck for both sides of the debate. While sanctions have not desposed the regime, they have isolated them and slowed down, at an impressive scale, the speed at which they could acquire and actualize nuclear technology. Yes, sadly, other diplomatic and military measures have, so far failed to completely eliminate the danger they pose, but sanctions have at least given those mechanisms more time to try to act, though they did not guarantee a success.
And yes, of course, there are going to be hilarious cases of absolutely ridiculously weirdly specific applications of otherwise broad intents. Blizzard had to delete accounts because they are an American business, and the law says American businesses can't do business with people in Iran.

Regarding Shrem, I have no sympathy for him. His crime wasn't accidental. He knew exactly what he was doing, what laws he was breaking, and chose to do so anyway, not out of some protest or matter of philosophical disagreement, but a combination of greed, arrogance and youthful stupidity.
Two years is a relatively short prison term, and he earned the time.

As for the "plenty of ways to investigate", yes. There are. But no, sans AML and it's many, many record keeping requirements, it would not be easy or even practical to review, or enforce, from a financial angle.
Second, even if we accept that there _were_ such a mechanism, or that it were practical, you ignore the point of the laws, which is to prevent and restrict those activities at a deeper level than "hope we catch them after the fact! And man, let's pray we can get all the money back before they run off."
@_date: 2014-12-30 10:22:28
So, you're basically gonna pretend money laundering isn't at all a standard operating procedure for human trafficking, terrorism or not-even-a-little-victimless fraud?
@_date: 2014-12-30 19:09:50
It would be nice if we could quantify it. But we can't. It is impossible.
It is in no way contradictory to be for AML laws and against the drug war, just as I am for keeping murder illegal, but against the drug war (which is responsible for a shocking number of murders.)
The drug war taints this country's entire law enforcement apparatus, but that does not mean the tainted things are without value on their own.
There's no "fantasy" of Jack Bauer using AML to catch a terrorist involved here, at least not in my disagreement with you. Simplifying my position to imply that's the case is weird. 
Elimination of AML laws would make tracking money hilariously impractical. Before the BSA it was hilariously impractical. It's still insanely difficult, but not impractical. Elimination would also enable a new, hilariously massive quick flow of cash to people you really don't want to have that cash.
Again, I think your entire "AML laws are bad!" stance comes from being currently annoyed them due to your involvement with Bitcoin, and not in any way with the realities of the laws or the good they do.

That is completely ridiculous.
You are not asking the government's permission to "do good." You are asking the government to grant your organization special status because it does good. 
As part of that special status, there is a certification process and a continued requirement to provide accurate, binding reports.
The benefit of that is that I, as a person trying to help you "do good" don't have to pay taxes on the money I give you to "do good."
Being unable to do so, I will likely give your organization less money. 
So, in the name of your ideology, you are harming the people you aim to help.

I brought up Reason Mag as a signal to you that I'm fully aware of, have read up on, considered, and even agreed with huge parts of the basic tenants of libertarianism and debating that is beyond boring to me.
I do not offer "ideas in return" because I do not believe that life is simple enough to be defined by a single ideology. I find ideologies to be largely the refuse of people who dislike or cannot manage the necessary contradictions, hypocrisies, edge cases, and side effects of a thoroughly modern, connected world.
But, more to the point, even if I did have such a thesis on life, or government, I find demanding I express it, or implying that I haven't considered it, to be an easy out of you. It is very easy to dismiss someone as uniformed, and much, much harder to debate someone who is informed, but disagrees.

I think, as is often the case with "laws we don't like right now", you're ignoring the good almost entirely and focusing only on the unintended consequences.
Perhaps the only way to combat certain objectively evil organizations and practices is to stem, as best as possible, their source of funding. While we will never, can never, craft a system that would perfectly ensure these organizations do not receive funds, it is important enough to force these organizations to use intensely complex means to mask and protect their funding, and to provide law enforcement with secondary means of investigation and prosecution. These laws are incredibly effective at doing just that.
It is a minimally invasive set of regulations which has few consequences for the average citizen. 
I believe that, were drugs legalized, the "unintended" consequences of these regulations would be far less heinous than you're implying. Many of these consequences don't come from the regulations themselves, but from enforcement of our idiotic, overzealous drug war.
@_date: 2014-07-14 18:56:51

People on eBay don't accept Paypal. They accept USD, which they are willing to receive via Paypal/VISA, etc.
USD is the currency, Paypal/VISA are just transport mechanisms. 
BTC, for those merchants, is analogous to those. They don't "accept BTC", they "accept BTC as a means to pay with USD."
It gets confusing because we short hand "Will you accept my USD if it comes from VISA?" with "Do you accept VISA?"
So no, none of those merchants see BTC as a valid currency. Just an acceptable means to get a currency they do accept.

Largely because it marks an indefensible abuse of state's rights over a populace and decimates numerous core arguments in favor of it. 
Also, most state's rights advocates are idiots and never counter back with the relatively simple reminder that many states passed laws banning slavery long before the nation as a whole did. And that many legalized abortion, long before roe v wade. And marriage equality. And environmental protections. And consumer protections. And numerous other advances which happened on the state level first before spreading nationally. 
This argument only ends the debate because people don't like to admit that state's rights do not insure liberty anymore so than does federal rule. Neither side has a perfect track record.

Any additional system you have as a business has a maintenance cost associated with it. It may be negligible, but it exists.
It the case of a Bitcoin POS, you'd have the following costs, at a minimum to consider:
1. Hardware investment (usually a dedicated smart phone).
2. Staff training.
3. Record-keeping, compliance, general accounting costs.
If Bitcoin is enabled for an ecommerce business, while you can ignore the dedicated hardware (unless you also have a retail store), you'll usually have a cost associated with integrated the new payment flow into your system. If you use an off-the-shelf system, you may get away with relatively minor front-end development costs. Custom systems, like the ones I usually build, have a larger cost associated with them. The last BTC integration I coded up cost the costumer about 2k, in development and additional QA. 
Luckily, I'd written the base cart and checkout process to handle off-site payment from day one, so it was mostly just wiring up Coinbase, testing it, and some simple HTML development on the forms to support the new method.
The cart before that ran them about 8k. The cart had to be completely re-wired to handle a payment flow that would not complete on the site itself. 
Neither customer has seen a single BTC sale. One has already turned off support.
