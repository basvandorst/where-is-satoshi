I didn't have a good site to gauge BTC/day, found one in these comments, so yes this was better than a search engine.

Thank gawd I got out when then missed their second or third promised announcement. All the signs were there.

They rejected my verification because my ID address differs from my billing address. Then the owner gave me shit about it.

Correct me if I'm wrong but when a cluster of miners give up and sell their gear the difficulty adjusts allowing for others to ramp up. The shrinking size of the architecture on these mining boards will alway keep mining feasable for those who got a head start.

Thanks for the response, I found a nice site that breaks down the costs/profit ratio:   I'd break even in 81 days but then need new hardware to keep up. Not worth it.
