Everyone is Tom and you know it.
Most of the people that hodl'ed 100% in the first few years says they did it accidentally or forgot they had bitcoins.
If you want to learn from that then remember to forget you bought bitcoins

Don't trust Roger Ver and his website Bitcoin.com:
Roger Ver did this to his site [
After being threatened with a lawsuit he changed it to this:
Someone needs to explain to Roger Ver that BTC stands for bitcoin, the C doesn't stand for "Core". That is impossible because "Core" the fullnode software "core" did not exist until **2014** with the release of 0.9.0 which is the first time the node software was called Core. **Obviously exchanges still used the ticker "BTC" long before 2014.**
If Roger Ver thinks the "C" stands for "Core" then he has to update his website to call his coin: Bitcoin Core Cash or Bitcoin Core Cash ABC
**UPDATE: Just got banned from Roger's subreddit for posting this over there**

This is why the richest traders keep pumping and dumping. It causes you and other weak hands to let money fall out of your hands and into theirs. The more weak hands the more the big money is incentivized to keep doing it.
In a pump &amp; dump, The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
If the poor stopped reacting to it, there could be less of it

There's probably more people reading about Lebanon's currency restrictions then there are actual Lebanese people reading about how bitcoin can help them.
There should be a format to bring rapid Bitcoin education to the actual country affected, whenever this happens. It's low hanging fruit.
Put bitcoin stickers and informational links on the ATM's **in Lebanon,** have a "Bitcoin Sign Guy" in Lebanon that is captured by media coverage, make P2P or OTC trades possible

It's advice to not engage in trading. Do not react to the pump &amp; dumps. He reacted to it and sold shortly after buying. The more he and others do that, the more aggressive the pump &amp; dumps become.

there was a scam going around where people would stick their own QR code on a sign that said "Send bitcoin here".. they would just tape it to the outside of the ATM. People actually would send their bitcoin there instead.  
This is at 2-way ATM's where people would collect cash/sell BTC at ATM

"I run the program and I see my bitcoins, I'm not gonna screw with it"
I think this is why people don't upgrade 
If people tested their backup solutions before using bitcoin core, they might feel more comfortable upgrading it. I just don't believe people even do that which puts them in a bad position when their client becomes outdated. They'd rather not mess with it.
