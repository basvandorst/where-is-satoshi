Use coinbase.com. I know a ton of people who use it, including myself. You need to link your bank account first, which takes a few days. If you want to store your coins yourself, use Electrum.

Hi, and welcome to the sub. I'll tell you what I tell everyone else who asks this question: It is almost always a good time to buy. I asked the same question when the price shot up to $400 a while back, and almost held off from buying. I went with my gut, bought, and the price shot up to ~$1250 an few weeks later. Even if the price keeps dropping, right now is still a good time to buy. Never hesitate. In my opinion, the only thing you would want to time correctly in the BTC market is selling.
Remember, you only lose money if you sell at a loss. Even if you buy now and the price goes WAY down, you really wouldn't have lost any money, unless you sold. Good luck and have fun. Try not to take this stuff too seriously, and most importantly: DO NOT PUT MONEY INTO THE MARKET THAT YOU CAN NOT AFFORD TO LOSE. This isn't really a "gamble" but you need to be aware that the price may shoot WAY down, putting you in a terrible position if you absolutely needed that money.

You should go on a completely different PC, change your passwords for literally everything, download Electrum, transfer your BTC to there, keep that PC offline, and nuke your old PC. Or you can keep your coins in a paper wallet. Regardless, get everything important off of that PC and switch all your passwords.

Nice shitpost.

Yes. The market is so unpredictable it's pretty much always good to buy.

Thank you so much for insight. I'm just annoyed that it takes forever to get everything verified so you can actually buy and receive BTC.

Relax.

Same boat as you! Bought really low. I also use coinbase.

Don't be a douchebag. If you try to cancel you'll just be marked as high risk and they'll stop doing business with you.

Thank you.

I asked the same exact question at $400. I bought. It's almost always a good idea to buy. Just don't spend what you can't afford to lose.
