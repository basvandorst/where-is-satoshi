Keep us updated lol I wanna to see the outcome
@_date: 2019-03-04 15:43:53
Why even post this? Of course the dragon is  fucking it!
@_date: 2019-03-04 17:26:02
Oohhhhh I’m way into it now, wouldn’t we then just be calling Satoshis TROGDORs instead
@_date: 2019-03-28 03:31:18
Hands down the best form of “physical coin” I’ve seen on this sub 
Bravo �� 
@_date: 2019-03-27 01:27:07
Stop poking it, you might disturb something

Sat Stacks��
@_date: 2019-11-28 03:47:04
But why in gods name would he go with keeping it all on the shit app?
@_date: 2019-11-26 17:59:43
Thanks to BTC I put off a lot of urges now. I throw them all in to sats and even if I don’t immediately profit, it’s nice to accumulate. Something I should’ve been doing freshman year of high school back in 2011 lol
@_date: 2019-03-28 15:55:59
If this is the case why do we already do that and we’re still in debt...
@_date: 2019-12-19 03:18:50
Same situation with a nano myself, bouta cop a job for next semester too to stack more sats to help the chain.

Go look up and do some research on what money is before you go off spouting how “they aren’t currency”
Money is not limited to who says what is and isn’t deemed so like fiat regulators. Money has the potential to be is money by the consensus that which supports the currency. 
Just like the USD, people put their faith and values in it because it is deemed a medium of exchange by governments across the globe that use it, same case for gold. If people choose to believe it has value (even though you may not) and they exchange it like your fiats, then that is definitely money.

 If a group decides to say fuck the USD and exchange coke bottle caps a la Fallout style whos to stop a group of people from deeming it currency. Your opinion?
@_date: 2019-12-22 23:04:08
Not in NY but fr if you get cash apps card and store your bits on some hardware device, you can use it pretty easily
At least that’s what I do here in va
@_date: 2019-12-19 14:49:55
That thought has crossed crossed my mind before. I still can’t imagine it’s easy though. Yeah they have the login (password/pin) for your ledger but they would still need the device on hand.

Or working towards a coin instead lol

I noticed crypto daily went missing for a week
@_date: 2019-12-13 18:23:00
That old fuck only knows what he wants to know about the world though. Because shit has been set in front of him on a silver platter for so long he’s lost touch with how society views things like this “asset”. But you’re right I bet he has someone holding for him too.
@_date: 2019-04-10 15:00:52
This is literally every video I see that talk about crypto. And everyone has a goddamn thumbnail like this; a tactic used by fortnite and call of duty channels. I’m done with certain technical analysts, and if you watch the channels that post new daily like this you’d be better off just doing the research yourself
@_date: 2019-04-08 13:25:32
I think it’s be cause you say that you don’t have enough funds for an offline wallet
@_date: 2019-04-23 02:01:02
Its deep, but It’s not that deep man
@_date: 2019-12-07 15:57:21
This guys gonna get rekkt

You should base the exchange buy from off credibility, not prices.
Personally I’ve never heard of them, maybe someone has had experience with them

If you can’t find a local atm then the local wizard is the only way to do it in this day and age
@_date: 2019-04-08 13:44:14
That’s a good reasoning imo; if you’re planning on trading frequently and want it in the quickest fashion then you’re probably better off
@_date: 2019-12-13 20:27:38
Ight bet
@_date: 2019-04-08 14:40:30
We are Desparity and return to mean, change my mind 
@_date: 2019-09-19 02:44:27
I always think If that happens then it’d probably be other matters to worry about
@_date: 2019-09-18 16:33:32
Lol I forgot all about “the prophecy”
@_date: 2019-05-04 15:24:35
Algorithm stupi, I/community smart
@_date: 2019-05-09 06:04:55
Never left
@_date: 2019-05-01 02:05:30
His point being. You’re gonna learn a lesson you don’t want lol
