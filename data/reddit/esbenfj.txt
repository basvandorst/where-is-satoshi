Hi, I am Esben from CrowdCurity.
First of all. Everybody can sign up at CrowdCurity. if you received the mail you should already have an account, if you fill out your profile it will go through a short review and then you can submit reports. It takes no time.
The reason for the automatic mail response, which we will reformulate for the future. is that we already have a large amount of skilled security researchers testing on programs including the Blockchain.info program daily.
I am sorry for any confusion caused.
- Esben

Great idea to have this group. Bitcoin and security will be big topics in 2014

Hi, Esben from CrowdCurity here.
We are working on ways to do this better. We have a feature on our list to create an option for businesses to select whether they want the program to be open for all or not. We will push this feature forward and if all goes in order to the plan have it implemented by next week.
We have also reformulated the mail you received, so it fits with the current situation. Which is that everybody can sign up and will go through a short review before they can submit.

Hi, Esben from Crowdcurity here.
Thanks for the feedback. Below are my answers to the topics you raise.
- We are always trying to improve the payment process. There are many steps in this process from getting the funds from the clients, to moving them further to you, which is why sometimes it takes some time.
- Regarding professionalism, we only request avatars and profiles to be of a certain standard for our vetted researchers, which have access to special vetted programs. But everybody can sign up and participate in the "Open for all" programs, and there are no requirements on avatar or anything for these. Circle, Changetip, localbitcoins and blockchain.info are all doing "open for all" programs at Crowdcurity, which means all that is required is a Crowdcurity user.
- We in general not take sides between the researcher and the business, but try to solve any conflicts that might arise. But the general nature of bug bounty programs is that if a business does not feel they get value, they do not pay.  If a business continuosly does not honor their bounties, we do however close the program.

Hi, It is not a "no". We just need your username on CrowdCurity to be able to bypass verification and vetting for you.

Hi, Esben from Crowdcurity here.
We do not require passport to participate in the programs. We have special private programs, where we require identification check, but for the "Open for all" programs, all you need is an user at Crowdcurity. 
Blockchain.info, Circle, Changetip and Localbitcoins are all doing "Open for all" programs.
