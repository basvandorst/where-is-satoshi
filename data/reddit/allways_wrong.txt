Blockchain tech is not extremely useful. 
It has a very limited but valuable use case, despite what people will peddle. 
It is *only* required when used in a decentralised system to create a secure, trustless system. In any other system it is not required and is a burden, except for marketing; bullshitchains. 
So far the killer app, and the obvious first app, is currency. And practically nobody is using it (yet).

We have the same in Australia; completely cashless and now free and instant peer-to-peer transfers if using the same bank (upgrading to any bank this year). 
So why bitcoin?
Frankly I just like the idea. It’s a community thing. It’s “bottom up” instead of “top down”. That nobody controls it makes it almost a digital, naturally occurring element. It is far more a digital cash than what banks offer, even though the user experience is the same. 
It is also the first global currency. It might make converting and exchanging a thing of the past. 
As it is not backed nor controlled by anything it is not affected by events such as change of governments, natural disasters, sanctions, bad government policy, trade wars, and so on. As odd as it seems to say this in 2018 bitcoin might become the most stable of currencies. 
There is a whole ethos and globally unifying nature to bitcoin that fiat doesn’t have. The value and importance of bitcoin is not just technical, not at all.

For me it is that **btc is taking a layered approach.**
Layer 1 is Bitcoin, Layer 2 looks like it will be Lightning, and the higher layers are up to anyone’s imagination. 
This is how good software is created. Always. Everywhere. 
Your Operating System is itself a stack of layers that have been developed over time. So is the internet. 
Each layer brings new functionality, at first limited and/or unstable, and then slowly solidifies into a solid base on which to build new layers on top of. 
Bitcoin (Layer 1) is currently being made *more efficient* through SegWit adoption and some other things like Schnorr signatures in the works.  I’ve always admired efficiency over brute force. 
Bch in comparison looks to be trying to solve every problem on one, single layer. A kitchen utensil that does everything. Big blocks are a slippery slope and solving its requirements is a lot more than just buying cheap hard drives. For example how fast can you broadcast a 1GB block to all the other nodes? You’ve got ten minutes until the next, and just receiving it cuts into your mining time. How many nodes or miners can afford this type of bandwidth, and what does that mean for security?
But overall it’s because btc is taking a layered approach which in simply best practise. 
Hope that widens your horizons a little. Keep going. 
Ninja edit: now I think about it it could be argued that Lightning is not Bitcoin at all, just like HTTP is not Ethernet. Although I’m sure the stack will be called The Bitcoin Stack, or just Bitcoin for short. 
Pro-tip: Bitcoin (big B) is the protocol and bitcoin 
(little b) is its baked-in currency.

I’ve a forum post in late 2011 where I did “some research” and wrote it off as a failed experiment. It had just dropped about 90%. 
I work in IT so it’s even more unbelievable to me that until very recently I hadn’t come across anyone that was into it. Seriously, what are the chances?

This is definitely the storm on the horizon. Explode indeed. If it works as planned there’ll me a massive uptake in hype and news and ultimately value which will feedback on itself all over again. 
Possibly a complete and total game changer. 
I’d really like to see Bitcoin Layer 1 be able to handle more transactions before that happens though, via SegWit adoption, Schnorr signatures and even a 2MB block. It’ll need it just to be able to handle the trading action, let alone the on ramps to LN. 
Ignoring price it’s all super fascinating to watch and be a part of.

Bitcoin never aimed to solve all the problems on the first layer. Bitcoin is a protocol. There is a stack building on top of it, more than likely Lightning being Layer 2. 
It’s not unlike Ethernet and IP. 
Most alt coins are trying to solve all the problems in one layer and calling it the be all and end all. This approach creates enormous complication and room for unforeseen errors. 
Payment systems like crypto *cannot at all* have a bug, apologise to those affected, and roll a patch out. It’s money. It has to be rock fucking 100% solid, especially so in a monetary system where you can’t be refunded. 
Bitcoin (layer 1) is *intentionally* dumb. This has always been the plan. It’s been running with no errors *at all* for how many years now? Can you point to any other piece of widely used software with that record? How much value has been exchanged during that time?

Couldn’t an operator set up similar on LN? An account for coffees and tacos. An account for private stuff. And so on as deep as you need. perhaps even shared nodes. 
While I agree with Snowden’s comment to the effect of “Just because you are innocent doesn’t mean you should give up your right to privacy” I think it is pretty easy to get lost/hidden in the noise, and to take some basic yet effective precautions.

Perhaps it’s slightly more than that. 
Firstly bitcoin has to be *able to be* used as a daily currency, even if it’s not because of its rising value. 
Bad money pushes out the good. We’ve seen this all throughout history where the good currency is hoarded and the bad spent, for the exact reason you outlined. 
But I think if people can use it in daily life, if Lightning works and gets wide adoption, people will still spend btc occasionally if to just promote it. It would be a statement of sorts, a conscious choice, even a movement. Perhaps even a currency war. 
And unless people can actually use it as a currency very easily, if they choose to, then it’s not a currency. 
But yeah, most of it will be hoarded until it becomes stable.

Sorry, long reply :)
Bitcoin is *intentionally* a dumb, simple protocol. This has always been the intention. Simple is dumb, but simple is easy. Easy to secure and what is more important for money than security?
Bitcoin has been plodding along *faultlessly* for many years now, a rock-solid protocol for exchanging value. Battle tested. 
All the others have had to implement extra, more complicated, less secure protocols in an effort to catch up. Most if not all of these are as yet unproven. The training wheels are still to come off. They are still centralised so that they can work (I’m looking at you iota and ripple). 
As you may or may not be aware second layer applications are now being built on top of Bitcoin (big B = protocol). The Lightning Network being the most famous. There are a few implementations of Lightning, all of which are now running in beta on the *main* network. 
Lightning allows instant, cheap, secure transactions. Just like flashy alt coins but actually running on top of the bullet proof, battle tested, widely known and single unit of account in the crypto network Bitcoin protocol using bitcoin, not somecoin. 
Then there are side chains like RootStock which is now also actually, really running on *main* net, albeit also in beta. RootStock is a smart contracts platform that is backward compatible with Ethereum, and extends it further; even smarter contracts. Again, this is using the battle tested, blah blah Bitcoin chain. Not somecoin. 
And then there are atomic swaps that will render exchanges useless. These are for chains using the same Proof Of Work algorithm; SHA256. Bitcoin being the most well known. 
Bitcoin is not just the turtle in this race, it is the turtle that has a head start. 
I saw an excellent analogy for Bitcoin Layer 1 the other day; Ethernet. This layer also blasts data out to every node in a really inefficient fashion. It absolutely cannot stream video. Other layers had to be built on top. Ethernet is still there, supporting all the layers built on top. 
We are now launching Bitcoin Layer 2. Most other coins are not, nor even have plans to. They will be left behind trying to replicate Bitcoin’s multi layer approach, each built on the rock solid shoulders of the layer below, all in a single protocol. Good luck. 
These promises by alt coins of fast, free and instant transactions, limitless scaling and so on are, literally, nothing more than promises and dreams, or the effect of an empty blockchain. 
Bitcoin is so real it is old, yet only just starting to begin stage 2.

Lightning is now in beta on MainNet and so is RootStock. And everything is looking very good. 
Bitcoin is the only battle-tested turtle in this race, with a massive head start. 
Alt coin fanboys saying bitcoin is dead might end up eating their words, just like everyone else that said that has. 
It’ll happen in 2018, and very suddenly.

Just some alternate perspectives:


I would top up my account/hot wallet/Lightning wallet instead of settling. Yes, you can do this. 


Sounds like withdrawing cash at an ATM and putting into my wallet. 
Also, Lightning transactions are not broadcast to every single node and then stored on them for all of eternity. They are routed from me to the recipient. Not recorded. (Yes they *could be* recorded but on Layer 1 they absolutely are recorded, forever)
They are all still secured by the most secure thing created by man. 
This is all much more like digital cash than Layer 1 is.

Saying “just”. It’s not easy peasy. At all. 
Some of these forks for example are  made by dev teams that have “just” been able to do the fork. Even B2x *crashed* right before it was supposed to activate. (I’m not so much criticising the devs as much as illustrating the complexity and high stakes). 
The Lightning Network is not simple either. In many ways more complex. 
I saw a representative of Bitcoin Gold on the lnd channel a few days ago. Offering a bounty to get on LN. 
They were told alts are not a priority, no surprise for anyone, and that it is open source so why not do it themselves? It read like they can’t. 
That’s all; it’s not as easy as most people think, and a lot if not the vast majority of alts are clones that are just limping along, or worse. 
Obviously Litecoin and a few others will be on soon. I’m not sure if you mean alt-coins or al7-K01nz, if you know what I mean.

Value is very hard to determine. Even define. 
However market value is easy; it’s what it is exchanging for. 
Right now Bitcoin has some utility value as a system to exchange value across the internet. That utility is expected to increase as it evolves via the addition of second, third and more layers on top of it. Lightning is probably going to be the second layer in the protocol stack. 
Bitcoins utility value will also increase as it has more users; Metcalfs Law; users^2. 
Right now most of its value is speculative; speculation on its future utility value. It’s early days no matter what most people seem to think, so it can only be speculative.

The log scale will go in a perfectly straight line if the compounding rate stays constant. The S curve implies that rate increases during early to late adoption, then tapers off. 
The curve is not a constant so is not straight, even on a logarithmic scale. It is even more pronounced on a linear scale. 
I think it’s impossible to value as an individual. Its utility comes from how many other people use it. It’s a network, a messaging app. It’s worthless no matter how good the tech if you’re the only one using it. 
So, impossible to value. It can only value itself via the collective.

It’s expected Bitcoin will be able to handle *far* more transactions than that!
Good software works in layers. Your operating system, the Internet, software stacks. Even real world systems have layers that have built on top of each other over time such as government, languages, the scientific method. 
The Lightning Network, which I’m sure you’ve heard of by now, is Layer 2 in the Bitcoin stack of protocols. Relative to your proclamation that you’ll eat your own dick if it gets there Lightning is *scaleless*. It is a mesh so can grow infinitely *outward*, rather than upward which requires more and more resources. A mesh network actually becomes *more* efficient as it grows. 
It’s just sprouting now. 
As a real world example of this method of layering software underlying the protocol stack that you are using to read this very sentence lies Ethernet. It is as inefficient as Bitcoin Layer 1. And yet we can stream 4K video on top of it.

Bitcoin is radically different to most, arguably all, of the alt coins. It is *totally* decentralised. We don’t even know its inventor. 
A top down, centrally controlled project certainly looks more organised, professional, marketable and ultimately more successful and profitable, but that is exactly what the Soviets thought too.

@_date: 2017-12-03 23:26:51
A seed (phrase) generates a wallet (bank). A wallet has many addresses (accounts). 
Each address is a pair of keys; a public key (a.k.a. address) that you share, people send money to it, and a private key, don’t share as this allows the holder to spend from the address. 
An address contains transactions. Spent transactions are, well, spent and have no value. Unspent transactions are like notes in your wallet, money. 
So, whoever has the private key to an address can spend from it (spend the unspent transactions). Don’t share it. 
Going further, whoever has the seed phrase to a wallet can generate ALL the addresses in the wallet. All the public-private key pairs. This is your backup. Don’t share it (except with your mum). 
Happy to explain some more.

The real, underlying question that could answer all of the above is *what is Bitcoin*? A currency? An commodity? Something entirely new? A failed experiment?  
I don’t think *any* of the crypto currencies are going to work as a real currency until they achieve rock solid stability, against either other currencies or against the price of bread, if you follow. None of them are remotely close. 
In my limited opinion bitcoin is the closest, it’s the most stable, and is the most likely to eventually reach a saturation point that will give it stability. The more holders/nodes the more stable it becomes. 
At that point it might actually be usable as a stable currency. We can assume a decade at least, so second layer apps will be fleshed out by then, perhaps being used for nano payments in the meantime?
I.e. there really are some fundamentals with *huge* upside, even at its current price and its current problems. 
Guaranteed? Hell no. It’s a speculative asset.

RDBMS is not Oracle. Can’t agree at all with you there. But I get your gist and I’m making a nerdy, vapid point. 
Bitcoin (big B) is trying to be *the* platform for the internet of money. It is something entirely new, a new paradigm, so comparing it to anything will always come up slightly short. In my opinion TCP is the closest analogy we will get, from the technological angle. There are sociological angles too, financial angles of course, and on and on. 
Bitcoin is like TCP because it is fundamentally a messaging system. 
But it is a messaging system whose history of messages cannot be changed. 
That is pretty much “all” Bitcoin (big B) is. 
The most obvious and appropriate thing to do with a messaging system like that is use it as a ledger, for bitcoin (little b). Which is where we are. 
Now, on top of that platform one can build anything. That is why it is called “the internet of money”. Side chains and second layer apps are just starting to sprout on top of the Bitcoin protocol/layer/platform just like the early internet did on top of TCP.

It’s possible they’ve been looking for a form of “internet money” ever since. They are, along with Starbucks, listed as “partners” with ICE in moving bitcoin into the mainstream. [source]( 
We will have to wait and see how much of that is true, and/or how it pans out. 
Along with that ICE wants to enable proper ...man, what’s the word? It’s not “Barossa Shiraz”. But that’s all I can see.  Where a *trusted* company looks after your money for you. All proper like. 
Now, before you ball at “trusted”, “company”, and “looking after for you” you have to realise that in this instance we are talking about ICE looking after retirement funds and the like. Serious money. The type of money you don’t bury under a birdbath. 
And it is [real](  and given that ICE own and *very* successfully run the New York Stock Exchange it probably shouldn’t be brushed off as some guy drinking too much Shiraz and launching an ICO via a web template with lots of confusing tech terms. It is the real deal. 
*IF* it goes as they plan, and ICE tend to be rather successful with their plans (understatement) then bitcoin might just maybe become what all the hype and underlying reality of the whole fucking infrastructure and premise and decentralised and oh-so-tantalisingly-close-to-proven pattern says it might be. 
There’s a very good long form article on Fortune about all this, but my google force is too weak at the moment to find it. 
By the way, BAKKT want to use their own Layer 2 solution which is not like the Lightning Network. At all. 
Ninja edit: Barossa Valley Shiraz is the best Shiraz. Needs its own name. 
**EDIT:** Shiraz *is* the Australian version of ~~Sirah~~ Syrah. TIL. 
Edit^2: shoulda been called Shazza. 
Wdit^3: Now we need an Australian version of a French wine that starts with a ‘D’, so we can have “Shazza and Dazza”.  (Sharon and Darren)

About ten years ago I paid for an eBay item using **PayPal**. Next morning I got a message that my payment wasn't cleared because my credit card didn't have enough funds. I clicked the link to pay using another method and chose direct debit instead (or something to this effect).
All good. Payment received. Item being delivered.
A week later I got another email "Your credit card payment has been successful!" Uh-Oh.
PayPal kept attempting to use the original payment method until it was successful. I had now paid twice. I read the fine print; it's there.
I got into contact with the vendor who said they hadn't been paid twice. Now, I can't 100% trust the vendor but after many, many emails and discussions I had no reason to believe they were actually ripping me off.
I complained to PayPal and asked for my second payment back. Into the system I go.
Another week later I got an email from the vendor saying that their one, original payment had been reversed, and that they now also owed the same again because they had allegedly stolen the second payment. Their account was now *negative* the correct balance!
After talking with the vendor on many occasions I have reason to believe that we *both* got ripped off by PayPal. I can't be sure of course, but the vendor was more worried than I because reputation and such.
When you contact PayPal about these type of issues there is *an impenetrable wall* of call centre help people, and then another wall after that, and another... it may take weeks for them to get back to you and often you have to start all over again, trying to explain the obvious to them. There are a lot of shifty characters working who-knows-where doing who-knows-what with the accounts they are responsible for.
In the end it is not worth your time and effort to try and get your money back. I received their insurance to about 10% of my loss and called it a day.
**Fuck PayPal.**

G'day. Australia here.
Find me *one* picture of a nice playground, anywhere in Russia. How hard can that be?
I'll see if I can find *one* picture of a rundown playground in Australia.
It'll be tough for both of us.
While this is a pretty silly "test" it is a good litmus test. It's a visual measure of how much care and respect is given to mothers and children.
As for big-picture stuff our GDP is the same as your GDP, but we're 26m people.
Buuuuuttt... that said I know exactly what you're talking about. Russia is nowhere near as bad as people in the west like to think. The metros are excellent with trains coming every 10 seconds (I counted),  supermarkets are fully stocked, far more than ours actually, quality varies between worse and better than ours (oh, the deserts!), and they are always open! The cities are beautiful, until you go a few streets off, say Nevsky, where there are still bullet holes in the walls from ze Germans. And the people are either going to rob you or give you the shirts off their back, so to say; black or white. There is a growing middle class that is not dissimilar to middle classes everywhere. The upper class is so upper I feel uncomfortable being around them; it's wealth nobody has in Australia.
Little known/often forgotten fact: The idea of a mortgage in Russia is very new. I would imagine housing ownership levels, no mortgage, must be around 95%.
Fun fact: Everything is cash. EVERYTHING. You buy a house? Cash. A multimillion dollar business. Cash. I mean paper cash too, not a cheque. Yes really; suitcases of cash. If you pull out a credit card anywhere you look like a loser. **I think bitcoin will be VERY popular in Russia.**
If I'm honest it is actually very hard to describe Russia because, well, it's Russia. But that means it is *not* what westerners think it is like, not at all.

 to get very low transaction fees
1. View [the latest mined block](
2. Scroll nearly all the way to the bottom.
3. Click through some transactions and note the cheap, cheap fees.
[Here's one example for 11c tx fees, mined in 6 minutes](
[Here's another example for 10c tx fees, mined in 2 minutes](
Wallet algorithms keep entering high fees, *because* wallet algorithms keep entering high fees. Ad nauseum.
This is the dumb problem. **The wallets are stuck** in a type of infinite, dumb loop. 
Bitcoin is not broken. I've been sending *heaps* of 10c transactions the past week. Fuck, there are more of these cheap transactions every day than the entire sum of transactions on "the other chain".

Most of the money created by banks, and it is just "created" I agree at 10:1, is lent out for housing. The vast majority of it. Yes?
To get a loan for a house you have to use the house as collateral. Yes?
The house then goes on the bank's books. Yes?
EDIT: OK it appears you are talking cash and I am talking capital. Agree that as far as cash goes it is certainly created at or about 10:1.
However the implied negative of this is some sort of hyper inflation, which isn't happening because that created cash gets sunk into the created capital object, mostly new houses.

I just want to repeat that *fundamental piece of information*.
**If you don't hold the private keys to your coin, it's not your coin.** 
At the very least create a wallet offline, stick it on a usb, and transfer your coins from the exchange to an address on that wallet. It's not perfect but it's a sight better than keeping your coins on an exchange!

**Because we are talking about Venezuela**, and it's a crisis, I hope it's OK to hijack this thread with some very useful information, that I've posted previously...
Sorry I don't speak Spanish.
 to get very low transaction fees on the bitcoin/btc chain
1. View [the latest mined block](
2. Scroll nearly all the way to the bottom.
3. Click through some transactions and note the cheap, cheap fees.
4. Set your transactions fee to the same, or thereabouts.
You will need a wallet where you can set your own fees. Electrum, Armory, Trezor etc.
[Here's one example for 11c tx fees, mined in 6 minutes](
[Here's another example for 10c tx fees, mined in 2 minutes](
Obviously neither are mine.
Wallet algorithms keep entering high fees, *because* wallet algorithms keep entering high fees. Ad nauseum. They auto enter high fees to make sure your transaction is at or near the top. They keep auto creating higher and higher fees. This is the dumb problem. **The wallets are stuck** in a type of infinite, dumb loop. &lt;&lt; read this again.
Bitcoin is not broken. I've been sending *heaps* of 10c transactions the past week.
Now you know : )
Please test with some small amounts and confirm.
I guess I should add this works better when the damn hashrate is oscillating to the btc chain.

As per the title of the graph.
I have to admit myself it is really weird that the number of transactions went down, next to zero, since the price shot up. Perhaps the graph is wrong.
We can compare [here](
...but now I can't help but notice the average size of those bcc transactions. You can calculate in your head the average amount of bcc in a transaction; it's not small. That's weird too?

@_date: 2017-08-16 22:22:15
Well, that is definitely a problem at the moment. It is rapidly deflating *even though it is in an inflationary stage*; coins are still being mined. 
So for now at least it is *definitely* being used as a speculative store of value, not a currency as such.
However, at some point it will reach a saturation point and become stable. Then it can be traded for goods and services without the fear of it rocketing up in value a moment later.
You can see the curve flattening out [when you use the logarithmic chart]( which is more appropriate for a rapidly compounding anything.

Fees: 0.00002486 btc
Note that is an OLD block from when I posted. Use the latest few blocks. 
[this is a good fee estimation site]( Your transaction will probably be about 250 bytes (global average) so multiply satoshis per byte by 250 to get you transaction price. 
Example: if you opt to get your transaction confirmed in 2 blocks, and that is currently 100 satoshis, then your transaction will cost about 100 x 250 = 25000 satoshis = 0.00025 btc. 
Clear as mud? 
1 btc is divided into 8 decimal places. 100 satoshis = 1 bit. 1,000,000 bits = 1 btc.

2nd layer’s intention is not to compete with credit card transaction rates. Its intention is to outperform them by orders of magnitude. This could transform the system in ways we can’t even predict yet, for example the way we subscribe or rent things might change as we could pay by the second.

A bitcoin wallet is not really a wallet. It is a bank. 
A bank has many accounts that are called **addresses** in Bitcoin. 
Wallet = bank. Account = **address**, or **public key**.
Each **address** has a **private key**.
The **address** or **public key** is, as its name implies, public. Share it with anyone that they can deposit bitcoin into one of your **addresses**.
The **private key** is, as its name implies, private. Don't share it with anyone. Whoever has it can unlock the **address** and spend from it.

That (BCH's EDA) is different to what I asked as it primarily uses *time* (12 hours) not *blocks*, and that's why it has E in its name. I agree it is stupid, and opens BCH to being gamed by miners, and is generally bad for the entire crypto community.
Using a rolling average every *n* blocks (where *n* is a lot smaller than 2016) but keeping the average based on 2016 blocks, or perhaps more than 2016 blocks, but adjusting more often, we'd see a *smoother* difficulty adjustment, and more often.

I nearly died earlier this year. And had some time to think about it while at it.
The best memories, the greatest moments of your life, the ones you'll miss the most, that you want to relive the most, are events that are "free". 
The sunbeams coming through your childhood bedroom window. The feel of the early summer sun in the backyard of your grandma's place. The sound of your mother's voice. Your best friend. Your dog. The day you rode your bicycle all the way to the other side of the city. Your first cigarette after school and the feeling of comradery. The face of your first crush. Your first kiss. Being all alone on an empty beach. Being underwater watching the bubbles rise into the sunlight above. Being half asleep on a hot afternoon, a gentle breeze gently rustling the leaves. 
None of these require money. At all.
I didn't think about any career or financial accomplishment at all when I was dying. Nothing at all to do with "success". 
Now, you're not wrong. You're not wrong at all. Having money absolutely does provide for comfort and enjoyment in life. There's simply no argument against that. 
I'm just pointing out that *the cream* of life, the *absolute* best moments are absolutely free.

Going into debt using an inflationary currency is the same as saving using a deflationary currency. 
In the former the debt reduces, because inflation. In the latter the savings increase, because deflation.
Don't think there won't be problems with a deflationary currency. It's not the first time in history we've had one.


That's people that are already rich. Large holders of a deflationary currency will get *richer* just by holding it. In an inflationary world the opposite is true; it loses its value.
By the way the percentage of people holding all the wealth in bitcoin is far, far, far worse than the fiat world.

Gold has intrinsic value. It can be used to make jewellery, cups and goblets, and crowns. 
And you know what the intrinsic value of jewellery is? Gold!
When the first fleet arrived in Australia they gave the aborigines clothes and blankets and such. They later found them discarded because they had no value to an aborigine. 
Our parents’ parents’ ... parents’ were brainwashed by society and culture that gold is the most valuable thing in the world. It isn’t. 
Before you even begin to understand bitcoin you have to start at the beginning; what is money? 
It is a type of grease that facilitates trade. That is its utility and its intrinsic value is based on how well it works as a form of money, as that grease. 
Previous popular forms of money throughout history include spices, shells, gold, and government issued fiat. The last one is the only form of money that didn’t come about via [emergence](

Hijacking this vapid top post. 
I thought the questions asked were excellent. I thought Andreas’ answers very informative. Especially interesting to me where his illustrations of how both the current banking industry and bitcoin  can continue to function as designed by using a hybrid custodial system; essentially multi-signature wallets. 
The biggest hurdle today is security. It’s too good, too complicated for the average user. And the biggest irony is that to safely store private keys for large amounts we need bank vaults to keep seed phrases safe (for most people). 
I can see a future of checktimelockverify, multisignatures and hybrid custodial systems to bring both the security of bitcoin and the ease of use of our traditional systems together. Users can always be their own banks if they want to be. 
Satoshi has central/reserve banks in his/her/their/its sights, not your local branch. 
The first question posed regarding transfer of funds for criminal activities was also an excellent one. Everyone gets asked this eventually about bitcoin. As Andreas illustrated the current system uses cash anyway, so bitcoin isn’t any different. However, I think we have to admit bitcoin makes it easier to send funds without identification across borders instantly, by design. It certainly doesn’t solve this problem. 
Question: how long does Andreas talk because I’m in a lunch break and have to stop.

edit: Just checking; you do know you can buy 0.00001 btc, right? You don't have to buy a whole one?
i.e. you just lost half of the dollar value, chickens, milk, oil, pork belly futures, or whatever it is you bought. Makes no difference what, or how much, just the **percentage**.

It’s super, super, super speculative, and highly unlikely, but if btc replaces a currency completely, perhaps a country that is experiencing hyper inflation, then the exchange rate with that country’s currency would actually go to infinity. (As would every other currency).

Agreed that “investing” is probably not the correct attitude. Perhaps.  Nonetheless people can do what they want. 
I’ve exchanged my dollarydoos for bitcoin as it is simply a very utilitarian form of money, especially so for the Internet. It works better in many situations than digital fiat.
Now, fiat is also nothing more than 1s and 0s on a database somewhere, literally,  but because so many people use it it has utility as a form of money. Its strength being its enormous user base. (Backed by the government means the government is both the distributor and a major user). 
But on a purely utilitarian valuation bitcoin is excellent. As the most simple example you can send me money, right now, if I post my address here. Just like that. Compare that to sending me digital fiat. 
That for me and many others is one of its main strengths; the transfer of value is technically super elegant. 
For me its also that it is both a currency (little ‘b’ bitcoin) *and* a platform for building an entire internet of money (big B Bitcoin). Features and apps will be built on top of it. The best analogy is probably Linux, which is now by far the world’s most popular operating system. 
The Internet came for mail, publishing, music, media, and now it comes for money. What do you think will happen?

Your friend’s mum is putting the icing, candles and all on the cake and baking it, all at once. She buys alt coins. 
Your operating system is built in layers. Basic operations with all the hardware are built as a layer and made solid and dependable. Then parts of this layer are exposed to higher layers that they can easily talk to the hardware. All the complicated work is summarised into something like SendToSpeakers(&amp;sound). The second layer might be something like an music application. 
Literally all technology is built in layers, with fire sitting at the bottom of it all. Think about what we did with fire, and then what we did with that, and then that and on and on and on.

It is indicative of what could happen in *every* country.
If bitcoin really is that much better than government issued fiat, and it really catches on, more and more people will move toward it, exchanging their dollars or euros or yens or whatevers for bitcoin.
As it goes mainstream household goods' values start to be listed in bitcoin too. People's mindsets start to value things in bitcoin too.
At about this point governments themselves have to decide whether to start moving their wealth to bitcoin or not. If not then they are going to realise that it's not the value of bitcoin rising, but the value of their own currency falling. Especially if household good values' stay constant against bitcoin, but not dollars, euros, yens or whatevers.
The network effect goes essentially exponential; everyone is affected. You might see it in one country first, then another and another. It might spread, probably starting with unstable currencies, but who knows? Maybe not.
The best way at this point for any government to stop the outflow of their currency to bitcoin is by shutting down the exchanges. It's coming to your country too.
Look, this is the extreme outcome, I personally don't think it will go that far, but it's not impossible. And I'm not even sure that is a good outcome; have the world up-ended like that; wealth transferred just because some people got in early.

So... why wouldn’t you pay someone in depreciating dollars instead of appreciating btc? It’s turtles all the way down man. 
It’s also a catch-22. Bitcoin can’t be used widely as a currency until it stabilises in exchange rate, and it won’t stabilise until it is widely used. On top of that again it can’t be widely used until something like LN exists but nobody is going to use LN until it is widely used and stabilised. 
It needs something to bootstrap it into being used more universally.

At the moment *it is* an investment, and a poor currency. There's not many places accepting it. 
I suspect the layer two applications may change all that, eventually. 
It's silly to be paying for even a Lamborghini using Bitcoin, if it's going up relative to fiat at the rate it is; you could have waited a month and bought the Lamborghini for a 20% discount. Wait a year and it's half price. 
So everyone hodls it. Naturally. 
It won't be a currency until it reaches some sort of saturation point, and the price stabilises. 
Or, it might become something entirely different and new. It's an experiment after all. And the internet was never intended for people to share photos of their lunch, conduct geopolitical propaganda, nor support a digital crypto currency. 
Perhaps the idea of it being a currency will be laughable in twenty years, as it has become something entirely different.

Your dollars are also a bunch of 0's and 1's. Their only intrinsic value is the system they are used in, and that system's trust in, essentially, itself. Banks, credit cards, cash, mortgages; the whole lot. The entire system and all its users; the network.
The intrinsic value of bitcoin is Bitcoin. Little 'b' and big 'B'. The former is the currency, the latter is the payment system. The two are bound together, one and the same. A currency and a payment system at the same time. A new paradigm.
You can certainly argue that bitcoin is nothing but 1's and 0's but Bitcoin is an elegantly arranged collection of 1's and 0's that is the first global, decentralised, peer-to-peer payment system, that is also insanely secure, and does all its auditing and accounting itself, automatically.

This works if the dip goes below where you sold at the new ATH. Importantly, the *start of* the new ATH. 
If the dip doesn’t then you are buying back in at a higher price than you sold. It doesn’t matter that you are making profit in fiat if you are losing btc (in a rising btc market).

I have no argument against that. But you are calling people fools that are simply short of some facts.
If they *knew* the facts, and ignored it anyway, then they would be fools. 
The vast majority of people that keep bitcoin on exchanges don't know a monitor from a computer from a modem. They haven't heard of Mt. Gox. They don't understand how bitcoin works. Their PCs and phones are infected with viruses. They can't get a hardware wallet for 6 months.

1BTC is not much.
[Bitcoin distribution](
1 btc is in in *the bottom* 0.06%. And that is all calculated on single *addresses*, not individuals. You could safely half or even quarter that again.
I mean you're not even in the top half until you have somewhere between 100 and 1,000, on a single address. i.e. millions of dollars worth.

Again, it's not the currency, it's the payment system. 
Me &gt; money &gt; you
Me &gt; bank &gt; money &gt; bank &gt; money &gt; you
Which is more efficient? D'uh. 
The former might take minutes and cost a few cents. The latter might take days and cost a few dollars. 
That's because the former is more efficient. And not a little more efficient, far more efficient. It has to be a far superior currency to make any impact because of the existing currencies network effect. 
For example I could send you 0.001 bitcoin right now. Straight from me to you. Electronic cash. Peer to peer. 
To do the same with a dollar or a yen or a euro would take days and would go through many systems. (I probably don't the same currency as you). 
Bitcoin the payment system, with its baked in auditing and accounting and security and everything else is FAR superior to the mainstream system. That's why you have heard of it.

I'm not familiar with how Gemini have setup this "pre-credited deposit" thing but it sounds like they'll let you purchase crypto before your funds clear, because you are a top bloke, but not let you *move* the crypto until the funds clear. Kinda meeting you half way; you can buy it at now's price but you can't take it home until the funds clear.
Wait for Gemini to respond.
But don't fret too much about leaving your crypto on an exchange for a day or so. That's not overly dangerous. The problem occurs when people use an exchange like a wallet, and leave all their crypto on it all the time. See Mt. Gox.

Visa, Mastercard et al are not a payment system and a currency at the same time. 
They are not free to use; the merchant adds on the cost to the price. In Australia here that cost is required to be added on and displayed for each transaction, typically about 1-2%, and 3% for Amex. We have a constant reminder, other places are just being sneaky.
No, the points don't make up for even half of that cost. Don't forget annual fees.
There are definitely international exchange fees. Check your statement.
They are also not instant, albeit the consumer is not aware of that. Settlement can even take months.
Look, I agree with you that the experience is one of instant and free transactions worldwide, but tucked away underneath it is nothing of the sort. How do the credit card companies make money? It's not all from interest.
And the entire system of my bank, credit card systems, the underlying systems that *they* use, international exchanges, regulations, auditing, security, and another bank on the other end - networks of layers of entities of networks of entities of layers - is very cumbersome and complicated compared to Bitcoin, which don't forget has auditing, accounting and security and even a currency all baked in. The *actual* transfer of money using the current system is not at all as instant as it is made to appear.
In the end the stronger currency will win out. It always has.
Would I bet everything on bitcoin? Fuck no. But it's certainly a contender, and even a favourite to win.

I'm a family man in his forties. Can you imagine how hard it would be for me to buy drugs? Probably eight or nine degrees of separation (these days). 
And the desire to exchange dollars for crypto would be even less then my desire for an E (next to nothing) if I had to go through "the black market" to do it. 
Banning exchanges would certainly, *certainly* cut out the entire "mainstream" from adopting bitcoin. 
Comparing the innate desire to get high, drugs, to crypto currency isn't a good comparison. They are completely different things. They are not comparable markets. 
I'm totally with you, in that crypto cannot be stopped, but if exchanges are banned it will never, ever become mainstream. The network effect will effectively have its balls cut off. 
And if it doesn't become mainstream then *I* don't really have much use for it either, and I really believe in bitcoin because of its protocol.
Alas, any medium of exchange *has to be able to be actually exchanged*, and not just in and of itself, or for shit coins. The dollar is of no use to me, or anyone, if it can't be exchanged for anything except other dollars. 
The exchanges are bitcoin's weak point. They are even weaker than the fact it doesn't scale. I think we should be treading very carefully, and respecting any decisions. Play the very long game.

That is correct. You can always send to a public address. 
And yes, when your money is on an exchange it’s not yours. It depends on how much and how paranoid you are. Coinbase does at least seem reasonably professional. 
For cold storage consider a hardware wallet, Trezor or Ledger, or even a paper wallet (add a BIP138 password to the private key). A paper wallet has the same weakest point as a hardware wallet; your written down seed phrase. On a hardware wallet you can add a “25th password”, and on a paper wallet you can add BIP138 encryption (a password). 
I cold store my bitcoin [in a picture :)](

Stealth address. Include eBay txid in the btc transaction message. When a payment is received the eBay txid is used to mark the eBay tx as paid for.

I must not have explained it very well. 
1 bit/microbit = 1/1,000,000 or 0.000001, of 1btc. (100 Satoshis = 1 bit). 
[Units of bitcoin]( 
Exchange rate is currently 0.78. Relatively stable. 
So, maths: $0.01/10,000 = 0.000001 = 1 bit. 
To be fair, and I think this illustrates it well, thinking in fractions of a currency sucks. I use bits, not microbits.

Putin has perhaps seen the threat of fiat bleed, speculative attacks, hyperbitcoinisation and all that, before any one else. 
Russians are, generally, intelligent and paranoid. Often a good combination (sometimes not). 
If Russia moves to a completely controlled electronic cash economy then it can effectively prevent all exchange of “cryptoRuble” for bitcoin. 
Yes, some people will still be able to exchange, but not the great, unwashed masses. 
Ta-da; no fiat bleed, no speculative attack. 
You can play this “economic war game” out in your head, the final result is a worthless cryptoRuble. It’s simply not strong enough.

...I got lost at the end there :/
Testing all scenarios a piece of software is going to face is sometimes impossible with your limited resources and time. Reads like they were able to identify the groups of permutations and test them. Or something like that. All the flavours so to speak. 
I've had similar issues testing software where you get to a point and realise the test cases are factorial, and there are probably fringe cases you'll never think of. It's a very unsettling feeling if what you are writing is something a lot of people really depend on.

Running a full node is easy. And you can set it up to run “light” to reduce bandwidth. The initial download is, of course, time and data consuming. Otherwise it’s all completely free. Sites like shopify do that for you; turn key solutions. 
*Everyone agrees it is not practical for continuous Point Of Sale transactions*, like a grocery store. Yet. Lightning intends to change that. Desktop betas are already being test ed. If that takes off bitcoin might become huge very quickly. 
Nonetheless there are many day-to-day business transactions that currently work just fine. I know tradesmen that accept bitcoin simply onto their mobile phones. Scan QR &gt; done. This works just fine for a few transactions a day.

It most certainly does.

Inequality grows and that is not good for any society. It's not good for the poor and it's also not good for the rich, as history has shown again and again.

Multisignature addresses are useful for, say, companies where to move funds it would require two, or more, people to sign the transaction.

1. make backups of your seed phrase.
2. use a hard to guess pin (but easy to remember).
3. use a 25th password/phrase that is hard to guess (but easy to remember).

This is both a node and a wallet. It is different to the wallets you use on your phone or PC as it uses *the entire* blockchain, not just headers. It is the real deal. This means you will have to download the entire blockchain before you can do anything.
When running it works as a full node. It will be verifying transactions on the Bitcoin network. That's it.
Now, watch your bandwidth get chewed up.
If you want to run your node very "light" you can set it to not serve up historical blocks to other nodes, but still verify transactions in the current block. In the config file set maxuploadtarget=0.  [source](

Bitcoin’s ledger is immutable. It stores. Once something is on there it is not coming off. Ever.

Just to make something clear bitcoin is not stored in wallets. Bitcoin is always is stored on the blockchain. Online. They are created when a block is mined and all transactions are an IOU pointing back to them. Wallets store keys to addresses, which themselves contain the unspent transactions; bitcoin IOUs.
It's a subtle difference, and perhaps confusing at first, but something that may make things clearer in future. It's also something most people misunderstand. It's not unlike the paper notes in your wallets representing ...something. They are unspent transactions too; IOUs. Bitcoin is electronic cash, the only difference is it isn't limited to fixed denominations; $5, $10, $20 and so on.
Basically: Wallets store addresses and their keys, which store a bunch of notes/unspent transactions/IOUs. Actual bitcoin is stored on the blockchain.
I digress. Sorry. : )
You can connect your Trezor to Electrum and the signing of transactions still takes places offline,  air-gapped, in the little Trezor computer.

[What is a fork?](
edit: urgh; i can never figure out out to add links with ")" in them.


Because [Bitcoin is an open source project]( *anyone* can download the code, modify it, copy it, and do whatever they like with it. If there are arguments about which way the project should go one team will make **a fork**, a copy, and the project will now go in two directions. Like a fork in a road.
Note that when Bitcoin is forked usually the entire blockchain is also copied. That means any addresses you own on the original fork you now also own on the copied fork. Free money/weird shit.
One fork usually withers and dies. Happens to all sorts of open source projects. See: Open Office and Libre Office.
Pro tip: Follow the best and/or most developers. If a small team of inexperienced developers makes a fork it is unlikely to succeed compared to the original. (exceptions might be when it is made into something entirely different)

Yes, plus all the transaction fees. See: [the first line in this block]( No inputs.
Now, your chances of winning. Take [the total hash rate]( and divide that by your hash rate. They are your odds, every 10 minutes.
To compare to a weekly lotto ticket multiply that chance for each 10 minute block by 10,000 blocks per week. They are your weekly odds if you mine 24/7.
Your mid-tier GPU will not be as good as a [cheap ASIC miner](
I've been doing exactly this with a [GekkoScience 2Pac]( while running a full node. Cost about $100 and runs at 15GH/s. Electricity is negligible.
So, my chances are a little better than 1:1billion every 10 minutes. 1:100,000 every week. Odds are I'll solve a block in 2,000 years if the hash rate stays constant.
Still, that's better than lotto, if I have all my numbers^10 correct, and I run a full node to help the network.

Coinbase’s fees are huge, but the Australian exchanges rates are *expensive*. Which is why the exchange rates are hard to find before you buy. 
Because of arbitrage it is **overall** the same price to buy on Coinbase as it is on an Aussie exchange. Unfortunately. I blame the Aussie exchanges for charging the Australia Tax when they don’t have to. I use Coinbase because instant buy and no *completely unnecessary Australia Tax*. **It’s unaustralian. **
That is; you are going to end up paying about 5% above global rates if you use an Australian exchange, or Coinbase. 
Edit: Australian exchanges have both high buy and high sell rates. If you include credit card point in your Coinbase costs you can subtract ~1%.

The experiment has a while to play out yet. 
I reckon we'll have investment firms and perhaps even governments ~~investing~~ converting some currency soon, and then mainstream adoption at sites like Amazon, companies like Uber and so on.
The biggest hurdle yet to come will be governments possibly banning it because of its disruptive nature. While that couldn't kill bitcoin it could completely cripple it and send it back to the realm of tinkering computer nerds again, and tank the exchange rate. That's still at least a year or more away though, and if anything looks more likely to not happen.

SegWit is all "under-the-hood" changes that users shouldn't even notice. As a user you don't have to do anything.
When the software you are using as a wallet updates to use SegWit addresses you will see new, empty address in that wallet, waiting for you to make transactions into. The new, SegWit addresses start with a '3', the old ones start with a '1' (and will continue to work indefinitely).
Until you make a transaction there is literally nothing to do.
The first transaction you make from one SegWit address to another will be when you are fully using SegWit.
Again, it's all "under-the-hood" type stuff that users don't really need to know about. It's akin to a new OS file system I suppose, something like that.
[Trezor has a good blog post]( explaining all that and more. You can keep clicking the links and dive into it as deep as you dare.
Lightning is not active yet. It's a second layer being built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, not unlike a layer in the TCP/IP stack. It intends to sort of collate a whole bunch of transactions for a given hour/day/week/month into one, single transaction on the underlying Bitcoin blockchain layer. This will theoretically allow for instant confirmations on the 2nd layer. 
It's still very much in development and when it comes out you'll just start using it like you do with Visa, PayPal et all now.

What is the fundamental difference between Litecoin and Bitcoin testnet? Not. Much.
I really don't get litecoin, out of all of them. It has 2.5 minute transactions, which are still too slow for daily use, and it uses a different POW, that ASICs could be made for if there was a demand.
Zealots talk about "using bitcoin for long term, large amounts and moving a little each day to a litecoin wallet." Why? Why bother exchanging at all? It's just an extra step with no benefit.
Cheap tx rates? Sure. But only because it's unpopular.
There's a very, very good reason entire countries, regions and so on use *one, single currency*. That's simply because it's a pain in the arse to use more than one. Using multiple currencies takes us *back* to bartering, where we had to keep track of how many sheep were worth a donkey, and how many donkeys were worth a bride. The *entire reason money was invented* was to move away from this.
So, in the end stronger currencies will force out the weaker ones. Nobody will accept them. People *want to* use one, single currency. 
And right now the value of *all* of the alt coins, put together, the sum of, are closer in value to 1 btc on testnet, zero, than they are to the sum of btc alone.
P.S./edit: I *like* litecoin. It's great. It works. But so what?

If that receiving address is in the same wallet it will be fine. 
Wallets are made up of many addresses, a new one for each transfer is only for privacy reasons. You can send as many transactions to a single address as you want, no problem. Just make sure you have the keys for it, or the wallet that generated it.

Mid 40s Australian, I’ve never even used a cheque. 
Australian banks let you add a note to the electronic transaction. Australian banks have instant transfers between banks using apps. Every bill has BPAY. Tap’n’go cards are ubiquitous. We are practically cashless. 
Sound familiar?
All that and I still prefer bitcoin. 
P.S. I think New Zealand is the most advanced country on earth at this time. Stable economy, carbon neutral, no foreign investors (NZ is too popular right now), gay marriage, fibre to the home. As an Aussie that’s really saying something.

If my money is in a bank, I do not have it.
If the bank lends it out, somebody else has it.
If that somebody puts it in a bank, they do not have it.
etc. It is the same amount of money in the system. Not everybody has the same money/coin at once. We are sharing it different points in time. Time Division. I "think" I have the money, but in actual fact someone else has it. 
It works exactly the same with cash or bitcoin. 
This is not how money is made, it happens further up the chain. I know everybody thinks otherwise.

Reads like Gemini will give you the balance of your deposit before it clears, if you are a top bloke. You must be a top bloke.

Bitcoin is "digital cash". The banks worked just fine for hundreds of years using cash; IOUs. The unspent transactions in your wallets' addresses are IOUs.
There's no reason one couldn't store their money/btc in a CoinBaseBank ^tm account and receive interest on it while they lend it out for interest, leaving say 10% in their coffers just in case there was a run.
No more btc can be made, but it can be shared just fine.
If bitcoin is money then banks can use it just fine. And if bitcoin is money then it can be borrowed and loaned, just like cash can. And people will still need to borrow money. 
Your local branch is not what bitcoin is trying to avoid. There are banks and then there are *central banks*.

As a noob I must say this is the most surprising, may I say *horrifying*, "feature" of Bitcoin. 
I dread to think of how many people think that they have, and actually do have, a safe, cold-storage wallet, but have not come to the point of using the btc in it, yet. It's a bit like doing backups but never testing the restore.
The most logical thing to do with a big, fat, store of cold bitcoin when you finally come to use it is to spend a *little bit first*, not knowing that you probably just lost *all* of the rest. Which is probably going to happen to everyone not familiar with **bitcoin change addresses**.
@_date: 2017-07-24 23:28:47
Transactions can be signed on a computer that has never been online, and never will be. You can sign a transaction from this computer using a paper wallet. You then transfer *the transaction* to an online computer to be broadcast.
For convenience sake a cold-storage wallet would be easier, but it's all the same; completely offline; the private keys are *never* on a computer that has *ever* been connected to the internet.

(People: correct me where wrong. I'm enjoying too much IPA. See username. Serious. I like to learn. )
Governments like *inflation* to be around 2-3%. This is considered a "Goldilocks zone". Reserve banks can affect inflation by lending money at set interest rates. Higher rates to reduce inflation, lower rates to increase inflation.
GDP is simply a measure of how much money is moving around, from you to me to them to them to you. If you and I were in a country of two people, and over a year I gave you one unit to do something, and you gave me one unit to do something else, our country's GDP would be 2 units. 
By adjusting base (base?) interest rates reserve banks can adjust the amount of money flowing around, because it's cheap/expensive to borrow, so more people borrow more money and spend more money, and thus money is easier to come by, so worth less, so more inflation, thus reserve banks can (crudely) control inflation. 
Also the government might *create money* (yep) via government bonds, essentially borrowing money from its citizens to pay for government  services. (Creating money isn't hard, you can do it too)
(Moving to Belgian beer now)
So, you may ask, where does *deflation* come into this? 
(Oh, yum)
If you have savings in a bank, and your country is experiencing very high inflation - see Zimbabwe - your savings are rapidly becoming worthless as the price of everything goes up. However, in a *deflating* economy the price of everything goes *down*. 
As there will only be 21m bitcoin, ever, all things going to plan the bitcoin economy will see *deflation*. So one week a loaf of bread might cost 10 satoshi (1,000,000th of a bitcoin), and the next week it might cost 9 satoshi. 
This is because more and more people want bitcoin, and there are no more to be found; they go up in value intrinsically (that could be the wrong word); deflation.

Early adopters (I wish I was one) get the benefits. I'm coming around more and more to the idea that Bitcoin is more like gold than a normal currency. It is not designed to be transacted constantly. It is more a store of wealth like gold, bonds, or property.
In that respect once all coins have been mined, and interest in it has plateaued, its price will be far, far more stable. Like gold and property.
People who buy it then are not *speculators*, they are investors, or simply storing wealth in it. 
*Anyone* who holds bitcoin now is *speculating*. No question. Speculation carries with it far more risk, and thus higher rewards.

What national currency *is* backed by are the people using it, including the government. It's backed by all of the people in the country that will exchange it and value it. The system.
I think people imagine national currency is like shares in a big stack of gold that is the government. The notes are "certificates of authenticity". Nope.
I guess you could argue that the government "back it" in that they do their best to maintain its value, although at times it is better that they devalue the currency, to make exports more competitive for example.

Best answer so far.
Man, now I've been contemplating this some more the entire concept of cold storage, be it an encrypted wallet on a usb drive, a paper wallet, a mnemonic seed, is no different to having cash. It could be a very large amount of cash. How should we really keep this cash safe? If you had 100 btc where are you going to store your mnemonic seed/paper wallet/usb? Where is actually safe? 
Where and how would you safely store this address? 1JCe8z4jJVNXSjohjM4i9Hh813dLCNx2Sy

Work as a developer myself and fully recognise that often tests can be incorrect; the test *itself* fails; it's a stupid, invalid, or completely unrealistic test.

Have a strategy. Hold for 5 years, or, hold for 5 years and sell half, or,   hold until a certain price then sell half.
Do you have a strategy? If not, you are gambling. Literally. : |
It's really worth coming up with a strategy and *actually sticking to it*.
Mine is to buy until I accumulate a small number of btc. I haven't reached that number yet so the drop in price is actually a good thing for me : )

I like to assume English as a second, or third, language. 
Still, bitcoins are being mined; bitcoin is still in an *inflatory* cycle; its value against other currency has been increasing at that ridiculous rate while *inflating*. What will happen once that last coin is mined?

Pretty much. Yeah. 
The scenario is: backing up to a paper wallet, and then some time in the future actually using the btc in it. A pretty common scenario. Perhaps the gold standard of Joe Average interaction; playing it safe; being their own bank.
If not done correctly, and I argue the most natural way top do "it" is *incorrectly*, when first using the cold storage wallet the change is going to be sent to a "change address". This is because the first thing Average Joe (me) will do will be to send a test transaction of a small amount, from the paper wallet.
I guess, ultimately, I would like to know how to use the funds in a paper wallet with all change going *back to the same wallet*. Or, being able to at last *receive the change* one way or another. Intuitively.
I speak for the n00bs; we are going to fuck this up big time; and when we realise it will be too late; and there are a lot of us. 
General observation: that Bitcoin is so distributed can actually be a con, sometimes (nothing is perfect). There is no central point of documentation. Or so it goes.

CoinJar has an EFTPOS card, which would work pretty much *anywhere* in Australia. It's very rare you can't pay using "tap'n'go" in Australia. (I am wondering why I carry cash at all anymore, it's inconvenient, dirty, and slower.)
[CoinJar Swipe](
Now, CoinJar is a [Market Maker]( which may go some way to explaining how they've been able to create a way to pay via EFTPOS in bitcoin.

These two pieces of advice contradict each other.


Using dollar cost averaging will ensure you are buying at the second best time.
Exaggerate dollar cost averaging to see the problem clearly; should you invest $10k now or spread it out over 10 years?

I've created an offline wallet in Electrum. Still offline I've created a paper wallet for one of the addresses. I then moved btc to that address on another computer, at a later date. The only part of the wallet that has ever been online is the public key for that one address. 
I used bitkey for those offline steps by the way.
The paper wallet is then given a lucky kiss and locked away, same as a hardware seed phrase would be. 
If I get killed by a escaped orang-utan on a rampage my family would hopefully eventually come across the paper wallet and be able to actually use it. I've written "use bread wallet" on it.
I don't follow your concern with the manual import/export/transact with the private key. If my family shoves my body aside and can eject the orang-utan from the room they could use BreadWallet to scan the private key, and import (actually sweep by default) the address and its funds. So long as the orang-utan doesn't return they should be sweet, and they can go buy ferraris.
That book would be incredible, but I'm not sure I could find enough bookshelf space to store it.

This has been around for a long, long time. Australia here and we have the same. I assume it is common in most countries.
The idea is to alert authorities to drug dealers, money launderers, terrorists(?) who have traditionally dealt in cash, for obvious reasons.
Seriously, when is the last time you or anyone you know had $10k+ in cash? 
And if you, say, sell your car for $11k and some dick gives it to you all in cash, just fill in the form when depositing and you'll be fine (I've done exactly this). They are looking for repeat offenders, not people like you or I.
If you are *consistently* depositing $10k+ cash then, well you have to admit that is unusual. Unless you're a business that deals in a lot of cash (in which case fill in the form).
It's a boring response to your post, I know. Sorry.

Not all stock are income producing assets. Many well known companies produce a loss; no income/dividends. 
They may produce an income in future, or they may spend their entire existence pouring money into a hole, which is even worse than worthless bitcoin.

It might be easier to memorise 24 numbers than it is to memorise 24 words. 
My mobile is 10 digits. So is my wife’s. I’ve had many phone numbers since being a kid I can remember. Ditto post codes. I could probably easily recall a 50 digit number this way. 
They are not the most secure of choices, of course. Just pointing out how it may be easier to memorise numbers.

Goldman Sachs have been behind bitcoin for a while.










What the posted article is, this thread, is a [technical analysis]( It's very different from fundamental analysis. It's pure numbers and does not take into account ...well doesn't even take into account what bitcoin is at all; it's not relevant for technical analysis.
It's the history of the stock price, volumes, and so on. *Pure numbers*. This is used against an *enormous* database of historical data for other stocks, currencies, financial instruments, tulips, etc. which then go into calculating the most likely path for this "stock" to go. 
Some call technical analysis voodoo.

To be fair, currencies have been used as investment mediums for a very long time. It's hard to evaluate what percentage of btc is used as currency, and what as investment. 
But it is the same for something like the $US too; massive amounts are kept as investments or hedges. Hell, Australia is *missing* the vast majority of its $100 notes.

Aren't the swings in value against other currencies though? In a world where **bitcoin** is our currency then milk, rent and so on would stay far more static, if it changed at all.
The world you describe is a world where *both* bitcoin and a local currency are our currency; milk and rent is still actually paid in local currency; milk and rent are pegged at the local currency, not bitcoin.
I.e. the $AUD has fluctuated against the $USD over the past 15 years from around 0.5 to around 1.1. The prices of milk and rent in Australia had no practically no relationship to this at all. Negligible.

I'm with you. I was referring to how btc is affected by market sentiment far more than, say, pork futures. There are a huge number of variables affecting the latter; weather, pig food prices, poultry prices, recent releases of childrens' movie starring a baby pig, and so on.
Whereas btc is kinda isolated from all of that, and market sentiment plays a much higher value. I'd say TA would be more accurate for btc than for your average stock.
e.g., this [recent Goldman Sachs]( note will be somewhat a self fulfilling prophesy.


Somewhat ironically for this conversation the Technical Analysis produced a report that will affect market sentiment.

@_date: 2017-06-29 03:07:12
Sure, currencies don't stay static, *against other currencies*.
But in a world where **bitcoin** is our currency then we pay for everything in btc. There's no converting it, there's no comparing it to other currency to determine the price of milk. 1btc = 1btc.
If it cost the milk producer 1btc to produce 1l of milk, and they sell it to the stores in bulk for 1.5btc, and the stores sell it for 2btc... then why would the price be fluctuating at all?
Remember, this is in **a world** where **bitcoin is our currency**. There's no conversion. 
In our current situation, where bitcoin is **not** our currency, we have to convert to USD or GBP or whatever to purchase the milk. That is completely different.
