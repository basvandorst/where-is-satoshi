unfortunately, however, the only viable only legal recourse now is to pay the tax and then file for a refund in district court to challenge the notice.

This is overly cautious behavior, probably required by the banks they work with. It is not really a reasonable interpretation of their obligations under the law.
However, the "already been laundered" angle doesn't work - they still need KYC to make reports for other reasons. Remember there are two types of money laundering: illegal business and terrorism financing. Terrorism financing requires obscuring the destination of the funds, not the source. They don't know if you are financing terrorism until later (or never) and need to have the records in advance.

Well, they may be exempt. Here's the law: 
"provided, however, that nothing in this article shall apply to a bank, trust company, private banker, foreign banking corporation licensed pursuant to article two of this chapter or foreign banking company authorized to operate pursuant to the International Banking Act of 1978 (12 USC 3101 et seq.), as amended, savings bank, savings and loan association, an investment company, a national banking association, federal reserve bank, corporation organized under the provisions of section twenty-five-a of an act of congress entitled the "Federal Reserve Act", federal savings bank, federal savings and loan association or state or federal credit union." - See more at:
