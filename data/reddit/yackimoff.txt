It's not actually a Bank of Russia. It's Volgograd prosecutor office. Would not seem a big deal. The concern is that thanks to new laws in Russia any site may be blocked without any trial order. This might lead to btc-e.com blocked in Russia. But nothing more, I suppose.
EDIT: accusations are laughable. Probably, the issue is that Volgograd is the town that suffered from recent terrorists attacks. The guys try to show that they work hard at preventing that in the future.

The price of GHS goes lower because difficulty goes up. And difficulty always goes up nowadays.
EDIT: consider GHS a share on a market where each two weeks a dilution occurs. One share = 4 GHS. The difficulty number is shares outstanding.
GHS on CEX.IO has always been overpriced though.

The extension compares scripts that came from Blockchain.info with those stored on official Blockchain.info account on GitHub.
Therefore, to modify javascript an attacker would have to hack GitHub as well.

Maybe. But I'd better try to predict operating hashpower.
As an example: if we calculate from now using such calculator estimating 40% difficulty increase per month (which is just right about now), we end up having difficulty 1,200,000,000 by July 2014.
I just don't think it's realistic having 11,000+ TH/s network in just a year. It's 2 million Jalapeños ($ 500 mln), or 1 million blades (฿ 18 mln), or 27,000 Jupiters ($ 192 mln).

How can two sides of a fork continue to live together and be exchanged? This means that up to the last shared block, all unspent outputs are now exist here and there and can be spent here and there. Meaning that everyone doubled his wealth out of thin air.
I don't think that's something possible in real life.
EDIT: it seems that I missed the thread where it has already been discussed. Sorry about that.

I know how to use it. I just don't like the terms millibits or millibitcoins and using metric prefixes. As for millibits, less technical people can even confuse with data size.

No, you don't have *one* private key. The wallet is a set of private keys for each address connected.

I'm aware of that one. But I thought about a calculator capable of calculating with a *linear* difficulty raise as opposed to *exponential*.

I did sell a half of my holdings three days prior to the crash. And I've thus returned all the investments I made. The situation appeared very hot to me for some irrational reason. Too many media attention. Too many “it’s a bubble!” articles. Very unprofessional investors jumped into bitcoins.
I personally have opened the bitcoin last December. That's when it started to inflate. I've learned of it because of Silk Road. So, I suppose, that was the starting point not only for me. The informational creep started to grow since then.
However, I've left the other half untouched. I do believe bitcoin is a great thing. I doubt it will change the world, though. At least not in observable years.
Well, what's the point? The point is that that time back in December $13 seemed to be the intrinsic value. Since then it should've grown as more geeks have been involved, let alone the bubble component caused by speculators. So I don't think bitcoin will fall down to zero, I don't think it will fall down to, say, $20 either. If it will, I'll definitely buy tons of it.
As for the crash, so the more dips come, the more mature the market becomes, the less panicking users are, the less the course is sensitive to manipulations.
