This also applies to mobile wallets as well (though I don't know which ones). Basically when you set up your wallet it gives you a seed, a passphrase of a few words that is like the password of your email, because your coins are online (don't know where exactly, this stuff is complicated). This means that if your PC or smartphone die or are stolen you can still access your coins if you put the seed on another device with the same wallet software.


Not necessarily, for instance I use Electrum (considered to be the best wallet) both on my PC and my Android phone.


That's right, not worth the risk in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:42:01
Then do it.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:50:03
Except ETH. It just keeps going up. Should've sold some LTC at ATH for ETH...

TIL. That sounds like a pathetic attempt at making bcash succeed. *Although* I visited the "about" page and it doesn't say a thing about "Bitcoin Cash", it actually specifies "Get paid to retweet the messages that **you** like or pay others to spread your messages.". So on paper it sounds like I can get paid for retweeting non-bcash tweets right? But yeah I just realized the second part implies that Roger is paying for bcash shilling.
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:10:25
Why do I find this gif hilarious?
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:44:36

@_date: 2017-12-07 16:36:57
Yep, I see! Going up hundreds second by second!

Is it ever going to stop? I'm waiting for a dip to buy some more. Definitely won't buy right now because I *know* it's going to drop as soon as I buy.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:31:36
BTC experts, cash out now and rebuy during drop or just HODL? (serious)
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:29:22
From €8k to €16k in a week and still rising. This is truly insane.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:40:28
I fell for it too, they aren't saying "mate" all the time. It's actually "Mate 1: *thing*, Mate 2: *other thing*". It's the formatting.

@_date: 2017-12-07 14:23:30


Had to look it up but yes, basically. I'm relatively new to Bitcoin and only bought once at 7k, and when I did it immediately dropped to 5.5k. It recovered quickly so it wasn't that bad, but I'm still mad for the lost profits!
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:31:47
Still huge, LTC is ~50¢ right now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:41:06
Going to hodl then. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:37:54
So guaranteed crash incoming? I already asked this on another thread, but would it be better to cash out now and rebuy after the drop or just HODL and hope for the best?
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:21:32
A clone of Bitcoin made to mislead newbies to think it's the "real" bitcoin. Same logo, same website (bitcoin.com vs .org).

@_date: 2018-08-10 11:27:17
Yeah I know, I thought you were one of them. Still strange that Vitalik would make a tweet on BTCC. Like, why BTCC and not any of the dozens of airdrops?
@_date: 2018-08-01 08:26:49
Well according to  UK is in the 5 worst countries for online privacy, so I guess that has something to do with it.

@_date: 2018-05-29 07:20:10
I know, but having all the info in one single post with the math already done really helps. I actually haven't found a simple yet in-depth post about mining power usage yet.
@_date: 2018-08-10 11:18:05
BTCC? What??? I'm sure Vitalik was talking about BTC, not this... Thing.






Three lines of description and yet they didn't explain a thing on how exactly BTCC differs from Bitcoin. Seems like a generic airdrop cashgrab.

There are a ton of claimable Bitcoin hard forks, but the most valuable are Cash and Gold. Most are only worth a few pennies and honestly not worth the hassle of moving your coins to another address, downloading Chinese wallets or using ["extraction tools"]( and selling on shady Chinese exchanges.

@_date: 2018-03-11 10:31:38
It can put your life at risk. Some people have been robbed point-blank range because they bragged about their BTC on social media. I wouldn't be surprised to hear about criminals killing for bitcoins, after all BTC is money and people kill for money all the time, even for small amounts depending on how desperate they are.
@_date: 2018-02-09 16:22:06
Question about segwit:
How future proof are BIP39 seeds? I've just moved to a P2SH wallet and Electrum's warning about how BIP39 seeds "do not include a version number, which compromises compatibility with future software" kinda freaked me out. Also, [this]( (see "Motivation"). I thought segwit was the future?

That sub should be renamed assuming they aren't all shills.
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:05:26
It doesn't let you go below 5 sat/byte. A while ago I moved to a segwit address and the suggested fee was &gt; 100 sat/byte, but even after enabling custom fees in the settings the lowest I could go was 5 sat/byte. Don't know if it's changed since then.
EDIT: after enabling "Dynamic fees" in settings I can go as low as 4 sat/byte, but not below that.
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:49:37

Just because there are people blindly buying things they don't understand doesn't make them the majority. Actually after this crash it seems like we lost most if not all the weak hands that bought "magic internet money" to become rich fast, not knowing how it works and why.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:35:36
Yeah, I also think (and hope) it goes back up. I'm not buying simply because I used all my spare money in the last three "dips", but it just keeps dipping! But I'm not selling, that's for sure.
@_date: 2018-02-09 18:09:05
Thanks, if BIP39 is one of the most used other than Electrum's I guess it's not going to be outdated anytime soon.
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:35:17
Technically... Because it's the first and most popular. When you say "cryptocurrency" everyone will think "Bitcoin". Then other altcoins may come to their minds if they know any.
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:22:51
This is so pathetic it's actually funny, seeing how desperate they are at keeping bcash relevant. The schadenfreude is strong with this one.

Yeah I think I'm gonna pass.
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:13:29
Thank you. Does that mean there's no reason to "upgrade" to a new BIP standard then? Because as you said mnemonic phrases are just used to generate the addresses and have nothing to do with segwit itself?
EDIT: oh, and what would be other BIP standards that "work with" P2SH segwit (starting with 3)? I could only find BIP39. Is BIP38 exclusive to hardware wallets?
@_date: 2018-07-29 20:47:03
Need a source on that.

Doesn't this apply to cryptocurrencies as a whole?
