The most surprising thing to me is that these types of statements are being made by support and communication personnel and not from executive management.

None of these things address centralization at all. Pooled mining and ASIC mining cause centralization. You think someone spends $300k on ASIC mining gear and thousands per day on electricity and stays up all night worrying about the bandwidth bill for running their node?
Come on! Once upon a time we could all run nodes that actually mined. That was decentralization.
Now "decentralized" means there's, what? 12 people that control most of the worlds mining? And we're acting like these proposals prevent centralized mining? Are you kidding?

I genuinely don't understand the logic people are following. The article presents some evidence and then seems to go back and disprove it all.
1. A "hacker" dropped off some emails and PDFs that they admit can't be verified
1. The PGP signature matches an email that's 1 character off from Satoshi's... Which proves nothing useful and points to a forgery
1. Later they reference the PGP signature as associated with Satoshi despite confirming that it's not
1. He inserted the references to bitcoin into his 2009 blog posts in 2013
Then there's a video of a guy acting like a moron when someone asks when he got into Bitcoin.
How are we coming to this conclusion?

I think some people here are unfamiliar with real estate transactions. Asking a realty firm if they "accept" one currency or another makes no sense -- they're just the people who market the house.
This particular *seller* is willing to accept Bitcoin

Sorry to say, but Venmo already solves this problem better than bitcoin wallets do.
That's mostly because someone else is paying the fees and the developers behind the scenes, but it's true.

"Every time you generate a new address it creates an encrypted backup of your private keys and sends the backup to your email".
Everything sounded good up to here. If you're emailing these out, then the keys ARE getting onto the hot device at some point (even if encrypted), and that's just silly. You're going to an awful lot of trouble to generate the keys offline, only to "encrypt" them with a user-generated password and then not just stick them on the hot device, but then store them all sorts of other servers around the world (over email). *So the only security left is the user's encryption password.*
Keeping the keys on the second pi should be very secure depending on how you've set up that ethernet link between them (despite what others may say). I would suggest allowing for encrypted USB key backups, not this email nonsense.

Taking my hashes off Eligius 
EDIT: Luke, I think you're missing the point. You can change the Eligius transaction policy to whatever you like. You're free to do that and indeed it's an important thing for a pool owner to do.
You can't and shouldn't dictate what the bitcoind default transaction policy is (on Gentoo, or any distro). Default blacklists are fundamentally incompatible with Bitcoin's principles.
You're also deliberately misrepresenting this as a DoS, which no one else seems to agree with. Your claim that SD doesn't pay TX fees is a gross misrepresentation. The TXs are paid for and you know it.
It appears that you've been waging this holy war for quite some time -- here's you spreading your gospel on the wiki:

There is no point in withholding blocks. You'd need a significant % of the pool to cooperate and also withhold blocks in order to effect any change (your individual miner is unlikely to find any blocks to withhold).
If you could convince a significant % of the pool to do something, make it switching pools...
@_date: 2016-01-13 06:20:21
Luke, honest question:
I know you advocate for a smaller block size (500kb, correct?) because you want to be inclusive of a wide range of Internet connection speeds. I also know you have limited bandwidth with where you live.
However you also run a full node and mining pool on a cloud hosting provider where bandwidth is not a huge cost.
So, question: why is the ability to run a full node at your home important to you? Most people with similar bandwidth would be accommodated with SPV. You, and anyone else requiring a private node, can run a full node in the cloud for less than the cost of your home internet connection.
I don't think it's fair to point at the lowest end of US broadband and say a full node must run there. It's okay for full nodes to have some minimum requirements as long as they're reasonable for an average person to obtain. Renting a $5-20/mo VPS is quite reasonable, no?

My mistake, I forgot you'd passed the Eligius torch on. Anyway, a traceroute to the stratum node shows that it's now hosted on DigitalOcean.


I'll grant you this, given that I was mistaken about you running Eligius... I wouldn't store keys with large amounts of Bitcoin in the cloud either. But let's not forget that unless you constructed your machine from raw materials yourself, you are trusting many people along the way. And this isn't all paranoia as you know, with the recent NSA backdoors found in network appliances. The cloud is another leap of trust of course, but it's not the only one. It's up the the end-user to decide what level of trust is necessary for their application, and *there is no situation in which trust is completely absent*.


I asked why it was important for you to run it in your _home_. You've run a physical node offsite before, why can't you now? You can still have trustless security, unless you're using some arbitrary definition of trust, like physically being 5m of your node at all times. Either way, some burden of the cost of the security &lt;-&gt; trust tradeoff must lie with the end-user, and that's okay. For the vast, overwhelming majority of people with $100-$500 in their wallets, the SPV case makes economic sense. And still, even with a modest blocksize increase (e.g., 2-4-8), many, many, many people can run a node in their home just fine.
Also worth noting is that the only major source of pressure for improving home broadband speeds around the world is streaming video. It's okay to add more sources of pressure, it can only help.

You say a hard fork would need support from an overwhelming economic majority, yet you won't let anyone show their support of such a proposal. How are we ever to to reach consensus if you delete every post that casts a vote?

From Satoshi's reply:


Note that this part is no longer true -- "opt-in" Replace-By-Fee was added to core some time ago, which does unfortunately makes accepting zero-conf transactions painful and impractical. Since the opt-in is on the part of the sender, the receiver (the merchant) would need a mechanism to detect if you sent an RBF transaction and then prevent you from leaving with your items until there has been a confirmation.

Still confused as to how to account for margin trades. Perhaps an example?
If I already own 50 ETH, but then borrow 10 BTC to open a margin position (buy) 100ETH. Over the course of holding the position ETH appreciates and I close the position (sell 100 ETH) and receive 11 BTC (net +1 BTC). I now have 1 BTC and 50 ETH.
Where do I derive the cost-basis of the 100 ETH I sold? Do I draw the first 50 from my own ETH and the second 50 at zero? What's the cost-basis of the 1 BTC I now own?

Obfuscating the cost by hiding it in your electricity bill achieves little.

That is not fractional reserve lending. In fractional reserve lending, the bank lends many times more money than it actually has in deposits. That is not possible with Bitcoin.
Edit: It would appear that I am mistaken!

That's not what it says at all.
He says every *user* does not need to be a node, which makes plenty of sense. He does not say that miners shouldn't be nodes, and it is a huge jump to assume that he meant that (he definitely did not).
@_date: 2013-12-30 22:59:49
I did some more research and it would appear that you are correct! My bad.
