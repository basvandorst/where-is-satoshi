Once again, the most relevant topic that needs to be addressed for the entire currency, and the discussion descends into circlejerking by tecchies about gender bias and who is more right. 
The person that addresses the problems associated with bitcoin security, both in wallets and exchanges, will be a very successful person whose name and brand will hold a great deal of value. 
Until that time, enjoy your crypto-entropy discussions and anecdotal posts about buying food with btc. 
Facts are this: people are buying and holding until it can be used. People are getting all excited that this place or that accepts coin (there's even an ATM!), but the currency will have no long lasting value unless practically accepted by a large base of users. 
When Uncle John loses his "goddamn fitty thousint dollurs!" He'll be all pissed and tell his friends they were stolen by the "goddamn turrists". Repeat this story across a broad base of profiles and social circles (change the accent and the amount)  and you haven't got a currency, you have a liability. Just wait until it happens to a business owner. 
When that happens, your bitcoin has no more value than any in-game mmorpg currency. Its only valuable for those that use it, and in the worlds they live in.
