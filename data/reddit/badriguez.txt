A bitcoin is divisible to [8 decimal places]( Why would the relative price of single bitcoin be a deterrent?

Either you are drawing on some other information you have about the EFF, or you are jumping to conclusions.
My reading of that statement is that the EFF's goal is to help provide legal aid to people in need; drawing a target on their back isn't going to help them do that -- even if accepting bitcoin allows for them to accept a (slightly) higher volume of donations.
This applies even more so to Humble Bundle. They aren't trying to be trailblazers. They are trying to help people in need while using *some* innovative techniques.
It would be cool for these organizations to accept bitcoin, but I can't fault them for evaluating risk versus reward in their perspective cases.
